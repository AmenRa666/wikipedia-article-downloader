'''William Taylor''' (1760&amp;nbsp;– 19 July 1842) was an officer in the [[Royal Navy]] who served during the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Entering the navy early in his life, Taylor served as a [[midshipman]] on [[James Cook|Cook's]] [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage of discovery]]. He was promoted shortly after his return to England and commanded ships during the American War of Independence. In common with other officers, he struggled to find employment during the years of peace, but was given a ship to command for a few years in 1788. He was on bad terms with his lieutenant however, and a [[court-martial]] ensued. Taylor returned to an active career on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, still commanding small ships and escorting trade. Promoted to [[post captain]] in 1793, he moved to command several frigates in British waters, or as far afield as North America. His later service was on the African coast, where he took part in the capture of [[Gorée]] in 1801, and in the Caribbean.

He does not appear to have held any seagoing commands during the Napoleonic Wars, but continued to be promoted, rising to [[flag rank]] in 1811. He eventually reached the rank of admiral of the red, before his death in 1842. He was by this time the last surviving officer from Cook's third voyage.

==Early career==
[[File:Captainjamescookportrait.jpg|thumb|[[James Cook]], portrait by [[Nathaniel Dance-Holland]], c. 1775. Taylor sailed with Cook on Cook's [[Third voyage of James Cook|last voyage.]]]]
Taylor was born in 1760 and entered the navy at an early age. By 1776 he was a [[midshipman]], and joined Captain [[James Cook]]'s [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage of discovery]], serving aboard {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB449&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Annual Biography|page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM545&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gentleman's Magazine|year=1842|page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NC432&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schomberg|title=Naval Chronology|page=532}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned with the expedition after Cook's death, and on 28 October 1780 was promoted to lieutenant. The American War of Independence having broken out by now, he saw further service and was soon promoted to commander, on 21 January 1783, and was given command of the [[brig-sloop]] {{HMS|Pelican|1781|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB449&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM545&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield325&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714–1792|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appears to have commissioned the brig-sloop {{HMS|Falcon|1782|6}} in May 1783, but if so, the command was short-lived, and she was under another commander by 1784.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield318&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714–1792|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor instead took command of the 14-gun {{HMS|Cygnet|1776|6}} towards the end of the war with America, and remained in command after the peace, until 1786.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM545&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield276&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714–1792|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor then seems to have spent some time without a ship, before commissioning the 14-gun [[sloop]] {{HMS|Thorn|1779|6}} in January 1788.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM545&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield279&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714–1792|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His command of ''Thorn'' was notable for a [[court-martial]] Taylor brought against his lieutenant, a man named Thackeray. Among other charges, Thackeray was alleged to have gone to Taylor, while he was alone in his [[cabin (ship)|cabin]], and to have called him a &quot;scoundrel&quot; and a &quot;liar&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB487&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |title=Royal Naval Biography|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offence being given in private, the court had only Taylor's word that it was true, creating a brief legal quandary over whether Taylor, who as usual in court-martials, was acting as the prosecutor, could give evidence on his own behalf, and together with the accused. After some deliberation, Taylor was allowed to give his evidence, as criminal trials such as court-martials, were adjudged to be on behalf of [[the Crown]], unlike civil prosecutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB487&quot;/&gt; Thackeray was subsequently stripped of his rank and reduced to a midshipman.&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB487&quot;/&gt; Taylor served in command of ''Thorn'' off [[Shetland]] until 1790, and paid her off after the period of the [[Spanish armament]] had passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM545&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield279&quot;/&gt;

==French Revolutionary Wars==
On the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Taylor commissioned the 12-gun {{HMS|Weazel|1783|6}} in April 1794 and served in the [[English Channel]] and the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield318&quot;/&gt; One of his early tasks was to sail with the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]], and he left [[Spithead]] on 22 May 1793. He accompanied the fleet as far as [[Gibraltar]], and then returned, escorting the homeward-bound trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB488&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |title=Royal Naval Biography|page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AB450&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Annual Biography|page=450}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this service Taylor was promoted to [[post-captain]] on 24 September 1793 and was appointed to command {{HMS|Prompte|1793|6}} in November.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM545&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield214&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1817|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the ''Prompte'' he moved into the 32-gun {{HMS|Andromeda|1784|6}} in 1795 and served on a number of stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM545&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield185&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1817|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first on the Scottish coast, and on 6 March 1796 seized the 36-gun [[Batavian Republic|Batavian]] frigate [[HMS Eurus (1796)|''Zefir'']] in the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]], in company with {{HMS|Kite|1795|6}} and {{HMS|Ranger|1794|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield185&quot;/&gt;{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} Taylor then took ''Andromeda'' to North America, sailing to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]] on 24 May 1796.&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB488&quot;/&gt; He returned to cruise in the [[English Channel]] and the [[North Sea]] between 1797 and 1798.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield185&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Admiral Sir Charles Hamilton (1767-1849), by William Beechey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Charles Hamilton, 2nd Baronet, of Trebinshun House|Sir Charles Hamilton]], c. 1800, by [[William Beechey|Sir William Beechey]]. Taylor served under Hamilton at the capture of [[Gorée]] in 1801.]]
Taylor was given command of the 48-gun {{HMS|Magnanime|1780|6}} in spring 1799, succeeding Captain [[Michael de Courcy|The Hon. Michael de Courcy]], and commanded her on African coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM545&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield89&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1817|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the capture of [[Gorée]] from the French in April 1801, while cruising with a squadron under the command of Captain [[Sir Charles Hamilton, 2nd Baronet, of Trebinshun House|Sir Charles Hamilton]]. Hamilton, in command of the 44-gun {{HMS|Melpomene|1794|6}} had received intelligence that there were three French frigates at anchor there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young433&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Young|title=A History of the late war between Great Britain and France|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton sailed to investigate, taking with him Taylor in ''Magnanime'', and Captain [[Solomon Ferris]], in command of the 64-gun {{HMS|Ruby|1776|6}}. The frigates were not there, so Hamilton summoned the governor and ordered him to surrender. The governor agreed, and Hamilton and his force took possession on 5 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young433&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norie134&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Norie|title=The Naval Gazetteer, Biographer, and Chronologist|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was later in the [[Leeward Islands]], where he remained for the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB450&quot;/&gt;

==Family and later life==
Taylor does not appear to have commanded any further ships during his career, but he continued to be promoted, being advanced to [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|rear-admiral]] on 1 August 1811, [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|vice-admiral]] on 12 August 1819 and [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|admiral]] in 1830.&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB488&quot;/&gt; He settled at [[Greenwich]] with his wife Isabella and had at least one daughter, Grace, who married William Padfield, squire of [[Hayling Island]], in 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM655&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine|The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Review]]|page=655|year=1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=042-wiltshire&amp;cid=-1#-1|title=The Records of the Wiltshire Family, Formerly of Hayling Manor, Hayling Island, Hants|accessdate=10 April 2013|publisher=The National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Taylor reached the rank of Admiral of the Red before his death on 19 July 1842 at his residence at [[Maze Hill]], Greenwich, at the age of 82.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM545&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AB450&quot;/&gt; He was by this time the last surviving officer from Cook's third voyage.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM545&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AB450&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR278&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Annual Register|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;
