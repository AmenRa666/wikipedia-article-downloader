== German Defenders of Gold Beach ==

As written, the article implies that the whole of the 716th Division defended the Gold beaches.  Wikipedia's own article on this Division states &quot;The 716th Division covered the Normandy coast north of Caen, from the mouth of the River Orne in the east to the Carentan Estuary in the west. As such the Division had elements present on Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword Beaches. An artillery regiment was stationed at the Merville Battery.&quot;

I believe that the article needs to point out that only part of this Division was actually committed to the defence of this area.  While I own a couple of books on DDay, one based on postwar interviews with German Officers actually serving in the campaign, these are in storage.  However, I have found one web source that indicates only 3 infantry companies were available - 7 Coy, 736 Grenadier Regt and 3 &amp; 4 Coys of 441 Ost Btn

http://www.6juin1944.com/assaut/gold/en_index.php

I would like some verification from another source before being so explicit in an article.

You will also note that the above source says that the other german unit was 1 Btn of 916 Regt, not 914 Regt as mentioned in this article. 916 Regt is also mentioned by another site:

http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/germandef.html

Is 914 just a mistype? Or is there some evidence to back it up?[[User:Glevum|Glevum]] ([[User talk:Glevum|talk]]) 04:07, 3 July 2012 (UTC)

== Les Roquettes ==

Wikipedia is embedded in the current internet and maps.Google.com is the most used site, so much so that it now appears at the top separate from the rest in the Wikipedia gephack page, yet it does not have ''Les Roquettes'' in its database. Indeed it finds ''five'' places named Les Roquettes in Normandy, but none of them could possibly have been &quot;09.30 – Les Roquettes is captured&quot; as the article says. The 'Les Roquettes'' I could find on maps, all lie from 10 to 30 miles from the beach. Could someone with real knowledge find the location of Les Roquettes in maps.Google.com and put a link to it in the article? Indeed ''all'' of the geographic milestones mentioned in the &quot;Timeline&quot; section of the article cannot be found anywhere on the internet. Only their names in text. Where is the map image that has these names? Thanks [[User:Nwbeeson|Nick Beeson]] ([[User talk:Nwbeeson|talk]]) 11:12, 7 June 2014 (UTC)

:There is possible confusion due to the British not necessarily using the full French form of the place names. The ''Les Roquettes'' you refer to is right on the coast to the east of and not far from [[Asnelles|Asnelles-sur-Mer]], as is the nearby Hamel, AKA Le Hamel.

== Naval and Air support at the beaches. ==

Perhaps a bit nitpicking but given the infobox inclusion for naval support at Omaha (and now Utah): the Free French cruiser Montcalm also supported Omaha (and may have been the first allied ship to open fire on Omaha), Canadian Minesweepers were (I believe) the first to come close inshore at Omaha, and Norwegian and Polish ships gave naval support in the British and Canadian sectors. These are just a few of the inconsistencies with the infobox inclusions/exclusions for the Normandy Invasion Beach articles. I am noting this here instead of editing because I realize the sensitivity of many folk to these issues. Why are these support issues recognized in some beach articles and not others? [[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 22:59, 14 July 2016 (UTC)
:The only one of the five that mentions the ships in the infobox is Omaha. I prepared list articles last year on all five bombardment groups so we do have sourced content available if there's consensus to add more details to the other infoboxes. [[:List of ships of Force U Bombardment Group]]; [[:List of ships in Omaha Bombardment Group]]; [[:List of ships in Bombarding Force K]]; [[:List of ships in Juno Bombardment Group]]; [[:List of ships in Sword Bombardment Group]]. — [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] ([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 01:28, 15 July 2016 (UTC)
::That is a good start. I only question the lack of consistency. Also a naval person (not being me) might question the lack in the articles of the naval efforts during the landings. [[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 16:15, 17 July 2016 (UTC)
:::PS. In my brief readings the minesweepers were also critical. E.g., in the American sectors this was I believe predominantly a Canadian force. [[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 16:18, 17 July 2016 (UTC)
::::@[[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]: Have made edits consistent with your bombardment group pages. We will see the response. [[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 17:59, 17 July 2016 (UTC)
