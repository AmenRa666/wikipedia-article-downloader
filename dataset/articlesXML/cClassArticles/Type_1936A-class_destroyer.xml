The '''Zerstörer 1936A'''-class destroyers, or '''Narvik-class destroyers''' as they were known to the Allies, were a class of [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[destroyer]]s of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. In common with other German destroyers launched after the start of World War II, the Narviks were unnamed, known only by their hull numbers - ''Z23'' to ''Z39''.

==Design==
In terms of armament, they were closer to light cruisers than the typical destroyer. The use of 15&amp;nbsp;cm (5.9&amp;nbsp;inch) guns was atypical of destroyers which tended to have guns around 120 – 127&amp;nbsp;mm (4.7 to 5&amp;nbsp;inch) in calibre. They were intended to carry two forward guns in a twin turret, but as the twin turrets were not ready in time, early class 1936As carried a single mounted gun forward.

Despite being powerful the ships were not without their flaws. There were problems with the reliability of the high pressure steam engines and seakeeping in rough seas due to the newly designed bow and heavy forward artillery.

The eight ships of the ''Zerstörer 1936A'' class (Z23 to Z30) were all laid down between 1938 and 1940. The seven destroyers numbered from Z31 to Z39 were classed as '''Zerstörer 1936A (Mob)'''; they were laid down in 1940 and 1941 and were slightly larger and had some internal modifications (including engines that caused less trouble than with their predecessors) from the original design to shorten construction times.

==Ships==
The class, including the 36A (Mob), consisted of 15 ships. All were built in [[Bremen]] by [[AG Weser]] shipyard (part of [[Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau AG]]/Deschimag) apart from Z37, Z38 and Z39 which were built by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germania]] (Kiel).
