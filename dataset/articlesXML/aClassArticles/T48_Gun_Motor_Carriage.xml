The '''T48 57&amp;nbsp;mm Gun Motor Carriage''' was a self-propelled anti-tank gun produced by the [[Diamond T]] company in 1943 for the [[United States]]. The design incorporated a [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|57 mm gun M1]], a US production of the [[Ordnance_QF_6-pounder|British Ordnance QF 6 pounder]], mounted on an [[M3 Half-track]].

A total of 962 vehicles were produced from 1942 to 1943. It had originally been planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through [[Lend-Lease]], intending to use them in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Western Desert]], but by the time they arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built [[M10 tank destroyer]], armed with a [[3-inch_Gun_M5|3-inch gun]] (and later a [[Ordnance_QF_17-pounder|17-pounder gun]] in British service) had begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the [[Soviet Union]] under the Soviet Aid Program. Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US; these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks, except for one kept by the U.S. Army.

The Soviets called it the '''SU-57''' (''[[Samokhodnaya ustanovka]] 57''), and under this designation it served in [[Operation Bagration]] and other fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] during World War II.

== Specifications ==
The T48 Gun Motor Carriage was {{convert|21|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|7|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} high. It had a [[wheelbase]] of {{convert|135.5|in|m|abbr=on}}, and weighed 9.45 tons (20,800&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=Berndt152&gt;Berndt (1993), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension consisted of a [[leaf spring]] for the wheels, while the front tread had [[Vertical volute spring suspension|vertical volute springs]]. The vehicle had a maximum speed of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. With a fuel capacity of 60 US gallons (230&amp;nbsp;l), it had a range of {{convert|150|mi|km}}, and was powered by a {{convert|128|hp|kW|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=Berndt34&gt;Berndt (1994), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; White 160AX, 386&amp;nbsp;in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (6,330&amp;nbsp;cc),&lt;ref name=Hogg94&gt;Hogg (1980), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; 6-cylinder [[petrol engine|gasoline]] engine with a [[compression ratio]] of 6:3:1. The power-to-weight ratio was 15.8&amp;nbsp;hp/ton. It also had 6–12&amp;nbsp;mm of armor,&lt;ref name=Berndt152 /&gt; and was armed with a single [[57 mm Gun M1]] with 99 rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://lonesentry.com/manuals/tm-9-2800-military-vehicles/t48-57mm-halftrack.html | title=TM 9-2800: Standard Military Motor Vehicles | publisher=United States War Department Technical Manual | origyear=1 September 1943 | date=2005 | accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a crew of five (commander, gunner, driver, loader, and radio operator).&lt;ref name=Doyle228&gt;Doyle (2013), pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:MWP BTR.JPG|thumb|left||T48 in the [[Polish Army Museum]]]]

The T48 originated from an Anglo-American requirement for a self-propelled 6-pounder anti-tank gun.&lt;ref name=Chamberlain191&gt;Chamberlain &amp; Ellis (1969), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The 57&amp;nbsp;mm 6-pounder gun was the latest British anti-tank gun at the time the T48 was designed.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt106 /&gt;}} The requirement was met by emplacing a 57&amp;nbsp;mm gun M1 – the U.S. production version of the British Ordnance QF 6-pounder – in the rear of an [[M3 Half-track]]. The first production batch was ordered in April 1942.&lt;ref name=Zaloga36 /&gt; The Americans dropped their requirements because of the design of another tank destroyer, the [[M10 tank destroyer|M10]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga (2012), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards it was intended solely to be supplied overseas under the terms of the [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease Program]]; the T48 was never officially type-classified.&lt;ref name=Zaloga36&gt;Zaloga (2004), pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pilot model ===
The pilot model was built at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in May 1942. The 57&amp;nbsp;mm Gun M1 was mounted in the M12 recoil mechanism and installed on a tubular pedestal. The tubular pedestal was soon replaced with a conical structure that was designated the &quot;57&amp;nbsp;mm gun mount T5&quot;. The gun on the pilot model had a [[Gun laying|traverse]] of 27.5 degrees either side of the centerline (total of 55 degrees), while having an elevation of +15 to -5 degrees. The short-barrelled (43 caliber) British Mark III 6-pounder gun was installed in the pilot, but the longer-barrelled (50 caliber) 57&amp;nbsp;mm Gun M1 was specified for the production models. The original travel lock – to hold the gun in a fixed position when the vehicle was moving – proved to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by a travel lock on the front hood.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt106 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M24&quot;&gt;Mesko (1996), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original design used a gun shield taken from the [[T44 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage]], but after the first tests were complete, a new shield was designed with 5/8 inch thick face-hardened steel on the front and 1/4 inch thick on the sides and top. The shield extended over the crew with a relatively low silhouette of only {{convert|90|in|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt106&gt;Hunnicutt (2001), pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; Experience with the [[M3 Gun Motor Carriage]] in the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–1942)|Philippines Campaign]], resulted in demountable headlights being used.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt98&gt;Hunnicutt (2001), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mesko (1996), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|During the Philippines Campaign it was found that the M3's headlights were damaged when its gun was fired. The deformation to the [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]] from the same cause also resulted in damage to the M3's engine and the transmission.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt109 /&gt;}} The T48 was accepted for production in 1942.&lt;ref name=Zaloga36 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M24&quot; /&gt;

== Service history ==
[[File:T48 (57mm Gun Motor Carriage T48) in Kubinka Tank Museum.JPG|thumb|A T48 in the [[Kubinka tank museum]].]]
Deliveries of the T48 were made in 1942 and 1943, with 50 arriving in 1942 followed by a further 912 in 1943. The British ordered all of the T48s that were produced, intending to use them in the [[Western Desert Campaign]]. By the time the vehicles arrived in the theater in the summer of 1943, the British had already won the war in the Western Desert. Meanwhile, the 57&amp;nbsp;mm gun was superseded by the 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun from the U.S., and later the availability of the [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun]], meant that the T48 became surplus to British requirements. As a result, the vehicles were almost immediately shipped to the Soviet Union under the terms of the Soviet Aid Program. Through this, the Soviets received 650 vehicles,&lt;ref name=Hogg94 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ness193 /&gt; which they designated the &quot;SU-57&quot; (''Samokhodnaya ustanovka 57''). A small number were later passed to the [[Polish People's Army]].&lt;ref name=Zaloga36 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kinard297&gt;Kinard (2007), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green214&gt;Green (2014), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the remainder, Britain accepted 30, all of which were converted back into carriers, and the US took 282 vehicles. Of those retained by the US, all but one were converted back to M3A1 standard carriers&lt;ref name=Doyle228 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ness193 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rottman30&gt;Rottman (2012), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1944.&lt;ref name=Ness193 /&gt; The conversion took place at the Chester Tank Depot.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt109&gt;Hunnicutt (2001), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' also operated a number of T48s as carriers, having captured several from Britain and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Zaloga36 /&gt;

The Soviets employed the T48 along the Eastern Front, mainly in [[Operation Bagration]]. The Soviet 16th Separate Tank Destroyer Brigade used a large number of T48s in 1943 during the offensive across the [[Dnieper River]], and with the 19th Brigade during the Baranow bridgehead battle in August 1944. The T48 also served with the Soviet 22nd Self-Propelled Artillery Brigade. Some of these units also took part in the Berlin and Prague offensives. The Polish People's Army used T48s assigned to the 7th Self-Propelled Artillery Battery to support Soviet attacks into Germany and Poland.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Zaloga (1994), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Soviet service, the vehicles were allocated to brigades at a scale of 60 per brigade. During the attack, the vehicles were used to provide mobile fire support, being placed behind the infantry, usually in a [[hull-down]] position behind a ridge or a hill, to fire across a broad front to take advantage of the long range of the 57&amp;nbsp;mm gun.&lt;ref name=Dunn85&gt;Dunn (1995), pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;
