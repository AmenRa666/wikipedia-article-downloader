'''Operation Sandblast''' was the code name for the first submerged circumnavigation of the world, executed by the [[United States Navy]] [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[radar picket]] [[submarine]] {{USS|Triton|SSRN-586}} in 1960 under the command of [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|Captain Edward L. Beach]].  The ''[[New York Times]]'' described ''Triton''{{'}}s submerged [[circumnavigation]] of the [[Earth]] as &quot;a triumph of human prowess and engineering skill, a feat which the United States Navy can rank as one of its bright victories in man's ultimate conquest of the seas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Modern&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= The Modern Magellans | url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40617FC345C16738DDDAA0994DD405B808AF1D3 | work= New York Times| date= May 13, 1960 | accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumnavigation took place between 24 February and 25 April 1960, covering {{convert|26,723|nmi|km mi}} over 60 days and 21 hours.  The route began and ended at the [[St. Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the [[Equator]].  During the voyage, ''Triton'' crossed the Equator four times while maintaining an average speed of {{convert|18|kn|km/h mph}}.  ''Triton''{{'}}s overall navigational track during Operation Sandblast generally followed that of the first circumnavigation of the world, led by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] from 1519 to 1522.

The initial impetus for Operation Sandblast was to increase American technological and scientific prestige before the May [[1960 Paris Summit]] between [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]].  It also provided a high-profile public demonstration of the capability of U.S. Navy [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarines]] to carry out long-range submerged operations independent of external support and undetected by hostile forces, presaging the initial deployment of the U.S Navy's [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] [[George Washington-class submarine|ballistic missile submarines]] later in 1960.  Finally, Operation Sandblast gathered extensive [[Oceanography|oceanographic]], [[Hydrography|hydrographic]], [[Gravimetry|gravimetric]], [[Geophysics|geophysical]], and [[Psychology|psychological]] data during ''Triton''{{'}}s circumnavigation.

Although official celebrations for Operation Sandblast were cancelled following the diplomatic furor arising from the [[1960 U-2 incident|shooting down of a CIA U-2 spy plane]] over the Soviet Union in early May 1960, the ''Triton'' did receive the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with a special clasp in the form of a golden replica of the globe in recognition of the successful completion of its mission, and Captain Beach received the [[Legion of Merit]] for his role as ''Triton''{{'}}s commanding officer.  In 1961, Beach received the [[Magellanic Premium]], the United States' oldest and most prestigious scientific award, from the [[American Philosophical Society]] in &quot;recognition of his navigation of the U.S. submarine ''Triton'' around the globe.&quot;

==Mission overview—Project Magellan==
{{Quotation|There is no doubt that sooner or later the USSR will put some nuclear submarine to sea.  It would be a shame if we permit them to announce this to the world by virtue of some dramatic feat which we could have done ourselves.  This could be [[Sputnik]] all over again, but without any excuses...  &quot;Project Magellan&quot; is, in my estimation, head and shoulders above any of the remainder as a feat of submarine navigation and a demonstration of the global range of nuclear submarines.&lt;ref name=Finch110&gt;{{cite book |title= Beneath the Waves: The Life and Navy of Capt.

===Mission origins===
The possibility of a submerged circumnavigation of the world by a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine was initially discussed between [[Captain (United States)#U.S. Navy.2C U.S. Coast Guard.2C U.S. Public Health Service.2C and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Captain]] [[Evan Peter Aurand|Evan P. Aurand]], President Eisenhower's naval aide, and [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[William Anderson (naval officer)|William R. Anderson]], commanding officer of the first nuclear submarine, [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|''Nautilus'']], before it was decided to attempt a [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)#Operation Sunshine - under the North Pole|submerged voyage]] under the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Ice Diaries: The Untold Story of the USS ''Nautilus'' and the Cold War's Most Daring Mission |last= Anderson |first= William R. |authorlink= William Anderson (naval officer) |author2=Don Keith |date= 2008 |publisher= [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson Publishers]] |location= [[Nashville, Tennessee]] |isbn= 978-0-7852-2759-5  |pages= 154–159 |url= http://www.donkeith.com/index.php?p=13  |accessdate=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Aurand is credited with recommending that a successful submerged circumnavigation, timed to conclude just prior to the upcoming [[1960 Paris Summit|May 1960 Four Power Paris Summit]] between [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Dwight D. Eisenhower and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] Nikita Khrushchev, would provide a much needed boost to American prestige, and consequently this voyage, [[Code name|code-named]] Operation Sandblast, reflected the highest priority within the Eisenhower administration.&lt;ref&gt;Beach.

''Beneath the Waves'', pp. 110, 230n29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Admiral Burke's classified response dated 18 January 1960 acknowledged the technical feasibility of Project Magellan while further noting that the &quot;Magellan route&quot; could be transited in &quot;56 days at {{convert|20|kn|km/h mph}} and 75 days at {{convert|15|kn|km/h mph}},&quot; with the latter option costing an additional $3.34 million USD in nuclear fuel consumed.&lt;ref&gt;Finch. ''Beneath the Waves'', pp. 110, 230n31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aurand forwarded his Project Magellan proposal and Burke's assessment to Press Secretary [[James C. Hagerty]] in a memorandum dated 26 January 1960.  Project Magellan was subsequently approved by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and USS ''Triton'' was specifically recommended by Aurand to undertake Project Magellan.&lt;ref&gt;Finch. ''Beneath the Waves'', pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Navy nuclear-powered [[radar picket]] submarine ''Triton'' (''pictured'') was the largest, most powerful, and most expensive [[Nuclear submarine|submarine]] ever built at the time of her commissioning, costing $109,000,000 excluding the cost of her nuclear fuel and reactors.&lt;ref name=Polmar67&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  A unique submarine, she also had the distinction of being the only non-Soviet submarine to be powered by two nuclear reactors.  ''Triton''{{'}}s  high speed was derived from her twin-reactor nuclear propulsion plant, with a designed speed, surfaced and submerged, of {{convert|28|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. On 27 September 1959, ''Triton'' achieved &quot;well in excess of&quot; {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} during her initial sea trials.&lt;ref name=Polmar67/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Largess and Horwitz. &quot;USS ''Triton'': The Ultimate Submersible,&quot; p. 178, 180&lt;/ref&gt;  As originally designed, ''Triton''{{'}}s total reactor output was rated at {{convert|34000|hp}}, but she achieved {{convert|45000|hp}} during her sea trials ''(pictured)'', and her first commanding officer believed ''Triton''{{'}}s plant could have reached {{convert|60000|hp}} &quot;had that been necessary.&quot;&lt;ref name=Polmar67/&gt;

''Triton''{{'}}s first commanding officer was [[Captain (U.S. Navy)#U.S. Navy|Captain]] [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.]] (''pictured''), a highly decorated submarine officer who had participated in the [[Battle of Midway]] and 12 combat patrols during [[World War II]], earning 10 decorations for gallantry, including the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].  After the war, Beach served as the naval aide to the [[President of the United States]] from 1953 to 1957, and he also was the best-selling author of the non-fiction book ''Submarine!'' and a [[Run Silent, Run Deep#Novel plot|novel ''Run Silent, Run Deep'']], which was made into a [[Run Silent, Run Deep#Movie plot|1958 movie]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Edward L Beach.&quot; [[Current Biography|''Current Biography'' (1960)]], p. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his last interview prior to his death in 2002, Captain Beach recalled  ''Triton'' and the background to her historical mission:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As I was reporting to the ''Triton'', I remember saying, &quot;This ship is an unusual one. We've got to do something special with it. What could it be?&quot; We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If you take a look at a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go.  So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.&lt;ref name=WellAroundtheWorld&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schultz |first= Fred |authorlink= |date=February 2003 |title= We'll Go Around the World: An Interview with Captain Edward L.

Following her commissioning on 10 November 1959, ''Triton''  was assigned to [[Submarine Squadron]] 10 (Subron 10), the U.S. Navy's first all-nuclear force, based at the [[Naval Submarine Base New London|U.S. Submarine Base in New London]], [[Connecticut]], under the command of [[Commodore (USN)#Present day title usage|Commodore]] Thomas H. Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the Word Submerged'', p. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Triton'' subsequently completed torpedo trials at [[Naval Station Newport]] and conducted other special tests at the [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk Navy Base]] before returning to [[General Dynamics Electric Boat|Electric Boat]] on 7 December 1959 in order to install special communications equipment, including a prototype of the BRA-3 towed communications buoy system housed in a large fairing located on the after end of the main deck.&lt;ref name=Beach16&gt;Beach.

On 20 January 1960, ''Triton'' got underway to conduct an accelerated series of at-sea testing.  ''Triton'' returned on 1 February as preparations continued for her forthcoming [[shakedown cruise]], scheduled for departure on 16 February 1960, which involved operating with the [[command ship]] {{USS|Northampton|CLC-1|2}}, [[flagship]] of the [[U.S. Second Fleet]], in northern European waters.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the Word Submerged'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 February, Captain Beach received a message from Rear Admiral [[Lawrence R. Daspit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Silent Victory: The U.S. Submarine War Against Japan |last= Blair |first= Clay |authorlink= Clay Blair |date= 2008 |publisher= [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location= [[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn= 978-1-55750-217-9  |page= 1037 |url= http://www.usni.org/store/books/history/silent-victory  |accessdate=2011-01-19|quote=Quality paperback edition, hereafter referred to as Blair}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ComSubLant|Commander Submarines Atlantic Fleet (&lt;small&gt;COMSUBLANT&lt;/small&gt;)]], instructing Beach to attend a top secret meeting at [[The Pentagon]] on 4 February.&lt;ref name=FirstB5&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the Word Submerged'', pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission objectives===
On 4 February 1960, Captain Edward L. Beach and Commodore Thomas H. Henry of Subron 10 arrived at [[the Pentagon]] in civilian attire to attend a top-secret, high-level meeting led by [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] Wallace M. Beakley, Deputy [[Chief of Naval Operations]] for Fleet Operations and Readiness.  Also attending were [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Lawson P. Ramage]], Director of the Undersea Warfare Division, OPNAV; Captain [[Henry G. Munson]], Director of the [[Hydrographic office#United States|U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office]], and staff representatives from the submarine [[U.S. Navy type commands|type commands]] for the [[ComSubLant|Atlantic]] and [[ComSubPac|Pacific]] fleets.&lt;ref name=FirstB5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Papers of Vice Admiral Wallace M. Beakley | url= http://www.history.navy.mil/ar/bravo/beakley.htm | work= Operational Archives Branch | publisher= [[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]] | date= 1940–1964 | accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was announced ''Triton''{{'}}s upcoming shakedown cruise was to be a submerged world circumnavigation, code-named Operation Sandblast, which would generally follow the track of the first [[Ferdinand Magellan#Voyage of circumnavigation|circumnavigation in 1519–1522 led by Ferdinand Magellan]]. ''Triton'' would depart as scheduled on 16 February, and the submarine would arrive back home no later than 10 May 1960.  The mission objectives for Operation Sandblast were summarized below:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For purposes of geophysical and oceanographic research and to determine habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris program]] – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.&lt;ref name=FirstB5/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Captain Beach, the Navy came up with the [[code name]] of ''Sandblast'' because it was judged that taking his ship around the world submerged would &quot;take a lot of sand&quot; on the crew's part to be successful.  Also, ''Sand'' served as Beach's personal code name during the mission.  As the captain noted:  &quot;Most beaches are full of sand, I was informed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finch. ''Beneath the Waves'', pp. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission preparations===
[[File:USS Triton Loadingfood.jpg|thumb|right|Loading ship's stores|alt=U.S. Navy enlisted man lifting a bag of potatoes surrounded with other bag and cases of food in a submarine torpedo room.]]
Beach and Henry arrived back in New London at 5:45&amp;nbsp;A.M. on 5 February. Later that morning, after breakfast, Beach briefed his officers, whom Beach had insisted needed to know, about their new shakedown orders and the mission objectives for Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref name=WellAroundtheWorld/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-5 to B-6, B-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach. pp. 50&quot;&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. ix–x, Chapter 3, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The officers and crew of ''Triton'' had just 12 days to complete preparations for their much more ambitious, but top secret, shakedown cruise. With the exception of Chief Quartermaster (QMC) William J. Marshall, the enlisted personnel did not initially know the true nature of their upcoming mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach. p. 50&quot;&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  A cover story was devised that, following the shakedown cruise, ''Triton'' would proceed to the [[Caribbean Sea]] to undergo additional testing required by BuShips. The crew and civilian personnel were also instructed to file their [[Income tax in the United States|federal income taxes]] early and take care of all other personal finances that might arise through mid-May.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-5 to B-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 47–48, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lt. Commander]] Will M. Adams, ''Triton''{{'}}s [[executive officer]], and Lt. Commander Robert W. Bulmer, her operations officer, along with Chief Quartermaster Marshall, prepared the precise, mile-by-mile track of their upcoming voyage in the secure chart room, located at &lt;small&gt;COMSUBLANT&lt;/small&gt; headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach. p. 50&quot;/&gt;  Lt. Commander Robert D. Fisher, ''Triton''{{'}}s supply officer, coordinated loading of stores sufficient for a 120-day voyage ''(pictured)''. Eventually, some {{convert|77613|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of food were loaded on board, including {{convert|16487|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of frozen food, {{convert|6631|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of canned meat, {{convert|1300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of coffee, and {{convert|1285|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vice Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]], the head of the [[Naval Reactors|U.S. Navy's Naval Reactors branch]], sent special power-setting instructions for ''Triton''{{'}}s reactors, allowing them to operate with greater flexibility and a higher safety factor.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key personnel change occurred on 2 February when ''Triton''{{'}}s veteran chief engineering officer, Lt. Commander Leslie D. Kelly, left for duty at the Rickover's Naval Reactors branch of the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]]. His relief was his former assistant engineering officer, Lt. Commander Donald G. Fears.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, B-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. ix–x, Chapter 3, pp. 44, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a number of [[Supercargo|supercargo personnel]] joined ''Triton'' for her shakedown cruise, with none aware of the top-secret nature of Operation Sandblast.  Joseph Baynor Roberts was a well-known [[photographer]] from the [[National Geographic Magazine|''National Geographic'' Magazine]], and as a Commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve, he was recalled to active duty to serve as the [[press pool]] for the voyage with the [[Public affairs (military)|U.S. Navy Office of Information]].

''Triton'' departed New London on 16 February 1960 for what was announced as her shakedown cruise ''(pictured)''.  ''Triton'' set course to the south-east (134 degrees true).&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-7.&lt;/ref&gt; At dawn on 17 February, ''Triton'' performed her first morning star-sighting using the built-in [[sextant]] in her No. 1 periscope during the nightly ventilation of the shipboard atmosphere. The inboard induction valve was closed after the removal of a rusted flashlight that had prevented its closure.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-7 to B-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 84–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Beach announced the true nature of their shakedown cruise ''(pictured)'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Men, I know you’ve all been waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I can tell you that we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the Word Submerged'', pp. 89-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the upcoming voyage, Beach adopted a decidedly non-traditional command style:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Early on, I realized that what this particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch.  Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction.  Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications was not a problem — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be.  My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us.  It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up.  This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Weybrew. ''The ABC's of Stress''. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the shakedown cruise, Beach adopted a specific weekly shipboard routine.  Mondays and Tuesdays involved regular activities, with drills, lectures, school of the ship, and class programs from the noon to 1600 watch.  Wednesdays had the crew on reduced activities that is traditionally known as Rope Yarn Sunday.  Thursdays saw a schedule of regular drills, and Fridays involved up keep and general maintenance activities known as Field Day.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saturdays had regular activities with afternoon drills, and Sundays had reduced activities with normal watches and religious observances.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, beginning on 17 February during the [[Watchstanding|mid watch]], ''Triton'' came to periscope depth to take a nightly fix using the built-in sextant in her celestial periscope, ventilate and replenish her shipboard atmosphere using the [[submarine snorkel|snorkel]], and dispose of any shipboard garbage.  Since ''Triton'' did not have a generator to extract oxygen from sea water, these nightly snorkeling activities were crucial to maintaining a suitable atmosphere.

Later that same day, 17 February 1960, ''Triton'' experienced a serious leak with a main condenser circulating water pump, and a reactor warning alarm tripped because of a defective electrical connection. Both incidents were handled successfully and did not affect the ship's performance.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 93–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 February ''Triton'' conducted her first general daily drill and on 19 February released her first twice-daily hydrographic bottles, used to study ocean current patterns.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-9 to B-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also on 19 February, shipboard sensors detected a radiation leak.  It was subsequently determined the [[radium]] dials on three wristwatches were the cause for the alarm, and once removed, no radiation was detected for the balance of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Hadley | first= William | title= Nuclear power's danger exaggerated | url= http://www.yumasun.com/opinion/power-55822-nuclear-radiation.html | date= January 28, 2010 | work= Letters to the editor | publisher= [[Yuma Sun]] | accessdate=2010-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 February, ''Triton'' detected a previously uncharted [[seamount]] with her [[fathometer]].&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation, p. B-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beach maintained that the greatest challenge facing the crew was a seeming mundane activity, garbage disposal and cleaning: &quot;It was 84 days of strenuous work just keeping the ship clean. It was amazing how much dirt we created, so I had a field day every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object.&quot;  To remove trash without surfacing, ''Triton'' had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through the bottom of the ship.  However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.&lt;ref name=WellAroundtheWorld/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-10 to B-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 94–96; 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February, ''Triton'' made her first landfall, reaching [[St. Peter and Paul Rocks]] ''(pictured)'' after traveling {{convert|3250|nmi|km mi}}. The Rocks served as the home plate for ''Triton''{{'}}s submerged circumnavigation. Photographic reconnaissance was carried out by Lt. Richard M. Harris, the CIC/ECM officer, and Chief Cryptologic Technician (CTC) William R. Hadley, who served as the ship's secondary photo-recon team for the voyage.  ''Triton'' turned south and crossed the [[equator]] for the first time later that day, passing into the [[Southern Hemisphere]], with ship's personnel participating in the [[Line-crossing ceremony|crossing the line ceremony]] ''(pictured)''.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-16 to B-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 102–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destination: Cape Horn===

Beach dressed in khaki uniform and ceremonial sword; Chief Loyd Garlock dressed as King Neptune, Ruler of the Raging Main; crewman Ross MacGregor dressed as Davy Jones in background; and crewman Harry Olsen dressed as the Royal Baby.]]
On 1 March 1960, as ''Triton'' passed along the east coast of South America, a trio of crises threatened to end Operation Sandblast prematurely. The first was when Chief Radarman (RDC) John R. Poole began suffering from a series of [[kidney stone]]s.  The second was when the ship's fathometer went out of commission, with its loss meaning ''Triton'' could no longer echo-sound the sea floor, increasing the danger of grounding or collision as the ship traveled through poorly charted waters.  Captain Beach observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fortunately at the present time we are in an area where the water is deeper than normal for the Atlantic and for a number of hours there is [no] worry about unexpectedly scraping the top of any unsuspected submerged peak.  But we will want that fathometer badly as we approach Cape Horn.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps most critically, the third problem involved the readings on one of the reactors indicating a serious malfunction which required its shutdown. As Captain Beach noted, &quot;So far as ''Triton'' and the first of March were concerned, it seemed that troubles were not confined to pairs. On that day we were to have them in threes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that day, Lt. Milton R. Rubb and his electronics technician team returned the fathometer to operational status, and the Chief Engineer Donald D. Fears, Reactor Officer Lt. Cmdr. Robert P. McDonald, and ''Triton''{{'}}s engineering crew repaired the malfunctioning reactor. Since Poole's symptoms were intermittent, ''Triton'' continued south, although there was a detour to the [[Golfo Nuevo]] region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact. Contemporary news accounts reported the [[Argentine Navy]] had been encountering numerous unknown submarine contacts in the Golfo Nuevo during early 1960, but ''Triton''{{'}}s contact turned out to be a school of fish.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-22 to B-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach. p. 116-140&quot;&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 116–140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939605,00.html |title= ARGENTINA: The Ping in Golfo Nuevo |accessdate=2008-09-13 |work= [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']] |publisher= [[Time Inc.]] |date= - 22 February 1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March, ''Triton'' located the [[Falkland Islands]] on her radar and prepared to conduct [[photoreconnaissance]] of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley Harbor]]. Before they could visually sight the islands, Poole's condition worsened so much that–taking a calculated risk–Captain Beach reversed course, ordered [[flank speed]], and sent a radio message to headquarters describing the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach. p. 116-140&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-24 to B-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  From the ship's log on that date, Beach noted:
[[File:Capehorn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cape Horn]] (7 March 1960)|alt=Capt Horn as seen from the periscope of the nuclear submarine USS ''Triton'' is a rugged, jagged-edge mountainous rock formation rising above heavy sea swells under a stormy sky.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the control and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, carrying out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands are aware of the decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are relieved that they did not have to make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.&lt;ref&gt;''First Submerged Circumnavigation'' 1960, p. B-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fortunately, the [[Baltimore class cruiser|heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Macon|CA-132|2}}, with Captain Reuben T. Whitaker in command, had been on a good-will cruise to South American ports since January as the flagship for Rear Admiral Edward C. Stephan, Commander Naval Forces South Atlantic (Task Force 138).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Macon | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m1/macon.htm | accessdate = 2010-02-24 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5hPuXmOeF | archivedate = 2009-06-09| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-24 to B-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Macon'' had been in Argentine waters in conjunction with US President Eisenhower's visit to Argentina from 26–29 February 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/prestravels/ptravel2.html#eisenhower |title= Dwight D. Eisenhower |accessdate=2008-09-03 |work= Presidential Visits Abroad |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date= January 20, 1953 – January 20, 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early hours of 5 March, ''Triton'' rendezvoused with ''Macon'' off [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, after a diversion of over {{convert|2000|nmi|km mi}}. ''Triton'' broached, exposing only her [[Sail (submarine)|sail]]. A boat-handling party led by Lieutenant George A. Sawyer, the ship's gunnery officer, transferred Poole to the waiting whaleboat, which then returned to ''Macon''. Poole was the only crew member who did not complete the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;''First Submerged Circumnavigation'' 1960, pp. B-26 to B-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 142–158.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Radarman Poole was subsequently examined by both the doctors aboard ''Macon'' and at a hospital in Montevideo, but his third attack of kidney stones, which prompted his transfer off ''Triton'', proved to be his last–and he did not require kidney surgery.&lt;ref name=Beach291&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged,'' p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rendezvous, ''Triton'' dove and turned back southwards. She subsequently passed west of the Falklands, and rounded Cape Horn ''(pictured)'' through [[Estrecho de le Maire]] ([[Drake Passage]]) on 7 March. Captain Beach described his first impressions of this legendary lands-end of the Western Hemisphere as &quot;bold and forbidding, like the sway-backed profile of some prehistoric sea monster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beach |first=Edward L. |authorlink=|date=November 1960 |title=''Triton'' Follows Magellan's Wake |journal=[[National Geographic Society|''National Geographic'']] |volume=118 |issue=5 |page=593 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Beach allowed all the crew an opportunity to view Cape Horn through the ship's periscope, requiring five reverses of ''Triton''{{'}}s course to keep the cape in sight.&lt;ref&gt;''First Submerged Circumnavigation'' 1960, pp. B-30 to B-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 159–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Across the Pacific===

On 7 March, ''Triton'' entered the [[Pacific Ocean]] and passed into the operational control of Rear Admiral [[Roy S. Benson]],&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 1011.&lt;/ref&gt; Commander Submarine Force U.S. Pacific Fleet (&lt;small&gt;COMSUBPAC&lt;/small&gt;), who had been Captain Beach's commanding officer while he served on the [[Gato class submarine|fleet submarine]] {{USS|Trigger|SS-237|3}} in the [[Pacific War]]. ''Triton''{{'}}s first Pacific visual landfall was [[Easter Island]], some {{convert|2500|nmi|km mi}} away.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-30 to B-31, B-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March, ''Triton'' detected a [[seamount]], registering a minimum depth of {{convert|350|fathom|m ft}}, with a total height of {{convert|7000|ft|m}} above the ocean floor. Also on that day, ''Triton'' successfully conducted a drill simulating the emergency shutdown of both her reactors and loss of all power.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-31 to B-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 163–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, the starboard propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged to contain the leak.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 171–175.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's [[Submarine hull#Pressure hull|pressure hull]], it could not be repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, ''Triton'' could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the ''Triton''{{'}}s fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from ''Triton''{{'}}s high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.&lt;ref name=Beach291/&gt;

An alternative to the fathometer was devised involving the use of the ship's active forward search sonar in conjunction with the gravity meter installed in the combat intelligence center (CIC). By using both systems in tandem, underwater masses could be detected and avoided, although this approach lacked the capability of the fathometer to echo-sound the depth of the ocean floor.&lt;ref name=Beach17579&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 175–179.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 13 March, ''Triton'' detected a submerged peak using active sonar and the gravity meter that confirmed the feasibility of this procedure.&lt;ref name=Beach17579/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Triton'' next spotted [[Easter Island]] on that same day, 13 March 1960, first by radar, then by periscope. The northeastern coast of the island was photographed for two and a half hours before the statue that [[Thor Heyerdahl]] had erected was spotted. The entire crew was invited to observe through the periscope before the ''Triton'' departed for her next visual landfall–[[Guam]], some {{convert|6734|nmi|km mi}} distant.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-33 to B-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

A malfunctioning air compressor was repaired on 17 March.  The repair required the complete re-wiring of the compressor's armature, a task ordinarily done aboard a [[submarine tender]] or in a shipyard. Captain Beach was deeply impressed by &quot;this spirit and outlook [that] permeated our crew.&quot;  He was also &quot;astonished&quot; by two different makeshift fathometer sound transmitters created by the electronics and engineering crewmen. One was based on a general announcing speaker, while the other used a stainless steel cooking pot from the galley, with stainless steel rods and copper wiring. Beach noted in the ship's log: &quot;I could only marvel at the ingenuity of the American sailor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 182–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carbullido Beach Guam Triton 1960.jpg|thumb|right|Petty Officer Edward Carbullido (left) and Captain Beach, off Guam (28 March 1960)|alt=Two men, Petty Officer Edward Carbullido and Captain Edward L. Beach (left to right), standing next to the periscope in the conning tower compartment of the nuclear submarine USS ''Triton'']]

On 19 March, ''Triton'' detected another submerged peak, using its sonar and gravity meter, and crossed the equator a second time–passing into the [[Northern Hemisphere]] again. Another submerged peak was successfully detected on 20 March.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-35 to B-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that day, ''Triton'' made her closest approach to [[Pearl Harbor]], and the crew celebrated with a [[luau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beach18788&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton'' crossed the [[International Date Line]] on 23 March, losing 24 March from her calendar. The next day, sonar indicated another rise from the ocean floor, previously uncharted, logged with a depth of {{convert|350|fathom|m ft}}.&lt;ref name=Beach18788/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, 27 March, ''Triton'' passed the point of closest approach to the location where [[USS Triton (SS-201)|her namesake]] was lost during [[World War II]], and a memorial service was held to commemorate the occasion. A submerged [[Salute#Naval cannon fire|naval gun salute]] was fired to honor the lost crew when three water slugs were shot in quick succession from the forward torpedo tubes.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-39 to B-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 28 March, ''Triton'' spotted Guam and observed activity on shore via her periscope. Petty Officer Edward Carbullido ''(pictured)'', who had been born on Guam but had not returned home for 14 years, was asked to identify his parents' house through the periscope while the boat remained submerged in Agat Bay. ''Triton'' then changed course for the [[Philippines]], the midpoint of her around-the-world voyage.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-40 to B-B-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 195-201.&lt;/ref&gt; Carbullido was subsequently able to go home to Guam for [[Christmas Day]] 1960 on a 60-day leave, with the cost of his flight paid for by selling a magazine article on ''Triton''{{'}}s circumnavigation written by Captain Beach, and with the assistance of [[Pan American Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged,'' pp. 201, 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Philippines===
On 31 March, ''Triton'' crossed over the [[Philippine Trench]] and began threading her way through the vast [[Philippines|Philippine archipelago]], passing from the [[Philippine Sea]] through the [[Surigao Strait]] and then the [[Mindanao Sea]], and finally through the [[Bohol Strait]] into the [[Camotes Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special water sample was taken during ''Triton''{{'}}s transit of Surigao Strait; its recipient was the retired Vice Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf]], the task force commander whose battleships had defeated the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Southern Force]] during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The Battle of Surigao Strait .2825 October.29|Battle of Surigao Strait]], history's last naval battle fought only by surface warships, during World War II. Captain Beach observed, &quot;We think that Admiral Oldendorf will appreciate a sample of this body of water.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-45 to B-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April, ''Triton'' spotted [[Mactan Island]], and shortly before noon, sighted the [[Magellan shrine|monument]] (''pictured'') commemorating the death of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] at that site, thereby reaching the midpoint of her circumnavigation.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-46 to B-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 205–217.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Ordinarily a leader given to the most meticulous preparations for any important undertaking, one who personally checked every item and left no stone unturned in his effort to eliminate any possible cause of failure, Magellan's every action during this entire episode ... might almost have been calculated with the intention of seeking defeat. Such was the height of his religious fervor that divine intervention was expected as a matter of course. God, having brought him this far, would not forsake him now. So much have thought Magellan in the height of his exaltation, forgetting entirely that God is not bound by the conventions of man's thought.|Captain Edward L. Beach on Magellan and his demise|&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later that same day, [[April Fool's Day]], ''Triton'' was sighted by the only unauthorized person to spot the submarine during her top secret voyage–a young Filipino man in a small dugout canoe (''pictured'') about {{convert|50|yd|m}} off ''Triton''’s beam, staring at her raised periscope. Captain Beach later recorded his reactions to this unexpected encounter in his log:

{{quote|It is a ludicrous situation: On one hand an impassive Asian, staring with curious concentration at an unusual object in the water; on the other, a U.S. Navy officer, equipped with all technical devices money and science can procure, looking back with equally studied concentration. On one end of the periscope, an outrigger canoe propelled by the brawny arms of its builder; on the other end, a $100,000,000 submarine, the newest, biggest, most powerful in the world, on a history-making voyage.

The noted photographer Joseph Baynor Roberts of ''National Geographic'' magazine was able to snap several photos of this unexpected interloper ''(pictured)'' through the ship's periscope before ''Triton'' moved out of range. The November 1960 issue identified the fisherman as 19-year-old Rufino Baring of [[Mactan Island|Punta Engano, Mactan Island]], who believed he had encountered a sea monster: &quot;I was very frightened. I tried to get away as fast as I could.&quot;&lt;ref name=LanceStar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tricity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beach |first=Edward L. |authorlink=|date=November 1960 |title=''Triton'' Follows Magellan's Wake |journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=585–615 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Terrified fisherman thought ''Triton'' a sea monster,&quot; ''National Geographic Magazine'' (November 1960) p. 602&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged,'' pp. 291–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on the afternoon of 1 April, ''Triton'' proceeded through [[Hilutangan Channel]] into the [[Sulu Sea]] ''via'' [[Bohol Strait]].&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-50 to B-57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 217–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April, ''Triton''{{'}}s [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]] [[repeater]]s, used to maintain the ship's [[Bearing (navigation)|navigational bearing]], began to experience sudden, severe [[oscillation]]s, possibly caused by a malfunctioning [[synchro]] [[Servomechanism|amplifier]].  The helm was shifted to direct gyro input, the synchro amplifiers were checked out, and the gyroscopic repeaters appeared to return to normal function.  Later, while transiting the Pearl Bank Passage, a narrow channel lined with [[coral reefs]], a periscope observation determined that ''Triton'' was off course, indicating a potentially hazardous helm error.  Steering control was immediately shifted to the control room, with the helm using the master gyroscopic repeater. While the malfunction was detected in time and the ship was not in any immediate danger, the loss of navigational bearing could have been catastrophic, with Captain Beach noting that &quot;the episode had a sobering effect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-57 to B-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 221–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton''  then proceeded through the [[Sibutu Passage]] into the [[Celebes Sea]], leaving Philippine waters, and subsequently entered [[Makassar Strait]], crossing the equator a third time, on 3 April, and then, during 4 April, transited the [[Flores Sea]], bound for Lombok Strait, the gateway to the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-59 to B-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 225–227.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Ocean===
On 5 April, ''Triton'' entered the [[Indian Ocean]] via the [[Lombok Strait]]. The transition proved dramatic. The change in [[salinity]] and density of the seawater caused her to dive abruptly from periscope depth to {{convert|125|ft|m}} in about 40&amp;nbsp;seconds. Captain Beach noted, &quot;I had experienced changes in water density many times before, but never one of this magnitude.&quot; ''Triton'' returned to periscope depth and subsequently entered the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-60 to B-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 227–232.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Operation Sandblast Navigators.JPG|thumb|right|''Triton''{{'}}s navigators|alt=Three naval officer plotting the submerged course of the nuclear submarine ''Triton'', with Captain Beach seated before chart in the center, with Lt. Commander Will M. Adams standing at right holding a pair of dividers and Lt. Commander Robert W. Bulmer standign at the left holding a pencil, and an unidentified individual seated in the background.]]
While crossing the Indian Ocean, ''Triton'' conducted a sealed-ship experiment. Beginning 10 April, rather than refreshing the air in the ship by snorkeling each night, she remained sealed, using compressed air to make up for consumed [[oxygen]], as well as burning &quot;[[oxygen candle]]s&quot; to replenish the ship's atmosphere. Also, starting on 15 April, the smoking lamp was extinguished, with no [[tobacco smoking]] permitted anywhere aboard the ship.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-64 to B-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 233–244, 249–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this smoking ban, Dr. Benjamin Weybrew carried out a battery of tests on crew volunteers, both smokers and non-smokers, to measure cardiovascular functions and psychological stress indices to determine the effects that the prohibition of tobacco had on individual and group performance of the test subjects.  The objective of this experiment was to determine the advisability of prohibiting the use of tobacco from submarine operations given the extended submerged duration of missions involving nuclear-powered submarines.&lt;ref&gt;Weybrew. ''The ABC's of Stress''. pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The test results determined that smokers showed consistently higher mean oral temperature and [[Pulse|pulse rate]], both at rest and following exercises, as well as significantly increased pulse rates over non-smokers, a marked decrease in alertness, and an increase in [[Insomnia|insomnia symptoms]].  However, there was no significant difference in [[blood pressure]] between smokers and non-smokers.  Finally, smokers experienced &quot;debilitative performance decrements&quot; during the smoking prohibition, and as a consequence, this also affected the morale of non-smokers, both among the participants in the experiment as well as non-participants.  Dr. Weybrew concluded smoking should be avoided because of its attendant health and relational issues, and not smoking enhances one's overall stress coping capacity (SCC).&lt;ref&gt;Weybrew. ''The ABC's of Stress''. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web | author= David Collins | title= A 1960 submarine smoking ban lasted just three days | url= http://www.theday.com/article/20100416/NWS05/304169857 | publisher= [[The Day (New London)|The Day]] | date= April 16, 2010 | accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1963 convention of the Cigar Institute of America, Weybrew noted : &quot;When a smoker is forbidden to smoke he just doesn't like it.  The smokers in the test got irritable, ate too much, had trouble sleeping, and personal relationships began to deteriorate.&quot;&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;It took nearly another half-century for the Navy to ban smoking aboard subs. On 8 April 2010, the U.S. Navy announced a permanent smoking ban onboard submarines effective 31 December 2010.{{cite web | author= Lance M. Bacon | title= SubFor: Smoking on subs to end by Dec. 31 | url= http://www.navytimes.com/news/2010/04/navy_sub_smoking_ban_040810w/ | work= Navy Times | date= April 10, 2010 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Easter]] Sunday, 17 April, ''Triton'' sighted the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and subsequently re-entered the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], returning to the command authority of Rear Admiral Lawrence R. Daspit (&lt;small&gt;COMSUBLANT&lt;/small&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-68 to B-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 244-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The return to the St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks===
[[File:Surfacing off Cadiz USS Triton 1960.jpg|thumb|right|Off Cadiz, Spain (2 May 1960)|alt=Port side view of the sail and forward deck of the nuclear submarine ''Triton'' breaking the surface of the ocean near Cadiz, Spain, with hull number 586 visible on its sail.]]

The smoking lamp was re-lit on 18 April, with the three days of prohibition having taken a noticeable toll on crew morale.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than passing the word in a traditional manner, Captain Beach demonstrated the lifting of the ban by walking though the ship smoking a [[cigar]], blowing smoke in people's faces, and asking, &quot;Don't you wish you could do this?&quot; He recorded in his log that &quot;it took some 37&amp;nbsp;seconds for the word to get around.&quot;  On 20 April 1960, the ''Triton'' crossed the [[Prime Meridian]], and on 24 April, the sealed atmosphere experiment was terminated.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-60 to B-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 247–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day that the sealed atmosphere experiment was terminated, 24 April 1960, ''Triton'' experienced a major equipment failure.  In the after torpedo room, a hydraulic line to the stern plane mechanism burst.  Through the prompt action by Torpedoman's Mate Third Class Allen W. Steele, aided by Engineman Third Class Arlan F. Martin, this potentially catastrophic event was successfully contained. Eventually, the main hydraulic system was restored with a control valve from the steering system, but the boat's steering controls remained on emergency mode for the rest of the voyage. It was subsequently determined that the pipe burst was caused by a fractured valve.  For his quick and decisive actions in handling this emergency, Steele was presented the [[Commendation Ribbon|Navy Commendation Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;72-73&quot;&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-72 to B-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 254-257, 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April, ''Triton'' crossed the Equator a final time, re-entering the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and shortly thereafter, she sighted the [[St. Peter and Paul Rocks]], completing the first submerged [[circumnavigation]]. As Captain Beach wrote, &quot;We are not yet home, but we may be considered to have taken a long lead off third base.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;72-73&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 257–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeward bound===

During 28–29 April, ''Triton'' conducted engineering drills, then proceeded to [[Tenerife]], the [[Canary Islands]], arriving on 30 April, and thereafter setting course for [[Cadiz]], Spain, to complete two additional goals of Operation Sandblast. One was to honor the seaport where Ferdinand Magellan set sail from in 1519 to initiate the first global maritime circumnavigation, and the other was to deliver a plaque created to honor Magellan's and ''Triton''{{'}}s historic voyages when ''Triton'' rendezvoused with the destroyer {{USS|John W. Weeks|DD-701|2}} off Cadiz on 2 May 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach. pp. 263&quot;&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 263–267, 290.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterward, Beach noted, &quot;We are on the last leg of our trip enroute to the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-76 to B-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 260–268.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton'' returned to the United States, surfacing off the coast of [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]], on 10 May 1960. Captain Beach was flown by helicopter (''pictured'') to Washington, D.C., where news of the ''Triton''{{'}}s submerged around-the-world voyage was announced by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]  at the White House, with Vice Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, known as the &quot;Father of the Nuclear Navy&quot;, in attendance. Beach flew back to his boat later that day, and the ''Triton'' arrived back at Groton, Connecticut, on 11 May 1960, completing her shakedown cruise and the first submarine circumnavigation of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Beach.

==Mission accomplishments==
{{Quotation|''Triton''{{'}}s globe-girdling cruise proved invaluable to the United States. Politically, it enhanced the nation's prestige. From an operational viewpoint, the cruise demonstrated the great submerged endurance and sustained high-speed transit capabilities of the first generation of nuclear-powered submarines. Moreover, during the voyage, the submarine collected reams of oceanographic data.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Triton | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/triton-v.htm | accessdate = 2010-02-24|link=off}}&lt;/ref&gt;|''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''}}

Thamm, ''Triton''{{'}}s diving officer during Operation Sandblast, confirmed the actual duration of ''Triton''{{'}}s submerged circumnavigation was 60 days, 21 hours while further noting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Cable &amp; Wireless Adventurer'' did not beat ''Triton''{{'}}s record if it took them 75 days to circumnavigate the earth.  And if their route was 4752 statute miles (7647.6&amp;nbsp;km) shorter than ours, they simply aren't even close.&quot;&lt;ref name=Posiedon15/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Tully made inquiries regarding inconsistencies pertaining to the fastest motorized maritime circumnavition record, the Guinness World Records  response was:  &quot;If the US Department of Defense would care to present us with all the facts, we'll look at it again.&quot;&lt;ref name=Posiedon16&gt;''Confronting Poseidon'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tully noted that this information had been publicly available since the publication of ''Around the World Submerged: The Voyage of the Triton'', Captain Beach's 1962 account of Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref name=Beachappendix/&gt;&lt;ref name=Posiedon15/&gt;  Arguably, ''Triton''{{'}}s circumnavigation remains the fastest for a motorized sea vessel, beating ''Cable &amp; Wireless Adventurer''{{'}}s 1998 74-day voyage and [[MY Ady Gil|''Earthrace{{'}}s]] 2008 circumnavigation of 60 days, 23 hours, and 49&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=Posiedon15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.popularmechanics.co.za/content/outside/singlepage.asp?fid=871&amp;pno=1|title=Earthrace!|date=June 2007|journal=[[Popular Mechanics]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific &amp; national security accomplishments===
Operation Sandblast gathered extensive oceanographic, hydrographic, gravimetric, and geophysical data.  Water samples were taken throughout ''Triton''{{'}}s circumnavigation, which were tested for differences in chemical composition, salinity, density, and temperature. Such samples were vital for submarine operations. Water salinity and density affects submerged trim, as well as sonar performance, while warmer water affects the efficiency of shipboard condensers and, consequently, ship speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;  Measurements from the installed gravity meter provided a continuous record of variations in earth's gravity field throughout ''Triton''{{'}}s circumnavigation. This extensive gravity study assisted the Navy in developing navigational aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beach |first=Edward L. |authorlink=|date=November 1960 |title=''Triton'' Follows Magellan's Wake |journal=National Geographic|volume=118 |issue=5 |page=594 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 144 hydrographic bottles to track ocean currents were released during Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref&gt;Beach.

''Around the World Submerged''.&lt;/ref&gt;  These scientific data gathered during Operation Sandblast continued to be invaluable in providing information on oceanic changes, with Sydney Levitus, the director of [[NOAA|NOAA's Ocean Climate Laboratory]] in Silver Spring, Maryland, characterizing ''Triton''{{'}}s data (''pictured'') as being &quot;a very exciting set of observations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Richard Harris | title= Ship Logs Help Scientists Trace Oceans' Warming | url= http://www.vpr.net/npr/126476624/ | work= VPR News | publisher= [[Vermont Public Radio]] | date= Thursday, 05/06/10 12:00am - Morning Edition | accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Richard Harris | title= Ship Logs Help Scientists Trace Oceans' Warming | url= http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126476624 | publisher= [[National Public Radio]] | date= May 6, 2010 | accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Sandblast also proved nuclear-powered submarines could undertake extended operations independent of any external support. Specifically, ''Triton'' tested a prototype [[Inertial navigation system|ship inertial navigational system]] (SINS) for submarine use, as well as being the first submarine to test the floating [[VLF#Details of VLF submarine communication methods|very low frequency]] (VLF) communications buoy system, with both systems being vital for the Navy's upcoming [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] fleet ballistic missile submarines (FBM) deterrence patrols. Finally, the psychological testing of ''Triton''{{'}}s crew members to determine the effects of long-term isolation was particularly relevant for the initial deployment of the [[George Washington class submarine|Navy's fleet ballistic missile submarines]], as well as NASA's upcoming manned space program, [[Project Mercury]], with MIT engineers assuring NASA &quot;that getting to the moon and back was simpler than guiding an [[antiballistic missile]] or circumnavigating the earth under water in a nuclear submarine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beach |first=Edward L. |authorlink=|date=November 1960 |title=''Triton'' Follows Magellan's Wake |journal=National Geographic|volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=614–615 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aquilinefocus.blogspot.com/2008/12/psychological-officers-submarine-part-2.html |title= Submarine - Part 2  |accessdate=2009-01-20 |work= Psychological Officers |publisher=Molten Eagle |date=December 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Gruntman.

In his 2000 book ''Ships Of Discovery And Exploration'', historian Lincoln P. Paine further summarized the true accomplishment of Operation Sandlast:

{{quote|Although the voyage had been conceived as a way for [[Dwight D.

Because of the public uproar over the [[U-2 Incident of 1960|U-2 Incident]], which sparked a major Soviet-American diplomatic crisis that led to the collapse of the [[1960 Paris Summit]], most of the official celebrations for ''Triton''{{'}}s submerged circumnavigation were canceled.

===Public recognition===

On 10 May 1960, ''Triton'' received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] from Secretary of the Navy [[William B. Franke]], which was accepted by Chief Torpedoman's Mate Chester Raymond Fitzjarald,&lt;!-- spelling? --&gt; the [[Chief of the Boat|chief of the boat]], on behalf of ''Triton''{{'}}s officers and crew.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. vii, 10, 284.&lt;/ref&gt;  The citation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For meritorious achievement from 16 February 1960 to 10 May 1960.  During this period the TRITON circumnavigated the earth submerged, generally following the route of Magellan’s historic voyage. In addition to proving the ability of both crew and nuclear submarine to accomplish a mission which required almost three months of submergence, TRITON collected much data of scientific importance. The performance, determination and devotion to duty of the TRITON’s crew were in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service.  All members of the crew who made this voyage are authorized to wear the Presidential Unit Citation ribbon with a special clasp in the form of a golden replica of the globe.&lt;ref name=TheDay05111960&gt;{{cite web |first= Jim |last=Cunningham |author= |authorlink= |title= 2,000 Welcome Sub Triton On return Voyage |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D580AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7nEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1314,1269026&amp;dq=submarine+triton&amp;hl=en |archiveurl= |work= [[The Day (New London)|''The Day'']] |publisher= The Day Publishing|location=New London|page= 2 |pages= |language= |doi= |date= Wednesday Afternoon May 11, 1960 |archivedate= |accessdate=2010-03-12 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This historic voyage took his ship into strange waters under difficult and frequently unknown conditions, as a result, the TRITON collected much valuable oceanographic information. Captain Beach's sound judgment, masterful leadership, professional skill and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=11777&amp;st=&amp;st1= |title=Citation accompanying Award of Legion of Merit to Captain Edward L.

==Mission legacy==

{{Quotation|The epochal achievement of the fleet of Magellan in circumnavigating the globe was echoed in the magnificent accomplishment by the nuclear submarine ''Triton'' in 1960.  Like the voyage of Magellan, that of the ''Triton'' created stirring philosophical concepts.  It demonstrated that a company of men could live and work in the depth of the ocean for months at a time.  It was shown that thru the new technology a source of power had been made in such abundance and so manageable that, without refueling, an 8000-ton vehicle would be driven thru the water around the world.  It was also shown that the arts of observation, navigation, communication and control had reached the point where travel under the water was possible with pinpoint accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dibner. ''Victoria and Triton''. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;|Bern Dibner (1964)}}

===Triton Plaque===
[[File:Magellan-Triton.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Triton Plaque|alt=A round brass metal object features a sailing ship in the center over the U.S. Navy submarine service chest insignia of a dolphin and framed in a laurel wreath. In a circle around the edges are the Latin words &quot;Ave Nobilis Dux, Iterum Factum Est&quot; which translates to &quot;Hail Noble Captain, It is Done Again.&quot;]]

In the eight days prior to ''Triton''{{'}}s departure on her around-the-world submerged voyage, Captain Beach approached Lt. Tom B. Thamm, ''Triton''{{'}}s Auxiliary Division Officer, to design a commemorative plaque for their upcoming voyage, as well as the first circumnavigation led by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]].&lt;ref name=Beach5556&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 55–56, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque's eventual design consisted of a [[brass]] disk about {{convert|23|in|cm}} in diameter, bearing a sailing ship reminiscent of Magellan's carrack, ''Trinidad'', above the [[Submarine Warfare insignia|submarine dolphin insignia]] with the years 1519 and 1960 between them, all within a [[laurel wreath]]. Outside the wreath is the motto &lt;tt&gt;AVE NOBILIS DUX, ITERUM FACTUM EST&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;Hail Noble Captain, It Is Done Again&quot;).&lt;ref name=Beach5556/&gt;

Commodore Tom Henry, commanding Submarine Squadron 10, supervised the completion of the plaque. The carving of the wooden form was done by retired Chief Electrician's Mate Ernest L. Benson at New London. The actual molding of the plaque was done by the Mystic Foundry.&lt;ref name=Beach5556/&gt;

During the homeward leg of her around-the-world voyage, ''Triton'' rendezvoused with the destroyer {{USS|John W. Weeks|DD-701|2}} on 2 May 1960 off [[Cadiz]], Spain, the departure point for Magellan's earlier voyage. ''Triton'' broached, and ''Weeks'' transferred the finished plaque to ''Triton'' for transport back to the United States. The plaque was subsequently presented to the Spanish government by [[John Davis Lodge]], the United States Ambassador to Spain. This plaque is located at the City Hall in [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], Spain, and it is mounted on the wall of the city hall with a marble slab memorializing the 1960 ''Triton'' submerged circumnavigation.&lt;ref name=Beach263&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. pp. 263–267, 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duplicates of the Triton Plaque were also presented to the [[Mystic Seaport Museum]] in [[Mystic, Connecticut]], and the [[Naval Historical Association]] in Washington, D.C., as well as the [[U.S. Navy Submarine School]] and the U.S. Navy [[Submarine Force Library and Museum]], both located in Groton, Connecticut.&lt;ref name=Beach263/&gt;

A shadow box filled with ''Triton'' memorabilia was placed in Alcorn Auditorium of Ramage Hall located at the U.S. Navy Submarine Learning Center, [[Naval Station Norfolk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinax.com/Newsletter/Newsletter%2051/Albacore.htm |title=USS ''Albacore'' (AGSS-569) and the Submarine Hall of Fame |accessdate=2008-09-16 |author=Turner, Jack |authorlink= |date=July 2005 |work=Newsletter #51 |publisher=[[USS Spinax (SS-489)|USS ''Spinax'' (SSR/SS-489) Organization]] |pages= |doi= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417152238/http://www.spinax.com/Newsletter/Newsletter%2051/Albacore.htm |archivedate=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USS ''Triton'' Submarine Memorial Park is located along the [[Columbia River]] in Washington. Its purpose is &quot;to establish a permanent park in north Richland in recognition of all the decommissioned reactor cores off-loaded at the Port’s barge slip, transported and stored at the [[Hanford Site]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Triton Sail| url= http://www.prosser.org/media/Port%20of%20Benton%2009Fall.pdf|format=PDF|work= The re: Port of Benton | publisher= Port of Benton | date= Fall 2009| accessdate=2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park features ''Triton''{{'}}s [[sail (submarine)|sail superstructure]] (''pictured'') and eventually an information display on the history of ''Triton''. The park also serves as a tourist attraction, especially due to its location, since Hanford is the resting place of spent reactor cores from several Navy ships. The park's tentative location is at the end of Port of Benton Boulevard in north [[Richland, Washington]]. Planning called for the ''Triton'' sail to be cut up for transport and re-assembly at the park site. Ground-breaking was initially scheduled to take place on 3 April 2008, with the dedication ceremony set for 19 August 2008 and a Fall 2009 start-date for construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Sub Coming to New Richland Park|url=http://www.kndo.com/Global/story.asp?S=7901926&amp;nav=menu484_2_10 | work= Evening News | publisher= KNDO/KNDU | date= 2008-02-21 | accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Meeting Minutes | url= http://www.portofbenton.com/minutes.html | work= Board of Commissioners | publisher= Port of Benton  | date= 2008-03-28 | accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Scott Keller | title= AG &amp; COMMERCE: Port of Benton events to celebrate 50 years | url= http://www.tri-cityherald.com/progress/story/122474.html | work= Progress section | publisher= ''Tri-City Herald'' | date= 2008-03-28 | accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 October 2009, the Port of Benton encased ''Triton''{{'}}s conning tower in concrete at its new USS Triton Submarine Memorial Park in north Richland, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Historic submarine sail arrives at Richland park | url= http://www.tri-cityherald.com/kennewick_pasco_richland/story/763200.html | work= Mid-Columbia News | publisher= ''Tri-City Herald'' | date= 2009-10-22 | accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Inside the Triton's Conning Tower | url= http://www.tri-cityherald.com/galleries/gallery/765244.html  | work= Gallery | publisher= ''Tri-City Herald'' | date= 2009-10-24 | accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Inside ''Triton''{{'}}s Conning Tower | url= http://navsource.org/archives/08/pdf/0858628.pdf|format=PDF|work= Submarine Photo Archive | publisher= NavSource.org | date= 2009-03-08 | accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mid-December 2009, the final pieces of ''Triton''{{'}}s sail were welded together at the park's site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Nuclear submarine sail lands a permanent dock in Richland | url= http://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/2009/12/nuclear-submarine-sail-lands-at-permanent-dock-in-richland/ | work= Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business | publisher= TriComp Inc. | date= December 15, 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 11 August 2010 Port of Benton commission meeting, it was reported that bids for the first phase, which includes the park's electrical lighting system and the pouring the concrete around the ''Triton''{{'}}s sail, would be announced shortly by the port authority.

Writer-historian Carl LaVO wrote &quot;Incredible Voyage&quot; for the June 2010 edition of ''Naval History'' magazine, and John Beach wrote &quot;The First Submerged Circumnavigation&quot; for the April 2010 issue of ''The Submarine Review'', the official magazine of the Naval Submarine League.&lt;ref name=LaVO/&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnBeach/&gt;  Mr. Beach is the nephew of Captain Edward L. Beach, the commanding officer of USS ''Triton'' during Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finch. p. 207&quot;/&gt;  Also, the [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] published ''Beneath the Waves'' by Dr. Edward F. Finch, a 2010 biography of the late Captain Beach, which included extensive coverage of Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref name=Finch/&gt;

The legacy of Operation Sandblast on its 50th anniversary was summarized by retired Captain James C. Hay, who had served on the ''Triton'' during its historic submerged around-the-world voyage.  On the editorial page of the April 2010 issue of ''The Submarine Review'', the official magazine of the Naval Submarine League, Captain Hay noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is truly a cruise which tested the crew's mettle and proved the [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|skipper's]] ''tenacity''.  More than that, however, it again proved to all who cared to listen that the US Navy could go anywhere, at anytime, and do what ever was required.  It's a good [[Nautical fiction|sea story]] about doing what had to be done.  On the fiftieth anniversary of the First Submerged Circumnavigation it's a good thing to do to re-read about one of the forerunners of all we've done since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= James C. Hay |date= April 2010  |title= Editor's Comments |journal= The Submarine Review |publisher= Naval Submarine League |page= 2 |url= http://www.navalsubleague.com/NSL/subreview.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
