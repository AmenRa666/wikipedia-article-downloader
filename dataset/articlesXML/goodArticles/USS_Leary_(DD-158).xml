'''USS ''Leary'' (DD-158)''' was a [[Wickes class destroyer|''Wickes''-class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She was named for [[Lieutenant]] [[Clarence F. Leary]], posthumously awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] in [[World War I]].

Commissioned in 1919, she saw a number of fleet exercises and training cruises, as well as a brief period of decommissioning from 1922 to 1930. She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be equipped with [[sonar]], and the first to detect a [[Nazi Germany|German]] ship with it. With the outbreak of World War II, she escorted a number of convoys to [[Iceland]], the [[Caribbean]], and west [[Africa]] to support the war effort, later being upgraded to serve as an [[antisubmarine warfare]] vessel. On 24 December 1943, while escorting {{USS|Card|CVE-11|2}} through rough seas in the North Atlantic, she was torpedoed three times by {{GS|U-275}} and sank with the loss of 98 men.

== Design and construction ==
{{main|Wickes-class destroyer}}

''Leary'' was one of 111 [[Wickes-class destroyer|''Wickes''-class destroyer]]s built by the [[United States Navy]] between 1917 and 1919. She, along with nine of her sisters, were constructed at [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]] shipyards in [[Camden, New Jersey]] using specifications and detail designs drawn up by [[Bethlehem Steel]].{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=124}}{{sfn|Friedman|2003|p=40}}

She had a [[standard displacement]] of {{convert|1,090|t}} an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|314|ft}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|30|ft|6|in}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft}}. On trials, ''Leary'' reached a speed of {{convert|35|knots}}. She was armed with four [[4&quot;/50 caliber gun]]s, two [[3&quot;/23 caliber gun]]s, and twelve [[Mark 15 torpedo|21-inch torpedo tube]]s. She had a regular crew complement of 176 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|DANFS|1969|p=78}} She was driven by two [[Curtis steam turbine]]s powered by four [[Yarrow boiler]]s.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=124}}

Specifics on ''Leary'''s performance are not known, but she was one of the group of ''Wickes''-class destroyers known unofficially as the 'Liberty Type' to differentiate them from the destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by [[Bath Iron Works]], which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines. The 'Liberty' type destroyers deteriorated badly in service, and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in [[fuel efficiency|fuel economy]], with most only able to make {{convert|2,300|nmi}} at {{convert|15|knots}} instead of the design standard of {{convert|3,100|nmi}} at {{convert|20|knots}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=124}}{{sfn|Friedman|2003|p=41}} The class also suffered problems with turning and weight.{{sfn|Friedman|2003|p=46}}

She was the first ship to be named for [[Clarence F. Leary]]. A subsequent [[USS Leary (DD-879)|USS ''Leary'']] would be commissioned, this one a [[Gearing-class destroyer|''Gearing''-class destroyer]] completed in 1945.{{sfn|DANFS|1969|p=78}}

==Service history==
''Leary'' was laid down on 6 March 1918 and launched on 18 December 1918. She was [[ship sponsor|sponsored]] by Mrs. Anne Leary, the mother of Clarence F. Leary. She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 5 December 1919 under the command of Commander F. C. Martin.{{sfn|DANFS|1969|p=78}}

She departed Boston on 28 January 1920,{{sfn|DANFS|1969|p=78}} underwent her [[shakedown cruise]] in the [[Caribbean]] and then conducted training operations along the [[East Coast of the United States]]. In January 1921, she joined the [[Pacific Battle Fleet]], and through February took part in a large-scale battle exercise off the coast of [[Peru]]. In March, ''Leary'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] and reported to the commander of [[Naval Station Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]]. She then was on station during bombing tests conducted by the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] against naval targets, overseen by [[Billy Mitchell]]. She resumed her training exercises off the Caribbean until June 1922, when in accordance with the [[Washington Naval Conference]], she was decommissioned at the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]].{{sfn|Parkin|2001|p=194}}

Recommissioned on 1 May 1930 with a home port in [[Newport, Rhode Island]],{{sfn|Lubeski|2010|p=93}} ''Leary'' alternated between the Pacific Fleet and the [[United States Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]], carrying out training maneuvers and taking part in several [[fleet problem]]s.{{sfn|Parkin|2001|p=194}} After 1935, most of her time was taken up conducting training cruises for reserves and midshipmen.{{sfn|DANFS|1969|p=78}} In April 1937, she underwent a shipyard overhaul, including being equipped with a [[radar]]. ''Leary'' was the first U.S. navy vessel to be equipped with the device. In September 1939, ''Leary'' and {{USS|Hamilton|DD-141|2}} established a continuous patrol off the coast of New England against [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[U-Boat]]s.{{sfn|Lubeski|2010|p=94}} On 9 September 1941, she began escort missions to [[Iceland]].{{sfn|DANFS|1969|p=78}} She was also the first to make contact with a German U-Boat, while escorting a [[United Kingdom|British]] convoy in the [[North Atlantic]] on 9 November 1941.{{sfn|Parkin|2001|p=195}}

With the entry of the United States into [[World War II]] following the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Leary'' undertook regular convoy escort duties.{{sfn|Parkin|2001|p=195}} After 26 February 1942, she spent a year escorting convoys from a mid-ocean meeting point to Icelandic ports. On 7 February 1943, she left for Boston and reassignment.{{sfn|DANFS|1969|p=78}} During this time, she was given a shipyard overhaul at [[Boston Navy Yard]] and converted into an [[anti-submarine warfare]] ship. On 1 March, she left Boston for Guantanamo Bay, and undertook anti-submarine exercises with {{USS|R-5|SS-82|2}}. She then resumed escort duty, and made several trips to  [[Trinidad]] and several Caribbean ports.{{sfn|DANFS|1969|p=78}} Returning to New York on 25 June, she began escoring transatlantic convoys, and successfully escorted two of them through [[Aruba]] and to [[Algiers]] and [[Casablanca]].{{sfn|DANFS|1969|p=78}} She later joined Task Group 21.41 under the command of Captain [[Arnold J. Isbell]] and escorting {{USS|Card|CVE-11|2}}.{{sfn|Parkin|2001|p=195}}

On 24 December 1943, the task group was caught in a storm in the North Atlantic when at 01:58 in the morning, ''Leary'' made a ping on a U-Boat off her starboard bow. After her commander, [[James E. Kyes]], ordered her to battle stations but before the destroyer could react, she was struck by a [[G7es torpedo]] fired by {{GS|U-275}}. The torpedo struck her starboard side and detonated in the after engine room, killing all of the men there and damaging both propeller shafts. She quickly developed a 20 degree list to starboard, and was unable to move in the heavy seas. Unbeknownst to the task group, a second German submarine, {{GS|U-382||2}} fired at ''Leary'' but missed. Soon after, Kyes ordered the crew to abandon ship. Two additional torpedoes from ''U-275'' rocked the ship, and it rapidly sank, stern first.{{sfn|Parkin|2001|p=195}}{{sfn|Lubeski|2010|p=94}} She took 98 men with her, including Kyes. Survivors were picked up by her sister ship, {{USS|Schenck|DD-159|2}}.{{sfn|Parkin|2001|p=196}}

Three or four minutes after the second torpedo hit, the executive officer, Lt. R. B. Watson, concluded a quick inspection of the ship, during which he found a thick, gooey substance covering the deck.  He was astonished to see two seamen sitting on a torpedo tube, calmly eating Boston cream pie.  The cook had just baked a batch, the explosion spattering most of it on the deck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Atlantic Battle Won|author=Morison, Samuel Eliot |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1956 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Leary'' received one [[battle star]] for her service in World War II. For his actions in ensuring the safety of his crew, Kyes was [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]. The ''Gearing''-class destroyer {{USS|James E. Kyes|DD-787|2}} was later named for him.{{sfn|Parkin|2001|p=196}}
