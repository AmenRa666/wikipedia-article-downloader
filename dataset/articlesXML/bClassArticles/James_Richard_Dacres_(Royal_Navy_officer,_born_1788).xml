'''James Richard Dacres''', [[Royal Navy|RN]] (22 August 1788 &amp;ndash; 4 December 1853) was an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] who saw service during the [[French Revolutionary War|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the [[War of 1812]].  A member of a substantial naval dynasty, he eventually rose to the rank of [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|vice admiral]], but is chiefly remembered for his engagement with the American [[frigate]] {{USS|Constitution}} which saw the loss of his ship, {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}}.

==Family and early life==
Dacres was born in [[Lowestoft]] on 22 August 1788, the son of Captain, later Vice-Admiral, [[James Richard Dacres (1749–1810)|James Richard Dacres]] and his wife Eleanor Blandford Pearce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whos Who108&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Tracy  |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM201&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obituary: Vice-Admiral Dacres |journal=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]] |volume=XLI |issue=I |page=201 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.79255342;view=1up;seq=213 |year=1854 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dacres would eventually become a substantial naval dynasty, James's elder brother [[Barrington Dacres]] embarked on a naval career and rose to be [[post-captain]], while their uncle, [[Richard Dacres (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Dacres]] became a vice-admiral. His cousin, Richard's son [[Sydney Dacres]] would eventually be an admiral, and [[First Sea Lord]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whos Who108&quot;/&gt; James Richard Dacres entered the navy in 1796 at the age of eight, serving aboard his father's old ship, the 64-gun {{HMS|Sceptre|1781|6}}, as a first class volunteer.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM201&quot;/&gt; He moved aboard the 98-gun {{HMS|Barfleur|1768|6}} in 1797 and was present during the expedition to [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] in August 1800 as a lieutenant aboard the 74-gun [[French ship America (1788)|HMS ''Impetueux'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM201&quot;/&gt;

He was next reported aboard the 38-gun frigate {{HMS|Boadicea|1797|6}}, serving in the [[English Channel]] under Captain [[John Maitland (Royal Navy officer)|John Maitland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt; On 24 July 1803 the French 74-gun [[third-rate]] [[HMS Implacable (1805)|''Duguay-Trouin'']] and the 38-gun frigate [[HMS Guerriere (1806)|''Guerrière'']] were sighted sailing off [[Ferrol, Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy238&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM654&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gentleman's Magazine|year=1837 |page=654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maitland decided to test whether the French ships were armed [[en flûte]] and were being used as [[troopship]]s, and closing to within range, opened fire. The French returned fire, revealing they were fully armed and manned, and Maitland broke off. The French pursued, but were unable to catch him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy238&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM654&quot;/&gt; This marked Dacres's first encounter with the ''Guerrière'', a ship he was later to command under the British flag.

Dacres then moved to the [[West Indies]], where his father was commander in chief of the [[Jamaica Station (Royal Navy)|Jamaica Station]]. He served for some time as [[flag lieutenant]] aboard {{HMS|Theseus|1786|6}} and [[French ship Hercule (1798)|HMS ''Hercule'']] before being appointed to his first command, that of the 18-gun [[Cruizer class brig-sloop|''Cruizer'' class]] [[brig-sloop]] {{HMS|Elk|1804|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obituary: Vice-Admiral Dacres |journal=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]] |volume=XLI |issue=I |page=202 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.79255342;view=1up;seq=214 |year=1854 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR275&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodsley|title=Annual Register|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Command==
Dacres remained in command aboard the ''Elk'' until being transferred to the 24-gun {{HMS|Bacchante|1803|6}} on 14 January 1806.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR275&quot;/&gt; While in command of her he captured the 3-gun French [[schooner]] ''Dauphin'', crewed with 71 men, off [[St. Domingo]] on 14 February 1807.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR275&quot;/&gt; He then fell in with Captain [[William Furlong Wise]] of [[Ann and Amelia (1781 ship)|''Mediator'']] and together they navigated the waters around [[Samaná (town)|Samana]] and planned an attack on the fort there, which was a notorious haven for [[privateer]]s. The two ships mounted a four-hour-long carronade, before [[Raid on Samaná|storming the defenders]]. They captured the fort, suffering two killed and 16 wounded in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR275&quot;/&gt; Dacres returned to England after this, but on his arrival in December 1807 no command could be found for him and he went on half-pay.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt;

===North America and the ''Guerriere''===
He returned to active service again on 18 March 1811, when he was appointed to command the former French frigate {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}}, which had been captured by [[HMS Amfitrite (1804)|HMS ''Blanche'']] on 19 July 1806.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colledge150&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Colledge|title=Ships of the Royal Navy|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dacres sailed to the North American station, and shortly after the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]] was despatched by Vice-Admiral [[Herbert Sawyer]] as part of a squadron under Captain [[Philip Broke]] to intercept an American  squadron under Commodore [[John Rodgers (naval officer, War of 1812)|John Rodgers]]. Broke's squadron consisted of the 64-gun [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Africa|1781|6}} and the frigates ''[[HMS Shannon (1806)|Shannon]]'', ''[[HMS Aeolus (1801)|Aeolus]]'', {{HMS|Belvidera|1809|2}} and ''Guerriere''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borneman82&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Borneman|title=1812: The War That Forged a Nation|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dacres briefly became separated from Broke's squadron, and while returning to them on 17 August came across the {{USS|Constitution}}, under Captain [[Isaac Hull]]. He mistook the other nearby ships, which was Broke's squadron, for the American squadron under Rodgers, and so missed an opportunity to close on the ''Constitution''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forester38&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Forester|title=The Age of Fighting Sail|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chase ensued between the British and American ships, but the ''Constitution'' was finally able to escape Broke's squadron. Dacres remained with Broke, joining him in August in escorting an inbound convoy to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], after which Dacres and the ''Guerriere'' were detached to sail to Halifax and undergo a refit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forester45&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Forester|title=The Age of Fighting Sail|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battling the ''Constitution''===
{{Main|USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere}}
[[File:USS Constitution vs Guerriere.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of combat between USS ''Constitution'' and HMS ''Guerriere'' by Michel Felice Corne]]
On the afternoon of 19 August the ''Guerriere'' made contact with the ''Constitution''. Dacres prepared to fight and the two ships closed and exchanged broadsides for some time. The range eventually decreased and after a brief close exchange the ''Guerriere''{{'}}s mizzenmast was shot away, allowing the ''Constitution'' to rake her several times, causing considerable damage, before the two ships became entangled. Shortly after this ''Guerriere'' lost both her main and foremasts, leaving her largely un-manoeuvrable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forester52&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Forester|title=The Age of Fighting Sail|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the engagement Dacres had been wounded by a musket-ball in the back while on the starboard forecastle, but had refused to leave the deck.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt; ''Constitution'' then drew away to repair some damage, while Dacres attempted to set a jury rig. The attempt failed, and on ''Constitution''{{'}}s returning, Dacres fired a shot in the opposite direction to the ''Constitution''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borneman86&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Borneman|title=1812: The War That Forged a Nation|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensing that this was an attempt to signal surrender, Hull ordered a boat to take a lieutenant over to the British ship. When the lieutenant walked onto the ''Guerriere'' and asked if ''Guerriere'' was prepared to surrender, Captain Dacres responded &quot;Well, Sir, I don't know. Our mizzen mast is gone, our fore and main masts are gone-I think on the whole you might say we have struck our flag.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Borneman87&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Borneman|title=1812: The War That Forged a Nation|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dacres was brought aboard the ''Constitution'' where he presented his sword to Hull. Hull refused to accept it, saying he could not accept the sword from a man who had fought so gallantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borneman87&quot;/&gt; He also ordered that Dacres' mother's Bible be returned to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borneman87&quot;/&gt; The ''Guerriere'' was assessed but found to be unsalvageable, and was blown up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colledge150&quot;/&gt;

===Aftermath===
{{Wikisource|Letter from Captain James R. Dacres, RN, to Vice Admiral Herbert Sawyer, RN}}
Dacres briefly became a [[prisoner of war]], but was [[prisoner exchange|exchanged]] and returned to Halifax, where he was tried by [[court martial]] for the loss of his ship, which was standard procedure in the Royal Navy for the loss of a ship at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR275&quot;/&gt; He put forward as his defence the facts that the ''Guerriere'' was originally French-built and therefore not as sturdy as British-built ships, and that the ''Guerriere'' was badly decayed and on her way to refit in Halifax at the time, and the fall of the mizzen mast which crippled the ''Guerriere'' early in the fight had been due as much to rot as battle damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forester50-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Forester|title=The Age of Fighting Sail|pages=50–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no suggestion that Dacres and his men had not done their utmost, or that Dacres had been unwise to engage the ''Constitution''. He was therefore honourably acquitted of all blame for the loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR275&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Forester56-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Forester|title=The Age of Fighting Sail|pages=56–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a gratuity from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund in consideration of his wound.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR275&quot;/&gt;

==Promotion==
Dacres continued to serve in the navy after his acquittal, and was appointed to the new 38-gun frigate {{HMS|Tiber|1813|6}} on 23 July 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt; He commanded her on the [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and Channel stations until 18 September 1818. On 8 March 1815 he captured the ''Leo'', a 3-gun American privateer under Captain George Coggeshell.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt; He was appointed to command the 74-gun [[third rate]] {{HMS|Edinburgh|1811|6}} on 28 October 1833 until 1837.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt;

A temporary [[fort]] built in 1846 at the mouth of the [[Great Fish River|Fish River]] in the [[Eastern Cape|Eastern Cape Province]] during the [[Xhosa Wars#Seventh war|Seventh Xhosa War]] was named Fort Dacres in his honour.  The construction was carried out by [[sailor]]s of the British [[man-of-war]] [[HMS President (1829)|HMS ''President']].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite encyclopedia|title=Fort Dacres|encyclopedia=Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa|volume=4|pages=646|publisher=Nasionale Opvoedkundige Uitgewery Ltd, Cape Town|date=1971|isbn = 0625003209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a rear-admiral on 28 June 1838, and commander at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 9 August 1845, which was his last active employment. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 20 March 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20840|startpage=1182|date=24 March 1848|accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and later life==
Dacres married Arabella-Boyd, sister of [[Sir Adolphus Dalrymple, 2nd Baronet|Sir Adolphus Dalrymple]], on 25 April 1810.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt; She died on 11 April 1828, but the marriage produced two sons and five daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vice-Admiral James Dacres|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p33594.htm#i335935|publisher=The Peerage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One son, also called James Richard Dacres, died at [[Mozambique]] at the age of 37 on 14 February 1848, while in command of the sloop {{HMS|Nimrod|1828|6}}. Another, Hew Dalrymple Dacres died at sea at the age of 21 on 11 July 1835, having been a lieutenant in the [[67th (South Hampshire) Regiment of Foot|67th Regiment]]. They and their father are commemorated in a plaque in the parish church at [[Tetbury]], [[Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Monument&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glosgen.co.uk/tetburymi.htm |title=Inscriptions on the Monuments existing in the Parish Church at Tetbury, Gloucestershire in 1857.  |accessdate=30 January 2009|work=Transcribed from &quot;The History of the Town and Parish of Tetbury&quot;, by Rev.

Lee, published in 1857. |publisher=Stuart Flight |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Richard Dacres died at Catisfield Lodge, near [[Fareham]], [[Hampshire]] on 4 December 1853 at the age of 65.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt; He was buried in the family vault at Tetbury.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM202&quot;/&gt;
