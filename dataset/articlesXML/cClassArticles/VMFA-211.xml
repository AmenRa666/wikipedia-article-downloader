'''Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211''' (VMFA-211) is a [[United States Marine Corps]] fighter attack squadron, currently consisting of [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35B Lightning II]] [[stealth aircraft|stealth]] [[STOVL]] [[strike fighter]] jets. Known as the &quot;Wake Island Avengers&quot; and the &quot;Bastion Defenders&quot;, the squadron is based at [[Marine Corps Air Station Yuma]], [[Arizona]] and falls under the command of [[Marine Aircraft Group 13]] (MAG-13) and the [[3rd Marine Aircraft Wing]] (3rd MAW).

In September 2012, while (then) VMA-211 was deployed to [[Camp Bastion]], [[Helmand Province]], Afghanistan, the Taliban attacked and destroyed several of the squadron's Harrier aircraft. Despite being armed with only a handgun, the squadron's commander, LtCol. [[Christopher Raible|Christopher K. Raible]], lead a counterattack against the Taliban insurgents, but was killed by an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/slain-marine-commanders-actions-in-afghanistan-called-heroic/2012/09/21/f4703c76-042d-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
VMFA-211 is one of two F-35B Lightning II squadrons assigned to [[Marine Aircraft Group 13]], [[3rd Marine Aircraft Wing]]. Its mission is to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft under all weather conditions and attack and destroy surface targets in support of Marine expeditionary forces.

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Three Grumman F3F-2 of VMF-2 flying in formation in the late 1930s.jpg|thumb|left|Grumman F3Fs of VMF-2]]

VMFA-211 can trace its lineage to 1 January 1937 when Marine Fighting Squadron 4 (VF-4M) was activated at [[Naval Air Station San Diego]], California.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rottman p.441&quot;&gt;Rottman p.441.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it was the second time a VF-4M had existed, the previous one was decommissioned in 1931 and it was not considered the same squadron. The squadron was decommissioned in 1933 but was recommissioned as &quot;VF-8M&quot; in 1935. On 1 July 1937, VF-8M was re-designated Marine Fighting Squadron 2 (VMF-2) and by the end of the year, had completely reequipped with [[Grumman F3F|Grumman F3F-2s]] which replaced their F3F-1s and a few even older F2F-1s. The squadron participated in annual Fleet Problems while at San Diego and even played a part in the making of the movie ''Dive Bomber''. Several future Medal of Honor recipients served with the squadron during this period, including [[Henry Elrod]], [[Robert Galer]], and [[Gregory Boyington]]. In January 1941, the squadron moved to [[Marine Corps Air Station Ewa]], Hawaii and was re-designated VMF-211 on July 1, 1941.

===World War II===
[[File:Wreckage Wildcat Wake Island.jpg|thumb|right|Wreckage of Capt Elrod's [[F4F Wildcat|F4F-3]] after the Japanese captured Wake Island]]

In November 1941, VMF-211 embarked 12 of its 24 F4F-3 Wildcats and 13 of its 29 pilots aboard the {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} for movement to [[Wake Island]], the scene of the squadron's heroic battle. On December 8, 1941 the Japanese attacked Wake, destroying seven of the aircraft on the ground. Over the next two weeks, the remaining five planes repelled numerous attacks and inflicted great losses on the enemy.

During the course of this defense, the Marine ground forces and VMF-211 caused the loss of at least four enemy warships, including the first major Japanese naval vessels sunk during the Pacific war.  The squadron was also credited with 8 aircraft destroyed. After the loss of its last aircraft, the squadron became a ground unit and fought until the surrender of the atoll. The first Marine airman to be awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] in [[World War II]] was VMF-211's [[Henry T. Elrod]]. A planned operation to reinforce Wake Island was deemed too dangerous by the fleet command, and on December 23 Wake Island was finally overrun by a numerically superior enemy.

[[File:F4U AD CVG-4 CVA-43 1953.jpg|thumb|right|VMF-211 F4U-4s on the [[USS Coral Sea (CV-43)|''Coral Sea'']] in 1952]]

The squadron's rear echelon at [[Marine Corps Air Station Ewa]] lost all but one of its twelve F4F-3s during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and even this lone survivor was lost when it was transferred to the [[United States Navy|Navy]].  Slowly rebuilding as personnel and aircraft became available, the squadron, now under the command of Major Luther S. Moore was deployed in May 1942 to [[Palmyra Atoll]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] and adopted the name &quot;Avengers&quot; in memory of those squadron members who were killed or captured on Wake Island. When first deployed, VMF-211 was equipped with the [[Brewster Buffalo|Brewster F2A-3]] and it was not until July that sufficient numbers of Grumman [[F4F Wildcat|F4F-4 Wildcats]] became available to re-equip the squadron.  As the Pacific Campaign continued the squadron transitioned to the [[F4U Corsair]] for the remainder of the war.  VMF-211 participated in the [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Treasury-Bougainville Campaign]], [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], Northern Solomon, [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] and Southern Philippine campaigns.

===After World War II===
[[File:AD Skyraider VMA-211 Onslow Beach NC.jpg|thumb|A VMA-211 AD-4N over [[Onslow Beach]] ]]

After World War II, VMF-211 participated in the occupation of [[China]] where they would eventually provide cover for American forces evacuating the country before the Communist takeover in December 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Mersky, ''U.S. Marine Corps Aviation'', p.121.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this action they returned to [[Northeastern Regional Airport|Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Field Edenton]], [[North Carolina]], in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rottman p.441&quot;/&gt; While operating aboard the [[USS Coral Sea (CV-43)]] in 1952, the squadron was redesignated Marine Attack Squadron 211 ('''VMA-211''') when they transitioned to the [[A-1 Skyraider|AD-4N Skyraider]]. In 1957, the squadron received its first [[A-4 Skyhawk|A4D-1 Skyhawk]]s and subsequently moved to [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan]] in 1958. VMA-211 flew several versions of the Skyhawk, receiving the A4D-2 (A-4B) in 1958, the A4D-2N (A-4C) in 1960, the A-4E in 1964, and the A-4M in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skyhawk.org/4e/vma211/vma211.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War===
[[File:A-4E VMA-211 NAS Cubi Point 1971.jpg|thumb|VMA-211 A-4Es in 1971]]

With escalation of the Vietnam War, VMA-211 moved to Iwakuni [[Japan]] in 1965 and commenced the first of four deployments to the [[Republic of Vietnam]] Chu Lai. LtCol. F.H. Thurston became the CO of the Squadron on August 25, 1967. In August 1976, the squadron returned to MCAS El Toro.

VMA-211 was deployed in the spring of 1972 to Naha Air Force base on Okinawa and within three months was redeployed to Bien Hoa Air Base in Viet Nam. It was the only strategic American fighting unit left in Viet Nam except for small Army Air Cav unit in Bien Hoa.

===Post Vietnam===
In September 1987, the squadron celebrated an aviation milestone when it passed 30 years of flying the McDonnell Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. After successfully completing the last overseas deployment with the A-4M Skyhawk in 1989, VMA-211 began transferring these aircraft to the [[4th Marine Aircraft Wing]] in preparation for transition to the AV-8B Night Attack aircraft. In June 1990 the squadron began flying the Night Attack variant of the Harrier. During this time the Avengers were awarded Marine Corps Aviation Association &quot;Attack Squadron of the Year&quot; three times, in 1995, 1996, and 1998.

In September 2000, the squadron began introduction of the latest Harrier variant, the AV-8B II+ radar aircraft. The squadron soon fielded a complement of both Radar and Night Attack Harriers.

===Global War on Terror===
After the September 11 terror attacks, the squadron deployed to the Arabian Sea aboard the [[USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6)]]. The Avengers participated in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], flying combat missions against targets in [[Afghanistan]] from January to March 2002.

After a short break, the following January found the Avengers aboard the ''USS Bonhomme Richard''. This time the squadron was headed for the [[Persian Gulf]], in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] (OIF). In one month of combat flying, the squadron flew over 360 sorties and 640 hours of flight time. The squadron returned to [[Marine Corps Air Station Yuma]] in May 2003.

[[File:AV-8B Harrier VMA-211 refueling over Iraq 2006.jpg|right|thumb|A VMA-211 Harrier II refueling over Iraq in October 2006]]

The squadron  deployed to Iraq off [[USS Essex (LHD-2)]] from October 2004 through February 2005 where they were based at [[Al Asad Airbase]]. They again deployed to Al Asad from the USS Tarawa in support of OIF from October 2005 until January 2006.

In September 2006, the Avengers again deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom to [[Al Asad Air Base]].  From January til August 2009, the squadron again deployed as part of the [[31st Marine Expeditionary Unit]] on board the [[USS Essex (LHD-2)]].

In April 2012, the Avengers deployed in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], moving from [[Kandahar Airfield]] to British-run [[Camp Bastion]] in July.

While at Camp Bastion, the Avengers experienced six Harriers destroyed, and two severely damaged, during an [[14 September 2012 Camp Bastion attack|attack on the base]] in September. Two Marines were also killed, including the squadron commander LtCol. [[Christopher Raible|Christopher K. Raible]].&lt;ref&gt;http://theaviationist.com/2012/09/16/vma-211/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/15/world/asia/afghanistan-fatal-attack/index.html?hpt=hp_t1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/world/asia/green-on-blue-attacks-in-afghanistan-continue.html?pagewanted=all Audacious Raid on NATO Base Shows Taliban’s Reach]&lt;/ref&gt; Occurring during the heat of the 2012 Presidential campaign, John Gresham on the Defense Media Network called this successful Taliban attack  &quot;arguably the worst day in [U.S. Marine Corps] aviation history since the Tet Offensive of 1968.&quot;{{cn|date=October 2016}}

In September 2014, the Avengers deployed to Bahrain to support the fight on terrorism in Iraq and Syria until April 2015.

===Transition to F-35B Lightning II===
[[File:Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211 First Flight 160629-M-PL003-061.jpg|thumb|A VMFA-211 F-35B in June 2016.]]
The Avengers conducted their last AV-8B Harrier flight on 6 May 2016 and received their first two F-35B Lightning IIs on 9 May. On 30 June 2016, VMA-211 was redesignated as VMFA-211, becoming the second fleet squadron in the Marine Corps to operate the F-35B ''Lightning II'' as their primary aircraft.
