The '''''Francop Affair''''' was a [[high seas]] incident on November 4, 2009 in which the [[Israeli Navy]] seized the cargo ship [[MV Francop|MV ''Francop'']] in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] and its cargo of hundreds of tons of weapons allegedly bound from [[Iran]] to [[Hezbollah]]. The incident is also known by its military operation name, '''Operation Four Species'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126397.html|title=Report: U.S. stopped Israel from attacking 'Hezbollah arms ship'|date=6 November 2009|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Israeli commanders had received intelligence reports that the ship {{MV|Francop}} was carrying weapons originating from [[Iran]], which were to be transferred to [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot;/&gt; The ship was about {{convert|160|km|-1}} off the coast of [[Israel]], near [[Cyprus]], when it was stopped.

On November 4, 2009, the ship was radioed by an Israeli Navy [[missile boat]], which ordered it to halt and prepare for inspection. [[Shayetet 13]] naval [[commando]]s then boarded the ship without resistance.  The navy said that the crew was not aware of the purported smuggling and cooperated with the commandos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haaretz&quot;/&gt; The commandos broke open the shipping containers and discovered crates of weapons and munitions hidden between sacks of polyethylene stacked along the openings and sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLCLYVjwomQ|title=IDF Navy commandoes board the Francop|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) said the ship was carrying &quot;dozens of shipping containers, carrying numerous weapons, disguised as civilian cargo among hundreds of other containers on board&quot;. After boarding, the Israeli navy directed the ship to the Israeli [[port of Ashdod]] where a thorough inspection was held.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haaretz&quot;/&gt;

According to the IDF, the ship picked up the cargo in [[Damietta]], [[Egypt]]; the cargo arrived in Egypt on a ship that sailed from [[Bandar Abbas]], [[Iran]] on October 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haaretz&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Anshel |last=Pfeffer |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126069.html |title=Israel seizes ship in Mediterranean carrying more than 3,000 rockets |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship was then set to sail to [[Limassol]], Cyprus and then [[Latakia]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haaretz&quot;/&gt;  The IDF suspects that the cargo was intended for Hezbollah, which fought Israel in the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. Following the war, [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|Resolution 1701]] forbade the shipments of arms to Hezbollah. In 2010, the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929]] authorized states to seize items, including arms, that Iran is forbidden from exporting.

An Israeli naval chief said that the amount of weapons found is ten times more than that found during [[Operation Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ynet&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Hanan |last=Greenberg |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3800306,00.html |title=Navy: 10 times more arms on ship than on Karin-A |publisher=[[Ynet]] |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms shipment weighed 320 tons and were held in containers marked with Iranian shipping codes.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Teibel |last=Amy |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h3S0DqyLu9CfgcBASy2XHOGCk0IAD9BPAIG80 |title=Hezbollah denies link to arms ship |publisher=[[Google News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite news | url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455195197&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull | title=The haul: 320 tons of Katyushas, other rockets, shells and bullets | last=Katz | first=Yaakov | date=2009-11-05 | work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | publisher=jpost.com | accessdate=2009-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seized weaponry consisted of 9,000 [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar shells]], 2,125 107-mm [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rocket]]s, 685 rocket fuses, 690 122-mm rockets, 21,100 F-1 fragmentation hand grenades, and 566,220 [[AK-47]] rounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haaretz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh-pnuMJh3o&amp;feature=related|title=Slide Show of Weaponry Found on The 'Francop'|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Israeli military said that the shipment was equivalent to about ten percent of Hezbollah's stocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haaretz&quot;/&gt; The arms shipment was the largest ever seized by Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot;/&gt;

On November 5, 2009, ambassadors and diplomats from 44 countries, military attaches from 27 armies in the world, and the international media were invited by the IDF and the Foreign Ministry to show them the weapons and munitions seized from the ''Francop'' ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDF&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/11/0505.htm |title=Ambassadors, Military Attaches Witness Weapons Seized from ''Francop'' |publisher=[[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506234851/http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/11/0505.htm |archivedate=May 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[President of Israel]] [[Shimon Peres]] said, &quot;Today the whole world can see the large gap between Syria and Iran's statements and their actual activities. The ship's arrest is not only of critical military importance, but also of political importance. Facts cannot be argued with.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Boudreaux |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-israel-arms-boat5-2009nov05,0,7130886.story |title=Israel seizes ship with alleged Hezbollah-bound arms |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] called it &quot; a war crime that the UN Security Council should have a special meeting over&quot;.

[[Hezbollah]] made a statement to the press in which it denied &quot;any connection with the weapons which the Zionist enemy claims it seized aboard the ''Francop'' ship&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot;/&gt; [[Palestinian Authority]] spokesperson Ghassan Khatib stated that &quot;Since the Israeli leadership and society are not ready for peace, they are using any pretext to shun peace obligations, and one is the issue of the Iranian shipment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khaleej Times&quot;/&gt;

An [[Iran]]ian media source commentary claimed that &quot;Israeli propaganda&quot; was aimed at diverting attention from U.N. allegations of Israeli [[war crime]]s during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Khaleej Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2009/November/middleeast_November176.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col=|title=Israel accuses Iran of war crime over arms ship |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2009-11-06 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Khaleej Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syria]]n Foreign Minister [[Walid Muallem]] said, &quot;Unfortunately, some official pirates in the seas, sometimes in the name of the navy, sometimes in the name of inspection, obstruct trade movement between Syria and Iran. This ship does not carry Iranian weapons to Syria and does not contain military material to manufacture weapons in Syria. This ship carries imported goods from Syria to Iran.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8343673.stm |title=Iran and Syria deny arms claims |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After photos of the shipment was released by Israel the IRNA news agency claimed the shipping manifest from the &quot;Ministry of Sepah&quot; was forged citing that the Sepah ministry was renamed to &quot;Defense Ministry&quot; more than 20 years ago and that &quot;if a country plans to send a secret arms cargo to another, it will not brand the shipment with a full description&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=111410&amp;sectionid=351020101 Press TV: Israel gaffe reveals 'Iran ship photos' were forged]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2009/11/16/Israel-faked-Francop-arms-claims-Iran/UPI-34621258400131/ Israel faked ''Francop'' arms claims -- Iran] [[UPI]] November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In response the Israel MFA say that those 'Sepah' customs labels were found on some old crates of ammunition (7.62mm bullets, 122mm rockets and 106mm anti-tank shells).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themajlis.org/2009/11/17/ship-of-fools-ctd-the-israeli-government-responds#more Ship of fools ctd.: The Israeli government response ] November 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
