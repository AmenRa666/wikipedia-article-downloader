The '''remembrance poppy''' is an [[artificial flower]] that has been used since 1921 to commemorate military personnel who have died in war, and represents a common or field poppy, ''[[Papaver rhoeas]]''. Inspired by the [[World War I]] poem &quot;[[In Flanders Fields]]&quot;, and promoted by [[Moina Michael]], they were first adopted by the [[American Legion]] to commemorate [[United States|American]] soldiers killed in that war (1914–1918). They were then adopted by [[veteran|military veterans]]' groups in parts of the [[British Empire]]: the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Today, they are most common in the UK, [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association|New Zealand]] and Canada, and are used to commemorate their servicemen and women killed in all conflicts. There, small artificial poppies are often worn on clothing leading up to [[Remembrance Day]]/[[Armistice Day]] (11 November).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-15637074 BBC News. Retrieved 14 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Poppy [[wreath]]s are also often laid at [[war memorial]]s. In New Zealand they are worn on [[Anzac Day]], (25th April) in commemoration of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].

==Origins==
The remembrance poppy was inspired by the World War I poem &quot;[[In Flanders Fields]]&quot;. Its opening lines refer to the many poppies that were the first flowers to grow in the churned-up earth of soldiers' graves in [[Flanders]], a region of Europe that overlies a part of [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc10nov06&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = | title =Where did the idea to sell poppies come from?  | publisher =BBC News | date =10 November 2006 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6133312.stm  | accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written from the point of view of the dead soldiers and, in the last verse, they call on the living to continue the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;&gt;Fox, James. &quot;Poppy Politics: Remembrance of Things Present&quot;, in ''Cultural Heritage Ethics: Between Theory and Practice''. Open Book Publishers, 2014. pp.23-28&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was written by [[Canada|Canadian]] physician, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John McCrae]], on 3 May 1915 after witnessing the death of his friend, a fellow soldier, the day before. The poem was first published on 8 December 1915 in the [[London]]-based magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.

[[Image:00MoinaMichael.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Moina Michael on a 1948 U.S. commemorative stamp]]In 1918, [[Moina Michael]], who had taken leave from her professorship at the [[University of Georgia]] to be a volunteer worker for the [[United States|American]] [[YWCA USA|YWCA]], was inspired by the poem and published a poem of her own called &quot;[[We Shall Keep the Faith]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=DLG&gt;{{cite news | author = | title =Moina Michael | publisher =Digital Library of Georgia/[[University of Georgia]] | date = | url =http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/mmichael.htm | accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tribute to McCrae's poem, she vowed to always wear a red remembrance poppy as a symbol of remembrance for those who fought and helped in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc10nov06&quot;/&gt; At a November 1918 YWCA Overseas War Secretaries' conference, she appeared with a silk poppy pinned to her coat and distributed 25 more to those attending. She then campaigned to have the poppy adopted as a national symbol of remembrance. At a conference in 1920, the National American Legion adopted it as their official symbol of remembrance.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc10nov06&quot;/&gt; At this conference, Frenchwoman Anna E. Guérin was inspired to introduce the artificial poppies commonly used today. In 1921 she sent her poppy sellers to London, where they were adopted by [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig]], a founder of the [[Royal British Legion]]. It was also adopted by veterans' groups in [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc10nov06&quot;/&gt; James Fox notes that all of the countries who adopted the remembrance poppy were the &quot;victors&quot; of World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Poppies by Benoit Aubry of Ottawa.JPG|thumb|350px|Canadian poppies]]In Canada, the poppy is the official symbol of remembrance worn during the two weeks before 11 November, having been adopted in 1921. The [[Royal Canadian Legion]], which has [[trademark]]ed the image,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legion.ca/honour-remember/the-poppy-trademark/|title=The Royal Canadian Legion Poppy Trademark - The Royal Canadian Legion|work=The Royal Canadian Legion|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that poppies be worn on the left lapel, or as near the heart as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vac-acc.gc.ca/general/sub.cfm?source=teach_resources/poppy |title=Poppy Facts - Veterans Affairs Canada |publisher=Vac-acc.gc.ca |date=1999-10-21 |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1996, poppies were made by disabled veterans in Canada, but they have since been made by a private contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Webmaster, Patrick Riley |url=http://www.legion.ca/Poppy/campaign_e.cfm |title=The Royal Canadian Legion |publisher=Legion.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian poppies consist of two pieces of moulded plastic covered with [[Flocking (texture)|flocking]] with a pin to fasten them to clothing. At first the poppies were made with a black centre. From 1980 to 2002, the centres were changed to green. Current designs are black only; this change caused confusion and controversy to those unfamiliar with the original design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/16w-16e/nr-sp/index-eng.asp?id=180&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, sticker versions of the poppy were made for children, the elderly, and healthcare and food industry workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Julia| last = Skikavich| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = New sticker poppies are catching on| url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/11/05/poppy-stickers.html| work = | publisher = CBC News| id = | pages = | page = | date = 2008-11-05| accessdate = 2008-11-12| language = | quote = | archiveurl = | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|UK}} Canada also issues a cast metal &quot;Canada Remembers&quot; pin featuring a gold maple leaf and two poppies, one representing the fallen and the other representing those who remained on the [[home front]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B3nMfjn73O0gOWE2NDkxMGQtYTRjOS00ZDE0LTk5ZDMtOWRlNGRmY2U0ODY2&amp;sort=name&amp;layout=list&amp;pid=0B3nMfjn73O0gYzNkZGFiODktYTA4Ny00MTAxLWFkOTgtZDE3OTQ2MDk0ZTYx&amp;cindex=18 ''Canada Remembers Program Policy Manual''], Veterans Affairs Canada, 2009 revision&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the installation of the [[Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]] in [[Ottawa]] in 2000, where the national Remembrance service is held, a new tradition formed spontaneously as attendees laid their poppies on the tomb at the end of the service. This tradition, while not part of the official program, has become widely practised elsewhere in the country, with others leaving cut flowers, photographs, or letters to the deceased.

====Newfoundland====

Since joining Canada on April 1st., 1949, the Remembrance Poppy and [[Armistice Day]] (November 11th.) commemorations have in large measure displaced [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland's]] own commemorative floral emblem, the [[forget-me-not]], and national commemorative [[Memorial Day (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Memorial Day]] held July 1st. each year.  Although in recent years the forget-me-not has had somewhat of a resurgence&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2016-06-22/article-4567810/Special-Forget-Me-Nots/1 &quot;Special Forget-Me-Nots&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in Newfoundland cultural practices surrounding the island's military deaths&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/forget-me-not-newfoundland-legion-beaumont-hamel-1.3360692&lt;/ref&gt; the Remembrance Poppy is far more commonly encountered than the forget-me-not.

====Australia====
In Australia, remembrance poppies have been used since 1921 to commemorate Australian soldiers who died in war. On Remembrance Day (11 November) and [[Anzac Day]] (25 April) they are laid at war memorials, and are sold by the [[Returned and Services League of Australia]] (RSL) in return for donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Red Poppy - Australian Army|url = http://www.army.gov.au/Our-history/Traditions/The-Red-Poppy|website = www.army.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
[[File:NZRSA remembrance poppy.jpg|thumb|200px|New Zealand remembrance poppy]]In New Zealand, remembrance poppies are most often worn on Anzac Day (25 April) to commemorate New Zealand soldiers who died in war. They are also worn on Remembrance Day, and are sold by the [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association]] (RSA) in return for donations. The RSA planned to hold its first Poppy Day appeal around the time of Armistice Day 1921, as other countries were doing. However, the ship carrying the poppies from France arrived in New Zealand too late, and so the association waited until Anzac Day 1922. This first Poppy Day appeal was a success. Most of the money raised went to needy soldiers and their families, while the rest went to the French Children's League to help relieve suffering in war-ravaged areas of northern France.

The popularity of Poppy Day grew and there were record collections during the Second World War. By 1945, 750,000 poppies were being distributed nationwide, which equated to half the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The red poppy - Anzac Day {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online|url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/anzac-day/poppies|website = www.nzhistory.net.nz|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], remembrance poppies are sold by [[The Royal British Legion]] (RBL). This is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] providing financial, social, political and emotional support to those who have served or who are currently serving in the [[British Armed Forces]], and their dependants. They are sold on the streets by volunteers in the weeks before Remembrance Day. The remembrance poppy is the [[trademark]] of The Royal British Legion.&lt;ref name=ipo1&gt;{{cite web|title=EU000681452|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/4/EU000681452|website=IPO|publisher=Intellectual Property Office|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ipo3&gt;{{cite web|title=EU004066271|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/4/EU004066271|website=IPO|publisher=Intellectual Property Office|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ipo2&gt;{{cite web|title=EU000681452|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmowner/Owner/Results?name=British%20Legion&amp;postcode=|website=IPO|publisher=Intellectual Property Office|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RBL state, &quot;The red poppy is our [[trademark|registered mark]] and its only lawful use is to raise funds for the Poppy Appeal&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-15654558 &quot;Wiltshire woman's poppy teardrop 'violates trademark'&quot;].

The RBL says these poppies are &quot;worn to commemorate the sacrifices of our Armed Forces and to show support to those still serving today&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/poppy-appeal Poppy Appeal 2014 - The Royal British Legion website].

In [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]], the poppies typically have two red paper petals mounted on a green plastic stem with a single green paper leaf and a prominent black plastic central boss. The stem has an additional branch used to anchor the poppy via a pin in the lapel or buttonhole. In [[Scotland]], the poppies are curled and have four petals with no leaf. The yearly selling of poppies is a major source of income for the RBL in the UK. The poppy has no fixed price; it is sold for a donation or the price may be suggested by the seller. The black plastic center of the poppy was marked &quot;[[Haig Fund]]&quot; until 1994 but is now marked &quot;Poppy Appeal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/index.html |title=White Poppies For Peace |publisher=Ppu.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of about 50 people—most of them disabled former British military personnel—work all year round to make millions of poppies at the [[Poppy Factory]] in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.poppyfactory.org/|title=The Royal British Legion Poppy Factory|publisher=The Royal British Legion|accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish poppies are made in the [[Lady Haig's Poppy Factory]] in Edinburgh.

For many years after World War I, poppies were worn only on Remembrance Day itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Letters to the Daily Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/3634134/Letters-to-the-Daily-Telegraph.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Letters to the Daily Telegraph | date=2006-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, today the RBL's &quot;Poppy Appeal&quot; has a higher profile than any other charity appeal in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Letters to the Daily Telegraph&quot;/&gt; The poppies are widespread from late October until mid-November every year and are worn by the general public, politicians, the Royal Family and other public figures. It has become common to see large poppies on buses, tube trains and aeroplanes as well as on lampposts, billboards, public buildings and landmarks. Many newspapers and magazines show a poppy on their cover page, and some [[Social network service|social network]] users add poppies to their [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twibbon.com/join/Royal-British-Legion-2|title=Search for a Campaign - Twibbon|work=Twibbon|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, an official Poppy Appeal [[Single (music)|single]] has been released.&lt;ref name=jossstone&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/joss-stone-criticised-over-sentimentalising-famed-anti-war-song-for-poppy-appeal-9847312.html &quot;Joss Stone criticised for sentimentalising famed anti-war song for Poppy Appeal&quot;].

''[[The Daily Mail]]'', 10 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There are thousands of poppy sellers on the streets and numerous fundraising events; such as concerts, fairs, marathons and competitions. There are also many other events to raise awareness. For example, in 2011, a Second World War plane dropped 6,000 poppies over the town of [[Yeovil]] in [[Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-15507929 &quot;WWII plane drops poppies over Yeovil&quot;].

In recent years, there has been growing controversy over the Poppy Appeal. Some—including British Army veterans—have argued that the Poppy Appeal has become excessive and garish, that it is being used to marshal support behind British military campaigns, and that poppy wearing has become compulsory for public figures.&lt;ref name=poppyveterans&gt;[http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/05/poppy-appeal-subverted-veterans-complain &quot;Poppy appeal's original aims being subverted, veterans complain&quot;].

In 1997 and again in 2000 the Royal British Legion registered the Poppy under Intellectual Property Rights (1997 Case EU000557058)&lt;ref&gt;75&lt;/ref&gt; and Trade Mark (2000 Trade Mark 2239583).&lt;ref&gt;76&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic has its own [[National Day of Commemoration]] in July for all Irish people who died in war.

In the years following the War of Independence, the poppy was particularly controversial, with nationalists seeing it as a provocative symbol of British imperialism. In Dublin, British Legion marchers often had poppies snatched from their lapels, which led to street fights. In response, some poppy-wearers hid razor blades in their poppies.&lt;ref&gt;McGarry, Fearghal. ''Republicanism in Modern Ireland''.

==Other designs and purposes==

===White poppies===
[[File:Anzac poppies.JPG|thumb|A white poppy left on [[Anzac Day]] in New Zealand, 2009]]
Some people choose to wear [[White poppy (symbol)|white poppies]] as a [[pacifism|pacifist]] alternative to the red poppy. The white poppy and white poppy wreaths were introduced by Britain's [[Co-operative Women's Guild]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/white_cwg.html |title=White Poppies For Peace |publisher=[[Peace Pledge Union]] |date=1938-11-11 |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, white poppies are sold by [[Peace Pledge Union]] or may be home-made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/index.html |title=White Poppies Are For Peace |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |date= |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The white poppy may be worn alone or alongside the red poppy. According to the Peace Pledge Union, it symbolizes remembrance of all casualties of war including civilian casualties, and non-British casualties, to stand for peace, and not to glamorize war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purple poppies===
To commemorate animal victims of war, [[Animal Aid]] in Britain has issued a purple poppy, which can be worn alongside the traditional red one, as a reminder that both humans and animals have been – and continue to be – victims of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/CAMPAIGNS/living//2256/|title=PURPLE POPPY: COMMEMORATING THE ANIMAL VICTIMS OF WAR|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8333733.stm|title= The dos and don'ts of poppy etiquette|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 October 2013|date=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the purple poppy was abolished due to a perceived misunderstanding by the issuing organization.

==Protests and controversy==
In 1993, The Royal British Legion complained that ''[[Cannon Fodder (video game)|Cannon Fodder]]'', a video game with an anti-war message, had planned to use a poppy on its cover. The Legion, along with some politicians, called it &quot;offensive to millions&quot; and &quot;monstrous&quot;. The publisher was forced to change the cover before the game was released.

In 2010 a group of British Army veterans issued an open letter complaining that the Poppy Appeal had become excessive and garish, that it was being used to marshal support behind British military campaigns, and that people were being pressured into wearing poppies.&lt;ref name=poppyveterans/&gt; In 2014, the group protested by holding an alternative remembrance service: they walked to [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|The Cenotaph]] under the banner &quot;Never Again&quot; with a wreath of white poppies to acknowledge civilians killed in war. Their tops bore the message &quot;War is Organised Murder&quot;, a quote from [[Harry Patch]], the last survivor of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/never-again-anti-war-veterans-to-carry-white-poppy-wreath-to-cenotaph-9833246.html &quot;'Never again': Anti-war veterans to carry white-poppy wreath to Cenotaph&quot;].

In the run-up to Remembrance Day, it has become common for UK [[Association football|football]] teams to play with artificial poppies sewn to their shirts, at the request of the Royal British Legion. This has caused some controversy. At a [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] v [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] match in November 2010, a group of Celtic supporters, called the [[Green Brigade]], unfurled a large banner in protest at the team wearing poppies. In a statement, it said: &quot;Our group and many within the Celtic support do not recognise the British Armed Forces as heroes, nor their role in many conflicts as one worthy of our remembrance&quot;.

British Prime Minister David Cameron rejected a request from [[China|Chinese]] officials to remove his poppy during his visit to [[Beijing]] on Remembrance Day 2010. The poppy was deemed offensive because it was mistakenly assumed to be connected with the Anglo-Chinese Opium Wars in the 19th century, after which the [[Qing Dynasty]] was forced to tolerate the British [[History of opium in China|opium trade]] in China and to cede [[Hong Kong]] to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-09/cameron-risks-spat-with-chinese-by-wearing-poppy-during-visit-to-beijing.html|title=Cameron Risks Spat With Chinese by Wearing Poppy During Visit |date=9 November 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg LP |accessdate=12 November 2011 |first=Robert |last=Hutton}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cameron wore a poppy in 2015 when he met Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] in London.

The picture was reported to police by a member of the RBL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/nov/03/poppy-burning-northern-ireland-arrests?newsfeed=true | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Henry | last=McDonald | title=Poppy-burning image leads to Northern Ireland arrests | date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, a young [[Canterbury]] man was arrested for allegedly posting a picture of a burning poppy on Facebook, on suspicion of an offence under the Malicious Communications Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|title='Poppycock': Man's arrest for posting image of burning poppy on Facebook is condemned by civil liberties activists|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/poppycock-mans-arrest-for-posting-image-of-burning-poppy-on-facebook-is-condemned-by-civil-liberties-activists-8306784.html|publisher=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=4 February 2013|location=London|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
