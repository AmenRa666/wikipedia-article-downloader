'''Operation Entebbe ''' was a successful [[counter-terrorist]] hostage-rescue mission carried out by [[Sayeret Matkal|commandos]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) at [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]] in [[Uganda]] on 4 July 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hostages freed as israelis raid uganda airport&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60816FA38591B728DDDAD0894DF405B868BF1D3|title=Hostages Freed as Israelis Raid Uganda Airport; Commandos in 3 Planes Rescue 105-Casualties Unknown Israelis Raid Uganda Airport And Free Hijackers' Hostages|last=Smith|first=Terence |work=The New York Times|accessdate=4 July 2009 | date=4 July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week earlier, on 27 June, an [[Air France]] plane with 248 passengers had been [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by two members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations]] (PFLP-EO) under orders of [[Wadie Haddad]] (who had earlier broken away from the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]] of [[George Habash]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartuv&quot;/&gt; and two members of the German [[Revolutionary Cells (RZ)|Revolutionary Cells]].

The IDF acted on information provided by the Israeli intelligence agency [[Mossad]]. The hijackers threatened to kill the hostages if their prisoner release demands were not met.

The operation took place at night. Israeli transport planes carried 100 commandos over {{convert|2500|mi|km}} to Uganda for the rescue operation. The operation, which took a week of planning, lasted 90 minutes. 102 hostages were rescued.

On 27 June 1976, Air France Flight 139, an [[Airbus A300|Airbus A300B4-203]], [[Aircraft registration|registration]] {{Airreg|F|BVGG}} (c/n 019), departed from [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, carrying 246 mainly [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Israelis|Israeli]] passengers and a crew of 12.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenkovitch&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/surviving-the-myth-1.95789 |title=Surviving the myth |author=Aviv Lavie |date=31 July 2003 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;How the Rescue Took Place&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jta.org/1976/07/06/archive/how-the-rescue-took-place |title=How the Rescue Took Place |work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency| date=5 July 1976 |accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane flew to Athens, Greece, where it picked up an additional 58 passengers, including four hijackers.&lt;ref name=&quot;General Dan Shomron&quot; /&gt;{{#tag:ref|

Just after takeoff, the flight was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by two [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] from the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations]] (PFLP-EO), and by two Germans, [[Wilfried Böse]] and [[Brigitte Kuhlmann]], from the German [[Revolutionary Cells (German group)|Revolutionary Cells]]. The hijackers diverted the flight to [[Benghazi]], Libya.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entebbe's unsung hero.&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3270314,00.html|title=Special: Entebbe's unsung hero.|last=Ben|first=Eyal|date=3 July 2006|work=Ynetnews|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There it was held on the ground for seven hours for refuelling. During that time the hijackers released British-born Israeli citizen Patricia Martell who pretended to have a [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mossad took photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Entebbe Thirty Years On&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jewishtelegraph.com/enteb_2.html|title=Entebbe Thirty Years On: Mancunian On Board|work=Jewish Telegraph|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane left Benghazi, and at 3:15&amp;nbsp;pm on the 28th, more than 24 hours after the flight's original departure, it arrived at [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]] in Uganda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entebbe's unsung hero.&quot; /&gt;

=== Hostage situation at Entebbe airport ===
At Entebbe, the four hijackers were joined by at least four others, supported by the forces of Uganda's President, [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_2786000/2786967.stm |title=1976: Israelis rescue Entebbe hostages |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 December 2012 |archivedate=27 December 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DE7fZYVd |deadurl=no |date=4 July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hijackers transferred the passengers to the transit hall of the disused former airport terminal where they kept them under guard for the following days. Amin came to visit the hostages almost on a daily basis, updating them on developments and promising his efforts in having them freed through negotiations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenkovitch&quot;/&gt;

On 28 June, a PFLP-EO hijacker issued a declaration and formulated their demands: In addition to a ransom of $5 million USD for the release of the airplane, they demanded the release of 53 Palestinian and Pro-Palestinian militants, 40 of whom were prisoners in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunstan|first1=Simon|title=Entebbe: The Most Daring Raid of Israel's Special Forces|date=2011|publisher=Rosen|location=New York|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They threatened that if these demands were not met, they would begin to kill hostages on 1 July 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;Detailed Story&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19760713&amp;id=7-QhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OGcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3641,5254231|title=Detailed Story Of Dramatic Israeli Raid|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=13 July 1976|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Separation of hostages into two groups ===
On 29 June, after Ugandan soldiers had opened an entrance to a room next to the crowded waiting hall by destroying a separating wall, the hijackers separated the Israelis (including those holding dual citizenship) from the other hostages{{#tag:ref|Claims by various authors that the separation was made between Jews and non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1976 Operation Entebbe|url=http://www.idfblog.com/about-the-idf/history-of-the-idf/1976-operation-entebbe/|website=IDF blog|publisher=Israeli Defense Forces|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are in conflict with eyewitness accounts&lt;ref name=&quot;Freed Hostages Tell Their Story&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Freed Hostages Tell Their Story|url=http://www.jta.org/1976/07/02/archive/freed-hostages-tell-their-story|accessdate=23 September 2014|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=2 July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ofer1976&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moufflet&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moufflet|first1=Claude|title=Otages à Kampala|date=1976|publisher=Presses de la Cité|page=82|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Epstein&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jerozolimski|first1=Ana|title=Ada Lazarovitz (46), que hace 30 años fuera una de las rehenes en el avión de Air France secuestrado por terroristas en Entebbe, recuerda su liberación.|url=http://letras-uruguay.espaciolatino.com/jerozolimski/ada_lazarovitz_46.htm|website=Espacio Latino|publisher=Semanario Hebreo|accessdate=23 September 2014|language=Spanish|date=13 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were later expressly disclaimed as a &quot;myth&quot; or a manipulation by &quot;sensation-hungry journalists and film-makers&quot; by several former hostages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartuv&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenkovitch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldberg/&gt; |group=&quot;nb&quot;|name=&quot;SeparationNote&quot;}} and told them to move to the adjoining room.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ofer1976&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Yehuda Ofer|title=Operation Thunder: The Entebbe Raid.

=== Releases of most non-Israeli hostages ===
On 30 June, the hijackers released 48 hostages picked from among the non-Israeli group – mainly elderly and sick passengers and mothers with children. Forty-seven of them were flown to Paris, and one passenger was treated in hospital for a day. On 1 July, after the Israeli government had conveyed its agreement to negotiations, the hostage-takers extended their deadline to noon on 4 July and released another group of 100 non-Israeli captives who again were flown to Paris a few hours later. Among the 106 hostages staying behind with their captors at Entebbe airport were the 12 members of the Air France crew, about ten young French passengers, and the Israeli group of some 84 people.&lt;ref name=MHS /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hostages freed as israelis raid uganda airport&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Entebbe's unsung hero.&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Entebbe Rescue Mission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/entebbe.html|title=The Entebbe Rescue Mission|work=Israel Defense Forces|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational planning==
In the week before the raid, Israel tried using political avenues to obtain the release of the hostages. Many sources indicate that the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] was prepared to release Palestinian prisoners if a military solution seemed unlikely to succeed. A retired IDF officer, Baruch &quot;Burka&quot; Bar-Lev, had known Idi Amin for many years and was considered to have a strong personal relationship with him. At the request of the cabinet, he spoke with Amin on the phone many times, trying to gain the release of the hostages, without success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914380,00.html &quot;Vindication for the Israelis&quot;].

''Time''. 26 July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli government also approached the United States government to deliver a message to Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]], asking him to request Amin to release the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS%5Ckissinger%5C0000C08F.pdf |title=Conversation between Henry Kissinger and Israeli Ambassador Simch Dinitz, 30 June 1976 |format=PDF |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1 July deadline,&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, Paul. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00712F7355E1A738DDDA90B94DF405B868BF1D3 &quot;Rescuing the Entebbe Hostages&quot;]. ''The New York Times''. Friday, 30 July 1976. (The Weekend, p. 51).&lt;/ref&gt; the Israeli cabinet offered to negotiate with the hijackers to extend the deadline to 4 July. Amin also asked them to extend the deadline until that date. This meant he could take a diplomatic trip to [[Port Louis]], Mauritius, to officially hand over chairmanship of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] to [[Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].&lt;ref&gt;Lipkin-Shakhak, Tali.

Historama. 16 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This extension of the hostage deadline proved crucial to providing Israeli forces enough time to get to [[Entebbe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;General Dan Shomron&quot; /&gt;

On 3 July, at 18:30, the Israeli cabinet approved a rescue mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60816FA38591B728DDDAD0894DF405B868BF1D3|title=Hostages Freed as Israelis Raid Uganda Airport |last=Terence|first=Smith | work=The New York Times | date=4 July 1976 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented by [[Aluf|Major General]] [[Yekutiel Adam|Yekutiel &quot;Kuti&quot; Adam]] and [[Dan Shomron|Brig.

===Attempts at a diplomatic solution===
As the crisis unfolded, attempts were made to negotiate the release of the hostages. According to declassified diplomatic documents, the Egyptian government under Sadat tried to negotiate with both the PLO and the Ugandan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=172177&amp;dt=2082&amp;dl=1345 |title=Herman Eilts (US Ambassador to Egypt) to Secretary of State, 6 July 1976 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=181803&amp;dt=2082&amp;dl=1345 |title=Herman Eilts (US Ambassador to Egypt) to Secretary of State, 9 July 1976 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; PLO chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] sent his political aide [[Hani al-Hassan]] to Uganda as a special envoy to negotiate with the hostage takers and with Amin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartuv&quot;/&gt; However, the PFLP-EO hijackers refused to see him.&lt;ref name=NouvelObs&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chabalier|first1=Hervé|title=Israël: le prix d'un exploit |newspaper=Le Nouvel Observateur |date=12 July 1976 |page=25 |url=http://referentiel.nouvelobs.com/archives_pdf/OBS0609_19760712/OBS0609_19760712_025.pdf |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raid preparation===
When Israeli authorities failed to negotiate a political solution, they decided the only option was an attack to rescue the hostages. Lt. Col. [[Joshua Shani]], lead pilot of the operation, later said that the Israelis had initially conceived of a rescue plan that involved dropping naval commandos into [[Lake Victoria]]. The commandos would have ridden rubber boats to the airport located on the edge of the lake. They planned to kill the hijackers and after freeing the hostages, ask Amin for passage home. The Israelis abandoned this plan because they lacked the time necessary and also received word that Lake Victoria was infested with crocodiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Israel Defense Forces: A People's Army |last=Williams |first=Louis |year=2000 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9780595143535 |page=131 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSsxPDuQy8YC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22rubber+boats%22+Entebbe+%22Lake+Victoria%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BdA0hBNs_o&amp;sig=JkbU0-_FMzHrQ-p5IVXLN_mmrb0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vl3cUNLvCcTC2QWaloCQBg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rubber%20boats%22%20Entebbe%20%22Lake%20Victoria%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aircraft refuelling====
While planning the raid, the Israeli forces had to plan how to refuel the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] aircraft they intended to use while en route to Entebbe. The Israelis lacked the logistical capacity to [[Aerial refueling|aerially refuel]] four to six aircraft so far from Israeli airspace. While several [[East Africa]]n nations, including the logistically preferred choice Kenya, were sympathetic, none wished to incur the wrath of Amin or the Palestinians by allowing the Israelis to land their aircraft within their borders.

The raid could not proceed without assistance from at least one East African government. The Jewish owner of the Block hotels chain in Kenya, along with other members of the Jewish and Israeli community in [[Nairobi]], may have used their political and economic influence to help persuade Kenya's President [[Jomo Kenyatta]] to help Israel. The Israeli government secured permission from Kenya for the IDF task force to cross Kenyan airspace and refuel at what is today [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Entebbe: The Most Daring Raid of Israel's Special Forces |last=Dunstan |first=Simon |year=2011 |publisher=Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=9781448818686 |page=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrL9bHLpOq4C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Entebbe+%22Jomo+Kenyatta+airport%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VGrcUNlRxbvZBfvMgdAI&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Entebbe%20%22Jomo%20Kenyatta%20airport%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenyan [[Ministry of Agriculture (Kenya)|Minister of Agriculture]] [[Bruce Mackenzie (British intelligence operative)|Bruce MacKenzie]] persuaded Kenyan President Kenyatta to permit Mossad to collect intelligence prior to the operation, and to allow the [[Israeli Air Force]] access to the Nairobi airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Melman |first=Yossi |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Analysis-Israel-and-Kenya-blood-ties-326880 |title=A history of cooperation between Israel and Kenya |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, Ugandan President Idi Amin ordered Ugandan agents to assassinate MacKenzie. He was killed on 24 May 1978 when a bomb attached to his aircraft exploded.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAar3TpYOt4C&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=israel+kenya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G45DUoO4FJPa4AO9noGgDg&amp;ved=0CHkQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=israel%20kenya&amp;f=false |author=Ephraim Kahana |title=Historical Dictionary of Israeli Intelligence |publisher= |year=2006 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;standardmedia1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000042641&amp;pageNo=1 |title=Ugandan agents killed former Cabinet minister, says dossier |publisher=Standard Digital News |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrL9bHLpOq4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=bruce+mackenzie+May+24,+1978&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gay4o2OJzA&amp;sig=3xduzFuGBsBYYAHlklRMQgeZWNY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pZRDUo6HCu7G4AObxYDQAg&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bruce%20mackenzie%20May%2024%2C%201978&amp;f=false |title=Entebbe: The Most Daring Raid of Israel's Special Forces – Simon Dunstan |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Mossad Chief Director [[Meir Amit]] had a forest planted in Israel in MacKenzie's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost1&quot;/&gt;

====Hostage intelligence====
Mossad built an accurate picture of the whereabouts of the hostages, the number of hijackers, and the involvement of Ugandan troops from the released hostages in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeMagazine&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914272,00.html|title=The Rescue: 'We Do the Impossible' |date=12 July 1976|work=Time|accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Israeli firms were involved in building projects in Africa during the 1960s and 1970s and while preparing the raid the Israeli army consulted with [[Solel Boneh]], a large Israeli construction company that had built the terminal where the hostages were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wars and Operations: Operation Thunderball (&quot;Entebbe&quot;)|url=http://www.iaf.org.il/4694-33040-he/IAF.aspx|publisher=[[Israel Air Force]](official website)|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; While planning the military operation the IDF erected a partial replica of the airport terminal with the assistance of civilians who had helped build the original.

Muki Betzer said in a later interview that Mossad operatives extensively interviewed the hostages who had been released. He said that a French-Jewish passenger who had a military background and &quot;a phenomenal memory&quot; provided detailed information about the number of weapons carried by the hostage-takers.&lt;ref name=&quot;betzer&quot;&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-04-palestinian-pressure_x.htm &quot;Israel marks 30th anniversary of Entebbe&quot;]. Associated Press in ''USA Today''. 5 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After Betzer collected intelligence and planned for several days, four Israeli Air Force C-130 Hercules transport aircraft secretly flew to Entebbe Airport at midnight without being detected by Entebbe air traffic control.

===Task force===
The Israeli ground task force numbered approximately 100 personnel, and comprised the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;ediary&quot; /&gt;
; The ground command and control element
:This small group comprised the operation and overall ground commander, [[Dan Shomron|Brigadier General Dan Shomron]], the air force representative [[Ami Ayalon|Col. Ami Ayalon]] and the communications and support personnel.
; The assault element
:A 29-man assault unit led by Lt. Col. [[Yonatan Netanyahu]] – this force was composed entirely of commandos from [[Sayeret Matkal]], and was given the primary task of assaulting the old terminal and rescuing the hostages. Major Betser led one of the element's assault teams, and took command after Lt. Col. Netanyahu was killed.
; The securing element
:# The [[Paratroopers Brigade|Paratroopers]] force led by [[Matan Vilnai|Col. Matan Vilnai]] – tasked with securing the civilian airport field, clearing and securing the runways, and protection and fuelling of the Israeli aircraft in Entebbe.
:# The [[Golani Brigade|Golani]] force led by [[Uri Sagi|Col. Uri Sagi]] – tasked with securing the C-130 Hercules aircraft for the hostages' evacuation, getting it as close as possible to the terminal and boarding the hostages; also with acting as general reserves.
:# The [[Sayeret Matkal]] force led by [[Shaul Mofaz|Major Shaul Mofaz]] – tasked with clearing the military airstrip, and destroying the squadron of MiG fighter jets on the ground, to prevent any possible interceptions by the [[Uganda People's Defence Force|Ugandan Air Force]]; also with holding off hostile [[ground forces]] from the city of Entebbe.

==Raid==
[[File:Entebbe Aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of the city of [[Entebbe]] and the [[Entebbe International Airport]] at sunset]]

===Attack route===
Taking off from [[Sharm el-Sheikh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/entebbi_eng.htm|title=Operation Entebbe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the task force flew along the international flight path over the [[Red Sea]], mostly flying at a height of no more than 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) to avoid radar detection by Egyptian, Sudanese, and Saudi Arabian forces. Near the south outlet of the Red Sea the C-130s turned south and passed south of [[Djibouti]]. From there, they went to a point northeast of Nairobi, Kenya, likely across Somalia and the [[Ogaden]] area of Ethiopia. They turned west, passing through the [[East African Rift|African Rift Valley]] and over Lake Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ninety Minutes at Entebbe&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=William|title=Ninety Minutes at Entebbe|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|year=1976|page=100|isbn=0-553-10482-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Boeing 707]] jets followed the cargo planes. The first Boeing contained medical facilities and landed at [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] in Nairobi, Kenya. The commander of the operation, General Yekutiel Adam, was on board the second Boeing, which circled over Entebbe Airport during the raid.&lt;ref name=&quot;ediary&quot; /&gt;

The Israeli forces landed at Entebbe on 3 July at 23:00 [[Israel Standard Time|IST]], with their [[cargo bay]] doors already open. A black [[Mercedes-Benz 600|Mercedes]] car that looked like President Idi Amin's vehicle and [[Land Rover]]s that usually accompanied Amin's Mercedes were brought along. The Israelis hoped they could use them to bypass security checkpoints. When the C-130s landed, Israeli assault team members drove the vehicles to the terminal building in the same fashion as Amin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Back to Entebbe&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Larry Domnitch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/39910/ |title=Remembering Entebbe,Larry Domnitch |date=1 July 2009 |publisher=The Jewish Press |accessdate=4 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323123727/http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/39910 |archivedate=23 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they approached the terminal, two Ugandan sentries, aware that Idi Amin had recently purchased a white Mercedes, ordered the vehicles to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=30529 |title=A historic hostage-taking revisited |author=David E.

===Hostage rescue===

The Israelis sprang from their vehicles and burst towards the terminal. The hostages were in the main hall of the airport building, directly adjacent to the runway. Entering the terminal, the commandos shouted through a megaphone, &quot;Stay down! Stay down! We are Israeli soldiers,&quot; in both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and English. Jean-Jacques Maimoni, a 19-year-old French immigrant to Israel, stood up and was killed when Israeli company commander Muki Betzer and another soldier mistook him for a hijacker and fired at him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entebbe's unsung hero.&quot; /&gt; Another hostage, Pasco Cohen, 52, the manager of an Israeli medical insurance fund, was also fatally wounded by gunfire from the commandos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalemdiaries.com/article/6 |title=Remembering Entebbe |publisher=Jerusalem Diaries |date=3 July 2001 |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a third hostage, 56-year-old Ida Borochovitch, a Russian Jew who had [[Aliyah|emigrated to Israel]], was killed by a hijacker in the crossfire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bacos, 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berg|first1=Raffi|title=Entebbe pilot Michel Bacos 'saw hostage murdered'|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36584346|accessdate=3 July 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to hostage Ilan Hartuv, [[Wilfried Böse]] was the only hijacker who, after the operation began, entered the hall housing the hostages. At first he pointed his [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] rifle at hostages, but &quot;immediately came to his senses&quot; and ordered them to find shelter in the restroom, before being killed by the commandos. According to Hartuv, Böse fired only at Israeli soldiers and not at hostages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartuv&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/setting-the-record-straight-entebbe-was-not-auschwitz-1.372131 |title=Setting the record straight: Entebbe was not Auschwitz |author=Yossi Melman |date=8 July 2011 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=27 December 2012 |archivedate=27 December 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DE5G4iCG |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure===

After the raid, the Israeli assault team returned to their aircraft and began loading the hostages. Ugandan soldiers shot at them in the process. The Israeli commandos returned fire with their [[Assault rifles|AK47]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Israeli Special Forces Database|url=http://www.isayeret.com/content/weapons/assault/ak/article.shtml|website=isayeret.com|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; inflicting casualties on the Ugandans.

==Aftermath==
The [[United Nations Security Council]] convened on 9 July 1976, to consider a complaint from the Chairman of the [[Organization of African Unity]] charging Israel with an &quot;act of aggression&quot;.&lt;ref name=SC1939/&gt; The Council allowed Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, [[Chaim Herzog]], and Uganda's foreign minister, [[Juma Oris|Juma Oris Abdalla]], to participate without voting rights.&lt;ref name=SC1939/&gt; UN Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]] told the Security Council that the raid was &quot;a serious violation of the sovereignty of a Member State of the United Nations&quot; though he was &quot;fully aware that this is not the only element involved ... when the world community is now required to deal with unprecedented problems arising from international terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref name=SC1939&gt;Security Council, Official Records, 1939th meeting, 9 July 1976, S/PV.1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Abdalla, the representative of Uganda, alleged that the affair was close to a peaceful resolution when Israel intervened while Herzog, the representative of Israel, accused Uganda of direct complicity in the hijacking.&lt;ref name=SC1939/&gt; The US and UK sponsored a resolution which condemned hijacking and similar acts, deplored the loss of life arising from the hijacking (without condemning either Israel or Uganda), reaffirmed the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States, and called on the international community to enhance the safety of civil aviation.&lt;ref&gt;Security Council. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America: draft resolution. Document S/12138, 12 July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the resolution failed to receive the required number of affirmative votes due to 2 abstentions and 7 absences.&lt;ref name=SC1943&gt;Security Council, Official Records, 1943th meeting, 14 July 1976, S/PV.1943, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A second resolution sponsored by Benin, Libya and Tanzania, that condemned Israel, was not put to the vote.&lt;ref name=SC1943/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security Council.

Western nations spoke in support of the raid. West Germany called the raid &quot;an act of self-defence&quot;. Switzerland and France praised the operation. Representatives of the United Kingdom and United States offered significant praise, calling the Entebbe raid &quot;an impossible operation&quot;. Some in the United States noted that the hostages were freed on 4 July 1976, 200 years after the signing of the US declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7340000/newsid_7349900/7349983.stm?bw=nb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1&amp;ms3=6&amp;ms_javascript=true&amp;bbcws=2 | title=Age of Terror: Episode one | date=16 April 2008 | publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3525616,00.html |title=עכשיו, במבצע – תרבות ובידור |publisher=Ynet |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mota.co.il/antebe.htm |title=מבצע אנטבה |publisher=Mota.co.il |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In private conversation with Israeli Ambassador Dinitz, [[Henry Kissinger]] sounded criticism for Israeli use of US equipment during the operation, but that criticism was not made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia.state.gov/documents/Kissinger/0000BE67.pdf |title=Conversation between Kissinger and Dinitz, 5 July 1976 |format=PDF |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-July 1976, the supercarrier {{USS|Ranger|CV-61}} and her escorts entered the Indian Ocean and operated off the Kenyan coast in response to a threat of military action by forces from Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ussranger.org/home/ranger-history USS ''Ranger'' Bicentennial Cruise Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing years, Betser and the Netanyahu brothers – [[Iddo Netanyahu|Iddo]] and [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Benjamin]], all [[Sayeret Matkal]] veterans – argued in increasingly public forums about who was to blame for the unexpected early firefight that caused Yonatan's death and partial loss of tactical surprise.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Roffe-Ofir [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3270234,00.html &quot;Entebbe's open wound&quot;] ''Ynet'', 7 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josh Hamerman [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3384084,00.html &quot;Battling against 'the falsification of history'&quot;] Ynetnews, 4 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemorations==
In August 2012, Uganda and Israel commemorated the raid at a sombre ceremony at the base of a tower at the Old Entebbe Airport, where Yonatan Netanyahu was killed. Uganda and Israel renewed their commitment in the fight against terrorism and to work towards humanity. In addition, wreaths were laid, a moment of silence was held, speeches were given, and a poem was recited. The flags of Uganda and Israel waved side by side, demonstrating the two countries' strong bilateral relations, next to a plaque bearing a history of the raid. The ceremony was attended by Ugandan State Minister for Animal Industry [[Bright Rwamirama]] and the deputy [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel]] [[Daniel Ayalon]], who laid wreaths at the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uganda Israel 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/634093-Uganda--Israel-honor-1976-Entebbe-raid.html |title=Uganda, Israel honor 1976 Entebbe raid |publisher=New Vision |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |author=Candia, Steven |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815235504/http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/634093-Uganda--Israel-honor-1976-Entebbe-raid.html |archivedate=15 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years to the day after the rescue operation, Israeli Prime-Minister, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], and brother of the slain Israeli ''[[Sayeret Matkal]]'' commando, [[Yoni Netanyahu]], visited Entebbe with an Israeli delegation, and laid the groundwork for further Israeli–sub-Saharan African bilateral relations.
