==Baka Bomb Source==
I noticed that an unreliable source tag was put on the &quot;baka bomb&quot; nickname. In this documentary a veteran whose ship was attacked by one refers to them as such. Would this be considered reliable?

==USS Stanly==
Does anyone know more about the USS Stanly? A ship hit by two kamikaze planes, which apparently survived the attack. Sounds interesting![[User:Doovinator|Doovinator]] 19:03, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)

==Multiple Model 11s==
Just FYI, there are multiple Model 11's that purport to be I-13.  Locations:
* serial number 1081 put on display at the defunct Victory Air Museum, Ivanhoe, IL according to [http://www.j-aircraft.com/faq/MxY.htm#Japanese Navy Aircraft Ohka Markings]
*USMC Air Ground Museum, Quantico, VA according to picture at http://www.preservedaxisaircraft.com/Japan/Yokosuka/Yokosuka.htm
*RAFM Cosford according to picture on http://www.preservedaxisaircraft.com/Japan/Yokosuka/Yokosuka.htm  Serial number is shown as 1046 according to [http://www.j-aircraft.com/walk/Graham_Causer/Ohka/Cosford%20027.jpg J-Aircraft research site photo.]

The March 21, 1945 entry under Operational History says &quot;16 Ohka-carrying mother ships...&quot; but at the end says &quot;160 of the Jinrai Butai are dead&quot;. I'm guessing that's a typo for 16 and am changing it. [[User:Kaleja|Kaleja]] 20:42, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

Here's a picture of my grandfather taken with an Ohka in Japan right after Japan surrendered.

== speed ==

It doesn't seem to mention anywhere that these things were capable of going at up to 600 mph at a target.  Which, when you think about it, is approx. a mile every ten seconds.  I'll add that in somewhere later.

Cam 21:08, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

: 600 mph is a mile every six seconds, I believe. But doesn't this page list the top speed as 390 mph? Sources, anyone? [[User:Jodamn|Jodamn]] 02:25, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

:: The Display at the Fleet Air Arm Museum states 580mph. [[Special:Contributions/82.26.195.247|82.26.195.247]] ([[User talk:82.26.195.247|talk]]) 17:00, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

== Trivial Facts ==
Maybe it's just me, or not, so I'd like to ask. Does Trivial Facts section add any insightful or meaningful addition to the overall topic? Personally I came to read about Ohka out of personal interest, because I am interested in WWII war machines of various sorts, also  had relatives who were part of this horrible event in history. Article itself was well written I thought, until I came upon this section. Seriously, I strongly felt that connecting this real suicide war machine to some fictional anime character greatly undermines the integrity of this topic. Although it is my personal opinion and I would prefer someone would comment on it, until then on my personal discretion, I would like to remove it. If others feel it right to keep this being mentioned, I would be glad to discuss this with an open mind. 13:04, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for taking out the Trivial Facts section. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 15:49, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

==Attitudes?==
Is the section on &quot;Differing attitudes&quot; appropriate for [[Ohka]]? It seems more suitable for [[kamikaze]] to me. --[[User:OGoncho|OGoncho]] ([[User talk:OGoncho|talk]]) 01:49, 5 February 2008 (UTC)
:I moved part of it into the introduction. IMO this paragraph does not merit its own section and most of it had no citation. Furthermore, it said &quot;differing attitudes&quot; but only the Japanese's views were given. --[[User:Mizst|Mizst]] ([[User talk:Mizst|talk]]) 12:34, 4 July 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;Aircontent&quot; template is broken ==

I noticed that the &quot;[[Template:Install Aircontent|aircontent]]&quot; template in the &quot;See also&quot; section is broken.  The &quot;|sequence=&quot; entries are not appearing on the page. --[[Special:Contributions/70.149.84.150|70.149.84.150]] ([[User talk:70.149.84.150|talk]]) 02:18, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

==Doesn't add up==
Something doesn't add up: &quot;. It appears that the operational record of Ohkas used in action includes three ships sunk or damaged beyond repair and three other ships with significant damage. Seven US ships were damaged or sunk by Ohkas throughout the war.&quot;  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/173.52.148.120|173.52.148.120]] ([[User talk:173.52.148.120|talk]]) 03:15, 16 July 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Production figures ==
The table states 850, but the text states 750.

== Trinitroaminol? ==

What substance is this? The US Army Encyclopedia of Explosives and Related Items does not know it. The Internet itself does not know it as well, if we filter out all the hits that are related to Ohkas. --[[User:Shaddack|Shaddack]] ([[User talk:Shaddack|talk]]) 19:13, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

:That should have been [[Ammonal]]. Sorry for the confusion. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 20:12, 22 September 2009 (UTC)
