'''''D-Day the Sixth of June''''' is a [[1956 in film|1956]] [[romance film|romantic]] [[CinemaScope]] [[war film]] made by [[20th Century Fox]]. It was directed by [[Henry Koster]] and produced by [[Charles Brackett]] from a [[screenplay]] by Ivan Moffat and [[Harry Brown (writer)|Harry Brown]], based on the novel, ''The Sixth of June'' by [[Lionel Shapiro]].

The film stars [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], [[Richard Todd]] (who participated in the [[Normandy landings]] in real life), [[Dana Wynter]], and [[Edmond O'Brien]].

==Plot==

A few hours before [[D-Day]], Special Force Six embarks to destroy an especially well-defended German gun emplacement on the [[Normandy]] coast. As the ship steams towards it, the officers and men recall what circumstances brought them there, especially Wynter and Parker.

Captain Brad Parker, an American paratrooper invalided out because of a broken leg suffered during a [[parachute]] jump is posted to the headquarters of the [[European Theatre of Operations]] in London. At the [[Red Cross]] club, he meets and, despite being married, falls in love with Valerie Russell, a [[Women's Royal Army Corps]] [[subaltern]]. Valerie is the daughter of a crusty [[Brigadier]] who's been on sick leave since being wounded at [[Dunkirk]]. Valerie is also already in love with Captain John Wynter of the [[British Commandos]], a friend of her father.

Both officers are posted overseas, but later return. Parker has volunteered to join what becomes Special Force Six, to be led by his former commander, Lt. Colonel (now Colonel) Timmer.

With only a few hours before the operation is due to embark, Timmer goes to pieces (partly as a result of his earlier bad experiences in the failed [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime#Second World War|Dieppe]] landing) and is arrested whilst drunk and breaking security. Wynter, now a Colonel, who has recovered from being badly wounded, is brought in to command the operation.

The operation is a success, despite several killed and wounded. Wynter is killed when he steps on a [[Land mine|mine]]. Parker is badly wounded and evacuated.

In hospital, and due to be repatriated, he sees Valerie for the last time. She does not tell him that Wynter has been killed.

==Production==
Lionel Shapiro (1908â€“1958) was a Canadian [[war correspondent]] for ''[[The Montreal Gazette]]'' who landed at the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]] and [[Juno Beach]] on D-Day with the Canadian forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,807462,00.html Books: Love Before D-Day - TIME]&lt;/ref&gt; His 1955 romantic novel ''The Sixth of June'' was awarded the [[Governor General's Award for English language fiction]]. As opposed to a historical account such as ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'', ''The Sixth of June'' is a [[love triangle]] of [[adulterous]] relationships set in war such as ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' that was also filmed by [[20th Century Fox]] in [[1956 in film|1956]]. Robert Taylor echoes his appearance in ''[[Waterloo Bridge (1940 film)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' by wearing a [[trenchcoat]] and romancing English lady Dana Wynter. Wynter called it her favourite of all her films, being an unresolved love story.&lt;ref&gt;p.303 Weaver, Tom ''I Was a Monster Movie Maker'' 2001 McFarland&lt;/ref&gt;

Though originally planned to be filmed in England with [[Jean Simmons]] as the female lead, ''The Sixth of June'' (the [[working title]] of the film) was made on the Fox [[backlot]] with naval scenes filmed at the [[Long Beach Naval Shipyard]] whilst the beach landing was made at [[Point Dume]] California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=72073&amp;category=Notes D-Day the Sixth of June (1956) - Overview - TCM.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the days of [[computer-generated imagery]] director [[Henry Koster]] had to make his landing look convincing on his limited budget with two [[LCVP (United States)|LCVPs]] and eighty soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;p.20 Davis, Ronald L. ''Just Making Movies: Company Directors on the Studio System'' 2005 University of Mississippi Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the invasion scene soldiers running out of the two landing craft appear in front of a back projection scene of another take of the same scene giving the appearance of twice as many landing craft and soldiers as there actually were.

Unlike many American [[war film]]s ''D-Day the Sixth of June'' presents the viewpoints of British characters and features Canadian troops in action. The film's microcosm version of the [[Normandy landings]] is a [[Pointe du Hoc]] type assault featuring an imaginary &quot;Special Force Six&quot; made up of [[United Kingdom|British]], [[United States|American]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] troops in equal quantities. When Taylor's character is wounded it is Todd and the British and Canadians who destroy the big gun that is the force's objective.

Edmond O'Brien's character is relieved of command in a similarity to [[US Army Ranger]] Major Cleveland A Lytle. Lytle who was to command three companies of the [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Ranger Battalion]] in the assault at Pointe du Hoc heard that [[Free French]] sources reported the guns thought to be there had been removed.  Lytle became quite vocal that the assault would be unnecessary and suicidal and was relieved of his command at the last minute by Provisional Ranger Force commander Colonel [[James Rudder]].&lt;ref&gt;p.78 Black, Colonel Robert W. ''The Battalion: The Dramatic Story of the 2nd Ranger Battalion in World War II'' 2006 Stackpole Books&lt;/ref&gt; Rudder felt that Lytle could not convincingly lead a force with a mission that he did not believe in.&lt;ref&gt;p.210 Gawne, Jonathan ''Spearheading D-Day: American Special Units 6 June 1944'' 2001 Historie and Collections&lt;/ref&gt; Lytle was later transferred to the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Infantry Division]] where he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legionofvalor.com/citation_parse.php?uid=1032886021 Legion of Valor Recipient]&lt;/ref&gt;
