'''Victoria''' (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819&amp;nbsp;– 22 January 1901) was [[Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of [[Empress of India]].

Victoria was the daughter of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], the fourth son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]. She inherited the throne aged 18, after her father's three elder brothers had all died, leaving no surviving legitimate children. The United Kingdom was already an established [[constitutional monarchy]], in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power. Privately, Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality.

Victoria married her first cousin, [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], in 1840. Their [[#Issue|nine children]] married into royal and noble families across the continent, tying them together and earning her the sobriquet &quot;the grandmother of Europe&quot;. After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republicanism]] temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered. Her [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden]] and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration.

Her reign of [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|63 years and seven months]] is known as the [[Victorian era]]. It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the [[British Empire]]. She was the last [[British monarch]] of the [[House of Hanover]]. Her son and successor, [[Edward VII]], belonged to the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], the line of his father.

==Birth and family==
[[File:Denning, Stephen Poyntz - Princess Victoria aged Four - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Victoria aged 4|Victoria, aged four&lt;br /&gt;Painting by [[Stephen Poyntz Denning]], 1823]]
Victoria's father was [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom, [[George III]]. Until 1817, Edward's niece, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]], was the only legitimate grandchild of George III. Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children. In 1818 he married [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]], a widowed German princess with two children—[[Carl, 3rd Prince of Leiningen|Carl]] (1804–1856) and [[Princess Feodora of Leiningen|Feodora]] (1807–1872)—by her first marriage to the [[Emich Carl, 2nd Prince of Leiningen|Prince of Leiningen]]. Her brother [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold]] was Princess Charlotte's widower. The Duke and Duchess of Kent's only child, Victoria was born at 4.15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 24 May 1819 at [[Kensington Palace]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 3–12; Strachey, pp. 1–17; Woodham-Smith, pp. 15–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria was christened privately by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Manners-Sutton]], on 24 June 1819 in the Cupola Room at Kensington Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Her godparents were Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] (represented by her uncle the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]]), her uncle the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]], her aunt [[Charlotte, Princess Royal|Queen Charlotte of Württemberg]] (represented by Victoria's aunt [[Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom|Princess Augusta]]) and Victoria's maternal grandmother the [[Countess Augusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf|Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (represented by Victoria's aunt [[Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh]]).&lt;/ref&gt; She was baptised ''Alexandrina'', after one of her godparents, Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]], and ''Victoria'' after her mother. Additional names proposed by her parents—Georgina (or Georgiana), Charlotte, and Augusta—were dropped on the instructions of the Duke's elder brother, the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] (later George IV).&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 12–13; Longford, p. 23; Woodham-Smith, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

At birth, Victoria was fifth in the line of succession after her father and his three older brothers: the Prince Regent, the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]], and the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]] (later William IV).&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince Regent and the Duke of York were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children. The Dukes of Kent and Clarence married on the same day 12 months before Victoria's birth, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820 respectively) died as infants. Victoria's grandfather and father died in 1820, within a week of each other, and the Duke of York died in 1827. On the death of her uncle George IV in 1830, Victoria became [[heir presumptive]] to her next surviving uncle, William IV. The [[Regency Act 1830]] made special provision for the Duchess of Kent to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 31; St Aubyn, p. 26; Woodham-Smith, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a [[regency]] could be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 46; Longford, p. 54; St Aubyn, p. 50; Waller, p. 344; Woodham-Smith, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heir presumptive==
[[File:Princess Victoria and Dash by George Hayter.jpg|thumb|left|Victoria with her spaniel Dash, 1833&lt;br /&gt;Painting by [[George Hayter]]]]
Victoria later described her childhood as &quot;rather melancholy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 19; Marshall, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called &quot;[[Kensington System]]&quot;, an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering [[comptroller]], Sir [[John Conroy]], who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 27; Longford, pp. 35–38, 118–119; St Aubyn, pp. 21–22; Woodham-Smith, pp. 70–72. The rumours were false in the opinion of these biographers.&lt;/ref&gt; The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 27–28; Waller, pp. 341–342; Woodham-Smith, pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's illegitimate children,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 32–33; Longford, pp. 38–39, 55; Marshall, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps prompted the emergence of [[Victorian morality]] by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Lacey|Lacey, Robert]] (2006) ''Great Tales from English History, Volume 3'', London: Little, Brown, and Company, ISBN 0-316-11459-6, pp. 133–136&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her [[King Charles spaniel]], [[Dash (spaniel)|Dash]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller, pp. 338–341; Woodham-Smith, pp. 68–69, 91&lt;/ref&gt; Her lessons included French, German, Italian, and Latin,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 18; Longford, p. 31; Woodham-Smith, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; but she spoke only English at home.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 31; Woodham-Smith, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victoria sketch 1835.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Victoria's sketch of herself|Self-portrait, 1835]]
In 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the [[Malvern Hills]], stopping at towns and great [[English country houses|country house]]s along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 35–39; Woodham-Smith, pp. 88–89, 102&lt;/ref&gt; William compared the journeys to [[royal progress]]es and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 36; Woodham-Smith, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little time for her to rest.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 35–40; Woodham-Smith, pp. 92, 102&lt;/ref&gt; She objected on the grounds of the King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy, and forced Victoria to continue the tours.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 38–39; Longford, p. 47; Woodham-Smith, pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Ramsgate]] in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever,&lt;!--Longford and Marshall says typhoid; Hibbert says maybe typhoid or tonsillitis; Woodham-Smith says probably tonsillitis and that biographer Sidney Lee was the first to say typhoid--&gt; which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 42; Woodham-Smith, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 42; Longford, pp. 47–48; Marshall, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 42, 50; Woodham-Smith, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Once queen, she banned him from her presence, but he remained in her mother's household.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 46; St Aubyn, p. 67; Waller, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1836, the Duchess's brother, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold]], who had been King of the Belgians since 1831, hoped to marry his niece to his nephew, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 29, 51; Waller, p. 363; Weintraub, pp. 43–49&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold, Victoria's mother, and Albert's father ([[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]) were siblings. Leopold arranged for Victoria's mother to invite her Coburg relatives to visit her in May 1836, with the purpose of introducing Victoria to Albert.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 51; Weintraub, pp. 43–49&lt;/ref&gt; William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of [[Prince Alexander of the Netherlands]], second son of [[William II of the Netherlands|the Prince of Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 51–52; St Aubyn, p. 43; Weintraub, pp. 43–49; Woodham-Smith, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, pp. 43–49&lt;/ref&gt; According to her diary, she enjoyed Albert's company from the beginning. After the visit she wrote, &quot;[Albert] is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Victoria quoted in Marshall, p. 27 and Weintraub, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, on the other hand, was &quot;very plain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria quoted in Hibbert, p. 99; St Aubyn, p. 43; Weintraub, p. 49 and Woodham-Smith, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria wrote to her uncle Leopold, whom Victoria considered her &quot;best and kindest adviser&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Victoria's journal, October 1835, quoted in St Aubyn, p. 36 and Woodham-Smith, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; to thank him &quot;for the prospect of ''great'' happiness you have contributed to give me, in the person of dear Albert&amp;nbsp;... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy. He is so sensible, so kind, and so good, and so amiable too. He has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 102; Marshall, p. 60; Waller, p. 363; Weintraub, p. 51; Woodham-Smith, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; However at 17, Victoria, though interested in Albert, was not yet ready to marry. The parties did not undertake a formal engagement, but assumed that the match would take place in due time.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, pp. 363–364; Weintraub, pp. 53, 58, 64, and 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign==
{{see also|Coronation of Queen Victoria}}

[[File:Victoriatothrone.jpg|alt=Drawing of two men on their knees in front of Victoria|thumb|left|Victoria receives the news of her accession from [[Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham|Lord Conyngham]] (left) and [[William Howley|the Archbishop of Canterbury]].]]

Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. On 20 June 1837, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] died at the age of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Under section 2 of the Regency Act 1830, the [[Accession Council]]'s proclamation declared Victoria as the King's successor &quot;saving the rights of any issue of His late Majesty King William the Fourth which may be borne of his late Majesty's Consort&quot;. {{London Gazette|issue=19509|date=20 June 1837|startpage=1581}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her diary she wrote, &quot;I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me [[William Howley|the Archbishop of Canterbury]] and [[Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham|Lord Conyngham]] were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my dressing gown) and ''alone'', and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that ''I'' am ''Queen''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, pp. 55–57; Woodham-Smith, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1714, Britain had shared a monarch with [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] in Germany, but under [[Salic law]] women were excluded from the Hanoverian succession. While Victoria inherited all the British dominions, Hanover passed instead to her father's younger brother, her unpopular uncle the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who became King [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover]]. He was her [[heir presumptive]] until she married and had a child.&lt;ref&gt;Packard, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dronning victoria.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation portrait by [[George Hayter]]]]

At the time of her accession, the government was led by the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] prime minister [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], who at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen, who relied on him for advice.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 66–69; St Aubyn, p. 76; Woodham-Smith, pp. 143–147&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was &quot;passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one&quot;, and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure.&lt;ref&gt;Greville quoted in Hibbert, p. 67; Longford, p. 70 and Woodham-Smith, p. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coronation of Queen Victoria|Her coronation]] took place on 28 June 1838 at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen Victoria's Coronation 1838|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/The%20Royal%20Collection%20and%20other%20collections/TheRoyalArchives/QueenVictoriaeducationproject/QueenVictoriasCoronation1838.aspx|publisher=The British Monarchy|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the first sovereign to take up residence at [[Buckingham Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 69; Waller, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; and inherited the revenues of the duchies of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]] as well as being granted a [[civil list]] allowance of £385,000 per year. Financially prudent, she paid off her father's debts.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 58; Longford, pp. 73–74; Woodham-Smith, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of her reign Victoria was popular,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 42; St Aubyn, pp. 63, 96&lt;/ref&gt; but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother's ladies-in-waiting, [[Lady Flora Hastings]], developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 47; Waller, p. 356; Woodham-Smith, pp. 164–166&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria believed the rumours.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 77–78; Longford, p. 97; St Aubyn, p. 97; Waller, p. 357; Woodham-Smith, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; She hated Conroy, and despised &quot;that odious Lady Flora&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Victoria's journal, 25 April 1838, quoted in Woodham-Smith, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the [[Kensington System]].&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 96; Woodham-Smith, pp. 162, 165&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Lady Flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination, until in mid-February she eventually agreed, and was found to be a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 79; Longford, p. 98; St Aubyn, p. 99; Woodham-Smith, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Conroy, the Hastings family and the opposition [[Tories]] organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 80–81; Longford, pp. 102–103; St Aubyn, pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; When Lady Flora died in July, the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 122; Marshall, p. 57; St Aubyn, p. 104; Woodham-Smith, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; At public appearances, Victoria was hissed and jeered as &quot;Mrs. Melbourne&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 83; Longford, pp. 120–121; Marshall, p. 57; St Aubyn, p. 105; Waller, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, Melbourne resigned after [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of [[Jamaica]]. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 107; Woodham-Smith, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir [[Robert Peel]], to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]], who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's [[Lady of the Bedchamber|ladies of the bedchamber]] were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the [[bedchamber crisis]], Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 94–96; Marshall, pp. 53–57; St Aubyn, pp. 109–112; Waller, pp. 359–361; Woodham-Smith, pp. 170–174&lt;/ref&gt;

Though queen, as an unmarried young woman Victoria was required by social convention to live with her mother, despite their differences over the Kensington System and her mother's continued reliance on Conroy.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 84; Marshall, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was consigned to a remote apartment in Buckingham Palace, and Victoria often refused to see her.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 72; Waller, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; When Victoria complained to Melbourne that her mother's close proximity promised &quot;torment for many years&quot;, Melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage, which Victoria called a &quot;schocking {{sic}} alternative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; She showed interest in Albert's education for the future role he would have to play as her husband, but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 103–104; Marshall, pp. 60–66; Weintraub, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria continued to praise Albert following his second visit in October 1839. Albert and Victoria felt mutual affection and the Queen proposed to him on 15 October 1839, just five days after he had arrived at Windsor.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 107–110; St Aubyn, pp. 129–132; Weintraub, pp. 77–81; Woodham-Smith, pp. 182–184, 187&lt;/ref&gt; They were married on 10 February 1840, in the [[Chapel Royal#The Chapel Royal St James's Palace|Chapel Royal]] of [[St James's Palace]], London. Victoria was besotted. She spent the evening after their wedding lying down with a headache, but wrote ecstatically in her diary:
{{Quote|I NEVER, NEVER spent such an evening!!! MY DEAREST DEAREST DEAR Albert&amp;nbsp;... his excessive love &amp; affection gave me feelings of heavenly love &amp; happiness I never could have ''hoped'' to have felt before! He clasped me in his arms, &amp; we kissed each other again &amp; again! His beauty, his sweetness &amp; gentleness – really how can I ever be thankful enough to have such a ''Husband''!&amp;nbsp;... to be called by names of tenderness, I have never yet heard used to me before – was bliss beyond belief! Oh! This was the happiest day of my life!&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 123; Longford, p. 143; Woodham-Smith, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Albert became an important political adviser as well as the Queen's companion, replacing Lord Melbourne as the dominant, influential figure in the first half of her life.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria's mother was evicted from the palace, to Ingestre House in [[Belgrave Square]]. After the death of [[Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom|Princess Augusta]] in 1840, Victoria's mother was given both [[Clarence House|Clarence]] and [[Frogmore House]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 265, Woodham-Smith, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Through Albert's mediation, relations between mother and daughter slowly improved.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 152; St Aubyn, pp. 174–175; Woodham-Smith, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edward Oxford shoots at H. M. the Queen, 1840.jpg|thumb|Contemporary lithograph of [[Edward Oxford]]'s attempt to assassinate Victoria, 1840]]
During Victoria's first pregnancy in 1840, in the first few months of the marriage, 18-year-old [[Edward Oxford]] attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He was tried for [[high treason]], found not guilty on the grounds of [[insanity defence|insanity]], and committed to an insane asylum indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 421–422; St Aubyn, pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the [[Lady Flora Hastings|Hastings]] affair and the [[bedchamber crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter, also named [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 130; Longford, p. 154; Marshall, p. 122; St Aubyn, p. 159; Woodham-Smith, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; viewed breast-feeding with disgust,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 149; St Aubyn, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; and thought newborn babies were ugly.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 149; Longford, p. 154; Marshall, p. 123; Waller, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]] (b. 1841), [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Alice]] (b. 1843), [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh|Alfred]] (b. 1844), [[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Helena]] (b. 1846), [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Louise]] (b. 1848), [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Arthur]] (b. 1850), [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Leopold]] (b. 1853) and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Beatrice]] (b. 1857).

Victoria's household was largely run by her childhood governess, [[Baroness Louise Lehzen]] from [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]]. Lehzen had been a formative influence on Victoria,&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; and had supported her against the Kensington System.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 56; St Aubyn, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Albert, however, thought Lehzen was incompetent, and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter's health. After a furious row between Victoria and Albert over the issue, Lehzen was pensioned off, and Victoria's close relationship with her ended.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 150–156; Marshall, p. 87; St Aubyn, pp. 171–173; Woodham-Smith, pp. 230–232&lt;/ref&gt;

==1842–1860==
[[File:Winterhalter - Queen Victoria 1843.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]], 1843]]
On 29 May 1842, Victoria was riding in a carriage along [[The Mall, London]], when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to [[Penal transportation|transportation for life]], John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, p. 51; Hibbert, pp. 422–423; St Aubyn, pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840.&lt;!--Hibbert, p. 423; St Aubyn, p. 163--&gt; Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 423; St Aubyn, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along [[Constitution Hill, London]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, [[Robert Pate]]. As Victoria was riding in a carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Melbourne's support in the House of Commons weakened through the early years of Victoria's reign, and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1841|1841 general election]] the Whigs were defeated. Peel became prime minister, and the [[Lady of the Bedchamber|ladies of the bedchamber]] most associated with the Whigs were replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 95–101; St Aubyn, pp. 153–155; Woodham-Smith, pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, Ireland was hit by a [[potato blight]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; In the next four years over a million Irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, Victoria was labelled &quot;The Famine Queen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The title of [[Maud Gonne]]'s 1900 article upon Queen Victoria's visit to Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Harrison, Shane|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2951395.stm | work=BBC News | title=Famine Queen row in Irish port | date=15 April 2003 | accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She personally donated £2,000 to the [[British Relief Association]], more than any other individual famine relief donor,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Private_Responses_to_the_Famine3344361812|title=Private Responses to the Famine|publisher=University College Cork|author=Kinealy, Christine|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also supported the [[Maynooth Grant]] to a Roman Catholic seminary in Ireland, despite Protestant opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The story that she donated only £5 in aid to the Irish, and on the same day gave the same amount to [[Battersea Dogs Home]], was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Mary (2009) ''Crown and Shamrock: Love and Hate Between Ireland and the British Monarchy'', Dublin: New Island, ISBN 1-905494-98-X&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1846, Peel's ministry faced a crisis involving the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]]. Many Tories—by then known also as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]—were opposed to the repeal, but Peel, some Tories (the &quot;Peelites&quot;), most Whigs and Victoria supported it. Peel resigned in 1846, after the repeal narrowly passed, and was replaced by [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Victorian Prime Ministers}}
Internationally, Victoria took a keen interest in the improvement of relations between France and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the [[House of Orleans]], who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King [[Louis Philippe I]] at [[château d'Eu]] in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Francis I of France]] on the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] in 1520.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 175, 187; St Aubyn, pp. 238, 241; Woodham-Smith, pp. 242, 250&lt;/ref&gt; When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Philippe was deposed in the [[revolutions of 1848]], and fled to exile in England.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 198; Longford, p. 194; St Aubyn, p. 243; Woodham-Smith, pp. 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of [[Osborne House]],&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 201–202; Marshall, p. 139; St Aubyn, pp. 222–223; Woodham-Smith, pp. 287–290&lt;/ref&gt; a private estate on the [[Isle of Wight]] that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 161–164; Marshall, p. 129; St Aubyn, pp. 186–190; Woodham-Smith, pp. 274–276&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations by [[Chartism|Chartists]] and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] failed to attract widespread support, and the scare died down without any major disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 196–197; St Aubyn, p. 223; Woodham-Smith, pp. 287–290&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success, but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 191; Woodham-Smith, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell's ministry, though Whig, was not favoured by the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; She found particularly offensive the [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], who often acted without consulting the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, or the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 196–198; St Aubyn, p. 244; Woodham-Smith, pp. 298–307&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge, but Palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative, despite her repeated remonstrances. It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government's approval of President [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's]] [[coup d'état|coup]] in France without consulting the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 204–209; Marshall, pp. 108–109; St Aubyn, pp. 244–254; Woodham-Smith, pp. 298–307&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III, by which time Russell's administration had been replaced by a short-lived minority government led by [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]].
[[File:Queen Victoria Prince Albert and their nine children.JPG|alt=Photograph of a seated Victoria, dressed in black, holding an infant with her children and Prince Albert standing around her|thumb|Albert, Victoria and their nine children, 1857. Left to right: Alice, Arthur, Albert, Edward, Leopold, Louise, Victoria with Beatrice, Alfred, Victoria and Helena]]
In 1853, Victoria gave birth to her eighth child, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Leopold]], with the aid of the new anaesthetic, [[chloroform]]. Victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child, [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Beatrice]], despite opposition from members of the clergy, who considered it against biblical teaching, and members of the medical profession, who thought it dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 216–217; St Aubyn, pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria may have suffered from [[postnatal depression]] after many of her pregnancies.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt; Letters from Albert to Victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control. For example, about a month after Leopold's birth Albert complained in a letter to Victoria about her &quot;continuance of hysterics&quot; over a &quot;miserable trifle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 217–220; Woodham-Smith, pp. 328–331&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1855, the government of [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], who had replaced Derby, fell amidst recriminations over the poor management of British troops in the [[Crimean War]]. Victoria approached both Derby and Russell to form a ministry, but neither had sufficient support, and Victoria was forced to appoint Palmerston as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 227–228; Longford, pp. 245–246; St Aubyn, p. 297; Woodham-Smith, pp. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon III, since the Crimean War Britain's closest ally,&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt; visited London in April 1855, and from 17 to 28 August the same year Victoria and Albert returned the visit.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, pp. 357–360&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon III met the couple at [[Dunkirk]] and accompanied them to Paris. They visited the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] (a successor to Albert's 1851 brainchild the [[Great Exhibition]]) and [[Napoleon I]]'s tomb at [[Les Invalides]] (to which his remains had only been [[retour des cendres|returned]] in 1840), and were guests of honour at a 1,200-guest ball at the [[Palace of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://en.chateauversailles.fr/history/the-significant-dates/most-important-dates/1855-visit-of-queen-victoria|title=1855 visit of Queen Victoria|publisher=Château de Versailles|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 1858, an Italian refugee from Britain called Orsini attempted to assassinate Napoleon III with a bomb made in England.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 241–242; Longford, pp. 280–281; St Aubyn, p. 304; Woodham-Smith, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing diplomatic crisis destabilised the government, and Palmerston resigned. Derby was reinstated as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 242; Longford, p. 281; Marshall, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria and Albert attended the opening of a new basin at the French military port of [[Cherbourg]] on 5 August 1858, in an attempt by Napoleon III to reassure Britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere. On her return Victoria wrote to Derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the [[Royal Navy]] in comparison to the [[French Navy|French one]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/12129.html|title=Napoleon III Receiving Queen Victoria at Cherbourg, 5 August 1858|publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derby's ministry did not last long, and in June 1859 Victoria recalled Palmerston to office.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 255; Marshall, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven days after Orsini's assassination attempt in France, Victoria's eldest daughter married [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Prince Frederick William of Prussia]] in London. They had been betrothed since September 1855, when Princess Victoria was 14 years old; the marriage was delayed by the Queen and Prince Albert until the bride was 17.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 259–260; Weintraub, pp. 326 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging [[Prussia]]n state.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 263; Weintraub, pp. 326, 330&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria felt &quot;sick at heart&quot; to see her daughter leave England for Germany; &quot;It really makes me shudder&quot;, she wrote to Princess Victoria in one of her frequent letters,&lt;!--8000 over 40 years--&gt; &quot;when I look round to all your sweet, happy, unconscious sisters, and think I must give them up too – one by one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Almost exactly a year later, Princess Victoria gave birth to the Queen's first grandchild, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]], who would become the last German Kaiser.

In March 1861, Victoria's mother died, with Victoria at her side. Through reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 267; Longford, pp. 118, 290; St Aubyn, p. 319; Woodham-Smith, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for &quot;wickedly&quot; estranging her from her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 267; Marshall, p. 152; Woodham-Smith, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 265–267; St Aubyn, p. 318; Woodham-Smith, pp. 412–413&lt;/ref&gt; Albert took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, p. 393; Weintraub, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Victoria and Albert visited their son, [[Edward VII|the Prince of Wales]], who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in [[Killarney]]. In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 274; Longford, p. 293; St Aubyn, p. 324; Woodham-Smith, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; Appalled, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying, to confront him.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 293; Marshall, p. 153; Strachey, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 276–279; St Aubyn, p. 325; Woodham-Smith, pp. 422–423&lt;/ref&gt; He was diagnosed with [[typhoid fever]] by [[Sir William Jenner, 1st Baronet|William Jenner]], and died on 14 December 1861. Victoria was devastated.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 280–292; Marshall, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince of Wales's philandering. He had been &quot;killed by that dreadful business&quot;, she said.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 299; St Aubyn, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; She entered a state of [[mourning]] and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances, and rarely set foot in London in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Her seclusion earned her the nickname &quot;widow of Windsor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Strachey, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria's self-imposed isolation from the public diminished the popularity of the monarchy, and encouraged the growth of the republican movement.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 170–172; St Aubyn, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; She did undertake her official government duties, yet chose to remain secluded in her royal residences—[[Windsor Castle]], [[Osborne House]], and the private estate in Scotland that she and Albert had acquired in 1847, [[Balmoral Castle]]. In March 1864, a protester stuck a notice on the railings of [[Buckingham Palace]] that announced &quot;these commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant's declining business&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 310; Longford, p. 321; St Aubyn, pp. 343–344; Waller, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Her uncle Leopold wrote to her advising her to appear in public. She agreed to visit the gardens of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] at [[Kensington]]&lt;!--''The Times'', Thursday, 31 March 1864, p. 9, no. 24834, col. D--&gt; and take a drive through London in an open carriage.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 310; Longford, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1860s, Victoria relied increasingly on a manservant from Scotland, [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 323–324; Marshall, pp. 168–169; St Aubyn, p. 356–362&lt;/ref&gt; Slanderous rumours of a romantic connection and even a secret marriage appeared in print, and the Queen was referred to as &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 321–322; Longford, pp. 327–328; Marshall, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The story of their relationship was the subject of the 1997 movie ''[[Mrs. Brown (film)|Mrs. Brown]]''. A painting by Sir [[Edwin Henry Landseer]] depicting the Queen with Brown was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], and Victoria published a book, ''Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands'', which featured Brown prominently and in which the Queen praised him highly.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 329; St Aubyn, pp. 361–362&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmerston died in 1865, and after a brief ministry led by Russell, Derby returned to power. In 1866, Victoria attended the [[State Opening of Parliament]] for the first time since Albert's death.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 311–312; Longford, p. 347; St Aubyn, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; The following year she supported the passing of the [[Reform Act 1867]] which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men,&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, pp. 374–375&lt;/ref&gt; though she was not in favour of votes for women.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 199; Strachey, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who charmed Victoria. &quot;Everyone likes flattery,&quot; he said, &quot;and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 318; Longford, p. 401; St Aubyn, p. 427; Strachey, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; With the phrase &quot;we authors, Ma'am&quot;, he complimented her.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Earle Buckle|Buckle, George Earle]]; [[William Flavelle Monypenny|Monypenny, W. F.]] (1910–20) ''The Life of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield'', vol. 5, p. 49, quoted in Strachey, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, [[William Ewart Gladstone]], was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were &quot;a public meeting rather than a woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 320; Strachey, pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, republican sentiment in Britain, fed by the Queen's seclusion, was boosted after the establishment of the [[Third French Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 381; St Aubyn, pp. 385–386; Strachey, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; A republican rally in [[Trafalgar Square]] demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, pp. 385–386; Strachey, pp. 248–250&lt;/ref&gt; In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an [[abscess]] in her arm, which [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic [[phenol|carbolic acid]] spray.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement,&lt;!--ref&gt;Marshall, p. 172; St Aubyn, p. 386&lt;/ref--&gt; the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 343–344; Longford, p. 389; Marshall, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; To general rejoicing, he pulled through.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 344–345&lt;/ref&gt; Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 345; Longford, pp. 390–391; Marshall, p. 176; St Aubyn, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

On the last day of February 1872, two days after the thanksgiving service, 17-year-old Arthur O'Connor (great-nephew of Irish MP [[Feargus O'Connor]]) waved an unloaded pistol at Victoria's open carriage just after she had arrived at Buckingham Palace. Brown, who was attending the Queen, grabbed him and O'Connor was later sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, p. 103; Hibbert, pp. 426–427; St Aubyn, pp. 388–389&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the incident, Victoria's popularity recovered further.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 427; Marshall, p. 176; St Aubyn, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empress of India==

After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the [[British East India Company]], which had ruled much of India, was dissolved, and Britain's possessions and protectorates on the [[Indian subcontinent]] were formally incorporated into the [[British Empire]]. The Queen had a relatively balanced view of the conflict, and condemned atrocities on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 249–250; Woodham-Smith, pp. 384–385&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote of &quot;her feelings of horror and regret at the result of this bloody civil war&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; and insisted, urged on by Albert, that an official proclamation announcing the transfer of power from the company to the state &quot;should breathe feelings of generosity, benevolence and religious toleration&quot;.&lt;ref name=hws&gt;Hibbert, p. 251; Woodham-Smith, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; At her behest, a reference threatening the &quot;undermining of native religions and customs&quot; was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom.&lt;ref name=hws/&gt;
[[File:Queen Victoria by Julia Abercromby.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Victoria admired [[Heinrich von Angeli]]'s 1875 portrait of her for its &quot;honesty, total want of flattery, and appreciation of character&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|1874 general election]], Disraeli was returned to power. He passed the [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874]], which removed Catholic rituals from the Anglican liturgy and which Victoria strongly supported.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 361; Longford, p. 402; Marshall, pp. 180–184; Waller, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; She preferred short, simple services, and personally considered herself more aligned with the [[presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]] than the [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 295–296; Waller, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; He also pushed the [[Royal Titles Act 1876]] through Parliament, so that Victoria took the title &quot;Empress of India&quot; from 1 May 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 361; Longford, pp. 405–406; Marshall, p. 184; St Aubyn, p. 434; Waller, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; The new title was proclaimed at the [[Delhi Durbar]] of 1 January 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 1878, the anniversary of Albert's death, Victoria's second daughter [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Alice]], who had married [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse|Louis of Hesse]], died of [[diphtheria]] in [[Darmstadt]]. Victoria noted the coincidence of the dates as &quot;almost incredible and most mysterious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria's diary and letters quoted in Longford, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1879, she became a great-grandmother (on the birth of [[Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen]]) and passed her &quot;poor old 60th birthday&quot;. She felt &quot;aged&quot; by &quot;the loss of my beloved child&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria quoted in Longford, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 1877 and February 1878, she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli to act against Russia during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Congress of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 412–413&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] and the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]]. &quot;If ''we'' are to ''maintain'' our position as a ''first-rate'' Power&quot;, she wrote, &quot;we must&amp;nbsp;... be ''Prepared'' for ''attacks'' and ''wars'', ''somewhere'' or ''other'', CONTINUALLY.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: &quot;It is not in our custom to annexe countries&quot;, she said, &quot;unless we are obliged &amp; forced to do so.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 general election]], and Gladstone returned as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 367–368; Longford, p. 429; Marshall, p. 186; St Aubyn, pp. 442–444; Waller, pp. 428–429&lt;/ref&gt; When Disraeli died the following year, she was blinded by &quot;fast falling tears&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Victoria to [[Montagu Corry, 1st Baron Rowton]], quoted in Hibbert, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; and erected a memorial tablet &quot;placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend, Victoria R.I.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Victoria farthing.jpg|thumb|upright|Victorian [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]], 1884]]
On 2 March 1882, [[Roderick Maclean]], a disgruntled poet apparently offended by Victoria's refusal to accept one of his poems,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 420; St Aubyn, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; shot at the Queen as her carriage left [[Windsor &amp; Eton Central railway station|Windsor railway station]]. Two schoolboys from [[Eton College]] struck him with their umbrellas, until he was hustled away by a policeman.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 420; St Aubyn, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria was outraged when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 420–421; St Aubyn, p. 422; Strachey, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack that she said it was &quot;worth being shot at—to see how much one is loved&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 427; Longford, p. 446; St Aubyn, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 1883, she fell down some stairs at Windsor, which left her lame until July; she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 451–452&lt;/ref&gt; Brown died 10 days after her accident, and to the consternation of her private secretary, Sir [[Henry Ponsonby]], Victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 454; St Aubyn, p. 425; Hibbert, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; Ponsonby and [[Randall Davidson]], [[Dean of Windsor]], who had both seen early drafts, advised Victoria against publication, on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 443–444; St Aubyn, pp. 425–426&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 443–444; Longford, p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1884, Victoria did publish ''More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands'', a sequel to her earlier book, which she dedicated to her &quot;devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 444; St Aubyn, p. 424; Waller, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt; On the day after the first anniversary of Brown's death, Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Leopold]], had died in [[Cannes]]. He was &quot;the dearest of my dear sons&quot;, she lamented.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Victoria's youngest child, [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Beatrice]], met and fell in love with [[Prince Henry of Battenberg]] at the wedding of Victoria's granddaughter [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]] to Henry's brother [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]]. Beatrice and Henry planned to marry, but Victoria opposed the match at first, wishing to keep Beatrice at home to act as her companion. After a year, she was won around to the marriage by Henry and Beatrice's promise to remain living with and attending her.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 477–478&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria was pleased when Gladstone resigned in 1885 after his budget was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 373; St Aubyn, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; She thought his government was &quot;the worst I have ever had&quot;, and blamed him for the death of [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]] at [[Khartoum]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller, p. 433; see also Hibbert, pp. 370–371 and Marshall, pp. 191–193&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone was replaced by [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. Salisbury's government only lasted a few months, however, and Victoria was forced to recall Gladstone, whom she referred to as a &quot;half crazy &amp; really in many ways ridiculous old man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 373; Longford, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone attempted to pass [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|a bill granting Ireland home rule]], but to Victoria's glee it was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 374; Longford, p. 491; Marshall, p. 196; St Aubyn, pp. 460–461&lt;/ref&gt; In [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|the ensuing election]], Gladstone's party lost to Salisbury's and the government switched hands again.

===Golden Jubilee===
{{main|Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria}}
[[File:Queen Victoria and Abdul Karim.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The Munshi stands over Victoria as she works at a desk|Victoria and the Munshi, Abdul Karim]]
In 1887, the [[British Empire]] celebrated [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Victoria's Golden Jubilee]]. Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueenandspecialanniversaries/HistoryofJubilees/QueenVictoria.aspx|title=Queen Victoria|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 210–211; St Aubyn, pp. 491–493&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later on 23 June,&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was [[Abdul Karim (the Munshi)|Abdul Karim]]. He was soon promoted to &quot;[[Munshi]]&quot;: teaching her [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], and acting as a clerk.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 447–448; Longford, p. 508; St Aubyn, p. 502; Waller, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 448–449&lt;/ref&gt; [[Equerry]] [[Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby|Frederick Ponsonby]] (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to [[Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], [[Viceroy of India]], &quot;the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 449–451&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 447; Longford, p. 539; St Aubyn, p. 503; Waller, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul Karim remained in her service until he returned to India with a pension on her death.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria's eldest daughter became Empress consort of Germany in 1888, but she was widowed within the year, and Victoria's grandchild Wilhelm became German Emperor as Wilhelm II. Under Wilhelm, Victoria and Albert's hopes of a liberal Germany were not fulfilled. He believed in [[autocracy]]. Victoria thought he had &quot;little heart or ''Zartgefühl'' [tact] – and&amp;nbsp;... his conscience &amp; intelligence have been completely wharped {{sic}}&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladstone returned to power after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1892|1892 general election]]; he was 82 years old. Victoria objected when Gladstone proposed appointing the Radical MP [[Henry Labouchere]] to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], so Gladstone agreed not to appoint him.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 375; Longford, p. 519&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, Gladstone retired and, without consulting the outgoing prime minister, Victoria appointed [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 376; Longford, p. 530; St Aubyn, p. 515&lt;/ref&gt; His government was weak, and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him. Salisbury remained prime minister for the remainder of Victoria's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diamond Jubilee===
[[File:Queen Victoria 60. crownjubilee.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Seated Victoria in embroidered and lace dress|Victoria in her official [[Diamond Jubilee]] photograph by [[W. &amp; D. Downey]]]]

On 23 September 1896, Victoria surpassed her grandfather [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] as the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|longest-reigning monarch in English, Scottish, and British history]]. The Queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897, to coincide with her [[Diamond Jubilee]],&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; which was made a festival of the [[British Empire]] at the suggestion of [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Joseph Chamberlain]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 546; St Aubyn, pp. 545–546&lt;/ref&gt; The prime ministers of all the self-governing [[dominion]]s were invited to London for the festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 206–207, 211; St Aubyn, pp. 546–548&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen's Diamond Jubilee procession on 22 June 1897 followed a route six miles long through London and included troops from all over the empire. The procession paused for an open-air service of thanksgiving held outside [[St Paul's Cathedral]], throughout which Victoria sat in her open carriage, to avoid her having to climb the steps to enter the building. The celebration was marked by vast crowds of spectators and great outpourings of affection for the 78-year-old Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 457–458; Marshall, pp. 206–207, 211; St Aubyn, pp. 546–548&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays. In 1889, during a stay in [[Biarritz]], she became the first reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 436; St Aubyn, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1900, the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead, the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861, in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 437–438; Longford, pp. 554–555; St Aubyn, p. 555&lt;/ref&gt; In July, her second son [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alfred]] (&quot;Affie&quot;) died; &quot;Oh, God! My poor darling Affie gone too&quot;, she wrote in her journal. &quot;It is a horrible year, nothing but sadness &amp; horrors of one kind &amp; another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and succession===
[[File:Queen Victoria by Heinrich von Angeli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Queen Victoria aged 80, 1899]]
Following a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood, Victoria spent the Christmas of 1900 at [[Osborne House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. Rheumatism in her legs had rendered her lame, and her eyesight was clouded by cataracts.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 464–466, 488–489; Strachey, p. 308; Waller, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; Through early January, she felt &quot;weak and unwell&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Victoria's journal, 1 January 1901, quoted in Hibbert, p. 492; Longford, p. 559 and St Aubyn, p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; and by mid-January she was &quot;drowsy&amp;nbsp;... dazed, [and] confused&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Her personal physician [[Sir James Reid, 1st Baronet]], quoted in Hibbert, p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; She died on Tuesday, 22 January 1901, at half past six in the evening, at the age of 81.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt; Her son and successor [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], and her eldest grandson, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany]], were at her deathbed.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 561; St Aubyn, p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; Her favourite [[Queen Victoria's pets|pet]] [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]], Turi, was laid upon her deathbed as a last request.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{citation |title=Queen Victoria: A Biographical Companion |author=Helen Rappaport |pages=34–39 |chapter=Animals |isbn=978-1-85109-355-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Queen Victoria In Dublin (Rare archive footage from 1900).webm|thumbnail|Queen Victoria In Dublin, 1900]]
In 1897, Victoria had written instructions for her funeral, which was to be military as befitting a soldier's daughter and the head of the army,&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot; /&gt; and white instead of black.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 497; Longford, p. 563&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught]], helped lift her body into the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 563&lt;/ref&gt; An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]]'s hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;&gt;[[Colin Matthew|Matthew, H. C. G.]]; Reynolds, K. D. (2004; online edition October 2009) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36652 &quot;Victoria (1819–1901)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/36652}}, retrieved 18 October 2010 (subscription required for online access)&lt;/ref&gt; Her funeral was held on Saturday, 2 February, in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in [[Frogmore#Royal Mausoleum (or 'Frogmore Mausoleum')|Frogmore Mausoleum]] at [[Windsor Great Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 565; St Aubyn, p. 600&lt;/ref&gt;

With a reign of 63 years, seven months and two days, Victoria was the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|longest-reigning]] British monarch and the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-reigning]] [[queen regnant]] in world history until her great-great-granddaughter [[Elizabeth II]] surpassed her on 9 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gander|first1=Kashmira|title=Queen Elizabeth II to become Britain's longest reigning monarch, surpassing Queen Victoria|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/queen-elizabeth-ii-to-become-britains-longest-reigning-monarch-surpassing-queen-victoria-10473729.html|accessdate=9 September 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the last monarch of Britain from the [[House of Hanover]]. Her son and successor Edward VII belonged to her husband's [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].

According to one of her biographers, Giles St Aubyn, Victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. xv; St Aubyn, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; From July 1832 until just before her death, she kept a detailed [[Queen Victoria's journals|journal]], which eventually encompassed 122 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 30; Woodham-Smith, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 503–504; St Aubyn, p. 30; Woodham-Smith, pp. 88, 436–437&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by [[A. C. Benson]], [[Hector Bolitho]], [[George Earle Buckle]], Lord Esher, [[Roger Fulford]], and [[Richard Hough]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 503–504; St Aubyn, p. 624&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria was physically unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy and no more than five feet tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 61–62; Longford, pp. 89, 253; St Aubyn, pp. 48, 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; She experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 210; Waller, pp. 419, 434–435, 443&lt;/ref&gt; Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waller, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available, such as [[Lytton Strachey]]'s ''Queen Victoria'' of 1921, are now considered out of date.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, p. 624&lt;/ref&gt; The biographies written by [[Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford|Elizabeth Longford]] and [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], in 1964 and 1972 respectively, are still widely admired.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 504; St Aubyn, p. 623&lt;/ref&gt; They, and others, conclude that as a person Victoria was emotional, obstinate, honest, and straight-talking.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hibbert, p. 352; Strachey, p. 304; Woodham-Smith, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Victoria's reign, the gradual establishment of a modern [[constitutional monarchy]] in Britain continued. Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at the expense of the [[House of Lords]] and the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, [[Walter Bagehot]] wrote that the monarch only retained &quot;the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bagehot, Walter (1867) ''The English Constitution'', London:Chapman and Hall, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; As Victoria's monarchy became more symbolic than political, it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values, in contrast to the sexual, financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy. The concept of the &quot;family monarchy&quot;, with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify, was solidified.&lt;ref&gt;St Aubyn, pp. 602–603; Strachey, pp. 303–304; Waller, pp. 366, 372, 434&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria's links with Europe's royal families earned her the nickname &quot;the grandmother of Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Carolly (1997) ''Her Little Majesty: The Life of Queen Victoria'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, ISBN 0-7432-3657-2&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria and Albert had [[Grandchildren of Victoria and Albert|42 grandchildren]], of whom 34 survived to adulthood. Their descendants include [[Elizabeth II]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Harald V of Norway]], [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden]], [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], and [[Felipe VI of Spain]].

Victoria's youngest son, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Leopold]], was affected by the blood-clotting disease [[haemophilia B]] and two of her five daughters, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Alice]] and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Beatrice]], were carriers. [[Haemophilia in European royalty|Royal haemophiliacs]] descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons, [[Tsarevich Alexei of Russia]], [[Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907–1938)|Alfonso, Prince of Asturias]], and [[Infante Gonzalo of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogaev, Evgeny I.

Around the world, places and memorials are dedicated to her, especially in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]]. [[List of places named after Queen Victoria|Places named after her]] include [[Victoria, Seychelles|the capital of the Seychelles]], [[Lake Victoria|Africa's largest lake]], [[Victoria Falls]], the [[Victoria, Gozo|capital of Gozo]] and a [[Victoria Lines|line of fortifications]] in Malta, the capitals of [[British Columbia]] ([[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]) and [[Saskatchewan]] ([[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]), and two Australian states ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]]).

The [[Victoria Cross]] was introduced in 1856 to reward acts of valour during the [[Crimean War]], and it remains the highest British, [[Victoria Cross (Canada)|Canadian]], [[Victoria Cross for Australia|Australian]], and [[Victoria Cross for New Zealand|New Zealand]] award for bravery. [[Victoria Day (Canada)|Victoria Day]] is a Canadian statutory holiday and a [[Victoria Day (Scotland)|local public holiday in parts of Scotland]] celebrated on the last Monday before or on 24 May (Queen Victoria's birthday).

==Titles, styles, and arms==

===Titles and styles===
* '''24 May 1819&amp;nbsp;– 20 June 1837:''' ''Her Royal Highness'' Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent
* '''20 June 1837&amp;nbsp;– 22 January 1901:''' ''Her Majesty'' The Queen

At the end of her reign, the Queen's full [[Style of the British sovereign#Styles of British sovereigns|style and title]] were: &quot;Her Majesty Victoria, by the Grace of God, of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] Queen, [[Fidei Defensor|Defender of the Faith]], Empress of India.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1900 Whitaker's&quot; /&gt;

===Arms===
As Sovereign, Victoria used the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]]. Before her accession, she received no grant of arms. As she could not succeed to the throne of Hanover, her arms did not carry the Hanoverian symbols that were used by her immediate predecessors. Her arms have been borne by all of her successors on the throne.

Outside Scotland, the [[blazon]] for the shield—also used on the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]]—is: [[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]]: I and IV, [[Gules]], three [[Lion (heraldry)|lions]] [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant guardant]] in [[Pale (heraldry)|pale]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] ([[Royal Arms of England|for England]]); II, Or, a lion [[rampant]] within a double [[tressure]] flory-counter-flory Gules ([[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|for Scotland]]); III, [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], a harp Or stringed [[Argent]] ([[Coat of arms of Ireland|for Ireland]]). In Scotland, the first and fourth quarters are occupied by the Scottish lion, and the second by the English lions. The [[crest (heraldry)|crests]], mottoes, and [[The Lion and the Unicorn|supporters]] also differ in and outside Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Stephen (1996) ''Royal Insignia'', London: Merrell Holberton, ISBN 978-1-85894-025-0&lt;/ref&gt;
