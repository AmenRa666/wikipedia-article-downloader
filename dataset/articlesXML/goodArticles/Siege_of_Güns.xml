{{Campaignbox Little War in Hungary}}
The '''Siege of Güns''' or '''Siege of Kőszeg''' ({{lang-tr|Güns Kuşatması}}) was a siege of [[Kőszeg]] ({{lang-de|Güns}})&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;During [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars]], the small border fort was called Güns since it was under Habsburg jurisdiction, today as a part of [[Hungary]] it is known as Kőszeg.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] within the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], that took place in 1532. In the siege, the defending forces of the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] under the leadership of [[Croats|Croatian]] [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Nikola Jurišić]] ({{lang-hu|Miklós Jurisics}}), defended the small border fort of Kőszeg with only 700–800 Croatian soldiers, with no cannons and few guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheatcroft59&quot;/&gt; The defenders prevented the advance of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army of 120,000–200,000 toward [[Vienna]], under the leadership of [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] ({{lang-ota|سليمان}} ''Süleymān'') and [[Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheatcroft59&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51&quot;&gt;Turnbull (2003), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact outcome is unknown, since it has two versions which differ depending on the source. In the first version Nikola Jurišić rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms, and in the second version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. Suleiman, having been delayed nearly four weeks, withdrew at the arrival of the August rains,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51&quot;/&gt; and did not continue towards Vienna as he had intended, but turned homeward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vambery298&quot;/&gt;

Suleiman secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several other forts,&lt;ref name=&quot;Akgunduz and Ozturk184&quot;&gt;Akgunduz and Ozturk (2011), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; but after the Ottoman withdrawal, Habsburg Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] reoccupied some of the devastated territory. Following this, Suleiman and Ferdinand concluded a [[Treaty of Constantinople (1533)|1533 treaty in Constantinople]] that confirmed the right of [[John Zápolya]] as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession of some of the reoccupied territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51-52&quot;&gt;Turnbull (2003), pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Ottoman–Habsburg wars}}
[[File:Kőszeg ostromának emléktáblája.jpg|thumb|right|Monument of the Siege of Kőszeg, located in the bourg of Kőszeg]]
On 29 August 1526, at the [[Battle of Mohács]], the [[Western Christianity|Christian]] forces led by [[Louis II of Hungary|King Louis II]] were defeated by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces led by Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull49&quot;&gt;Turnbull (2003), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Louis was killed in the battle, which resulted in the end of the independent [[Kingdom of Hungary]] as he died without an heir. Both the Kingdoms of Hungary and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]] became disputed territories with claims from both the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. Habsburg Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], who was a brother of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], married the sister of Louis II&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull, 49-51&quot;&gt;Turnbull (2003), pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corvisier and Childs289&quot;&gt;Corvisier and Childs (1994), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=&quot;Note&quot;|In 1527, the Croatian nobles [[1527 election in Cetin|met in Cetin to elect Ferdinand as their king]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt | author = R. W. Seton-Watson | title = The southern Slav question and the Habsburg Monarchy | page = 18 | isbn = | year = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The throne of Hungary became the subject of a dynastic dispute between Ferdinand and [[John Zápolya]] from [[Transylvania]], since Suleiman had promised to make Zápolya the ruler of all Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull, 55-56&quot;&gt;Turnbull (2003), pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Hungarian campaign of 1527–1528]], Ferdinand captured [[Buda]] from John Zápolya in 1527, only to relinquish his hold on it in 1529 when an Ottoman counter-attack stripped Ferdinand of all his territorial gains during 1527 and 1528.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull, 49-51&quot;/&gt; The [[siege of Vienna]] in 1529 was the first attempt by Suleiman the Magnificent to capture the Austrian capital. This siege signalled the pinnacle of Ottoman power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull, 49-51&quot;/&gt;

===Little War in Hungary===
{{Main|Little War in Hungary}}
Following Suleiman's unsuccessful Siege of Vienna in 1529, Ferdinand launched a counter-attack in 1530 to regain the initiative and avenge the destruction brought by Suleiman's 120,000 strong army. This campaign is usually considered as the start of the [[Little War in Hungary|Little War]], the period of a series conflicts between the Habsburgs and the Ottoman Empire. An assault of Buda was driven off by [[John Zápolya]], the vassal King of Hungary, but Ferdinand was successful elsewhere, capturing [[Esztergom|Gran]] (Esztergom) and other forts along the Danube river, a vital strategic frontier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51&quot;/&gt;

==Campaign of 1532==
{{See also|List of campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent}}
During the early period of the Little War in Hungary, Suleiman, as a response to Ferdinand's counter-attack in 1530, and as a part of his fifth [[List of campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent|imperial campaign]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Zürcher38&quot;&gt;Zürcher (1999), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ota|سفر همايون}}, ''Sefer-i humāyūn''){{refn|group=&quot;Note&quot;|The Ottoman Turkish name for the imperial campaigns, according to [[Sami Frashëri|Şemseddin Sâmî]] (Frashëri).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=axw-AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PT881&amp;dq=%22+%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%B1+%D9%87%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_Sb5TceLOMHqrAeWs4XwDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%B1%20%D9%87%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86%22&amp;f=false | title =  ''Kamûs-ül Â'lâm'' | author = Sami Frashëri}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in 1532, led a massive army of over 120,000 troops to besiege Vienna again. Due to Suleiman's rapid advances, Ferdinand feared the Christian forces would not be assembled in time to meet him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton 364&quot;&gt;Setton (1984), p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July, Suleiman wrote to Ferdinand from [[Osijek]] ({{lang-de|Esseg}}) in Slavonia, to assure him of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton 364&quot;/&gt; According to the letter, Suleiman's fifth campaign was primarily directed against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], and not personally against Ferdinand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton 364–365&quot;&gt;Setton (1984), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt; After Suleiman crossed the river [[Drava]] at Osijek, instead of taking the usual route for Vienna, he turned westwards into Ferdinand's held Hungarian territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51&quot;/&gt; According to historian Andrew Wheatcroft, on the route for Vienna, the Ottoman army had briefly invested and captured seventeen fortified towns or castles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheatcroft59&quot;/&gt; Ferdinand withdrew his army, leaving only 700 men with no cannons and a few guns to defend [[Kőszeg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51&quot;/&gt;

However, in order to make decisive gains, the Ottomans had to take the city quickly, as a large Imperial army, raised in Germany, reinforced by Spanish troops and led by the Emperor Charles V himself was approaching in support of Ferdinand.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Habsburg empire'', Jean Bérenger&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siege===
[[File:Kőszeg - Jurisics Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of [[Jurisics Castle]] in Kőszeg]]
Located south of [[Sopron]], the small town of Kőszeg was only a few miles from the Austrian border.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheatcroft59&quot;/&gt; It was held by a task force commanded by the [[Croats|Croatian]] soldier and diplomat [[Nikola Jurišić]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton 365&quot;&gt;Setton (1984), p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; Kőszeg was not considered a place of importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton 365&quot;/&gt; It was an insubstantial obstacle and many stronger places had yielded without a fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheatcroft59&quot;/&gt; The Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, [[Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha|Ibrahim Pasha]], did not realize how poorly defended Kőszeg was. After taking a few minor places, Suleiman came to join Ibrahim Pasha shortly afterwards, when the siege had already started.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51&quot;/&gt;

The Ottomans met stiff resistance at Kőszeg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton 365&quot;/&gt; Suleiman had hoped that the imperial army would come to relieve Kőszeg, affording him an opportunity for a larger engagement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton 366&quot;&gt;Setton (1984), p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the Ottoman attacks on Kőszeg, the imperial army still formed up in [[Regensburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg169&quot;&gt;Gregg (2009), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans continued with one attack after another; artillery fire brought down parts of the walls, but brought no surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton 365&quot;/&gt;{{refn|group=&quot;Note&quot;|According to a historian [[Paolo Giovio]], the siege of Güns failed because the Ottomans had not brought large siege guns, expecting to engage the Emperor in a field battle.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg (2009), pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Ottomans' mines were sapped by countermines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton 365&quot;/&gt; The layout of Kőszeg's walls made mining a feasible strategy, but even though several mines succeeded in blowing holes in the fortifications, the defenders held out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51&quot;/&gt; For more than twenty-five days, without any artillery, Captain Nikola Jurišić and his garrison of 800 Croats held out against nineteen full-scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the Ottomans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheatcroft59&quot;/&gt;

The outcome has two versions. In the first version, Nikola Jurišić rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms, and the Ottomans retreated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheatcroft59&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson442&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ágoston and Alan Masters583&quot;&gt;Ágoston and Alan Masters (2009), p. 583&lt;/ref&gt; In the second version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. The only Ottomans who would be allowed to enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the [[Ottoman flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51&quot;/&gt; In either case, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51&quot;/&gt; and returned homeward instead of continuing towards Vienna as previously planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vambery298&quot;/&gt; He had been delayed nearly four weeks, and during this time a powerful army had been collected in Vienna, which Suleiman had not the intention to face.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vambery298&quot;/&gt; According to historian Paolo Giovio, Charles arrived with an imperial army at Vienna on 23 September, too late for fighting the Ottomans since Suleiman already withdrew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zimmerman124&quot;&gt;Zimmerman (1995), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; By their defense of Kőszeg, Nikola Jurišić and his men had saved Vienna from a siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vambery298&quot;/&gt;{{refn|group=&quot;Note&quot;|According to &quot;A Historical Encyclopedia&quot;, the dogged defense of Kőszeg convinced Suleiman to give up on besieging Vienna, which was much more fortified.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Historical Encyclopedia151&quot;/&gt;}}

==Aftermath==

Although he was stopped at Kőszeg and failed to conquer Vienna, Suleiman additionally secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several forts, since Ferdinand and Charles evaded an open field battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akgunduz and Ozturk184&quot;/&gt; Immediately after the Ottoman withdrawal, Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black26&quot;&gt;Black (1996), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Suleiman concluded a [[Treaty of Constantinople (1533)|peace treaty]] with Ferdinand in 1533, in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51-52&quot;/&gt; The treaty confirmed the right of [[John Zápolya]] as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession of that part of the country that enjoyed the status quo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull51-52&quot;/&gt;

This treaty did not satisfy Zápolya or Ferdinand, whose armies began to skirmish along the borders. After Zápolya's death in 1540, Suleiman annexed Hungary to the Ottoman realm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott58-59&quot;&gt;Scott (2011), pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Although from 1529 to 1566 the borders of the Ottoman Empire moved further west, none of the campaigns after 1529 achieved the decisive victory that would secure the new Ottoman possessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uyar and Erickson74&quot;&gt;Uyar and Erickson (2009), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;
