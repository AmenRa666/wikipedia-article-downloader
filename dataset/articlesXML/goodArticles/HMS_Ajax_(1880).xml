'''HMS ''Ajax''''' was the [[name ship]] of [[Ajax-class ironclad|her class]] of [[ironclad]] [[battleships]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the 1870s. Completed in 1883, she was immediately placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] until 1885 when the ship was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] for the first time. Later that year, ''Ajax'' was assigned as a [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|coast guard ship]] in Scotland and remained there for the next six years. She was reduced to reserve again in 1891 and was taken out of service a decade later. The ship was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1904 and subsequently broken up.

==Design and description==
The ''Ajax'' class was designed as a shallow-[[draft (hull)|draught]] version of the preceding {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|2}} that was also smaller and cheaper; unfortunately the need, imposed by budgetary constraints, to produce a smaller ship produced a vessel with all of the shortcomings of ''Inflexible'' but with none of her virtues.&lt;ref name=p2&gt;Parkes, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; The ships had a [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|280|ft|m|1}} and were {{convert|300|ft|9|in|m|1}} [[Length overall|long overall]], some {{convert|44|ft|m|1}} shorter than ''Inflexible''. They had a beam of {{convert|66|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|23|ft|6|in|m|1}} and [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|8510|LT|t|lk=on}}. Their crew consisted of 345 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]], over {{convert|3000|LT|t|0}} less than ''Inflexible''. The ''Ajax''-class ships were bad [[seaboat]]s and steered very erratically, especially at high speed. More [[deadwood (shipbuilding)|deadwood]] was added to their sterns in 1886 in a partially successful attempt to rectify the problem.&lt;ref name=ck0&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Ajax'' class was powered by a pair of inverted, vertical, [[Marine steam engine#Compound engine|compound-expansion steam engines]]. These were built by [[John Penn and Sons]] and each drove a single propeller using steam provided by 10 [[Scotch marine boiler|cylindrical boilers]]. The engines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|6000|ihp|lk=in}} for a speed of {{convert|13|kn|lk=in}}. The ships carried a maximum of {{convert|970|LT|t|0}} of coal, enough to steam {{convert|2100|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|9|knots}}.&lt;ref name=b5&gt;Burt, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

They copied the main armament layout of ''Inflexible'' with their turrets arranged ''[[en echelon]]'' so that both turrets could directly ahead and to each side, although this was more theoretical than practical due to damage from [[Muzzle flash|muzzle blast]]. Each turret mounted a pair of [[rifled muzzle loader|rifled muzzle-loading]] [[RML 12.5 inch 38 ton gun|RML {{convert|12.5|in|adj=on|0}} guns]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 85, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Their shells weighed {{convert|809|lb|kg|1}} while the gun itself weighed {{convert|38|LT|t|0}}. The guns had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1575|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and were credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal {{convert|18.4|in}} of [[wrought iron]] armour at the [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]].&lt;ref name=ck6&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; To attack the unarmoured portion of their opponents, the ''Ajax'' class was fitted with a pair of [[Rifled breech loader|rifled breech-loading]] [[BL 6 inch 80 pounder gun|BL {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}}, 80-pounder guns]].&lt;ref name=p5&gt;Parkes, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; For defence against [[torpedo boat]]s, they carried six [[List of British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] [[QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt|QF 6-pdr ({{convert|57|mm|in|abbr=on|1|disp=flip}}) Nordenfelt gun]]s. The ships also mounted a pair of above-water {{convert|14|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo]] launchers&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; and could carry a {{convert|60|ft|adj=on|1}} torpedo boat.&lt;ref&gt;Branfill-Cook, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ''Ajax'' class copied ''Inflexible''{{'}}s armour scheme of a heavily [[Armored citadel|armoured citadel]] with unamoured ends and sides. But unlike their predecessor, they lacked enough [[buoyancy]] to remain afloat if their ends were flooded. The citadel was {{convert|104|ft|m|1adj=mid|-long}} and the armour was composed of wrought iron plates {{convert|10|in|0}} and {{convert|8|in|mm|0}} thick, separated and backed by 10 inches of [[teak]] at the [[waterline]], reducing above and below the waterline to an armoured thickness of {{convert|15|in|1}} in a similar sandwich. The citadel was closed off by fore and aft transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s that were {{convert|16.5|in|0}} thick above water and {{convert|13.5|in|0}} below. The armoured [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|3|in}} thick from bow to stern. The turrets were protected by [[compound armour]] plates {{convert|16|to|14|in|0}} thick and  {{convert|12|in|0|adj=on}} plates defended the [[conning tower]].&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 26; Parkes, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Ajax'', the fourth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy,&lt;ref&gt;Colledge, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; was named for the [[Ajax (mythology)|mythological hero]].&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was [[laid down]] on 21 March 1876 in No. 4 [[Slipway]], [[Pembroke Dockyard]], [[Wales]], and was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 10 March 1880 by Mrs. George Parkin, wife of the dockyard's [[Captain-Superintendent]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, pp. 217–18&lt;/ref&gt; She was completed on 30 March 1883 at a cost of [[pound sterling|£]]548,393.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt;

''Ajax'' was not [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] until 30 April 1885 and was assigned to the Particular Service Squadron commanded by Admiral [[Geoffrey Hornby]].&lt;ref name=p6&gt;Parkes, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, the squadron evaluated the weapons and defences of a fortified harbour, [[Berehaven]] (now Castletownbere), Ireland, against torpedo boats and other threats.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, location 3317&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1885, when tensions with Russia had subsided, she was posted as [[guard ship]] at [[Greenock]]. ''Ajax'' accidentally collided with the [[turret ship]] {{HMS|Devastation|1871|2}} in 1887 off [[Isle of Portland|Portland]].&lt;ref name=p65/&gt; The latter had one compartment below water holed, but ''Ajax'' only received two holes in her bow.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The ship participated in the annual manoeuvres in August 1889 and a shell exploded in one of her 12.5-inch gun barrels on 2 September, wounding one man.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, pp. 16, 367&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was reduced to reserve at [[Chatham Dockyard]] in 1891. Her BL six-inch, 80-pounder guns were replaced by [[QF 6 inch /40 naval gun|QF six-inch guns]] in 1897. She was further reduced to Dockyard Reserve in November 1901, and was sold to Castles for scrap in March 1904&lt;ref name=p65&gt;Parkes, pp. 265–66&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently broken up at [[Charlton, London|Charlton]].&lt;ref&gt;Winfield &amp; Lyon, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;
