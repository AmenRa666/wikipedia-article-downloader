The '''Lochnagar mine''' was an underground explosive charge, secretly planted by the British during the [[World War I|First World War]], ready for 1 July 1916, the [[First day on the Somme]]. The [[Mining (military)|mine]] was dug by the [[Royal Engineer tunnelling companies|Tunnelling Companies of the Royal Engineers]] under a German field fortification known as {{lang|de|''Schwabenhöhe''}} (Swabian Height) in the front line, south of the village of [[Ovillers-la-Boisselle|La Boisselle]] in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] ''[[département]]''. The mine was named after Lochnagar Street, the British trench from which the gallery was driven. It was part of a [[Mines on the first day of the Somme|series of 19 mines]] that were placed beneath the German lines on the British section of the Somme front to assist the start of the battle. The Lochnagar mine was sprung at {{nowrap|7:28 a.m.}} on 1 July 1916 and left a crater {{convert|100|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|30|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide which was captured and held by British troops. The attack on either flank was defeated by German small-arms and artillery fire, except on the extreme right flank and just south of La Boisselle, north of the Lochnagar Crater. The crater has been preserved as a memorial and a religious service is held each 1 July.

==Background==

===1914===
French and German military operations began on the Somme in September 1914. A German advance westwards towards [[Albert, Somme|Albert]] was stopped by the French at [[La Boisselle]] and attempts to resume offensive warfare in October failed. Both sides reduced their attacks to local operations or raids and began to fortify their remaining positions with underground works. On 18 December, the  French captured the La Boisselle village cemetery at the west end of a German salient and established an advanced post only {{convert|3|m|yd}} from the German front line. By 24 December, the French had forced the Germans back from the cemetery and the western area of La Boisselle but their advance was stopped a short distance forward at ''[[L'îlot de La Boisselle]]'', in front of German trenches protected by barbed wire.{{sfn|Whitehead|2010|pp=159–174}} Once the location of a farm and a small number of buildings, {{lang|fr|L'îlot}} became known as ''Granathof'' ([[German language|German]], shell farm) to the Germans and later as the Glory Hole to the British. On Christmas Day 1914, French engineers sank the first mine shaft at La Boisselle.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

===1915===
[[File:Chalk areas, northern France.jpg|thumb|{{center|Map of chalk areas in northern France}}]]
[[File:Geological cross-section Somme area.jpg|thumb|{{center|Geological cross-section of the Somme battlefield}}]]
Fighting continued in [[no man's land]] at the west end of La Boisselle, where the opposing lines were {{convert|200|yd|m}} apart, even during lulls along the rest of the Somme front. On the night of {{nowrap|8/9 March}}, a German sapper inadvertently broke into French mine gallery, which he found to have been charged with explosives; a group of volunteers took {{nowrap|45 nerve}} racking minutes to dismantle the charge and cut the firing cables. From April {{nowrap|1915 – January}} 1916, {{nowrap|61 mines}} were sprung around ''L'îlot'', some loaded with {{convert|20000|–|25000|kg|lb}} of explosives.{{sfn|Sheldon|2005|pp=62–65}} 

The French mine workings were taken over when the British moved into the Somme front.{{sfn|Edmonds|1932|pp=38, 371}} [[George Henry Fowke|G.F. Fowke]] moved the [[174th Tunnelling Company|174th]] and [[183rd Tunnelling Company |183rd]] Tunnelling Companies into the area, but at first the British did not have enough miners to take over the large number of French shafts; the problem was temporarily solved when the French agreed to leave their engineers at work for several weeks.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=114}} On 24 July 1915, [[174th Tunnelling Company]]  established headquarters at Bray, taking over some 66 shafts at Carnoy, Fricourt, Maricourt and La Boisselle. No man's land just south-west of La Boisselle was very narrow, at one point about {{convert|50|yd|m|order=flip}} wide, and had become pockmarked by many chalk craters.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} To provide the tunnellers needed, the British formed the [[178th Tunnelling Company |178th]] and [[179th Tunnelling Company |179th]] Tunnelling Companies in August 1915, followed by the [[185th Tunnelling Company |185th]] and [[252nd Tunnelling Company |252nd]] Tunnelling Companies in October.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=114}} The [[181st Tunnelling Company]] was also present on the Somme.{{sfn|Fenwick|2008|nopp=y}}

Elaborate precautions were taken to preserve secrecy, since no continuous front line trench ran through the area opposite the west end of La Boisselle and the British front line. The ''L'îlot'' site was defended by posts near the mine shafts.{{sfn|Edmonds|1932|pp=38, 371}} The underground war continued with offensive mining to destroy opposing strong points and defensive mining to destroy tunnels, which were {{convert|30|–|120|ft|m}} long. Around La Boisselle, the Germans dug defensive transverse tunnels about {{convert|80|ft|m}} long, parallel to the front line.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} On 19 November 1915, the [[179th Tunnelling Company]] commander, Captain Henry Hance, estimated that the Germans were {{convert|15|yd|m}} away and ordered the mine chamber to be loaded with {{convert|6000|lb|kg|order=flip}} of explosives, which was completed by midnight on {{nowrap|20/21 November.}} At {{nowrap|1:30 a.m.}} the Germans blew the charge, filling the remaining British tunnels with carbon monoxide. The right and left tunnels collapsed and it was later found that the German explosion had detonated the British charge.{{sfn|Banning et al.|2011|nopp=y}}{{efn|The wrecked tunnels were gradually re-opened but about thirty bodies remained beneath La Boisselle.{{sfn|Banning et al.|2011|nopp=y}}}}

==Prelude==

===1916===
[[File:Map commune FR insee code 80615.png|thumb|{{center|Map of the vicinity of Ovillers-La Boisselle (commune FR insee code 80615)}}]]
At the start of the [[Battle of Albert (1916)|Battle of Albert]] (1–13 July), the name given by the British to the first two weeks of the [[Battle of the Somme]], La Boisselle stood on the main axis of British attack. The  [[tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers|tunnelling companies]] were to make two major contributions to the Allied preparations for the battle by placing [[Mines on the first day of the Somme|19 large and small mines]] beneath the German positions along the front line and by preparing a series of shallow [[Russian sap]]s from the British front line into [[no man's land]], which would be opened at [[Zero Hour]] and allow the infantry to attack the German positions from a comparatively short distance.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=115}} 

At La Boisselle, four mines were prepared by the Royal Engineers: Two charges (known as ''No 2 straight'' and ''No 5 right'') were planted at {{lang|fr|[[L'îlot de La Boisselle|L'îlot]]}} at the end of galleries dug from Inch Street Trench by the 179th Tunnelling Company, intended to wreck German tunnels{{sfn|Shakespear|1921|p=37}} and create crater lips to block [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire along no man's land. As the Germans in La Boisselle had fortified the cellars of ruined houses, and cratered ground made a direct infantry assault on the village impossible, two further mines, known as ''[[Y Sap mine|Y Sap]]'' and ''Lochnagar'' after the trenches from which they were dug, were laid on the north-east and the south-east of La Boisselle to assist the attack on either side of the German salient in the village{{sfn|Banning et al.|2011|nopp=y}}{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} – [http://www.lochnagarcrater.org/LaBoisselleMap.jpg see map].

The [[185th Tunnelling Company]] started work on the ''Lochnagar'' mine on 11 November 1915 and handed the tunnels over to 179th Tunnelling Company in March 1916.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} A month before the handover, 18 men of the 185th Tunnelling Company (2 officers, 16 sappers) were killed on 4 February when the Germans detonated a camouflet near the British three-level mine system, starting from Inch Street, La Boisselle, the deepest level being just above the water table at around {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}}

[[File:Battle of the Somme 1916 mine plan - Lochnagar.jpg|thumb|{{center|Plan of the ''Lochnagar'' mine; for an aerial view of the site with marked front lines, see  [http://www.animalaid.org.uk/images/education/WWI/history/HL6/2d_TheGloryHole.jpg here]}}]]
The ''Lochnagar'' mine consisted of two chambers with a shared access tunnel (see map). The shaft was sunk in the communication trench called &quot;Lochnagar Street&quot;. After the [[Black Watch]] had arrived at La Boissselle at the end of July 1915, many existing Allied fortifications, originally dug by the French, had been given Scotland-related names. The ''Lochnagar'' mine probably had the first deep incline shaft, which sloped {{nowrap|1:2–1:3}} to a depth of about {{convert|95|ft|m|order=flip}} – [http://www.lochnagarcrater.org/CraterSideElevation.jpg see map]. It was begun {{convert|300|ft|m|order=flip}} behind the British front line and {{convert|900|ft|m|order=flip}} away from the German front line. Starting from the inclined shaft, about {{convert|50|ft|m|order=flip}} below ground, a gallery was driven towards the German lines.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} For silence, the tunnellers used bayonets with spliced handles and worked barefoot on a floor covered with sandbags. Flints were carefully prised out of the chalk and laid on the floor; if the bayonet was manipulated two-handed, an assistant caught the dislodged material. [[Overburden|Spoil]] was placed in sandbags and passed hand-by-hand, along a row of miners sitting on the floor and stored along the side of the tunnel, later to be used to [[tamp]] the charge.{{sfn|Edmonds|1932|p=375}} 

When about {{convert|135|ft|m|order=flip}} from the {{lang|de|''Schwabenhöhe''}}, the tunnel was forked into two branches and the end of each branch was enlarged to form a chamber for the explosives, the chambers being about {{convert|60|ft|m|order=flip}} apart and {{convert|52|ft|m|order=flip}} deep{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} – [http://www.lochnagarcrater.org/ExplosiveChambers.jpg see map]. When finished, the access tunnel for the ''Lochnagar'' mine was {{convert|4.5|×|2.5|ft|m|order=flip}} and had been excavated at a rate of about {{convert|18|in|cm|order=flip}} per day, until about {{convert|1030|ft|m|order=flip}} long, with the galleries beneath the {{lang|de|''Schwabenhöhe''}}. The mine was loaded with {{convert|60000|lb|kg|order=flip}} of [[ammonal]], divided in two charges of {{convert|36000|lb|kg|order=flip}} and {{convert|24000|lb|kg|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Edmonds|1932|p=375}} As the chambers were not big enough to hold all the explosive, the tunnels that branched to form the 'Y' were also filled with ammonal. The longer branch was {{convert|60|ft|m|order=flip}} long, the shorter was {{convert|40|ft|m|order=flip}} long. The tunnels did not quite reach the German front line but the blast would dislodge enough material to form a {{convert|15|ft|m|order=flip}} high rim and bury nearby trenches.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} The ''Lochnagar'' and the ''Y Sap'' mines were &quot;overcharged&quot; to ensure that large rims were formed from the disturbed ground.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} Communication tunnels were also dug for use immediately after the first attack,{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}}  including a tunnel across no man's land to a point close to the Lochnagar mine, ready to extend to the crater after the detonation as a covered route.{{sfn|Shakespear|1921|pp=37, 41}} The mines were laid without interference by German miners but as the explosives were placed, German miners could be heard below ''Lochnagar'' and above the ''Y Sap'' mine.{{sfn|Edmonds|1932|p=375}}

Captain Stanley Bullock described the conditions of the work:
{{quotation|At one place in particular our men swore they thought he ''[the German enemy]'' was coming through, so we stopped driving forward and commenced to chamber in double shifts.  We did not expect to complete it before he blew, but we did.  A chamber 12′ x 6′ x 6′ in 24 hours.  The Germans worked for a shift more than we did and then stopped. They knew we had chambered and were afraid we should blow and no more work was done there. I used to hate going to listen in that chamber more than any other place in the mine. Half an hour, sometimes once sometimes three times a day, in deadly silence with the geophone to your ears, wondering whether the sound you heard was the Boche working silently or your own heart beating. God knows how we kept our nerves and judgement.  After the Somme attack when we surveyed the German mines and connected up to our own system, with the theodolite we found that we were 5 feet apart, and that he had only started his chamber and then stopped.|Captain Stanley Bullock, 179th Tunnelling Company{{sfn|Banning et al.|2011|nopp=y}}}}

==Battle==

===1 July===
{{See also|Capture of La Boisselle}}
[[File:La Boisselle sector 1 July 1916.png|thumb|{{center|34th Division attack at La Boisselle, 1 July 1916}}]]
[[File:Lochnagar crater wwi aerial photo.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|{{center|Contemporary British aerial photograph showing the crater and trenches}}]]

The four mines at La Boisselle were detonated at {{nowrap|7:28 a.m.}} on 1 July 1916, the [[first day on the Somme]]. The explosion of the ''Lochnagar'' mine was initiated by Captain James Young of the 179th Tunnelling Company, who  pressed the switches and observed that the firing had been successful.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} The two charges of the ''Lochnagar'' mine created a single, vast, smooth sided, flat bottom crater measuring some 220 feet (67 metres) diameter excluding the lip, and 450 feet (137 metres) across the full extent of the lip. It had obliterated between 300 and 400 feet (91 and 122 metres) of the German dug-outs, all said to have been full of German troops.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} At the time, the ''Lochnagar'' mine, along with the ''Y Sap'' mine, were the largest mines ever detonated.{{sfn|Legg|2013|nopp=y}} The sound of the blast was considered the loudest man-made noise in history up to that point, with reports suggesting it was heard in London.{{sfn|Waugh|2014|nopp=y}} They would be surpassed a year later by the [[Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917)|mines in the Battle of Messines]]. The Lochnagar mine lay on the sector assaulted by the [[Grimsby Chums]], a [[Pals battalion]] (10th Battalion, [[The Lincolnshire Regiment]]).{{sfn|Legg|2013|nopp=y}} The infantry of the British [[34th Division (United Kingdom)|34th Division]], which was composed of [[Pals battalions]] from the north of England, attacked the positions on either side of La Boisselle, of Reserve Infantry Regiment 110 of the German [[28th Reserve Division (German Empire)|28th Reserve Division]], mainly recruited from [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]].{{sfn|Whitehead|2013|p=297}}

When the main attack began at {{nowrap|7:30 a.m.,}} the Grimsby Chums occupied the [[subsidence crater|crater]] and began to fortify the eastern lip, which dominated the vicinity and the advance continued to the {{lang|de|''Grüne Stellung''}} (second position), where it was stopped by the 4th Company, which then counter-attacked and forced the British back to the crater.{{sfn|Whitehead|2013|p=297}} During the day German artillery fired into [[Sausage Valley]] and in the afternoon began systematically to shell areas and then fire bursts of machine-gun fire to catch anyone who moved. German artillery also began to bombard the crater, where wounded and lost men sought shelter, particularly those from Sausage Valley to the south of the village. British artillery began to fire on the crater, which led to shell bursts on both slopes, leaving the men inside with nowhere to hide. A British aircraft flew low overhead and a soldier waved a dead man's shirt, at which the aeroplane flew away and the British shelling stopped.{{sfn|Middlebrook|1971|pp=135, 218}}&lt;!--The 34th Division incurred the largest number of casualties of the British divisions which attacked on 1 July. needs a cite--&gt;

====Aerial observation====
The blowing of the ''Y Sap'' and ''Lochnagar'' mines was witnessed by pilots who were flying over the battlefield to report back on British troop movements. It had been arranged that continuous overlapping patrols would fly throughout the day. [[2nd Lieutenant]] [[Cecil Arthur Lewis|Cecil Lewis]]' patrol of [[No. 3 Squadron RAF|3 Squadron]] was warned against flying too close to La Boisselle, where two mines were due to go up, but would be able to watch from a safe distance. Flying up and down the line in a [[Morane-Saulnier L|Morane Parasol]], he watched from above [[Thiepval]], almost two miles from La Boisselle, and later described the early morning scene in his book ''Sagittarius Rising'' (1936): 
{{quote|We were over Thiepval and turned south to watch the mines. As we sailed down above all, came the final moment. Zero! At Boisselle the earth heaved and flashed, a tremendous and magnificent column rose up into the sky. There was an ear-splitting roar, drowning all the guns, flinging the machine sideways in the repercussing air. The earthly column rose, higher and higher to almost four thousand feet. There it hung, or seemed to hang, for a moment in the air, like a silhouette of some great cypress tree, then fell away in a widening cone of dust and debris. A moment later came the second mine. Again the roar, the upflung machine, the strange gaunt silhouette invading the sky. Then the dust cleared and we saw the two white eyes of the craters. The barrage had lifted to the second-line trenches, the infantry were over the top, the attack had begun.|Cecil Lewis, whose aircraft was hit by lumps of mud thrown up by the explosion.{{sfn|Lewis|1936|p=90}}{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|p=54}}}}

As aircraft from 3 Squadron flew over the III Corps area, observers reported that the 34th Division had reached Peake Wood on the right flank, increasing the size of the salient which had been driven into the German lines north of Fricourt but that the villages of La Boisselle and Ovillers had not fallen. On 3 July, air observers noted flares lit in the village during the evening, which were used to plot the positions reached by British infantry.{{sfn|Jones|1928|p=212}}

A communication tunnel was used to contact troops near the new crater and during the afternoon, troops from the 9th [[Cheshire Regiment|Cheshires]] of the 19th Division began to move forward and a doctor was sent from the Field Ambulance during the night.{{sfn|Shakespear|1921|pp=41, 45}} By {{nowrap|2:50 a.m.}} on 2 July, most of the 9th Cheshires had reached the crater and the German trenches adjacent, from which they repulsed several German counter-attacks during the night and the morning.{{sfn|Wyrall|1932|p=41}} On the evening of 2 July, the evacuation of wounded began and on 3 July, troops from the crater and the vicinity pushed forward to the south-east, occupying a small area against slight opposition.{{sfn|Shakespear|1921|p=48}}

==Analysis==
Despite their colossal size, the ''Lochnagar'' and ''Y Sap'' mines failed to help sufficiently neutralise the German defences in La Boisselle. The ruined village was meant to fall in 20 minutes, but by the end of the [[first day on the Somme|first day of the battle]], it had not been taken while the III Corps divisions had lost more than {{nowrap|11,000 casualties}}. At Mash Valley, the attackers lost 5,100 men before noon, and at Sausage Valley near the crater of the ''Lochnagar'' mine, there were over 6,000 casualties – the highest concentration on the entire battlefield. The III Corps' [[34th Division (United Kingdom)|34th Division]] suffered the worst losses of any unit that day.{{sfn|Banning et al.|2011|nopp=y}}

==Commemoration==
[[File:Lochnagar Crater -1.JPG|thumb|{{center|The memorial cross}}]]
[[William Orpen]], an [[British official war artists|official war artist]], saw the mine crater in 1916 while touring the Somme battlefield, collecting subjects for paintings and described a wilderness of chalk dotted with shrapnel. [[John Masefield]] also visited the Somme, while preparing ''[[The Old Front Line]]'' (1917), in which he also described the area around the crater as dazzlingly white and painful to look at.{{sfn|Masefield|1917|pp=70–73}} After the war the ''Café de la Grand Mine'' was built nearby; after the Second World War, many of the smaller craters were filled but the Lochnagar mine crater remained.{{sfn|Gliddon|1987|pp=255–256}} Attempts to fill it in were resisted and the land was eventually purchased by an Englishman, Richard Dunning to ensure its preservation, after he read ''The Old Front Line'' and was inspired to buy a section of the former front line.{{sfn|Skinner|2012|p=192}}

Dunning made more than {{nowrap|200 enquiries}} about land sales in the 1970s and was sold the crater.{{sfn|Skinner|2012|p=192}} The site had been used by cross-country motorbikes and for [[fly tipping]] but Dunning erected a memorial cross on the rim of the crater in 1986, using reclaimed timber from a [[Gateshead]] church; the cross was struck by lightning shortly after its installation and was repaired with metal banding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvaa.info/jimwintersthesomme.htm Jim Winters - The Somme] 1st Volunteer Artillery (Tynemouth) Association&lt;/ref&gt; The site attracts about {{nowrap|200,000 visitors}} a year and there is an annual memorial service on 1 July, to commemorate the detonation of the mine and the British, French and German war dead, when poppy petals are scattered into the crater.{{sfn|Legg|2013|nopp=y}}{{sfn|Skinner|2012|p=195}}
