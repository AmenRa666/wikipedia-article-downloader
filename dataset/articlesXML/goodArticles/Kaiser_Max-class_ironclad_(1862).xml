The '''''Kaiser Max'' class''' of [[broadside ironclad]]s was a group of three vessels built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in the 1860s. The class consisted of {{SMS|Kaiser Max|1862|2}}, the [[lead ship]], {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1862|2}}, and {{SMS|Juan de Austria||2}}. They were an improved version of the preceding {{sclass-|Drache|ironclad|4}}, being larger, carrying a larger gun battery, and having more powerful engines. The three ships were all laid down in 1861, launched in 1862, and completed in 1863.

''Don Juan d'Austria'' took part in the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864 but did not see combat. Two years later, Austria was attacked by [[Prussia]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in the [[Seven Weeks' War]]; a major naval engagement was fought against Italy at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] in July 1866, where all three ships saw action. After the war, they were modernized, but did not see further active service. In poor condition by 1873, the Navy decided to discard the ships. But because parliament refused to budget funds to build replacements, the commander of the Navy, [[Friedrich von Pöck]] requested permission to &quot;rebuild&quot; the three ''Kaiser Max''es, which was granted. In fact, the three ships were [[ship breaking|broken up]], with only their engines, armor plate, and some other equipment being reused in the new ships.

==Design==
Following the launch of the French {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}}, the world's first [[ironclad warship]], the [[Austrian Navy]] began a major ironclad construction program under the direction of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Ferdinand Max]], the ''Marinekommandant'' (naval commander) and brother of Kaiser [[Franz Josef I]], the emperor of Austria. In 1861, the first two ships, the {{sclass-|Drache|ironclad|4}}, were laid down and three more were ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Pawlik, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, pp. 6&amp;ndash;7&lt;/ref&gt; These ships were designed by the Director of Naval Construction [[Josef von Romako]]; he based the design for the three new ships on the ''Drache'' class, but enlarged it and incorporated more powerful engines. The new ships also carried more guns.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 267&amp;ndash;268&lt;/ref&gt;

===General characteristics and machinery===
The ''Kaiser Max''-class ships were {{convert|70.78|m|sp=us}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]]; they had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.32|m|abbr=on}}. They displaced {{convert|3588|MT|sp=us}}. Wooden [[hull (watercraft)|hulled]] vessels, they proved to be very wet forward and had to have their [[bow (ship)|bows]] rebuilt in 1867. Each ship originally had a bow [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]], which was removed during the reconstruction. They were also very unstable ships, pitching badly and having very bad [[seakeeping]]. The ships had a crew of 386.&lt;ref name=G268/&gt;

Their propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion, 2-cylinder, horizontal [[steam engine]] that drove a single [[screw propeller]]. The number and type of their coal-fired [[boiler]]s have not survived, though they were trunked into a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] located [[amidships]]. The engines were rated {{convert|11|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|1900|ihp|lk=in}}; on trials, ''Kaiser Max'' slightly exceeded those figures, reaching {{convert|11.4|kn}} from {{convert|1926|ihp|abbr=on}}. They were fitted with a three-masted [[sailing rig|rig]] to supplement the steam engines.&lt;ref name=G268/&gt;

===Armament and armor===
The ships of the ''Kaiser Max'' class were [[broadside ironclad]]s, and she was armed with a [[main battery]] of sixteen 48-pounder [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] guns and fifteen 24-pounder {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading]] guns. She also carried two smaller guns, one 12-pounder and one 6-pounder. In 1867, the ships were rearmed with a battery of twelve {{convert|7|in|abbr=on}} muzzle-loaders manufactured by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] and two {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} guns. The ships' hulls were sheathed with [[wrought iron]] armor that was {{convert|110|mm|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name=G268/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:SMS Kaiser Max illustration.tif|thumb|Illustration of ''Kaiser Max'', c. 1866]]

During the [[Second Schleswig War]] of 1864, ''Don Juan d'Austria'' was deployed with the [[ship of the line]] {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|2}} and two other vessels to the [[North Sea]], but arrived too late to take part in any fighting, then-Commodore [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] having already inflicted a strategic defeat on the Danish squadron at the [[Battle of Heligoland (1864)|Battle of Heligoland]].&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, p. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; All three ships saw action during the [[Seven Weeks' War]] that pitted Austria against Prussia and Italy two years later. The war at sea culminated at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] in July 1866, where all three ships were heavily engaged, though they were not seriously damaged and inflicted little on their Italian opponents. Neither side's ships carried guns strong enough to defeat their opponents armor plating.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 242–245&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the ships were disarmed and [[:wikt:laid up|laid up]].&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, the ships were drydocked to correct some of their handling deficiencies,&lt;ref name=G268/&gt; and install their new rifled guns.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They did not return to active service after the work was completed, however. Severely reduced naval budgets owing to Hungarian disinterest&amp;mdash;the Austrian Empire having been replaced by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Dual Monarchy]] in the postwar ''[[Ausgleich]]''&amp;mdash;in naval matters prevented the Austro-Hungarian fleet from taking an active policy.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; As the ships were badly rotted and thoroughly obsolete by the early 1870s, Rear Admiral [[Friedrich von Pöck]], then the commander of the fleet, proposed that the ships be &quot;rebuilt&quot;. The ships were in fact stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1873 and [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap, but the subterfuge allowed Pöck to build three new ships, also named {{SMS|Kaiser Max|1875|2}}, {{SMS|Don Juan d'Austria|1875|2}}, and {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1877|2}}, during a period where parliament steadfastly refused to approve funding for new ironclads. Some parts of the ships were reused, to include the engines but not the boilers, armor plate, and other miscellaneous equipment to save construction costs.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 268, 270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;
