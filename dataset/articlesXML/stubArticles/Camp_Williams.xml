'''Camp W. G. Williams''', commonly known as '''Camp Williams''', also known as '''Army Garrison Camp Williams''', is a [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] training site operated by the [[Utah National Guard]]. It is located south of [[Bluffdale, Utah|Bluffdale]], west of [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]], and north of [[Saratoga Springs, Utah|Saratoga Springs]] and [[Cedar Fort, Utah|Cedar Fort]], approximately {{convert|25|mi|km|sigfig=2}} south of [[Salt Lake City]], straddling the border between [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake County]] and [[Utah County, Utah|Utah County]] in the western portion of the [[Traverse Ridge|Traverse Mountains]]. Camp Williams is also home to the Non-Commissioned Officer's Basic Leader Course, which is taught to Active, National Guard, and Reserve components.

Camp Williams land comprises about {{convert|6|sqmi|km2|0}} of flat area and {{convert|47|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of mountainous region.

==History==
The [[Utah Army National Guard]] traces its beginnings to the Utah Territorial Militia, known as the [[Nauvoo Legion]]. The Nauvoo Legion operated similarly to militias in other states and territories, including requiring adult men—between the ages of 18 and 45—to serve. The militia served as guardians of the [[Central Overland Route]], and in the [[Utah War]], [[Black Hawk War (1865–1872)|Black Hawk War]] and [[Walkara#Walker War|Walker War]]. During this period the legion's various units had annual musters and training camps, with [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi's]] unit often doing so near the site of today's Camp Williams. During a power struggle between the [[Federal government of the United States]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the militia was abolished in the [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]] of 1887.

By March 1894 conflicts had settled down, and the Utah Territorial Legislature authorized [[Caleb Walton West]], the [[Governor of Utah|Governor]], to establish The National Guard of Utah. Twenty years later, in 1914 and 1915, [[President of the United States|US president]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] set aside 18,700 acres to provide permanent training grounds for the guard. This was the first official designation of land that would comprise Camp Williams. This original land makes up the western majority of the current site, which is rough and rugged, and lacked flat land for a [[cantonment]] area (headquarters and camp). So the State of Utah rented nearby flatter land, and then later purchased it to build a cantonment area. Permanent use of the area, including buildings, was not established at this time, due to [[World War I]], and the site was just occasionally used until the 1920s. In both 1926 and 1927 the guard's annual encampment was held at the site, and in 1928 the camp was officially established for permanent use as Camp W.G. Williams. It was named after Brigadier General William Grey Williams in recognition of his war participation since the [[Spanish–American War]] and his work in establishing the site as a permanent training location.

{{main|Machine Gun Fire}}
On 19 September 2010, live fire .50-caliber machine gun training at the camp sparked the &quot;[[Machine Gun Fire]]&quot; that resulted in over 3,500 acres burned and the loss of three homes in the city of [[Herriman, Utah|Herriman]] to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guard takes blame for massive fire, saying ‘we failed’|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/50317750-78/fire-homes-guard-monday.html.csp|work=Salt Lake Tribune|publisher=MediaNews Group|author1=Bergreen, Jason |author2=Mike Gorrell, |author3=Nate Carlisle |date=20 September 2010|accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utah Data Center===

From 2011 to 2013, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) built a {{USD|1.5 billion}} ''Community Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative Data Center'' at Camp Williams, the first in a series of data centers required for the [[Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New NSA center unveiled in budget documents|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_12744661|work=Salt Lake Tribune|publisher=MediaNews Group|author=LaPlante, Matthew D.|date=2 July 2009|accessdate=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=LaPlante, Matthew D.|title=Spies like us: NSA to build huge facility in Utah |url=http://www.sltrib.com/ci_12735293|date=2 July 2009|publisher=MediaNews Group|work=Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;construction-start&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Fidel|first=Steve|title=Utah's $1.5 billion cyber-security center under way |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705363940/Utahs-15-billion-cyber-security-center-under-way.html |publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|1,500,000|sqft}} facility is built on {{convert|200|acres}} where Camp Williams' former airfield was located on the west side of [[Utah State Route 68|Utah Highway 68]]. It is rumored to be capable of storing 1&amp;nbsp;[[yottabyte]] of data by 2015, although this figure remains highly speculative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenyon&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://defensesystems.com/Articles/2011/01/07/NSA-spy-cyber-intelligence-data-center-Utah.aspx|title=New NSA data center breaks ground on construction – Defense Systems|last=Kenyon|first=Henry|date=7 January 2011|publisher=Defense Systems|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/nsa-to-store-yottabytes-in-utah-data-centre-49304118/|title=NSA to store yottabytes in Utah data centre |work=[[CNET Networks]]|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/nov/05/whos-in-big-brothers-database/|title=Who’s in Big Brother’s Database?  |last=Bamford |first=James|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility will use 65 [[megawatts]] of electricity and will cost another $2&amp;nbsp;billion for hardware, software, and maintenance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenyon&quot;/&gt;

This facility will greatly increase the NSA's ability to store and process millions of emails, [[instant messages|IMs]], [[SMS]], and phone calls made daily by people around the world and in the United States.&lt;ref name=NSAWIRED /&gt;
