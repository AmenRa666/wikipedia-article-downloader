In a video shot by a bystander, Adebolajo said: {{quote|The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers. And this British soldier is one … By Allah, we swear by the almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone. So what if we want to live by the Sharia in Muslim lands? Why does that mean you must follow us and chase us and call us extremists and kill us? … when you drop a bomb do you think it hits one person? Or rather your bomb wipes out a whole family? … Through many passages in the Koran we must fight them as they fight us … I apologise that women had to witness this today but in our lands women have to see the same. You people will never be safe. Remove your governments, they don’t care about you. You think David Cameron is gonna get caught in the street when we start busting our guns?

On 31 May, the [[Inquest (England and Wales)|inquest]] into Rigby's death was opened and adjourned at [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] Coroner's Court.

On 19 December 2013, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were found guilty of the murder of Lee Rigby. The judge, [[Nigel Sweeney|Mr Justice Sweeney]], said that he would pass [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] after a key appeal court ruling on the use of [[Whole life tariff|whole life terms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;verdict&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25450555 |title=Two guilty of Lee Rigby murder|publisher=BBC News |date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 2014, both men were sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

During the sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney said that the extremist views of the attackers were a &quot;betrayal of Islam&quot;, prompting Adebowale to shout &quot;That’s a lie&quot;, while Adebolajo shouted &quot;''[[Allahu Akbar]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;bbc_sentence&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/woolwich-adeboloajo-adebowale-lee-rigby-murder-sentence |work=Channel 4 News |title=Woolwich attack: life for Lee Rigby killers |publisher=Channel 4 |date=26 February 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a scuffle with security guards in the dock, both men were removed from the court and the sentencing continued in their absence.&lt;ref name = &quot;bbc_sentence&quot; /&gt;

On 3 December 2014, Rigby's killers lost legal challenges to their sentences. Michael Adebolajo had attempted to have his conviction overturned and whole-life sentence reduced, while Michael Adebowale attempted a reduction in his minimum sentence of 45 years. Both requests were rejected at the Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30306145|title=Lee Rigby murder: Killer loses legal challenge|publisher=BBC News|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night after Rigby's death, two mosques were attacked.

===Video footage controversy===
Video footage of one of the perpetrators justifying the killing of Lee Rigby was obtained by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and [[ITN]].&lt;ref name=20130524pressgaz&gt;Hollander, Gavriel (24 May 2013).

''Press Gazette''.&lt;/ref&gt; ITN's video, which was edited before it was broadcast,&lt;ref name=20130524guardianjosh&gt;Halliday, Josh (24 May 2013). [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/may/24/woolwich-attack-itv-michael-adebolajo-confession &quot;Woolwich attack: ITV removes content from suspect's video 'confession'&quot;]. ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; aired during the 18:30 ''ITV News'' bulletin before the 21:00 [[Watershed (broadcasting)#United Kingdom|watershed]], and again in its 22:00 bulletin.&lt;ref name=20130524pressgaz/&gt; After being posted on the ITN website in the afternoon, the high level of visits caused the site to crash and go offline for around half an hour.&lt;ref name=20130524pressgaz/&gt; Total traffic on the site, which averages 860,000 unique users per week, reached 1.2 million for the day of the attack.&lt;ref name=20130524guardianjosh/&gt;

Managing editor of ''The Sun'', Richard Caseby, said the newspaper had faced &quot;a very difficult decision&quot;. Both media outlets argued they had released the video &quot;in the public interest&quot;. [[BBC News]] showed some parts of the video. [[Sky News]] decided not to follow suit, as senior editors were of the opinion that the graphic images were &quot;unnecessarily distressing&quot;. Both ITV and the BBC ran warnings before showing the footage. Most of Britain's national daily newspapers grabbed still images from the video footage for their front pages the next morning.&lt;ref name=20130524pressgaz/&gt; A BBC executive said that the news organisation edited the footage before broadcasting, and &quot;dealt with the material as carefully as we could.&quot; The spokesman said they &quot;thought very carefully about the pictures… and gave great consideration to how we used the footage&quot;. They argued that the footage was an important element of the story and shed light on the perpetrators and the possible motives for the attack.&quot;&lt;ref name=20130523thedrum/&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported there were &quot;around 800 complaints from distressed viewers&quot;.&lt;ref name=20130524guardianjosh/&gt; Most complaints were targeted at the television coverage, with ITV receiving 400 complaints in the 24 hours following the broadcast.&lt;ref name=20130523thedrum&gt;Stephen Lepitak, (23 May 2013).

On 17 June, the broadcasting standards watchdog [[Ofcom]] launched an investigation into broadcast of footage from the attack after receiving about 700 complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22938744 |publisher=BBC News |title=Ofcom investigates broadcasting of Lee Rigby footage |date=17 June 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ofcom published its findings on 6 January 2014, ruling that the news footage had not breached broadcasting regulations.

===Anti-terrorism task force===
The UK government established a task force to look at ways of stemming the growth of Islamic extremism in Britain, focusing on the radicalisation of worshippers in mosques, university students and prisoners. The task force – chaired by David Cameron – had its inaugural meeting at [[10 Downing Street]] on 3 June 2013, and includes [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet Ministers]], and representatives from the police and intelligence services. Later that day Cameron made a [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] statement on the Woolwich attack, saying that lessons must be learned. &quot;When young men born and bred in this country are radicalised and turned into killers, we have to ask some tough questions about what is happening in our country. It is as if that for some young people there is a conveyor belt to radicalisation that has poisoned their minds with sick and perverted ideas. We need to dismantle this process at every stage – in schools, colleges, universities, on the internet, in our prisons, wherever it is taking place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22756225 |title= Woolwich killing a betrayal of Islam, says Cameron|publisher= BBC News|date= 3 June 2013|accessdate= 6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary inquiry===
On 25 November 2014, the findings of a British parliamentary inquiry into the murder of Lee Rigby were published. The report found that the death could not have been prevented, although his killers had appeared in seven intelligence investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30192912 |title=Woolwich murder: Lee Rigby's death 'not preventable'|publisher= BBC News|date= 25 November 2014|accessdate= 25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/26/world/europe/document-report-on-the-intelligence-relating-to-the-murder-of-fusilier-lee-rigby.html Report on the Intelligence Relating to the Murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby]&quot; [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|Intelligence and Security Committee]], 25 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Michael Adebowale had discussed killing a soldier on [[Facebook]] with a foreign-based extremist known as &quot;Foxtrot&quot;.

==Reactions==
Queen [[Elizabeth II]], political leaders and religious leaders variously expressed concern and distress over the incident, and called for calm.&lt;ref name=&quot;guard&quot;/&gt; Prime Minister David Cameron made the following statement:&lt;blockquote&gt;This country will be absolutely resolute in its stand against extremism and terror. This action was a betrayal of Islam and the Muslim communities that give so much to our country. We will defeat violent extremism by standing together. We will not rest until we know every detail. [The attackers told Ingrid Loyau-Kennett that] they wanted to start a war in London and she replied, &quot;You are going to lose, it is you against many.&quot; She speaks for all of us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many Muslim leaders denounced the attack. The Prime Minister's statement was echoed by Shaykh [[Ibrahim Mogra]], with the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Justin Welby]], the co-chair of the Christian Muslim Forum, in a joint statement.&lt;ref name=Telegraph24/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Archbishop praises faith groups response to Woolwich attack|first=Jennifer|last=O'Mahony|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10078941/Archbishop-praises-faith-groups-response-to-Woolwich-attack.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=24 May 2013|accessdate=18 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muslim Council of Britain]] said the attack &quot;has no basis in Islam and we condemn this unreservedly&quot;.&lt;ref name='BBC'/&gt; The head of the Ramadhan Foundation, [[Mohammed Shafiq]], also condemned the attack. The director of [[Faith Matters]] and co-ordinator of the government-backed anti-Islamophobic project [[Tell MAMA UK|Tell MAMA]] stated: &quot;We, as the Muslim community, will work against anyone who promotes such hatred.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guard&quot;/&gt;

[[Anjem Choudary]] refused to condemn the attack. He said, &quot;I'm not in the business of condemnation or condoning. I think if anyone needs to be condemned it is the British government and their foreign policy. It's so clear that that is the cause.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Michael |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/23/us-britain-killing-choudary-idUSBRE94M0OZ20130523 |title=Head of radical Islamist group who knew London knifeman blames UK foreign policy |agency=Reuters |date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On BBC's ''Newsnight'', when Choudary was questioned about his role in the radicalisation of Michael Adebolajo, he denied any responsibility, and talked about such radicalisation as a means to an end. He stated that he believed that not many Muslims would disagree with what Adebolajo had said in his videoed statement.&lt;ref name=BBC22650053&gt;{{cite news|title=Anjem Choudary refuses to 'abhor' Woolwich attack|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22650053|accessdate=24 May 2013|publisher=BBC News|date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asghar Bukhari]] of the UK [[Muslim Public Affairs Committee]] said that both the British Government and the Muslim community were at fault in dealing with &quot;extremism&quot;. He criticised the British Government for being involved in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan while &quot;completely denying that it has anything to do with the political situation around the Muslim world&quot;, and said that Muslim organisations &quot;have failed their own community by not teaching these young, angry men how to get a democratic change to this policy that's ruining so many lives&quot;. He described Muslim leaders as unwilling to bring about change, focussing on points of theology, rather than the practical education of young people in ways to achieve political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/23/world/europe/uk-attack-muslims/index.html|title=UK Muslim groups condemn London slaying, urge leaders to act|date=23 May 2013|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pauline Neville-Jones, Baroness Neville-Jones|Baroness Neville-Jones]], a former security minister and chairman of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|British Joint Intelligence Committee]], and Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], a former Army commander, suggested blame could be put on internet hate preaching. Neville-Jones told the [[BBC Radio 4]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme that &quot;the inspiration that comes from internet hate preaching and jihadist rhetoric… is a very, very serious problem now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dominiczak|first=Peter|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/10075306/Woolwich-attack-We-must-tackle-hate-preaching-over-the-internet-security-experts-say.html|title=Woolwich attack: We must tackle hate preaching over the internet, security experts say|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 May 2013|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Galloway]], then an MP, said that the attack on Lee Rigby was &quot;indefensible&quot;.

Former UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] saw the attack not as an isolated expression of two crazed individuals but part of the broader &quot;problem within Islam&quot;.&lt;ref name=Blair&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/lee-rigby-and-the-struggle-to-contain-violent-islamists-by-tony-blair|title=The Trouble Within Islam|date=10 June 2013|author=Tony Blair|newspaper=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign press reports there was widespread outrage and condemnation of the killing. Yusif al-Shihab, in [[Kuwait]]'s ''Al-Abas'', stated that the assailants have &quot;deformed the image of Islam&quot; while Batir Mohammad Wardum in the [[Jordan]]ian daily ''[[Ad-Dustour (Jordan)|Al-Dustur]]'', and other Middle Eastern newspapers, stressed that their actions have endangered the lives of thousands of Muslims.&lt;ref name=BBC20130524/&gt;

The killing triggered a public outpouring of grief and hundreds of bunches of flowers, teddy bears, poems and other tributes were left near the scene of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2330219/Woolwich-attack-Outpouring-grief-murdered-Lee-Rigby-stream-strangers-leave-tributes-street-died.html#ixzz2YrJt5tFA |title=RIP brave soldier: Outpouring of grief for murdered Lee Rigby as stream of strangers leave their tributes on street where he died |author=Rosie Taylor |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=24 May 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013 British anti-terrorist police warned several Muslims who had spoken out against Islamist extremism, some of them explicitly against the murder of Rigby, that they had been targeted in a video created by [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]], the group responsible for the [[Westgate shopping mall attack|attack on the Westgate shopping mall]] in Kenya.&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Hooper |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/10/british-muslims-defiant-over-al-shabab-threat-2013102591313719196.html |title=British Muslims defiant over al-Shabab threat |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date= |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
