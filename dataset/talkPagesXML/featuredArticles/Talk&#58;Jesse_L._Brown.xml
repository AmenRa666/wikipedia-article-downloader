== Dates ==

Is there any reason the dates in this article are not written mm/dd/yyyy? It is about an American after all. [[User:Gaia Octavia Agrippa|&lt;font color=&quot;#87CEFA&quot;&gt;Gaia Octavia Agrippa&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt; [[User talk:Gaia Octavia Agrippa|&lt;font color=&quot;#26619C&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;  21:21, 5 October 2012 (UTC)
:It's part of the manual of stile for WP:MILHIST. Dates in articles primarily dealing with military topics use DMY. —[[User:Ed!|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''Ed!'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ed!|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''(talk)'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:50, 14 November 2012 (UTC)

::I find this very annoying. Why is this mode arbitrarily correct? I guess it is in accord with military practice in discussing wars and battles, but a birthdate?? This is a bio, not a tactical treatise. Wikipedia becomes more British daily.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.82.131.179|98.82.131.179]] ([[User talk:98.82.131.179|talk]]) 13:51, 4 December 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:::No, the U.S. military prefers DMY format as well. And that's an issue you'll want to take up at [[WP:MILHIST]]. —[[User:Ed!|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''Ed!'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ed!|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''(talk)'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:21, 4 December 2012 (UTC)
:: Interesting. I came here wondering the same. --[[User:MZMcBride|MZMcBride]] ([[User talk:MZMcBride|talk]]) 21:57, 4 December 2012 (UTC)

== Siblings names mixed up? ==

Did we get the name of his sister (listed as &quot;Johnny&quot;) mixed up with that of one of his brothers (listed as &quot;Lura&quot;)?
Just a thought.
[[User:Lilly granger|Lilly]] ([[User talk:Lilly granger|talk]]) 01:19, 4 December 2012 (UTC)
:Nope. I did a double take on that myself, actually. Multiple sources make it clear that Johnny was female, Lura was male. —[[User:Ed!|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''Ed!'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ed!|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''(talk)'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:13, 4 December 2012 (UTC)

== Who was who's wingman? ==

Both the article for Jessie L. Brown and the article for Thomas J. Hudner, Jr. list the other man as the wingman.  Jessie L. Brown article: &quot;...and Lieutenant Junior Grade Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who was Brown's wingman&quot;.  Thomas J. Hudner, Jr article: &quot;He rose to the rank of captain, and received the Medal of Honor for his actions in trying to save the life of his wingman, Ensign Jesse L. Brown, during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War&quot;.

I don't know much about aviator tradition but the wingman article says that the wingman is the plane that follows behind the leader. As one would have had to have been in front of the other I would take it one man would have been the other's wingman.  Do the sources specify which was wingman?  [[User:Wolfhound668|Wolfhound668]] ([[User talk:Wolfhound668|talk]]) 13:25, 4 December 2012 (UTC)
:They don't; only that the two were flying together that day, and that Hudner was replacing someone else. In all likelihood Brown was the lead, as he was more experienced, but I don't have sources confirming that directly. —[[User:Ed!|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''Ed!'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ed!|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''(talk)'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:20, 4 December 2012 (UTC)
::Do you think it would make sense in Hudner's article to change from &quot;wingman&quot; to &quot;squadron mate&quot; since its unclear?  Squadron mate is the term used in his MOH citation.  As an aside, I find it interesting that he's still alive and has a ship ordered that is to be named after him.  I was in the army so not too familar with Navy traditions but always assumed that sort of thing is posthumous. Would that be rare enough to add to his article? [[User:Wolfhound668|Wolfhound668]] ([[User talk:Wolfhound668|talk]]) 14:40, 4 December 2012 (UTC)
:::Yeah, I think that would be fine. —[[User:Ed!|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''Ed!'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ed!|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''(talk)'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:20, 4 December 2012 (UTC)

== Life magazine  ==

i'm a newbie here, so forgive me if I'm doing this wrong: under military career: it says his photograph appeared in ''Life'' magazine, which I think is referenced to Taylor's book, where Taylor actually said &quot;I also recall a picture of him in ''Life'' magazine&quot; (page xii). http://books.google.com/books?id=r5H9RLUFQJoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &lt;br /&gt;

I've been searching the ''Life'' archive on google books - and can't find any reference to the Brown photo - so I think he may have recalled wrong (perhaps Time?) but I'm still looking--- for what it's worth [[User:Gonne Yeats|Gonne Yeats]] ([[User talk:Gonne Yeats|talk]]) 17:31, 2 August 2013 (UTC).

: There would be no reason not to edit it to say &quot;Taylor recalls ...&quot; if that's what the ref says. [[User:Pinkbeast|Pinkbeast]] ([[User talk:Pinkbeast|talk]]) 17:33, 2 August 2013 (UTC)

That's what bothers me---- It would be inappropriate to say Taylor's recall is perhaps apocryphal. I know the AP picked up the story (I have a reference in the October 22, 1948 New York Times), but the Life magazine photo I haven't found yet, so I guess the statement should stand as is----- just because I can't find it, doesn't mean it isn't there.  :) [[User:Gonne Yeats|Gonne Yeats]] ([[User talk:Gonne Yeats|talk]]) 03:36, 3 August 2013 (UTC)</text>
