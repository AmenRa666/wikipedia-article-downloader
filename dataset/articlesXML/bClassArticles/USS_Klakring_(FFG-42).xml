Klakring]] (1904–1975), who was awarded three [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]] as commander of the [[submarine]] {{USS|Guardfish|SS-217|6}} during [[World War II]].

==Construction and Commissioning==
''Klakring'' was laid down on 19 February 1982 by the [[Bath Iron Works]] Corp. [[Bath, Maine]]; [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 18&amp;nbsp;September 1982; sponsored by Beverly Bohen, niece of Rear Admiral Klakring; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 20&amp;nbsp;August 1983 at Bath, Commander Leonard O. Wahlig in command.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/k/klakring-ffg-42-1982-1990.html | title=Klakring (FFG 42) | publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command | date=28 July 2015 | accessdate=5 January 2016 |author1=Frey, Courtney |author2=Evans, Mark L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service History==

===1980s===

====1983====
''Klakring'' completed a Light-Off Examination on 8 September 1983, followed on 15 September by her Initial Crew Certification. The ship reached her initial home port of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], on 18 September. Family members and friends on the pier displayed homemade banners while they welcomed the ship as she maneuvered up the [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper River]] on 28 September.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

The ship sailed for her shakedown cruise to [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean waters]]. She visited [[St. Thomas, Virgin Islands]] (4–7 November 1983), and on 13 November put into [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba]]. ''Klakring'' sailed on 3 December, carried out a Weapons Systems Accuracy Test at [[Port Everglades|Port Everglades, Florida]], and then test fired torpedoes on the range at [[Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center]] (AUTEC), [[Andros, Bahamas|St. Andros Island]], on 13 December. She returned to Charleston on 16 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

[[File:DN-SC-86-05678.jpg|thumb|left|A close-in starboard bow view of ''Klakring'' as she steams in the Atlantic, 28 June 1983. (U.S. Navy photograph DN-SC-86-05678, courtesy of Bath Iron Works, Defense Visual Information Center)]]

====1984====
''Klakring'' carried out additional training during the New Year 1984, including a visit to [[Nassau, Bahamas]] (27–30 January 1984), a brief stop for fuel in [[Frederiksted, United States Virgin Islands|Frederiksted, St. Croix, Virgin Islands]], and another port visit on 18 February to [[Roosevelt Roads Naval Station|Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico]]. ''Klakring'' completed her [[Shakedown cruise|Post Shakedown Availability]] at Bath (5 April–23 August). The yard work included the installation of fin stabilizers. The ship conducted her [[sea trials]] on 29 September, and on loaded weapons from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on 7 September. [[Hurricane Diana (1984)|Hurricane Diana]] swept up the East Coast and delayed the frigate’s return to Charleston from her scheduled date of 11 September to 16 September. The ship completed a variety of training during the succeeding weeks, and escorted the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Nimitz||2}} during mid November.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

====1985====
''Klakring'' sailed for nearly five weeks of Refresher Training off Guantánamo Bay on 14 January 1985. On 21 February, Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron [[HSM-72|(Light—HSL-42)]] Detachment 3, equipped with a single [[Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk]] Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) Mk III, embarked on board Klakring. The ship began participation in her first major fleet exercise, [[Composite Unit Training Exercise]] (COMTUEX) 2-85, on 22 April 1985. She broke up the training with a three-day visit to [[Frederiksted, U.S. Virgin Islands]], and returned to Charleston on 8 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

The [[destroyer]] {{USS|Comte de Grasse|DD-974|2}} and ''Klakring'' sailed as MEF 3-85 Transit Group for the [[United States Naval Forces Central Command|Middle East Force]] on 7 June 1985. This cruise marked the frigate’s first overseas deployment. Comdr. Whalig served as the group’s [[Officer in Tactical Command]] (OTC). The two ships fueled and provisioned at [[Ponta Delgada, Azores]] on 13 June, entered the [[United States Sixth Fleet]], and stopped for additional fuel and supplies at [[Naval Station Rota Spain|Rota, Spain]] on 16 June. ''Klakring'' visited [[Palma de Mallorca, Spain]] (18–21 June). The ship then crossed the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] by easterly courses.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

''Klakring'' passed southbound through the [[Suez Canal]] on 25 and 26 June 1985. As the ship crossed the [[Red Sea]], she began to observe the weekends on Thursdays and Fridays to assimilate crewmen to [[Muslim]] daily routines. ''Klakring'' fueled and provisioned at [[Djibouti]], [[Horn of Africa]], on 30 June. On 1 July, she rendezvoused with [[guided missile destroyer]] {{USS|Charles F. Adams|DDG-2|2}} and exchanged information and equipment. Whalig became Commander Task Unit (CTU) 109.1.2, and oversaw the scheduling of all multi-ship training in the [[Persian Gulf]]. ''Klakring'' sailed through the [[Strait of Hormuz]], and on 7 July rendezvoused with command ship {{USS|La Salle|AGF-3|2}} near [[Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). The frigate escorted the [[flagship]] to [[Sitra|Sitrah, Bahrain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

During the ship’s first two months in the Persian Gulf, visibility averaged barely {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} because of haze, sand, and dust. The daily temperature repeatedly rose to {{convert|117|°F|°C|abbr=on}} with 90% humidity. The frigate’s Seahawk flew an average of two sorties per day, and the crew reported that the presence of the strong temperature inversion made radar ranges of 160 nautical miles at altitudes below {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} common, which extended the helo’s patrol coverage of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

The ship next visited [[Al Jubayl, Saudi Arabia]] (14–17 July 1985), briefly patrolled the Persian Gulf, and then completed upkeep at [[Mina Salman]], [[Bahrain]] (22–31 July). On 6 August, ''Klakring'' escorted ''La Salle'', and fueled and provisioned at Sitrah on 20 August. The frigate sailed from the Persian Gulf, and (25–28 August) visited [[Karachi, Pakistan]]. She passed through the Strait of Hormuz into the Persian Gulf on 31 August, and completed an additional upkeep at [[Dubai]], UAE (3–10 September). The ship anchored at Sitrah for a Combat Systems Groom (13–15 September). On 20 September, she sailed from the Persian Gulf and trained with the [[Indian Ocean]] [[Carrier battle group|Battle Group]], focusing on aircraft carrier operations, [[anti-air warfare]], [[underway replenishment]], and [[antisubmarine warfare]]. ''Klakring'' returned to the Persian Gulf on 24 September, training along the way with [[French Navy|French]] [[aviso]] [[D'Estienne d'Orves-class aviso|''Quartier-Maître Anquetil'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

After topping off her fuel and provisions on 26 October 1985, ''Klakring'' made for Ash Shuaibah, [[Kuwait]], as the flagship for Commander Middle East Force. The ship patrolled the Persian Gulf, and completed upkeep at Mina Salman (30 October–4 November). The guided missile frigate {{USS|Gallery|FFG-26|2}} relieved ''Klakring'' in the Persian Gulf on 6 and 7 November. On 9 November, ''Klakring'' rendezvoused with ''Comte de Grasse'' and the two ships formed a transit group back to the United States. Comdr. Wahlig again served as OTC for the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

''Klakring'' fueled and provisioned at [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]] on 11 November 1985, and continued northward across the Red Sea, returning to the standard workweek when she reached the southern entrance to the Suez Canal on 15 November. The following day, both ships transited the canal northbound, and visited [[Malaga, Spain]] (20–23 November). On 24 November, ''Klakring'' fueled and provisioned at Rota on 24 November, and that same afternoon entered the [[United States Second Fleet|Second Fleet]]. The frigate celebrated [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] in [[Ponta Delgada (Azores)|Ponta Delgada]], and returned to Charleston on 6 December 1985. On 12 December, Comdr. James M. Coon relieved Comdr. Wahlig as the commanding officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

====1986====
The ship accomplished Combined At Sea Operations (CASTOPS) 2-86 (3–15 February 1986), including a visit to Nassau in the Bahamas (8–11 February). ''Klakring'' underwent an Operational Propulsion Plant Examination (OPPE) from 26 to 28 April, 1 and 2 May, and 29 and 30 May. The ship visited [[Savannah, Georgia]], on 27 and 28 June. ''Klakring'' trained with ''Nimitz'' from 8 to 17 July 1986, including a visit to Port Everglades (11–14 July). On 31 July and 1 August, the ship conducted special projects for the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO).&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

Following her CNO project and a visit to [[Dodge Island|Dodge Island Terminal]], [[Miami|Miami, Florida]] (8–10 September) ''Klakring'' held a Tiger Cruise for her crew’s dependents, on 11 September 1986. While the ship sailed to the operating area, she received a distress call from ''King Fisher II'', a small [[fishing boat]] from Charleston. ''Klakring'' proceeded at full speed to ''King Fisher II'', and the ship transferred her emergency party via small boat to render assistance. The frigate returned to port on 12 September. On 29 September she off loaded her weapons at the [[Naval Weapons Station Charleston]], and completed her first Selective Restricted Availability (SRA-1) from 30 September to 5 December. On 12 December, ''Klakring'' on loaded her weapons from the Naval Weapons Station, and carried out her [[sea trials]] (15–18 December).&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

The frigate visited [[Taormina]], [[Sicily]] (19–21 June). She passed through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea on 24 June, and on 29 June refueled at Djibouti.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

The ship supported [[Operation Earnest Will]]. The [[Iran]]ians and [[Iraq]]is escalated their attacks against ships sailing in the Persian Gulf during the [[Iran-Iraq War|Persian Gulf War]] between those two countries, and the U.S. launched Earnest Will to maintain [[freedom of navigation]] in the area. The Americans initially renamed and reflagged eleven Kuwaiti tankers. ''Klakring'' patrolled the Persian Gulf between [[Radar Picket]] Stations North and South. The ship repeatedly passed outbound through the Strait of Hormuz to refuel from [[underway replenishment ship]]s, and then returned to the Persian Gulf. On 10 August, ''Klakring'' embarked a detachment of Army helicopters and helped coordinate the efforts of British tugs converted for [[Mine sweeping#Mine sweeping|mine sweeping]]. ''Klakring'' escorted {{SS|Bridgeton||2}}—reflagged tanker ''Al Rekkah''—outbound through the Strait of Hormuz on 30 August. The Iranians mined ''Bridgeton'' on 24 July, but the tanker survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

The frigate rendezvoused with cargo ship {{USNS|Courier|T-AK-5019|2}} and steamship ''President Pierce'' and escorted them to [[Fujairah]] (2 and 3 September 1987).

===1990s===

====1990====
''Klakring'' began 1990 inport Charleston, South Carolina after returning from a Mediterranean cruise in November.

In January, ''Klakring'' spent most of her time in the Charleston and Jacksonville OPAREA's conducting exercises. After completing an combat Systems Assessment on January l0, the ship arrived in Port Everglades, Florida on 13 January for a five-day port visit. While transiting back to Charleston, the ship encountered extremely rough weather with high winds and heavy seas. The Commanding Officer made the decision to enter port at night due to heavy weather, and the crew successfully conducted a difficult navigation detail in the Cooper River and returned ''Klakring'' to homeport during the stormy night.

The last two weeks of February were spent preparing for Type Commander's Core Training (TCCT) 2-90 and conducting deck landing qualifications with [[HSM-46|Helicopter Anti-Submarine Light FORTY SIX]] in the Jacksonville OPAREA. On 22 February, the ship rendezvoused with the frigate {{USS|Truett|FF-1095|2}} and submarine {{USS|San Juan|SSN-751|2}} just east of the Bahamas. ''Klakring'' arrived in Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico on 26 February, onloaded exercise torpedoes, and was underway to the Puerto Rico OPAREA to begin TCCT 2-90.

During TCCT 2-90, the ship partidipated in numerous tracking and gunnery exercises, underway refuelings, highline transfers, and anti-submarine warfare evolutions. In addition, ''Klakring'' was selected to conduct two live missile firings along with the cruiser {{USS|Mississippi|CGN-40|2}}. Only one of the two missiles engaged the target due to a missile failure on the first missile fired. The event was significant in providing critical data needed in the performance evaluation of one of the Navy's primary weapons.

The month of March consisted of an Operational Propulsion Plant Examination (OPPE) and a Change of Command Ceremony. The two-day engineering inspection was completed on 23 March. On 30 March, CDR Larry J. Carter relieved CDR Dennis J. Van Buskirk as the fourth Commanding Officer of the frigate.

On 5 April, the ship began its preliminary preparations for its scheduled Dry-Docking Selective Restricted Availability (DSRA) with an offload of ammunition and weapons at the Charleston Naval Weapons Station. ''Klakring''{{'}}s non-essential ammunition being transferred to the frigate {{USS|Fahrion|FFG-22|2}}.

On 14 May, the ship was underway en route to Mayport Naval Station, Florida to make final preparations to enter the shipyard. All hands participated in an Integrated Logistics Overhaul offload of all shipboard parts and supplies completed on 16 May, and on 23 May, ''Klakring'' was dry-docked at Atlantic Dry Dock facility to begin the DSRA. The entire crew was moved into the Jacksonville Airport Days Inn Motel and would reside there for a period of 74 days.

In early August, the crew moved out of the Days Inn Motel and returned to shipboard living. On 27 August, installation of the SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array Sonar System began.

''Klakring'' started the month of September preparing for the most important of a continued series of inspections: the Propulsion Examination Board Light-Off Examination (LOE). LOE commenced on 10 September and on 12 September she was &quot;certified to steam.&quot; The end of the overhaul period was drawing near, and on 14 September the ship was underway for the final phase: the post-DSRA sea trials. All systems proved reliable and ''Klakring'' was delivered on 17 September, thirty-one days ahead of schedule and under budget. The ship would remain at the Mayport Naval Station for another month.

On 25 October, the ship got underway from Mayport and arrived at homeport Charleston one day later. Upon arrival, there was a Welcome Home Party held on board for all the families and friends of the crew.

''Klakring'' was scheduled to participate in Caribbean Law Enforcement Operations in November, but a post overhaul hull inspection brought about a change in plans. After careful examination of videos of an underwater hull inspect:ion, it was determined that the ship's hull would have to be repainted. ''Klakring'' was dry-docked from 7–21 November at the Charleston Naval Shipyard to undergo the necessary repairs. The ship successfully received full aviation certification on 27 November, and began final preparations for a Harpoon Missile Tactical Qualification.

On 5 December, the ship was underway to embark HSL-48's Lamps MK III crew to participate in Destroyer Squadron Six &quot;Operation Greyhound&quot; for two days, fine tuning the skills of ship maneuvering and communications. In addition, ''Klakring'' turned north on 7 December en route to the Boston OPAREA to conduct at sea evaluations of the Navy's new MK 50 Torpedo. Assisting aircraft were able to fire weapons, but continuously adverse weather conditions prevented ''Klakring'' and HSL-48 from doing so. The ship returned to Charleston on 19 December and began another extensive inspection the following day. The ship's Training Readiness Evaluation was completed on 21 December and the holiday stand down period began with a children's Christmas party held on board.
