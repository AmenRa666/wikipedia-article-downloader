'''HMCS ''Corner Brook''''' is a long-range hunter-killer [[submarine]] (SSK) of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]. She is the former Royal Navy ''Upholder''-class submarine '''HMS ''Ursula'' (S42)''', purchased from the British at the end of the Cold War. She is the third boat of the [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine|''Victoria'' class]] and is named after the city of [[Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador|Corner Brook]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].

==Design==
As built the ''Upholder''/''Victoria'' class was designed as a replacement for the {{sclass-|Oberon|submarine|4}} for use as hunter-killer and training subs. The submarines, which have a single-skinned, teardrop-shaped hull, [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|2220|LT|t}} surfaced and {{convert|2455|LT|t}} submerged.&lt;ref name=gardiner532&gt;Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 532&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=saunders88&gt;Saunders, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; They are {{convert|230|ft|7|in|m|1}} [[Length overall|long overall]] with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|25|ft|0|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|17|ft|8|in|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=gardiner532/&gt;

The submarines are powered by a one shaft diesel-electric system. They are equipped with two [[Paxman Valenta]] 1600 RPS SZ [[diesel engine]]s each driving a {{convert|1.4|MW|lk=on|adj=on}} GEC electric alternator with two 120-cell [[chloride batteries]].&lt;ref name=gardiner532/&gt;&lt;ref name=perkins196&gt;Perkins, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The batteries have a 90-hour endurance at {{convert|3|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=perkins196/&gt;  The ship is propelled by a {{convert|4.028|MW|adj=on}} GEC dual [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] electric motor turning a seven-blade fixed pitch propeller.&lt;ref name=perkins196/&gt; They have a {{convert|200|LT|t|adj=on}} [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] capacity. This gives the subs a maximum speed of {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|20|kn}} submerged. They have a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|8|kn}} and {{convert|10000|nmi}} at [[Submarine snorkel|snort]]ing depth.&lt;ref name=gardiner532/&gt;&lt;ref name=cocker123&gt;Cocker, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; They have a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|8|kn}}.&lt;ref name=gardiner532/&gt; The class has a reported dive depth of over {{convert|650|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=saunders88/&gt;

The ''Upholder''/''Victoria'' class are armed with six {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s. In British service, the submarines were equipped with 14 [[Tigerfish (torpedo)|Tigerfish Mk 24 Mod 2 torpedoes]] and four [[Harpoon (missile)|UGM-84 Sub-Harpoon missiles]].&lt;ref name=gardiner532/&gt; They could also be adapted for use as a [[minelayer]].&lt;ref name=cocker123/&gt; The submarines have [[List of radars#United Kingdom|Type 1007]] [[radar]] and Type 2040, Type 2019, Type 2007 and Type 2046 [[sonar]] installed.&lt;ref name=gardiner532/&gt; The hull is fitted with elastomeric acoustic tiles to reduce acoustic signature.&lt;ref name=saunders88/&gt; In British service the vessels had a complement of 7 officers and 40 ratings.&lt;ref name=gardiner532/&gt;

===Refits and Canadian alterations===
During the refit for Canadian service, the Sub-Harpoon and [[naval mine|mine]] capabilities were removed and the submarines were equipped with the Lockheed Martin Librascope Submarine [[fire-control system]] (SFCS) to meet the operational requirements of the Canadian Navy. Components from the fire control system of the ''Oberon''-class submarines were installed.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the submarines the ability to fire the Gould [[Mark 48 torpedo|Mk 48 Mod 4 torpedo]].&lt;ref name=saunders88/&gt; In 2014, the Government of Canada purchased 12 upgrade kits that will allow the submarines to fire the Mk 48 Mod 7AT torpedoes.&lt;ref name=dw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/canadian-government-to-spend-41-million-for-torpedo-upgrade-kits-for-submarines |title=Canadian government to spend $41 million for torpedo upgrade kits for submarines |last=Pugliese |first=David |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen |date=26 September 2014 |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These radar and sonar systems were later upgraded with the installation of the BAE Type 2007 array and the Type 2046 towed array.&lt;ref name=gardiner532/&gt;&lt;ref name=saunders88/&gt; The Canadian Towed Array Sonar (CANTASS) has been integrated into the towed sonar suite.&lt;ref name=saunders88/&gt; The ''Upholder''-class submarines were equipped with the CK035 electro-optical search periscope and the CH085 optronic attack periscope, originally supplied by Pilkington Optronics.&lt;ref name=saunders88/&gt;&lt;ref name=perkins196/&gt; After the Canadian refit, the submarines were equipped with Canadian communication equipment and [[Electronic warfare support measures|electronic support measures]] (ESM). This included two SSE decoy launchers and the AR 900 ESM.&lt;ref name=saunders88/&gt;

==Construction and career==
The submarine was laid down as HMS ''Ursula'' at [[Cammell Laird]]'s [[Birkenhead]] yard on 10 January 1989.&lt;ref name=Wertheim/&gt; She was launched on 28 February 1991 and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 8 May 1992.&lt;ref name=Wertheim/&gt; ''Ursula'' was decommissioned on 16 October 1994.&lt;ref name=Wertheim/&gt;

Looking to discontinue the operation of diesel-electric boats, the British government offered to sell ''Ursula'' and her sister submarines to Canada in 1993.&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;Ferguson, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; The offer was accepted in 1998.&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; The four boats were leased to the Canadians for US$427 million (plus US$98 million for upgrades and alteration to Canadian standards), with the lease to run for eight years; the submarines would then be sold for £1.&lt;ref name=Wertheim&gt;Wertheim, pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems were discovered with the piping welds on all four submarines, which delayed the reactivation of ex-''Ursula'' and her three sisters. The former ''Ursula'' was handed over to the Canadian Forces on 21 February 2003, and commissioned as HMCS ''Corner Brook'' on 26 June 2003.&lt;ref name=Wertheim/&gt;

===Royal Canadian Navy===
After commissioning, ''Corner Brook'' was deployed on the east coast of Canada, based out of Halifax.&lt;ref name=nd/&gt;
During a refit in 2006, elevated levels of lead were detected aboard the submarine; they were believed to come from the lead-brick ballast blocks used aboard ''Corner Brook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3aef6c8d3f-8212-463a-bfec-e5be05cc45c3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between October 2006 and January 2008, ''Corner Brook'' was active for only 81 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3a95467618-62e2-4147-a111-a1821f9d15f6]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100321164415/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3a95467618-62e2-4147-a111-a1821f9d15f6 |date=March 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The submarine participated in NATO exercise 'Noble Mariner' during May 2007.&lt;ref name=Blakeley&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/cms/3/3-a_eng.asp?category=7&amp;id=626 |title=Trail breakers in the North |last=Blakeley |first=Darlene |publisher=Canadian Navy |accessdate=14 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628112013/http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/cms/3/3-a_eng.asp?category=7 |archivedate=June 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the exercise, which occurred in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region, ''Corner Brook'' successfully closed with the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|R06|6}} without being detected.&lt;ref name=Blakeley/&gt; The submarine returned to Canada, and in August, she participated in [[Operation Nanook (2007)|Operation Nanook]], a sovereignty exercise held in and around Iqaluit and the Baffin Island coastal and the Hudson Strait areas.&lt;ref name=Blakeley/&gt;&lt;ref name=nd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy-marine.forces.gc.ca/en/fleet-units/cornerbrook-history.page |title=Her Majesty’s Canadian Ship (HMCS) Corner Brook (SSK 878) |work=Royal Canadian Navy |publisher=Government of Canada |date=30 July 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, ''Corner Brook'' participated in the [[NATO]] exercise &quot;Noble Warrior&quot;, marking the first time in 15 years that a Canadian submarine had been present in European waters.

In February 2008, ''Corner Brook'' departed from Halifax during a snowstorm for a three-month deployment to the Caribbean Sea.&lt;ref name=crowsnest&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/cms_gallery/acrobat_e.asp?pdf=/cms_images/news/story_images/crowsnest_v2-i2.pdf |title=Submarine excels in both warm and cold waters |date=Summer 2008 |work=Crows Nest |publisher=Maritime Command |pages=6–7 |accessdate=14 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613033324/http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/cms_gallery/acrobat_e.asp?pdf=/cms_images/news/story_images/crowsnest_v2-i2.pdf |archivedate=June 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the deployment, the submarine operated with the United States [[Joint Interagency Task Force South]], which attempts to counter drug trafficking, people smuggling and piracy in the region.&lt;ref name=crowsnest/&gt; ''Corner Brook'' returned to Halifax in May.&lt;ref name=crowsnest/&gt;

In January 2009, ''Corner Brook'' was the 'target' for submarine detection exercises performed by {{HMCS|Halifax|FFH 330|6}} and {{HMCS|Montréal|FFH 336|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/Commun/ml-fe/article-eng.asp?id=4110]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609135318/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/Commun/ml-fe/article-eng.asp?id=4110 |date=June 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a four-week, multi-ship training exercise in the North Atlantic during February and March,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2009/02/17/ns-warships-exercise.html |work=CBC News |title=Navy ships leave Halifax for training mission |date=17 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331220322/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2009/02/17/ns-warships-exercise.html |archivedate=March 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then participation in the [[UNITAS]] multinational exercise off Florida during late April and early May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayportmirror.com/stories/043009/may_multinational_001.xml.shtml] {{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During August, the submarine was involved in [[Operation Nanook (2009)|Operation Nanook 2009]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/canada-details-premier-annual-northern-sovereignty-operation,920215.shtml] {{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/business/Stephen+Harper+trip+reaffirms+Canada+Arctic+sovereignty/1901923/story.html] {{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducting covert surveillance patrols in the vicinity of Baffin Island.&lt;ref name=nd/&gt;

Early in 2011, ''Corner Brook'' took part in [[Operation Caribbe]], before transiting to the west coast as part of her redeployment to Esquimalt.&lt;ref name=nd/&gt; In June 2011 the submarine ran aground during manoeuvres off Vancouver Island. Two submariners were slightly injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/90050644?Canadian%20submarine%20runs%20aground%20near%20Vancouver%20Island/Canadian Submarine runs aground near Vancouver Island] AHN, June 6, 2011 {{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the grounding incident civilian and military submariners began pre-maintenance work on the submarine, in the expectation of an extended maintenance program. At the time, the process, length and cost of the work was unknown due to existing contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclocalnews.com/news/126186073.html |title=Investigation continues into sub crash |publisher=BC Local News |work=Goldstream News Gazette |last=McCracken |first=Erin |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A board of inquiry formed after the collision found that the cause of the collision had been human error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/12/16/bc-sub-accident-board-inquiry_n_1154914.html |title=B.C.

In February 2012, post-collision photos of the dry-docked submarine were published, showing extensive damage to the bow; the media also cited unofficial sources, saying the pressure hull may be damaged beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2012/02/13/ns-hmcs-corner-brook-damage.html |title=HMCS Corner Brook collision damage extensive |work=CBC News |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2014, ''Corner Brook'' began her Extended Docking Work Period (EDWP)&lt;ref name=nd/&gt; that was expected to take until 2017 to complete.&lt;ref name=oc1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/canadian-navy-looking-for-more-money-to-keep-subs-at-sea |title=Canadian navy gets more money to keep subs at sea |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen |last=Pugliese |first=David |date=25 September 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
