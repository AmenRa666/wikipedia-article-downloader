The '''2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team''' is a unit of the [[Pennsylvania Army National Guard]]’s [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Division]].  2nd Brigade’s headquarters is in [[Washington, Pennsylvania]], and the [[brigade]] also contains units from [[Ohio]] and [[Maryland]].

==History==
Headquarters, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team was organized in July, 1872 as a [[Company (military unit)|company]] called the Washington Guards.  In November, 1873 the company was formally incorporated into the Pennsylvania National Guard as Company H, 10th Pennsylvania Infantry [[Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Association of the 110th Infantry, [https://archive.org/stream/historyof110thin00asso#page/n19/mode/2up/search/%22washington+guards%22 History of the 110th Infantry], 1920, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Company H was mobilized for the [[Spanish–American War]] from 1898 to 1899 and served in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Adjutant General, [https://archive.org/stream/recordofpennsylvo00penn#page/434/mode/2up  Record of Pennsylvania Volunteers in the Spanish-American War, 1898-1899], 1901, page 424&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1916 the company was federalized for service on the [[Mexico–United States border]] during the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;George Thornton Fleming, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1M8wAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=10th+pennsylvania+infantry+texas+border+1916&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NrVxsRNwo0&amp;sig=r701KEvRIbNNZecf0Rv7nj7VFEo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7dLNUYqHEdTG4AO654GACQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=10th%20pennsylvania%20infantry%20texas%20border%201916&amp;f=false History of Pittsburgh and Environs], 1922, page 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917 Company H merged with Company H, 3rd Infantry Regiment, and the new unit was designated Company H, 110th [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry]] Regiment.  From August, 1917 to June, 1920 the 110th Infantry was mobilized for service in France during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Earle Lutz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TZTGAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=company+h+110th+pennsylvania+infantry+world+war+i&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oNPNUYmSHLjF4APPhYGQCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=company%20h&amp;f=false The 110th infantry in the world war], 1919, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Company H, 110th Infantry was inducted into federal service for World War II in February, 1942.  It served with the 28th Infantry Division in the [[European theatre of World War II|European Theater]], and was demobilized in October, 1945.

In September, 1950 Company H was activated for service during the [[Korean War]], and remained mobilized in West Germany until June, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Reporter'', [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=olNdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qVsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1305,5815468&amp;dq=washington+110th+pennsylvania+infantry&amp;hl=en 110th Infantry Federalized for Fifth Time], 9 September 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

Company H was re-designated Company C, 1st Battle Group, 110th Infantry as part of a 1959 reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Observe''r, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=StJdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l14NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=655,5802885&amp;dq=washington+110th+pennsylvania+infantry&amp;hl=en 110th Infantry Ends Enlistment Freeze], 23 February 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 Company C was combined with Headquarters, 1st Battle Group, and the new unit was designated Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 28th Infantry Division.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Reporter'', [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zYZiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o3cNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2868,1480312&amp;dq=2nd+brigade+28th+division&amp;hl=en Guard Units to be Reduced], 15 March 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 the 2nd Brigade Headquarters was reorganized as the 689th [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police Company]].&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Observer-Reporter'', [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mcddAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z14NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=856,3696644&amp;dq=689th+military+police+company&amp;hl=en Waynesburg Guard Unit has no Word on Call Up], 29 January 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1970s, another reorganization led to the creation of the 408th [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|General Supply]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Observer-Reporter'', [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JNFdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cV4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1107,4584242&amp;dq=408th+general+supply+company&amp;hl=en 408th Highly Specialized Guard Unit], 28 June 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The 408th General Supply Company was again designated Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 28th Infantry Division as the result of a 1975 reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;John B.
