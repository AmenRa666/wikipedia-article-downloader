The '''Theme of Dalmatia''' ({{lang-el|θέμα Δαλματίας/Δελματίας}}, ''thema Dalmatias/Delmatias'') was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] (a military-civilian province) on the eastern coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] in [[Southeastern Europe]], headquartered at Jadera (later called Zara and now [[Zadar]]).

==Origins==

Dalmatia first came under Byzantine control in the 530s, when the generals of Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527–565) seized it from the [[Ostrogoths]] in the [[Gothic War (535-554)|Gothic War]]. The invasions of the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] in the 7th century destroyed the main cities and overran much of the hinterland, with Byzantine control limited to the islands and certain new coastal cities -with local autonomy and called [[Dalmatian City-States]]- such as [[Split, Croatia|Spalatum]] and [[Dubrovnik|Ragusium]], while Jadera became the local episcopal and administrative center, under an ''[[archon]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|pp=578–579}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These coastal cities were the refuge of the autochthonous [[Dalmatian Italians|Dalmatian neolatins]], who created the original eight [[Dalmatian city-states]] (Vecla, Crespa, Arba, Jadera, Tragurium, Spalatum, Ragusium and Cattaro).

At the turn of the 8th to 9th century, Dalmatia was seized by [[Charlemagne]] (r. 768–814), but he returned it to the Byzantines in 812, after the so-called &quot;''[[Pax Nicephori]]''&quot;. It is unclear whether the region was under actual rather than nominal Byzantine authority after that; the local Latin cities appear to have been virtually independent. Nevertheless, an ''archon'' of Dalmatia is mentioned in the 842/843 ''[[Taktikon Uspensky]]'', and a seal of a &quot;''[[strategos]]'' of Dalmatia&quot; dated to the first half of the century may indicate the existence of a Dalmatian [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]], at least for a short time.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOAKS&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nesbitt|Oikonomides|1991|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The traditional date of the establishment of Dalmatia as a regular theme is placed in the early years of the reign of Emperor [[Basil I the Macedonian]] (r. 867–886), following the [[Siege of Ragusa (866–868)|expeditions]] of [[Niketas Oryphas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DOAKS&quot;/&gt;

Byzantium, the Roman Pope and the Franks vied for the support of the Slavs in Dalmatia; in 878 AD, [[Zdeslav of Croatia]] was a noted Byzantine vassal, who deposed and was in turn deposed in a power struggle involving these powers. With the fall of the [[Carolingian Empire]], the Franks ceased to be a major power in the Adriatic, while the [[Republic of Venice]] grew in power in Dalmatia, beginning with Doge [[Pietro Tradonico]].

Around 923 AD, [[Tomislav of Croatia]], the Byzantine Emperor and the two church patriarchs were involved a deal that transferred the control of the Byzantine Dalmatian cities to the new [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatian kingdom]]. This started a series of similar maneuvers and the [[Croatian–Bulgarian Wars]], during which the Byzantine Emperors of the [[Macedonian dynasty]] maintained varying degrees of control over the Dalmatian cities. The Church also endured an analogous internal conflict between the rival dioceses of [[Archbishopric of Split (early medieval)|Split]] and [[Archdiocese of Nin|Nin]]. The Venetian maritime power was obstructed by the [[Narentines]] and the Croats until [[Pietro II Orseolo]] who successfully intervened in 998 and 1000, and arranged two important royal marriages with both the Croats and the Byzantines. Under [[Domenico I Contarini]], Venice retook [[Zadar|Jadera]].

Croatia had another brief period of control over the Dalmatian city-states under [[Peter Krešimir IV]], but the invasion of the [[Normans]] shifted the balance of power back to the Venetians. Indeed, in 1075 AD the Norman ''Count Amico'' invaded Croatia from southern Italy, on behalf of the Dalmatian cities (by invitation to protect them from Croatian domination). Amico besieged [[Rab|Arbe]] for almost a month (late April to early May). He failed to take the island, but he allegedly did manage to capture the Croatian king himself (whose mother was the daughter of Doge [[Pietro Orseolo II|Pietro Orseolo]]) at an unidentified location. In return for liberation, he was forced to relinquish many cities, including both his Croatian capitals, as well as Zara, [[Split (city)|Spalatum]], and [[Trogir|Tragurium]]. However, over the next two years, the Venetians banished the Normans and secured the Dalmatian cities for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;N. Klaić, I. Petricioli, ''Zadar u srednjem vijeku do 1409.'', Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south of the Dalmatia Theme, the city of [[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa (Dubrovnik)]], one of the main Dalmatian city-states but still under Byzantine control, started to grow in importance, and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dubrovnik|its Church diocese]] was elevated to an archbishopric in 998 AD.

In the early 11th century, Byzantine control over the eight Dalmatian city-states started to be contested by the Serbian principality of [[Duklja]], whose ruler [[Jovan Vladimir]] took control of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], near the border with the [[Theme of Dyrrhachium]]. His feats were repeated and bested by [[Stefan Vojislav]] twenty years later, and in 1034 AD, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Bar diocese]] was elevated to an archdiocese, but a war with [[Theophilos Erotikos]] soon followed. Stefan Vojislav's son [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] obtained papal support following the [[East–West Schism]] of 1054, further weakening Byzantine influence in Dalmatia.

Except for Ragusium and the southern third of Dalmatia, Byzantine control collapsed in the 1060s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB&quot;/&gt; [[Constantine Bodin]] pledged his support for [[Pope Urban II]], which confirmed Bar's status as an archdiocese in 1089 AD, and resulted in a temporary demotion of the Ragusan diocese. By the end of the 11th century, the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] took the Kingdom of Croatia's place in controlling the northern Dalmatian hinterland. Duklja remained largely under Byzantine control, with a series of internal conflicts weakening its leaders.

Byzantine predominance was restored under Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (r. 1143–1180), but vanished after his death and was replaced by [[Venetian Empire|Venetian]] control.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB&quot;/&gt; With the rise of [[Stefan Nemanja]], the [[Nemanjić dynasty]] took control of the lands in the south of coastal Dalmatia, while nearly all the Dalmatian islands and coastal north-central Dalmatia was under [[Venetian Dalmatia|full Venetian control]] since the 13th century.
