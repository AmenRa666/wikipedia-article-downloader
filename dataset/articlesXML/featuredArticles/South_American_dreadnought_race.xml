{{South American dreadnought race}}
A naval [[arms race]] among [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]]—the most powerful and wealthy countries in [[South America]]—began in the early twentieth century when the Brazilian government ordered three &quot;[[dreadnought]]s&quot;, formidable [[battleship]]s whose capabilities far outstripped older vessels in the world's navies.

In 1904, the [[Brazilian Navy]] found itself well behind the [[Argentine Navy|Argentine]] and [[Chilean Navy|Chilean]] navies in quality and total tonnage; few ships had been ordered since the fall of the Brazilian emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] in 1889 and subsequent naval rebellions [[Revolta da Armada|in 1891 and 1893–94]], while its continental rivals Argentina and Chile had just concluded a [[Argentine–Chilean naval arms race|fifteen-year naval arms race]] which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber brought the Brazilian government a large increase in revenue, and they voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. They believed that building a strong navy would play an essential role in their goal of making the country an international power.

The Brazilian government ordered three small battleships from the British company [[Armstrong Whitworth]] in late 1905, but the appearance of the revolutionary British warship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906 quickly scrapped these plans.{{efn-ua|''cf.'' [[Pre-dreadnought battleship#Obsolescence|&quot;Obsolescence&quot;]] in [[Pre-dreadnought battleship]].}} Instead, the Brazilians ordered three {{sclass-|Minas Geraes|battleship|0}} dreadnoughts—a warship type which quickly became a measure of international prestige, similar to nuclear weapons today. This action focused the world's attention on the newly ascendant country: newspapers and politicians in the great powers fretted that Brazil would sell the ships to a belligerent nation, while the Argentine and Chilean governments immediately canceled their naval-limiting pact and ordered two dreadnoughts each (the {{sclass-|Rivadavia|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Almirante Latorre|battleship|4}}es, respectively).

Meanwhile, Brazil's third dreadnought faced a good deal of political opposition after an economic downturn and a [[#Brazilian naval revolt|naval revolt]]: the crews of both of their brand-new battleships, along with several smaller warships, mutinied and threatened to fire on Rio de Janeiro if there was no end to what they called the &quot;slavery&quot; being practiced by the Brazilian Navy. Despite these pressures, Armstrong successfully held the Brazilians to their contractual obligations. Construction on the new ship, preliminarily named [[Brazilian battleship Rio de Janeiro (1913)|''Rio de Janeiro'']], was halted several times due to repeated design changes. Brazil's coffee and rubber booms collapsed soon after. Concerned that their ship would be outclassed by larger [[super-dreadnought]]s, they sold the incomplete vessel to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in December 1913.

The [[First World War]] marked the end of the naval arms race, as the South American countries found themselves unable to purchase additional warships. The Brazilian government ordered a new battleship, [[#Riachuelo|''Riachuelo'']], in May 1914, but the conflict effectively canceled the ship. The British purchased the two Chilean battleships before they were completed; one was sold back to Chile in 1920. Argentina's two dreadnoughts, having been built in the neutral United States, escaped this fate and were commissioned in 1914–15. Although several South American [[#Aftermath: post-war expansions|post-war naval expansion plans]] called for dreadnoughts, no additional units were constructed.

Conflicting Argentine and Chilean claims to [[Patagonia]], the southernmost region in South America, had been causing tension between the two countries since the 1840s. This tension was heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant ships which had been licensed to operate in the disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]]. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty. Each government was distracted in the next few years, Argentina's with intensified [[Conquest of the Desert|military operations against the indigenous population]] (1870–84), and Chile's with the [[War of the Pacific]] (''Guerra del Pacífico'', 1879–83) against Bolivia and Peru. Still, several warships were ordered by both nations: the Chileans ordered a [[protected cruiser]], {{ship|Chilean cruiser|Esmeralda|1883|2}}, while the Argentines contracted for two warships, the [[central battery ship|central battery]] [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] {{ship|ARA|Almirante Brown|1880|2}} and protected cruiser [[ARA Patagonia (1885)|''Patagonia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45–46, 347; Garrett, &quot;Beagle Channel,&quot; 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, the Chilean government added [[Pound sterling|£]]3,129,500 to the budget for its fleet, at the time still centered on two aging central battery ironclads, {{ship|Chilean ironclad|Almirante Cochrane||2}} and {{ship|Chilean ironclad|Blanco Encalada||2}}, from the 1870s. They ordered the battleship {{ship|Chilean battleship|Capitán Prat||2}}, two protected cruisers, and two [[torpedo boat]]s; their [[keel laying|keels were laid]] in 1890. The Argentine government quickly responded with an order for two battleships, [[ARA Independencia (1891)|''Independencia'']] and {{Interlanguage link multi|ARA Libertad (1890)|es|3=ARA Libertad (1892)|lt=''Libertad''}}, beginning a naval [[arms race]] between the two countries. It continued through the 1890s, even after the expensive [[Chilean Civil War of 1891|Chilean Civil War]] (1891). The two countries alternated cruiser orders between 1890 and 1895, each marking a small increase in capabilities from the ship previous. Argentina escalated the race in July 1895 by buying an [[armored cruiser]], {{ship|ARA|Garibaldi||2}}, from Italy. Chile responded by ordering its own armored cruiser, {{ship|Chilean cruiser|O'Higgins|1897|2}}, and six torpedo boats; the Argentine government quickly ordered another armored cruiser from the Italian engineering company [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.|Ansaldo]], and later ordered two more.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45–49, 297–98, 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

The race slowed for a few years after [[Puna de Atacama dispute|a boundary dispute in the Puna de Atacama]] region was successfully mediated in 1899 by the [[United States Ambassador to Argentina|American ambassador to Argentina]], [[William Paine Lord]], but more ships were ordered by both countries in 1901. The Argentine Navy bought two more armored cruisers from Italy, and the Chilean Navy replied with orders for two ''Constitución''-class [[pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]] battleships from British shipyards. The Argentines replied by signing letters of intent with Ansaldo in May 1901 to buy two larger battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing dispute disturbed members of the British government, as war looked like a very real possibility, and an armed conflict would disrupt the extensive British commercial interests in the area. Argentina and Chile both imported British-made goods, while the United Kingdom imported large amounts of Argentine grain, most shipped through the River Plate, and Chilean nitrates.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 52; Massie, ''Castles'', 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government mediated negotiations between the two countries through their [[Envoy (title)|envoy]] in Chile. These [[Pacts of May|were successfully concluded]] on 28 May 1902 with three pacts. The third limited the naval armaments of both countries; both were barred from acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other eighteen months' advance notice. The warships under construction were sold to the United Kingdom and Japan: Chile's battleships became the former's {{sclass-|Swiftsure|battleship|4}}, and Argentina's armored cruisers the latter's {{sclass-|Kasuga|cruiser|4}}. It is not clear if the two planned Argentine battleships were ordered, but in any case the plans were quickly scuttled. ''Capitán Prat'', ''Garibaldi'', and ''Pueyrredón'' were disarmed with the exception of their main batteries, as there was no crane capable of removing the cruisers' gun turrets.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 49–52; Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazilian decline and re-emergence ===
{{See also|Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil|First Brazilian Republic}}
Brazil's navy fell into disrepair and obsolescence after an [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil#Republican coup|1889 revolution]], which deposed [[Politics of the Empire of Brazil|Emperor]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], [[Revolta da Armada|two naval revolts]] (1891 and 1893–94), the [[Federalist Riograndense Revolution (Brazil)|Federalist Revolution]] (1893–95), and the [[War of Canudos]] (1896–97).&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 148; Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 56, 67; Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 133; Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 32; Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 240.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|In 1893, Rear Admiral [[Custódio José de Mello]], the minister of the navy, revolted against President [[Floriano Peixoto]], bringing nearly all of the Brazilian warships currently in the country with him. Mello's forces took [[Florianópolis|Desterro]] when the governor surrendered, and began to coordinate with secessionists in the southern province of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], but loyal Brazilian forces overwhelmed them both. Most of the rebel naval forces were sailed to Argentina, where their crews surrendered; the flagship, {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Aquidabã||2}}, held out near Desterro until it was sunk by a torpedo boat.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 67–76, 352.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The navy had just forty-five percent of its authorized personnel in 1896, and the only modern armored ships were two small coast-defense vessels launched in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 16; Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare'', 216; Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 403.&lt;/ref&gt; With such dilapidated defenses, [[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco|José Paranhos Jr., the Baron of Rio Branco]] and [[Foreign Minister of Brazil]], stated &quot;In such conditions, you ... understand how upset I am and all the worries I have. All that still protects [Brazil] is the moral force and old prestige still left from [the Imperial era] when there was still foresight in this land...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Viana Filho, ''A vida do Barão do Rio Branco'', 445.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|A professional diplomat and the son of the famed [[José Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco|Viscount of Rio Braco]], the Baron of Rio Branco was named as Brazil's Foreign Minister in 1902 after a distinguished career as a diplomat, and served there until his death in 1912. In that time, he oversaw the signing of many treaties and mediated territorial disputes between Brazil and its neighbors, and became a famous name in his own right.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meanwhile, although the Argentine–Chilean agreement had limited their naval expansion, they still retained the numerous vessels built in the interim,&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45–52; Garrett, &quot;Beagle Channel,&quot; 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; so by the turn of the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 50–51; Martins, &quot;Colossos do mares,&quot; 75; Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's huge advantage in population—it had almost three times the population of Argentina, close to five times that of Chile, and nearly double of the two combined—led the Brazilian government to believe that it should assume a leading role in naval affairs on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 403; Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 32.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The countries' actual naval tonnages were {{convert|36896|LT|t}} for Chile, {{convert|34425|LT|t}} for Argentina, and {{convert|27661|LT|t}} for Brazil, while the populations were estimated by Livermore at three&amp;nbsp;million, five&amp;nbsp;million, and fourteen&amp;nbsp;million, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore32&quot;&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the population statistics are significant, this needs to be put into its proper economic context: [[Angus Maddison]] and the scholars continuing his work in quantitative [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] history have shown that Argentina and Chile's 1904 [[gross domestic product]] per capita were $3,191 and $2,287 (respectively) in 1990 [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]], juxtaposed against just $713 for Brazil. These are four-and-a-half and three times greater than Brazil's. By 1910, the disparity had grown: Argentina and Chile's GDP per capita was five and four times larger, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maddison&quot;&gt;Bolt and van Zanden, &quot;Maddison Project.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The late nineteenth and early twentieth century demand for coffee and rubber led to Brazil's so-called &quot;[[Coffee production in Brazil#History|coffee economy]]&quot; and &quot;[[rubber boom]].&quot; At the time, it was estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil, particularly in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Minas Gerais|Minas Geraes]], and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. The resulting profits meant that the Brazilian government collected much more revenue than in previous years.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, &quot;Coffee 'Valorization',&quot; 528–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, there was an effort on the part of prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably [[Pinheiro Machado (politician)|Pinheiro Machado]] and Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 14; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Congress of Brazil]] passed a large naval acquisition program on 14 December 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered or purchased, and while Rio Branco suggested purchasing used warships to fill the gap, nothing came of it. By 1906, two factions had developed over which types of ships should be ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80; Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 156–58; Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 403; Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 240.&lt;/ref&gt; One, supported by the British armament company [[Armstrong Whitworth]] (which eventually received the order), favored a navy centered on a small number of large warships. The other, supported by Rio Branco, preferred a larger navy composed of smaller warships.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80; Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 80, 128, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Rio Branco, in support of this measure, stated that &quot;with six small battleships we would be much better. If we lost one or two in combat, there would be still four or five left to fight with. But with three [larger battleships]? With two damaged or destroyed, we would be left with one only.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Viana Filho, ''A vida do Barão do Rio Branco'', 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the smaller warships faction prevailed. After Law no. 1452 was passed on 30 December 1905, which authorized £4,214,550 for new warship construction (£1,685,820 in 1906), three small battleships, three [[armored cruiser]]s, six [[destroyer]]s, twelve [[torpedo boat]]s, three [[submarine]]s, a [[Collier (ship)|collier]], and a [[training ship]] were ordered.&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 108; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80; Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 133; Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 147; Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 75, 78; Alger, &quot;Professional Notes,&quot; 1051–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Brazilian government later eliminated the armored cruisers for monetary reasons, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral {{Interlanguage link multi|Júlio César de Noronha|pt}}, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for the planned battleships on 23 July 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 80; Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 240–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British ambassador to Brazil was opposed to the planned naval expansion, even though the orders went to a British company, for its large cost and its negative effects on relations between Brazil and Argentina.

After construction began on Brazil's three new small battleships, the Brazilian government reconsidered their order and chosen battleship design (something that would happen [[#Reciprocation: Brazil orders again|several more times]] during the construction of [[HMS Agincourt (1913)|''Rio de Janeiro'']] in 1913). This was wrought by the impact of the [[Battle of Tsushima]], which led navies to believe that larger guns were necessary, and the debut of the United Kingdom's new [[dreadnought]] concept, represented by the surprisingly fast construction and [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|the eponymous ship]] in 1906, rendered the Brazilian ships obsolete before they were completed.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 81; Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 246; &quot;Brazilian Battleship 'Minas Geraes'—Most Powerful Fighting Ship Afloat,&quot; ''Scientific American'', 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian order for what contemporary commentators called &quot;the most powerful battleship[s] in the world&quot; came at a time when few countries in the world had contracted for such armament.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Mystery of the Great Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; ''World's Work'', 10867; Earle, &quot;Professional Notes,&quot; 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil was the third country to have a dreadnought under construction, behind the United Kingdom, with {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|2}} and the {{sclass-|Bellerophon|battleship|4}}, and the United States, with the {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship|4}}. This meant that Brazil was in line to have a dreadnought before many of the world's perceived powers, like [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the [[Empire of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, ''Battleships'', 320; Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 404; Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare'', 216.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|In reality, the first German dreadnought was commissioned on 1 October 1909, about three months before Brazil's ''Minas Geraes'' was completed, despite being laid down two months after the Brazilian ship.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, &quot;Germany,&quot; 145; Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 403.&lt;/ref&gt;}} As dreadnoughts were quickly equated with international status, somewhat similar to [[nuclear weapon]]s today—that is, regardless of a state's need for such equipment, simply ordering and possessing a dreadnought increased the owner's prestige—the order caused a major stir in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 15; Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare'', 227–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The question that is puzzling diplomats the world over is why Brazil should want ferocious leviathans of such size and armament and speed as to place them ten to fifteen years in advance of any other nation besides Great Britain.

Rio Branco, through a [[telegram]] sent to the Brazilian ambassador to the United States [[Joaquim Nabuco]], based his counter-argument in the close relationship between Brazilian and American governments, saying &quot;The old and cordial friendship between our countries is known, as well as the excellent relations existing between their governments. [...] Every sensible person will understand that an honest and respectable government would not lend itself to play the part attributed to Brazil by the inventor of the news.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Reported Purchase of Battleships,&quot; ''Navy'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the event of war, the government which would first be able to secure these vessels… would immediately place the odds of naval supremacy in its favor. England, no matter how many Dreadnoughts she has, would be compelled to buy them to keep them from some lesser power. They bring a new question into international politics. They may be leaders of a great fleet which minor government are said to be preparing to build; or, to put it more accurately, to stand sponsors for. Some Machiavellian hand may be at work in this new game of international politics and the British Admiralty is suspected. But every statesmen and naval student may make his own guess.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Mystery of the Great Brazilian Battleships,&quot; ''World's Work'', 10867–68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other side of the Atlantic, in the midst of the [[Anglo–German naval arms race]], members of the British [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] fretted over the battleships' possible destinations, though the Admiralty consistently stated that they did not believe any sale would occur. In mid-July and September 1908, the Commons discussed purchasing the ships to bolster the Royal Navy and ensure they would not be sold to a foreign rival, which would disrupt the British naval plan set in place by the &quot;[[Naval Defence Act 1889|two-power standard]],&quot; though in March and late July 1908, the Brazilian government officially denied any sale was planned.&lt;ref&gt;Трубицын, ''Линкоры'', 6; Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 246; &quot;Naval Policy,&quot; ''Times'' (London), 24 March 1908, 6e; &quot;Battleships for Brazil,&quot; ''Times'' (London), 12 May 1908, 4d; &quot;The Warships for Brazil,&quot; ''Times'' (London), 14 July 1908, 8c; &quot;Naval and Military Intelligence,&quot; ''Times'' (London), 18 July 1908, 12c; &quot;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19080912.2.100 British and Foreign News],&quot; ''Evening Post'' (Wellington), 12 September 1908, 13; &quot;Naval and Military Intelligence,&quot; ''Times'' (London), 22 March 1909, 9e.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1909, the British press and House of Commons began pushing for more dreadnoughts after the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Reginald McKenna]], asserted that Germany had stepped up its building schedule and would complete thirteen dreadnoughts in 1911—four more than previously estimated. Naturally, the subject of purchasing the Brazilian dreadnoughts already being built was brought up, and McKenna had to officially deny that the government was planning to tender an offer for the warships.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19090319&amp;id=r_ogAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cHUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5736,1907003 May Take Brazil's Ships], ''Day'' (New London), 19 March 1909, 7; &quot;The Brazilian Battleships,&quot; ''Times'' (London), 23 March 1909, 6d; &quot;House of Commons,&quot; ''Times'' (London), 23 March 1909, 12a; &quot;The Brazilian Battleships,&quot; ''Times'' (London), 25 March 1909, 7b; &quot;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjlVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cJUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7318,4022938 The Naval Scare],&quot; ''Sydney Mail'', 24 March 1909, 24; &quot;[http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Herald/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909%20-%202776.pdf England's Power on the Sea Safe],&quot; ''New York Herald'', 25 March 1909, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that a sale to a foreign nation would be inconsequential, as &quot;our present superiority in strength in 1909–10 is so great that no alarm would be created in the mind of the Board of Admiralty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Brazilian Battleships,&quot; ''Times'' (London), 25 March 1909, 7b.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the plethora of rumors, the Brazilian government was not planning to sell their ships. Dreadnoughts formed an important role in Rio Branco's goal of raising Brazil's international status:

{{quote|Brazil begins to feel the importance of her great position, the part she may play in the world, and is taking measures in a beginner's degree commensurate with that realization. Her battle-ship-building is one with her attitude at The Hague, and these together are but part and parcel, not of a vainglorious striving after position, but of a just conception of her future.  Dr. Ruy Barboza did not oppose the details of representation on the international arbitral tribunal out of antipathy to the United States, but because he believed that the sovereignty of Brazil was at least equal to that of any other sovereign nation, and because he was convinced that unequal representation on that tribunal would result in the establishment of 'categories of sovereignty'—a thing utterly opposed to the philosophy of equal sovereign rights.{{efn-ua|''cf''. &quot;[[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]]&quot; in [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]].}} And as in international law and discourse, so in her navy, Brazil seeks to demonstrate her sovereign rank.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mystery of the Brazilian 'Dreadnoughts',&quot; ''Literary Digest'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Argentina was highly alarmed by the Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the remaining months of the naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Трубицын, ''Линкоры'', 3; Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1906, Argentina's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Manuel Augusto Montes de Oca|es}}, remarked that any one of the new Brazilian vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Filho76&quot;&gt;Martins, &quot;Colossos do mares,&quot; 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the seeming hyperbole, his statement—made before the Brazilian government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new Brazilian warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, ''Dreadnought'', 72; Scheina, &quot;Argentina,&quot; 400.&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, the ''Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers'' opined that maintaining the older ''Libertad'' class or ''Capitán Prat'' (respectively) was now a waste of money.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Status of South American Navies,&quot; ''Naval Engineers'', 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine government's alarm continued under de Oca's successor, [[Estanislao Zeballos]]. In June 1908, Zeballos presented a plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to issue an ultimatum: if they did not comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, his plan was leaked to the media, and the resulting public outcry—Argentine citizens happened to not be in favor of their government borrowing large sums of money to mobilize the army and go to war—ensured his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsfeld, &quot;Falsificando telegramas,&quot; 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The end of Zeballos' tenure as Foreign Minister was extremely contentious, as another controversy closely linked to him began shortly after his resignation. The Argentine government, fearing a Brazilian–Chilean alliance, paid particular attention to the two countries' communications, leading to the now-famous Telegram no. 9. This communication, sent from the Brazilian government to their representatives in Chile, was intercepted by the Argentine government and supposedly decoded in Zeballos' last days as minister. It was read in a congressional session one day after Zeballos' departure, and the new Minister of Foreign Affairs claimed it was proof of intended Brazilian aggression against Argentina. The full but fraudulent contents of the telegram were released by Zeballos to the press, which kindled international disenchantment with Brazil. However, in a public relations coup, Rio Branco released the [[cipher]] and actual full contents of the telegram, which proved it contained no reference to belligerent Brazilian intents on Argentina. The actual telegram was then printed in several prominent Argentine newspapers. Zeballos was later accused of deliberately distorting or forging the telegram, though there was no definitive proof; it may have been his secretary. Whatever Zeballos' culpability, his actions in that June may have been motivated by a personal vendetta against Rio Branco, who had bested Zeballos on several occasions since 1875, most notably during a border dispute arbitrated by American President Grover Cleveland (the [[Question of Palms]], or ''Questão de Palmas'').&lt;ref&gt;Viana Filho, ''A vida do Barão do Rio Branco'', 441–44; Heinsfeld, &quot;Falsificando telegramas,&quot; 1–2, 5–10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Argentine government was also deeply concerned with the possible effect on the country's large export trade, as a Brazilian blockade of the entrance to the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] would cripple the Argentine economy. The acquisition of dreadnoughts to maintain an equal footing with Brazil would, in the words of the Argentine admiral overseeing his countries' dreadnoughts while they were being constructed, avoid a &quot;preponderance of power on the other side, where a sudden gust of popular feeling or injured pride might make [a blockade] a dangerous weapon against us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&amp;dat=19100604&amp;id=upU-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kVkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=805,4380508 A Message From Garcia],&quot; ''Boston Evening Transcript'', 4 June 1910, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both countries faced difficulty in financing their own dreadnoughts.

{{quote|We may assume that the British battleships embody good ideas and good practice—in all probability the very best. These cannot fail, in a greater or less degree, to become part of the design which the British shipbuilder first submits to the Argentine Government. In the second inquiry it may be presumed that everything that was good in the first proposals had been seized upon by the Argentine authorities and asked for in the new design. This second request went not only to British builders but to all the builders of the world, and in this way it is exceedingly probable that a serious leakage of ideas and practice of our ships was disseminated through the world by the Argentine government. ... The third inquiry that was issued showed to all the builders of the world what has been eliminated or modified in the second inquiry; and so the process of leakage went merrily on, and with it that of the education of foreign builders and the Argentine government.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 84.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The United States' [[Fore River Shipyard|Fore River Ship and Engine Company]] tendered the lowest bid—in part owing to the availability of cheap steel, though they were accused of quoting an unprofitable price so the ships could act as [[loss leader]]s—and was awarded the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, ''Big Battleship'', 22; Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This aroused further suspicion in the European bidders, who had previously believed that the United States was a non-contender, though Argentina did order twelve destroyers from British, French, and German shipyards to soften the blow.{{efn-ua|Four were ordered from each country, but only the German-built destroyers of the {{sclass-|Catamarca|destroyer|5}} and {{sclass-|La Plata|destroyer|4}}es would go on to serve in the Argentine Navy. Of the other eight, the British-built destroyers were purchased by Greece shortly before the [[First Balkan War]] (the ''Aetos'' or [[Wild Beast-class destroyer (1912)|Wild Beast class]]), and the French-built ships were taken over by that country at the outbreak of the First World War (the [[Aventurier-class destroyer|''Aventurier'' class]]).&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, &quot;Argentina,&quot; 400.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  These bidders, along with newspapers like the ''Times'' (London), turned their anger on the American government under President [[William Howard Taft]], whose so-called &quot;[[Dollar Diplomacy]]&quot; policy had led his State Department to go to great lengths to obtain the contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The United States offered Argentina certain economic and military concessions: the removal of import tariffs on [[hides]] from Argentina, an offer to release the Americans' most technologically advanced [[fire-control system]] and [[torpedo tube]]s for use on the Argentine ships, and promises for additional concessions if American shipbuilders were selected.

The Argentine contract included an [[Option (finance)|option]] for a third dreadnought in case the Brazilian government adhered to its contractual obligations to order a third dreadnought. Two newspapers, [[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|''La Prensa'']] and [[La Nación|''La Argentina'']], heavily advocated for a third ship; the latter even started a petition to raise money for a new battleship.&lt;ref name=Livermore44&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The American minister to Argentina, [[Charles H.

The Chilean government delayed their naval plans after a financial [[depression (economics)|depression]] brought on by the [[1906 Valparaíso earthquake]] and a drastic fall in the [[nitrate]] market in 1907, but these economic problems were not enough to stop them from countering the dreadnoughts purchased by their traditional rival Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Livermore and Grant, who cites Livermore's work, both attribute part of this delay to a 1908 earthquake,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 168; Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 40.&lt;/ref&gt; but no major earthquake hit Chile in that year, ''cf.'' [[List of earthquakes in Chile]]. However, the [[1906 Valparaíso earthquake|Valparaíso earthquake]] of 1906 caused nearly 4,000 deaths, a tsunami, and a wide swath of destruction over the Chilean capital and surrounding areas. Given this, and at least one primary source's confirmation that the plans were delayed by the Valparaíso earthquake,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Status of South American Navies,&quot; ''Naval Engineers'', 257.&lt;/ref&gt; it seems likely that Livermore's 1908 earthquake was a simple typographical error inadvertently repeated in Grant's account.}} While Argentina's principal concern was with Brazil, Chile also wished to respond to Peruvian military acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 146–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Money for a naval building program was allocated in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Acorazado Almirante Latorre,&quot; ''Unidades Navales''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Chilean government solicited bids from several armament companies, nearly all believed that a British company would win the contract; the American [[Military attaché|naval attaché]] opined that without anything short of a revolution the contracts were destined for the United Kingdom. The Chilean Navy had cultivated extensive ties with the United Kingdom's Royal Navy since the 1830s, when Chilean naval officers were given places on British ships to receive training and experience they could bring back to their country. This relationship had recently been cemented when a British [[naval mission]] was requested by Chile and sent in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the American and German governments attempted to swing sentiment to their side by dispatching modern naval vessels ({{USS|Delaware|BB-28|2}} and {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}, respectively) to Chilean ports. Their efforts were futile, and the design tendered by Armstrong Whitworth was chosen on 25 July 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other navies ===
Other South American navies, having limited resources and little expertise in operating large warships, were in no state to respond. The [[Peruvian Navy]], fourth largest on the continent, had been decimated during the [[Naval Campaign of the War of the Pacific|naval campaign]] of the [[War of the Pacific]] against Chile (1879–83). It took the Peruvian government more than twenty years to order new warships—the {{sclass-|Almirante Grau|cruiser|4}} ({{Interlanguage link multi|BAP Almirante Grau (1906)|es|lt=''Almirante Grau''}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|BAP Coronel Bolognesi (1906)|es|lt=''Coronel Bolognesi''}}), scout cruisers delivered in 1906 and 1907. They were augmented by two submarines and a destroyer ordered from France.&lt;ref&gt;Schenia, &quot;Peru,&quot; 409–10.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Almirante Grau'' was only intended to be the fleet's flagship until a more powerful warship was purchased; along with ''Coronel Bolognesi'', they would be the &quot;pioneers&quot; of a modern navy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;New Peruvian Warships,&quot; ''Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers'', 581–83.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Proceedings'' reported in 1905 that this new navy would be composed of three [[Swiftsure-class battleship|''Swiftsure'']]-like pre-dreadnoughts, three armored cruisers, six destroyers, and numerous smaller warships, all acquired as part of a nine-year, $7&amp;nbsp;million outlay.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fleets in Preparation,&quot; ''Proceedings'', 740.&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these plans came to fruition. The closest major expansion came in 1912, when the Peruvian Navy had an agreement to acquire an obsolete French armored cruiser in 1912 ({{ship|French cruiser|Dupuy de Lôme||2}}) for three million [[franc]]s. The Peruvian government paid one of a planned three planned installments, but the purchase came under criticism at home for not being able to change any balance of power with Chile. When a potential cruiser purchase by Ecuador fell through, the Peruvians quit paying for the ship, which was later converted to a merchant ship and scrapped in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Feron, &quot;The Cruiser Dupuy-de-Lôme,&quot; 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other South American navies also added smaller vessels to their naval forces in the same time period. The [[National Navy of Uruguay|Uruguayan Navy]] acquired a {{convert|1400|LT|t|0|adj=on}} gunboat in 1910, while the [[Bolivarian Armada of Venezuela|Venezuelan Navy]] bought an ex-Spanish {{convert|1125|LT|t|adj=on}} [[protected cruiser]], [[USS Isla de Cuba (1886)|''Mariscal Sucre'']], from the United States in 1912. The [[Ecuadorian Navy]] added a Chilean torpedo boat to its fleet in 1907, complementing its fleet of two [[aviso]]s, both around {{convert|800|LT|t}}, two small steamers, and one minor coast guard ship.&lt;ref&gt;Schenia, &quot;Ecuador,&quot; 414; Schenia, &quot;Uruguay,&quot; 424–25; Schenia, &quot;Venezuela,&quot; 425; &quot;The Status of South American Navies,&quot; ''Naval Engineers'', 254–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first Brazilian dreadnought, ''Minas Geraes'', was launched, the Brazilian government began an extended campaign to remove the third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the [[#Revolt of the Lash|Revolt of the Lash]] coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, due in part to lower bond rates that made it possible for the government to borrow the necessary money. ''Rio de Janeiro'' was laid down for the first time in March 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 247–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agincourt postcard.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|''Agincourt'' depicted prior to its British modifications, which included the removal of the flying bridge between the funnels seen here.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;Postcard [[:File:Agincourt postcard.jpg|courtesy]] of ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
By May, the Brazilian government asked Armstrong to stop work on the new warship and to submit new designs which took in the most recent advance in naval technology, [[super-dreadnought]]s. [[Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, 1st Baronet|Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt]] served as Armstrong's liaison to Brazil. The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] specifies this design as a {{convert|655|ft|m|adj=on}} long [[length overall|overall]], {{convert|32000|LT|t|adj=on}} ship mounting twelve 14-inch guns and costing near £3,000,000. The many requests made by the Brazilian Navy for minor changes delayed the contract signing until 10 October 1910, and the battleship's keel laying was delayed further by a [[Labor unrest|labor dispute]] with the [[Worshipful Company of Shipwrights]], which led to a [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]]. During these delays, a new Minister of the Navy, Admiral [[Marques Leão]], was appointed to replace de Alencar—an important development, as the contract stipulated that the design could only proceed with the approval of the new Minister. Again, however, the Brazilian Navy found itself torn between two schools of thought: Leão and others in the navy favored a reversion to the 12-inch gun, but others, led by the outgoing Minister of the Navy (de Alencar) and the head of the Brazilian naval commission in the United Kingdom (Rear Admiral {{Interlanguage link multi|Duarte Huet de Bacelar Pinto Guedes|pt}}), were strongly in favor of obtaining the ship with the largest armament—in this case, a design drawn up by Bacellar, carrying eight 16-inch guns, six 9.4-inch guns, and fourteen 6-inch guns.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 254–57, 260, 263–64, 268; ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed., ''s.v.'' &quot;Ship,&quot; 906.&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Eyncourt, who had departed Brazil in October immediately after the contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Leão had convinced the recently elected President [[Hermes da Fonseca|Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca]] to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns in favor of a smaller ship.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 269.&lt;/ref&gt; The credit may not have laid with Leão alone, though; da Fonseca was already dealing with multiple issues. Most importantly, he had to deal with [[#Brazilian naval revolt|the fallout]] from a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the [[Revolt of the Lash]]), which had seen three of the new vessels just purchased by the navy, along with one older coast-defense ship, mutiny against the use of corporal punishment in the navy.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make matters worse, the dreadnoughts' expense combined with loan payments and a worsening economy led to growing [[government debt]] compounded by [[Government budget deficit|budget deficits]]. By one measure of Brazil's [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]], income in the country rose from $718 in 1905 to a high of $836 in 1911 before declining over the next three years to a low of $780 in 1914 (both measured in 1990&amp;nbsp;[[Geary–Khamis dollar|international&amp;nbsp;dollars]]). It did not fully recover until after the First World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maddison&quot;/&gt; At the same time, Brazil's external and internal debt reached $500 and $335&amp;nbsp;million (respectively, in contemporaneous dollar amounts) by 1913, partly through rising deficits, which were $22&amp;nbsp;million in 1908 and $47&amp;nbsp;million by 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Latin America'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the president commented negatively on the new ship:

{{quote|When I assumed office, I found that my predecessor had signed a contract for the building of the battleship ''Rio de Janeiro'', a vessel of 32,000&amp;nbsp;tons, with an armament of 14-inch guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 354.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

D'Eyncourt probably avoided proposing any design with 16-inch guns when he saw the political situation. In meetings with Leão, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong as that of the ''Minas Geraes'' class, but a design with no less than ''fourteen'' 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the ''Minas Geraes'' class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

After numerous requests for design alterations from the Brazilian Navy were accommodated or rejected, a contract was signed for a ship with fourteen 12-inch guns on 3 June 1911 for £2,675,000, and ''Rio de Janeiro''{{'}}s keel was laid for the fourth time on 14 September. It did not take long for the Brazilian government to reconsider their decision again;&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Dreadnought,&quot; 284.&lt;/ref&gt; by mid-1912, battleships with 14-inch guns were under construction, and suddenly it seemed that ''Rio de Janeiro'' would be outclassed upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 133; Vanterpool, &quot;The 'Riachuelo',&quot; 140; Gill, &quot;Professional Notes,&quot; 492.&lt;/ref&gt; Making matters worse, a European depression after the end of the [[Second Balkan War]] in August 1913 reduced Brazil's ability to obtain foreign loans. This coincided with a collapse in Brazil's coffee and rubber exports, the latter due to the loss of the [[Rubber boom#The end of the Amazon's rubber monopoly|Brazilian rubber monopoly]] to British plantations in the Far East. The price of coffee declined by 20 percent and Brazilian exports of it dropped 12.5 percent between 1912 and 1913; rubber saw a similar decline of 25 and 36.6 percent, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Latin America and the War'', 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian Navy later claimed that selling ''Rio de Janeiro'' was a tactical decision, so they could have two divisions of battleships: two with 12-inch guns (the ''Minas Geraes'' class), and two with 15-inch guns.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, &quot;Professional Notes,&quot; 492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong studied whether replacing the 12-inch guns with seven 15-inch guns would be feasible, but Brazil was probably already attempting to sell the ship. In the tension building up to the First World War, many countries, including Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire, were interested in purchasing the ship. While Russia quickly dropped out, Italy and the rival Greeks and Ottomans were all highly interested. The Italians seemed close to purchasing the ship until the French government decided to back the Greeks—rather than allow the Italians, who were the principal naval rivals of the French, to obtain the ship. The Grecian government made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional £50,000, but as the Greeks worked to obtain an initial installment, the Ottoman government was also making offers.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian government rejected an Ottoman proposal to swap ships, with Brazil's ''Rio de Janeiro'' going to the Ottomans and [[Ottoman battleship Reşadiye|''Reşadiye'']] going to Brazil, presumably with some amount of money. The Brazilian government would only accept a monetary offer. Lacking this, the Ottomans were forced to find a loan. Fortunately for them, they were able to obtain one from French banker acting independent of his government, and the Ottoman Navy secured the ''Rio de Janeiro'' on 29 December 1913 for £1,200,000 as-is.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 284; Gill, &quot;Professional Notes,&quot; 555.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The surprise acquisition of ''Rio de Janeiro'' by the Ottomans alarmed the Greek government, due to what contemporary commentators called the &quot;[assured Ottoman] naval superiority over Greece.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkish Navy&quot;/&gt; The Greeks scrambled to put offers together for ''Almirante Latorre'' or one of the Argentine dreadnoughts to counter the Ottoman purchase, which would have given them two dreadnoughts by the end of 1914 (the other being ''Reşadiye'', later taken over by the British and renamed {{HMS|Erin||2}}).

=== ''Riachuelo'' ===
After selling ''Rio de Janeiro'', the Brazilian government asked Armstrong and Vickers to prepare designs for a new battleship, something strongly supported by the [[Navy League of Brazil]] (''Liga Maritima'').&lt;ref&gt;Oakenfull, ''Brazil'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong agreed to construct the ship without any further payments from Brazil. They replied with at least fourteen designs, six from Vickers (December 1913 through March 1914) and eight from Armstrong (February 1914). Vickers' designs varied between eight and ten 15-inch and eight 16-inch guns, with speeds between 22 and 25&amp;nbsp;knots (the lower-end ships having mixed firing, the higher using oil), and displacements between {{convert|26000|t|LT}} and {{convert|30500|t|LT}}. Armstrong took two basic designs, one with eight and the other with ten 15-inch guns, and varied their speed and firing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss285-86&quot;&gt;Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 285–86.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Topliss (1985), in writing a design history of the four Brazilian dreadnoughts, makes no mention of Vanterpool's (1969) article, which detailed four substantially different designs prepared in October 1913 by Armstrong.

=== Brazilian naval revolt ===
{{main article|Revolt of the Lash}}

In late November 1910, a large naval revolt, later named the [[Revolt of the Lash]], broke out in Rio de Janeiro.{{efn-ua|Other English translations include the &quot;Revolt of the Whip&quot; or the &quot;Revolt against the Lash.&quot;}} The tension was kindled by the racial makeup of the navy's regular crewmembers, who were heavily black or [[mulatto]], whereas their officers were mostly white.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, &quot;Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Baron of Rio Branco commented: &quot;For the recruitment of marines and enlisted men, we bring aboard the dregs of our urban centers, the most worthless ''lumpen'', without preparation of any sort. Ex-slaves and the sons of slaves make up our ships' crews, most of them dark-skinned or dark-skinned mulattos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco]], in Edmar Morel, ''A Revolta da Chibata'' 4th ed. (Rio de Janeiro: Edições Graal, 1986), 13, in Morgan, &quot;Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of [[impressment]], combined with the heavy use of [[corporal punishment]] for even minor offenses, meant that relations between the black crews and white officers was tepid at best. Crewmen aboard ''Minas Geraes'' began planning for a revolt in 1910. They chose [[João Cândido Felisberto]], an experienced sailor, as their leader. The mutiny was delayed several times by disagreements among the participants. In a major meeting on 13 November, some of the revolutionaries expressed a desire to revolt when the president would be inaugurated (15 November), but another leader, Francisco Dias Martins, talked them out of the idea, insisting that their demands would be overshadowed by a perceived rebellion against the political system as a whole. The immediate catalyst for their revolt came on 21 November 1910, when an Afro-Brazilian sailor, [[Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes]], was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 66–72; Morgan, &quot;Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 33, 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|There is some scholarly confusion over the exact date of Menezes' lashing. Morgan (2003) says that it occurred at dawn on 16 November and the span between whipping and revolt was due to the need for additional planning and organization.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, &quot;Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 33, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Love (2012), the account followed here, states that Menezes was whipped on the night of 21 November, with the revolt starting around 10 p.m. on the 22nd.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 28–29; 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Both, however, agree that the incident was the immediate cause of the uprising.}} A Brazilian government observer, former navy captain [[José Carlos de Carvalho]], stated that the sailor's back looked like &quot;a mullet sliced open for salting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Presentation to Federal Congress by Federal Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul, [[José Carlos de Carvalho]], 23 November 1910, in Morel, ''Revolta'', 80–84, in Morgan, &quot;Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt began aboard ''Minas Geraes'' at around 10&amp;nbsp;pm on 22 November; the ship's commander and several loyal crewmen were murdered in the process. Soon after, ''São Paulo'', the new cruiser ''Bahia'', the coast-defense ship {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Deodoro||2}}, the minelayer {{ship|Brazilian minelayer|República||2}}, the [[training ship]] {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Benjamin Constant||2}}, and the torpedo boats {{ship|Brazilian torpedo boat|Tamoio||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian torpedo boat|Timbira||2}} all revolted with relatively little violence. The first four ships represented the newest and strongest ships in the navy; ''Minas Geraes'', ''São Paulo'', and ''Bahia'' had been completed and commissioned only months before. ''Deodoro'' was twelve years old and had recently undergone a [[wikt:refit|refit]]. The crews of the smaller warships made up only two percent of the mutineers, and some moved to the largest ships after the revolt began.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 20, 28–31, 35–36; Morgan, &quot;Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key warships that remained in government hands included the old cruiser {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Almirante Barroso|1896|2}}, ''Bahia''{{'}}s sister {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, the eight new destroyers of the [[Pará class destroyer (1908)|''Pará'' class]]. Their crews were in a state of flux at the time: with nearly half of the navy's enlisted men in Rio at that time in open revolt, naval officers were suspicious of even those who remained loyal to the government. These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given that radio operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. Enlisted men on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's [[torpedo]]es. These could not be fired without [[Percussion cap|firing cap]]s, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 30–31, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Felisberto and his fellow sailors demanded an end to what they called the &quot;slavery&quot; being practiced by the navy, most notably the continued use of whipping despite its ban in every other Western nation. Though navy officers and the president were staunchly opposed to any sort of amnesty and made plans to attack the rebel-held ships, many legislators were supportive. Over the next three days, both houses of the Brazilian National Congress, led by the influential senator [[Rui Barbosa|Ruy Barbosa]], passed a general bill granting amnesty to all involved and ending the use of corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 33–47; Morgan, &quot;Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 38–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the revolt, the two Brazilian dreadnoughts were disarmed by the removal of their guns' [[breechblock]]s. The revolt and consequent state of the navy, which was essentially unable to operate for fear of another rebellion, caused many leading Brazilians, including the president, prominent politicians like Barbosa and the Baron of Rio Branco, and the editor of the most respected newspaper in Brazil, ''[[Jornal do Commercio]]'', to question the use of the new ships and support their sale to a foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 158–59.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|On the status of ''Jornal do Commercio'' within Brazil, see Love, ''Revolt'', 3.}} The British ambassador to Brazil, W.H.D.

{{quote|Let me, in conclusion, point out two profound lessons of the bitter situation in which we find ourselves. The first is that a military government is not one whit more able to save the country from the vicissitudes of war nor any braver or resourceful in meeting them than a civil government. The second is that the policy of great armaments has no place on the American continent. At least on our part and the part of the nations which surround us, the policy which we ought to follow with joy and hope is that of drawing closer international ties through the development of commercial relations, the peace and friendship of all the peoples who inhabit the countries of America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The experience of Brazil in this respect is decisive. All of the forces employed for twenty years in the perfecting of the means of our national defense have served, after all, to turn upon our own breasts these successive attempts at revolt. International war has not yet come to the doors of our republic. Civil war has come many times, armed by these very weapons which we have so vainly prepared for our defense against a foreign enemy. Let us do away with these ridiculous and perilous great armaments, securing international peace by means rather of just and equitable relations with our neighbors. On the American continent, at least, it is not necessary to maintain a 'peace armada'; that hideous cancer which is devouring continuously the vitals of the nations of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambuth1433&quot;&gt;Lambuth, &quot;Naval Comedy,&quot; 1433.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the end, the president and cabinet decided against selling the ships because they feared it would hurt them politically. This came despite a consensus agreeing that the ships should be disposed of, possibly to fund smaller warships capable of traversing Brazil's many rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant159&quot;&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive's apprehension was heightened by Barbosa's speech given before the revolt's end, as he also used the occasion to attack the government, or what he called the &quot;brutal militaristic regime.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambuth1433&quot;/&gt; Still, the Brazilians ordered Armstrong to cease working towards laying down their third dreadnought, which induced the Argentine government to not pick up their contractual option for a third dreadnought, and the United States' ambassador to Brazil cabled home to state that the Brazilian desire for naval preeminence in Latin America was quelled, though this proved to be short-lived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore45&quot; /&gt;

Although the ''Minas Geraes'' class remained in Brazilian hands, the mutiny had a clear detrimental effect on the navy's readiness: by 1912, an Armstrong agent stated that the ships were in terrible condition, with rust already forming on turrets and boilers. The agent believed it would cost the Brazilian Navy around £700,000 to address these issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant159&quot;/&gt; Haggard tersely commented, &quot;These ships are absolutely useless to Brazil,&quot; a sentiment echoed by ''Proceedings''.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Office, British National Archives, 371/1518, Haggard to Grey, 19 June 1913, Brazil, ''Annual Report'', 1912, in Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 160; Gill, &quot;Professional Notes,&quot; 1257.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the government's refusal to sell the two ''Minas Geraes''-class ships and subsequent support for acquiring ''Rio de Janeiro'', some historians credit the rebellion, combined with the Baron of Rio Branco's death in 1912, as major factors in the Brazilian government's decision (which was possibly made by January 1913, but certainly by September) to sell the ship to the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 160; Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempted sales ===
After ''Rio de Janeiro'' was purchased by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the [[Argentine National Congress]] in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of ''Rio de Janeiro''.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 46–47; Hislam, &quot;Century of Dreadnoughts,&quot; 146; &quot;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=PBH19140103.2.48 Turkey and Greece; Purpose of Dreadnoughts],&quot; ''Poverty Bay Herald'', 2 January 1914, 3; &quot;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1915-04-27/ed-1/seq-3/ Argentine Pride Outweighs $6,000,000 Profit Greece Offers for Moreno],&quot; ''New-York Tribune'', 27 April 1913, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' reported in late April that the Argentine government rejected a $17.5&amp;nbsp;million offer for ''Moreno'' alone, which would have netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships ($12&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1915-04-27/ed-1/seq-3/ Argentine Pride Outweighs $6,000,000 Profit Greece Offers for Moreno],&quot; ''New-York Tribune'', 27 April 1913, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships, which it eventually did.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, news outlets reported in late 1913 and early 1914 that Greece had reached an accord to purchase Chile's first battleship as a counterbalance to the Ottoman acquisition of ''Rio de Janeiro'',&lt;ref&gt;Gill, &quot;Professional Notes,&quot; 934; &quot;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1913-11-02/ed-1/seq-12/ Turkey Threatened with Another War],&quot; ''New-York Tribune'', 2 November 1913, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell one or both of the dreadnoughts, no deal was made.&lt;ref&gt;Kaldis, &quot;Background for Conflict,&quot; D1135; Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In each of the countries involved in the South American dreadnought arms race, movements arose that advocated the sale of the dreadnoughts to redirect the substantial amounts of money involved toward what they viewed as more worthy pursuits.&lt;ref name=Livermore45&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 45.&lt;/ref&gt; These costs were rightfully viewed as enormous. After the ''Minas Geraes'' class was ordered, a Brazilian newspaper equated the initial purchase cost for the original three ships as equaling 3,125 miles of [[Track (rail transport)|railroad tracks]] or 30,300 [[Homestead (buildings)|homesteads]]. Naval historian Robert Scheina put the price at [[Pound sterling|£]]6,110,100 without accounting for ammunition, which was £605,520, or necessary upgrades to docks, which was £832,000. Costs for maintenance and related issues, which in the first five years of ''Minas Geraes''{{'}}s and ''São Paulo''{{'}}s commissioned lives was about 60 percent of the initial cost, only added to the already staggering sum of money.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The two ''Rivadavia''s were purchased for nearly a fifth of the Argentine government's yearly income, a figure which did not include the later in-service costs.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, ''Big Battleship'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Robert K. Massie]] rounded the figure to a full quarter of each government's annual income.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, ''Castles'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the nationalistic sentiments that exacerbated the naval arms race gave way to slowing economies and negative public opinions which came to support investing inside the country instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore45&quot;/&gt; Commenting on this, the United States' [[United States Ambassador to Chile|Minister to Chile]], [[Henry Prather Fletcher]], wrote to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Jennings Bryan]]: &quot;Since the naval rivalry began in 1910, financial conditions, which were none too good then, have grown worse; and as time approaches for the final payment, feeling has been growing in these countries that perhaps they are much more in need of money than of battleships.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher to Bryan, No. 454, 16 February 1914, S.D.F., Chile, in Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The First World War effectively ended the dreadnought race, as all three countries suddenly found themselves unable to acquire additional warships.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 133.&lt;/ref&gt; After the conflict, the race never resumed, but many plans for post-war naval expansions and improvements were postulated by the Argentine, Brazilian, and Chilean governments.

The Brazilians modernized ''Minas Geraes'', ''São Paulo'', and the two cruisers acquired under the 1904 plan, {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Bahia||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, between 1918 and 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;English, Armed Forces, 110&quot;&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 110.&lt;/ref&gt; This was sorely needed, as all four ships were not ready to fight a modern war. Although the Brazilian government intended to send ''São Paulo'' overseas for service in the [[Grand Fleet]], both it and ''Minas Geraes'' had not been modernized since entering service, meaning they were without essential equipment like modern [[fire control]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 404; Robinson, &quot;Brazilian Navy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance on the two ships had also been neglected, which was most clearly illustrated when ''São Paulo'' was sent to New York for modernization: fourteen of its eighteen boilers broke down, and the ship required the assistance of the American battleship {{USS|Nebraska|BB-14|2}} and cruiser {{USS|Raleigh|C-8|2}} to continue the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 26, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The two cruisers were in &quot;deplorable&quot; condition, as they were able to steam at a top speed of only {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} thanks to a desperate need for new [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]s and boiler tubes. With repairs, though, both participated in the war as part of [[Brazilian cruiser Bahia#First World War|Brazil's main naval contribution to the conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, &quot;Brazilian Navy&quot;; &quot;Bahia (3º),&quot; ''Serviço de Documentação da Marinha&amp;nbsp;— Histórico de Navios''; &quot;Rio Grande do Sul I,&quot; ''Serviço de Documentação da Marinha&amp;nbsp;— Histórico de Navios.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian Navy also made plans to acquire additional ships in the 1920s and 30s, but both were sharply reduced from the original proposals. In 1924, they contemplated constructing a relatively modest number of warships, including a heavy cruiser, five destroyers, and five submarines. In the same year, the newly arrived American naval mission, led by Rear Admiral [[Carl Theodore Vogelgesang]], tendered a naval expansion plan of 151,000&amp;nbsp;tons, divided between battleships (70,000), cruisers (60,000), destroyers (15,000), and submarines (6,000). The United States' State Department, led by Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and fresh from negotiating the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], was not keen on seeing another dreadnought race, so Hughes quickly moved to thwart the efforts of the mission. Only one Italian-built submarine, {{ship|Brazilian submarine|Humaytá||2}}, was acquired during this time.&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 110; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 135–36; Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, the international community believed that the bulk of the Brazilian Navy was &quot;obsolete&quot; and were old enough to no longer be &quot;considered effective.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Brazil Navy Composed of 28 Obsolete Ships,&quot; ''New York Times'', 7 October 1930, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, ''Minas Geraes'' was modernized a second time at the [[Arsenal de Marinha do Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard]] from June 1931 to April 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 27; Topliss, &quot;Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 289.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Other sources give different dates for the modernization, such as 1931 to 1935,&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1934 to 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, ''Battleships'', 320–21; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 153.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Plans to give similar treatment to ''São Paulo'' were dropped due to the ship's poor material condition.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 29; Breyer, ''Battleships'', 321; Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 416.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, the Brazilian government looked into purchasing cruisers from the United States Navy but ran into the restrictions of the Washington and [[London Naval Treaty|London Naval Treaties]], which placed restrictions on the sale of used warships to foreign countries. The Brazilians eventually contracted for six destroyers from the United Kingdom.{{efn-ua|These were taken over after the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and became the [[G and H-class destroyer#Havant class 2|''Havant'' class]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the interim, a plan to lease six destroyers from the United States was abandoned after it was met with strong opposition from both international and American institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 136–37; Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Three {{sclass-|Marcilio Dias|destroyer}}s, based on the American {{sclass-|Mahan|destroyer|4}}, were laid down in Brazil with six minelayers, all of which were launched between 1939 and 1941. Though both programs required foreign assistance and were consequently delayed by the war, all nine ships were completed by 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, nearly all of the major warships of the Argentine Navy were obsolete; aside from ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'', the newest major warship had been constructed at the end of the nineteenth century. The Argentine government recognized this, and as part of holding on to their naval superiority in the region, they sent ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'' to the United States in 1924 and 1926 to be modernized. In addition, in 1926 the Argentine Congress allotted 75&amp;nbsp;million [[Argentine peso#Gold and silver pesos, 1881–1969|gold peso]]s for a naval building program.  This resulted in the acquisition of three cruisers (the Italian-built {{sclass-|Veinticinco de Mayo|cruiser|4}} and the British-built {{ship|ARA|La Argentina||2}}, twelve destroyers (the Spanish-built {{sclass-|Churruca|destroyer|4}} and the British-built {{sclass-|Mendoza|destroyer|5}}/{{sclass-|Buenos Aires|destroyer|5}} classes), and three submarines (the Italian-built {{sclass-|Santa Fe|submarine|4}}).&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 38–39; Scheina, &quot;Argentina,&quot; 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile began to seek additional ships to bolster its fleet in 1919, and the United Kingdom eagerly offered many of its surplus warships. This action worried nearby nations, who feared that a Chilean attempt to become the region's most powerful navy would destabilize the area and start another naval arms race.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 48; Graser Schornstheimer, &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04E6DF173AE532A25751C2A96E9C946195D6CF Chile as a Naval Power],&quot; ''New York Times'', 22 August 1920, X10.&lt;/ref&gt; Chile asked for ''Canada'' and ''Eagle'', the two battleships they ordered before the war, but the cost of converting the latter back to a battleship was too high.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, &quot;Great Britain,&quot; 70; Brown, &quot;HMS ''Eagle'',&quot; 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Planned replacements included the two remaining {{sclass-|Invincible|battlecruiser}}s, but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar within Chile itself over the value of such ships.&lt;ref&gt;Somervell, &quot;Naval Affairs,&quot; 393–94.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Chile only bought ''Canada'' and four destroyers in April 1920—all ships that had been ordered from British yards by the Chilean government before 1914 but were purchased by the Royal Navy after the British entered the First World War—for relatively low prices. ''Canada'', for instance, was sold for just £1,000,000, less than half of what had been required to construct the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 139; Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several years, the Chileans continued to acquire more ships from the British, like six destroyers (the {{sclass-|Serrano|destroyer|4}}) and three submarines (the {{sclass-|Capitan O'Brien|submarine (1928)|4}}).&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 148.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Almirante Latorre'' was modernized in the United Kingdom from 1929 to 1931 at the [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WhitleyBattleships&quot;&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; A recession and a [[Chilean naval mutiny of 1931|major naval revolt]] then led to the battleship's ''de facto'' inactivation in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 112–14; Sater, &quot;The Abortive Kronstadt,&quot; 240–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, the Chilean government inquired into the possibility of constructing an {{convert|8600|LT|t|adj=on}} cruiser in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, or Sweden, but this did not lead to an order. A second plan to acquire two small cruisers was dropped with the beginning of the Second World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;English149&quot;&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States attempted to purchase ''Almirante Latorre'', two destroyers, and a [[submarine tender]], probably because the Chilean Navy had a reputation for keeping its ships in top-quality condition, but the offer was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 149; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 164; Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, the three major South American navies found themselves unable to acquire major warships; they were only able to do so again after the conflict, when the United States and United Kingdom had many unnecessary or surplus warships. The war had proved the obsolete status of battleships, so the South American navies were seeking cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, yet they ran into political difficulties in acquiring anything larger than {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}}s and {{sclass2-|River|frigate}}s. They were only able to acquire them when the [[Red Scare]] began to strongly affect American and international politics. One of the deals reached under the [[Mutual Defense Assistance Act]] (1949) sold six American light cruisers to Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in January 1951.{{efn-ua|Most of the cruisers transferred were from the {{sclass-|Brooklyn|cruiser|4}}, but one of Brazil's cruisers ([[USS St. Louis (CL-49)|''Almirante Tamandaré'']]) was from the slightly improved {{sclass-|St. Louis|cruiser (1938)|4}}.}} While this bolstered the navies of important South American allies of the United States, which would be [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance|treaty-bound]] to assist the United States in any war, naval historian Robert Scheina argues that the American government also used the opportunity to significantly affect the traditional naval rivalry among the three countries. The warships sold unilaterally changed the naval outlook of all three nations, leading them to accept parity (as opposed to the Argentine pre-war stipulation that its fleet be equal to Brazil's and Chile's combined).&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 172–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The venerable dreadnoughts of South America soldiered on for a short time after the war. The US Navy's ''[[All Hands]]'' magazine reported in a series of 1948 articles that all save ''São Paulo'' and ''Almirante Latorre'' were still in active service; the former had been decommissioned and the latter undergoing repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, &quot;Brazil: Small, Modern Ships,&quot; 16; Austin, &quot;Largest South American Navy,&quot; 14; Austin, &quot;The Fleets of Chile and Peru,&quot; 25.&lt;/ref&gt; With the influx of the modern cruisers, frigates, and corvettes, the battleships were quickly sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]]. The Brazilian Navy was the first to dispose of its dreadnoughts, the oldest in the world by that time. ''São Paulo'' was sold for scrap in 1951 but sank in a storm north of the [[Azores]] while under tow.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;São Paulo I,&quot; ''Serviço de Documentação da Marinha&amp;nbsp;— Histórico de Navios''; &quot;E São Paulo,&quot; ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Minas Geraes'' followed two years later and was broken up in [[Genoa]] beginning in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;E Minas Geraes,&quot; ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Argentine dreadnoughts, ''Moreno'' was towed to Japan for scrapping in 1957, and ''Rivadavia'' was broken up in Italy beginning in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Almirante Latorre'', inactive and unrepaired after a 1951 explosion in its engine room, was decommissioned in October 1958 and followed ''Moreno'' to Japan in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 148; Whitley, ''Battleships'', 33; &quot;Acorazado Almirante Latorre,&quot; ''Unidades Navales''.&lt;/ref&gt;
