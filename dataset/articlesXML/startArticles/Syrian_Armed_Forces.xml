The '''Syrian Arab Armed Forces''' ({{lang-ar|القوات المسلحة العربية السورية}}) are the [[military forces]] of [[Syria]]. They consist of the [[Syrian Army|Syrian Arab Army]], [[Syrian Navy|Syrian Arab Navy]], [[Syrian Arab Air Force]], [[Syrian Air Defense Force|Syrian Arab Air Defense Force]], and several paramilitary forces, such as the [[National Defence Forces (Syria)|National Defence Force]]. According to the [[Constitution of Syria|Syrian constitution]], the [[President of Syria]] is the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Armed Forces.

The military is a conscripted force; males serve in the military upon reaching the age of 18, but there are many women in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/syriacountrystud00coll_0/syriacountrystud00coll_0_djvu.txt |author=Joshua Sinai|title=A Country Study, Syria|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|year=1987|page=260|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Syrian Civil War]], the enlisted members of the Syrian military have dropped by over half from a pre-civil war figure of 325,000 to 150,000 soldiers in the army in December 2014, due to casualties, [[desertions]] and [[draft dodging]],&lt;ref name=&quot;SCMP2014&quot;/&gt; reaching between 178,000 and 220,000 soldiers in the army,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]] 23 Sept 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to 80,000 to 100,000 irregular forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of the Syrian Civil War, the obligatory military service period was being decreased over time. In 2005, it was reduced from two and a half years to two years, in 2008 to 21 months and in 2011 to year and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria reduces compulsory military service by three months|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-03-20/content_2068776.html|newspaper=[[China Daily]]|date=20 March 2011|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503190742/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-03-20/content_2068776.html|archivedate=3 May 2011|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Syrian Civil War the Syrian government has reportedly engaged in arrest campaigns and enacted new regulations, with even citizens who have completed mandatory conscription being called up for reserve duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCMP2014&quot;/&gt;

==History==
The [[French Mandate]] volunteer force, which would later become the Syrian army, was established in 1920 with the threat of [[Arab nationalism|Syrian−Arab nationalism]] in mind. Although the unit's officers were originally all French, it was, in effect, the first indigenous modern Syrian army. In 1925, this force was expanded and designated as the [[Army of the Levant|Special Troops of the Levant]] (Troupes Spéciales du Levant). In 1941, during [[World War II]], the Army of the Levant participated in a futile resistance to the British and [[Free French]] invasion that ousted the [[Vichy French]] from Syria during the [[Syria–Lebanon Campaign]]. After the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] takeover, the army came under the control of the Free French and was designated the [[Army of the Levant|Levantine Forces]] (Troupes du Levant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.munseys.com/diskone/syriastud.pdf |author=Joshua Sinai|title=A Country Study, Syria|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|year=1987|page=190|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/syriacountrystud00coll_0/syriacountrystud00coll_0_djvu.txt|title=Full text of &quot;Syria : a country study&quot;|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; French Mandate authorities maintained a [[gendarmerie]] to police Syria's vast rural areas. This paramilitary force was used to combat criminals and political foes of the Mandate government. As with the Levantine Special Troops, French officers held the top posts, but as [[Evacuation Day (Syria)|Syrian independence]] approached, the ranks below major were gradually filled by Syrian officers who had graduated from the [[Homs Military Academy]], which had been established by the French during the 1930s. In 1938, the Troupes Spéciales numbered around 10,000 men and 306 officers (of whom 88 were French, mainly in the higher ranks). A majority of the Syrian troops were of rural background and minority ethnic origin, mainly [[Alawi]]s, [[Druze]]s, [[Kurd]]s, and [[Circassians]]. By the end of 1945, the army numbered about 5,000 and the gendarmerie some 3,500. In April 1946, the last French officers were forced to leave Syria due to sustained resistance offensives; the Levantine Forces then became the regular armed forces of the newly independent state and grew rapidly to about 12,000 by the time of the 1948 Arab−Israeli War, the first of four Arab−Israeli wars between 1948 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+sy0109) |author=Joshua Sina|title=Development of the Syrian Military |publisher=Library of Congress|year=1987|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post Second World War===
The Syrian Armed Forces fought in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] (against Israel), and were involved in a number of [[military coup]]s. Between 1948 and 1967, a series of military coups destroyed the stability of the government and any remaining professionalism within the armed forces. In March 1949, the chief of staff, General [[Husni al-Za'im]], installed himself as president. Two more military dictators followed by December 1949. General [[Adib Shishakli]] then held power until deposed in the [[1954 Syrian coup d'etat]]. Further coups followed, each attended by a purge of the officer corps to remove supporters of the losers from the force.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=457–458}}

In 1963, the Military Committee of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Syrian Regional Command]] of the [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] spent most of its time planning to take power through a conventional military coup. From the very beginning, the Military Committee knew it had to capture [[al-Kiswah]] and [[Qatana]], two military camps, seize control of the 70th Armoured Brigade at al-Kiswah, the Military Academy in the city of Homs and the Damascus radio station. While the conspirators of the Military Committee were all young, their aim was not out of reach; the sitting regime had been slowly disintegrating and the traditional elite had lost effective political power over the country.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=72}} A small group of military officers, including [[Hafez al-Assad]], soon seized control in the [[8th of March Revolution|March 1963 Syrian coup d'etat]]. Following the coup, General [[Amin al-Hafiz]] discharged many ranking Sunni officers, thereby, [[Stratfor]] says, 'providing openings for hundreds of [[Alawites]] to fill top-tier military positions during the 1963-1965 period on the grounds of being opposed to Arab unity. This measure tipped the balance in favor of Alawite officers who staged a coup in 1966 and for the first time placed Damascus in the hands of the Alawites.'&lt;ref name=Bhalla&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhalla|first=Reva|title=Making Sense of the Syrian Crisis|url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110504-making-sense-syrian-crisis?utm_source=GWeekly&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=110505&amp;utm_content=readmore&amp;elq=2ef73758a9434404bd465acd3490d5fe#ixzz1LTPFUuuw|publisher=[[Stratfor]]|accessdate=9 May 2011|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armed Forces were involved in the 1967 [[Six Day War]] (against Israel). Since 1967, most of the [[Golan Heights]] territory of southwestern Syria has been under Israeli occupation. They then fought in the late 1960s [[War of Attrition]] (against Israel), and the 1970 [[Black September in Jordan#Syrian intervention attempt|Black September]] invasion of Jordan. During the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973 the Syrian Army launched an invasion of Israel that was only narrowly repulsed. Since 1973 the [[cease-fire]] line has been respected by both sides, with very few incidents until the Syrian uprising of 2011 began.

Syria was invited into Lebanon by that country's president in 1976, to intervene on the side of the Lebanese government against a rebellion of [[PLO]] and Lebanese forces. The [[Arab Deterrent Force]] originally consisted of a Syrian core with participation by some other [[Arab League]] states. However the other states withdrew their forces in the late 1970s.

===Occupation of Lebanon===
Syrian forces, still technically known as the Arab Deterrent Force, lingered in Lebanon throughout the [[Lebanese civil war]] (1975–1990). Eventually the Syrians brought most of the nation under their control, as part of a power-struggle with Israel, which occupied areas of southern Lebanon in 1978. Following the end of the Lebanese civil war in 1990, the [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon]] continued until 2005, when they were forced out by widespread public protest and international pressure, following the murder of [[Rafiq al-Hariri]]. About 20,000 Syrian soldiers were deployed in Lebanon until 27 April 2005, when the last of Syria's troops left the country.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Syrian forces have been accused of involvement in that murder, as well as continued meddling in Lebanese affairs, and an international investigation into the Hariri killing and several subsequent bomb attacks has been launched by the UN.

===Other engagements===
Engagements since 1979 have included the [[Islamic uprising in Syria]] (1979–82), notably including the [[Hama Massacre]], the [[1982 Lebanon War]] (against Israel), and the dispatch of the [[9th Armoured Division (Syria)|9th Armoured Division]] to Saudi Arabia in 1990–91, ahead of the [[Gulf War]] against Iraq. The 9th Armoured Division served as the Arab Joint Forces Command North reserve and saw little action.{{sfn|Schwarzkopf|1993|p=467–469}} Syria's force numbered ~20,000 in strength (the 6th largest contingent) and their involvement was justified domestically as an effort to defend Saudi Arabia. Syria's initial involvement in [[Operation Desert Shield]] also rolled into the Allied [[Operation Desert Storm]] as Syrian forces did participate in helping dislodge and drive Iraqi forces out of [[Kuwait City]]. Total losses sustained were 2 dead and 1 wounded. There were indications the Syrian government had been prepared to double its force to 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;AFTER THE WAR; Syria Plans to Double Gulf Force (New York Times) http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/27/world/after-the-war-syria-plans-to-double-gulf-force.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Russia–Syria relations#Arms contracts}}
In recent years Syria has relied on Russian arms purchases to obtain modern weapons. Purchases have included anti-tank and air defence systems. In early September 2008, the Syrian government ordered [[MiG-29SMT]] fighters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|title='Russia confirms MiG jet sale to Syria'|url=http://www.jpost.com/home/article.aspx?id=153730|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pantsir-S1|Pantsir S1E air-defence systems]], [[9K720 Iskander|Iskander tactical missile systems]], [[Yakovlev Yak-130|Yak-130]] aircraft, and two [[Amur class|Amur-1650]] submarines from Russia. Russia's Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] asserted that the sale wouldn't upset the balance of power in the Middle East and were &quot;in line with ..international law.&quot;

Russia aims to turn the [[Russian naval base in Tartus]] into a permanent naval base. Israel and the United States oppose further arms sales to Syria due to fears that the weapons could fall under the control of Iran or [[Hezbollah]] fighters in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia defends arms sales to Syria|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/09/29/Russia_defends_arms_sales_to_Syria/UPI-28611222726785/|newspaper=[[United Press International]]|date=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite shrinking by nearly half since the beginning of the civil war in 2011, the Armed Forces have become much more flexible and capable, especially in anti-guerilla warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adapts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Oct-22/274895-syria-army-adapts-to-guerrilla-war.ashx#axzz3GNapFJpb|title=Syria army adapts to guerrilla war|publisher=The Daily Star|date=22 October 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''modus operandi'' switched from traditional Soviet-modeled conventional military forces into a force of smaller groups fighting in close-quarters guerrilla combat with an increasing role for junior officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adapts&quot;/&gt;

==Structure==
With its headquarters in [[Damascus]], the Syrian military consists of air, ground, and naval forces. Active personnel were estimated as 295,000 in 2011, with an additional 314,000 reserves. Paramilitary forces were estimated at 108,000 in 2011.{{sfn|IISS|2011|p=330}}

The majority of the Syrian military are [[Sunni]], but most of the military leadership are [[Alawites]]. Alawites make up 12 percent of the Syrian population but are estimated to make up 70 percent of the career soldiers in the [[Syrian Army]].&lt;ref name=Bhalla /&gt;&lt;ref name=State&gt;{{cite web|title=Background Note: Syria|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3580.htm|publisher=US State Department|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar imbalance is seen in the officer corps where some 80 percent of the officers are Alawites. The military’s most elite divisions, the [[Republican Guard (Syria)|Republican Guard]] and the [[4th Armoured Division (Syria)|4th Armoured Division]], which are commanded by [[Maher al-Assad|Bashar al-Assad's brother Maher]], are exclusively Alawite. Most of Syria’s 300,000 conscripts were, however, Sunni but that number is speculated to be changing now.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhalla&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria's military: what does Assad have?|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE72S19O20110406|agency=Reuters|accessdate=5 May 2011|date=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syrian Army===

In 1987, Joshua Sinai of the [[Library of Congress]] wrote that the [[Syrian Arab Army]] was the dominant military service, and as such controlled the senior-most posts in the armed forces, and had the most manpower, approximately 80 percent of the combined services. In 1987, Sinai wrote that the major development in force organisation was the establishment of an additional divisional framework based on the [[special forces]] and the organisation of ground formations into two corps.&lt;ref name=LOCSyriaArmy&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinai |first=Joshua |editor-first=Thomas|editor-last=Collelo|title=A Country Study: Syria |publisher=Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]] |date=April 1987|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+sy0120%29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] estimated army regulars at 220,000, with an additional 280,000 reserves. That figure was unchanged in the 2011 edition of the ''Military Balance'',{{sfn|IISS|2011|p=330}} but in the 2013 edition, in the midst of the war, the IISS estimated that army strength was 110,000.

The army's active manpower served in three, all-arms army corps, eight armoured divisions (with one independent armoured brigade), three mechanised divisions, one armoured-special forces division, and ten, independent airborne-special forces brigades.{{sfn|IISS|2010|p=272–273}} The army had eleven divisional formations reported in 2011, with a fall in the number of armoured divisions reported from the 2010 edition, from eight to seven.{{sfn|IISS|2011|p=330}} The independent armoured brigade had been replaced by an independent tank regiment. However, in addition to the 14th Special Forces Division, the [[15th Division (Syria)|15th Special Forces Division]] has been identified by [[Human Rights Watch]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=By All Means Necessary!|url=http://www.hrw.org/node/103558/section/12|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|page=12|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Defense companies]] were merged into the Syrian Army as the [[4th Armoured Division (Syria)|4th Armoured Division]] and the [[Republican Guard (Syria)|Republican Guard]]. The 4th Armoured Division became one of the Assad government's most trusted security forces.

===Syrian Navy===
In 1950, the [[Syrian Navy]] was established following the procurement of a few naval craft from France. The initial personnel consisted of soldiers who had been sent to French academies of naval training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian Arab Navy|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/syria/navy.htm|work=Global Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the navy consisted of approximately 4,000 regular and 2,500 reserve officers and men. The navy is under the army's Latakia regional command. The fleet was based in the ports of Latakia, Baniyas, Minat al Bayda, and Tartus. Among the 41 vessel fleet were 2 frigates, 22 missile attack craft (including 10 advanced [[OSA-II|Osa II]] missile boats), 2 submarine chasers, 4 mine warfare vessels, 8 gunboats, 6 patrol craft, 4 missile corvettes (on order), 3 landing craft (on order), 1 torpedo recovery vessel and, as part of its coastal defence system, Sepal shore-based, anti-ship missiles with a range of 300 kilometres.

===Syrian Air Force===
The [[Syrian Arab Air Force]] is the [[Air force|aviation]] branch of the Syrian Armed Forces. It was established in 1948, and saw combat in 1948, 1967, 1973 and in 1982 against Israel. It has seen combat against militant groups on Syrian soil from 2011-2012, during the [[Syrian civil war]]. Presently, there are at least 15 [[List of Syrian Air Force bases|Syrian air force bases]] throughout the country.

===Syrian Air Defence Force===
{{Main article|Syrian Air Defense Force}}
In 1987, according to the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]], the Air Defence Command, within the Army Command, but also composed of Air Force personnel, numbered approximately 60,000.&lt;ref name=LOCSyriaArmy /&gt; In 1987, units included twenty air defence brigades (with approximately ninety-five SAM batteries) and two air defence regiments. The Air Defence Command had command access to interceptor aircraft and radar facilities. Air defences included SA-5 long-range SAM batteries around Damascus and Aleppo, with additional SA-6 and SA-8 mobile SAM units deployed along Syria's side of the Lebanese border and in eastern Lebanon.

At some later point in time, the Air Defence Command was upgraded into a separate, Syrian Air Defense Force.

===Paramilitary forces===
''See: [[List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War#Syrian government and allies]] for more information on current paramilitaries due to the ongoing [[Syrian civil war]].''
*[[As-Sa'iqa]] - a commando force than merged into the [[National Defence Forces (Syria)|National Defence Forces]]
*[[Defense Companies (Syria)|Defense Companies]] - since merged into the Syrian Arab Army as the 4th Armoured division and the Republican Guard as well as the 14th Airborne Division comprising 5 Special Forces regiments.
*[[Palestine Liberation Army]] - a Palestinian Auxiliary, ostensibly returned to Palestine Authority control.
*[[Republican Guard (Syria)|Republican Guard]] - since merged into the army.
*[[Struggle Companies (Syria)|Struggle Companies]] - status unknown.
*[[National Defence Forces (Syria)|National Defence Forces]] - a part-time volunteer reserve component of the military.

===Role of women in the Armed forces===

As the [[Syrian Civil War]] progressed and casualties mounted, more and more positions were opened to women. The National Defense Force allows female volunteers into its ranks, mainly in securing checkpoints. The Republican Guard also formed a female section, an all female tank battalion of 800 strong, nicknamed 'Lionesses of Defense', fighting within the limits of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3011838/Syria-s-female-tank-drivers-Battalion-800-women-commandos-fierce-clashes-rebels-line-Damascus.html|title=Battalion of Syrian women commandos in clashes with rebels in Damascus&amp;nbsp; - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] &amp;mdash; long the principal source of training, material, and credit for the Syrian forces &amp;mdash; may have slowed Syria's ability to acquire modern military equipment. It has an arsenal of surface-to-surface missiles. In the early 1990s, [[Scud C|Scud-C]] missiles with a 500-kilometer range were procured from [[North Korea]], and [[Scud D|Scud-D]], with a range of up to 700 kilometers, is allegedly being developed by Syria with the help of North Korea and Iran, according to Eyal Zisser.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v4/sub/MarketingPage?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20040928%2FCOSYRIA28%2FTPComment%2FTopStories&amp;ord=2674524&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;redirect_reason=2&amp;denial_reasons=none&amp;force_login=false &quot;Syria's embrace of WMD&quot;] by Eyal Zisser, ''Globe and Mail'', 28 September 2004 (link leads only to abstract; purchase necessary for full article) {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syria received significant financial aid from Persian Gulf Arab states as a result of its participation in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], with a sizable portion of these funds earmarked for [[military spending]]. In 2005, Russia forgave Syria of three-fourths, or about $9.8 billion, of its $13.4 billion [[Soviet Union|Soviet-era]] debt. Russia wrote off the debt in order to renew arms sales with Syria.&lt;ref name=GlobalSecurity&gt;{{cite book|last=Weitz|first=Richard|title=Global security watch--Russia: A reference handbook|year=2010|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-0-313-35434-2|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcdZ9s2IAwMC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=russian+navy+syria+tartous#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, [[Russia–Syria relations|arms contracts with Russia]], Syria's main arms supplier, were worth at least $4 billion.&lt;ref name=SIPRI&gt;{{cite web|title=SIPRI Arms Transfers Database|url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/values.php|publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Amos&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Howard|title=News Analysis: Russia Damages Image in Arab Spring|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/news-analysis-russia-damages-image-in-arab-spring/442712.html|accessdate=8 September 2011|newspaper=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAST&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian defence industry and arms trade:  facts and figures|url=http://www.cast.ru/files/2011/all-stats_eng_2011_05_12.pdf|publisher=Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies. pp 15|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyer|first=Henry|title=Assad Ouster Bid May Unleash ‘Chaos in Mideast,’ Russia Says|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-07/assad-ouster-bid-may-unleash-chaos-in-mideast-russia-says.html|accessdate=8 September 2011|newspaper=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria has conducted research and produced [[Syria and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria not next on list, says Britain|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/14/1050172532711.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=April 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniforms (1987)===
In 1987, according to a [[Library of Congress Country Study]] on Syria, service uniforms for Syrian military officers generally followed the [[British Army]] style, although army combat clothing followed the older British model. Each uniform had two coats: a long one for dress and a short jacket for informal wear. Army officer uniforms were khaki in summer, olive in winter. Certain Army and Air Defense personnel (i.e., commandos and paratroops) may have worn camouflage uniforms. Air force officers had two uniforms for each season: a khaki and a light gray for summer and a dark blue and a light gray in winter. Naval officers wore white in summer and navy blue in winter while lower ranks wear the traditional bell bottoms and white blouse. The uniform for naval chief petty officers was a buttoned jacket, similar to that worn by American chief petty officers. Officers had a variety of headgear, including a service cap, garrison cap, and beret (linen in summer and wool in winter). The color of the beret varied by season and according to the officer's unit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+sy0126%29|author=Joshua Sina |title=Uniforms and Rank Insignia|publisher=Library of Congress|year=1987|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syrian Commando and Paratroop uniforms consist of [[lizard pattern|lizard]] or [[Woodland pattern|woodland-pattern]]ed camouflage fatigues along with combat boots, helmets and bulletproof vests. Headgear consisted of a red or orange beret.

The Syrian military provides [[NBC suit|NBC uniforms]] to soldiers in order to remain effective in an environment effected by biological or chemical agents. This uniform consisted of a Russian-made Model ShMS-41 mask similar to those made in the Desert Storm conflict.&lt;ref name=Rottman1993&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Rottman|title=Armies of the Gulf War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nfT5KsdYk4cC&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=20 March 2013|date=27 May 1993|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-85532-277-6|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous models of the ShMS used a hose, while the improved &quot;ShmS-41&quot; used a canister-style [[Respirator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|zQVYf1y_FDE|Soviet SCHMS Respirator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|FTvyAMGenL4|My Russian SCHMS gas mask with hose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rank Insignia (1987)===
{{Main article|Military ranks of Syria}}
In 1987, according to a Library of Congress Country Study on Syria, the rank insignia of Syrian commissioned officers were identical for both the army and air force. These were gold on a bright green shoulder board for the army and gold on a bright blue board for the air force. Officer ranks were standard, although the highest is the equivalent of lieutenant general, a rank held in 1986 only by the commander in chief and the minister of defence. Navy officer rank insignia were gold stripes worn on the lower sleeve. The highest-ranking officer in Syria's navy is the equivalent of lieutenant general. Army and air force rank for warrant officers were indicated by gold stars on an olive green shield worn on the upper left arm. Lower noncommissioned ranks were indicated by upright and inverted chevrons worn on the upper left arm.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

===Awards and decorations===
Although some twenty-five orders and medals were authorized, generally only senior officers and warrant officers wear medal ribbons. The following were some important Syrian awards: Order of Umayyads, Medal of Military Honor, the War Medal, Medal for Courage, Yarmuk Medal, Wounded in Action Medal, and Medal of [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|8 March 1963]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;
