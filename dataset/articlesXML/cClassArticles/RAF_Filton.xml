'''Royal Air Force Filton''' or more simply '''RAF Filton''' is a former [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Royal Air Force station|station]] located {{Convert|5.0|mi}} north of the city centre of [[Bristol]], England.

Throughout its existence, RAF Filton shared the airfield with the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] (later British Aircraft Corporation) whose works, now owned by BAE/Airbus, are situated on the south side of the main runway.

==History==
===First World War===
The first squadron to form at the airfield during the [[First World War]] was [[No. 33 Squadron RAF|No. 33 Squadron RFC]] which formed during January 1916 and was composed of elements of [[No. 20 Squadron RAF|No. 20 Squadron RFC]] which flew the [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]].{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=36}} The next squadron was [[No. 42 Squadron RAF|42 Squadron]] which moved to Filton during April 1916 from crews of [[No. 19 Squadron RAF|19 Squadron]] and again flew the B.E.2.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=39}}

Then [[No. 66 Squadron RAF|No. 66 (Fighter) Squadron]] was formed in June 1916 with [[Sopwith Pup]] biplanes before the squadron moved on to France in March 1917.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=45}} The squadron was joined by [[No. 62 Squadron RAF|62 Squadron]] in August 1916 when the squadron was formed from elements of No. 7 Training Squadron which were equipped with the [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]] from May 1917.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=44}}

===Between the wars===
[[No. 101 Squadron RAF]] was disbanded at Filton following its return from France in March 1919 where it had flown the [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2]] as a night bomber squadron.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=54}} In June 1929 [[No. 501 Squadron RAF|No. 501 (Special Reserve) Squadron RAF]] was formed at Filton as a day bomber squadron flying [[Airco DH.9A]] biplanes.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=94}} Initially named 'City of Bristol' it was renamed 'County of Gloucester' Squadron in May 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Sqn500-520.htm|title=No 501  (City of Bristol) Squadron|publisher=Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became part of the Auxiliary Air Force in 1936. The Squadron flew [[Hawker Hart]]s and then the [[Hawker Hind]] light bomber from 1938.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=94}}

===Second World War===

During the Second World War was home to the Filton Sector Operations Room which was part of [[No. 10 Group RAF]] of [[RAF Fighter Command]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/40-08_raf-fighter-command.htm|title=RAF Fighter Command - Order of Battle - No. 10 Group|publisher=World War II Armed Forces â€” Orders of Battle and Organizations|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first unit to use the airfield was [[No. 935 (County of Glamorgan) Barrage Balloon Unit]] (Auxiliary Air Force) was at Filton from January 1939 with 2 Flights of 8 [[barrage balloon]]s, and responsible for the defence of the [[HMNB Devonport|Naval Yard]] at [[Plymouth]] as well as the airfield at Filton.  The unit's allocation was increased to 24 Balloons during August 1940 as RAF Filton did not have a defensive fighter squadron attached to defend the airfield. [[No. 11 Balloon Centre]] at [[RAF Pucklechurch]], north of Bristol, also came under the command of the RAF Filton station commander.

Squadrons stationed at RAF Filton from the beginning of the Second World War included [[No. 501 Squadron RAF|501 (County of Gloucester) Sqdn (Auxiliary Air Force)]], now flying [[Hawker Hurricane]] Ic fighters, until 10 May 1940 when the Squadron moved to France;{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=94}} and [[No. 263 Squadron RAF|263 Squadron]] (reformed on 2 October 1939 at Filton) taking over some of the [[Gloster Gladiator]] I biplane fighters{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=80}} previously with [[No. 605 Squadron RAF]] and still wearing that squadron's code letter (HE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unit History: RN Air Station Filton|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/units/3351/rn-air-station-filton/|publisher=Forces War Records|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Squadron went on to [[Norway]] in April 1940 operating from a frozen lake.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=80}}

Between May and June 1940, [[No. 236 Squadron RAF|No. 236 Squadron]] was based at Filton with [[Bristol Blenheim]] twin-engined fighters,{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=75}} flying defensive sweeps over the [[English Channel|Channel]].

In February 1941 [[No. 118 Squadron RAF]] was reformed at Filton flying [[Supermarine Spitfire]] I's until April 1941.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=57}}

Also in February 1941, [[Bristol University Air Squadron]] (UAS) was formed at Filton as part of 54 Group (along with Birmingham UAS). Initially flying the [[de Havilland Moth]] and later [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]] and [[North American T-6 Texan|North American Harvard]] trainers. It continued at Filton until it was disbanded in 1946.

[[No. 528 Squadron RAF]] was formed at Filton in June 1943, flying the Bristol Blenheim and [[de Havilland Hornet Moth]]{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=96}} in the radar calibration role.{{sfn|Ashworth5|1990|p=89}}

During the Second World War the Station [[Warrant Officer]] at Filton was Alec (Tubby) Kerr. Described in the [[Bristol Evening World]] in 1957 as one of the best-known Station Warrant Officers the RAF has ever known. SWO Kerr was awarded the MBE on 13 June 1946.

====The Filton 'Blitz'====
The airfield was attacked on 25 September 1940 just before mid-day by 58 [[Heinkel 111]] bombers with [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] fighter escort. The [[Luftwaffe]] raid was primarily aimed at the Bristol Aeroplane Company's works on the south side of the airfield. One of the air raid shelters on the airfield received a direct hit, five others seriously damaged and during the raid over 200 people were killed. Luftwaffe reconnaissance planes had determined that there were no fighter aircraft stationed at Filton prior to the attack but [[No. 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron RAF]] (Auxiliary Air Force) was moved in from 26 September 1940, flying [[Hawker Hurricane]] Mk1 fighters, as a result of this raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationarchive.org.uk/stories/pages.php?enum=GE126&amp;pnum=4&amp;maxp=8|title=Air Raid at Filton 25th September 1940|publisher=Aviation Archive: Aviation Heritage|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post war years===

[[File:VulcanB2atFilton1960s.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An Avro Vulcan B1A V bomber parked on one of the four rapid dispersal points at Filton during a public air display in the 1960s]]
After the war years Filton again became home to [[No. 501 Squadron RAF]], which was reformed in May 1946 as a [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] day-fighter squadron equipped with Spitfire XVI (LF)s. These were followed in 1948 by [[de Havilland Vampire]] F1s, and the FB5 from Spring 1951. 501 Squadron continued at Filton until it was disbanded in March 1957, when the remaining Royal Auxiliary Air Force flying units were stood down.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=95}}

Filton was also once again home to the Bristol University Air Squadron as part of 62 Group.{{sfn|Ashworth5|1990|p=89}} Initially flying de Havilland Tiger Moth T2s, these were replaced with [[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk]] T10 trainers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BUAS History|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/universityairsquadrons/findasquadron/buashistory.cfm|publisher=Royal Air Force|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unit History: RN Air Station Filton|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/units/3351/rn-air-station-filton/|publisher=Forces War Records|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also No. 3 Air Experience Flight RAFVR which was formed on 8 September 1958, also with de Havilland Chipmunk trainers.{{sfn|Ashworth5|1990|p=89}}

Operating out of Filton from 1948 was [[No. 12 Reserve Flying School]] (RFS) equipped with six de Havilland Tiger Moths for RAF Reserve Pilot training and (from 1949) initially two (later three) [[Avro Anson]]s for Navigator training. This school was operated under special contract to the Air Ministry by the Bristol Aeroplane Company as part of the Volunteer Reserve Pilot training scheme. This continued until March 1953 when No. 12 RFS closed.{{sfn|Ashworth5|1990|p=89}}

In the 1950s and early '60s, Filton was designated as a [[V bomber]] dispersal base. During the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (October 1962) [[Avro Vulcan]] V bombers were at Filton and kept at 'immediate readiness' status with engines idling.

==Current use==
The airfield is now closed and the only aircraft operating is NPAS (Western Counties Air Operations Unit) Police helicopter &amp; an Air Ambulance
