'''Louis Henry of Nassau-Dillenburg''' (9 May 1594 in [[Saarbrücken]] &amp;ndash; 12 July 1662 in [[Dillenburg]]), was Count, and from 1654 [[Prince]] of [[Nassau-Dillenburg]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], he was a senior officer. He climbed to the rank of [[Major General]]. Before 1635, he served on the [[Protestant]] side; after 1635, he served in the imperial army.

== Background ==
He was the son of the Count [[George, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg|George]] of Nassau-Beilstein and later Nassau-Dillenburg. His mother was Anna Amalie Countess of [[Nassau-Saarbrücken]]. In 1616, he married in his first marriage Countess Catherine of [[Sayn-Wittgenstein]] (1588–1651). In 1653 he married his second wife Wild- and [[Rhinegrave|Rhinegravine]] Elizabeth of Salm-Dhaun (1593–1656). In 1656, he married his third wife, Sofie Magdalene of Nassau-Hadamar (1622–1658). He had five sons and eight daughters from his first marriage, two of the sons and four of the daughters died early. From his second marriage, he had another three sons, two of whom died early.

== Early years ==
Louis Henry was first educated at the court in Dillenburg and later at [[Herborn Academy]]. He then made a [[Grand Tour]] to [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]]. He received his military training under Prince [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Orange-Nassau]]. As early as 1614, he participated in the relief of [[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]], which was besieged by the Spanish.

Louis Henry and his brother [[Albert, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg|Albert]] inherited Nassau-Dillenburg in 1623. They ruled jointly, until Albert died in 1626 and Louis Henry became the sole ruler.

== Councillor Hoen and domestic policies ==
The Emperor had [[outlaw]]ed the Counts of Nassau-Dillenburg and Nassau-Hadamar for allegedly supporting Elector Palatine [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]]. The Emperor had assigned their possessions to [[John VIII, Count of Nassau-Siegen|John VIII]] of Nassau-Siegen. This ruling was never carried out, thanks to the efforts of [[John Louis of Nassau-Hadamar|John Louis]] of Nassau-Hadamar. Even so, the military occupation of Nassau-Dillenburg from 1622 onwards, put a high strain on his land. Louis Henry saw reducing this damage as his main task. He only played a relatively small rôle himself. Policies were mainly drawn up and carried out by his councillor, the publicist and professor [[Philipp Heinrich Hoen]] (''Hoenosius''). Hoen also administered the county during Henry Louis long periods of absence. He also represented the interests of the House of Nassau and the [[Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts]] in the negotiations the led to the [[Peace of Westphalia]].

== In Protestant service ==
Louis Henry initially stood on the side of the [[Protestant Union]]. He joined the army of King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] as a colonel. He led an infantry regiment and later a cavalry regiment. His troops distinguished themselves in various battles, and Louis Henry himself showed personal bravery. He distringuished himself in particular during the storming of fortified cities and fortresses, such as the capture of [[Braunfels]] in 1635.

== In the imperial service ==
Later that year, when the war seemed to turn against the Swedes, Louis Henry changed sides and joined the imperial side. He served the emperor as a senior officer and united his forces with those of Landgrave [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|George II]] of Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1637, he held the rank of [[Major general]] and marched into Saxony. He then enjoyed the imperial favour at the court in [[Prague]]. In 1654, he was rewarded for his services by being raised to [[Imperial Prince]].

== Domestic policies after 1649 ==
After Hoen died in 1649, Louis Henry tried to enforce an [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] policy in Dillenburg. He was only partially successful. He also attempted to support [[Herborn Academy]], which had been badly affected by the war, but eventually lost interest.

Louis Henry died in 1662. Since his eldest son, [[George Louis, Prince of Nassau-Dillenburg|George Louis]] had already died in 1656, Dillenburg was inherited by his grandson [[Henry, Prince of Nassau-Dillenburg|Henry]].

== Family ==
Louis Henry was married three times. His first wife was Catherine of Sayn-Wittgenstein (1588–1651), the daughter of [[Louis I, Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein]]. The couple had the following children:
* Anne (1616–1649), married:
*# in 1638 with Count Philip of Wied (d. 1638)

* Philip (1630–1657)
* Zwillige (1631)
* Maria Eleonora (1632–1633)

After Catherine's death, he married Wild- and Rhinegravine Elizabeth of Salm-Dhaun (1593–1656), the daughter of Wild- and [[Rhinegrave]] Adolph Henry of Dhaun-Neufviller. However, she died soon after the wedding.

In 1656, he married his third wife. She was Sophie of Nassau-Hadamar (1622–1658), the daughter of [[John Louis of Nassau-Hadamar|John Louis]] of Nassau-Hadamar. They had three children:
* Augustus (1657–1680)
* Charles (1658–1659)
* Louis (1658-1658)
