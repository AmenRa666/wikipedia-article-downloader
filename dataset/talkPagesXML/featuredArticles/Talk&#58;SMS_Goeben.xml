== Comments ==
'''TCG''' stands for &quot;Turkiye Cumhuriyeti Gemisi&quot; which translates as &quot;Republic of Turkey's Ship&quot;. There was no Republic of Turkey in 1914 and the ship being renamed &quot;TCG Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; at that date is not possible. As far as I know it was named just '''Yavuz''' after the Ottoman Emperor [[Selim I]] who had earned the nickname Yavuz (cruel) because of his massacres of [[Turkoman]]s in early 16th century.

:Yavuz can be translated as &quot;resolute&quot; and has a positive meaning in Turkish. it is definitely wrong to translate &quot;yavuz&quot; as &quot;cruel&quot;.[[User:84.71.92.85|84.71.92.85]] 22:40, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
::Into Russian ''yavuz'' translates as &quot;''грозный''&quot; (Grozny) , that usually translates as ''&quot;terrible&quot;'' or ''awesome'' into English (See [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan-the-Terrible]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The epithet &quot;Grozny&quot; is associated with might, power and strictness, rather than poor performance, horror or cruelty. Some authors more accurately translate it into modern English as Ivan the Awesome 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How about this option? [[User:Сергей Олегович|Сергей Олегович]] ([[User talk:Сергей Олегович|talk]]) 15:50, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

== Unencyclopedic ==
The 1915 section reads like a biased action script. &quot;Eagerly the Russians chased after them, the ponderous battleships at their maximum of 25 knots,&quot; &quot;... but she spurted out of range ...,&quot; &quot;...  stern searchlights stabbed back down her wake, illuminating the sinister shapes of five destroyers ...,&quot; &quot;The big guns of the battleships belched flame, and columns of water from exploding shells rose all around their lone opponent.&quot; [[Special:Contributions/24.21.10.30|24.21.10.30]] ([[User talk:24.21.10.30|talk]]) 20:55, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

== Bias against Turkey ==
This article is obviously biased against the Ottoman Empire.  Terms like &quot;unfortunately&quot; and &quot;the tragedy of Gallipoli&quot; are especially bad.  Though Gallipoli was surely a tragedy in terms of lives lost on both sides, it is a victory that Turkish people take pride in.  Also, the encounter in the Aegean Sea was only &quot;unfortunate&quot; for the British. 
([[User:Brandonwilson|Brandonwilson]] ([[User talk:Brandonwilson|talk]]) 05:43, 20 August 2008 (UTC))
:Another point. This ship fought under the flag of the Ottoman Empire for most of World War I, and had a very long postwar career as the flagship of the Turkish Navy. It was the Yavuz Sultan Selim for much longer than it was the Goeben, so why isn't it listed under its Turkish name? [[User:Jsc1973|Jsc1973]] ([[User talk:Jsc1973|talk]]) 07:53, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

::Probably because German things are more familiar to English speakers than Turkish things. It's probably a healthy dose of systemic bias, but all of the books I've got on WWI naval warfare refer to the ship as ''Goeben'', even after transferal of the ship to the Ottoman navy. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 12:53, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

== When was the ship decommissioned? ==
The introduction reads ''until her decommissioning in '''1960''''', ship box names '''1973''' as time of decommissioning, and in the section &quot;Post War Service&quot;, it's written ''In '''1954''' Yavuz was decommissioned''. [[Special:Contributions/89.201.105.23|89.201.105.23]] ([[User talk:89.201.105.23|talk]]) 12:54, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

:My ''Conway's 1906-1921'' states that the ship was laid up in 1948 (i.e., pulled from active service) and actually decommissioned in 1960. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 13:09, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

== Names ==
It was not proper to use the previous German name for a ship that became the flagship of the Ottoman Navy.  I changed them, hope no one minds.  Same with Midilli cruiser, name of the Aegean island, that was under Ottoman rule at the time, needs disambigouation, someone more capable than me should do this please. Also the the proper name of the cruiser is Hamidiye, as it is spelled here.  The other one is Mecidiye.  I corrected them also.  Hamidiye is in desperate need of disambiguation, as it never appears as the cruiser it is.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/173.77.168.53|173.77.168.53]] ([[User talk:173.77.168.53|talk]]) 06:09, 21 November 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Battle of Imbros ==
Couple of corrections/expansions needed here. Raglan and M28 were at anchor off Imbros Island (there's a brief article on the Battle of Imbros) when sunk. Lord Nelson was at Saloniki, but Agamemnon was at Mudros. &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buxton|first=Ian|title=Big Gun Monitors: Design, Construction and Operations 1914–1945|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|date=2008|edition=2nd, revised and expanded|pages=36–37|isbn=978-1-59114-045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; M17 attempted to bombard her while Yavuz was grounded, but only fired ten rounds before giving up.Buxton, p. 38  --[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 20:01, 16 January 2010 (UTC)

:I added the details pertaining to the monitors, but am a little confused about ''Lord Nelson''. I'm wondering if Halpern was a bit confused when he wrote the line {{xt|They then proceeded toward Mudros, where the ''Lord Nelson'' was raising steam to meet them.}} He wrote a few lines earlier {{xt|The British commander...foolishly divided his forces by taking the ''Lord Nelson'' with him to Salonika at a time when the French battleship was in dock.}} I wonder if he did mean that ''Agamemnon'' was at Mudros. Is there a third source that might give us more of a final say? [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 03:05, 17 January 2010 (UTC)
::Why, yes, the HMS Agamemnon article quotes Burt's British Battleships 1889–1904 with Agamemnon at Mudros and Lord Nelson at Saloniki.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 03:19, 17 January 2010 (UTC)
:::Alrighty, I'll make the switch. Definitely looks like a typo in Halpern's book. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 03:22, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

== first aerial attack ==
What exact aerial attack was Hough referring to? The 1918 attack? I'm pretty sure that he's wrong as the Germans attempted to bomb Slava a number of times in 1915–16.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 03:48, 29 January 2010 (UTC)

:Yeah, it was the attack after she was beached in 1918. He says {{xt|the first capital ship to be subjected to air attack}}. Maybe he meant the first ship to be successfully bombed from the air (regardless of the result, which in this case was nil). Did the Germans ever actually hit ''Slava''? That could be the distinction.  [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 13:07, 30 January 2010 (UTC)

== Post-WWI service ==
Nick, nice work. The '''Ottoman Steam Navy''' might have some post-WWI stuff as well, but maybe not. One clarification that may or may not be worthwhile. ''Parizkaya Kommuna'' (sp) was ordered to the Black Sea in 1929, but arrived in early 1930.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 19:15, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

I cannot think the sentence you tried to defend is so important and encyclopedic. But the sentence '''[[File:Yavuz (Goeben) battlecruiser Istambul April 1946 - cropped.jpg|thumb|''Yavuz'' in Istanbul during the visit of the American battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} in 1946.''' is more important and we can find sources for this easily ?

::I read your message. The sample in [[WP:ALTTEXT]] ''alt=Painting of Napoleon Bonaparte |[[The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries]] by [[Jacques-Louis David]]'' is reasonable and meaningful sentence but unfortunately ''A large warship sits motionless in harbor against the backdrop of a large city.'' is ambiguous and meaningless. There is no reason to put this sentence and to remove historical facts. [[User:Takabeg|Takabeg]] ([[User talk:Takabeg|talk]]) 12:42, 27 June 2011 (UTC)

== Key question missing? ==
Why did Yavuz bombard Sevastopol on 29 October in her first operation against Imperial Russia, though the Ottoman Empire was not yet at war with the Entente? As it brought Turkey into WW1 I rather think the question should be asked. --[[User:John|John]] ([[User talk:John|talk]]) 00:27, 18 July 2012 (UTC)
:IIRC, Souchon wanted to force the Turks' hand in regards to the Russians. But I'll let Parsec answer that one more definitively.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 00:34, 18 July 2012 (UTC)
::Yeah, that was the reason. He wanted to force a conflict with Russia so the pro-German faction in Turkey would come out on top. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 11:34, 18 July 2012 (UTC)

== Yavuz or Goeben ==

The title is problematic. The ship made name in the WW1 by bombarding the Russian ports and later defending Bosphorus against possible Russian attacks when it was already renamed Yavuz. I don't know why it is still named Goeben ? [[User:Nedim Ardoğa|Nedim Ardoğa]] ([[User talk:Nedim Ardoğa|talk]]) 06:53, 28 July 2014 (UTC)
:I thought I explained this to you once before. To the English-speaking world the ship was still known as ''Goeben'' then - and don't forget that she first became famous during the chase to Constantinople before her fictional sale. [[User:BB-PB|Parsecboy]] ([[User_talk:BB-PB|talk]]) 09:58, 28 July 2014 (UTC)
::Yes, this issue had already been discussed in my page. But there was no satisfactory explanation. The name of the ship was Yavuz for 36 years and the most important event in her history was during this period. The rationale based on her name in English speaking world is not conclusive, because there were hundreds of warships in WW1, names of most have been forgotten. If this ship was famous, that is because of the events after she was renamed. [[User:Nedim Ardoğa|Nedim Ardoğa]] ([[User talk:Nedim Ardoğa|talk]]) 11:24, 28 July 2014 (UTC)
:::If my explanation was not satisfactory, that's your problem. This ship is far more well known ''in English'' under her German name, not her Ottoman/Turkish name, and since this is the English Wikipedia, we [[WP:UE|follow English usage]]. If you don't like it, you are of course free to edit the [https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavuz_muharebe_kruvaz%C3%B6r%C3%BC Turkish article].

::The ship may be more famous ''to Turks'' for the events after she was renamed, but not to the English-speaking world, which remembers her for two reasons, both of which occurred under the German flag: 1) as a critical part of Germany's naval arms race with Britain in the final years before World War One, a race that played a heavy role in driving Britain into the conflict, and 2) for her successful escape to Constantinople with her companion ''Breslau'' in the early weeks of the war, a terrible failure for the Royal Navy which helped guarantee that the Ottoman Empire would join Germany's side. That second reason is discussed at length in ''[[The Guns of August]]'', Barbara Tuchman's famous book on the opening days of the war; she devotes an entire chapter to ''Goeben's'' escape and argues that it had immensely far-reaching consequences for the history of the 20th century, especially in the Middle East. The critical thing here was not that ''Goeben'' became Turkish, but that the Ottomans became Germany's ally. I agree that, from the ship's perspective, ''Goeben's'' career under Turkey was obviously the most important part of it, but I think her political role under Germany trumps that. In any case, most English sources that discuss her do so under the name ''Goeben'', and I doubt most English-speaking buffs of naval history and World War One history would even recognize her under her Turkish name. --[[User:Colin Douglas Howell|Colin Douglas Howell]] ([[User talk:Colin Douglas Howell|talk]]) 19:08, 28 July 2014 (UTC)
:::all this above + the ship was originally a german ship in german navy service with some well known war actions + it's quite common to keep ship articles under the original name. --[[User:Denniss|Denniss]] ([[User talk:Denniss|talk]]) 22:41, 28 July 2014 (UTC)

== last days ==

My introduction to SMS Goeben/Yavuz was in a coffetable book Anthony Preston's &quot;Battleships 1856-1977&quot; (Chartwell Books, 1977). It is noted in the closing pages that Yavuz was a museum ship in its last days, often &quot;crewed&quot; by only a caretaker and his cat. The scrapping of Yavuz left only USS Texas as an example of a Dreadnaught Era battleship. --[[User:Naaman Brown|Naaman Brown]] ([[User talk:Naaman Brown|talk]]) 11:29, 28 July 2014 (UTC)
:I think I have that book - I'll give it a look. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 20:55, 28 July 2014 (UTC)

=='Yavuz' pic.==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-B0032, Großer Kreuzer Goeben.jpg|200px|left]]
Article caption states this is &quot;''Yavuz'' steaming at full speed.&quot; However, summary box with this pic. from [[Bundesarchiv]] identifies it as ''Goeben'' and indicates it was taken before WWI, i.e.. before ''Goeben'' became ''Yavuz''.
