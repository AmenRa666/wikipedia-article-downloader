==Operations - examples==

I am an employee of QinetiQ and do not think that the examples given under operations (Cerberus, SURVIVE) present an accurate picture of the range of QinetiQ's work. A few examples that would be of more interest to the wikipedia user are:  

- more than 2,000 of QinetiQ's Talon robots have now been deployed to Iraq an Afghanistan most of which are being used to locate and remotely disable roadside bombs

- QinetiQ's SPO stand-off threat detection system has been sold to the US Transportation Security Administration for use at American railway stations and airports
(http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article3181926.ece)

- QinetiQ's Zephyr, solar powered unmanned aerial vehicle recently flew for three and a half days - an unofficial world record for longest duration unmanned flight.
(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2608943/Solar-powered-spy-plane-breaks-flight-record.html)

A significant amount of our income come from services not products so if product examples are used it is also worth making this point for clarity.  

Shall I edit the examples?

[[QinetiQ]] → [[Qinetiq]] — [[MOS:TM]]: use normal capitalisation for trademarks. [[User:ENeville|ENeville]] ([[User talk:ENeville|talk]]) 20:27, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

===Survey===

* '''Oppose''' - QinetiQ Group PLC is the actual registered name of the company, the capitalised second 'q' is not merely part of the trademark, it is part of the legal name of the company. [[User:Rangoon11|Rangoon11]] ([[User talk:Rangoon11|talk]]) 20:56, 3 December 2010 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''  &quot;QinetiQ&quot; is used by the company, and in most sources; &quot;Qinetiq&quot; is less common, but still frequently used (and in several results in the first page of a Google News search ([http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8154074/Military-testing-site-damaging-local-homes.html][http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-business-on-leo-quinn-chief-executive-qinetiq-2138077.html][http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11810177]), and it isn't CamelCase, as the capitalisation isn't for separate elements or syllables of the name. Companies House uses upper case for all company names, and it is unclear whether company names are officially case sensitive - is there a way to determine what the official version of the name is?

*'''Support''' as per [[WP:MOSTM]]: &quot;Choose the style that most closely resembles standard English, regardless of the preference of the trademark owner&quot;, and &quot;follow standard English text formatting and capitalization rules, even if the trademark owner considers nonstandard formatting &quot;official&quot;.  Standard English would write &quot;Qinetiq&quot;, and there is no good reason to depart from this, which I think makes it an open-and-shut case.  The argument that the formal name includes the second cap is very weak indeed: firstly I don't believe that capitalisation features in formal company naming (I wonder how far I'd get if I tried to register a new company called &quot;Qinetiq Group&quot;...?), and secondly, it wouldn't matter if it did: we should still use standard English.  What is used in company accounts is no help: such documents will of course generally follow the client's preference.  This encyclopaedia is written in standard English, and we don't have to use something else to please any company.

*::I didn't say anything about words; please don't misrepresent my argument.  What I said was &quot;lexical elements&quot;.  In this case, what I mean by that is that the capitalized &quot;Q&quot; is not pronounced as, or intended to be interpreted as, a separate element.  That makes a purely decorative (rather than semantic) use of medial capitalization, and thus should not be considered a CamelCase exception to our usual MOSCAPS guidelines.

:::::::Yes, but the fact that both are in use means that ... both are in use, so using &quot;Qinetiq&quot; is emphatically ''not'' &quot;inventing a new style&quot;, as Dicklyon suggested.  In fact, it's an established style that, while less common, better fits our internal style conventions.

:::::::: Would you like to change FedEx to Fedex? Or MetroPCS to Metropcs? It seems that policy is firstly vague, and that a particular interpretation of that policy is sometimes being rigidly being applied with little interest in what works best for WP readers. FedEx is a much better known company by consumers and Fedex would be far more quickly challenged by readers on the article talk page. This company is much lower profile so it can sit on the current name with less challenge. It is faintly ridiculous nonetheless.[[User:Rangoon11|Rangoon11]] ([[User talk:Rangoon11|talk]]) 16:22, 5 August 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::No, because in those cases the capitalization is used to indicate that a new lexical element is being introduced.  The terminal capital Q in &quot;QinetiQ&quot; is nothing but ornamentation; it carries no semantic or lexical meaning.  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:LtPowers|T]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:23, 5 August 2012 (UTC)
::::::OK, Powers, I take your point.  We do sometimes take the threshold for things like &quot;in use&quot; at below 5 or 10%; for example, 10% lowercase is good evidence of term not being &quot;consistently capitalized in sources&quot;, so we go with lower case; and 10% en dash instead of hyphen is good evidence that in styles that distinguish, the en dash is probably correct.  To be consistent, I should probably interpret MOS:TM with a similarly low threshold; &quot;the majority&quot; that Rangoon11 refers to is not relevant here.  So I withdraw my support; but I think I'll remain neutral and see what others converge on in this case.  I'm not worried about Fedex and Metropcs being issues, as I don't see those in any reputable sources, and the caps are largely required there to indicate the separate lexical elements, unlike the stylized Q in QinetiQ.

::::::: The percentage here is unknowable however. I think we would all agree that QinetiQ is by some margin the most &quot;common&quot; name, but trying to ascribe a percentage to that is essentially impossible. [[User:Rangoon11|Rangoon11]] ([[User talk:Rangoon11|talk]]) 16:52, 5 August 2012 (UTC)
::::::::I think nobody disputes that QinetiQ is &quot;most common&quot;, but that's not what [[MOS:TM]] suggests we go with.  I agree that it's difficult to quantify percentages, which is why we have criteria like &quot;in use&quot;; judgement is required.

*'''Support'''; more accurate and more common name. I don't see any particularly strong reason, here, for internal wikipedia norms to overrule real-world usage. [[User:Bobrayner|bobrayner]] ([[User talk:Bobrayner|talk]]) 11:07, 9 August 2012 (UTC)
**Real-world usage is very often &quot;Qinetiq&quot;, as illustrated by the links above.  What other real-world usage do you mean?  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:LtPowers|T]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:40, 9 August 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' I don't see this as a case of CamelCase but rather stylistic. The general definition of camelcase requires that it be inner uppercase letters and/or a compound word in which the elements are joined without spaces; This case is neither and thus entirely stylistic. I might be on board if there was phonetic reasons (e.g. it was pronounced &quot;kineti cue&quot; not &quot;kinetic&quot;) but that's not the case. So, I oppose on basis of [[MOS:TM]]--[[User:Labattblueboy|Labattblueboy]] ([[User talk:Labattblueboy|talk]]) 13:20, 24 August 2012 (UTC)

== Hacking Scandal Neutrality? ==

They report at http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=27c_1367474517 seems to present some very damning evidence of how bad QinetiQ's problem has been with their entire computer network being compromised for years to hackers.  The article here seems to go very easy/light on QinetiQ, almost as if it was written by them for damage control.  Is there a bit of a biased tone and a lot left out in the section about the hacking scandal?  It has been a huge topic within all of the DoD and a major concern, so it's hard for me to read the section in this article as being very neutral.... or is it that is deserves its own article not part of this page?
