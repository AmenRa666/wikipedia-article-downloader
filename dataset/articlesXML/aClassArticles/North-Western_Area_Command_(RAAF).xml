'''North-Western Area Command''' was one of several [[RAAF area commands|geographically based commands]] raised by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) during World War&amp;nbsp;II. Its wartime sphere of operations included the [[Northern Territory]], adjacent portions of [[Queensland]] and [[Western Australia]], and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The command was formed in January 1942, following the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]], from the western part of [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area Command]], which had covered all of northern Australia and [[Territory of Papua|Papua]]. Headquartered at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], North-Western Area Command was initially responsible for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]], [[aerial reconnaissance]] and protection of the [[sea lane]]s within its boundaries.

In the [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|official history of the RAAF in the Pacific theatre]], [[George Odgers]] described the [[North-Western Area Campaign]] as &quot;almost entirely an air war, with raid and counter-raid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070532--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 42]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1943, North-Western Area Command's role became increasingly offensive in nature, as the Allies began to advance in New Guinea and the Dutch East Indies. The command continued to operate following the end of the war, its boundaries being reduced to Australian territory. In February 1954, its responsibilities were subsumed by the RAAF's newly established functional command-and-control system; the headquarters was disbanded the following year.

==History==

===World War II===

====Formation====
[[File:RAAFAreaCommands1941.png|thumb|left|upright=1.28|alt=Map of Australia showing state borders, with RAAF area command boundaries superimposed|RAAF area commands in December 1941]]
North-Western Area Command was formed at [[RAAF Base Darwin|RAAF Station Darwin]], Northern Territory, on 15&amp;nbsp;January 1942, taking over the western portion of what was [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area Command]].&lt;ref name=Gillison311&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070486--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 311]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North-Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Area had been established on 8&amp;nbsp;May 1941 as one of the RAAF's four [[RAAF area commands|geographically based command-and-control zones]], and covered northern [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], the [[Northern Territory]], and [[Territory of Papua|Papua]].&lt;ref name=Gillison91&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070554--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 91–92]&lt;/ref&gt; The roles of the area commands were  [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]], protection of adjacent [[sea lane]]s, and [[aerial reconnaissance]]. Each was led by an [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) responsible for the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary.&lt;ref name=Gillison91/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pathfinder121&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Organising for war: The RAAF air campaigns in the Pacific | magazine = Pathfinder |issue= 121| date = October 2009| url = http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Publications/Details/403/121-Organising-for-War-The-RAAF-Air-Campaigns-in-the-Pacific.aspx|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of the [[Pacific War]] in December 1941 was the catalyst for Northern Area being split into North-Western Area (NWA) and [[North-Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|North-Eastern Area]] (NEA), to counter distinct Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea, respectively.&lt;ref name=Gillison311/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens111&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; NWA's inaugural AOC was Air Commodore Douglas Wilson.&lt;ref name=Ashworth302&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp. 302–304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=5256735|title=Wilson, Douglas Ernest Lancelot|work=RAAF Officers Personnel Files|page=25|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His senior air staff officer was Group Captain [[Frederick Scherger]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Staff numbered 137, including twenty-four officers.&lt;ref&gt;North-Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In early February 1942, Air Commodore [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], soon to be appointed [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], inspected NWA and found the morale and serviceability of its combat units—[[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;2]], [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|12]] and [[No. 13 Squadron RAAF|13&amp;nbsp;Squadrons]]—to be lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''The Private Air Marshal'', p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

====1942–43: Raids and counter-raids====
On 19&amp;nbsp;February 1942, NWA's complement of aircraft included seventeen [[Lockheed Hudson]] light bombers of Nos.&amp;nbsp;2 and 13 Squadrons based at Darwin and [[Daly Waters Airfield|Daly Waters]], fourteen obsolescent [[CAC Wirraway]] fighters of No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron based at Darwin and [[Batchelor Airfield|Batchelor]], and ten [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40&amp;nbsp;Kittyhawk]] fighters of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) that were transitting through Darwin to [[Java]]. Half of the Hudsons were without crews, five of the Wirraways were out of service, and the Kittyhawk pilots were considered inexperienced. In Wilson's absence at [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|ABDA Command Headquarters]] in Java, Scherger was acting AOC. Just before 10&amp;nbsp;am, Darwin suffered its [[Bombing of Darwin|first air raid]] by the Japanese, a force of 188 aircraft that bombed the harbour and town.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070514--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 424–427]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grose, ''An Awkward Truth'', pp. 35, 53, 81&lt;/ref&gt; A further attack by fifty-four bombers, directed mainly at the RAAF airfield, followed at around midday.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070514--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 429–430]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grose, ''An Awkward Truth'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The raids on 19&amp;nbsp;February destroyed civil and military infrastructure, twenty-three aircraft and ten ships, and killed approximately 250&amp;nbsp;people. As well, 278&amp;nbsp;RAAF personnel deserted Darwin in an exodus that became known as the &quot;[[Adelaide River, Northern Territory|Adelaide River]] Stakes&quot;.&lt;ref name=Stephens136&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 136–138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grose, ''An Awkward Truth'', pp. 225–231&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;There was&quot;, in Scherger's words, &quot;an awful panic and a lot of men simply [[The Bush|went bush]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, ''Australia Under Attack'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The Kittyhawks and anti-aircraft gunners were credited with shooting down five Japanese aircraft and probably destroying five others.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070514--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 431–432]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the disaster, NWA headquarters moved to a bush camp south of the RAAF Station, and the senior leadership was changed.&lt;ref name=Stephens136/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070515--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 468–469]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson and Scherger were posted out, the latter in spite of being praised for his actions during the attack by the Federal government's commission of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North-Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Air Commodore [[Frank Bladin]] took over as AOC on 25&amp;nbsp;March, his initial objectives being to restore morale and deal with the perceived threat of an imminent invasion, tasks complicated by poor communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=Stephens145&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison554-559&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070727--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 554–559]&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeding to instigate more intense combat training and construct new satellite airfields with which to disperse his forces, Bladin became, in the words of Air Force historian Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and the first Australian in the Pacific theatre to be decorated by the Americans when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry after personally leading a raid by USAAF [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses]] on [[Celebes]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref name=Stephens145/&gt; Despite northern Australia's obvious vulnerability to attack, NWA was without a garrison of interceptors until the arrival in March and April of three squadrons of USAAF Kittyhawks comprising the 49th Pursuit Group (soon redesignated the [[49th Operations Group|49th Fighter Group]]) under the command of Colonel [[Paul Wurtsmith]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 133–136&lt;/ref&gt; The Darwin area would suffer a total sixty-four air raids between February 1942 and November 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 133, 310&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 20&amp;nbsp;April 1942, operational authority over all RAAF combat infrastructure, including area commands, was invested in the newly established Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters under [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area Command]] (SWPA).&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 473]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers15&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070530--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 15–16]&lt;/ref&gt; NWA's boundaries were finetuned in August: as well as covering the Northern Territory, the command took responsibility for the portion of [[Western Australia]] north of a line drawn south-east from [[Yampi Sound]] to the Northern Territory border, and part of Queensland adjacent to the [[Barkly Tableland]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070519--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 588]&lt;/ref&gt; The 49th Fighter Group flew its final sorties in August and transferred to New Guinea the following month, having claimed seventy-nine Japanese aircraft destroyed for the loss of twenty-one Kittyhawks.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 195, 249&lt;/ref&gt; NWA's two Hudson squadrons had meanwhile conducted unescorted bombing missions against Japanese bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s, and in support of [[Sparrow Force]] on [[Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070521--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 643]&lt;/ref&gt;  Three RAAF fighter squadrons—[[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;76]] and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77]] equipped with Kittyhawks and [[No. 31 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;31]] equipped with [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s—arrived in September and October.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070521--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 646]&lt;/ref&gt; September also saw the formation of [[RAAF Command]], led by Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070519--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 585–588]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers4&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070530--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 4–6]&lt;/ref&gt; Bostock exercised overall control of air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold administrative authority over Australian units.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin's remit was to defend the Northern Territory, the northern coast of Western Australia, and the [[Torres Strait]], protecting the flank of General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s offensives in New Guinea. Bostock was to coordinate operations when they involved more than one area command, for instance when the fighter squadrons of both NWA and NEA were required to repulse a major attack.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070532--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 39, 42]&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1942, NWA's flying units included six RAAF squadrons operating mainly Kittyhawks, Beaufighters, Hudsons, and [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] dive bombers, as well as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit, which flew a mix of Wirraways, [[Brewster Buffalo]]s, [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38 Lightning]]s and [[Republic P-43 Lancer|P-43 Lancer]]s and continued to operate out of the Darwin area (as [[No. 87 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;87 Squadron]] from September 1944) for the duration of the war.&lt;ref name=Gillison649&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070521--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 649–651]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; These units were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] medium bombers and USAAF [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] heavy bombers, with which NWA was able to conduct heavier strikes against Japanese forces north of Australia.&lt;ref name=Stephens145/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison649/&gt;  Also in December, [[No. 34 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;34 (Transport) Squadron]], which had been formed under NWA's control in Darwin four days after the first air raid, divested its aircraft to the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;6 Communications Unit, which remained in the Northern Territory until disbanding shortly after the end of hostilities.&lt;ref name=Gillison481&gt;Gillison, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 481]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 41, 128&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 44 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;44 RDF Wing]] was formed under NWA at Adelaide River on 14&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref name=Odgers41&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070532--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 41–42]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, ''A Saga of Achievement'', pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; It was responsible for the [[radar]] stations that acted as an early warning system for Japanese attacks.&lt;ref name=Odgers41/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;{{cite news|title=Williamtown RAAF 70 years celebration|work=[[Newcastle Herald]]|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/1288659/gallery-williamtown-raaf-70-years-celebration/|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=8 February 2013|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wing coordinated air defence in the region with [[No. 5 Fighter Sector RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 Fighter Sector Headquarters]].&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; As the raids continued into 1943, Bladin placed his bombers inland and his fighters close to the coast, where they could intercept the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070532--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 43]&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 61 Wing RAAF|No. 61 (Works) Wing]] was responsible for airfield construction squadrons and their associated support units.&lt;ref name=Odgers41/&gt; According to historian Chris Coulthard-Clark, NWA was &quot;one of the few areas where the RAAF was free to run its own show&quot; in World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=SWPA13&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin often employed his own judgement in selecting targets for offensive strikes, as detailed directives from superior headquarters were not always forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]], destroying or damaging twenty-two Japanese bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin.&lt;ref name=Odgers46-50&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070532--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 46–50]&lt;/ref&gt;

To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom and became operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]] under Group Captain [[Allan Walters]].&lt;ref name=Gillison649/&gt; A [[Raid on Darwin (2 May 1943)|major engagement over Darwin]] on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in the loss of five Spitfires during combat, and several others in forced landings owing to fuel starvation or engine failure, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. Bladin immediately ordered a retaliatory Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption (correct as it happened) that this was where the Japanese raiders were based; four enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.&lt;ref name=Odgers46-50/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 297, 300&lt;/ref&gt; Between March and May 1943, the number of sorties flown by NWA's combat squadrons rose from 211 to 469. The Allies claimed a total of forty-six Japanese aircraft destroyed for the loss of thirty of their own on operations, seventeen to enemy action and thirteen from other causes.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070532--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=Odgers59-60&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070533--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 59–60]&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, the USAAF's [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under NWA's control, enhancing its strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=Odgers61&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070533--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 61]&lt;/ref&gt;  By this time, NWA headquarters staff numbered 385, including ninety-six officers.&lt;ref&gt;North-Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

====1943–45: Offensive operations====
Bladin handed over NWA to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943. Cole reported that the command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;, but considered its air defence capability inadequate, recommending augmentation by long-range fighters such as Lightnings. He nevertheless had to make do with the three Spitfire squadrons of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Wing, and the possibility of calling on the USAAF's [[Fifth Air Force]] for reinforcements as necessary.&lt;ref name=Odgers104&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070556--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 104–105]&lt;/ref&gt; Having started out as a primarily defensive command, by mid-1943 NWA was able to support Allied advances in New Guinea.&lt;ref name=SWPA62&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; During August and September, Cole reduced regular reconnaissance missions to &quot;increase bombing activity to the limit&quot;, following a request from MacArthur to provide all available support for Allied assaults on [[Landing at Lae|Lae]]–[[Landing at Nadzab|Nadzab]]; NWA Liberators, Hudsons, Beaufighters and [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalinas]] carried out raids to destroy Japanese bases and aircraft, and divert enemy forces from Allied columns.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070556--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 111–112]&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 79 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing]] was established under the aegis of NWA at Batchelor on 30&amp;nbsp;November 1943.

By December 1943, the character of the air war in northern Australia had changed markedly, as the Japanese were no longer able to mount air raids against Darwin; rather than merely securing NWA, Cole was keen to adopt an offensive strategy in the Dutch East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070556--1-.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 120–121]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Horner]], &quot;In the sense that he had to plan and conduct his own campaign, the AOC Northwestern Area was one of the RAAF's few operational level commanders, even if the campaign was somewhat static and limited&quot;.&lt;ref name=SWPA62/&gt; During March–April 1944, NWA had thirteen squadrons under its control, including those of No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing, and supported [[amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]] against [[Operations Reckless and Persecution|Hollandia and Aitape]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070562--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 215–219]&lt;/ref&gt; In May, its aircraft bombed [[Surabaya]] as part of [[Operation Transom]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/14.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 229]&lt;/ref&gt; Under NWA's direction, No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing took part in the [[Battle of Noemfoor|Allied attack on Noemfoor]] in June–July; sorties by all NWA aircraft in July totalled 704.&lt;ref&gt;[https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070730--1-.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 243–247]&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing was subsequently earmarked for transfer from NWA to [[Northern Command (RAAF)|Northern Command]] (formerly [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Operational Group]]) in [[Papua New Guinea]], to undertake operations against the Japanese in [[New Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp. 297-299&quot;&gt;[https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070565--1-.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 297–299]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070397--1-.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 379]&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 Wing received two fresh British squadrons of Spitfires in July, to replace two that had been transferred to [[No. 80 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;80 Wing]], which had formed in Darwin for a planned assault on [[Selaru]] that did not eventuate.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070730--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 245]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Spitfire Aces of Burma and the Pacific'', p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;44 Wing was disbanded on 22&amp;nbsp;August 1944, and its radar stations divested to other units in the area.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; The same month, No.&amp;nbsp;61 Wing departed the Northern Territory for [[Morotai|Morotai Island]], where it later came under the control of the RAAF's main mobile strike force, [[Australian First Tactical Air Force|First Tactical Air Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp. 297-299&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070730--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 249]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1944, Cole handed NWA over to Air Commodore [[Alan Charlesworth]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070730--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 246]&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage of the war, the Allies were advancing north and the tempo of operations in the Darwin area had decreased.&lt;ref name=Odgers362&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070396--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 362–365]&lt;/ref&gt; Charlesworth raised concerns regarding No.&amp;nbsp;80 Wing, warning higher command that its morale would drop if it was not either given a more active role in the war or transferred to southern Australia for rest.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070730--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 246–247]&lt;/ref&gt; By October, the wing had received orders to depart NWA for Morotai to join the First Tactical Air Force; this left NWA with twelve squadrons at its disposal, including one Liberator unit and three other Spitfire squadrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp. 297-299&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air Force Australia'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, NWA supported the [[Battle of Leyte|assault on Leyte]] with attacks on enemy ports, oil facilities, and shipping in the Dutch East Indies using Beaufighters, Mitchells, and Liberators. These operations continued through November and December.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070566--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 301–302, 313–316]&lt;/ref&gt; By then, NWA headquarters staff numbered 651, including 156 officers.&lt;ref&gt;North-Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The same month Charlesworth assumed command, [[No. 76 Wing RAAF|No. 76 Wing]] arrived from [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]], Queensland, to coordinate and control [[Minelayer|minelaying]] operations in NWA by three Catalina squadrons.&lt;ref name=Odgers362/&gt; The Catalinas mined [[Manila Bay]] in December 1944, to support the [[Battle of Mindoro|Allied landing at Mindoro]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070397--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 375–376]&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No. 82 (Heavy Bomber) Wing]]—the RAAF's first—became operational under NWA's control at [[Fenton Airfield]] on 11&amp;nbsp;January 1945. Comprising two Liberator squadrons, the wing replaced the USAAF's 380th Group when the latter was transferred to the Fifth Air Force in the Philippines. The Liberators of No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing sank seven Japanese ships in the Dutch East Indies during March.&lt;ref name=Nelmes91&gt;Nelmes, ''Tocumwal to Tarakan'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070398--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 400–404]&lt;/ref&gt; On 6&amp;nbsp;April, all of its available aircraft joined Mitchells of No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser ''[[Japanese cruiser Isuzu|Isuzu]]''. Anti-aircraft fire and attacks by enemy fighters resulted in the loss of two Liberators; Allied submarines sank the damaged ''Isuzu'' the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070398--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 405–409]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another squadron of Liberators was added to No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing's strength in late-April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Nelmes, ''Tocumwal to Tarakan'', pp. 107–109&lt;/ref&gt; The bombers attacked targets in Java in the lead-up to Operation Oboe One, the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|invasion of Tarakan]], which commenced on 1&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070401--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 451–455]&lt;/ref&gt; During this and the two subsequent Oboe operations, the [[Battle of North Borneo|invasions of Labuan]] and [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Balikpapan]], NWA was responsible for mining operations, convoy escort, aerial reconnaissance, and attacks on Japanese bases and troops.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, ''Oboe'', pp. iii, 124&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;76 Wing's Catalinas mined harbours as far north as Hong Kong and the Gulf of Hainan, China.&lt;ref name=SWPA13/&gt; By July, NWA had been denuded of much of its offensive capability as Nos.&amp;nbsp;79 and 82 Wings had been transferred to the First Tactical Air Force in Morotai. [[No. 85 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;85 Wing]] was formed the same month under NWA's control; it comprised two Liberator squadrons but only one became operational before the end of the Pacific War.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070402--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 476–477]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BomberUnits&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 36, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war activity and disbandment===

Following the end of the war in August 1945, SWPA was dissolved and RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne again assumed full control of all its operational formations, including the area commands.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;  The Liberator and Catalina squadrons were mainly used for repatriating Australian prisoners of war.&lt;ref name=BomberUnits/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 29, 79&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;76 and 85 Wings were disbanded at Darwin in November.&lt;ref name=DVA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clik.dva.gov.au/history-library/part-3-order-battle/ch-2-order-battle-air-force/s-2-headquarters|title=Order of Battle&amp;nbsp;– Air Force&amp;nbsp;– Headquarters|publisher=[[Department of Veterans' Affairs (Australia)|Department of Veterans' Affairs]]|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin would subsequently function mainly as a transit centre and a base for peacetime exercises, rather than as a permanent station for flying squadrons.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; Charlesworth continued to serve as AOC NWA until January 1946, when Group Captain [[Frank Headlam]], formerly NWA's senior administrative staff officer, took over as [[officer commanding]] (OC). Headlam remained in command until October, by which time the headquarters staff numbered 108, including twenty-three officers.&lt;ref&gt;North-Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, proposed reducing the five extant mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, [[Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|Eastern]], [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern]], and [[Western Area Command (RAAF)|Western Areas]]) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern Area, covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The Federal government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries essentially remained in place (although NWA no longer covered the Dutch East Indies).&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''The Private Air Marshal'', pp. 321–325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solo68&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 68, 462&lt;/ref&gt;

Between October 1949 and February 1950, NWA hosted its largest exercise since the war when No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing [[Avro Lincoln]]s, specially modified with advanced radar and other instrumentation, flew into and out of Darwin as part of Operation Cumulative, a joint program with the [[Royal Air Force]] gathering long-range navigation and bombing data for use in potential air campaigns against the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 445–449&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North-Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', pp. 228, 230, 240&lt;/ref&gt; Wing Commander [[Glen Cooper]] served as OC NWA from September 1952 to December 1953.&lt;ref&gt;North-Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', pp. 300, 324&lt;/ref&gt; Commencing in October 1953, the RAAF was reorganised from a geographically based command-and-control system into one based on function. In February 1954, the newly constituted functional organisations—[[RAAF Home Command|Home]], [[RAAF Training Command|Training]], and Maintenance Commands—assumed control of all Air Force operations, training and maintenance from North-Western Area Command.&lt;ref name=Pathfinder121/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 73–76, 462–463&lt;/ref&gt; NWA headquarters remained in existence, but only as one of Home Command's &quot;remote control points&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23429331 |title=Battle 'nerve-centre' goes north: RAAF fighting control shifted from here |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=21 May 1954 |accessdate=31 July 2015 |page=5 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters was finally disbanded on 29&amp;nbsp;June 1955.&lt;ref name=DVA/&gt;
