[[Air Commodore]] '''Francis William Fellowes (Frank) Lukis''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (27&amp;nbsp;July 1896&amp;nbsp;– 18&amp;nbsp;February 1966) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). A veteran of World War&amp;nbsp;I, he first saw combat as a soldier in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. In 1917, Lukis transferred to the [[Australian Flying Corps]] and flew with [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]], where he was twice [[mentioned in despatches]]. A member of the Australian Air Corps following the war, he transferred to the fledgling RAAF in 1921, and became the first Commanding Officer of the newly re-formed [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, in 1925.

Lukis went on to lead No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in the early 1930s, and was promoted to [[group captain]] in 1938. Appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year, he was in charge of [[RAAF Williams#Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]], Victoria, during the early years of World War&amp;nbsp;II. He later held forward commands in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]], including [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area]] (later [[North-Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|North-Eastern Area]]), for which he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]], and [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Operational Group]] (later [[Northern Command (RAAF)|Northern Command]]). Lukis also served on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body, as [[Air Member for Personnel (Australia)|Air Member for Personnel]]. After retirement from the Air Force in 1946, he became a manager with [[Australian National Airways]], and was active in veterans' associations. He died in 1966 at the age of sixty-nine.

Born on 27&amp;nbsp;July 1896 in [[Balingup, Western Australia|Balingup]], Western Australia, Frank Lukis was the son of [[Pastoral farming|grazier]] William Fellowes Lukis and his wife Jean.

There it took part in the campaign against the Turks in [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], including the [[Battle of Romani]].&lt;ref name=&quot;10LHR&quot;/&gt;

Lukis was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in July 1916 and promoted to [[lieutenant]] in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF Project&quot;/&gt; On 25&amp;nbsp;February 1917, he transferred to the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC) and was posted to [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] (also known until 1918 as No.&amp;nbsp;67 Squadron, [[Royal Flying Corps]]), operating in [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai and Palestine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.9&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook reconnaissance missions as an observer in [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]]s from April to September 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack p.71&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/06.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 71]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1918 he completed pilot training and began flying fighter and ground attack sorties in [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF in SWPA&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', pp. 37–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack p.116&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/09.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 116–117]&lt;/ref&gt; He was twice [[mentioned in despatches]] for distinguished service with the AFC in the Middle East, the first [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 16&amp;nbsp;January 1918, and the second on 12&amp;nbsp;January 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30480|supp=yes|startpage=929|endpage=937|date=16 January 1918|accessdate=on 12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31728|supp=yes|startpage=500|endpage=507|date=12 January 1920|accessdate=on 12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lukis finished the war a [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]] with the temporary rank of [[Captain (land)|captain]], and returned to Australia on 5&amp;nbsp;March 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF Project&quot;/&gt;

With the disbandment of the wartime AFC, Lukis joined the short-lived Australian Air Corps early in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to the newly formed [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in March the following year. Ranked [[flying officer]] (honorary [[flight lieutenant]]), he was one of the original twenty-one officers on the Air Force's strength at its formation, and became popularly known as &quot;Luke&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/01.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1922, he surveyed the air route between Perth and [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]], South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in one of the embryonic service's earliest public flying displays in May that year, when he and another pilot flew [[Airco DH.9]]s in mock [[dogfight]]s with four [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s during the New South Wales Aerial Pageant at [[Victoria Park, Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; On 21&amp;nbsp;January 1925, he married Florence St Aubyn Allen at St Mary's Anglican Church, West Perth; the couple later had two sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;  The previous year, Lukis had been best man at the wedding of Squadron Leader [[Frank McNamara (VC)|Frank McNamara]], the AFC's only [[Victoria Cross]] recipient in World War&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''A Hero's Dilemma'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] was re-formed at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria, on 1&amp;nbsp;July 1925, with Lukis as its [[Commanding Officer]] (CO). Over the next week, operating DH.9s and S.E.5s, the unit established itself at the Air Force's newest base, [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance&quot;&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 21–23, 123&lt;/ref&gt; Alerted to a forthcoming inspection by the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Group Captain [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], Lukis had the foresight to engage in a speedy beautification program at the base, arranging delivery of pot plants and shrubs; the notoriously fastidious Williams concluded the inspection by pronouncing himself &quot;happily surprised&amp;nbsp;... that so much had been done so quickly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; For the duration of his tour as No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron commander, Lukis doubled as CO of the base. He was promoted [[squadron leader]] on 2&amp;nbsp;July 1927, and handed over command to Squadron Leader [[Harry Cobby]] on 13&amp;nbsp;January 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance&quot;/&gt; Lukis served as CO of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron from 1930 to 1934, interrupted in 1931 by a posting to Britain to  attend [[RAF Staff College, Andover]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Raised to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]], he was placed in charge of [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]], Victoria, in 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; He held command of [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at Point Cook from January 1938 to November 1939, receiving appointment as an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1938 [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]], and promotion to [[group captain]] in July the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashworth295&quot;&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34518 |supp=yes|startpage=3696|date=7 June 1938|accessdate=on 18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CO of RAAF Station Laverton from December 1939, Lukis was made acting [[air commodore]] and posted to [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], Queensland, on 8&amp;nbsp;May 1941 as the inaugural [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 92]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', pp. 291, 295&lt;/ref&gt; Described by Major General [[Lewis H. Brereton]], commander of the US [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]], as &quot;a dark, husky, energetic man with a keen sense of humour&quot; who was very much &quot;alive to the situation&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 298]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/08.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 184–185]&lt;/ref&gt; Lukis was in charge of air defence for the north coast of Australia. His task was complicated by the poor standard and quantity of available equipment, with only [[CAC Wirraway]]s as fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF in SWPA&quot;/&gt; In January 1942, Northern Area was split into [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area]] and [[North-Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|North-Eastern Area]], Lukis remaining in charge of the latter as a temporary air commodore.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; The following month, he warned higher command of the poor state of preparedness and low morale of [[Australian Army]] troops at [[Port Moresby]], New Guinea, due to lack of air cover and apparent lack of interest from government echelons. In March, seventeen [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawks]] of [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron]], newly formed under North-Eastern Area Command, were deployed; the unit would shortly distinguish itself in the [[Battle of Port Moresby]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/08.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 447–448,458–462]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of April 1942, Lukis' forces consisted of three squadrons (general purpose, transport, and fighter) at Townsville, one general purpose squadron at [[RAAF Base Amberley|RAAF Station Amberley]] in southern Queensland, and four squadrons (three general purpose and one fighter) at Port Moresby.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, as Air Member for Personnel, he handed over command of North-Eastern Area to Group Captain (later Air Commodore) Harry Cobby on 25&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/28.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 588]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', pp. 293–295&lt;/ref&gt; On 23&amp;nbsp;March 1943, Lukis was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for the &quot;courage, enterprise and devotion&quot; that he had displayed at North-Eastern Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35954|supp=yes|startpage=1413|date=23 March 1943|accessdate=on 18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00317/003170590.pdf Recommendation for Francis William Fellowes Lukis to be awarded a Commander of the Order of the British Empire] at Australian War Memorial. Retrieved on 18 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As Air Member for Personnel, he occupied a seat on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body that was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In this position he clashed with Group Officer [[Clare Stevenson]], Director of the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]], over plans to reduce the number of female officers in technical roles. Stevenson was forced to apologise to Lukis for going over his head to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to voice her opposition to the scheme; nevertheless, cuts to these positions did not eventuate.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', pp. 218–220&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1943, Lukis took over [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Operational Group]] (No.&amp;nbsp;9 OG), the RAAF's main mobile formation in the Pacific at the time, after its commander, Air Commodore [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]], was sacked by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], over allegations of poor discipline and morale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.122-123&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/06.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 102–103]&lt;/ref&gt; The change in leadership dismayed the US-led [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area Command]], whose senior air officers, Lieutenant General [[George Kenney]] and Major General [[Ennis Whitehead]], did not hold Lukis in the same high regard that they did his predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.122-123&quot;/&gt; For the next two months, No.&amp;nbsp;9 OG supported the [[New Britain campaign|Allied invasion of New Britain]]. On 17&amp;nbsp;January 1944, Lukis mounted an operation with a force of seventy-three aircraft comprising [[Bristol Beaufort]] light bombers and Kittyhawk and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters, which was the largest strike undertaken by the Australians to that date. However it encountered no opposition, and Lukis voiced his concerns to Whitehead that the &quot;mopping up&quot; role he had been assigned was costing his fighter pilots the opportunity to engage in air-to-air combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF in SWPA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan pp. 129-130&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/08.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 129–130]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Pacific conflict shifted further north, No.&amp;nbsp;9 OG's operational tasking lessened and it became colloquially known in the RAAF as the &quot;Non-Ops Group&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF in SWPA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan pp. 129-130&quot;/&gt; When ordered to transfer one of his fighter wings, [[No. 73 Wing RAAF|No. 73]], to the [[Admiralty Islands campaign|Admiralty Islands]] for convoy escort in late February, Lukis complained directly to Kenney that it was a waste of resources, but was over-ruled.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/11.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 170–171]&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of No.&amp;nbsp;9 OG became a garrison force in New Guinea, and was renamed [[Northern Command (RAAF)|Northern Command]] on 11&amp;nbsp;April 1944 to better reflect this new status; its original mobile strike role was taken over by No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group (later the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 144, 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/12.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 182–183,198–200]&lt;/ref&gt; Lukis was again considered for the position of Air Member for Personnel when the incumbent, acting Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]], was removed from his position following accusations of drunkenness at an RAAF Headquarters meeting in November 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson p.187&quot;&gt;Helson, [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/unsworks:3230/SOURCE02?view=true ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp. 187–190]&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, Lukis remained in charge of Northern Command.
