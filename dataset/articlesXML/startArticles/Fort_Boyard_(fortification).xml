'''Fort Boyard''' ({{IPA-fr|fɔʁ bɔjaʀ|pron}}) is a fort located between the [[Île-d'Aix]] and the [[Oléron|Île d'Oléron]] in the [[Pertuis d'Antioche]] straits, on the west coast of France and is the filming location for the [[Fort Boyard (TV series)|TV gameshow of the same name]]. Though a fort on Boyard bank was suggested as early as the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, it was not until the 1800s under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] that work began. Building started in 1801 and was completed in 1857. In 1967, the final scene of the French film ''[[Les aventuriers (1967 film)|Les aventuriers]]'' was filmed at the remains of the fort.

Fort Boyard is oval-shaped, {{convert|68|m}} long and {{convert|31|m|abbr=on}} wide. The walls were built {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} high. At the centre is a yard, and the ground floor provided stores and quarters for the men and officers. The floor above contained [[casemate]]s for the emplacements of guns and further quarters. Above that were facilities for [[barbette]] guns and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].&lt;ref name=Lepage206&gt;{{harvnb|Lepage|2009|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The construction of the fort was first considered during a build-up of the French armed forces undertaken by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]] between 1661 and 1667.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Fort Boyard was to form a line of fortification with [[Fort Enet]] and Fort de la Rade on [[Île-d'Aix]] to protect the arsenal of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] from [[Royal Navy]] incursions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barber|1999|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the limited range of artillery in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, the [[Field of fire (weaponry)|fields of fire]] between the fortifications on the islands of Aix and Oléron did not overlap. A fort on Boyard bank, roughly midway between the two, would have filled that gap. In 1692 the French engineer Descombs began planning the programme of building the fort; however, once it became clear how expensive it would be the scheme was abandoned. [[Vauban]], Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV's leading [[military engineer]], famously advised against it, saying &quot;Your Majesty, it would be easier to seize the moon with your teeth than to attempt such an undertaking in such a place&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lepage206/&gt;

After a British raid on Île-d'Aix in 1757, plans for a fort on Boyard bank were once again considered. Though plans were drawn up, the logistical problems again ensured it was abandoned. Efforts were renewed under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1800, and the following year engineers Ferregeau and [[Armand Samuel de Marescot]], and Vice-Admiral [[François Étienne de Rosily-Mesros]] designed a fort to be built on the bank. To facilitate the work, a port was established on île d'Oléron. The village of [[Boyardville]] was built for the workers. The first stage of construction was to establish a plateau, some {{convert|100|by|50|m|abbr=on}}, to act as foundations. To this end, stones were piled up on the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lepage|2009|pp=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was suspended in 1809. Construction resumed in 1837, under [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], following renewed tensions with the United Kingdom. The fortifications were completed in 1857, with sufficient room for a garrison of 250&amp;nbsp;men. However, by the time of its completion, the range of cannons had significantly increased, making the fort unnecessary for national defence.

After 1871, Fort Boyard was briefly used as a military prison, before being abandoned at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oleron-island.com/the-island-of-oleron-basin-of-marennes/heritage/fort-boyard.html |title=Fort Boyard |publisher=Oleron-island.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time went by, the fort slowly crumbled and deteriorated into the sea as it was left unmaintained. In 1950 it was made a listed building, and in 1961 was sold to Charente Maritime Regional Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bordeaux-doc.com/ville_de_rochefort/Roch/LR/Boya-uk.htm |title=Fort Boyard |publisher=Bordeaux-doc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been the filming location of both the French and international versions of the [[Fort Boyard (TV series)|TV gameshow of the same name]] since 1990, and was also the location for filming ''[[The Last Adventure (1967 film)|The Last Adventure]]'', starring [[Alain Delon]], [[Lino Ventura]] and [[Joanna Shimkus]].
