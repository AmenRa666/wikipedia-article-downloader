'''''Birdsong''''' is a 1993 [[war novel]] and [[family saga]] by the English author [[Sebastian Faulks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Winter, Jay M. |title=Remembering War: The Great War Between Memory and History in the Twentieth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBP5IArYEZcC&amp;pg=PP5 |year=2006 |location=New Haven, Connecticut|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-12752-9 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Faulks's fourth novel. The plot follows two main characters living at different times: the first is Stephen Wraysford, a British soldier on the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|front line in Amiens]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], and the second is his granddaughter, Elizabeth Benson, whose 1970s plotline follows her attempts to recover an understanding of Stephen's experience of the war.

Faulks developed the novel to bring more public awareness to the experience of war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other [[WWI novels]], thematically focuses the way in which the experience of trauma shapes individual psyches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = &quot;If they ask us why we died&quot;: Children's Literature and the First World War, 1970–2005 |url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/v031/31.2maccallum-stewart.html |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |date = 2007-01-01|issn = 1080-6563 |pages = 176–188 |volume = 31 |issue = 2 |doi = 10.1353/uni.2007.0022 |first = Esther |last = MacCallum-Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores [[metahistorical]] questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like [[Ian McEwan]]'s ''[[Atonement (novel)|Atonement]]'' and those in [[Pat Barker]]'s [[Regeneration Trilogy]].

''Birdsong'' is part of a loose trilogy of novels by Sebastian Faulks, alongside  ''[[The Girl at the Lion d'Or]]'' and ''[[Charlotte Gray (novel)|Charlotte Gray]]''; the three are linked through location, history and several minor characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/ReadersGroups/ReadersGuides.asp?isbn=9780099387916 |title=Bloomsbury Publishing |publisher=Bloomsbury.com |date= |accessdate=12 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115132207/http://www.bloomsbury.com/ReadersGroups/ReadersGuides.asp?isbn=9780099387916 |archivedate=15 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Birdsong'' is one of Faulks's best-received works, earning both critical and popular praise, including being listed as the 13th favourite book in Britain in a 2003 [[BBC]] survey called the [[Big Read]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Big Read – Top 100 Books&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml |title=The Big Read – Top 100 Books |publisher=BBC |date=2003 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been adapted three times under the same title: for [[Birdsong (radio drama)|radio]] (1997), [[Birdsong (play)|the stage]] (2010) and [[Birdsong (TV miniseries)|television]] (2012).

== Background and publication ==
[[File:Sebastian Faulks -London, England-15Jan2010.jpg|right|thumb|220x220px|Faulks signing the [[The Convention on Modern Liberty]]]]
Faulks wrote the novel partly because he felt that the First World War had not been discussed enough in both literary and historical contexts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2664531/How-I-REAL-story-Birdsong-mud-blood-Flanders-A-powerful-moving-tribute-heroes-WWI-author-one-Britains-cherished-literary-classics.html|title=How I found the REAL story of Birdsong in Flanders' mud and blood|last=Faulks|first=Sebastian|date=21 June 2014|website=|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on the novel twenty years later, Faulks felt that the published version did not fully do justice to the experience of war: it did not provide readers with &quot;a full appreciation of the soldiers' physical experience; and, perhaps more importantly, a philosophical understanding of what it meant to be part of the first genocidal event of the century – the one that made the others imaginable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

Because Faulks felt that much of the extant World War I literature was deeply influenced by World War II literature, he deliberately avoided research with secondary documents, such as historical [[monograph]]s, instead focusing on veteran interviews and period primary sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

The novel was a success, with international impact and attention. The hardback print-run, first issued in 1993, sold 14,000 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sebastian_Faulks_s_Birdsong.html?id=TD3A48XGkGYC |title=Sebastian Faulks's Birdsong |last=Wheeler |first=Pat |date=|publisher=Continuum International Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=0-8264-5323-6 |location=New York |pages=76–79 |chapter=The Novel's Performance}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel featured in many &quot;Best of the Year lists&quot; in the United Kingdom during 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt; Subsequently, the novel has become one of the most checked-out works from British libraries.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;

Though Faulks's fourth published novel in the United Kingdom, ''Birdsong'' was only his second republished in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;  In New Zealand and Australia, the novel was popular, reaching best seller and &quot;what's hot&quot; lists.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt; The novel was also sold in translation in Italy, France, Spain, Latin America, Germany, Portugal, Brazil, Denmark, Poland, Israel, Sweden, Estonia, Japan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Finland and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt; Globally, sales were strong, and as of 2010, the novel had sold over 3 million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/7753363/Sebastian-Faulks-novel-Birdsong-to-be-made-into-West-End-play.html |title=Sebastian Faulks novel Birdsong to be made into West End play |date=2010-05-23|access-date=2016-08-30 |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |author=Nikkhah, Roya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

''Birdsong'' has an episodic structure, and is split into seven sections which move between three different periods of time before, during and after the war in the Stephen Wraysford plot, and three different windows of time in the 1970s Benson plot.

===France 1910===
[[File:INCONNU - AMIENS - La Place Gambetta.JPG|left|thumb|A plaza with trolley in pre-War Amiens.]]
The first stage starts in pre-war [[Amiens]], France. Stephen Wraysford visits and lives with René Azaire, his wife Isabelle and their children. Azaire teaches Stephen about the French textile industry. He witnesses a comfortable middle class life in Northern France alongside industrial worker unrest. Azaire and the significantly younger Isabelle express discontent with their marriage. This sparks Stephen's interest in Isabelle, with whom he soon falls in love. During one incident, Azaire, embarrassed that he and Isabelle cannot have another child, beats her in a jealous rage. Around the same time, Isabelle helps give food to the families of striking workers, stirring rumours that she is having an affair with one of the workers.

Stephen's love of Isabelle transforms into a passionate affair. Isabelle confronts Azaire with the truth of their relationship and Azaire evicts Stephen. Isabelle leaves with him, running away to Southern France. There she becomes pregnant, and momentarily loses faith in her relationship with Stephen. Without telling Stephen, she flees, returning to her family home and the one constant in her life: her sister Jeanne. Later, Isabelle's father makes a deal with Azaire for her return to maintain her honour; Isabelle is forgiven but soon regrets leaving her true love, Stephen. However, she does not reach back out to Stephen.

===France 1916===
[[File:World War I - Vimy sector tunnel.jpg|thumb|upright|A picture of preserved tunnels constructed as part of the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]]. Stephen supports a crew building similar tunnels.]]

The second section rejoins Stephen, when he is a lieutenant in the [[British Army]] at the start of the war. Through his eyes, Faulks tells the reader about the [[first day on the Somme]] in July 1916 and the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] near [[Ypres]] in the following year.

Several episodes depict a downtrodden Stephen whose only respite is his friendship with Captain Michael Weir and his men. Stephen gains the reputation of a cold and distant officer. He refuses all offers of leave, because he is committed  to fighting  the war.

His story is interleaved with that of Jack Firebrace, a former miner employed with the [[tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers]] in the British trenches to listen for the enemy and plant mines under the German trenches. In one expedition across No-Man's Land, Stephen is badly injured but survives.

[[File:The Battle of the Somme, July-november 1916 Q115.jpg|left|thumb|Miners laying charges for one of the [[Mines on the first day of the Somme|mines on the Somme]] in 1916. These men were of a similar company to the characters represented in the novel.]]

During these episodes, Stephen feels lonely and writes to Isabelle, feeling that there is no one else to whom he can express his feelings. He writes about his fears that he will die, and confesses that he has only ever loved her.

===England 1978===
Alongside the main story, there is the narrative of Stephen's granddaughter, Elizabeth, who, whilst struggling with her already married boyfriend, Robert, unearths Stephen's journals from World War I and seeks to learns about his experiences at Marne, Verdun and the Somme. She discovers that Stephen's journals are encoded, but tries to decipher them.

===France 1917===
[[File:Amiens. 1er avril 1916. Goumiers - Fonds Berthelé - 49Fi195.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Mounted soldiers passing through the streets of Amiens in 1916.]]
Stephen has a chance encounter with Jeanne, Isabelle's sister, while on leave in Amiens. During this encounter, Stephen convinces her to allow him to meet with Isabelle. He meets her but finds her face disfigured by a shell with scarring caused from the injury. Stephen discovers that Isabelle is now in a relationship with Max, a German soldier.

Stephen returns to England briefly, and finds relief at being able to enjoy the Norfolk countryside away from the trenches. When he meets Jeanne again on the way back, he tells her how he dreads returning to the front line after leave. Weir, Stephen's closest friend, is eventually killed by a sniper's bullet while in a trench out of the front line.

===England 1978–1979===
Elizabeth continues researching the war and talks to war veterans Gray and Brennan (who knew Stephen) about their experiences. During this period, she also becomes pregnant with Robert's child.

===France 1918===
[[File:Hawthorn Ridge mine 1 July 1916.jpg|thumb|A mine exploding at [[Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt]]. A similar explosion traps Stephen and Firebrace below ground, before being rescued by German miners.]]

The WWI plot ends with Stephen and Firebrace  trapped underground after a German mine explosion; with their way out blocked, they talk and share their experiences, with Firebrace grieving for his dead son John and Stephen telling him of his former love for Isabelle. Stephen finds some explosives and Firebrace, himself close to death, tells him how to lay them in order to blast their way out of the tunnel. Before Stephen completes the task, Firebrace dies. The explosion successfully clears a way out for Stephen, and he is rescued by Levi, a [[Jewish]] German soldier, as the war ends.

===England 1979===
Elizabeth finally decides to reveal her pregnancy to her mother Françoise, who, to Elizabeth's surprise, is supportive. Over dinner, she learns her mother was raised by Stephen and Jeanne, who married and settled in Norfolk after Elizabeth's grandmother Isabelle's premature death due to the [[1918 flu pandemic|postwar influenza epidemic]]. Elizabeth and the still-married Robert go on holiday to [[Dorset]], where she goes into labour and has a son, naming him John (after Jack Firebrace's late son). The book ends with Robert walking down the garden of the holiday cottage and having an immense sense of joy.

== Themes ==

=== Recovering history ===
The novel deals explicitly with the contemporary act of recovering the memory of WWI, and compiling contemporary understanding of those narratives—a function common to works of [[historiographic metafiction]], like [[Pat Barker]]'s [[Regeneration Trilogy]], [[A.S. Byatt]]'s ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]],'' and [[Ian McEwan]]'s ''[[Atonement (novel)|Atonement]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Historical Novel|last=de Groot|first=Jerome|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-42662-6|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=100–104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literary scholar Jerome de Groot calls ''Birdsong'' one of the first novels of its kind, creating a trend in the 1990s of literary fiction rethinking and reflecting on the World Wars and their historical legacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

[[Michael Gorra]], a professor of English literature, argues that Faulks seeks to demonstrate that &quot;the past can be recovered, its code can be broken; it can be used to add meaning to contemporary life. Its limitations can be overcome and its promises fulfilled because we know it can heal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/books/tunnel-vision.html|title=Tunnel Vision|last=Gorra|first=Michael|date=1996-02-11|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberate hiding of Stephen's stories, remaining silent to his family after the war's end and encoding his journals, mirrors the actual loss of record and stories from veterans in post-war Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/13/book-club-birdsong-sebastian-faulks|title=Birdsong by Sebastian Faulks|last=Mullan|first=John|date=2012-07-13|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth's search for that history is a process of recovering that memory in order to gain a greater emotional relationships with her grandfather, to whom she had never felt connected.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sokołowska-Paryż|first=Marzena|date=2015|chapter=Re-imagining the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme in Contemporary British Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KpLWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA92&amp;ots=PypF6A06iD&amp;sig=qddxQE9oxLKZW07uhM1TqE8sboI|title=Re-imagining the First World War: New Perspectives in Anglophone Literature and Culture|editor1=Anna Branach-Kallas|editor2=Nelly Strehlau|location=Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|pages=92–109|isbn=978-1-4438-8338-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', the medical doctor Paul Slade described reading about this investigation of another person's history to illuminate how &quot;superficial&quot; his own [[Medical history|patient histories]] practice had been.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slade|first=Paul|date=1999-01-01|title=Review of A Book That Changed Me: &quot;Birdsong&quot;|jstor=25186653|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=319|issue=7224|pages=1583–1583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorra described the novel's split into parallel narratives as the critical fault in the reading experience of the novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; For de Groot, however, the split structure provides one of the most sophisticated elements of the novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; De Groot writes that Benson's investigation of personal history allows Faulks to examine the difference between the two perspectives on the memory, highlighting the &quot;unknowability of the horror of war&quot; and of history more generally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

=== Trauma ===
[[File:Paths of Glory Art.IWMART518.jpg|thumb|Death surrounded British soldiers on the front line, often to the point of breaking their psychological endurance. Faulks explores this historical trauma, throughout the novel. Painting by [[Christopher R. W. Nevinson|C. R. W. Nevinson]], 1917.]]

Like other novels documenting WWI, the shock and trauma of death is embedded throughout the book's depiction of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/29/guardian-book-club-birdsong-sebastian-faulks |title=Birdsong by Sebastian Faulks |last=Mullan |first=John |date=2012-06-29 |newspaper=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077 |access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Mullen, reviewing the book for ''[[The Guardian]]'', described the depictions of the Battle of the Somme particularly brutal.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; According to scholar Marzena Sokołowska-Paryż, Faulks treats the war as a way to &quot;test human endurance&quot; and explore the effect of carnage on the psyche.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; A reviewer for ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' also highlighted this theme, writing that &quot;the war, here, is Faulks's real subject, his stories of destroyed lives, however wrenching, only throwing its horror into greater relief and making it the more unbearable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sebastian-faulks/birdsong/ |title=Birdsong by Sebastian Faulks |date=December 1, 1995 |website=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary historian Simon Wessley describes the novel, alongside Barker's [[Regeneration (novel)|''Regeneration'']], as an exemplar of contemporary fiction which uses the experience of the World War I trenches to examine more contemporary understandings of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wessely|first=Simon|date=2006 |title=Twentieth-Century Theories on Combat Motivation and Breakdown|jstor=30036386 |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |volume=41|issue=2 |pages=269–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Groot argues that this reinvestigation of a traumatic history mirrors a growing interest among both literary authors and historians in trauma as a thematic subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

The historian Ross J. Wilson noted that this reinvestigation of the traumas of the World Wars revisits and revives the experience of trauma within contemporary culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YcGDAAAQBAJ |title=Cultural Heritage of the Great War in Britain |last=Wilson |first=Ross J.|date=2016-04-22 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, Oxon |isbn=978-1-317-15646-8 |pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faulks uses both different narrators and different narrative perspectives (first, third and omniscient) on the death in the trenches to explore the trauma of death in numerous and challenging ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; For Mullen, this gives the effect of &quot;[t]he novelist painfully manipulat[ing] the reader's emotions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

== Style ==
The novel frequently changes [[Multiperspectivity|narrative perspectives]], using a significant amount of [[interior monologue]], [[direct speech]] and [[dramatic irony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sebastian_Faulks_s_Birdsong.html?id=TD3A48XGkGYC|title=Sebastian Faulks's Birdsong|last=Wheeler|first=Pat|date=|publisher=Continuum International Publishing|year=2002|isbn=0-8264-5323-6|location=New York|pages=23–30|language=en|chapter=Narrative form/Style|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though employing an omniscient narrator who occasionally describes the events from a broad perspective, the novel tends to shadow a handful of characters closely, principally Stephen Wraysford, Isaebelle Azair, Micheal Weir, Jack Firebrace and Elizabeth Benson.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt;

Pat Wheeler, a scholar of literature, describes the narrative style as &quot;both naturalistic and realistic and very much in the manner of the nineteenth century writers [Faulks] cites as literary influences&quot;—Wheeler notes [[Émile Zola]], [[Charles Dickens]] and [[George Gissing]] among these.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt; Wheeler emphasizes that the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] tendencies of the narrative allow treatment of the war setting without an idealization of the &quot;human&quot; parts of the narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt; Consistently, reviews emphasize the novel's imagery of the battle experience in and amongst the trenches.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; For Slade, the novel &quot;produces a vivid and traumatizing description of the sights and sounds of life and death in (and under the trenches)&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; the principal cause of this, he says, is &quot;the pure fury and intensity of the imagery created page after page&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

==Reception==
''Birdsong'' is one of Faulks's best-received works of fiction, both by the public and amongst reviewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7t-oAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=Birdsong+novel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dM28AY0KwW&amp;sig=IpDM_Yhtdm9hzWsjET2cG1W_bE4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH6qjA1PTOAhVBqR4KHdPiAX44FBDoAQg_MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=Birdsong%2520novel&amp;f=false |title=Sebastian Faulks's Birdsong |last=Wheeler |first=Pat |date=2002-06-26 |publisher=Continuum Publishing International |isbn=0-8264-5323-6 |pages=69–74 |chapter=The Novel's Reception}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British press offered considerable praise, with positive reviews from ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'', ''The Guardian'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'', ''[[The Sunday Express]]'', ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Scotsman]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; American and other international press reviews were similarly positive.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

The novel's popular reception was similarly positive. ''Birdsong'' came 13th in a 2003 [[BBC]] survey called the [[Big Read]], which aimed to find Britain's favourite book.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Big Read – Top 100 Books&quot; /&gt; It received an &quot;Also Mentioned&quot; credit in ''[[The Observer]]''{{'s}} 2005 poll of critics and writers to find the &quot;Best British book of the last 25 years&quot; (1980–2005). ''Birdsong'' was listed in ''The Telegraph'' as one of the most consistently high selling books of 1998–2008, continuously in the top 5,000 sales figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2523171/The-12-top-titles-that-booksellers-must-always-stock.html |title=The 12 top titles that booksellers must always stock |newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2010 |first=Stephen |last=Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews of the novel often focus on the fluid reading experience as well as the novel's effective treatment of &quot;'real' people&quot; within the trauma of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; Gorra describes the novel as mostly a strong WWI novel, characterising it as &quot;superb&quot; with prose that is &quot;spare and precise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The review published in ''Kirkus Reviews'' was glowing: &quot;Once more, Faulks shows his unparalleled strengths as a writer of plain human life and high, high compassion. A wonderful book, ringing with truth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

Consistently one of the greatest critiques of the novel concerns its 1970s plot-line.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; For example, Gorra found that the addition of a  parallel narrative &quot;[ran] into problems&quot;—especially concerning Elizabeth Benson, whom he &quot;stopped believing in [as a] character&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Unlike other reviewers, the critic Sarah Belo did not question the historical investigation plot, but the depiction of Elizabeth's experience as a 1970s woman in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; On the other hand, almost all of the reviewers describe the novel's war sections as excellently written; for example, the review in the ''Los Angeles Times'' called the sections &quot;so powerful as to be almost unbearable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

The novel has been favourably compared to other World War I and II novels, including ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[The Young Lions]]'' and ''[[War and Remembrance]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leaning |first=Jennifer |date=2002 |title=Review of La Tendresse |jstor=25452659 |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=325 |issue=7369 |pages=908–908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorra described the novel as even more original than Barker's ''[[The Ghost Road]]'' and the rest of her Regeneration Trilogy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Kate Saunders, reviewing ''Birdsong'' for ''The Sunday Times'', praised the novel and described it as &quot;without the political cynicism that colours more modern treatments of this catastrophe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; Reviewers have also compared the novel to other literary works; for example, for one critic, the lead up to the Somme was as persuasive as the &quot;scene in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' before the Battle of Agincourt&quot;, while the novelist Suzanne Ruta writes that Faulks creates characters with a similar depth to those in [[Thomas Hardy]] novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

==Adaptations==
''Birdsong'' was adapted as a [[Birdsong (radio drama)|radio drama of the same title]] in 1997, and as [[Birdsong (play)|a stage play]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; The play adaptation was first directed by [[Trevor Nunn]] at the [[Harold Pinter Theatre|Comedy Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

In 2012 it was adapted as a [[Birdsong (TV serial)|two-part television drama]] for the BBC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Review of War Horse&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-01-01|title=Review of War Horse|jstor=41480794|journal=History Ireland|volume=20|issue=2|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production starred [[Eddie Redmayne]] as Stephen Wraysford and [[Clémence Poésy]] as Isabelle Azaire, and was directed by [[Philip Martin (director)|Philip Martin]], based on a screenplay by [[Abi Morgan]]. The historian Edward Madigan favourably compared the television adaptation to Stephen Spielburg's [[War Horse (film)|''War Horse'']] as a successful evocation of the experience of the World War I trenches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Review of War Horse&quot;/&gt;

In both 2013 and 2014, Faulks indicated that a feature film adaptation was in development. The screenplay is by [[Rupert Wyatt]], and the film is expected to star [[Nicholas Hoult]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/berlin-nicholas-hoult-joins-birdsong-420015 | newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Stuart | last=Kemp | title=Berlin 2013: Nicholas Hoult Joins Cast of 'Birdsong'|date=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/10859082/Sebastian-Faulks-on-Birdsong-why-TV-adaptations-go-wrong.html|title=Sebastian Faulks on Birdsong: why TV adaptations go wrong|last=Singh|first=Anita|date=24 May 2014|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
