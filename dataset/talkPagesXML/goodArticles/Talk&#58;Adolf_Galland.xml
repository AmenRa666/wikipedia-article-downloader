== Defining &quot;Flying ace&quot;, and whether the Pope is catholic ==

This is to open a discussion on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Galland&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=671777177&amp;oldid=671404391 a recent edit]. I deleted the detail in  the Introduction, and repeated in the Condor Legion section, explaining what a flying ace was. This was reverted, with the explanation “''a lay reader shouldn't necessarily have to go to a linked page to understand a key concept''”.&lt;br/&gt; 
It isn't a big issue, but I'm wondering what is so &quot;key&quot; about this concept that it needs to be included twice here, one of them in only the second sentence of the article. I accept that [[WP:POPE|what is obvious to me isn't necessarily obvious to everyone]], but the (obvious) solution is to include a link, so that anyone who doesn't know what a term means can find out, while those that do can read on without being side-tracked by (what are to them) irrelevancies. It shouldn't be necessary to write out “''...the Pope (the head of the Catholic Church)...''” in every instance, should it, when “''the [[Pope]]...''” will do? But if that is the case, why is it not necessary to explain  &quot;German&quot;, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, &quot;general&quot;, &quot;Second World War&quot;, and &quot;military aviator&quot;, as well? No less key, and no less opaque to some?&lt;br/&gt; 
Second, from a practical point of view, if this information needs to be included here, it is no less the case for every other article on flying aces we have; [[:Category:World War II flying aces|for those from WWII]] that's 485 German, 119 US, 86 British, so far; not to mention [[:Category:World War I flying aces|those from WWI]]. Do we need to trawl through all those articles to add this information?&lt;br/&gt;
Third, being pedantic; defining an ace as five aerial combat victories (another key concept that should be explained, or at least linked) is a French idea, which spread to the British and the Americans In WWI, The German definition then was 10 victories, and in WWII Galland and other high scorers were simply referred to as &quot;experts&quot;, with a complex points system adding up to awards like the Knights Cross. I'm kind of wondering whether the source knew this or (with a name like Uwe Feist, I presume he is German) has simply been misquoted. Anyway, that's my ha'penny-worth, [[User:Xyl 54|Xyl 54]] ([[User talk:Xyl 54|talk]]) 20:36, 17 July 2015 (UTC)
:Hi Xyl. First off, as the guy who reverted your bold edit, thanks for following [[WP:BRD]], which I've always considered a useful concept and which I don't think is employed nearly enough! Actually, I tend to agree with your reasoning and just link [[flying ace]] without further explanation in my British Commonwealth ace articles, but I have seen it spelt out in some German ace articles and wanted to give the main editor(s) of this article a chance to consider and comment (partly also because it's GA and has clearly had some eyes on it). I'm probably also influenced by the practice in many articles on  [[Victoria Cross]] recipients of spelling out in the lead that the VC is &quot;the highest decoration for gallantry 'in the face of the enemy' awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces&quot;, which has been accepted in many GAs/FAs. Anyway, I will be happy with whichever method consensus throws up. Cheers, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) 00:49, 18 July 2015 (UTC)
::Thank you for your comments.
::I hadn't taken in that this had GA status: I'm generally of the opinion that changes to GA/FA pages should be discussed (or at least announced) beforehand, as the potential for disimprovement is that much greater. 
::I'm content to wait for a consensus on this also, as it is likely to affect other pages. I checked some of the other German ace pages; the top three don't have this explanation in the text, but 3 of the first 7 (the 'A's) in [[:Category:German World War II flying aces|their category]] do have it. So there may be some work either way to make them consistent. Regards, [[User:Xyl 54|Xyl 54]] ([[User talk:Xyl 54|talk]]) 20:22, 20 July 2015 (UTC)
:::The inclusion of this wording was a request by another editor at either A-class or FA-Class. I don't recall which article it was. The reasoning was &quot;don't make me click&quot; to figure out why this person is notable. This wording since then was worked into a number of articles. [[User:MisterBee1966|MisterBee1966]] ([[User talk:MisterBee1966|talk]]) 04:58, 21 July 2015 (UTC)
::::Trouble is, that doesn't really solve the problem.
::::Galland is notable because he was a ''Luftwaffe'' &quot;expert&quot; with 104 aerial victories, not because he was an ace with 5 or more, and because he held the Knight's Cross. If the rationale is to avoid readers having to click on links to find out what things are, then those are probably more important terms to explain. 
::::In an article which is [[WP:SIZERULE|already 109 Kb]] explaining what an ace is just seems like padding. [[User:Xyl 54|Xyl 54]] ([[User talk:Xyl 54|talk]]) 22:08, 23 July 2015 (UTC)
:::::I think the last is a fair point. OTOH, just as a general observation, Galland is indeed notable for much more than simply being an ace, but in WP terms he would still be notable if he ''was'' only an ace.
