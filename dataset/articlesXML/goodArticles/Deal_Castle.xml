'''Deal Castle''' is an artillery fort constructed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], [[Kent]], between 1539 and 1540. It formed part of the King's [[Device Fort|Device programme]] to protect against invasion from France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and defended the strategically important [[the Downs|Downs anchorage]] off the English coast. Comprising a [[keep]] with six inner and outer [[bastions]], the [[moat]]ed stone castle covered {{convert|0.85|acre}} and had sixty-six firing positions for [[List of medieval and early modern gunpowder artillery|artillery]]. It cost [[the Crown]] a total of £27,092 to build the three castles of Deal, [[Sandown Castle, Kent|Sandown]], and [[Walmer Castle|Walmer]], which lay adjacent to one another along the coast and were connected by earthwork defences.{{efn|name=Money16thC}} The original invasion threat passed but, during the [[Second English Civil War]] of 1648–49, Deal was seized by pro-[[Cavalier|Royalist]] insurgents and was only retaken by [[Roundheads|Parliamentary forces]] after several months' fighting.

Although it remained armed, Deal was adapted by Sir [[John Norris (Royal Navy officer)|John Norris]] and [[Robert Smith, 1st Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] during the 18th and 19th centuries to form a more suitable private house for the castle's captain, which was by now an honorary position. In 1904, the [[War Office]] concluded that the castle no longer had any value either as a defensive site or as a [[barracks]], and it was opened to the public when the captain was not in residence. Early in the [[Second World War]], the captain's quarters were destroyed by [[Battle of Britain|German bombing]], forcing Deal's captain, [[William Birdwood]], to move to [[Hampton Court Palace]], and the castle became an [[observation post]] for an [[artillery battery]] placed along the shore line. The castle was not brought back into use as a residence and was restored by the government during the 1950s to form a tourist attraction. In the 21st century, Deal Castle is operated by [[English Heritage]], receiving 25,256 visitors in 2008.

==History==

===16th century===

====Background====
[[File:Deal Castle 1539 draft.jpg|thumb|upright|Draft 1539 plan probably shown to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=26}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/henryviii/militmap/hencastle/|title=Design for Henrician castle on the Kent coast|publisher=British Library|mode=cs2|access-date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Deal Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the final years of the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Traditionally [[the Crown]] had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a limited role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1987|p=111}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modest defences, based around simple [[blockhouse]]s and towers, existed in the south-west and along the [[Sussex]] coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1991|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1533, Henry broke with Pope [[Paul III]] so as to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], and remarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was the aunt of [[Charles V of Spain|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; An invasion of England appeared certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;[[Device Fort|device]]&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Walton|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Construction====
Deal and the adjacent castles of [[Walmer Castle|Walmer]] and [[Sandown Castle, Kent|Sandown]] were constructed to protect [[the Downs]] in east Kent, an important anchorage formed by the [[Goodwin Sands]] which gave access to [[Deal, Kent|Deal Beach]], on which enemy soldiers could easily be landed and an area the King knew well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1991|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone castles were supported by a line of four earthwork forts, known as the Great Turf, the Little Turf Bulwark, the Great White Bulwark of Clay and the Walmer Bulwark, and a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=mid|-long|1}} defensive ditch and bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively the castles became known as the &quot;castles of the Downs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money16thC|Comparing early modern costs and prices with those of the modern period is challenging. £27,092 in 1539 could be equivalent to between £15.3 million and £6,960 million in 2014, depending on the price comparison used. For comparison, the total royal expenditure on all the Device Forts across England between 1539 and 1547 came to £376,500, with [[St Mawes Castle|St Mawes]], for example, costing £5,018, and [[Sandgate Castle|Sandgate]] £5,584. £396 in 1616 could be equivalent to between £1 million and £21 million; £1,243 in 1634 to between £3 million and £52 million. £500 in 1648 could equate to between £1 million and £17 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biddle|Hiller|Scott|Streeten|2001|p=12}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ | title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1270 to Present| author1 = Lawrence H.

[[File:Deal Castle (1).jpg|thumb|left|The castle from the east, showing the outer bastions, inner bastions, keep and lantern]]
It is not known who designed Deal Castle, but Sir Edward Ryngeley and Thomas Wingfield served as the commissioners for the project, with Robert Loyrde and David Marten as the [[paymaster]] and [[comptroller]], and Christopher Dickenson and William Clement as the master mason and carpenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colvin|Ransome|Summerson|1982|p=455}}; {{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work began at Deal in April and progressed at speed, with 1,400 men at work on the site by the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colvin|Ransome|Summerson|1982|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strike for higher pay was broken up over the summer by Ryngeley and by December, when [[Anne of Cleves]] dined there, the castle was mostly completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=22–23}}; {{harvnb|Colvin|Ransome|Summerson|1982|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deal and the other fortifications along the Downs cost [[the Crown]] a total of £27,092 to build, much of which came from proceeds of the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] a few years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Colvin|Ransome|Summerson|1982|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money16thC}} Lead, timber and stone from local monasteries were also recycled for use in Deal Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colvin|Ransome|Summerson|1982|p=457}}; {{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wingfield became the first captain of the castle in 1540, supported by a lieutenant and overseeing a garrison of eight soldiers, sixteen gunners and two porters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=77}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported to the [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original invasion threat passed, but the castle was reinforced in 1558, due to fresh concerns of a French attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1570, the main bastions were filled with earth, probably to allow heavier guns to be mounted on them, and Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] inspected the castle in 1573.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defences along the coast were mobilised in 1588 in response to the threat posed by the [[Spanish armada]], and were probably kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=28–29}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1894|pp=78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Deal Castle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|The castle, depicted by [[Wenceslas Hollar]] in the mid-17th century]]
In the early 1600s, England was at peace with France and Spain, and coastal defences received little attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=49}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deal Castle was in a poor state of repair by 1615, the outer walls damaged by storms and [[coastal erosion]], and a 1616 survey suggested that repairs estimated at £396 were necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money16thC}} The problems persisted, with the winter storms filling the moat with water and stones from the beach, and undermining the foundations; the castle's captain, William Byng, sent numerous complaints about this to his superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=83}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/byng-william-1586-1669|title=Byng, William (1586-by 1669), of Wrotham, Kent; later of Deal Castle, Kent|year=2010|publisher=The History of Parliament|mode=cs2|access-date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1634, surveys were suggesting that the repairs would now cost £1,243; a suggestion was put forward by the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]], the [[Duke of Buckingham]], that nearby Camber Castle should be demolished to help provide materiel for the work at Deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money16thC}} Most of the garrison were now living in the town of Deal and complaints were made by the Lord Warden in 1618 that only a small guard force was being left to secure the castle at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=29–30}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the condition of the castle waned, fighting between Dutch, French and Spanish ships in the Downs became common.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some repairs were probably finally carried out in the late 1630s.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neill 1985 7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deal Castle was seized by [[Roundheads|Parliamentary forces]] at the start of the first [[English Civil War]] between the supporters of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[Parliament]], resulting in the dismissal of Byng as a suspected Royalist, and his replacement by Colonel Rainsborough, a vice-admiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/byng-william-1586-1669|title=Byng, William (1586-by 1669), of Wrotham, Kent; later of Deal Castle, Kent|year=2010|publisher=The History of Parliament|mode=cs2|access-date=25 June 2016}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle did not play a significant role in the remainder of the initial conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the few years of unsteady peace after 1645, the [[Second English Civil War|Second Civil War]] broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by their Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Walmer and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was under way across Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Kennedy|1962|pp=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice-Admiral [[William Batten]] had been forced to resign from his post as Commander of the Fleet the previous year by Parliamentary officials, and he now encouraged the fleet to join the Royalist faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1962|pp=248–250}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Henry Palmer, a former sailor, accompanied by other members of the Kentish gentry, also called on the fleet to revolt, taking advantage of the many fellow Kentish men in the crews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashton|1994|p=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walmer and Deal Castle declared for the King, shortly after the garrisons at Sandown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1962|pp=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainsborough was removed from his post as captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast or aid sent to the Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashton|1994|pp=439–440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deal Castle 04.jpg|thumb|left|The east side of the castle, showing the moat and the sequence of gun-ports at ground level]]
Parliament defeated the wider insurgency at the [[Battle of Maidstone]] at the start of June, and then sent a force under the command of Colonel [[Nathaniel Rich (soldier)|Nathaniel Rich]] to deal with Deal and the other castles along the Downs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashton|1994|p=440}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged, and surrendered on 12 July.&lt;ref name=HarringtonP51&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deal, which had been resupplied by the Royalists from the sea, was besieged in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Ashton|1994|p=442}}; {{harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Royalist fleet bombarded the Parliamentary positions and temporarily landed a force 1,500 Flemish mercenaries in support of the revolt, but a shortage of money forced their return to the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garrison then carried out a surprise attack on their besiegers but were fought back with some losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neill 1985 7&quot;/&gt; The fleet, under the command of Prince [[Charles II of England|Charles]], attempted to land a fresh force in August, but despite three attempts the operation failed and suffered heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After news arrived of the Royalist [[Battle of Preston (1648)|defeat at Preston]], Deal surrendered on 20 August, and artillery assaults then began on Sandown, leading to the surrender of the remaining fortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Ashton|1994|p=442}}; {{harvnb|O'Neill|1985|pp=9–10}}; {{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The castle had been badly damaged during the conflict&amp;nbsp;— Colonel Rich reported it to be &quot;much torn and spoiled with the granades&quot;&amp;nbsp;– and it was estimated by Rich, responsible for carrying out the repairs, that work would cost at least £500.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=10}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money16thC}} A governor, Samuel Taverner, was appointed, supported by a corporal and twenty soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars#First war (1652–1654)|Dutch threat]], Deal Castle was maintained and kept equipped with powder, and was reinforced with earthworks and soldiers at the start of the First Dutch War in 1652.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1894|pp=118, 131}}; {{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=32}}; {{harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles II was [[English Restoration|restored to the throne]] in 1660 and reduced both the size and the wages of the garrison, but the castle continued to play an important role in defending the Downs during the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars#Second war (1665–1667)|Second]] and [[Anglo-Dutch Wars#Third war (1672–1674)|Third Dutch Wars]], supported by local trained bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1894|pp=123–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byng attempted to reclaim his former captainship under the new regime, and may have been briefly reappointed in early 1660.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/byng-william-1586-1669|title=Byng, William (1586-by 1669), of Wrotham, Kent; later of Deal Castle, Kent|year=2010|publisher=The History of Parliament|mode=cs2|access-date=25 June 2016}}; {{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Glorious Revolution|revolution]] against [[James II of England|James II]] in December 1688, the townsfolk of Deal seized the castle in support of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], and took steps to defend the Downs against a feared Irish invasion which never materialised.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=126}}; {{harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deal Castle continued to be used as a military fortification throughout the 18th century, and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 [[culverin]] guns.&lt;ref name=CoadPP3233&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, however, the captain, naval officer Sir [[John Norris (Royal Navy officer)|John Norris]], redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=32–33}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20278?docPos=3|title=Norris, Sir John (1670/71–1749)|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=J. K. Laughton|date=2008|edition=online|mode=cs2|access-date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar work had been carried out at Walmer in 1708 by the [[Duke of Dorset]], [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset|Lionel Sackville]], and there may have been some competition between the two men.&lt;ref name=CoadPP3233/&gt; The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements, and wood-panelled accommodation at the rear overlooking the sea; the porter's lodge was also updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the castle was armed with nine 36-pounder guns, supported by further artillery batteries placed along the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; To protect Deal, units of infantry and cavalry, called [[fencibles]], were formed in 1794 by [[William Pitt the Younger]]&amp;nbsp;– then both the [[Prime Minister]] and the [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]]&amp;nbsp;– and in 1802 units of [[bombardier (rank)|bombardier]]s recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|pp=246, 248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The politician and banker [[Robert Smith, 1st Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] carried out improvements to the castle in 1802, apparently as a rival project to his friend Pitt's work at Walmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1890|pp=252–253}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25892?docPos=7|title=Smith, Robert, first Baron Carrington (1752–1838)|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=A.

Pollard|date=2009|edition=online|mode=cs2|access-date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Samuel Wilberforce]], Carrington had hoped to charge the cost of the work to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], but when he attempted to submit the claims, they were rejected by Pitt and he had to pay for the improvements himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1890|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deal Castle was increasingly resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and this led to arguments in 1829 as to whether it should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1890|pp=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, the [[War Office]] agreed that the [[Office of Works]] should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle, and that the Office of Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work.&lt;ref name=Fry2014P11&gt;{{harvnb|Fry|2014|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to the Office of Works.&lt;ref name=Fry2014P11/&gt; When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the [[Second World War]], a German bomber destroyed much of the captain's quarters, forcing the incumbent, [[William Birdwood]], to move to [[Hampton Court Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Parker|2005|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two 6-inch naval guns were mounted in front of the castle between 1940 and 1944, manned by 337 Battery of 563 Coast Regiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;pastscape1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1417140|title=Deal Emergency Coastal Battery|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle operated as a [[Observation post|Battery Operating Post]]&amp;nbsp;– one of the first-floor rooms in the keep became the Battery Office&amp;nbsp;— and provided accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=15}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1417140|title=Deal Emergency Coastal Battery|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, the castle officially ceased to function as a residence and was passed to the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works.&lt;ref name=&quot;pastscape1&quot;/&gt; Restoration work was carried out during the 1950s, largely removing the remaining 18th-century modifications on the seaward side of the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=34}}; {{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1956/may/01/deal-castle|title=Deal Castle|publisher=Hansard|date=1 May 1956|mode=cs2|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Deal Castle is operated by [[English Heritage]] as a tourist attraction, receiving 25,256 visitors in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/88439/CASE_Tourism_Data.xls|title=CASE Tourism Data|publisher=UK Government|mode=cs2|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is protected under UK law as a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historicengland1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1013380|title=Artillery Castle at Deal|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Deal Castle plan labelled.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Ground floor plan: A&amp;nbsp;– moat; B&amp;nbsp;– gatehouse; C&amp;nbsp;– inner courtyard; D&amp;nbsp;– keep]]
Deal Castle retains most of its original 16th-century structure, including a tall [[keep]] with six semi-circular [[bastion]]s, {{convert|86|ft}} across, at the centre, flanked by a further six rounded bastions, the western of which served as a [[gatehouse]], surrounded by a [[moat]] and a [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Rutton|1898|pp=26–27}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle's bastion walls are {{convert|15|feet|m}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed using [[Kentish ragstone]] from near [[Maidstone]], locally made bricks, and [[Caen stone]] recycled from local monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=6, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was larger than its sister castles at Walmer and Sandown, measuring approximately {{convert|234|by|216|ft}} across and covering {{convert|0.85|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutton|1898|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The castle originally had four tiers of [[List of medieval and early modern gunpowder artillery|artillery]]&amp;nbsp;– the heaviest and longest-range weapons occupying the upper levels, including the keep&amp;nbsp;– with a total of 66 firing positions, and another 53 [[gunloop]]s in the basement for [[handgun]]s, should close defence be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[embrasure]]s in the walls were all widely splayed to provide the maximum possible space for the guns to operate and traverse, and the interior of the castle was designed with vents to allow the smoke from its guns to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battlements on the modern castle are in a faux [[medieval architecture|medieval]], rather than [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]], style and date from  1732.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicengland1&quot;/&gt;

The historian [[John Rigby Hale|John Hale]] considered the original castle to form a transitional design between older medieval English designs and the [[Star fort|newer Italian style]]s of defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of Deal, like its sister castles along the Downs, suffered from design problems: it needed too many guns to ever be fully equipped; its curved surfaces were vulnerable to attack; and despite attempts to keep the walls low and thick, its relatively high profile, driven by the requirement to support several tiers of defences, made it exposed to attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowry|2006|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|pp=43-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deal Castle is entered through the gatehouse, which originally overlooked a walled garden, since largely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dry, stone-lined moat, {{convert|20|m}} wide and {{convert|5|m}} deep, would originally have been crossed over a stone [[causeway]] and a [[drawbridge]], the latter now replaced by a modern wooden bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=4–5}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1013380|title=Artillery Castle at Deal|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gatehouse still has its original iron-studded doors — the historian Jonathan Coad considers them &quot;among the best preserved for their date&quot; – and five [[murder-holes]] to enable the garrison to defend the internal passageway with missiles or handguns; it would originally have also been protected by a portcullis at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer bastions were filled with earth in the 1570s, and have 18th-century ramparts; the superstructure around the eastern bastion was rebuilt after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passageway called &quot;the Rounds&quot; runs along the outside of the outer bastions, linking the handgun positions covering the base of the moat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The keep has a central [[newel]] staircase, linking the basement, ground and first floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=10}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1013380|title=Artillery Castle at Deal|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When first built, the garrison would have lived on the ground floor of the keep, the first floor being used by the captain, and the basement for stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground floor is subdivided by radial walls and originally would have been further subdivided by partitions; the original ovens and fireplace survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=12}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1013380|title=Artillery Castle at Deal|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first floor mainly dates from the 1720s, although some Tudor elements remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wooden [[Roof lantern|lantern]] structure on the top of the keep that contains a bell dating from 1655 and early 18th-century graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keep's gun embrasures were converted to form [[sash window]]s in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|2000|p=9}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1013380|title=Artillery Castle at Deal|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
