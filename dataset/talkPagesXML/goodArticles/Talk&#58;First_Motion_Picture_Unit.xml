== James Stewart ==
Any proof [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]] was in the FMPU? His bio says he was in a regular Army unit and IMDB has no credits for him during the war. --[[User:Jamoche|Jamoche]] 18:34, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

The article does not claim that Stewart was assigned to the 1st Motion Picture Unit, it merely states he is connected with a film the unit made. [[User:Lineagegeek|Lineagegeek]] ([[User talk:Lineagegeek|talk]]) 19:48, 26 May 2012 (UTC)

==Image on infobox==
The image of Stewart &amp; Gable was taken in England when we can presume thet had been transferred ''out of the FMPU'' and into combat duty. There is a sleeve patch for the 18th Army Air Force [http://www.manions.com/priceguide/realize1.aspx~id~6020154], but no indication that the Base Unit wore it. Note that we do not have that insignia on commons. That said, several photos here [http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/World-War-II-The-Movie.html?onsite_source=airspacemag.com&amp;onsite_medium=internal&amp;onsite_campaign=photogalleries&amp;onsite_content=World_War_II:_The_Movie#] show personnel wearing the Hop Arnold insignia on their sleeves. I think the Hap Arnold is the best image for the infobox. &amp;ndash; [[user:Lionelt|Lionel]] &lt;sup&gt;([[user talk:Lionelt|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 02:14, 25 May 2012 (UTC)

Please note that there is not nor has there ever been an &quot;18th Army Air Force&quot;  The patch shown is claimed for the Eighteenth Air Force.  This Numbered Air Force was formed in 1951 after the USAF no longer wore Shoulder Sleeve Insignia and had an emblem approved shortly after it was organized [http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=11034 AFHRA Factsheet, Eighteenth Air Force] (accessed 26 May 2012).  I regard the authenticity of this insignia with strong suspicion.  Also, despite the similarity in name, there is no relationship between Eighteenth Air Force and the 18th AAF Base Unit. [[User:Lineagegeek|Lineagegeek]] ([[User talk:Lineagegeek|talk]]) 19:48, 26 May 2012 (UTC)

What Lionelt refers to as the &quot;Hap Arnold insignia&quot; is the approved Shoulder Sleeve Insigne for the [[Army Air Forces]] and was worn by all AAF personnel who were not assigned to establishments with their own SSIs (such as Numbered Air Forces) it was worn by literally millions of folks during WW II and is by no means unique to the 1st Motion Picture Unit. [[User:Lineagegeek|Lineagegeek]] ([[User talk:Lineagegeek|talk]]) 20:00, 26 May 2012 (UTC)
:Thanks for the clarification. Question: to what does the official designation of FMPU, &quot;18th Army Air Force Base Unit&quot;, refer?  Were there 17 other &quot;Base Units&quot;? Or were they the Base Unit for the &quot;18th Army Air Force&quot;? And was a Base Unit similar to a station? &amp;ndash; [[user:Lionelt|Lionel]] &lt;sup&gt;([[user talk:Lionelt|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 01:44, 27 May 2012 (UTC)

There were literally thousands of AAF Base Units.  They were created in the US in 1944 to free up manpower for overseas assignment.  Essentially, all units in the US that were not programmed to move overseas were disbanded and replaced by bulk authorizations of manpower to the various commands to form units as needed.  These were AAF Base Units (the same thing occurred with [[Army Serice Forces]].  To prevent duplication, blocks of numbers were allotted to the various commands.  The numbers 1-100 were reserved for units like the 1st MPU that reported directly to Hq, AAF and some of their constituent units.  I'm away from my reference books right now, but essentially what happened in the spring of 1944 was the 1st MPU was disbanded and all of its personnel and equipment transferred to the 18th AAF Base Unit, which was parenthetically (1st Motion Picture Unit).  When I'm back home, I'll probably add a footnote to the article. [[User:Lineagegeek|Lineagegeek]] ([[User talk:Lineagegeek|talk]]) 21:52, 27 May 2012 (UTC)
