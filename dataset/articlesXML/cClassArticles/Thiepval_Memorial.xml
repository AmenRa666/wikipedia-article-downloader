The '''Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme''' is a war memorial to 72,246&lt;ref name=CWGC&gt;{{cite web|title=Thiepval Memorial|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/80800/THIEPVAL%20MEMORIAL|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[missing in action|missing]] [[British Empire]] servicemen who died in the [[Battle of the Somme|Battles of the Somme]] of the [[World War I|First World War]] between 1915 and 1918, with no known grave. It is near the village of [[Thiepval]], [[Picardy]] in France. A visitors' centre opened in 2004. &lt;ref name=Stamp165&gt;{{Harvnb|Stamp|2006|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]], Thiepval has been described as; &quot;the greatest executed British work of monumental architecture of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stamp185&gt;{{Harvnb|Stamp|2006|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The Memorial was built approximately {{convert|200|m|yd}} to the south-east of the former [[Thiepval Château]], which was located on lower ground, by the side of Thiepval Wood. The grounds of the original château were not chosen as this would have required the moving of graves, dug during the war around the numerous medical aid stations.

==Design and inauguration==
Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the memorial was built between 1928 and 1932 and is the largest Commonwealth Memorial to the Missing in the world. It was inaugurated (started) by the [[Prince of Wales]] (later [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]]) in the presence of [[Albert Lebrun]], [[President of France]], on 1 August 1932.&lt;ref name=CWGC/&gt; The unveiling ceremony was attended by Lutyens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stamp|2006|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial dominates the rural scene and has 16 brick [[pier (architecture)|piers]], faced with [[Portland stone]]. It was originally built using French bricks from [[Lille]], but was refaced in 1973 with [[Accrington brick]].&lt;ref name=Stamp165/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stamp|2006|pp=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main arch is aligned east to west.&lt;ref name=Stamp130&gt;{{Harvnb|Stamp|2006|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial is {{convert|140|ft}} high, above the level of its podium, which to the west is {{convert|20|ft}} above the level of the adjoining cemetery.&lt;ref name=Stamp130/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stamp|2006|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has foundations {{convert|19|ft}} thick, which were required because of extensive wartime tunnelling beneath the structure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

It is a complex form of [[memorial arch]], comprising interlocking [[arch]]es of four sizes. Each side of the main arch is pierced by a smaller arch, orientated at a [[right angle]] to the main arch. Each side of each of these smaller arches is then pierced by a still smaller arch and so on.&lt;ref name=Gradidge79&gt;{{Harvnb|Gradidge|1981|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]] of each smaller arch is at the level of the [[springer (architecture)|spring]] of the larger arch that it pierces; each of these levels is marked by a stone [[cornice]].&lt;ref name=Skelton139&gt;{{Harvnb|Skelton|Gliddon|2008|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design results in 16 piers, having 64 stone-panelled sides.&lt;ref name=Gradidge79/&gt; Only 48 of these are inscribed, as the panels around the outside of the memorial are blank.&lt;ref name=Stamp146&gt;{{Harvnb|Stamp|2006|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More succinctly, according to the architectural historian Stephen Games, the memorial is composed of two intersecting triumphal arches, each with a larger central arch and two smaller subsidiary arches, the arches on the east-west facades being taller than those on the north-south, and all raised up from what is loosely a square four-by-four tartan grid plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Games 1986 p&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Games|1986|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main arch is surmounted by a tower.&lt;ref name=Gradidge79/&gt; In the central space of the memorial a [[Stone of Remembrance]] rests on a three-stepped platform.&lt;ref name=Skelton139/&gt;

The memorial represents the names 72,246 officers and men (see below),&lt;ref name=CWGC/&gt; and Lutyens's ingenious geometry arises out of the attempt to display these names in compact form, rather than in the longer, lower and linear form taken by other memorials to the missing of the war, such as those at [[Loos Memorial|Loos]], [[Pozières Memorial|Pozières]] and [[Arras Memorial|Arras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Games 1986 p&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery.aspx?cpage=1&amp;sort=totalcasualties&amp;order=asc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Thiepval names.jpeg|thumb|upright|Some of the names of the missing]] --&gt;
The inscription of names on the memorial is reserved for those missing, or unidentified, soldiers who have no known grave. A large inscription on an internal surface of the memorial reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here are recorded 
names of officers 
and men of the 
British Armies who fell 
on the Somme battlefields 
July 1915 February 1918 
but to whom 
the fortune of war 
denied the known 
and honoured burial 
given to their 
comrades in death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the [[Portland stone]] piers are engraved the names of over 72,000 men who were lost in the Somme battles between July 1915 and March 1918. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission states that over 90% of these soldiers died in the first Battle of the Somme between 1 July and 18 November 1916.&lt;ref name=CWGC/&gt; The names are carved using the standard upper-case lettering designed for the Commission by [[MacDonald Gill]].&lt;ref name=Stamp146/&gt;

Over the years since its inauguration, bodies have been regularly discovered on the former battlefield and are sometimes identified through various means.  The decision was taken that to protect the integrity of the memorial as one solely for those who are missing or unidentified, that if a body were found and identified the inscription of their name would be removed from the memorial by filling in the inscription with cement.  For those who are found and identified, they are given a funeral with full military honours at a cemetery close to the location at which they were discovered. This practice has resulted in numerous gaps in the lists of names.

On the top of the archway, a French inscription reads: ''Aux armées Française et Britannique l'Empire Britannique reconnaissant'' (To the French and British Armies, from the grateful British Empire). Just below this, are carved the years 1914 and 1918. On the upper edges of the side archways, split across left and right, is carved the phrase &quot;The Missing ... of the Somme&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stamp|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 8.JPG|thumb|The 'Somme 1916' roundel]]
Also included on this memorial are sixteen stone laurel wreaths, inscribed with the names of sub-battles that made up the Battle of the Somme and subsequent actions in which the men commemorated at Thiepval fell. One is simply titled 'Somme 1916'. Thirteen battles so-named on the other roundels are [[Battle of the Ancre Heights|Ancre Heights]], [[Battle of the Ancre|Ancre]], [[Battle of Albert (1916)|Albert]], [[High Wood]], [[Battle of Delville Wood|Delville Wood]], [[Battle of Morval|Morval]], [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette|Flers–Courcelette]], [[Battle of Pozières|Pozières Wood]], [[Battle of Bazentin Ridge|Bazentin Ridge]], [[Battle of Thiepval Ridge|Thiepval Ridge]], [[Battle of Transloy Ridges|Transloy Ridges]], [[Battle of Ginchy|Ginchy]], and [[Battle of Guillemont|Guillemont]]. The final two roundels are for 'Bapaume' and 'Miraumont', most likely referring to battles or actions in the Somme frontline in 1917 as the Thiepval Memorial includes the missing dead that fell before 20 March 1918. The Actions of Miraumont took place from 17–18 February 1917, and Bapaume was occupied by the British on 17 March 1917 (see [[Operations on the Ancre, January–March 1917]]).

==Anglo-French memorial==
[[File:Thiepval Anglo-French Cemetery 15a.jpg|thumb|Cross of Sacrifice and British (left) and French (right) graves by the memorial]]
The Thiepval Memorial also serves as an Anglo-French battle memorial to commemorate the joint nature of the 1916 offensive.&lt;ref name=CWGC/&gt; In further recognition of this, a cemetery, Thiepval Anglo-French Cemetery, containing 300 [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and 300 French graves lies at the foot of the memorial. Most of the soldiers buried here - 239 of the British Commonwealth and 253 of the French - are unknown, the bodies having been reburied here after discovery between December 1931 and March 1932, mostly from the Somme battlefields but some from as far north as [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]] and as far south as [[Le Quesnel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/67300/THIEPVAL%20ANGLO-FRENCH%20CEMETERY] CWGC Cemetery Record, Thiepval Anglo-French Cemetery.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Commonwealth graves have rectangular headstones made of white stone, while the French graves have grey stone crosses. On the British headstones is the inscription &quot;A Soldier of the Great War/ Known unto God&quot;. The French crosses bear the single word ''&quot;Inconnu&quot;'' ('unknown'). The cemetery's [[Cross of Sacrifice]] bears an inscription that acknowledges the joint British and French contributions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stamp|2006|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|That the world may remember the common sacrifice of two and a half million dead, here have been laid side by side Soldiers of France and of the British Empire in eternal comradeship.|4=Thiepval Anglo-French Cemetery Cross of Sacrifice inscription}}

==Ceremonies and services==
Each year on 1 July (the anniversary of the [[first day on the Somme]]) a major ceremony is held at the memorial.&lt;ref name=CWGC/&gt; There is also a ceremony on the [[Remembrance Day|11 November]], beginning at 1045 [[Central European Time|CET]].
