== Polish-born ==
Suggest changing Polish to Polish-born, as the article provides no clues why he was an ethnic Pole, except being born in Poland. Not to mention non-Polish name and surname. Is it because sources say he was Polish? [[User:Brandmeister|Brandmeister]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Brandmeister|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;   08:39, 27 September 2015 (UTC)
:There was no such place as &quot;Poland&quot; in this period—Polish was an ethnicity spread across multiple countries, not a nationality. If you're going by place of birth, he was Prussian-born, but that will make readers assume he was German which he wasn't. (An independent Polish state had to wait until 1918, unless you count the [[Free City of Kraków]].) Every source refers to him as &quot;Polish&quot; or &quot;a Pole&quot;. Domery was illiterate; the apparently non-Polish name (and non-existent birthplace) is owing to the fact that every record of him derives from records of the English and French militaries, who would have transcribed the name phonetically rather than attempting to guess the Polish or German spelling. (This is crossing the line into OR, but there's also a high chance he gave false details, in an effort to avoid punishment as a deserter should the British return him to Prussia.)&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8209;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Iridescent|iridescent]] 09:47, 27 September 2015 (UTC)
:I share serious concerns about him being Polish. The name &quot;Charles Domery&quot; is totally anglicized. Alt name &quot;Charles Domerz&quot; has a slightly more Polish-sounding surname but this is unreferenced. His place of birth is [[Benche]], at best, a mispelled location. The entire claim of his nationality seems to be based on an early 19th source, whose reliability is dubious. It would be good to see relevant quotations so we can discuss this further. As he was born around 1778, this was after the [[First Partition of Poland]], but he enlisted in the Prussian Army by 1792, so before the [[Second Partition of Poland]]. Perhaps he was born in the [[Prussian partition]], then, which would made the Polish-born phrase problematic ({{ping|Brandmeister}}). But honestly, without so much as a correct place of birth, I see nothing significant tying him to Poland. He seems to me more properly described as a German soldier, perhaps from a family with Polish origins. Finally, the lead (and the FA main page) uses the phrase &quot;a Polish soldier&quot; and that suggests someone serving in the Polish Army, which is clearly not the case here. PS. [[User:iridescent]], you say that &quot;Every source refers to him as &quot;Polish&quot; or &quot;a Pole&quot;&quot;, but I don't see any citations for his nationality in the article. Can you provide quotations and proper citations for such claims? --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 08:30, 12 October 2015 (UTC)

:::Not a bad speculation, through OR would make even a footnote difficult here, I think. Also, Beche sounds French, and taking that into account, French pronouciation rendered in Polish would be not cz but sz so something like [[Besze]]. --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 08:36, 12 October 2015 (UTC)
::::Of course it's speculation; I wasn't suggesting putting in the article without sources. But maybe someone who wants to investigate further will search in the Bęczno archives someday and find a reference to a Karel or Karl Domerz. I can't find any Polish towns with names starting ''Bęsz-'' and anyway, ''Bęcz-'' could easily be frenchified as ''Benche'' too, as ''Bentche'' looks very un-French. Another, perhaps even more phonetically plausible option is [[Bąsze]], then in East Prussia. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 08:42, 12 October 2015 (UTC)

::::::{{Rto|Iridescent}} The discussion seems to be split between two sections now. I would suggest a footnote following the adjective Polish in the lead, to the essence of &quot;most sources attribute him the Polish nationality, through his name (and that of his birthplace) are almost certainly improperly anglicized. It is also highly likely that while he might have indeed been of Polish ethnicity, he was born under Prussian administration, in the Polish lands recently annexed by Prussia under First Partition of Poland, and as such was not a Polish, but a Prussian citizen.&quot; I will also repeat my concern about the phrase &quot;Polish solider&quot; which implies a connection to Polish Army. I'd therefore also recommend appending a phrase that he served in Prussian and French armies immediately following the nationality claim, ex. &quot;also known as Charles Domerz, was a Polish soldier serving in the Prussian and French armies, noted for his unusually large appetite&quot;. --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 12:55, 12 October 2015 (UTC)

::::::Actually, a statistically more likely origin is the city of [[Będzin]], which is a Polish city that was part of Prussia at the time. Inhabitants (like my father, who was born and grew up there) pronounce the city's name with a strong stress on the first syllable (&quot;ˈbɛnd͡ʑ&quot;) and so the second syllable (&quot;in&quot;) could easily have been mis-transliterated as a [[schwa]]. And I say more likely because of the fact that Będzin is a city, while every other place listed above is a village or even smaller, a &quot;settlement,&quot; with just a handful of residents. By contrast, at the end of the 18th century Będzin had 1,200 inhabitants, according to [https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Będzin the Polish WP article].  So there were more people there than all of the other places suggested above combined.

:::::Piotrus, the current wording, which gives the (obviously incorrect) place of birth along with an explanatory footnote ({{tq|His birthplace is given as &quot;Benche&quot; in all sources, but no town of that name exists in Poland, and it may be a misspelling in an early report which has been perpetuated}}) is based on a suggestion from, er, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AIridescent&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=369896818&amp;oldid=369745202 you] (my original query to you is [[User_talk:Piotrus/Archive_33#Periphery_countries_again.E2.80.A6|here]], if anyone reading wants both halves of the conversation). Per my comments at the time, I strongly suspect his name is a French transcription of some variant on &quot;Karol Damir&quot;, and that Dickens's &quot;Domerz&quot; is just a straightforward printers' error substituting Z for Y (which would have been next to each other in a 19th-century printer's font) which because of Dickens's popularity, entered the mainstream, but that's too far over the line into original research to include. &lt;p&gt;Regarding his nationality, this case is well documented ([[Jan Bondeson]]—or at least his publisher—has an unfortunate habit of giving his books sensationalist-sounding titles, but he's a perfectly well-respected medical historian). As [[User:Angr|Angr]] says above we can only reflect the sources, and ''every'' source describes him as either &quot;Polish&quot; or &quot;a Pole&quot;. Since the First Partition had already taken place at the time of his birth, and we don't know exactly where he was born, it's not appropriate to use any form of wording that implies he was a Polish citizen as opposed to being of Polish ethnicity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8209;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Iridescent|iridescent]] 08:59, 12 October 2015 (UTC)

== Sources ==

Almost everything known about Domery comes from [https://books.google.com/books?id=An-we0KnG78C&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=%22charles+domery%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0COkBEOgBMCVqFQoTCNO3_YyVvcgCFUsnHgod8ikOig#v=onepage&amp;q=%22charles%20domery%22&amp;f=false a 1799 account in the ''Medical and Physical Journal''], written by Dr. Johnston, based largely upon information provided by Dr. Cochrane.  This was reprinted in ''The Eccentric Mirror'', which is cited in the article; the original could be cited and linked, and the heavy reliance on this account could be made explicit.
An 1870 account in the ''Observer'', reprinted in various other newspapers, refers to Domery as &quot;a native of Broche, on the frontiers of Poland.&quot;  I no more know of Broche than I know of Benche (not that I would know necessarily), and it is likely that this was just an error introduced by the ''Observer'', but it is also possible that Broche is correct and Benche the error.

:IMO this story smacks of a heavily embroidered but trivial soldiers' legend. The character's nationality is a side-issue, although it's obvious ''Domery'' (which may have been corrupted in translation) does not reflect Polish morphology. 
:This tale evidently doesn't deal with facts that can be documented from historical sources, and probably shouldn't have become a Featured Article. (And BTW, neither Polish nor German Wikis have a Charles Domery – Karol Domerz – Karl Domerz – entry.) [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 15:46, 12 October 2015 (UTC)

:Agree.  This is a tall-tale.  When an article describes something that violates the laws of physics and thermodynamics, there's no need to quibble about whether its protagonist is German or Polish.

::@Sca and IP: That is unduly dismissive. There is no overt reason to doubt the attested veracity of the doctor's story, and (though I have not read them) I assume that the modern authors cited, including notable medical scientist [[Jan Bondeson]], do not do so, else it would have been noted in the article. There other historical sources which remain to be researched and written about, such as surviving records of the Liverpool POW establishment at TNA/Kew and in Liverpool RO, or perhaps correspondence with the French authorities accounting for payments. 
::Incidentally, I removed reference to &quot;Karol Domerz&quot; as not in the Dickens source cited - and nowhere else to be found, apart from a large number of WP mirrors and quotes - please restore if can be cited.  The only early Polish source I found - ''Kurjer Polski'' (Polish Courier) of 23 February 1830 [http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=94730] has &quot;Karol Domery&quot; from &quot;Bench&quot;, but is only a translation of the earlier English publications, without addition or further comment. I agree with JMB that citing the original and accessible ''Medical and Physical Journal'' (which was quite quickly reported in the press - eg The Ipswich Journal of 9 August 1800) would be better than the later one used.

:::My view rests on internal criticism: on its face the story is not plausible. Doubts about names, sources and translation/transmission further lessen its credibility. It is very far from being factual history (''wie es eigentlich gewesen ist'') attested by multiple sources. Whether its protagonist is represented as Polish or Prusso-German is irrelevant to the epistemic issue. [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 22:17, 12 October 2015 (UTC)
::::Eating cats, rats, candles, and spare limbs? I just wonder how much of this tale is owed to cultural stereotyping. Eric Partridge's ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MUbeCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=candle-eater&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UEgWYOsZuN&amp;sig=IC_tLT-SwyTORBIRDFnOM8iFI5I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgeahUKEwirxp_nj77IAhVKmYAKHa10BX8#v=onepage&amp;q=candle-eater&amp;f=false Dictionary of the Underworld: British and American]'' (1949) defines &quot;candle-eater&quot; as slang for a Russian tramp, or more loosely, any Slav. That usage was current as of the early 1930s. [[User:Vesuvius Dogg|Vesuvius Dogg]] ([[User talk:Vesuvius Dogg|talk]]) 23:43, 12 October 2015 (UTC)

While I share all the concerns above, the problem is that if no sources cast doubt on this story, neither can we - it would be OR for us to say that it is probably a tall tale, stereotypical, or such. However, what we can and should do is to point out (at least in the footnote, and perhaps in a dedicated sources section) that this is based on 19th century sources (or one source, primarily). What  [[User:John M Baker]] wrote in the opening of this section, with minor formatting, seems like a very good footnote to me.--&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 02:35, 13 October 2015 (UTC)

== Nationality ==
Domerz's nationality (ethnicity), would not be an issue if he won the [[Nobel Prize]] in medicine or physiology. Unfortunately he's cited as having eaten 174 cats (and quite a few rats). Therefore, he couldn't possibly be Polish. [[User:Dr. Dan|Dr. Dan]] ([[User talk:Dr. Dan|talk]]) 18:43, 12 October 2015 (UTC)

::Of course the preceding comment serves no purpose relevant to the discussion.

:::And that itself is no great consequence as, so far as we know, it was only in England, in captivity, that Domery and his most unusual condition came to the attention of professional Government-appointed medical practitioners, who wrote about it. Is the hearsay part of the story exaggerated? Quite possibly, but the experimental examination in Liverpool is well attested and the article stays close to the original source (I cannot speak for the modern citations).
