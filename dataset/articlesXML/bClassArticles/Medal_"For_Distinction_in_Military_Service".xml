The '''Medal &quot;For Distinction in Military Service&quot;''' ({{lang-ru|Медаль «За отличие в воинской службе»}}) was a military decoration awarded in two classes by the [[Soviet Union]] and later by the [[Russian Federation]] (until 1995), to deserving military personnel of the Ministry of Defense, of internal troops and of border troops of both the [[USSR]] and Russian Federation.  It was gradually phased out following the [[dissolution of the USSR]] being replaced by various ministerial awards.

== Award history ==
The Medal &quot;For Distinction in Military Service&quot; was established on October 28, 1974 by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.&lt;ref name=&quot;MedalForDistinction&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of  October 28, 1974 | publisher = Legal Library of the USSR | date= 1974-10-28 | url = http://www.libussr.ru/doc_ussr/usr_8433.htm | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its statute was later amended by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet № 2523-X on July 18, 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;Multi amendments&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of  July 18, 1980 № 2523-X | publisher = Legal Library of the USSR | date= 1980-07-18 | url = http://www.libussr.ru/doc_ussr/usr_10402.htm | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was one of the very few Soviet decorations to be retained &quot;as is&quot; following the dissolution of the USSR.  This was confirmed by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the [[Russian Federation]] № 2424-1 of March 2, 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;1992decree&quot;&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation of March 2, 1992 № 2424-1 | publisher = Commission under the President of the Russian Federation on state awards  | date = 1999-12-15 | url = http://award.adm.gov.ru/doc/u2424.htm | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was last awarded in 1995 being replaced by various ministerial decorations such as the [[Awards_of_the_Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_of_Russia#Breast_Badges|decoration &quot;For Distinction in Service of Interior Troops of Russia&quot;]] also awarded in two classes.

== Award statute ==
The Medal &quot;For Distinction in Military Service&quot; was awarded to soldiers of the Soviet [[Red Army|Army]], [[Soviet Navy|Navy]], [[Russian Border Guards|border]] and [[Internal Troops (Russia)|internal troops]]: for excellent performance in combat and political training; for special distinction in exercises and manoeuvres in combat service and combat duty; for bravery, selflessness, and other services, displayed during military service.&lt;ref name=&quot;MedalForDistinction&quot;/&gt;

The award was divided into two classes, first and second, the first class being the highest.  They were awarded sequentially for continued merit.  Each medal came with an attestation of award, this attestation came in the form of a small 8&amp;nbsp;cm by 11&amp;nbsp;cm cardboard booklet bearing the award's name, the recipient's particulars and an official stamp and signature on the inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;MedalForDistinction&quot;/&gt;

The Medal &quot;For Distinction in Military Service&quot; was worn on the right side of the chest following the orders of the USSR.  When not worn, its ribbon's order of precedence in the ribbon bar is immediately after the ribbon of the [[Medal &quot;For Distinction in Guarding the State Border of the USSR&quot;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MedalForDistinction&quot;/&gt; If worn with honorary titles or Orders of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence.&lt;ref name=&quot;decree1631&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of December 16, 2011 No 1631 | publisher = Kremlin News – Site of the President of the Russian Federation | date = 2011-12-16 | url =  http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx?1593594 | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Award description ==
The Medal &quot;For Distinction in Military Service&quot; was a 38mm wide five pointed convex star.  Five shields bearing the emblems of the main branches of the service filled the gaps between its arms.  The obverse bore a central concave medallion bearing the relief images of a soldier, sailor and airman.  The central medallion was framed by a ring bearing the relief inscription &quot;For Distinction in Military Service&quot; ({{lang-ru|«За отличие в воинской службе»}}) on the sides and top, at the bottom of the ring, two laurel branches.  The plain reverse only bore the mark of the Moscow Mint &quot;MMD&quot; ({{lang-ru|«ММД»}}) at the bottom.&lt;ref name=&quot;MedalForDistinction&quot;/&gt;

The medal was secured to a 29,5mm wide by 27,5mm square mount by a ring through the suspension loop. The mount was covered by a red silk [[moiré]] ribbon with two 3mm green stripes located 3mm from the ribbon edges.&lt;ref name=&quot;MedalForDistinction&quot;/&gt;

The medal first class, the metallic parts of its ribbon mount and the star device on its ribbon were made of brass.  The medal second class, the metallic parts of its ribbon mount and the star device on its ribbon were made of cupronickel.&lt;ref name=&quot;MedalForDistinction&quot;/&gt;
