== Infobox order ==

As there has been a bit of an edit-war going on, shall we discuss it? Per [[Template:Infobox military conflict]], &quot;combatant1/combatant2/combatant3 ... Combatants should be listed in order of importance to the conflict, be it in terms of military contribution, political clout, or a recognized chain of command. If differing metrics can support alternative lists, then ordering is left to the editors of the particular article.&quot;

The argument against the status quo has thus far been along the lines of the British engaged far more of the Germans than the Americans did, and the Germans were far more concerned with the British. We could debate strategy all day long, but working from the definition we have:

*military contribution: The US provided more manpower than the British, they even supplied most of the tanks in use by the British forces.
*political clout: The 1941-1944 period saw the British object to a cross-channel invasion due to a variety of reasons. The Americans were the ones who pressed for Overlord, over the British Balkan strategy.
*recognized chain of command: Monty and 21st Army Group may have had overall command of the ground forces, but they were under the command of SHAEF and Ike (who likewise was in overall command of the naval and air forces).

::Per the article, on July 25, 812,000 American troops and 640,000 British and Canadians were part of the campaign. Americans suffered 125,000 causalities compared to 83,000 British and Canadian.

I would like to thank everyone for the discussion and I am going to restate my points
*military contribution: Yes the US provided most of the British tanks but the British supplied many of the landing craft used to get Americans on shore. Yes the Americans had more men but isn't it more important to engage and defeat the enemy, not simply have more men. I have already said that the Germans placed the bulk of their forces in front of the British and Canadians not the Americans, is this really outweighed because the Americans had more troops?
*political clout: Yes the British opposed Normandy form 1941-1944 because they knew how dangerous an amphibious assault was (Gallipoli, Salerno, Anzio), they wanted to wait until the German forces were extremely weak. Had they listened to the Americans and invaded in 1942 or 1943 it would have most likely have been a disaster, I agree that Overlord is much better than the British Balkan Strategy in 1944 but postponing the Invasion until 1944 and conducting the North African and Italian campaigns to draw away German forces was great alternative then invading in 1942 or 1943. Also although the Americans pushed for D-day to happen it was mainly the British who planned the operation (Frederick E. Morgan) and it was the British and Canadians who took on the bulk of German forces in France especially armor and SS troops.
*recognized chain of command: Yes the supreme commander was Ike but the Ground Forces Commander (Monty), Air Forces Commander (Trafford Leigh Mallory), and Naval Forces Commander (Bertram Ramsay) were all British. During the Normandy campaign Ike did not dictate the Campaign, it was only on September 1st when Operation Overlord officially ended that he became Ground Forces Commander. Ike was a good guy but the Supreme Commander position was not the position that dictated the course of battle.
The main reason that is stated for the US doing more is that they had more soldiers and took more casualties. For the casualties please read about the American replacement system and it‚Äôs putting of green young men in the front line of battle. As for having more soldiers I thought a campaign would be dictated by doing damage to the enemy whether it‚Äôs tactical or strategic. Having more Americans does not change the fact that the Germans placed far fewer of their soldiers in the American sector. The British and Canadians had a much tougher time against the best the Germans had to offer in France, I think that doing more to damage the enemy is more important than having more soldiers. For me the British where more important to the victory in Normandy because even though they had less troops they did far more damage to the Germans (which is how you win a campaign) while the Americans who had more troops did less to the overall defeat of the Germans in Normandy. So which is more important to winning a campaign having more soldiers then your ally or doing more damage to your enemy?-Colonialmarine9
:The Allied strategy was one of teamwork; pinning down the Germans in the east to allow an encircling battle to fought. Not to mention, the western terrain (centered in bocage) was easier to defend than the largely open farmland to the east; German dispositions should take this into effect as well.
:The British roles at the head of the various forces is another example of the political situation. A British commander was (during the war) never going to be at the top because the Americans took leadership of the alliance due to the men they could field bolstered by their political and industrial strength to the other powers.[[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 18:12, 6 January 2016 (UTC)

I agree 100% it was teamwork, the British Commonwealth couldn't have done it without the Americans and the Americans couldn't have done it without the British Commonwealth. Ike was the perfect man for the job of Supreme Commander as he got along with everyone and kept the allied team together. I understand it was a political situation but the facts are that although Ike was American his position was not to dictate the course of battle that was the job of his subordinates on the ground, air, and sea which were all British.  My argument is that the British and Canadian role in tying up and wearing down the bulk of the German forces (thus allowing the American breakout) is more important than the Americans having more soldiers than their ally or having a supreme commander of their nationality.-Colonialmarine9
:Alternately, it could be said that the British became bogged down around Caen due to a series of bungled battles and the poor performance of some units, and the Americans played the more significant role in winning the campaign - and there are any number of works which support such an interpretation of events. It seems more sensible to stick to an ordering based on the size of the forces and the casualties they incurred. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 07:32, 7 January 2016 (UTC)
::That is true, and has been one of the major controversies surrounding the campaign for about as long as it has been studied (and one could probably argue, while it was underway).[[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 13:22, 7 January 2016 (UTC)

== Tanks destroyed by aircraft ==

On 29 July, RAF 121 Wing launched 99 sorties with rocket firing Typhoons scoring only two tanks destroyed.(Copp, Montgomery's Scientists, pp. 167-171) On 7 August, and the following days in the Mortain area, over 700 sorties were flown by Anglo-American planes (a mixture of bombs and rockets split between the American and British aircraft) only seven tanks were confirmed to have been destroyed by rockets and a further two by bombs.(pp. 173-175) Of the 90 tanks found abandoned or destroyed within the Falaise Pocket, only four were confirmed to have been destroyed by rockets and a further two by bombs.(p. 183) Moving ahead to the Ardennes, the air force claimed 324 tanks destroyed. Out of 101 German armor vehicles examined, only four tanks were suspected of being destroyed by air attack.(p. 207)

I think the following [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Overlord&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=706620196&amp;oldid=706595767 diff] needs a little more evidence considering it is claiming around 10 per cent of the tanks destroyed.[[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 00:05, 25 February 2016 (UTC)
::The problem is that you seem to be just taking a small set of actions and assuming that the source must be wrong based on them. Unless those account for literally every single tank kill at Normandy, this is not really logical. You also seem to be ignoring how incredibly heavy the bombardment was at Normandy, when compared to the Ardennes. On the other hand, the source I cited (which is also cited on the rest of the page as an RS) gives an overall total for the number of tanks killed by aircraft. I would actually assert that stronger evidence than that would be needed (it seems you're relying on extrapolation and supposition) to just throw away information given in one of this page's main sources. Unless you have a more reliable source that explicitly contradicts it?--[[User:Nihlus1|Nihlus1]] ([[User talk:Nihlus1|talk]]) 07:34, 25 February 2016 (UTC)
:::I would really like to know where they get there figure from, what is there source? The air force, granted made extreme numbers of sorties but they also made claims that were not supported in the ground. The examples given, from the operational research, were from several areas were the heaviest concentration of direct support had came from the air force in attacking German tanks. The operational research, at least what is printed, highlighted just how over the top the claims were and just how few tanks were being taken out.
:::Additional sources talk about the issue: [https://books.google.com/books?id=I10OjlPjcI0C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=normandy+tanks+destroyed+from+air&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif7rOhzZLLAhXD5iYKHVd_BoYQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=normandy%20tanks%20destroyed%20from%20air&amp;f=false here], [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZCDINZHWCIC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=normandy+tanks+destroyed+from+air&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif7rOhzZLLAhXD5iYKHVd_BoYQ6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=normandy%20tanks%20destroyed%20from%20air&amp;f=false here], [https://books.google.com/books?id=G87TWxGRMscC&amp;pg=PT380&amp;dq=normandy+tanks+destroyed+from+air&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjowbmxz5LLAhUBYiYKHcveDD84ChDoAQgmMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=normandy%20tanks%20destroyed%20from%20air&amp;f=false here] etc (there are lots more, that is just a quick sample).
:::The simple point being, we should use caution despite the claim being made in a RS[[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 09:45, 25 February 2016 (UTC)
::::The sentence mentioning 100 tank kills is in the context of pointing out that AFV kills were over claimed. It is also below what aircraft claim to have destroyed in a single day. Therefore &quot;AFV kills were over claimed&quot; isn't really sufficient ground to throw away information given by one of this page's main RSs. I again ask if you have any evidence proving it wrong (that is, a statement from a reliable historian or the militaries themselves saying that substantially less than 100 were destroyed), because three picked handful of engagements in a three month operation involving some of the heaviest bombardment of the war really isn't it.--[[User:Nihlus1|Nihlus1]] ([[User talk:Nihlus1|talk]]) 22:07, 25 February 2016 (UTC)

:::: Absolutely agree. It is well known that there was gross over-claiming of AFV kills by aircraft. Regards, [[User:DMorpheus2|DMorpheus2]] ([[User talk:DMorpheus2|talk]]) 14:44, 25 February 2016 (UTC)
:::::I have been doing some additional reading on the subject, and it seems that the 100 figure is quite common and people do not really have qualrms with it. As noted, yes the Allied bombing was quite heavy and it would seem that most of the figure could be attributed to Operation Goodwood, then the various isolated incidents (such as the ones examined in the German counterattack and retreat) just pile up in the end. 
:::::With so much information out there on the over-estimates etc, I was just wanting to ensure this figure was accurate so to avoid possibly perputating a myth. I withdraw my (in good faith) objection.[[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 09:25, 26 February 2016 (UTC)

== 90 day battle ==

As can be seen from my recent edit, I have removed mention of it. First, I would like to apologize as on a second review I do see mention of it on that particular page.

However, the contentious part of my edit summary stands. While sources, such as Weinberg, do state so; I have read enough over the years that have stated otherwise. For example, after describing the general outline of what Overlord intended to achieve, the Canadian official history states &quot;This great turning movement would bring the Allied line forward to the Seine on a 140-mile front. General Montgomery afterwards commented on the &quot;academic&quot; nature of forecasts in an operation of this magnitude. Nevertheless, the Allied planners had some hope, if not expectation, that their troops would reach the Seine and the Loire 90 days after the initial assault.43 This tentative forecast was closely connected with the administrative aspects of the planning.&quot; (Stacey, p. 84)

I was unable to locate any mention in the American official history ''Cross Channel Attack''. The volume ''Logistical Support of the Armies, Volume I: May 1941-September 1944'' echoes what Stacey states, all mention of D-Day+90 is in regards to logistical planning of who is going to have access to what port etc.

As i find additional sources, I will post. Regards, [[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 16:30, 14 March 2016 (UTC)

'''Here is a pre-D-day source:''' 
OUTLINE OF OPERATION OVERLORD
[Note: This manuscript was prepared by the Historical Section of the G-4 of the Communications Zone, European Theater of Operations (COMZ, ETOUSA) as volume seven of its multi-volume manuscript organizational history. It was subsequently deposited at the Office of the Chief of Military History (OCMH; now US Army Center of Military History) for reference use by historians preparing the official history of the Army in World War II. It is typical of the kinds of detailed studies routinely acquired (as in this case) or carried out by the deployed historians during World War II. The original is on file in the Historical Manuscripts Collection (HMC) under file number 8-3.4 AA v.7

And here is the money quote: &quot;Situation on D+90: By D+90, occupation of the lodgment area is complete. U.S. and British Forces are on the Seine River, First and Third Armies are abreast, and First Army Group has been established as has a Communications line. Our forces are prepared for further offensive operations.&quot;

I do not yet know the date of preparation but clearly it was prior to the invasion.

:Thanks for that. That link also includes an image I have been routing for: http://www.history.army.mil/documents/wwii/g4-ol/g4-OL-4.jpg I have seen this brought up on several occasions as the logistical and administration outline for Overlord, and the basis for the claim of the battle being envisioned for just 90 days.
:Further digging has Ellis claim &quot;...for it was never expected to reach the Seine in less than about three months&quot; (Ellis, p. 78); this about the only comment I could so far find in regards to a timetable. 
:Further digging has the US logistic green book state, this &quot;was to complete the mission announced in the OVERLORD plan-the establishment of the lodgment. This was expected to require three months (to D plus 90).&quot; For possible further development of the article, it adds &quot;The plan made an additional assumption which was to prove historically significant so far as logistic operations were concerned: a pause would probably be necessary upon the completion of the operation to permit the development of the administrative base in preparation for an advance beyond the Seine.&quot; (Ruppenthal, p. 189)
:Likewise, further digging in cross-channel assault finds: &quot;The Allied forces together would push to the Seine, securing the final lodgment area by about D plus 90 and completing the initial phase of Operation OVERLORD. The final stages of the operation were conceived and stated in these broad terms. '''The outlined scheme of maneuver and the timetables were not designed as tactical plans; they were frames of refrence for future planning, set forth primarily so that he men of the beginning should have some idea of the shape of the end, so that their thinking might be large and heir preparation adequate.'''&quot; Emphases added .(Harrison, p. 188).[[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 17:50, 14 March 2016 (UTC)

::: Not relevant to this discussion but - that map includes &quot;FUSAG&quot; - the First United States Army Group, (what in fact became the 12th Army Group) and while it includes US 3rd and 1st Armies, it also seems to include British XXX Corps.

== 'Campaign closes' ==

I'm not very keen on para 1 of the 'Campaign closes' section. All that stuff about Eisenhower assuming command, the Ardennes offensive and Hitler committing suicide in his bunker is fine, but I'm not so sure it is needed in this article or even relevant to it.&lt;br&gt; 
Maybe it can be used elsewhere. I've had a look at this article without the offending paragraph - it's fine, the lack of para 1 is hardly noticeable.  

I did not want to permanently remove it without some sort of consensus.&lt;br&gt; 
What do other editors think?

[[User:RASAM|RASAM]] ([[User talk:RASAM|talk]]) 19:54, 6 October 2016 (UTC)
:Hi, I don't think it's so much that the paragraph isn't useful, more that it jars a bit with the rest of the section, which an assessment of the Overlord operation -- and I say that having been responsible for passing the article at GAN, when its form was essentially the same as now. Perhaps the first paragraph could be moved to a final subsection under the previous section, and then the resultant Campaign Close section could be re-retitled Assessment or some such. What do you (and others) think of that? Cheers, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) 21:42, 6 October 2016 (UTC)
:I think moving the paragraph is a better option than removal. Most of our readers are high school students encountering the topic for the first time, and these background details are useful to help place Overlord in sequence with other related events. Re-titling the &quot;Campaign close&quot; section as &quot;Assessment&quot; or &quot;Analysis&quot; would then be a sensible amendment. ‚Äî [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;üçÅ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 22:37, 6 October 2016 (UTC)
* I'd keep it, although I wouldn't want it any larger. It does give the overall context and timescale.
: Remember that the majority of our readers here are schoolkids, this is some of the first WWII history they encounter, and they just don't yet know how long the rest of it took. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 13:09, 7 October 2016 (UTC)</text>
