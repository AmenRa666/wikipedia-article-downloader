The '''305th Rescue Squadron''' is part of the [[943rd Rescue Group]] at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], Arizona, a subordinate of the [[920th Rescue Wing]] at [[Patrick Air Force Base]], Florida. It operates [[HH-60 Pave Hawk]] aircraft conducting peacetime and combat [[search and rescue]] missions.

The 305th was originally activated at [[Selfridge Air Force Base]], Michigan in 1958 as the '''305th Air Rescue Squadron'''.  It trained for and performed [[search and rescue]] operations, primarily in the upper midwestern United States, from 1958 until 1992.  It deployed personnel worldwide to support active duty forces and was called to active duty for eighteen months after the [[USS Pueblo incident]].  In 1985, a squadron crew earned the Koran Kolligan, Jr. Trophy, the highest safety award in the Air Force, for successfully landing their severely disabled HH-3 helicopter.  The squadron was inactivated in 1992 and its aircraft transferred to the active Air Force or to storage.

The unit was again activated the following year at Davis-Monthan, where it was equipped with HH-60s in 1994.  It has participated in most major operations in Southwest Asia since that date.  It also flew rescue missions following [[Hurricane Katrina]] and is the only [[United States Air Force]] rescue unit that is capable of operating from ships.

==Mission==
The '''305th Rescue Squadron''' is trained and equipped to conduct day or night [[combat search and rescue]] missions worldwide with the [[HH-60G Pavehawk]] helicopter. Its primary mission is to penetrate enemy territory, recover downed [[aircrew]]s, and return them to friendly forces. Additionally, the squadron flies [[search and rescue]] missions within the United States.&lt;ref name=DM305RS/&gt;  It searches for, locates and recovers personnel involved with United States defense activities and provides search and rescue support of civilians as directed by the [[Air Force Rescue Coordination Center]] The squadron also provides humanitarian and disaster relief operations at the request of foreign governments and the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]].&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.920rqw.afrc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=13958 |last1=|first1=|title=305th Rescue Squadron|date=2013-03-26|publisher=943d Rescue Group Public Affairs|deadurl=no |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If called to active duty, the unit's gaining command is [[Air Combat Command]] at [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Grumman SA-16A Air Rescue (4662042136).jpg|thumb|left|Grumman SA-16A as first flown by the 305th]]

===First Activation: 1958-1992===
The 305th was first activated as the '''305th Air Rescue Squadron''' at [[Selfridge Air Force Base]], Michigan, in April 1958&lt;ref name=305RSfacts/&gt; and was assigned four [[Grumman SA-16A Albatross]] amphibious aircraft and 90 personnel. Its gaining command was the [[Air Rescue Service]] of [[Military Air Transport Service]].&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In January 1966, Military Air Transport Service Became Military Airlift Command and Air Rescue Service became Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service. Air Rescue Service returned to its original designation in 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 305th supported local peacetime rescue operations while maintaining combat deployable status. It also participated in foreign training exercises with Brazil, Honduras and Venezuela.  The squadron's peacetime operations included the recovery of eleven seamen from a sinking Canadian freighter in [[Lake Erie]] and the transport of fourteen workers critically injured from a factory accident.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;

[[File:Boeing KC-97G-26-BO Stratofreighter 52-2688.jpg|thumb|Boeing C-97G Stratofreighter]]
In late 1965, the unit began to replace its SA-16s with [[Boeing HC-97 Stratofreighter]]s, and in January 1966 it was redesignated as the '''305th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron'''.&lt;ref name=305RSfacts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/431/620.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 305 Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron Jan-Jun 1966|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1966 and 1967 the unit provided rescue cover for Operation Hi-Cat, which involved research on turbulance at high altitude by [[Lockheed U-2]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/431/621.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 305 Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron Jul-Dec 1966|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/431/624.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 305 Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron Jan-Jun 1967|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron was called to active duty following the [[USS Pueblo incident]] in January 1968 and deployed personnel and equipment to the Far East.  While on active duty, it earned both an [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] and a [[Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross|Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross w/ Palm]].   It was returned to reserve status in June 1969.   Other deployments included locations in Libya, Spain, North Africa, Greece, Germany, Italy, England, Iceland, and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;

[[File:Lockheed HC-130H Hercules (L-382), USA - Air Force AN2203516.jpg|thumb|left|305th Squadron Lockheed HC-130H Hercules]]
In 1972 the unit upgraded to [[Lockheed HC-130 Hercules]] aircraft, which gave the squadron the capability to refuel rescue helicopters.&lt;ref name=305RSfacts/&gt;  The unit participated in the test and evaluation of the Air Force's C-130 Self-Contained Navigation System and also provided support for [[space shuttle]] missions.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;  Four years later, the squadron added its first rotary wing aircraft when it was assigned [[Sikorsky HH-3 Jolly Green Giant]] helicopters.  It continued to operate a combination of HC-130s and HC-3s until 1992.  For part of this period, it also flew the CH-3 cargo model of the H-3.&lt;ref name=305RSfacts/&gt;

[[File:HH-3E USAF Reserve hoisting crewmen 1981.jpg|thumb|AF Reserve HH-3 hoisting crewmen in 1981]]
In 1985, Major Larry Brooks and his crew earned the Koran Kolligan, Jr. Trophy, the highest safety award in the Air Force, for successfully landing their severely disabled HH-3 helicopter after one of the engines exploded.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/094/703.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 403 Rescue and Weather Reconnaissance Wing Jul-Dec 1986|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1980s, the 305th also provided rescue coverage for tactical fighter and [[United States Army|Army]] units deploying from the United States to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/003/203.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 305 Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron Fiscal Year 1974|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, pararescue personnel from the squadron deployed to the Persian Gulf to support the [[Liberation of Kuwait campaign]].&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;   The squadron deployed personnel and aircraft to [[Naval Air Station Keflavík]], [[Iceland]], during and after the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=305RSfacts/&gt;  In 1992, with the drawdown of active and reserve forces, the squadron's HC-130 Hercules aircraft were transferred to active duty units and its HH-3 Jolly Green helicopters were retired. The 305th was inactivated on 30 September 1992.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;

===Current era: 1993-present===
In October 1993 the squadron was again activated on paper at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], Arizona.&lt;ref name=305RSfacts/&gt;  On 1 March 1994, the [[71st Special Operations Squadron]] at Davis-Monthan was inactivated and the 305th assumed its mission, personnel and assets when the 71st returned to Davis-Monthan from a six-month tasking for [[Operation Provide Comfort II]].  On 19 May 1994, the 305th was credited with its first save since reactivation. One of its crews completed a rescue using night vision goggles and a Stokes litter to hoist an injured [[United States Army|Army]] specialist from a sixty degree mountain slope that was surrounded by forty to sixty foot trees.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;

Ten months after beginning its conversion to HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters the squadron was tasked to support Provide Comfort II . The squadron deployed three HH-60G Pave Hawks and 95 personnel and accomplished 315 combat sorties during this deployment.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt; It trained for combat search and rescue and performed search and rescue operations primarily in the [[Southwestern United States]].  The 305th also supported counterdrug operations to civilian agencies from 1994.&lt;ref name=305RSfacts/&gt;

In 2002, the 305th Rescue Squadron was activated for one year under a partial mobilization order to participate in [[Operation Enduring Freedom|Operations Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Southern Watch|Southern Watch]] at [[Al Jaber Air Base]] in Kuwait.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;  From April through July 2005 the squadron again deployed for Operation Enduring Freedom.  During this time the squadron flew several rescue missions, including the recovery of a lone surviving [[SEAL]] team member in the mountains east of Bagram, Afghanistan.  Upon its return to the United States in August, the unit deployed to Louisiana and Texas to assist in the rescue of thousands of people in the aftermath of hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]].&lt;ref name=305RSfacts/&gt;

In 2005, [[Air Force Reserve Command]] expanded its rescue organization at Davis Monthan.  The 305th was reassigned to the newly activated [[943rd Rescue Group]] and was joined by the 306th Rescue Squadron, which provided a separate unit for pararescue personnel.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.920rqw.afrc.af.mil/units/920threscuewingrecruiting/920threscuewingpararescuesquadrons/index.asp |last1=|first1=|title=920th Rescue Wing Pararescue Squadrons|date=|publisher=920th Rescue Wing|deadurl=no |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From January through March 2007 the squadron again deployed for Operation Enduring Freedom.  During the deployment, it rescued 14 injured US military personnel from a crashed [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] helicopter.  It deployed again from March to September 2008 and flew over 340 combat sorties and assisted in saving the lives of over 480 people and two military dogs.&lt;ref name=305RSfacts/&gt;

The 305th Rescue Squadron is the first and only Air Force reserve helicopter unit to gain the ability to operate from shipboard.&lt;ref name=AFRC305RS/&gt;
