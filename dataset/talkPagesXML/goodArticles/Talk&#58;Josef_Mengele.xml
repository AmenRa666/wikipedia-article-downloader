== Incoming prisoners? ==

Quote from the second paragraph of Auschwitz: &quot;Incoming Jews were segregated; those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labor were immediately killed in the gas chambers.&quot; Do we mean that Jews were specifically separated from the other arrivals? I understood that all incoming prisoners were split between the fit and unfit categories, but I don't have access to the ref. It becomes a little unclear then if Mengele focused his experiments primarily on Jews, along with some Romani, or if this work was done equivalently across all prisoners. Comments? [[User:Jxm|jxm]] ([[User talk:Jxm|talk]]) 16:07, 26 September 2015 (UTC)
:The source book ''Auschwitz: A New History'' is available locally and I can go fetch it if need be. The vast majority of the occupants of Auschwitz were Jewish. The selections were undertaken among Jews only, who were collected from points all over Europe and arrived in Auschwitz by the trainload. The Romani did not undergo selection on the ramp; they were sent to a separate Gypsy camp. Prisoners of war did not undergo selection. Do you think this passage needs to be re-worded to make it clearer? -- [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] ([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 16:37, 26 September 2015 (UTC)
::Thanks for the info. With agreement, I'll refine the text to reflect this clarification. [[User:Jxm|jxm]] ([[User talk:Jxm|talk]]) 01:55, 4 October 2015 (UTC)

== Confirmed fake passport still pictured in the article ==

In January 2014, the Italian passport said to have been used by Mengele to enter Argentina which was found by Craig Gottlieb was heavily mediatized on TV, newspapers and on the web, including on Wikipedia. A few days later, it was found that the passport was a fake, as this Italian 1947 passport was using... an argentinian police mugshot taken in 1956. So I think that the fake passport should be removed from the Mengele wiki page. The original Argentinian mugshot is even included at the left of the fake passport picture.

: It is indeed suspicious.  See [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/1/19/20150617111600%21WP_Josef_Mengele_1956.jpg this uncropped version], which makes clear that it isn't just another copy of a passport photo. Also see the same photo minus the passport stamps on an Argentinian document [http://cdn.sandiegouniontrib.com/img/photos/2014/01/24/mengelepassport2_t837.jpg here].  But can you provide a reliable source confirming the fakery?  I see lots of noise on blogs, but we can't use those.

::I have removed the photo of the passport, which might be fake. Note we have the same photo in that very section, labelled as being taken in 1956 (not 1947) . — [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] ([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 20:32, 6 February 2016 (UTC)

== Vera Alexander witness conjoined twins ==

This article says they died of gangrene but the Holocaust article says their mother got them morphine and the children were killed to end their suffering.  Consistent sources should be used across the two articles.  -[[User:KaJunl|KaJunl]] ([[User talk:KaJunl|talk]]) 17:44, 28 February 2016 (UTC)
:It looks like these were two different sets of twins, because the ones in Berenbaum p.194 were named Guido and Ina, and the ones in Posner and Ware p.37 were named Tito and Nino. — [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] ([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 18:53, 28 February 2016 (UTC)

== Wrong city where he bought the bungalow ==

The place where he bought the bungalow was a house in the neighbourhood of Eldorado located in the city of Diadema, not Eldorado the town.  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/189.100.82.32|189.100.82.32]] ([[User talk:189.100.82.32|talk]]) 19:48, 20 August 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Corrected; good catch. Also, this is in Posner &amp; Ware (1986) pp.242–243, not in Levy as previously cited. — [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] ([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 21:00, 20 August 2016 (UTC)</text>
