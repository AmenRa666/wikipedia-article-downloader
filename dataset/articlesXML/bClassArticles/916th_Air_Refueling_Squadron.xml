The '''916th Air Refueling Squadron''' is an inactive [[United States Air Force]] unit. It was last assigned to the [[307th Air Refueling Group]] at [[Travis Air Force Base]], California, where it was inactivated on 31 October 1983.

The squadron was first activated late in [[World War II]] as the '''16th Bombardment Squadron''', Very Heavy, a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] unit.  After training with [[Second Air Force]], the squadron moved to [[Guam]], where it participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Japan.  It earned a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] in July 1945.  After the war it remained on Guam until August 1946, when it was inactivated.

The '''916th Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated at Travis in 1958 when the [[5th Bombardment Wing]] participated in the [[Strategic Air Command]] program to disperse its bomber force over a larger number of bases to reduce vulnerability to a first strike.  The squadron remained at Travis after the 5th wing moved to [[Minot Air Force Base]], North Dakota.  It maintained an alert status during the [[Cold War]] and participated in contingency operations until being inactivated.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:16thbg-b-29.jpg|thumb|left|B-29 of the 16th Bombardment Group]]
The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated on 1 April 1944 at [[Dalhart Army Air Field]], Texas as the '''16th Bombardment Squadron''', Very Heavy, one of the four original squadrons of the [[16th Bombardment Group]].&lt;ref name=Maurer16BS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer16BG&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;  It was equipped with [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]es for training, due to shortage of [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]es.  The ground echelon moved to [[Fairmont Army Air Field]], Kansas, in August 1944,&lt;ref name=Maurer16BS/&gt; while the air echelon trained with the [[Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics]] at [[Orlando Army Air Base]], Florida before joining them at Fairmont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/077/988.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 16 Bombardment Group Aug 1944|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completion of training the unit deployed to the central Pacific area in the spring of 1945, where it became part of [[XXI Bomber Command]] at [[Northwest Field (Guam)]].&lt;ref name=Maurer16BS/&gt;  The squadron entered combat on 16 June 1945 with a bombing raid against an airfield on [[Moen (island)|Moen]]. It flew its first mission against the Japanese home islands on 26 June 1945 and afterwards operated principally against the enemy's petroleum industry.  Between 29 July and 5 August 1945, the unit flew a series of unescorted missions against the [[oil refinery]] at [[Shimotsu, Wakayama|Shimotsu]], The [[Mitsubishi]] refinery and oil installations at [[Kawasaki, Fukuoka|Kawasaki]] and [[coal liquifaction]] plants at [[Ube, Yamaguchi|Ube]] in the face of strong enemy opposition.  For these missions, the 16th earned a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]].&lt;ref name=Maurer16BG/&gt;

The unit flew its last combat mission on 15 August 1945, after which it [[airdrop]]ped food and supplies to Allied [[prisoners of war]] in Japan, Manchuria and Korea.&lt;ref name=Maurer16BG/&gt;  It flew in several [[show of force]] missions, including one on 2 September 1945 over [[Tokyo Bay]] during formal Japanese Surrender. After the war, the unit flew long distance transport missions back to the United States.&lt;ref name=Maurer16BG/&gt;  In February 1946, squadron personnel were transferred to the [[501st Bombardment Group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/077/998.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 16 Bombardment Group Sep 1945 – Apr 1946|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the squadron was inactivated on Guam 15 April 1946.&lt;ref name=Maurer16BS/&gt;

===Cold War===

The '''916th Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated on 1 September 1959 by [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) at [[Travis Air Force Base]], California&lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;''See'' Mueller, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; and equipped with [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s.  The [[5th Bombardment Wing]] had recently converted to [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers and had transferred two of its bomber squadrons to other bases in a SAC program to disperse its [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/056/917.xml|last1=|first1=|title=Abstract (Unclassified), Vol 1, History of Strategic Air Command, Jan–Jun 1957 (Secret)|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadron mission was to provide air refueling to the remaining B-52s of its parent wing and other Air Force units as directed.  Starting in 1960, one third of the squadron's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute [[alert state|alert]], fully fueled and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike.  This was increased to half the squadron's aircraft in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/010/802.xml|last1=|first1=|title=Abstract (Unclassified), History of the Strategic Bomber since 1945 (Top Secret, downgraded to Secret)|date=1 April 1975|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The unit continued to maintain an alert commitment until shortly before inactivation except for periods when it supported contingencies or deployed aircraft.   The squadron deployed crews and planes to the Young Tiger Task Force in Thailand and from its west coast location frequently supported deployments of [[Tactical Air Command]] fighters across the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/010/084.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 916 Air Refueling Squadron Jul–Sep 1975|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also supported Tanker Task Forces located at [[Eielson Air Force Base]], Alaska; [[Anderson Air Force Base]], Guam; [[RAF Mildenhall]], England and [[Torrejon Air Base]], Spain.&lt;ref name=916AREFS1976&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/006/659.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 916 Air Refueling Squadron Jan–Mar 1975|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/017/289.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 916 Air Refueling Squadron Oct–Dec 1976|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 916th was reassigned to the [[14th Strategic Aerospace Division]] at [[Beale Air Force Base]], California in 1968 when the 5th Bombardment Wing moved on paper to [[Minot Air Force Base]], North Dakota.&lt;ref name=14ADfacts&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=10069 |title=Factsheet 14 Air Division |publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120929013824/http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=10069 |date=4 October 2007|archivedate=29 September 2012|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravenstein5BW&gt;Ravenstein, pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;  Between March 1970 and April 1972 It was assigned to the [[47th Air Division]] at [[Fairchild Air Force Base]], but it then returned to the control of the 14th Air Division.  From 1972 to 1975, [[Marcelite J. Harris]], the first female African-American [[general officer]] in the [[United States Air Force]], served as field maintenance supervisor with the squadron.  General Harris had just become the first female certified maintenance officer in the Air Force when she served with the 916th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5723 |title=Biography, Major General Marcelite J.

The squadron was also called on to support Air Force test and development programs.  In 1974, a squadron [[tanker (aircraft)|tanker]] participated in the first long range overwater refueling of a [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/003/152.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 916 Air Refueling Squadron Jul–Sep 1974|date=12 December 1974|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1976 the squadron helped test the compatibility of KC-135s with [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/015/039.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 916 Air Refueling Squadron Apr–Jun 1976|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that same year it participated in the initial operational testing and evaluation of the [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]].&lt;ref name=916AREFS1976/&gt;  Five years later it provided refueling support for B-52s testing the [[AGM-86 Air Launched Cruise Missile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/015/039.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract (Unclassified), History 916 Air Refueling Squadron Apr–Jun 1981 (Secret)|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 1977 the 916th was assigned to the [[307th Air Refueling Group]].&lt;ref name=307OGfacts&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18305 |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 307 Operations Group (AFRC)|date=2011-05-24|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|deadurl=no |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1979, the group earned the Spaatz Trophy as the best air refueling organization in the Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/114/099.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, 307 Air Refueling Group Historical Heritage Program Pamphlet|date=15 July 1980|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron and group were inactivated on 31 Oct 1983 and the majority of its aircraft were transferred to [[Carswell Air Force Base]] due to a shift in air refueling requirements that required better coverage for SAC conventional forces in the southeastern United States.&lt;ref name=307OGfacts/&gt;&lt;ref name=307AREFG1983&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/055/672.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 307 Air Refueling Group Jul–Oct 1983|date=20 December 1983 |publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/053/787.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 307 Air Refueling Group Jan–Mar 1983|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its twenty-four year history, the squadron had never experienced a single aircraft accident.  At the dinner marking the squadron's inactivation it was announced that a squadron [[aircrew|crew]] was the winner of the 1983 air refueling crew of the year award.&lt;ref name=307AREFG1983/&gt;

The '''916th Air Refueling Squadron''' and the '''16th Bombardment Squadron''' were consolidated into a single unit on 19 September 1985.&lt;ref name=DAFMPM662q&gt;Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 662q, 19 September 85, Subject: Reconstitution, Redesignation, and Consolidation of Selected Air Force Tactical Squadrons&lt;/ref&gt;
