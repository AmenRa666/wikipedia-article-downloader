The '''French ironclad ''Trident''''' was the second and last ship of the {{sclass-|Colbert|ironclad}}s that were built for the [[French Navy]] in the 1870s. The ship was the [[flagship]] of the deputy commander of the [[Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (France)|Mediterranean Squadron]] for most of her career. She took part in the [[French occupation of Tunisia]], notably shelling and landing troops in [[Sfax]] in 1881. ''Trident'' was reclassified as a [[training ship]] in 1894 and condemned in 1900, before she was finally sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1909.

==Design and description==
The ''Colbert''-class ships were designed by Constructor Sabattier as improved versions of the ironclad {{ship|French ironclad|Richelieu||2}}. As a [[Central battery ship|central battery ironclad]], ''Trident'' had her armament concentrated [[amidships]].&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; Like most ironclads of her era she was equipped with a plough-shaped [[Naval ram|ram]]. Her crew numbered 774 officers and men. The [[metacentric height]] of the ship was low, a little above {{convert|2|ft|m|1|disp=flip|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship measured {{convert|102.1|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length overall|overall]],&lt;ref name=s2&gt;Silverstone, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.7|m|ftin|sp=us}}. ''Trident'' had a maximum [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|8.58|m|ftin|sp=us}} and displaced {{convert|8814|t|LT|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=g7&gt;Gille, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propulsion===
''Trident'' had a single Wolf three-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|horizontal return connecting-rod compound steam engine]] that drove one propeller. The engine was powered by eight oval [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s and was designed for a capacity of {{convert|4600|ihp|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; On [[sea trial]]s, the engine produced {{convert|4882|PS|lk=in}} and ''Trident'' reached {{convert|14.18|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=g6&gt;Gille, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; She carried a maximum of {{convert|620|MT|LT}}&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; of coal which allowed her to steam for approximately {{convert|3300|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; ''Trident'' was [[ship rig]]ged with three masts and had a sail area around {{convert|23000|sqft|sqm|sp=us|disp=flip}}.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

===Armament===
''Trident'' had two {{convert|274|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us|1}} guns mounted in [[barbette]]s on the upper deck, one gun at the forward corners of the [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]], with six additional guns on the battery deck below the barbettes. The side of the upper deck were cut away to improve the ability of the barbette guns to bear fore and aft. One {{convert|240|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} was mounted in the forecastle as a [[chase gun]]. The ship's secondary armament consisted of six {{convert|138|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns, four forward of the battery and two aft. These latter two guns were replaced in 1878 by another 240-millimeter gun as a stern chaser. The ship also mounted four above-water {{convert|356|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=d289&gt;de Balincourt and Vincent-Bréchignac, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Canon de 27 cm modèle 1870 IMG 7012.JPG|thumb|left|Canon de 27 cm modèle 1870 in the armoured section of a ''Colbert'' class ironclad, by Gustave Bourgain, circa 1885.]]
All of the ship's guns could fire both [[Round shot|solid shot]] and explosive shells. The 274-millimeter Modèle 1870 gun was credited with the ability to penetrate a maximum {{convert|14.3|in}} of [[wrought iron]] armor while the 240-millmeter Modèle 1870 gun could  penetrate {{convert|14.4|in|mm|0}} of wrought iron armor.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point the ship received fourteen to eighteen {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns]].&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; They fired a shell weighing about {{convert|500|g|lb|abbr=on}} to a range of about {{convert|3200|m|yd|sp=us}}. They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_1pounder_m1.htm|title=United States of America 1-pdr (0.45 kg) 1.46&quot; (37 mm) Marks 1 through 15|date=14 January 2011|accessdate=14 December 2013|publisher=Navweps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armor===
The ''Colbert''-class ships had a complete wrought iron [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|belt]] that was {{convert|220|mm|in|sp=us|1}} thick amidships and tapered to {{convert|180|mm|in|sp=us|1}} at the stern. It was backed by {{convert|89|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of wood. The sides of the battery itself were armored with {{convert|160|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of wrought iron, backed by {{convert|62|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of wood, and the ends of the battery were closed by transverse armored bulkheads {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|1}} thick, backed by {{convert|480|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of wood. The barbettes were unarmored, but the [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|15|mm|in|sp=us}} thick.&lt;ref name=d29&gt;de Balincourt and Vincent-Bréchignac, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==
''Trident'', named after the weapon that symbolized mastery of the seas,&lt;ref name=s4&gt;Silverstone, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Keel|laid down]] in April 1870 in [[Toulon]] and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 9 November 1876.&lt;ref name=g7/&gt; While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known, it is believed that reduction of the French Navy's budget after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71 and out-of-date work practices in French dockyards were likely causes.&lt;ref&gt;Ropp, pp. 31, 55–58&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was completed on 1 November 1878&lt;ref name=s4/&gt; and became the flagship of the second-in-command of the Mediterranean Squadron the following month.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; ''Trident'', together with her sister ship {{ship|French ironclad|Colbert||2}}, bombarded the Tunisian port of [[Sfax]] on 15–16 July 1881 as the French occupied Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; She was disarmed and placed in reserve in 1886–89,&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; but was recommissioned on 17 February 1889&lt;ref name=d29/&gt; and resumed her role as flagship until she was again placed in reserve in 1894. The ship served as a gunnery training ship until she was condemned on 5 March 1900.&lt;ref name=g6/&gt; ''Trident'' was renamed ''Var'' in 1904 and was sold for scrap five years later.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;
