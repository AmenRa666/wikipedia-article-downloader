'''[[Count]] Burkhard Christoph von Münnich''' (9 May 1683 – 16 October 1767) ({{lang|ru|''Христофо́р Анто́нович Миних''}}) was a [[Germans|German]] soldier-[[engineer]] who became a [[field marshal]] and [[political figure]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the major Russian Army reformer and founder of several elite military formations during the reign of [[Anna of Russia]]. As a statesman, he is regarded as the founder of Russian [[Philhellenism]]. Münnich also was a hereditary engineer and a specialist in [[hydrotechnology]]. He had the grade of count of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] of the German Nation. For all his contributions he is rather a forgotten Russian hero.

==Early career==
Münnich was born at [[Berne, Germany|Neuenhuntorf]] in the Grand [[Duchy of Oldenburg]] in the military family of Anton Günther Mönnich (since 1688 ''von Münnich'', an east-Frisian nobility). Beside the knowledge of the native [[Low German language]] he also learned the [[Latin]] and [[French language]]s. At an early age (17 year old) he entered the French service. Thence he transferred successively to the armies of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] where he earned his title of a [[colonel]] and later [[Major General]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1721, he was invited by the Russian ambassador in [[Warsaw]] [[Grigoriy Dolgorukov]] for engineering projects of the newly acquired northern territories. Around that time his father has died. Upon arrival to Russia he presented [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] plans for the fortification of [[Kronstadt]] fortress, with which pleasantly surprised the Russian emperor, and the [[Annenkrone]] fortification in [[Vyborg]]. He was promoted to the [[Lieutenant General]] in 1722. Among his first undertakings was the completion of the costly [[Ladoga Canal]], which had been under construction for more than a decade. For his engineering and military-engineering achievements he was promoted to the rank of the [[General-in-Chief]] in 1726 by [[Catherine I]], and awarded the [[Order of St. Alexander Nevsky]]. In 1727, Münnich was appointed the Governor of [[Saint Petersburg]] city while the Imperial court was temporarily transferred to Moscow by [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. From 1728 to 1734 he was a General-Governor of [[Ingria]], [[Karelia]], and Finland as well as was awarded the title of a [[count]]. During his governorship Münnich improved the local ports, reinforced the newly established [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] (1703), and was thinking of building a bridge towards [[Stockholm]].

==Russian army reformer==
Upon the coronation of [[Anna of Russia]] (1730), he was instructed to prepare the city for the return of Imperial court. After successfully accomplishing that Münnich was promoted to a [[List of Russian field marshals|General-Fieldmarshal]], was appointed to the position of president of Russian [[War Collegiate]] in 1732 as well as given an order to re-organize the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]]. Münnich became a founder of the [[Leib-Guard Cavalry Regiment]], the [[Izmaylovsky Regiment]], and the Shlyakhetskiy [[Cadet Corps (Russia)|Cadet Corps]] which was destined to supply the future generations of officers. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Münnich also reformed numerous other military formations as well as the War Collegiate itself. He established a new formation for the Russian army at that time, the Corps which consisted of 12 regiments [[Cuirassier]] Cavalry as well as the first [[Hussar]] regiments. Münnich revised the table of ranks and evened the salary of the Russian officers with the invited foreign military specialists. He was the first to introduce the [[sapper]] regiments to the Russian army as well as founded the Engineer School for Officers. During his administration some 50 other fortresses were erected which substantially improved the well-being of the Russian Armed Forces at that time. Due to the [[Andrey Osterman]] affairs, he was released of his duties.

==Ottoman campaign of 1734-1739==
In 1734, by the reference of [[Ernst Johann von Biron]] he was sent to take the city of Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]) and after [[Siege of Danzig (1734)|a prolonged siege]] and evasion of [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] was heavily reproached. However, after that in 1733, the [[Russian Empire]] was able to install [[Augustus III of Poland]] as the King of Poland (ratified in 1736).

In 1736, as the Commander of the Russian army he headed the [[Russo-Turkish Wars|Turkish campaigns]] besieging the important ports of [[Azov|Azak]] and [[Ochakov|Özi]]. 
On May 21, 1735 he stormed and sacked [[Perekop|Or Qapı]] penetrating into the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] peninsula. 
Münnich destroyed the important Tatar cities of [[Kezlev]], [[Simferopol|Aqmescit]], and [[Bakhchisaray]]. 
He was forced out of the peninsula due to poor logistics and battle fatigue of his formations, while another General, Count [[Peter Lacy|Peter von Lacy]], took [[Azov|Azak]] earning himself a rank of the [[General-Fieldmarshal]]. 
Münnich refused to resume the campaign the very next year, but he returned to the lower [[Dnieper]] steppes in 1737, and on July 2 took the fortress of [[Ochakov|Özi]] with the help of the Russian artillery. 
During the sack of Özi, he manually raised the regimental banner of the Izmailovsky Regiment on one of the towers of fortress after a successful attack. 
The siege of Özi was also later mentioned in the humorous stories about [[Baron Munchausen]], based on the adventures of the [[page (servant)|page]] to [[Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick]], Hieronymus von Münchhausen. 
Due to the heavy losses, the campaign was paused again while conducting negotiations in [[Nemyriv|Nemirov]] ([[Podolie]]) without much result. 
In 1739, Münnich won the [[Battle of Stavuchany]], took [[Khotyn]] two days later, and established himself firmly in [[Moldavia]]. 
His victory in this campaign was later mentioned in one of the Lomonosov's odes, considered to be the first poem of Russian literature. Threatening to burn down the capital of [[Moldavia]], the city of [[Iași]], he forced the Moldavian boyars to sign the annexation of Moldavia. 
After the Ottoman war he was awarded the [[Order of St. Andrew]] and the Golden Weapon for Courage. 
Due to military losses of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] and worsening of the relationship with the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)|Swedish Hats]], the [[Russian Empire]] had to sign the [[Treaty of Niš (1739)|Treaty of Niš]] by which it had to return the newly acquired Nogai steppes while keeping the fortress of Azak.

Marshal Münnich now began to take an active part in political affairs, the particular tone of which was given by his rivalry with [[Ernst Johann von Biron|Biron]], [[duke]] of [[Courland]].
Münnich's activity was brought to a close by the [[Elizabeth of Russia|revolution of 1741]]; he was arrested on his way to the border, and condemned to death. Brought out for execution, and withdrawn from the [[Gallows|scaffold]], he was later sent to [[Pelym, Garinsky District, Sverdlovsk Oblast|Pelym]], [[Siberia]], where he remained for several years, until the accession of [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] brought about his release in 1762. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]], who soon displaced Peter, employed the old field marshal as director-general of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] ports.
Münnich died four years later in [[Tartu]] and was buried at his estate nearby, where his grave was damaged{{citation needed|reason=The desecration/damage should be sourced, presented without contradictions, and the approximate time given, at at least one of the places it is mentioned; cf the talk page|date=May 2015}} by the Soviets. The Russian [[37th Dragoons Regiment (Russia)|37th Dragoons Regiment]] used to bear his name.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
