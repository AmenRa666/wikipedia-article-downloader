[[File:USS LCS L 3 102 30Apr2016 450px.jpg|thumb|USS LCS (L) (3) 102 at Mare Island, California, 2016]]
'''USS LCS(L)(3)-102''' is an LCS(L)(3)-1 Class [[Landing Craft Support]] ship built for the [[United States Navy]] during World War II. The vessel was completed near the end of the war and saw brief service during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. After the war, ''LCS(L)(3)-102'' served in China before being decommissioned in 1946 and then transferred to Japan in mid-1953. Serving under the name JDS ''Himawari'', the vessel remained in Japan until mid-1966 when she was transferred to Thailand, becoming the HTMS ''Nakha''. In 2007, after being retired, the ship was returned to the United States to become museum ship.

== Design and construction ==

USS ''LCS(L)(3)-102'' was laid down 13 January 1945 at [[Commercial Iron Works]] in Portland, Oregon. The vessel was launched on 3 February 1945 and commissioned on 17 February.&lt;ref name=navsource&gt;{{cite web|title=USS LSSL-102|url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/05/050102.htm |publisher=NavSource Online |work=Amphibious Photo Archive |accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As built, the vessel displaced 250-tons without load, and 387 tons at full load. She was {{convert|158|ft|m}} long, with a beam of {{convert|28|ft|8|in|m}} and a draft of {{convert|5|ft|8|in|m}}. With a crew of six officers and 65 enlisted personnel, at maximum endurance she had a range of 5,500 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 12 knots; power was provided by two propellers that were driven by two General Motors 6-71 four-shaft 1,600 horse power diesel engines. She was armed with an array of weapons, including: a single 3-inch gun mounted on her bow; two twin-mounted 40mm anti-aircraft guns; four single-mounted 20mm anti-aircraft guns; four .50 caliber machine-guns and ten rocket launchers. Armor included {{convert|10|lb|adj=on}}  splinter shields which were placed on the gun mounts, the pilot house and the conning tower.&lt;ref name=navsource/&gt;&lt;ref name=memorials/&gt;

== Operational history ==

After commissioning, ''LCS(L)(3)-102'' was assigned to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater]] under the command of Captain J. M. Mc Issac. World War II was in its final stages at the time, but she arrived in time to participate in the [[Battle of Okinawa]], participating in the Gunto operation between 18 and 30 June 1945.&lt;ref name=navsource/&gt;&lt;ref name=memorials&gt;{{cite web|title=LCS-102  and  YTL-434: WWII Memorials |publisher=Navy Memorieshop.com|url=http://navy.memorieshop.com/LCS-102/index.html|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was pulled off line to perform mine removal in the Philippines, before doing the same in the Marshal Islands, Mariana Islands, and rivers in China.

At the end the end of the war, ''LCS(L)(3)-102'' served as part of the occupation forces in Japan until December 1945 when it was moved to China before being deemed surplus and decommissioned in April 1946 and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Columbia River Group, in Astoria, Oregon. Redesignated Landing Ship Support Large, USS ''LSSL-102'', on 28 February 1949 she was soon transferred to Japan, 30 April 1953, and renamed JDS ''Himawari'' where she served until 18 April 1966 when she was brought to the US, re-transferred to Thailand and renamed HTMS ''Nakha'' (LSSL-751). She stayed in Thailand until 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;navsource&quot; /&gt;

== Fate ==

In September 2007, she was loaded aboard a ship for transit from Thailand back to the United States to become a [[Museum Ship|museum ship]] at [[Mare Island, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mareislandhpf.org/ships.html |title=Mare Island Historic Park Foundation|publisher= |accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Last WW II Landing Craft Support Ship Still Afloat in Vallejo, Calif.|url=http://photos.mercurynews.com/2013/09/11/photos-last-ww-ii-landing-craft-support-ship-still-afloat-in-vallejo-calif/|newspaper=Contra Costa Times|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; USS ''LCS(L)(3)-102'' earned one [[battle star]] for her service in World War II.&lt;ref name=navsource/&gt;  She was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2015.
