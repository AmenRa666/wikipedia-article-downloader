== Odd phrasing + seemingly apocryphal anecdotes ==

Anyone else think that the last paragraph of the first invasion section is oddly phrased. I would change it, but I simply do not know what was even intended. The anecdote mentioned sounds almost apocryphal and its source should probably be confirmed. Finally, shouldn't the rise of Zen Buddhism actually be in the significance section and not that of the first invasion which should more properly cover the actual military events?

7 November 2005
There is an interesting program on the Discovery Times channel entitled &quot;Kublai Khan:  Fall of the Mongol Hordes&quot; about the invasion of 1281.  The program is based on the work of a Japanese underwater archaeologist.

An examination of pieces of the ships found on the sea bottom reveals that the craftsmanship of the ships was not very good, not as normal.  The implication is that the Chinese shipbuilders wanted to sabotage the mission and/or that Kublai Khan was in such a hurry to invade Japan that he didn't give the shipbuilders enough time to do the job properly.  Consequently, in the typhoon, the ships broke up.

Further, most or all of the pieces recovered from the bottom were for riverboats, not for ocean-going ships with keels.  The riverboats did not have keels, and would easily turn over in a storm.

Incidentally, they found one of the bombs as in the picture on the ocean floor.  They would have been launched from catapults on the ships.

The program speculates that the defeat of the Mongols at that time would have led people on the continent to see that the Mongols could be defeated, thus encouraging subjugated peoples that they too might be able to successfully oppose the Mongols. (??)

:I thought most Chinese ocean-going vessels didn't have a keel either but a flat bottom instead. Is that wrong? ([[User:82.135.66.208|82.135.66.208]] 18:15, 19 March 2006 (UTC))

== Invasions of Japan ==

See the ''Invasions of Japan'' section at [[Kublai Khan]]. Some of that information can update what's in the current article. [[User:Adraeus|Adraeus]] 23:40, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

Someone who knows how (I don't) should change the linked reference to &quot;mongol compound bows&quot;.  The Mongols did not have &quot;compound&quot; bows.  Those are a late 20th century invention.  The Mongols had &quot;composite recurve bows&quot; (so did the Tatars, Turks, people of India and others).  The difference is VERY important technically.[[User:24.10.102.46|24.10.102.46]] 03:01, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

I was reading this article and clicked a refrence to the Battle of bun'ei, and I noticed a discrepency: This article states that the Mongols outnumbered the Samurai, and the article [[Battle of Bun'ei]] states they Mongols were badly outnumbered by the Samurai. I was wondering which is right? [[User:Caris42|Caris42]] 20:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
::Ah, another very important point that I somehow missed. I shall look into this tomorrow. Thank you for pointing it out. [[User:LordAmeth|LordAmeth]] 23:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

== POV ==

&quot;... due to their role in setting a limit on Mongol expansion, are arguably crucial events to world history as a whole.&quot;

Mongol Expansion had failed in other regions of the world before the invasion of Japan.

For example, in the [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam]], first attempt failed in [[1258]], the 2 others later also failed too. The limit of Monggol expansion in the south direction, therefore, had been set at Vietnam-China border, indepedently and before Japan attacks. In fact, one attack to Japan was cancelled because of Mongol's resource redirected to Vietnam attempt (which were all failed). In this particular case, the failure in Japan is not a major cause (&quot;their role in setting a limit&quot;) but rather a result from other Mongol activities in other regions (explicitly, Vietnam).

I think the introduction should be changed to reflect a more global view of the &quot;world history&quot;. It is writing about &quot;world history&quot; viewed in the Japan eye.[[User:134.157.170.125|134.157.170.125]] 11:07, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

:I know how Vietnam fought against Chinese expansion, not only against Mongolian dinasty.  Actually I respect this.  The best way for you is to create and enhance the acticle of [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam]].  After that, we can review these articles and modify them adequately.  --[[User:Corruptresearcher|Corruptresearcher]] 13:10, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== In Little Need of Divine Intervention reference ==

Hi!

I had previously referenced Thomas Conlan's [[http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/eastasia/CEASbooks/item.asp?id=44 work]] on the Mongol invasions of Japan (whcih included a translation and line art reproduction of the Moko Shurai Ekotoba), as well as provided a [[http://www.fukuokahistory.com/live/content/view/38/52 link]] to an essay from said book, in which Professor Conlan disputes the 'divine wind' explanation for the repulsion of the Mongol invasions of 1274 and 1281. 

While I had perhaps been a bit clunky with my previous contribution, I feel that without reference to the book in question (which is also a useful source of English translations of relevant Kamakura-era documents) the reasons for disputing the numbers involved in the invasion - or for the success or failure of the Japanese in resisting the Mongols in theatre - are not adequately presented.

Could it be possible to include a reference to the title in question - as well as separate the issue of the debate from the Aftermath sub-section? --[[User:Nerroth|Nerroth]] 23:53, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

::I don't think there is any need to separate out the debate, as I phrased it as such, writing &quot;Though it is not universally agreed upon, many scholars today believe...&quot; This is a phrasing that quite clearly indicates that there is a debate, and that the ideas presented here are not the &quot;facts&quot; as seen from only one point of view, but are ideas that are very much still not agreed upon by scholars.

::George Sansom, my primary source, and a rather well-known and respected expert on Japanese medieval history, writes: &quot;Against these handicaps &lt;nowiki&gt;[those of Mongol tactics and technology] the resistance of the Japanese was ineffective and it was only their courage that allowed them to hold out until nightfall ... however, the Japanese were by no means defeated, since given time they could overwhelm the Mongols by superior numbers&quot; (History of Japan to 1334, p 443). A few pages later, in reference to the second invasion, he writes: &quot;How long the Japanese could have kept up this desperate and stubborn fighting we cannot tell; but it is clear that from June 23 to August 14, a space of over seven weeks, the long line from Munakata well into Hizen province was firmly held&quot; (p 449). So, the Japanese certainly were at a great disadvantage, but I think that the claims of whether or not they could have survived without the kamikaze are quite debateable - they had plenty of time to prepare for the second attack, they had the courage and fighting spirit of the samurai (just look at half the WWII battles where we fought the Japanese and you'll see something of the difficulty in opposing their fighting spirit) and the katana, one of the greatest styles of sword ever invented. Perhaps most importantly, they had far superior numbers to the Mongol invaders.

::More to the point, while Prof Conlan may be on to something, and may make some very good points, that doesn't change the fact that the core majority of academia and books on the subject represent the events a particular way. In scholarship, just about every topic under the sun has detractors; that is, there are papers, perfectly valid papers that make good points based on solid research, arguing against nearly every conventional theory of nearly everything one could possibly study. It doesn't mean that the conventional belief is entirely overturned.

::As for the other matter, I think it ought to go without saying that medieval chronicles cannot always be trusted for the numbers involved. These were written, more often than not, as epic tales or the like, tales of bravery and courage and not intended as accurate historical descriptions. Just like the Bible and the Iliad, these stories were written to tell a story, and to express or teach a message, such as that of bravery and courage. No one present could have or would have accurately counted heads, anyway. A giant, imposing alien force from across the seas would be represented as such, its numbers exaggerated by the pure force and intimidation factor they exuded, as would the defending force. I hope that helps clear things up somewhat. ~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;


:::How would them having the &quot;greatest styles of sword ever invented&quot; make any differance if their enemy had superior bows and could catapult explosives at them?  Did the Japanese fight mostly with bows, or did they run around with swords?  Also, the records of how many Mongols died comes from the Mongols themselves, they certainly having no reason to exaggerate things.  They knew how many people got loaded onto their ships, and how few came back.

== Possible exceptions ==

Hi. I don't normally like to nitpick, and I apologize. But the phrase referring to World War II as a &quot;possible exception&quot; was quite intentionally phrased that way. Operations Olympic and Coronet were never undertaken, and the Home Islands were never invaded, unless one counts the Occupation. Thus, whether it counts as an exception or not is not decided. [[User:LordAmeth|LordAmeth]] 02:16, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;Khubilai Khan: Fall of the Mongol Hordes&quot; ==

In this [[Discovery Channel]] documentary some fragments of the Mongol ships, as retrieved by Japanese archaeologists, are examined. It turns out that, in his haste to launch the invasion, Khubilai used a great number of shabby river boats that could not survive a [[taifun]]. They called the ensuing catastrophe the greatest in the history of naval warfare, claiming the lives of ca. 70,000 people. Perhaps the article should be updated accordingly. --[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirla]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Ghirlandajo|-трёп-]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:11, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

== The second invasion bit doesn't tell of numbers.  Also, what weapons were used by both sides? ==

Shouldn't the part about the second invasion mention how many were reported to be involved?  The Mongols would've kept records on how many soldiers they lost.

I am also curious about how the Japanese fought back.  Did they actually run around with katanas, hoping to get close enough to their enemy to slice off a head, before being shot to death by bows and catapulted explosives?  How did the Mongol arrows stand up to Japanese shields and body armor?  Did the Japanese have phalanx shield formations to protect them?  Did the use formations of pikemen to intercept arrows, as they charged forward to their enemy?  Did the ruling elite send vast numbers of peasant farmers forward to wear out the enemy, before rushing in with a proper military force to fight?  Or did the Japanese fight mainly with bows of their own, which even if not as good as the Mongol's bows(I haven't googled around for a comparison chart yet) would've given them an advantage with their superior numbers.  I believe with their culture, they could rally a lot of people to fight at a moment's notice easily enough.
[[User:Dream Focus|Dream Focus]] 05:40, 26 July 2007 (UTC)

My understanding of medieval Japanese warfare has it that the majority of Japanese troops were spearmen and bowmen, though perhaps there was an exception at this battle. [[Special:Contributions/207.5.159.199|207.5.159.199]] ([[User talk:207.5.159.199|talk]]) 07:49, 23 October 2009 (UTC)

 And there were no katanas in the time of Mongol İnvasion. Most of the things associated with the image of classical era samurai (arms and armor, bushido, budo etc.)were created or perfected much after the Mongol İnvasion. On the other hand, Mongols were battle hardened experienced cavalry wariors who fought in perfect harmony and had superior equipment with their cavalry sabers, composite bows and explosives. To be honest only thing saved Japan from invasion was the bad weather(not once but twice horrible typhoons)and poor sailing skills of Mongols.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/85.102.204.159|85.102.204.159]] ([[User talk:85.102.204.159|talk]]) 04:49, 7 January 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Kublai's letter in 1266 ==

Kublai Khan's letter to Japan in 1266 never says something like &quot;as king of Japan under the Mongol Khan&quot; or &quot;Goryeo render thanks for my rule&quot;. Instead, it stated &quot;let's enter into friendly relations with each other; nobody would with to resort to arms&quot; and &quot;Goryeo, as my eastern tributary, renders thanks for my ceasefire and restoring their land and people when I ascended the throne&quot;.--[[Special:Contributions/209.90.146.162|209.90.146.162]] ([[User talk:209.90.146.162|talk]]) 03:19, 29 August 2008 (UTC)

== Second Invasion ==
I have removed a couple of sentences that are such bad English that I'm not even sure what they're trying to say: &quot; And Goryeo built ships on her own type. According to Goryeosa, [[Southern Song]] type ships are too cost and too late for due date, so build on my own type.'' --&gt; Goryeosa 『高麗史』列伝巻十七 「若依蛮様則工費多将不及期」「用本國船様督造」http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/BIImgFrame.php?JP_NUM=50001638&amp;VOL_NUM=00003&amp;KOMA=125&amp;ITYPE=0  [[User:Cerowyn|Cerowyn]] ([[User talk:Cerowyn|talk]]) 01:01, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

Well, somebody put them back. I'm guessing the writer was trying to say that sea-worthy vessels from the Southern Song region of China were too costly and would take too long to build, which is why they used river vessels. Rather than remove them again, somebody who reads the original language (It appears to be Japanese, but I'm not sure) and writes English well should read the source and provide a better translation. —[[User:MiguelMunoz|MiguelMunoz]] ([[User talk:MiguelMunoz|talk]]) 09:07, 31 March 2009 (UTC)

== Invasion vs conquest ==

In addition, with the exception of the Occupation of Japan at the end of World War II, these failed invasion attempts are the closest Japan has come to being '''invasion''' within the last 1500 years.

I have changed the second &quot;invasion&quot; in the sentence to conquered. Invasion being closest to Japan being invaded? It doesn't make sense. Japan was invaded by the Mongols twice, just not conquered.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Miyashita|Miyashita]] ([[User talk:Miyashita|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Miyashita|contribs]]) 06:02, 4 September 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== WP: Japan Re-Assessment Commentary ==

I downgraded the assessment for WP: Japan as well as WP: Military History. I found References lacking at several points. Coverage was also deficient, but a short section should fix it. The Mongol invasions of Japan were costly, and none of the samurai rulers wanted to bear the costs alone. Between the first and second invasions, the shogunate helped finance defensive coastal outposts in Kyushu, and helped pay the men who kept watch. The warriors of the Tohoku region were favored for this duty, and they earned respect for their vigilance. However, all these costs weakened the shogunate and contributed to its eventual downfall. If I can find sources, I'll be happy to include this in the text, because coverage won't be complete until this is mentioned.

== Numbers ==

500 troops invasion in 1274?!? (23000 headed to Japan, 22500 lost to the sea). Seems like an easy victory for Japan and hardly could be called as 'invasion' by numbers. [[Special:Contributions/213.221.17.130|213.221.17.130]] ([[User talk:213.221.17.130|talk]]) 13:24, 8 November 2013 (UTC)

== article is sorely needing English translations of sources, copyrights, page numbers ...... ==

This article is way out of spec with the Wiki guidelines and appears to have been for a long time.  This is the ''English'' Wikipedia, and we need English sources unless a unique piece of information can only be found in another RS that is not in English.  This is for verification purposes, etc., etc.  The Mongol Invasions of Japan are very well documented in a number of English sources and this needs to be addressed.  [[User:HammerFilmFan|HammerFilmFan]] ([[User talk:HammerFilmFan|talk]]) 13:22, 25 January 2015 (UTC)

== Military Significance Section ==

The opening paragraph of this article is rather unclear, I think. It states that this invasion was one of only three instances, but it's not completely clear what it was an instance of. I think it's trying to say that it was one of three wars between Japanese samurai and foreign forces, but I'm not absolutely sure. If someone can confirm this, I'd like to reword it slightly. It also might be better to refer to them as two of four rather than one of three, since they are separate invasions (albeit strongly linked) or simply leave out mention of later invasions altogether, since they don't seem relevant as they occurred centuries later. If they are being mentioned, for what reason are conflicts from the 1900s excluded? And if they are being mentioned, why not a raid in 1019 by Jurchen Pirates? Is the fact that these four conflicts occurred during the era when Japan's military was based around the samurai particularly important? It kinda comes across as fluff.--[[User:Mr Bucket|Mr Bucket]] ([[User talk:Mr Bucket|talk]]) 02:16, 26 May 2016 (UTC)

== More detail in Battles sections ==
