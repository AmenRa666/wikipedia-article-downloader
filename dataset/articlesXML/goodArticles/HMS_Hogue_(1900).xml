{{otherships|HMS Hogue}}

'''HMS ''Hogue''''' was a {{sclass-|Cressy|cruiser|0}} [[armoured cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] around 1900. Upon completion she was assigned to the [[Channel Fleet]] and the [[China Station]]. In 1906 she became a [[training ship]] for the [[North America and West Indies Station]] before being placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in 1908. [[Ship commissioning|Recommissioned]] at the start of World War I, she played a minor role in the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] a few weeks after the beginning of the war. ''Hogue'' was sunk by the German [[submarine]] [[SM U-9|''U-9'']], together with two of her [[sister ship]]s, [[Action of 22 September 1914|on 22 September 1914]]. Unlike her sisters, only 48 of her crew were killed in the attack.

==Design and description==
''Hogue'' was designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|12000|LT|t}}. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|472|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|69|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a deep [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|26|ft|9|in|m|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2012, pp. 335–36&lt;/ref&gt; She was powered by two 4-cylinder [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of {{convert|21,000|ihp|lk=in|-1}} using steam provided by 30 [[Belleville boiler]]s. The engines were designed to give a maximum speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}, although ''Hogue'' reached {{convert|22.06|kn}} with {{convert|21432|ihp}} on her [[sea trial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; She carried a maximum of {{convert|1600|LT|t}} of coal and her complement ranged from 725&lt;ref name=f6&gt;Friedman 2012, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; to 760 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=ck8&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Her main armament consisted of two [[List_of_British_ordnance_terms#BL|breech-loading]] (BL) [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX - X|{{convert|9.2|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} Mk X guns]] in single [[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft of the superstructure.&lt;ref name=f6/&gt; They fired {{convert|380|lb|adj=on}} shells to a range of {{convert|15500|yd}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2011, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Her secondary armament of twelve [[BL 6-inch Mk VII naval gun|BL 6-inch Mk VII guns]] was arranged in [[casemate]]s amidships. Eight of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2012, pp. 243, 260–61&lt;/ref&gt; They had a maximum range of approximately {{convert|12200|yd}} with their {{convert|100|lb|adj=on}} shells.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2011, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; A dozen [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder 12 cwt guns]] were fitted for defence against [[torpedo boat]]s, eight on casemates on the upper deck and four in the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2012, pp. 243, 336&lt;/ref&gt; The ship also carried three [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|3-pounder]] [[Hotchkiss gun]]s and two submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=ck8/&gt;

The ship's [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|armour belt]] had a maximum thickness of {{convert|6|in|0}} and was closed off by {{convert|5|in|adj=on|0}} transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s. The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while the casemate armour was 5 inches thick. The protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] armour ranged in thickness from {{convert|1|-|3|in|mm|0}} and the conning tower was protected by {{convert|12|in|0}} of armour.&lt;ref name=ck8/&gt;

==Construction and service ==
[[File:Launching of the HMS Hogue (1900).jpg|thumb|left|Launching of ''Hogue'', 1900]]
''Hogue'', named after the 1692 [[Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue|Battle of La Hogue]], was [[Keel|laid down]] on 14 July 1898 by [[Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim, Ltd|Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim]] at their [[Barrow-in-Furness]] [[shipyard]] and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 13 August 1900.&lt;ref name=s9&gt;Silverstone, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived at [[Plymouth Dockyard|Plymouth]] to begin [[fitting out]] in September 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military Intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=16 September 1901 |page_number=8 |issue=36561| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced her sea trials in early December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=4 December 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36629| }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hogue'' was completed on 19 November 1902 and assigned to the Channel Fleet under the command of Commander Algernon Walker Heneage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Friday |date=18 July 1902 |page_number=9 |issue=36823| }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March 1904 she collided with the merchant ship {{SS|Meurthe}} off [[Europa Point]]. Later that year she was transferred to the China Station after a refit.&lt;ref name=s9/&gt; 

Two years later ''Hogue'' became the boys' training ship for the [[4th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|4th Cruiser Squadron]] on the North America and West Indies Station. She was reduced to reserve at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] in 1908 and then assigned to the reserve Third Fleet at the [[Nore]] the next year. On 26 November 1909 a coal bunker explosion killed two crewmen. The ship received a lengthy refit at [[Chatham Dockyard]] in 1912–13 and was assigned to the [[7th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|7th Cruiser Squadron]] shortly after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2012, p. 241; Silverstone, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron was tasked with patrolling the [[Broad Fourteens]] of the [[North Sea]] in support of a force of [[destroyer]]s and [[submarine]]s based at [[Harwich Dockyard|Harwich]] which protected the eastern end of the [[English Channel]] from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between [[United Kingdom|England]] and [[France]]. During the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August, the ship was part of Cruiser Force 'C', in reserve off the Dutch coast, and saw no action.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, pp. 100, 171–72&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hogue'' did, however, tow the heavily damaged [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Arethusa|1913|2}}, [[flagship]] of the commander of the [[Harwich Force]], [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Reginald Tyrwhitt]], back to port after the battle was over.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate===
{{Main|Action of 22 September 1914}}
[[File:Action of 22 September 1914 - EN.svg|thumb|left|Scheme]]

[[File:SM U9 Postcard.jpg|thumb|Victories of ''U-9'' on a postcard]]
On the morning of 22 September, ''Hogue'' and her sisters, {{HMS|Aboukir|1900|2}} and {{HMS|Cressy|1899|2}}, were on patrol without any escorting destroyers as they had been forced to seek shelter from bad weather. The three sisters were in [[line abreast]], about {{convert|2000|yd}} apart, at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. They were not expecting submarine attack, but they had lookouts posted and had one gun manned on each side to attack any submarines sighted. The weather had moderated earlier that morning and Tyrwhitt was en route to reinforce the cruisers with eight destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, pp. 172–75&lt;/ref&gt; 

''U-9'', commanded by ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' [[Otto Weddigen]], had been ordered to attack British transports at [[Ostend]], but had been forced to dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at ''Aboukir'' that struck her on the starboard side; the ship's [[captain (nautical)|captain]] thought he had struck a [[naval mine|mine]] and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. ''Aboukir'' quickly began [[list (watercraft)|listing]] and [[capsized]] around 06:55. As ''Hogue'' approached her sinking sister, [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Wilmot Nicholson]] realized that it had been a submarine attack and signalled ''Cressy'' to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on ''Aboukir'' as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water. Having stopped and lowered all her boats, ''Hogue'' was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused ''U-9'' to broach the surface and ''Hogue''{{'}}s gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again. The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed as all of her watertight doors had been open and sank at 07:15.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, pp. 133–35&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cressy'' attempted to ram the submarine, but did not hit anything and resumed her rescue efforts until she too was torpedoed at 07:20. She too took on a heavy list and then capsized before sinking at 07:55. Several Dutch ships began rescuing survivors at 08:30 and were joined by British fishing trawlers before Tyrwhitt and his ships arrived at 10:45. The combined total from all three ships was 837 men rescued and 62 officers and 1,397 enlisted men lost.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, ''Hogue'' lost a total of 48 men.&lt;ref name=s9/&gt;

In 1954 the British government sold the salvage rights to all three ships to a German company and they were subsequently sold again to a Dutch salvage company which began salvaging the wrecks' metal in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011 |title=Booty Trawl |journal=Private Eye |issue=1302 |page=31 |publisher=Pressdram}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/10/12/uk-britain-ships-graves-idUKTRE79B50320111012|title=Scrap metal hunt is wrecking UK warship graves - veterans|last=Ambrogi|first=Stefano|date=12 October 2011|work=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
