'''Isaac Smith''' (1752&amp;ndash;1831) was a [[Rear Admiral]] in the [[Royal Navy]] and cousin of the wife of Captain [[James Cook]], with whom he sailed on two voyages of exploration in the South Pacific. Smith was the first European to set foot in eastern [[Australia]] and the first to prepare survey maps of various Pacific islands and coastlines including [[Tierra del Fuego]] in South America.

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[London]] in 1752, the eldest of seven children of Charles and Hannah Smith and cousin to James Cook's wife Elizabeth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robson&quot;&gt;Robson 2009, pp. 175-176&lt;/ref&gt; He enlisted for naval service in 1767 at the age of thirteen, using his family connections to secure an immediate ranking of [[Able seaman (rank)#Royal Navy|able seaman]] and a position aboard [[HMS Grenville (1754)|HMS ''Grenville'']] under Cook's command, for a survey voyage off the west coast of Newfoundland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robson&quot;/&gt; On 27 May 1768, and still ranked able seaman, he transferred to his second vessel, Cook's [[HMS Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], at Deptford&lt;ref name=&quot;Beaglehole590&quot;&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 590&lt;/ref&gt; ahead of its expedition to the Pacific to observe the 1769 [[Transit of Venus]]&lt;ref&gt;Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and then to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (or &quot;unknown southern land&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Secret Instructions to Lieutenant Cook 30&amp;nbsp;July 1768 (UK) |publisher=National Library of Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |accessdate=26 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific exploration===

{{main|First voyage of James Cook}}
Smith sailed with Cook to [[Tahiti]], then to [[New Zealand]] and the east coast of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Blainey 2008, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; On &lt;!-- civil date--&gt;28 April 1770 he became the first European to set foot on eastern Australian soil, Cook telling him &quot;Jump out, Isaac&quot; as the ship's boat touched the shore at Botany Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Maclean |first =Donald |title =Coasting With Cook: A Cruise in Historic Waters | work =The Argus | page =9 | publisher =Argus Office, Melbourne Victoria | date =5 August 1933 | url =http://ndpbeta.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/4753582?searchTerm=isaac+smith+cook+endeavour | accessdate =20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later on 23 May 1770, Smith was promoted to [[midshipman]] following [[James Magra]]'s suspension on suspicion of having assaulted Cook's clerk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beaglehole590&quot;/&gt;

Cook's lieutenant [[Zachary Hicks]] died from [[tuberculosis]] in May 1771, and was replaced by the [[master's mate]] [[Charles Clerke]]. In turn, Smith was promoted to fill Clerke's former role and served with distinction for the remainder of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Cook singled him out in a letter to the [[Secretary of the Admiralty]] in 1772, noting that Smith &quot;had been of great use to me in assisting to make Surveys, Drawings &amp;c in which he is very expert.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cook, James, Admiralty 1/1609, cited in Hough 1994, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith sailed again with Cook in 1772, as master's mate aboard the [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']].&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; He assisted first mate Joseph Gilbert in drawing Cook's maps and survey charts during the voyage, including one of the first recorded maps of Tierra del Fuego in 1773.&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's wider artistic talents were also demonstrated by the production of a small [[watercolour]] of icebergs, painted while ''Resolution'' sailed close to [[Antarctica]] in 1773.&lt;ref&gt;Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; On ''Resolution''{{'}}s return Cook again singled Smith out for praise, advising Admiralty that he was &quot;a Young man bred to the Sea under my care and who has been a very great assistant to me in [making charts], both in this and my former voyage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Captain James Cook, R.N to the Admiralty Secretary, 24 May 1775, cited in Robson 2009, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent command===
On ''Resolution''′s return to England in 1775, Smith was promoted to lieutenant and given command of the elderly 16-gun [[sloop]] {{HMS|Weazel|1745|6}}, holding this post for two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beaglehole590&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1787, he was promoted to [[post-captain]] in command of the 36-gun frigate HMS ''Perseverance.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Urban178&quot;&gt;Urban 1831, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; The future Admiral [[John Surman Carden]] was a member of Smith's crew from 1787 to 1793, before his transfer to the [[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS ''Marlborough'']]. As captain of ''Perseverance'', Smith was assigned to the [[East Indies Station]] under the overall command of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Urban178&quot;/&gt; and took part in the capture at sea of the French frigate [[French frigate Résolue (1778)|Résolue]] in 1791 at the [[Battle of Tellicherry]], shortly before the outbreak of the first [[French Revolutionary War]].

==Later life==
Despite this achievement and continued commendation from his superiors, Smith's active service days were drawing to a close. In 1794 he contracted [[hepatitis]], and his ill health gradually prevented him from performing his duties. In either 1804&lt;ref&gt;Besant 2009, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; or 1807&lt;ref name=&quot;Urban178&quot;/&gt; he applied for and received a promotion to the superannuated post of [[Rear Admiral]] and returned to England to retire.

In initial retirement Smith shared a house in Clapham with his cousin, Cook's widow Elizabeth, until in the 1820s he inherited [[Merton Priory|Merton Abbey]] in Merton, Surrey, from his brother in law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urban178&quot;/&gt; He then divided his time between these two homes, until his death on 2 July 1831 at the age of 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Maritime Memorials | publisher =National Maritime Museum (UK) | year =2009 | url =http://www.nmm.ac.uk/memorials/Memorial.cfm?Banner=5&amp;MemorialPage=7&amp;MemorialID=M5555&amp;Full=Transcript | accessdate =20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His will left a sum of £700 to the church of St Mary the Virgin in Merton, the interest from which was to support the poor of the parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =A Topographical Dictionary of England: Mersea, East - Methwold  | first =Samuel | last =Lewis (ed.) | year =1848 | publisher =Institute of Historical Research | pages =295–298 | url = | isbn =}} cited in {{cite web| title =British History Online | publisher =University of London &amp; History of Parliament Trust | year =2009 | url =http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51145 | accessdate =19 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial to Smith, originally financed by Elizabeth Cook, stands in the church grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =St. Mary the Virgin | publisher =Merton Council (UK)|date=December 2006 | url =http://www.merton.gov.uk/leisure/history-heritage/heritage-sites/stmarythevirgin.htm | accessdate =20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
