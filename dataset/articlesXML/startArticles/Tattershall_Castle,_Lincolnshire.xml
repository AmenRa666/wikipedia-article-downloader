[[File:Tattershall Castle, 2006.jpg|right|240px|upright|thumbnail|Great Tower of Tattershall Castle showing the three separate entrances]]
'''Tattershall Castle''' is a [[castle]] in [[Tattershall]], [[Lincolnshire]], England, about 12&amp;nbsp;miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) north east of [[Sleaford]]. It is in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

==History==

Tattershall Castle has its origins in either a stone [[castle]] or a fortified [[manor house]], built by Robert de Tattershall in 1231.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book|title=Tattershall Castle Guide|year=1974|publisher=The National Trust|author=Dr M. W. Thompson|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was largely rebuilt in brick, and greatly expanded, by [[Ralph de Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell|Ralph, 3rd Lord Cromwell]], [[Treasurer of England]], between 1430 and 1450.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; 

Brick castles are less common in England than stone or earth and timber constructions; when brick was chosen as a building material it was often for its aesthetic appeal or because it was fashionable. The trend for using bricks was introduced by Flemish weavers. There was plenty of stone available nearby, but Cromwell chose to use brick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adrian&quot;/&gt; About 700,000&amp;nbsp;bricks were used to build the castle, which has been described as &quot;the finest piece of medieval brick-work in England&quot;.&lt;ref name=Adrian&gt;{{cite web|title=English Castles: A Guide by Counties|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|author=Adrian Pettifer|pages=145–7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Friar|2003|pp=38–40.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Lord Cromwell's castle, the 130&amp;nbsp;foot (40&amp;nbsp;metre) high&lt;ref name=NT&gt;{{cite web|title=Tattershall Castle|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-tattershallcastle/w-tattershallcastle-brief_history.htm|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Tower and [[moat]] still remain. It is thought that the castle's three state rooms were once splendidly fitted out and the chambers were heated by immense [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] fireplaces with decorated chimney pieces and [[tapestries]]. It has been said that the castle was an early domestic country mansion masquerading as a fortress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adrian&quot;/&gt; Cromwell died in 1456, and the castle was initially inherited by his niece, [[Joan Bouchier]], but it was confiscated by the Crown after her husband's demise.&lt;ref name=NT/&gt; Tattershall Castle was recovered in 1560 by [[Sir Henry Sidney]], who sold it to Lord Clinton, later [[Earl of Lincoln]], and it remained with the Earls of Lincoln until 1693.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; It passed to the Fortesques,&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; but then fell into neglect.

It was put up for sale in 1910. Its greatest treasures, the huge medieval fireplaces, were still intact. When an American bought them they were ripped out and packaged up for shipping. [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon of Kedleston]] stepped in at the eleventh hour to buy the castle and was determined to get the fireplaces back. After a nationwide hunt they were found in London and returned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21587468&lt;/ref&gt; He restored the castle &lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adrian&quot;/&gt; and left it to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] on his death in 1925.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; Lord Curzon had undertaken restorations on it between 1911 and 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adrian&quot;/&gt; It remains today one of the three most important surviving brick castles of the mid-15th century.&lt;ref name=NT/&gt;

The experience of Tattershall led Lord Curzon to push for heritage protection law in Britain; this was enacted as the [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913]].

==Design==
The plan of the castle is roughly rectangular; it is bounded by an inner [[moat]] surrounded by an outer moat.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; The inner enclosure, or Ward, was that of the original 13th-century castle, and the original entrance was on the north side towards the west end.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

The Outer Ward, between the outer moat and inner moat, housed the stables.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; The Middle Ward, originally accessed by a bridge from the Outer Ward, housed a [[gatehouse]] and [[guardhouse]]. Today, access to the castle is via this Middle Ward.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; The Inner Moat encompases the Inner Ward, where the Great Tower and the kitchens (now demolished) were situated.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

===The Great Tower===
[[File:Tapestry Room - geograph.org.uk - 525495.jpg|thumb|interior of Tattershall Castle]]
The tower is about {{convert|20|m|ft|disp=flip}} across. There are separate entrances to the basement, to the ground floor (Parlour), and to the spiral staircase leading to the upper floors of the tower. This suggests that the basement and ground floor were intended to provide communal accommodation, while the three great upper rooms were an independent private suite. The design was extremely simple, with four floors, slightly increasing in size at each level by reductions in wall thickness.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;
The fireplaces indicate that the rooms were not intended to be subdivided, but were kept as one great room at each level. One of the four corner turrets contains the staircase, but the other three provided extra accommodation rooms at each level.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

The basement was used to store spices and other kitchen items. It is believed that during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] it was used as a prison.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

The ground floor was the Parlour and it was here that local tenants would come to pay their rent.&lt;ref name=NT/&gt; Today, the Parlour is licensed for civil wedding ceremonies for up to 90 guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castles of England|url=http://www.castlestories.net/England/Lincolnshire/Tattershall-Castle.html|publisher=Castles of England|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Council/&gt;

The first floor of the private suite was the Hall, which would have been used to entertain and wine and dine guests.&lt;ref name=NT/&gt;

The second floor was the Audience Chamber, and only the finest of guests would have been admitted here. A brick vaulted corridor led to a small waiting room, before the great hall of the Audience Chamber, which today houses [[Flemish]] [[tapestries]] bought by Lord Curzon.&lt;ref name=NT/&gt;

The third floor would have been the Private Chamber, where the Lord would have retired for the night.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

Above these are the roof gallery and [[battlements]], which provide good views across the Lincolnshire landscape, as far as [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]] to the south, and [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] to the north.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; It is not possible today to access the turrets.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

The brick foundations to the south of the great tower, projecting into the moat, mark the site of the 15th-century kitchens.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

Today, the old guardhouse (about {{convert|100|m|ft|disp=flip}} north-east of the tower) is the gift shop, and the grounds are home to a number of [[peafowl|peacocks]].&lt;ref name=Council&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincolnshire County Council|url=http://www.lincolnshire.gov.uk/residents/births-marriages-deaths-and-civil-partnerships/getting-married/approved-venues-and-venue-licensing/licensed-venues-in-lincolnshire/tattershall/|publisher=Lincolnshire County Council|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
