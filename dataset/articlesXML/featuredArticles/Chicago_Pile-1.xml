'''Chicago Pile-1''' ('''CP-1'''), when it achieved [[Criticality (status)|criticality]], became the world's first artificial [[nuclear reactor]]. Its construction was part of the [[Manhattan Project]], the Allied effort to create [[atomic bomb]]s during [[World War II]]. It was built by the Manhattan Project's [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the [[University of Chicago]], under the west viewing stands of the original [[Stagg Field]]. The first human-made self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] was initiated in CP-1 on 2 December 1942, under the supervision of [[Enrico Fermi]], who described the apparatus as &quot;a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers&quot;.{{sfn|Fermi|1982|p=24}}

The reactor was assembled in November 1942, by a team that included Fermi, [[Leo Szilard]], discoverer of the chain reaction, and [[Herbert L. Anderson]], [[Walter Zinn]], [[Martin D. Whitaker]], and [[George Weil]]. It contained 45,000 [[graphite]] blocks weighing {{convert|400|ST}} used as [[neutron moderator]]s, and was fueled by {{convert|6|ST}} of uranium metal and {{convert|50|ST}} of uranium oxide. In the pile, some of the free neutrons produced by the natural decay of uranium were absorbed by other uranium atoms, causing [[nuclear fission]] of those atoms, and the release of additional free neutrons. Unlike most subsequent nuclear reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system as it only operated at very low power. The shape of the pile was intended to be roughly spherical, but as work proceeded Fermi calculated that critical mass could be achieved without finishing the entire pile as planned.

In 1943, CP-1 was moved to [[Red Gate Woods]], and reconfigured to become Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). There, it was operated until 1954, when it was dismantled and buried. The stands at Stagg Field were demolished in August 1957, but the site is now a [[National Historic Landmark]] and a [[Chicago Landmark]].

==Origins==
The idea of [[chemical]] [[chain reaction]]s was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist [[Max Bodenstein]] for a situation in which two molecules react to form not just the final reaction products, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the original substances to cause more to react.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/press.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1956 – Award Ceremony Speech |first=Arne |last=Ölander |authorlink=Arne Ölander |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a [[nuclear chain reaction]] was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist [[Leo Szilard]] on 12 September 1933.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=13, 28}} Szilard realized that if a nuclear reaction produced [[neutron]]s or [[dineutron]]s, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating. Szilard proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts, although he did entertain the possibility of using uranium as a fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/05/16/szilards-chain-reaction/ |title=Szilard's chain reaction: visionary or crank? |publisher=Restricted Data |first=Alex |last=Wellerstein |date=16 May 2014 |accessdate=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leo |last=Szilard |authorlink=Leo Szilard |title=Improvements in or relating to the transmutation of chemical elements, British patent number: GB630726 (filed: 28 June 1934; published: 30 March 1936) |url=http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB630726 |accessdate=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of [[nuclear fission]] by German chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] in 1938,{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=251–254}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hahn | first1 = O.| authorlink = Otto Hahn| last2 = Strassmann | first2 = F.| authorlink2= Fritz Strassmann| doi = 10.1007/BF01488241 | title = Über den Nachweis und das Verhalten der bei der Bestrahlung des Urans mittels Neutronen entstehenden Erdalkalimetalle (''On the detection and characteristics of the alkaline earth metals formed by irradiation of uranium with neutrons'') | journal = Die Naturwissenschaften | volume = 27 | pages = 11 | year = 1939 |bibcode = 1939NW.....27...11H }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Frisch]],{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=256–263}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lise |last=Meitner |authorlink=Lise Meitner |first2=O.

In order for a chain reaction to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit additional neutrons to keep the reaction going. At [[Columbia University]] in New York, [[Enrico Fermi]], [[John R. Dunning|John Dunning]], [[Herbert L. Anderson]], [[Eugene T. Booth]], [[G. N. Glasoe|G. Norris Glasoe]], and [[Francis G. Slack]] conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. L. |last=Anderson |authorlink=Herbert L. Anderson |first2=E.

Pegram]], to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded [[Walter Zinn]] to become his collaborator.{{sfn|Lanouette|Silard|1992|pp=182–183}} They conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of [[Pupin Hall]] at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible.{{sfn|Lanouette|Silard|1992|pp=186–187}}

Fermi and Szilard still believed that enormous quantities of uranium would be required for an [[atomic bomb]], and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction.{{sfn|Lanouette|Silard|1992|p=227}} When he was working in Rome, Fermi had discovered that collisions between neutrons and [[neutron moderator]]s can slow the neutrons down, and thereby make them more likely to be captured by uranium nuclei, causing the uranium to fission.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=347–352}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|pp=153–156}} Szilard suggested to Fermi that they use [[carbon]] in the form of [[graphite]] as a moderator. As a back-up plan, he considered [[heavy water]]. This contained [[deuterium]], which would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen, and was a better neutron moderator than carbon; but heavy water was expensive and difficult to produce, and several tons of it might be needed.{{sfn|Lanouette|Silard|1992|pp=194–195}} Fermi estimated that a fissioning uranium nucleus produced 1.73 neutrons on average. It was enough, but a careful design was called for to minimize losses.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=28}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=H. |authorlink1=Herbert Anderson |last2=Fermi|first2=E. |authorlink2=Enrico Fermi |last3=Szilárd|first3=L. |authorlink3=Leo Szilard |title=Neutron Production and Absorption in Uranium|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=56|issue=3|date= 1 August 1939|pages=284–286|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.56.284|url=http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box5/a64g01.html|bibcode = 1939PhRv...56..284A }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Today the average number of neutrons emitted per fissioning [[uranium-235]] nucleus is known to be about 2.4.)&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA&quot;/&gt;

Szilard estimated he would need about {{convert|50|ST}} of graphite and {{convert|5|ST}} of uranium.{{sfn|Lanouette|Silard|1992|pp=194–195}} In December 1940, Fermi and Szilard met with [[Herbert G. MacPherson]] and Victor C. Hamister at National Carbon to discuss the possible existence of impurities in graphite, and the procurement of graphite of a purity that had never been produced commercially.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAEtribute3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weinberg|first=Alvin|title=Herbert G.

Over the next two years, MacPherson, Hamister and Lauchlin M. Currie developed thermal purification techniques for the large scale production of low boron content graphite.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAEtribute3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;graphite&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Currie|Hamister|MacPherson|1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting product was designated AGOT graphite (&quot;[[Acheson process|Acheson Graphite]] Ordinary Temperature&quot;) by National Carbon.

==Government support==
Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], warning of a [[German nuclear weapon project]], explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, and encouraging the development of a program that could result in their creation. With the help of [[Eugene Wigner]] and [[Edward Teller]], he approached his old friend and collaborator [[Albert Einstein]] in August 1939, and convinced him to sign the letter, lending his prestige to the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Atom,ic Archive | first = | title = Einstein's Letter to Franklin D. Roosevelt| url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Begin/Einstein.shtml | accessdate = 20 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Einstein–Szilard letter]] resulted in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = The Atomic Heritage Foundation| first = | title = Pa, this requires action!| url=http://www.mphpa.org/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=173| accessdate = 26 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029020707/http://www.mphpa.org/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=173 |archivedate=29 October 2012  |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Advisory Committee on Uranium]] was formed under [[Lyman J. Briggs]], a scientist and the director of the [[National Bureau of Standards]]. Its first meeting on 21 October 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller and Wigner. The scientists persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=19–21}}

[[File:PupinHall11.16.08ByLuigiNovi3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pupin Hall]] at [[Columbia University]]]]
In April 1941, the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC), created a special project headed by [[Arthur Compton]], a Nobel-Prize-winning physics professor at the [[University of Chicago]], to report on the uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing [[radiological weapon]]s, [[nuclear propulsion]] for ships, and [[nuclear weapons]] using [[uranium-235]] or the recently discovered [[plutonium]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=36–38}} In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the [[critical mass]] of uranium-235. He also discussed the prospects for [[uranium enrichment]] with [[Harold Urey]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=46–49}}

[[Niels Bohr]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic [[mass number]]s were [[fissile]]. If so, then [[plutonium-239]] was likely to be.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=82}} In May 1941, [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Glenn Seaborg]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch [[cyclotron]] there, and found that it had 1.7 times the [[thermal neutron]] capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time only such minute quantities of plutonium-239 had been produced, in cyclotrons, and it was not possible to produce a sufficiently large quantity that way.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|pp=192–193}} Compton discussed with Wigner how plutonium might be produced in a [[nuclear reactor]], and with [[Robert Serber]] about how that plutonium might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=46–49}}

The final draft of Compton's November 1941 report made no mention of using plutonium, but after discussing the latest research with [[Ernest Lawrence]], Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=50–51}} Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=54–55}}{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=82}} It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=180–181}} He proposed a schedule to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have an atomic bomb by January 1945.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=54–55}}

In a nuclear reactor, [[Criticality (status)|criticality]] is achieved when the rate of neutron production is equal to the rate of neutron losses, including both neutron absorption and neutron leakage. When a [[uranium]]-235 atom undergoes fission, it releases an average of 2.4 neutrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-nds.iaea.org/sgnucdat/a6.htm|title=Nuclear Data for Safeguards|last=International Atomic Energy Agency|first=|authorlink=International Atomic Energy Agency|date=|website=www-nds.iaea.org|publisher=|access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the simplest case of an [[neutron reflector|unreflected]], homogeneous, spherical reactor, the critical radius was calculated to be:{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=15}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_{crit} =  \frac{\pi M}{\sqrt{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''M'' is the surface area and ''k'' is the average [[four factor formula|neutron multiplication factor]]. The neutrons in preceding reactions will be amplified by a factor ''k'', the second generation of fission events will produce ''k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', the third ''k&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' and so on. In order for a [[self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction]] to occur, ''k'' must be at least 3 or 4 percent greater than 1. In other words, ''k'' must be greater than 1 without crossing the [[Prompt criticality|prompt critical]] threshold that would result in a rapid, [[Exponential growth|exponential increase]] in the number of fission events.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=15}}{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=396–397}}

Fermi christened his apparatus a &quot;pile&quot;. Emilio Segrè later recalled that:{{quote|I thought for a while that this term was used to refer to a source of nuclear energy in analogy with [[Alessandro Volta|Volta]]'s use of the Italian term ''pila'' to denote his own great invention of a source of electrical energy. I was disillusioned by Fermi himself, who told me that he simply used the common English word ''pile'' as synonymous with ''heap''. To my surprise, Fermi never seemed to have thought of the relationship between his ''pile'' and Volta's.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=116}} }}

Another grant, this time of $40,000, was obtained from the S-1 Uranium Committee to purchase more materials, and in August 1941 Fermi began to plan the building of a sub-critical assembly to test with a smaller structure whether a larger one would work. The so-called exponential pile he proposed to build was {{convert|8|ft}} long, {{convert|8|ft}} wide and {{convert|11|ft}} high.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=86}} This was too large to fit in the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Fermi recalled that: {{quote|We went to Dean Pegram, who was then the man who could carry out magic around the University, and we explained to him that we needed a big room. He scouted around the campus and we went with him to dark corridors and under various heating pipes and so on, to visit possible sites for this experiment and eventually a big room was discovered in Schermerhorn Hall.{{sfn|Embrey|1970|p=385}} }}

The pile was built in September 1941 from {{convert|4|by|4|by|12|in|cm|adj=on}} graphite blocks and [[tinplate]] iron cans of uranium oxide. The cans were {{convert|8|by|8|by|8|in|cm|adj=on}} cubes. When filled with uranium oxide, each weighed about {{convert|60|lb}}. There were 288 cans in all, and each was surrounded by graphite blocks so the whole would form a cubic lattice structure. A [[Neutron source#Radioisotopes which decay with alpha particles packed in a low-Z elemental matrix|radium-beryllium neutron source]] was positioned near the bottom. The uranium oxide was heated to remove moisture, and packed into the cans while still hot on a shaking table. The cans were then soldered shut. For a workforce, Pegram secured the services of Columbia's [[American football|football]] team. It was the custom at the time for football players to perform odd jobs around the university. They were able to manipulate the heavy cans with ease. The final result was a disappointing ''k'' of 0.87.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=396–397}}{{sfn|Anderson|1975|pp=86–87}}

Compton felt that having teams at Columbia University, [[Princeton University]], the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where he knew he had the unstinting support of university administration.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=399–400}} Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the [[Midwest]], where war work had not yet taken them away.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=399–400}} In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=88}}

Before leaving for Chicago, Fermi's team made one last attempt to build a working pile at Columbia. Since the cans had absorbed neutrons, they were dispensed with. Instead, the uranium oxide, heated to {{convert|480|F|C}} to dry it out, was pressed into cylindrical holes {{convert|3|in|cm}} long and {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter drilled into the graphite. The entire pile was then canned by soldering sheet metal around it, and the contents heated above the boiling point of water to remove moisture. The result was a ''k'' of 0.918.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=400–401}}

In Chicago, [[Samuel K. Allison]] had found a suitable location {{convert|60|ft}} long, {{convert|30|ft}} wide and {{convert|26|ft}} high, sunk slightly below ground level, in a space under the stands at [[Stagg Field]] originally built as a [[rackets (sport)|rackets]] court.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=401}}{{sfn|Zug|2003|pp=134–135}} Stagg Field had been largely unused since the University of Chicago had given up playing American football in 1939,{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=15}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/sports/ncaafootball/at-the-university-of-chicago-football-and-higher-education-mix.html |accessdate=2 December 2015 |title=Where Football and Higher Education Mix |first=Barry |last=Bearak |date=16 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the rackets courts under West Stands were still used for playing [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[handball]]. [[Leona Woods]] and [[Anthony L. Turkevich]] played squash there in 1940. Since it was intended for strenuous exercise, the area was unheated, and very cold in the winter. The nearby North Stands had a pair of ice skating rinks on the ground floor, which although they were unrefrigerated, seldom melted in winter.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=86}} Allison used the rackets court area to construct a {{convert|7|ft|adj=on}} experimental pile before Fermi's group arrived in 1942.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=401}}

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] assumed control of the nuclear weapons program in June 1942, and Compton's [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] became part of what came to be called the [[Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=74–75}} [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]] became director of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=427–428}} He visited the Metallurgical Laboratory for the first time on 5 October.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=431}} Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental piles under the Stagg Field stands.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=91}}

Fermi designed a new pile, which would be spherical to maximize ''k'', which was predicted to be around 1.04, thereby achieving criticality.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=429}} Leona Woods was detailed to build [[boron trifluoride]] [[neutron detector]]s as soon as she completed her doctoral thesis. She also helped Anderson locate the large number of {{convert|4|by|6|in|cm|adj=on}} timbers required at lumber yards in [[Chicago's south side]].{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=85}} Shipments of high-purity graphite arrived, mainly from National Carbon, and high-purity [[uranium dioxide]] from [[Mallinckrodt]] in St Louis, which was now producing {{convert|30|ST}} a month.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=430}} Metallic uranium also began arriving in larger quantities, the product of newly developed techniques.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=65–66, 83–88}}

On 25 June, the Army and the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD) had selected a site in the [[Red Gate Woods|Argonne Forest]] near Chicago for a plutonium pilot plant. This became known as Site A. {{convert|1025|acres}} were leased from [[Cook County]] in August,{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=67–68}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Site A&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fpdcc.com/site-a/ |title=Red Gate Woods: 'Site A' |publisher=Forest Preserves of Cook County |accessdate=26 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but by September it was apparent that the proposed facilities would be too extensive for the site, and it was decided to build the pilot plant elsewhere.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=71–72, 111–114}} The subcritical piles posed little danger, but Groves felt that it would be prudent to locate a critical pile—a fully functional nuclear reactor—at a more remote site. A building at Argonne to house Fermi's experimental pile was commenced, with its completion scheduled for 20 October. Due to industrial disputes, construction fell behind schedule, and it became clear the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed. In early November, Fermi came to Compton with a proposal to build the experimental pile under the stands at Stagg Field.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136–137}}

[[File:HD.5A.027 (10542723446).jpg|thumb|left|upright|CP-1 under construction: 4th layer]]
The risk of building an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area was a significant issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic [[nuclear meltdown]] blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even in the event of a [[Criticality accident|runaway reaction]]. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136–137}} The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind [[fission product]]s that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total [[neutron flux]].{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136–137}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107–109}}{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=17}}

Fermi argued that by using the [[delayed neutron]]s, and by carefully controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the [[prompt neutron]]s from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or [[neutron poison]], is injected at any time during this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with [[electromechanical]] [[control system]]s such as [[control rod]]s. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety,{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136–137}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107–109}} and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=137–138}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107–109}}

Compton later explained that:{{quote|As a responsible officer of the University of Chicago, according to every rule of organizational protocol, I should have taken the matter to my superior. But this would have been unfair. [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|President Hutchins]] was in no position to make an independent judgment of the hazards involved. Based on considerations of the University's welfare, the only answer he could have given would have been—no. And this answer would have been wrong.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=137–138}} }}
Compton informed Groves of his decision at the 14 November meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107–109}} Although Groves &quot;had serious misgivings about the wisdom of Compton's suggestion&quot;, he did not interfere.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=53}} [[James B. Conant]], the chairman of the NDRC, was reported to have turned white. But because of the urgency and their confidence in Fermi's calculations, no one objected.{{sfn|Nichols|1987|pp=66}}

==Construction==
[[File:HD.5A.026 (10692858884).jpg|thumb|right|upright|CP-1 under construction: 7th layer]]

Chicago Pile 1 was encased within a balloon so that the air inside could be replaced by [[carbon dioxide]]. Anderson had a dark gray balloon manufactured by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]]. A {{convert|25|ft|adj=on}} cube-shaped balloon was somewhat unusual, but the Manhattan Project's AAA priority rating ensured prompt delivery with no questions asked.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=91}}{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|p=197}} A [[block and tackle]] was used to haul it into place, with the top secured to the ceiling and three sides to the walls. The remaining side, the one facing the balcony from which Fermi directed the operation, was furled like an awning. A circle was drawn on the floor, and the stacking of graphite blocks began on the morning of 16 November 1942.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} The first layer placed was made up entirely of graphite blocks, with no uranium. Layers without uranium were alternated with two layers containing uranium, so the uranium was enclosed in graphite.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} Unlike later reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system, as it was only intended to be operated at very low power.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=436}}

The work was carried out in twelve-hour shifts, with a day shift under Zinn and a night shift under Anderson.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|pp=91–92}} For a work force they hired thirty high school dropouts that were eager to earn a bit of money before being drafted into the Army.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=16}} They machined 45,000 graphite blocks enclosing 19,000 pieces of uranium metal and uranium oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uchicago.edu/features/how_the_first_chain_reaction_changed_science/|title=How the first chain reaction changed science|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphite arrived from the manufacturers in {{convert|4.25|by|4.25|in|cm|adj=on}} bars of various lengths. They were cut into standard lengths of {{convert|16.5|in|cm}}, each weighing {{convert|19|lb}}. A lathe was used to drill {{convert|3.25|in|cm|adj=on}} holes in the blocks for the control rods and the uranium. A hydraulic press was used to shape the uranium oxide into &quot;pseudospheres&quot;, cylinders with rounded ends. Drill bits had to be sharpened after each 60 holes, which worked out to be about once an hour.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} Graphite dust soon filled the air and made the floor slippery.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=137–138}}

Another group, under Volney C. Wilson, was responsible for instrumentation.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|pp=91–92}} They also fabricated the [[control rods]], which were [[cadmium]] sheets nailed to flat wooden strips, cadmium being a potent neutron absorber, and the [[scram]] line, a [[Manila rope]] that when cut would drop a control rod into the pile and stop the reaction.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=16}} Richard Fox, who made the control-rod mechanism for the pile, remarked that the manual speed control that the operator had over the rods was simply a [[variable resistor]], controlling an [[electric motor]] that would [[wikt:spool|spool]] the [[clothesline]] wire over a pulley that also had two lead weights attached to ensure it would [[fail-safe]] and return to its zero position when released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter1.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825162412/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter1.shtml |journal=ORNL Review |issn=0048-1262 |title=Chapter 1: Wartime Laboratory |volume=25 |issue=3 and 4 |year=2002 |accessdate=22 March 2016 |archivedate=25 August 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HD.5A.028 (10542725116).jpg|thumb|left|upright|CP-1 under construction: 10th layer]]
About two layers were laid per shift.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} Woods' boron trifluoride neutron counter was inserted at the 15th layer. Thereafter, readings were taken at the end of each shift.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=119}} Fermi divided the square of the radius of the pile by the intensity of the radioactivity to obtain a metric that counted down to one as the pile approached criticality. At the 15th layer, it was 390; at the 19th it was 320; at the 25th it was 270 and by the 36th it was only 149. The original design was for a spherical pile, but as work proceeded, it became clear that this would not be necessary. The new graphite was purer, and {{convert|6|ST}} of very pure metallic uranium began to arrive from the [[Ames Project]] at [[Iowa State University]],{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=434}} where a team under [[Frank Spedding]] had developed [[Ames process|a new process]] to produce uranium metal. [[Westinghouse Lamp Plant]] supplied {{convert|3|ST}}, which it produced in a rush with a makeshift process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The {{convert|2.25|in|cm|adj=on}} metallic uranium cylinders, known as &quot;Spedding's eggs&quot;, were dropped in the holes in the graphite in lieu of the uranium oxide pseudospheres. The process of filling the balloon with carbon dioxide would not be necessary, and twenty layers could be dispensed with. According to Fermi's new calculations, the countdown would reach 1 between the 56th and 57th layers. The resulting pile was therefore flatter on the top than on the bottom.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} Anderson called a halt after the 57th layer was placed.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=93}} When completed, the wooden frame supported an elliptical-shaped structure, {{convert|20|ft}} high, {{convert|6|ft}} wide at the ends and {{convert|25|ft}} across the middle.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fermi|first=Enrico|date=1952|title=Experimental Production of a Divergent Chain Reaction|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/20/9/10.1119/1.1933322|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=20|issue=9|pages=536–558|doi=10.1119/1.1933322|issn=0002-9505|pmid=|access-date=|via=|bibcode=1952AmJPh..20..536F}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained {{convert|6|ST}} of uranium metal, {{convert|50|ST}} of uranium oxide and {{convert|400|ST}} of graphite, at an estimated cost of $2.7 million.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=16–17}}

The startup began at 09:54. Walter Zinn removed the zip, the emergency control rod, and secured it. Norman Hilberry stood ready with an axe to cut the scram line, which would allow the zip to fall under the influence of gravity. While Leona Woods called out the count from the boron trifluoride detector in a loud voice, [[George Weil]], the only one on the floor, withdrew all but one of the control rods.

He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip.

On 12 December 1942 CP-1's power output was increased to 200 W, enough to power a light bulb. Lacking shielding of any kind, it was a radiation hazard for everyone in the vicinity, and further testing was continued at 0.5 W.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|p=3.9}} Operation was terminated on 28 February 1943,{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=23}} and the pile was dismantled and moved to Site A in the Argonne Forest, now known as Red Gate Woods.&lt;ref name=&quot;cp1anl&quot;&gt;

Instead of being spherical, the new reactor was built in a cube-like shape, about {{convert|25|ft}} tall with a base approximately {{convert|30|ft}} square. It was surrounded by concrete walls {{convert|5|ft}} thick that acted as a [[radiation shield]]ing, with overhead protection from {{convert|6|in|cm}} of lead and {{convert|50|in|cm}} of wood. More uranium was used, so it contained {{convert|52|ST}} of uranium and {{convert|472|ST}} of graphite. No cooling system was provided as it only ran at a few kilowatts. CP-2 became operational in March 1943, with a ''k'' of 1.055.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|p=3.13}}{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=428}}&lt;ref name=&quot;fermi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fermi | first=Enrico | title=The Development of the first chain reaction pile | journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] | year=1946 | volume=90 | pp=20–24| jstor=3301034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war Zinn allowed CP-2 to be run around the clock, and its design was suitable for conducting experiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;waste&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2009/03/05/the-way-things-work-nuclear-waste/ |title=The Way Things Work: Nuclear waste |newspaper=The Chicago Maroon |date=5 March 2009 |first=Claire |last=McNear  |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CP-2 was joined by [[Chicago Pile-3]], the first heavy water reactor, which went critical on 15 May 1944.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=428}}&lt;ref name=&quot;fermi&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Marker at Site A.jpg|thumb|left | alt=Image of the granite marker. The text reads: &quot;The world's first nuclear reactor was rebuilt at this site in 1943 after initial operation at the University of Chicago. This reactor (CP-2) and the first heavy water moderated reactor (CP-3) where major facilities around which developed the Argonne National Laboratory. This site was released by the laboratory in 1956 and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission then buried the reactors here.&quot;|Commemorative boulder at Site A]]
The reactors were used to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of [[tritium]]. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 over the course of a year.{{sfn|Wattenberg|1975|p=123}} An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his [[white blood cell]] count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site A&quot;/&gt;

The Red Gate Woods later became the original site of [[Argonne National Laboratory]], which replaced the Metallurgical Laboratory on 1 July 1946, with Zinn as its first director.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=47}} CP-2 and CP-3 operated for ten years before they outlived their usefulness, and Zinn ordered them shut down on 15 May 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site A&quot;/&gt; Their remaining usable fuel was transferred to [[Chicago Pile-5]] at the Argonne National Laboratory's new site in [[DuPage County]], and the CP-2 and CP-3 reactors were dismantled in 1955 and 1956. High-level nuclear waste such as fuel and heavy water were shipped to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], for disposal. The rest was encased in concrete and buried in a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} trench in what is now known as the [[Site A/Plot M Disposal Site]]. It is marked by a commemorative boulder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site A&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Szilard and Hilberry.jpg|upright|thumb|Leo Szilard (right) and Norman Hilberry under the plaque commemorating Chicago Pile-1 on the West Stands of Old Stagg Field. While the stands were later demolished, the plaque is now located at [[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)|the site memorial.]]]]
By the 1970s there was increased public concern about the levels of radioactivity at the site, which was used by the local residents for recreational purposes. Surveys conducted in the 1980s found [[strontium-90]] in the soil at Plot M, trace amounts of tritium in nearby wells, and plutonium, technetium, cesium, and uranium in the area. In 1994, the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the Argonne National Laboratory yielded to public pressure and earmarked $24.7 million and $3.4 million respectively to rehabilitate the site. As part of the clean up, {{convert|500|cuyd}} of radioactive waste was removed and sent to the [[Hanford Site]] for disposal. By 2002, the [[Illinois Department of Public Health]] had determined that the remaining materials posed no danger to public health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site A&quot;/&gt;

==Significance and commemoration==
A commemorative plaque was unveiled at Stagg Field on 2 December 1952, the occasion of the tenth anniversary of CP-1 going critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=26 July 1957 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1957/07/26/page/17/article/u-of-c-to-raze-stagg-fields-atomic-cradle |title=U. of C. to Raze Stagg Field's Atomic Cradle |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It read: {{quote|On December 2, 1942 man achieved here the first self-sustaining chain reaction and thereby initiated the controlled release of nuclear energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;plaques&quot;/&gt; }} The plaque was saved when the West Stands were demolished in August 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=16 August 1957 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1957/08/16/page/30/article/remove-nuclear-site-plaque |title=Remove Nuclear Site Plaque |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of CP-1 was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 18 February 1965.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; When the [[National Register of Historic Places]] was created in 1966, it was immediately added to that as well.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; The site was also named a [[Chicago Landmark]] on 27 October 1971.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{cite web |title=Site of the First Self-Sustaining Controlled Nuclear Chain Reaction |url=http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/landmarksweb/web/landmarkdetails.htm?lanId=1383 |publisher=[[City of Chicago]] |accessdate=26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the site of the old Stagg Field is occupied by the University's [[Regenstein Library]], which was opened in 1970, and the [[Joe and Rika Mansueto Library]], which was opened in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://125.uchicago.edu/then-and-now/stagg-field-mansueto-library/ |title=Stagg Field / Mansueto Library |publisher=University of Chicago |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Henry Moore]] sculpture, ''[[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)|Nuclear Energy]]'', stands in a small quadrangle just outside the Regenstein Library.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; It was dedicated on 2 December 1967, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of CP-1 going critical. The commemorative plaques from 1952, 1965 and 1967 are nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;plaques&quot;&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzGFkc3wm1g |title=Site of the Fermi's &quot;Atomic Pile&quot; – First Nuclear Reactor |publisher=YouTube  |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A graphite block from CP-1 can be seen at the [[Bradbury Science Museum]] in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]]; another is on display at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/articles/first-hand-recollections-first-self-sustaining-chain-reaction |title=First-Hand Recollections of the First Self-Sustaining Chain Reaction |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] |accessdate=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
