In one of his interviews with the newspaper &quot;Evening Almaty&quot;, he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My family - simple rural workers formed my views, outlook, based on love and desire to work. All that stays with me through all my life. My parents taught me – You must work hard. Nothing in this life is given for granted. To achieve something you need to put all of yourself, you must put all your soul into it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
