{{Women in warfare}}
{{Women in society sidebar}}
The role of '''women in ancient warfare''' differed from culture to culture. Warfare throughout written history mainly has been portrayed in modern times as a matter for men, but women also have played a role. Until very recently, little mention of these exploits was included in retellings of history in most countries, aside from the [[Amazons]].

Female deities, whose origins predate historical records, are present in most early cultures. Often they were portrayed as [[warrior]]s, which signals a pervasive presence of women among such activities prior to a profound change in many human cultures after the adoption of agriculture as the typical sustenance (and which enabled protracted warfare with large armies).

Their influences, the roles of women rulers, and those of significant women, were retained in many of these cultures so strongly that no layers of new legends, ideals, and myths were able to obscure them completely.

The following is a list of prominent women who participated in warfare, which was assembled from the fragmentary beginning of written records to approximately 500 AD. [[archaeology|Archaeological research]] provides more details and clues regularly.
