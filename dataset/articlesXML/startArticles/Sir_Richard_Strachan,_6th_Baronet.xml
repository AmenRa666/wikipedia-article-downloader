'''Sir Richard John Strachan, 6th Baronet''' [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] (27 October 1760 – 3 February 1828) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] officer of the [[Royal Navy]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], eventually rising to the rank of [[admiral]].  Sir Dicky, as his friends referred to him, was the last Chief of Clan Strachan.  The Baronetcy became dormant in 1854 as he died without male heir.

==Childhood==
Strachan was born in [[Devon]] on 27 October 1760, the eldest son of Lieutenant Patrick Strachan RN and a daughter of Captain Pitman RN.  His uncle was [[Sir John Strachan, 5th Baronet|Sir John Strachan]], fifth [[baronet]].  Strachan entered the Royal Navy in 1772 at the age of twelve, serving first aboard [[HMS Intrepid (1770)|HMS ''Intrepid'']].  He sailed with ''Intrepid'' to the [[East Indies]], before moving to [[HMS Orford (1749)|HMS ''Orford'']], then under the command of his uncle.  He went on to serve in a number of different ships on the [[North America and West Indies Station|North American Station]], first aboard [[HMS Preston (1757)|HMS ''Preston'']] under [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], followed by [[HMS Eagle (1774)|HMS ''Eagle'']], the [[flagship]] of [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]].

==Early career==
Strachan went on to serve aboard [[HMS Actaeon (1778)|HMS ''Actaeon'']] off the coast of [[Africa]], and in the [[West Indies]].  On the death of his uncle on 26 December 1777, he succeeded to the baronetcy.  He was promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 5 April 1779 and was then appointed to [[HMS Hero (1759)|HMS ''Hero'']] in early 1781, under the command of Captain James Hawker.  Aboard ''Hero'' Strachan was part of Commodore [[George Johnstone (Royal Navy officer)|George Johnstone's]] squadron, and was present at the [[Battle of Porto Praya]] against the [[Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez|Bailli de Suffren]] on 16 April 1781.  After this action, ''Hero'' moved on to the [[East Indies]], where Strachan moved to take up a post, first aboard [[HMS Magnanime (1780)|HMS ''Magnanime'']] and then aboard [[HMS Superb (1760)|HMS ''Superb'']].  It was whilst aboard ''Superb'' that Strachan was present at the first of four actions that took place between [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] and de Suffren, the [[Battle of Sadras]] on 17 February 1782.

==First commands==
After acquitting himself well, Strachan was promoted by Hughes in January 1783 to the command of the [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] [[HMS Lizard (1782)|HMS ''Lizard'']], and then again on 26 April 1783 to be captain of the [[frigate]] [[HMS Naiad (1783)|''Naiad'']].  Strachan's next appointment was in 1787 to [[HMS Vestal (1779)|HMS ''Vestal'']].  He sailed in the spring of 1788 for [[China]], carrying the [[ambassador]], the Hon. Charles Alan Cathcart.  Cathcart died during the journey, as ''Vestal'' passed through the Strait of Banca, and the ship returned to England.  Strachan and ''Vestal'' were then ordered to the East Indies again, to join a squadron under the command of Commodore [[William Cornwallis]].  On arrival, Strachan was reassigned to [[HMS Phoenix (1783)|HMS ''Phoenix'']].  In November 1791 she was ordered to stop and search the [[French frigate Résolue (1778)|French frigate ''Résolue'']], which was escorting a number of merchant ships believed to be carrying military supplies to support [[Tippu Sultan]]. ''Résolue'' resisted ''Phoenix'' and a [[Battle of Tellicherry|brief fight ensued]] before ''Résolue'' struck her colours.  The French captain insisted on considering his ship as a British prize, so Cornwallis ordered Strachan to tow her into [[Mahé, India|Mahé]] and return her to the French commodore.

==Off the French coast==
Strachan returned to England in 1793, and was appointed to command the frigate [[HMS Concorde (1783)|HMS ''Concorde'']] and in spring 1794 joined a squadron patrolling off [[Brest, France|Brest]], under the command of Sir [[John Borlase Warren]].  The squadron [[Action of 23 April 1794|engaged a rival squadron of four French frigates on 23 April 1794]] and succeeded in capturing three of them.  Strachan and ''Concorde'' had forced the surrender of one of them, the frigate ''L'Engageante''.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13646|startpage=379|date=28 April 1794|accessdate=2008-02-19}}  Strachan's dispatch describing the capture of ''L'Engageante''&lt;/ref&gt; Strachan was then appointed to the 42-gun [[HMS Melampus (1785)|HMS ''Melampus'']] which was attached in the summer to the main British fleet.  In spring 1795 Strachan was dispatched in command of a squadron of five frigates to cruise off the [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] coasts.  He was highly successful at this, capturing or destroying a considerable number of French coastal craft, many laden with military stores and conveyed by armed French warships.  On 9 May 1795, he captured ''Crache-feu'', a French three-gun vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13778|startpage=453|date=12 May 1795|accessdate=2008-02-19}}  Strachan's dispatch describing the capture of the ''Crache-feu''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Command of the ''Diamond'' and the ''Captain''===
In 1796 Strachan was appointed to command [[HMS Diamond (1794)|HMS ''Diamond'']], after her previous captain, [[William Sidney Smith|Sir Sidney Smith]] had been captured during a cutting-out expedition. On 31 December 1796, Strachan captured the French 12-gun brig [[French brig Amarante (1793)|''Amaranthe'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=31 December 1796|issue=13967|startpage=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the Royal Navy took into service as HMS ''Amaranthe''.

Strachan commanded ''Diamond'' until 1799, when he took command of the 74-gun [[third rate]] [[HMS Captain (1787)|HMS ''Captain'']].  He took her off the west coast of France, at times operating as part of a squadron, and at other times alone.  On 5 November 1800 he came to the assistance of the stranded and sinking [[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS ''Marlborough'']], which had struck a ledge of rocks near Isle Grouat during the previous night's gale. ''Captain''’s  boats were pushed through the surf and were able to take off ''Marlborough''’s officers and crew.

Later that month, on 17 November ''Captain'' chased a French convoy through the Teignouse Passage between [[Quiberon]] and the [[Houat|Ile de Houat]], and tried to keep them from reaching safety in the [[Gulf of Morbihan]].  Despite his efforts, the convoy reached the cover of a 20-gun [[corvette]], and a number of coastal forts the next day.  The situation changed when the [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] [[HMS Nile (1806)|HMS ''Nile'']] attacked the corvette and forced her aground in Port Navalo.  The corvette struck her colours, at which point boats from [[French frigate Magicienne (1778)|HMS ''Magicienne'']] attempted to board and capture her.  They were driven off by fire from the corvette and returned to ''Magicienne''.  Strachan meanwhile devised a plan to attack the French.

Later that day, ''Magicienne'' was ordered to approach, to draw the fire of the batteries. Strachan ordered Lieutenant Hannah and a party of seamen and marines into four boats, which were towed into the harbour by ''Suwarrow''; while ''Nile'' and [[HMS Pigmy (1781)|HMS ''Lurcher'']] towed another four more boats manned by ''Marlborough''’s men who had been rescued by Strachan three weeks previously.  Under heavy fire of [[Grapeshot|grape]], round and musket-balls from the shore battery high above, they boarded the corvette, and set her on fire. They then re-embarked and began heading back towards ''Captain'', when the corvette blew up with a tremendous explosion.  The British lost only one man killed, when a shot hit the fluke of ''Suwarrow''’s anchor, ricocheted, and struck the head of a sailor. Seven others were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15315|startpage=1349|date=29 November 1800|accessdate=2008-02-19}}  Strachan's dispatch describing the action near the Teignouse Passage&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1801, Strachan almost died when ''Captain'' struck a rock off [[Ushant]] with such force that she started taking on water at almost 3&amp;nbsp;inches a minute, which constantly increased. The damage was so severe that the incoming water nearly overloaded the pumps. She eventually made it into the Sound on 11 January attended by [[HMS Fisgard (1797)|HMS ''Fisgard'']] and the cutter from [[HMS Lord Nelson (1800)|HMS ''Lord Nelson'']]. ''Captain'' fired distress guns until she reached the narrows, when all the boats from the dock and the fleet came out to assist her. ''Captain'' eventually made it to the [[Hamoaze]], and went back into [[Cawsand|Cawsand Bay]] on 5 May.

===Command of the ''Donegal''===
{{further|Action of 25 November 1804}}
In 1802 Strachan was appointed to command [[HMS Donegal (1798)|HMS ''Donegal'']]. Whilst serving aboard her, he was made senior officer at [[Gibraltar]] and ordered to watch the combined [[French Navy|French]] and [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] fleet at [[Cadiz]], under the orders of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]].  Whilst on this station, she spotted and gave chase to the large 42-gun Spanish frigate ''Amfitrite'' in November 1804. After pursuing her for 46 hours, ''Amfitrite'' lost her [[mizzen mast|mizzen-top-mast]] and was subsequently overhauled by ''Donegal''.

A boat was dispatched from ''Donegal'' and the Spanish captain was brought aboard.  Sir Richard did not speak Spanish and the captain did not speak English, so it was with difficulty that Sir Richard attempted to inform him that his orders were to return the ''Amfitrite'' back to Cadiz.  Sir Richard allowed the captain three minutes to decide whether he would comply with the order, but after waiting for six minutes without an answer, opened fire on ''Amfitrite''. The engagement lasted only eight minutes, and resulted in a number of deaths, including the Spanish captain, who fell to a [[musket]] ball. ''Amfitrite'' surrendered and after being searched, was found to be laden with stores and carrying dispatches from Cadiz to [[Tenerife]] and [[Havana]]. She was taken over and later commissioned into the Navy as [[HMS Amfitrite (1804)|HMS ''Amfitrite'']]. ''Donegal'' would later make another capture off Cadiz, taking a Spanish vessel carrying a cargo reputed to be worth £200,000.

==After Trafalgar==
[[Image:Ortegal.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Battle of Cape Ortegal]].  Strachan completes the destruction of the French fleet]]
On 23 April 1804 Strachan was made a [[colonel]] of [[Royal Marines|marines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15695|startpage=496|date=21 April 1804|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to England in [[HMS Renown (1798)|HMS ''Renown'']].  On arrival he was immediately appointed to [[HMS Caesar (1793)|HMS ''Caesar'']] and placed in command of a detached squadron including three [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] and four frigates in the [[Bay of Biscay]].  Whilst sailing off [[Cape Finisterre]] on 2 November 1805, the squadron encountered four French ships of the line that had escaped from the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] under the command of [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley|Rear-Admiral Dumanoir le Pelley]].  Sir Richard pursued them, bringing them to battle on 4 November.  After a short engagement, known as the [[Battle of Cape Ortegal]] he captured all of them, completing the destruction of the French fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Strachan's original dispatches describing the battle of Cape Ortegal:&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15860|startpage=1389|endpage=1392|date=11 November 1805|accessdate=2008-02-19}} (third and fourth pages missing)&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15861|startpage=1399|endpage=1400|date=9 November 1805|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strachan was promoted to the rank of [[Rear-Admiral of the Blue]] on 9 November 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15859|startpage=1373|endpage=1375|date=5 November 1805|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When, on 28 January 1806, the thanks of both [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] were voted to those who had fought at Trafalgar, Strachan and his command was specially included.  He was also (by special [[Act of Parliament]]) rewarded with a [[pension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15894|startpage=264|date=25 February 1806|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of £1,000 a year.  On 29 January he was created a [[Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (KB),&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15885|startpage=128|date=28 January 1806|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[City of London Corporation|City of London]] voted him the freedom of the city, and awarded him a sword of honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmmc.co.uk/images/uploaded/downloads/Trafalgar_Strachan.pdf Account of the battle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clan Strachan.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.clanstrachan.com/heritage/admiral_sir_strachan.htm Clan Strachan.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Strachan was soon back in service, being dispatched early in 1806 to search for a French squadron reported to have sailed for America.  After searching for some time, he failed to locate it and instead returned to watch the port of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. Thick fog and poor weather covered the port in January 1808, and allowed the French to sail out undetected and escape to the [[Mediterranean]]. Strachan gave chase, joining [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Admiral Collingwood's]] forces, but the French were able to gain the safety of [[Toulon]].  Strachan was ordered to return home, where he was given command of a squadron watching the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] coast.

On 9 June 1809, he was appointed as the naval commander of an expedition, consisting of 264 warships and 352 transports carrying 44,000 troops, to attack the island of [[Walcheren]] and destroy the French arsenals in the [[Scheldt]].  Strachan was ill qualified for the position, lacking both the experience and the temperament to hold a joint command in such a complex combined operation.  Whilst he was careful to attend to the details of the problems that the Navy might encounter, he failed to consider the army's problems.  Relations with the army's commander, Lord Chatham, quickly became strained and the ambitious [[Walcheren Campaign]] ended up being abandoned, having only achieved the capture of [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]].&lt;ref&gt;Strachan's original dispatches describing the Walcheren expedition:&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16282|startpage=1232|endpage=1233|date=7 August 1809|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16287|startpage=1297|endpage=1299|date=15 August 1809|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16289|startpage=1325|endpage=1328|date=20 August 1809|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16325|startpage=2006|endpage=2007|date=16 December 1809|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16328|startpage=2056|endpage=2057|date=26 December 1809|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A period of angry recriminations followed the withdrawal, with Chatham presenting a narrative to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in 1810, blaming Strachan for the expedition's failure. Strachan defended himself, declaring that the ships had done all that had been required of them. He nevertheless became the [[scapegoat]] for the failure, and was not given any more assignments.

The confusion and conflicting accounts led to the following doggerel verse:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Great Chatham, with his sabre drawn,&lt;br&gt;
Stood waiting for Sir Richard Strachan;&lt;br&gt;
Sir Richard, longing to be at 'em,&lt;br&gt;
Stood waiting for the Earl of Chatham.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clan Strachan.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later life and death==
Despite these controversies, promotion being entirely on the basis of seniority, he was made a Rear-Admiral of the Red on 25 October 1809,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16309|startpage=1685|endpage=1686|date=24 October 1809|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Vice-Admiral of the Blue on 31 July 1810,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16391|startpage=1117|endpage=1118|date=28 July 1810|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice-Admiral of the White on 12 August 1812,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16632|startpage=1584|date=11 August 1812|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice-Admiral of the Red on 4 June 1814,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16906|startpage=1187|date=7 June 1814|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Admiral of the White on 19 July 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=17727|startpage=1511|date=20 July 1821|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], and his temporary incarceration aboard [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']] in 1815, Strachan set out to see the man he had spent most of his career fighting to defeat.  Napoleon himself was apparently aware of Strachan's deeds.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On Thursday he (Napoleon Bonaparte) gratified the spectators with his appearance frequently on the poop and gangway, on which occasions the British, as well as the French officers, stood uncovered and apart! One of his officers intimating to him, that Sir Richard Strachan was in a barge alongside, Bonaparte instantly took off his hat, and bowed to him with a smile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clan Strachan.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Order of the Bath]] was reorganised on 2 January 1815, with surviving Knights Companion becoming the first Knights Grand Cross (GCB).&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16972|startpage=17|date=4 January 1815|accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir Richard Strachan died at his house in [[Bryanston Square]], London, on 3 February 1828.  He had married [[Louisa Dillon, Marchioness of Salsa]] in 1812, and together they had three daughters, but no son.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00114553&amp;tree=LEO&lt;/ref&gt; The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.

==Assessment==
Strachan became famous during his career for his ungovernable temper and violent cursing.  This eventually earned him the nickname of ‘Mad Dick’ among his men, but he remained a popular and sought-after commander. Captain [[Graham Moore (admiral)|Graham Moore]], the brother of [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]], described him on the eve of the Walcheren expedition as &lt;blockquote&gt;one of those in our service whom I estimate the highest. I do not believe he has his fellow among the Admirals, unless it be [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Pellew]], for ability, and it is not possible to have more zeal and gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maxwell1.95&quot;&gt;(Maxwell, Vol 1, No. 95)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Despite the failure of the venture, he was later to declare that&lt;blockquote&gt;It is my wish to serve with Strachan, as I know him to be extremely brave and full of zeal and ardour, at the same time that he is an excellent seaman, and, tho' an irregular, impetuous fellow, possessing very quick parts and an uncommon share of sagacity and strong sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maxwell1.95&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}} Some confusion over which baronet he was exists.  The [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] lists him as the 4th, but both [[Debrett's]] and [[Burke's Peerage]] list him as the 6th.
