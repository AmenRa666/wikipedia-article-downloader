==Biography==
Campbell was born in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;named&quot;&gt;Inklebarger, Timothy. &quot;Murkowski names Campbell military chief&quot;, ''Juneau Empire''. December 30, 2002. State and Regional section.&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts]] and attended the [[University of Tulsa]] in [[Oklahoma]] on a Reserve Officer's Training Corp. ([[ROTC]]) scholarship, and graduated in 1974 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]]. He was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] that year and was assigned to the Air Traffic Control Officers Training Course at [[Keesler Air Force Base]] in [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;statebio&quot;/&gt;

After being certified as an [[air traffic controller]], he was assigned to [[Travis Air Force Base]] in [[California]], then to [[K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base]] in [[Michigan]]. Each assignment brought a promotion, and he left Sawyer in 1979 as a [[Captain (United States)|captain]]. From Sawyer, he moved to [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], where he served as chief of air traffic control operations until 1981. During his stay at Vandenberg, he attended classes and earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] degree from [[Golden Gate University]] in nearby [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;statebio&quot;/&gt;

In 1981, he was assigned to Alaska for the first time when he was named the chief of air traffic control operations with the 1930th Communications Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base in [[Anchorage]]. He left active-duty U.S. Air Force, joined the [[California Air National Guard]], and was assigned duties at [[Hayward Air National Guard Base]] in that state in 1984.

In addition, he worked extensively in the private sector, with over 15 years of aviation consulting experience including airport master planning, environmental planning, economic feasibility studies, and facilities location planning—both in the U.S. and internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;akaerospace.com&quot;&gt;http://www.akaerospace.com/craig_campbell_bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell has been active in Alaskan politics since being first elected to the [[City council|Assembly]] 1986, when he was first elected to the Anchorage Assembly, representing the [[Chugiak]], [[Eagle River (Anchorage)|Eagle River]], Birchwood, Peters Creek, Eklutna, and Mountain View sections of Anchorage.  The district also included Elmendorf and the other major military base in Anchorage, Fort Richardson (the two have since been combined as [[Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;named&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Megan. [http://www.adn.com/politics/story/852915.html &quot;Craig Campbell to replace Parnell&quot;], ''Anchorage Daily News''. July 3, 2009. Retrieved July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently was re-elected in 1989 and 1992, serving twice as Chairman of the Assembly.

In 1991, he joined the Alaska National Guard and became commander of the 168th Resource Management Squadron at [[Eielson Air Force Base]] in Alaska. He later was made commander of the 168th Logistics Squadron at the base and was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;statebio&quot;/&gt;

In 1994, Campbell unsuccessfully ran for Mayor of Anchorage, coming in third out of a field of fourteen candidates in the non-partisan, municipality-wide election.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=489438&lt;/ref&gt; He later served on the Matanuska Electric Association Board of Directors from 1996 - 2000,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apfboardconfirmation.org/campbell.html&lt;/ref&gt; and as an adjunct professor for Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University from 1990 - 2000.

In 1997, he moved into a staff position with the Alaska Air National Guard in Anchorage. In 1999, he earned a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[national security]] and [[strategic studies]] from the [[Naval War College]] at Newport, Rhode Island. He stayed in staff positions until 2000, when he was promoted to [[colonel]] and named vice commander of the [[168th Air Refueling Wing]] at Eielson. While there, he helped command the wing's operations in support of the American war effort in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Ipsen, Beth. &quot;Latitude adjustment - 168th Air Refueling Wing has dual duty in Alaska, Guam&quot;, ''Fairbanks Daily News-Miner''. March 17, 2002. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year that he was named vice-commander, he became executive director of Anchorage's Office of Planning, Development and Public Works.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press. &quot;Ex-Assemblyman to lead Army, Air Guard&quot;, ''Anchorage Daily News''. December 31, 2002. Page B1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he was selected by then-Alaska governor [[Frank Murkowski]] to serve as the state's adjutant general—the commander of the Alaska National Guard—and commissioner of the [[Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;named&quot;/&gt; Following Palin's election in 2006, he was reconfirmed in his office.&lt;ref name=&quot;statebio&quot;/&gt;

Campbell has 35 years of aerospace experience in the USAF and Alaska National Guard, during which he oversaw the Alaska Army National Guard development of missile defense operations and security missions at Ft. Greely, AK; the relocation of Kulis Air National Guard Base to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson; the formation of an associate flying unit between the USAF and Alaska Air National Guard for operations of the C-17 Globemaster III strategic airlift transport; and establishment of a state partnership between the Alaska National Guard and the country of Mongolia.&lt;ref name=&quot;akaerospace.com&quot;/&gt;

Campbell was promoted to lieutenant (three-star) general within the state National Guard by Palin on September 7, 2008. He retained his federal National Guard rank of major (two-star) general&lt;ref&gt;State of Alaska. [http://www.gov.state.ak.us/news.php?id=1449 &quot;Alaska NG Adjutant General Promoted&quot;], gov.state.ak.us. September 8, 2008. Retrieved July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; until he retired August 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;National Guard Bureau. [http://www.ng.mil/ngbgomo/library/bio/1040.htm], www.ngb.mil. Retrieved December 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell became the president and chief executive officer for Alaska Aerospace Corporation in 2012.

==Lieutenant governor==
&lt;!--This same bogus information keeps showing up in article after article.  Here's the straight scoop - under that same Alaska state constitution (or perhaps authority specifically delegated by the constitution to statute, I can't remember exactly), the governor establishes an order of succession from amongst his or her cabinet.  Palin's designated replacement for Parnell was Joe Schmidt, the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections.  Schmidt refused the &quot;promotion&quot; when it became apparent that he would become lieutenant governor.  As someone with a career in corrections, it's entirely likely that he viewed this as a demotion and/or career suicide.  For some reason, this important fact keeps getting whitewashed or glossed over.--&gt;
Under the Alaska state constitution, a governor's selection of a new lieutenant governor is subject to confirmation by the State Legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;juneauempire.com&quot;/&gt;  The same Constitution, however, gives the governor the power to make &quot;recess appointments&quot;, and the Legislature was not in session when Parnell succeeded as governor on July 26. Following Palin's announcement, conflicting statements issued from Alaska legal authorities as to whether Parnell had the authority to appoint a lieutenant governor without approval from the state legislature.  The state attorney general stated that while Palin could name Campbell lieutenant governor, it would be preferable to have him sworn in as acting or temporary lieutenant governor, taking the permanent post only upon approval of the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/071209/loc_462410851.shtml |title=AG: Palin can appoint an 'acting' lieutenant governor |publisher=Juneau Empire |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ktuu.com/Global/story.asp?S=10708481&lt;/ref&gt;  Only July 26, after then-Lieutenant Governor Parnell was sworn in as governor, Campbell was given the oath as &quot;temporary substitute&quot; lieutenant governor.  The oath was administered by [[Alaska Supreme Court]] Justice Daniel E. Winfree.  After coming back into session, the Legislature confirmed Campbell as lieutenant governor by a vote of 55-4.&lt;ref name=&quot;state1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;juneauempire.com&quot;/&gt;
