'''HMS ''Crescent''''' was a  [[C and D-class destroyer|C-class]] [[destroyer]] which was built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the [[Home Fleet]], although she was temporarily deployed in the [[Red Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean]] during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1935–36. ''Crescent'' was sold to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in late 1936 and renamed HMCS ''Fraser''. She was stationed on the west coast of Canada until the beginning of [[World War II]] when she was transferred to the [[Atlantic]] coast for convoy escort duties. The ship was transferred to the United Kingdom (UK) in May 1940 and helped to evacuate refugees from France upon her arrival in early June. ''Fraser'' was sunk on 25 June 1940 in a collision with the [[anti-aircraft cruiser]] {{HMS|Calcutta|D82|6}} while returning from one such mission.

==Design and construction==
''Crescent'' displaced {{convert|1375|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1865|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|329|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|36000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|36|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Crescent'' carried a maximum of {{convert|473|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|5500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}. The ship's complement was 145 officers and men.&lt;ref name=w78&gt;Whitley, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship mounted four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch Mk IX guns]] in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Crescent'' had a single [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt|QF 3-inch 20 cwt]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;cwt&quot; is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 30 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.&lt;/ref&gt; AA gun between her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s, and two {{convert|40|mm|adj=on|1}} [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk II]] AA guns mounted on the aft end of her [[forecastle]] deck. The {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} AA gun was removed in 1936 and the 2-pounders were relocated to between the funnels. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|21-inch torpedoes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenton, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Three depth-charge chutes were fitted, each with a capacity of two [[depth charge]]s. After World War II began this was increased to 33 depth charges, delivered by one or two rails and two throwers.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 209, 236, 298–99&lt;/ref&gt;

''Crescent'' was ordered on 30 January 1930 as part of the 1929 Naval Programme and laid down on 1 December 1930 at [[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]]. She was launched on 29 September 1931 and completed on 15 April 1932.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
After the ship commissioned on 21 April 1932, she was assigned to the [[2nd Destroyer Flotilla]] of the Home Fleet. ''Crescent'' collided with her [[sister ship|sister]] {{HMS|Comet|H00|6}} at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] on 21 July and was under repair until 27 August. ''Crescent'' was refitted at Chatham between 30 March and 6 May 1933, before deploying to the [[West Indies]] between January and March 1934. She was given another refit at Chatham from 27 July to 3 September 1934. ''Crescent'' was detached from the Home Fleet during the Abyssinian Crisis, and deployed in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea from September 1935 to April 1936. When the ship returned, she was refitted at Sheerness between 23 April to 13 June and placed briefly in reserve.&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 45, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy===
Together with her sister {{HMS|Cygnet|H83|6}}, ''Crescent'' was sold to Canada on 20 October 1936 for a total price of £400,000. She was refitted again to meet Canadian standards, including the installation of [[ASDIC]] (sonar), and taken over by them on 1 February 1937. The ship was renamed as HMCS ''Fraser'' and commissioned into the RCN at Chatham on 17 February. ''Fraser'' was assigned to the Canadian Pacific Coast and arrived at [[CFB Esquimalt|Esquimalt]] on 3 May 1937. She remained there until she was ordered to the East Coast on 31 August 1939.&lt;ref name=e8&gt;English, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

When World War II began on 3 September, ''Fraser'' was transiting the [[Panama Canal]] and arrived at [[CFB Halifax|Halifax]] on 15 September. She and her sisters were employed as local escorts to ocean convoys sailing from Halifax. In November the Royal Navy's [[North America and West Indies Station]] took operational control of the Canadian destroyers.&lt;ref name=e8/&gt; The ship escorted the convoy bringing most of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to Britain part way across the [[North Atlantic]] in mid-December.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1940 she was ordered to join the Jamaica Force for Caribbean patrols&lt;ref name=e8/&gt; before being reassigned to Western Approaches Command two months later.&lt;ref name=w78/&gt; On 26 May she left [[Bermuda]] for Britain and arrived at [[Plymouth]] on 3 June where she was pressed into service evacuating [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops from various French ports on the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref name=e8/&gt; Sometime in 1940, the ship's aft set of torpedo tubes was removed and replaced by a {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}} AA gun.&lt;ref name=w78/&gt;
[[File:HMCS Fraser (H48).jpg|thumb|HMCS ''Fraser'' on 22 June 1940, three days before her loss]]

==Loss==
On 25 June 1940, ''Fraser'', her sister {{HMCS|Restigouche|H00|6}}, and the cruiser ''Calcutta'' were returning from [[St. Jean de Luz]] after rescuing refugees trapped by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] ([[Operation Ariel]]), when ''Fraser'' was rammed by ''Calcutta'' in the [[Gironde estuary]]. Struck forward of the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] by the cruiser's bow, ''Fraser'' was cut in half and sank immediately. All but 45 of the ship's crew were rescued by ''Restigouche'' and other nearby ships. Many of the survivors from ''Fraser'' transferred that later summer to {{HMCS|Margaree|H49|6}}, and were lost when that vessel sank on 22 October 1940 as a result of a collision with the freighter [[MV Port Fairy|MV ''Port Fairy'']].&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 47–48, 60&lt;/ref&gt;
