== Rename ==

Per [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Foreign terms]], I propose that this article be renamed. Rather than ''Libingan ng mga Bayani'', the article's current name, it should be named with some English phrase descriptive of its content. Following examples provided by articles listed in the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] article, I suggest naming the article [[Cemetery of the Heroes (Philippines)]], with a redirect from [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Philippines)]] and also a redirect from its current [[Tagalog language]] name. -- [[User:Wtmitchell|Boracay Bill]] ([[User talk:Wtmitchell|talk]]) 00:09, 8 December 2008 (UTC)
:I am not an expert on this article, but i must say that the most common spelling ''in English'' should be used. [[User:Masterhatch|Masterhatch]] ([[User talk:Masterhatch|talk]]) 16:41, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

The result of the proposal was '''NO CONSENSUS TO MOVE PAGE''' per discussion below. -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 00:25, 7 March 2009 (UTC)
&lt;hr/&gt;
*On December 29, 2008, I moved this article, then named ''Libingan ng mga Bayani'' to the English name ''Cemetery of the Heroes'', expecting this to be an uncontroversial move. The edit summary for the move was truncated, but said in part: &quot;... per WP:MOS#Article titles and Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English): &quot;Use the most commonly used English version of the name.&quot; (see  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libingan_ng_mga_Bayani&amp;diff=260651813&amp;oldid=260633659 here]). 
*On February 10, 2009, the article was moved back to the ''Libingan ng mga Bayani'' name, with a edit summary (also truncated) which said in part: &quot; Moved back to original title (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libingan_ng_mga_Bayani&amp;diff=269743235&amp;oldid=263204284 here]). While WP:UE says we should use the English title, the current title is not backed up by reliable sources. In addition, most English-language&quot;
*Subsequent discussion [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)#Articles with foreign-language names|here]] and [[User talk:Sky Harbor#WP:UE and article naming|here]] established a controversy over the move.
*Following on that discussion, I initiated a [[WP:RM]] request that the article be moved back to ''Cemetery of the Heroes''. That request designated this talk page section as the location for discussion of the requested move.

My position is (A) that official Wikipedia policies appear to clearly indicate that the most commonly used English version of the name of the subject should be used as the title of the article (see [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions#Use English words]] and [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]]); (B) compliance with policy is the expected norm on Wikipedia; and (C) action contrary to policy {i.e., invoking WP:IAR) requires consensus support.

As I understand the opposing position (correct me if I get this wrong), it is (A) [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], the supposed target audience for the article, prefer the Filipino name, while foreigners prefer the English name; (B) while this may be the English Wikipedia, it is '''not''' the English Wikipedia solely for those whose native language is English. (bolding in the original)

The question of [[WP:RS|reliable source]] support for ''Cemetery of the Heroes'' as the English name came up in the prior discussions. Though I am not aware of any requirement that supporting sources be cited when choosing an English article name for an article which has one or more foreign names, I'll mention some sources supporting the English name I used:

*'''Support''' This '''is''' English Wikipedia, correct? [[User:Masterhatch|Masterhatch]] ([[User talk:Masterhatch|talk]]) 05:46, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' I requested the input of other Filipino editors on the issue.  However, while this may be the English Wikipedia, there will always be cases where the English name is less common than that of the non-English name.  On this issue, I raised the issue that there are three differing translations for the name, and that there are English-language sources in the Philippines (including major newspapers like the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]) that use the Filipino name.  Which name should have more authority? --[[User:Sky Harbor|&lt;font color=&quot;#0066ff&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;Sky Harbor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Sky Harbor|&lt;font color=&quot;#0066ff&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 06:35, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
*'''Don't Support (conditional)''' In my mind the question here is not whether we should use the English term - the policy is rather clear on that matter.  If this were the only argument, I would favor using the English term, although I suggest ''Cemetery of the Heroes (Philippines)'' rather than plain ''Cemetery of the Heroes''.  It strikes me that ''Cemetery of the Heroes'' is a rather general term which would be confusing if allowed to exist on its own as an article name.  '''''However''''', I submit that the argument against making such a move would not be one of policy, but one of equivalence.  The Libingan ng mga Bayani is a single specific cemetery with a specific name, &quot;Libingan ng mga Bayani&quot; which to my knowledge is not translated into English when used in official documentation.  The usage for the term &quot;cemetery of the heroes&quot; I have seen does far tends to be more like &quot;He will be buried in our cemetery of the heroes, the &quot;Libingan ng mga Bayani&quot;. (Whereas official language will refer to a City of Manila rather than Lungsod ng Maynila, and so we use Manila in English Wikipedia.) By the same argument, the specific policy [[perestroika]] is not entered in English Wikipedia as &quot;economic restructuring.&quot; ''The translation of the term into English by media does not equivalence make.''  If we have a news source that says perestroika means &quot;restructuring&quot; (it literally does, doesn't it?), that does not mean we automatically prefer the article name &quot;Restructuring (Russia)&quot; instead.  Now, if there's an reliable source that says the official name of the specific cemetery is &quot;Libingan ng mga Bayani&quot; AND &quot;Cemetery of the Heroes&quot;, i would support a move towards ''Cemetery of the Heroes (Philippines)'', as I explained earlier.  Until then, my position is don't support.  But I'm not unreasonable in that regard and do think there's room for argument here. As it turns out, for example, [[Oath of Allegiance (Philippines)]] was written in English first, when I had thought all along that the oath's ''only'' proper name was &quot;''Panatang Makabayan''&quot;.  Having said all that... can someone please pore through the relevant legislation for the Libingan? Thanks. -- [[User:Alternativity|Alternativity]] ([[User talk:Alternativity|talk]]) 08:01, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' I found today that, apparently, the original name of the cemetery was &quot;Republic Memorial Cemetery&quot; when established on May 1947. It was renamed to &quot;Libingan ng mga Bayani&quot; by the late President Magsaysay on 27 October 1954. This is according to [http://metromanila.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/a-cemetery-of-heroes/ this source], which probably does not pass [[WP:RS]] guideline criteria; I suspect, however, that this information might be [[WP:V|verifiable]] in a [[WP:RS|reliable source]].  Anyhow, I don't think that &quot;Republic Memorial Cemetery&quot; is an appropriate English language name for this article. Even though the guideline might not strictly apply to this situation, IMHO the guidance in [[WP:DUE]] regarding prominence should be considered here. -- [[User:Wtmitchell|Boracay Bill]] ([[User talk:Wtmitchell|talk]]) 13:19, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
* '''Oppose.''' I've seen it referred to as ''Libingan ng mga Bayani'' even in English texts. One possible angle for discussion is [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], which is the official name and is a separate entity (though successor entity) from the [[Central Bank of the Philippines]]. In any case, BSP is the preferred term to be used (even in English) rather than CBP. The same case ''might'' be said for ''Libingan ng mga Bayani.'' A quick look at a [http://news.google.com/news?q=libingan+ng+mga+bayani Google News search for ''Libingan''] shows that English news sources still use the Filipino name. I say, go with the term that English news sources use. --[[User:Seav|seav]] ([[User talk:Seav|talk]]) 17:26, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
**In addition, here's the [http://server.pvao.mil.ph/libingan.html official web page] of the ''Libingan'' at the Philippine Veteran Affairs Office. Note that the website and the web page are in English, but the term used is still ''Libingan ng mga Bayani.'' --[[User:Seav|seav]] ([[User talk:Seav|talk]]) 17:31, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''.''English name'' is ''name used in English'', not necessarily translation into English. We use ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' and [[Yasukuni Shrine]], on this principle. But this means &quot;What do English sources (anywhere in the world) usually call it?&quot;; so [[Manila Cathedral]], not [[Katedral ng Maynila]]. [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Pmanderson|PMAnderson]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:11, 2 March 2009 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' until RS says that this is the real English translation. I pulled up two republic acts, [http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno3533.html] and [http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno8491.htm]. Both call the site ''Libingan ng mga Bayani'' despite having the acts written in English--[[User:Lenticel|&lt;span style=&quot;color: teal; background: white; font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Lenticel&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Lenticel|&lt;span style=&quot;color: green; font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 12:24, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' per Lenticel and Seav. It's referred to as &quot;Libingan ng mga Bayani&quot; even in English context. [[User:TheCoffee|TheCoffee]] ([[User talk:TheCoffee|talk]]) 20:09, 2 March 2009 (UTC)
*'''Note:''' Is it possible that the result of the discussion be applied to the [[University of the City of Manila]], more known even in English as the [[Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila]]? Even in English reports the name &quot;[[Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila]]&quot; is used or the PLM acronym. &amp;ndash;'''[[User:Howard the Duck|&lt;font color=&quot;#FFA500&quot;&gt;Howard&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|&lt;font color=&quot;#FFA500&quot;&gt;the&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Howard the Duck|&lt;font color=&quot;#FFA500&quot;&gt;Duck&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 01:51, 3 March 2009 (UTC)
*'''Minor comment.''' If you really want to be strict about it, the proper English translation of &quot;libingan&quot; is &quot;burial ground&quot;, not &quot;cemetery&quot;, which is &quot;sementeryo&quot; in Tagalog. :-) --[[User:Seav|seav]] ([[User talk:Seav|talk]]) 02:42, 3 March 2009 (UTC)
**'''added comment.''' Yes, but [[Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(use_English)]] doesn't speak of proper English translations. Rather, it says, &quot;Use the most commonly used English version of the name of the subject as the title of the article, as you would find it in [[WP:SOURCES|verifiable reliable sources]] (for example [[Wikipedia:NCGN#Widely_accepted_name|other encyclopedias and reference works]]).&quot; I cited some sources above which use &quot;Cemetery of the Heroes&quot;. -- [[User:Wtmitchell|Boracay Bill]] ([[User talk:Wtmitchell|talk]]) 22:38, 3 March 2009 (UTC)
***I know. That's why the comment is labeled as minor and there's a smiley at the end. I wasn't being serious. :-) --[[User:Seav|seav]] ([[User talk:Seav|talk]]) 05:41, 5 March 2009 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' The native name appears to be more common in contemporary web searches of English language web pages. There is no requirement to translate a name to English if the native name is widely used in English texts. --[[User:Polaron|Polaron]] | [[User talk:Polaron|Talk]] 15:26, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

If this phrase is considered a Filipino-language phrase, then it must be translated: &quot;If there is no established English-language treatment for a name, translate it if this can be done without loss of accuracy and with greater understanding for the English-speaking reader&quot; ([[WP:TITLE]]). This phrase is simply Filipino for &quot;Cemetery of Heroes&quot;, so there is no question of the English language lacking ''[[le mot juste]]'' to describe it.

::::On the link from the Office of the Vice-President, it seems to clarify what the Libingan ng mga Bayani is, but I interpreted it as not being the name of it per se.  The thing that I object from the move is the attempt to establish an official name for the cemetery in English when there isn't one in legal jurisprudence or even in common usage in the Philippines: clarifications on what the Libingan is in English is usually done for the benefit of non-Filipinos, either in print, broadcast or digital media.  [[WP:TITLE]] says &quot;Use English titles where they exist&quot;, but that doesn't mean that we have to start guessing the &quot;most appropriate English title&quot; under the guise of following policy. --[[User:Sky Harbor|&lt;font color=&quot;#0066ff&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;Sky Harbor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Sky Harbor|&lt;font color=&quot;#0066ff&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 12:26, 26 January 2012 (UTC)
:::::&quot;If there is no established English-language treatment for a name, translate it if this can be done without loss of accuracy and with greater understanding for the English-speaking reader,&quot; according to [[WP:TITLE]]. Lack of an establish English usage is a not a reason to use a name incomprehensible to English speakers. Many sources translate the name of this subject as either, &quot;national heroes' cemetery,&quot; or as &quot;heroes' cemetery&quot;. Yeah, I did say all this in the nomination. But I say the personal touch never hurts. [[User:Kauffner|Kauffner]] ([[User talk:Kauffner|talk]]) 13:05, 26 January 2012 (UTC)
::::::The same policy also says &quot;If there are too few English-language sources to constitute an established usage, follow the conventions of the language appropriate to the subject (German for German politicians, Portuguese for Brazilian towns, and so on).&quot;  As far as I see it, there are not enough English-language sources to constitute established usage: either the sources use the Filipino-language name (as is the case for the majority of English-language sources in the Philippines), or the Filipino name is translated into English and no single translation is predominant (as is the case for sources outside the Philippines, or for clarified sources).  Personal touches don't hurt either, but I think they also ought to be respectful of pre-existing cultural nuances: yes, Wikipedia seeks to inform everyone, but we don't do that if Filipino users will be completely unfamiliar with the name in use. --[[User:Sky Harbor|&lt;font color=&quot;#0066ff&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;Sky Harbor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Sky Harbor|&lt;font color=&quot;#0066ff&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 13:23, 26 January 2012 (UTC)

:::::::::The question here is which English-speaking reader should we ought to cater to?  While I know Filipino English speakers are a minority among the world's English speakers, I find it preposterous that in one fell swoop, Filipino names common in Philippine English suddenly have to be translated to pander to the greater audience.  Although I'm [[WP:AGF|assuming good faith]] on the part of the people who supported the move, I won't be surprised if we set a precedent where concerted efforts to move, for example, [[Batasang Pambansa]] to &quot;National Legislature&quot; or [[Lok Sabha]] to &quot;House of the People&quot;, would become prevalent because of this move: where people tend to read into policy a little too much without considering the cultural (and, by extension, linguistic) nuances behind the names in question. --[[User:Sky Harbor|&lt;font color=&quot;#0066ff&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;Sky Harbor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Sky Harbor|&lt;font color=&quot;#0066ff&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 23:35, 27 January 2012 (UTC)
I believe in using common names (see [[Big Dig]] for a tunnel project in Boston) if the common name is the clear winner.  When not, then you use the official name. It does not matter what language the name is originally from because no word is original to any language, doubly for English, which has so many [[loan word]]s. For example, America is originally Italian, Massachusetts, native American; and boondocks, Tagalog.  Clearly this is close thing.  So, which should it be?  Perhaps the question shouldn't be &quot;Which is the most common?&quot; but rather &quot;Which is the most searched for?&quot;  I suspect that ''Libingan ng mga Bayani'' is more Googled then ''Heroes' Cemetery'' since the latter is self-explanatory.  Given that neither the English nor the Tagalog is clearly the most popular and given that ''Libingan ng mga Bayani'' is more likely to be Googled, I oppose the late move and think that the original title was the correct choice. --[[User:Bruce Hall|Bruce Hall]] ([[User talk:Bruce Hall|talk]]) 15:25, 26 October 2012 (UTC)
:I agree with this analysis, but I disagree with the statement that &quot;neither the English nor the Tagalog is clearly the most popular&quot;.  The Filipino name is, by and large, the more popular name among Filipino English speakers, whether or not the name is in Filipino. --[[User:Sky Harbor|&lt;font color=&quot;#0066ff&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;Sky Harbor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Sky Harbor|&lt;font color=&quot;#0066ff&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 08:31, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
