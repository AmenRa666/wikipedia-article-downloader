== Who was Eithne?==
Does anybody have decent information about who Sigurd's mother was?
I mean, Assuming he was indeed born around 960, which would mean he had reached about the ripe age of 55 at the time of his attested death at Clontarf, any first generation offspring of Cearbhall Mc Dunlainge would have been past 70 when he was born, meaning that if Cearbhall was indeed his forebear, he would have to be his great grandfather, with possibly a generation or two more in between them. Is it likely that the word &quot;daughter&quot; by which Eithne is described would be used to mean &quot;descended of&quot;? --[[User:Svartalf|Svartalf]] ([[User talk:Svartalf|talk]]) 20:46, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

== Sigurd's wives ==

A few recent edits identified Sigurd's wives as: &quot;Thora, daughter of [[Haakon the Good]]&quot; and &quot;Olith, daughter of [[Malcolm II of Scotland]]&quot; without a reliable source. Malcolm's daughter isn't named in Sigurd's [[ODNB]] article. A marriage to a daughter of Hakon isn't mentioned at all. Malcolm's ODNB article states: &quot;It is not known whether Malcolm had any sons, but he may have had as many as three daughters. The only one whose name in known is Bethóc, who married Crínán, abbot of Dunkeld (d. 1045). Their son was Duncan I, who succeeded Malcolm as king. Another daughter of Malcolm married Sigurd (II) Hlödvisson, earl of Orkney (d. 1014), whose son was Thorfinn the Mighty, earl of Orkney&quot;.--[[User:Brianann MacAmhlaidh|Brianann MacAmhlaidh]] ([[User talk:Brianann MacAmhlaidh|talk]]) 23:52, 15 March 2016 (UTC)

:Nothing to add regarding his wives, but I do have something to add about his mother, &quot;Eđnu daughter of Kjarvalr Írakonungr&quot;. 
:I just finished Duffy's ''Brian Boru &amp; the Battle of Clontarf''. He discusses Sigurd at pp. 228-231. He makes the obvious point that the usual &quot;Kjarvalr Írakonungr&quot; ([[Cerball mac Dúnlainge]] was a bit early to be Sigurd's grandfather. Instead he suggests that [[Cerball mac Muirecáin]] would be more of the right age. And he was indeed an Irish king called &quot;Kjarvalr&quot;. He points out that this would have made [[Máel Morda mac Murchada]] of Clontarf Sigurd's first cousin. 
:Worth including? [[User:Angusmclellan|Angus McLellan]]  [[User talk:Angusmclellan|(Talk)]] 23:03, 16 March 2016 (UTC)

::Definitely worth noting. I don't have that book but i've read a few pages of it on Google Books. I think I've seen someone else identify Kjarvalr Írakonungr with Cerball mac Muirecáin, but I can't remember where I read it. I thought it might have been Woolf, but in ''Pictland to Alba'' (pp. 282-283) he tackles the chronology problem from a different angle. He suggests that ''Orkneyinga saga'' has confused Sigurd the Stout with the like-named [[Sigurd Eysteinsson]]: if the latter Sigurd was indeed a grandson of Kjarvalr Írakonungr, it could explain the claim by ''Landnámabók'' that Sigurd Eysteinsson was a close ally of [[Thorstein the Red]], because Thorstein was married to a granddaughter of Kjarvalr Írakonungr.

::In ''Viking Empires'', in a chapter that appears to have been written by Richard Oram, Sigurd the Stout's mother is identified as &quot;Cerball, son of Lorcán, son of Donnchad, the heir to Leinster&quot; without explanation (p. 225).

::Downham in &quot;The career of Cerball mac Dúnlainge, overking of the Osraige&quot;, in ''No Horns on their Helmets?'' (p. 96), avaliable her Academia.edu page [https://www.academia.edu/2317542/No_Horns_on_their_Helmet_Essays_on_the_Insular_Viking_Age], just notes that the claim of Sigurd's mother being a grandaughter of Cerball is &quot;chronologically implausible&quot;.--[[User:Brianann MacAmhlaidh|Brianann MacAmhlaidh]] ([[User talk:Brianann MacAmhlaidh|talk]]) 22:31, 20 March 2016 (UTC)

:::Thanks! I shall have a look at that link (although I should have the book Downham's paper comes from somewhere). As for Oram's bloke, he belonged to one of the many branches of Síl nÁedo Sláine and was killed by Congalach Cnogba in 946, so not a Leinsterman except in the geographical sense. The Congalach article, being sketchy at best, doesn't even mention him. [[User:Angusmclellan|Angus McLellan]]  [[User talk:Angusmclellan|(Talk)]] 00:02, 21 March 2016 (UTC)</text>
