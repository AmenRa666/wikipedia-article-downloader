[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''Michael John Dawson Walker, Baron Walker of Aldringham''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|CMG|CBE|DL}} (born 7 July 1944)&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt; is a retired [[British Army]] officer. Commissioned in 1966, he served in Cyprus, [[Northern Ireland]], and in a variety of staff posts in the United Kingdom until 1984. After being given command of a battalion, he was [[mentioned in despatches]] for his service during a second tour of duty in Northern Ireland, this time in [[Derry]], and subsequently served a tour on Gibraltar. He was promoted to [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]], unusually having never held the rank of [[colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]], and took command of [[20th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|20th Armoured Brigade]] in Germany before becoming [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] chief of staff.

As a [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major general]], Walker was appointed [[General Officer Commanding]], [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern District]], before becoming [[Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff]] at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. He took command of [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] (ARRC), which deployed to the Balkans in 1995, Walker becoming the first officer to command the land component of the NATO-led [[IFOR|Implementation Force]]. For his service with the multi-national forces in the Balkans, he was awarded the American [[Legion of Merit]]. After relinquishing command of the ARRC, Walker spent three years as [[Commander in Chief, Land Command]], before being appointed [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]]—the professional head of the British Army—in 2000. In 2003, he was promoted to [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] (CDS)—the professional head of all the British Armed Forces. While CDS, Walker attracted controversy during the modernisation of the armed forces, over allegations of prisoner abuse during the [[Iraq War]], and over comments that the media coverage of Iraq may have endangered British troops.

Walker retired in 2006 and was subsequently appointed Governor of the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], a post he held until 2011. He is married and has three children.

==Early and personal life==
Born in [[Salisbury, Zimbabwe|Salisbury]] in the British colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]] (modern-day [[Zimbabwe]]) to William Hampden Dawson Walker and Dorothy Helena Walker (née Shiach), Walker was educated both in Southern Rhodesia and in [[Yorkshire]], first at Milton School, [[Bulawayo]], and then at [[Woodhouse Grove School]], [[West Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WW&quot;&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U38598 &quot;Walker of Aldringham&quot;], ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' 2011, [[A &amp; C Black]], 2011; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2010. Retrieved 5 May 2011. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent 18 months teaching in a [[Preparatory school (UK)|Preparatory School]] before joining the [[British Army]]. Walker married Victoria (&quot;Tor&quot;, née Holme), in 1973 and the couple have three children—two sons and one daughter. He lists his interests as sailing, shooting, tennis, skiing and golf.&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2148854.stm|title=A lifetime of service|date=24 July 2002|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early military career==
After attending the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], Walker was commissioned into the [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] as a [[second lieutenant]] on 29 July 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44126|supp=yes|startpage=10603|endpage=10604|date=29 September 1966|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a [[platoon commander]] with the 1st Battalion and was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 29 January 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44513|supp=yes|startpage=1182|date=26 January 1968|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 he was posted to [[Cyprus]] for a two-year tour, and served in [[Northern Ireland]] during [[The Troubles]],&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt; before attending the [[Staff College, Camberley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WW&quot;/&gt; He was promoted to [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 29 July 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=45738|supp=yes|startpage=9157|date=31 July 1972|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=49055|supp=yes|startpage=9458|date=19 July 1982|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving in a staff position at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD), Walker was promoted to [[major (United Kingdom)|major]] at the end of 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=47117|supp=yes|startpage=362|date=10 January 1977|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rejoined 1st Battalion, to become a [[company commander]], based in [[Tidworth Camp|Tidworth]], [[Wiltshire]]. In 1979, he took up another staff post at the MoD, after which he was promoted to [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] in 1982. Until 1985, he served as [[Military Assistant]] (MA) to the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt; He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the New Year Honours List in December 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=49969|supp=yes|startpage=5|date=31 December 1984|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In command of the 1st Battalion from 1985 to 1987,&lt;ref name=&quot;WW&quot;/&gt; Walker served another tour in Northern Ireland, this time in [[Derry]], and later a tour on [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt; He was [[mentioned in despatches]] in 1987 &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished service&quot; in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=50891|supp=yes|startpage=5016|date=13 April 1987|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, Walker was promoted directly to [[brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]] at the end of 1987, without having held the rank of [[colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=51194|supp=yes|startpage=303|date=11 January 1988|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took command of [[20th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|20th Armoured Brigade]], based in Germany, from 1987 to 1989, before holding the post of [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]], [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] between 1989 and 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;WW&quot;/&gt;

==High command==
Walker attained [[general officer]] status with promotion to acting [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|major general]] in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=52697|supp=yes|startpage=16455|date=28 October 1991|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took command of North East District and [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Infantry Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;number10&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page10480.asp| title= Biography at number10.gov.uk| accessdate=2006-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having served in the [[Gulf War]], he was promoted to [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) later in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=52588|supp=yes|startpage=23|date=28 June 1991|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted the substantive rank of major general on 2 December 1991, with seniority from 14 February 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=52798|supp=yes|startpage=937|date=20 January 1992|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; going on to serve as [[General Officer Commanding]] of the Eastern District and then as [[Assistant Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Assistant Chief of the General Staff]] from 11 December 1992 to 3 October 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=53135|supp=yes|startpage=21058|date=14 December 1992|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=53807|supp=yes|startpage=13865|date=3 October 1994|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 1994, Walker was appointed commander of [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] (ARRC), which had its headquarters in [[JHQ Rheindahlen|Rheindahlen]], Germany, and promoted to acting [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|lieutenant general]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=53874|supp=yes|startpage=17415|date=12 December 1994|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted the substantive rank of lieutenant general on 15 March 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=53986|supp=yes|startpage=4331|date=20 March 1995|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[knighthood|knighted]] in the 1995 Queen's Birthday Honours when he was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=54066|supp=yes|startpage=2|date=16 June 1995|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Walker's command, the ARRC deployed to the Balkans in December 1995. There, he became the first commander of the land component of the [[NATO]]-led [[IFOR|Implementation Force]] (IFOR), until his return to the UK in November 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt;

His IFOR command in Bosnia was indirectly criticised by [[Richard Holbrooke]] for his refusal to use his ''authority'' to also perform nonmilitary implementation tasks, including arresting indicted war criminals:
{{quote|Based on [[John Shalikashvili|Shalikashvili]]'s statement at White House meetings, [[Warren Christopher|Christopher]] and I had assumed that the IFOR commander would use his ''authority'' to do substantially more than he was ''obligated'' to do. The meeting with [Admiral Leighton] [[Leighton W. Smith|Smith]] shattered that hope. Smith and his British deputy, General Michael Walker, made clear that they intended to take a minimalist approach to all aspects of implementation other than force protection. Smith signalled this in his first extensive public statement to the Bosnian people, during a live call-in program on Pale Television – an odd choice for his first local media appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Holbrooke]], ''To End a War'', p.327-329&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Challenger1MBT.JPEG|thumb|left|Walker served as commander of the land component of the NATO-led Implementation Force in Bosnia]]
He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] at the end of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=54625|supp=yes|startpage=4|date=30 December 1996|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Succeeded as COMARRC by [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Sir Mike Jackson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=54662|supp=yes|startpage=1092|date=27 January 1997|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker was promoted to acting [[general (United Kingdom)|general]] and appointed [[Commander in Chief, Land Command]] on 27 January 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He was granted the substantive rank of general on 2 April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=54726|supp=yes|startpage=4170|date=7 April 1997|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his service with IFOR between 1995 and 1996, Walker was awarded the American [[Legion of Merit]] (Degree of Commander), and granted unrestricted permission to wear the decoration, in May 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=54763|supp=yes|startpage=5628|date=13 May 1997|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1997, he was appointed [[Aide-de-Camp]] General to [[Queen Elizabeth II]], succeeding General [[Michael Rose (British Army officer)|Sir Michael Rose]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=54881|supp=yes|startpage=9955|date=1 September 1997|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he in turn was succeeded by General [[Richard Dannatt, Baron Dannatt|Sir Richard Dannatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=58008|supp=yes|startpage=8065|date=13 June 2006|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in the New Year Honours List at the end of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=55710|supp=yes|startpage=2|date=31 December 1999|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chief of the General Staff.svg|thumb|The flag of the Chief of the General Staff.]]
Having served just over three years as Commander-in-Chief, Walker was appointed [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS)—the professional head of the British Army—on 17 April 2000, taking over from General [[Roger Wheeler (British Army officer)|Sir Roger Wheeler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=55823|supp=yes|startpage=4372|date=18 April 2000|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained CGS for three years, after which he was promoted to [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] (CDS)—the professional head of all the British Armed Forces—on 2 May 2003, succeeding [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Michael Boyce, Baron Boyce|Sir Michael Boyce]] (later Lord Boyce).&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=56992|supp=yes|startpage=8463|date=8 July 2003|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As CDS, Walker criticised some of the media coverage of British deployments in Iraq. In particular, he claimed that attacks on the [[Black Watch]] were &quot;enhanced&quot; due to news reports on their location. He went on to say that &quot;[as a result of the media coverage], there could well have been a response by those who wished us ill to go and meet us with something like a bomb&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4083939.stm|title=Media blamed for Iraq attacks|date=10 December 2004|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comments were rejected by a spokesman for the [[National Union of Journalists]], who retaliated &quot;When generals turn around and start blaming reporters for their own mistakes, it is a sign they aren't doing their own jobs properly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4085297.stm|title=Journalists reject Iraq criticism|date=10 December 2004|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2004, Walker, along with General [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Sir Mike Jackson]], then Chief of the General Staff, attracted controversy over reforms of the armed forces, which included the amalgamation of several army regiments to form larger regiments, leading to the loss of historic names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3915747.stm|title=Forces chief backs defence cuts|date=22 July 2004|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SaddamStatue.jpg|thumb|left|Walker advised the British Government during the Iraq War]]
In an interview with the BBC in October 2005, Walker suggested that the army's recruitment had been adversely affected by the Iraq War. He also commented on the war in Afghanistan, on which he said &quot;There's a lot of work to be done, of which the military is only a very small part. Ten years, 15 years, long-term. This is not going to be solved in a short term&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4359448.stm|title=General rules out Iraq exit date|date=20 October 2005|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, he gave an interview for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', in which he said that soldiers' morale had been damaged by the unpopularity of the war among the British public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article573721.ece|title=Army chief says guilt factor is hitting morale|date=2 October 2005|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2005, Walker was instrumental in drawing up new procedures for the treatment of British service personnel accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners, following claims that the army had abandoned those soldiers charged in connection with the prisoner abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/nov/06/iraq.military|title=Army: 'we let down Iraq troops'|last=Townsend|first=Mark|date=6 November 2005|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, Walker headed up a military delegation to Bulgaria to discuss military cooperation between the British and Bulgarian governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=59812|title=UK Defense Chief Greeted in Bulgaria|date=27 February 2006|agency=Sofia News Agency|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker [[List of witnesses of The Iraq Inquiry#1 February|gave evidence]] to the [[Iraq Inquiry]] on 1 February 2010, in which he spoke about funding for the invasion of Iraq and subsequent planning.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Iraq inquiry&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8491277.stm|title=Ministers told of Iraq kit risk&amp;nbsp;— armed forces chief|date=1 February 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honorary roles===
Lord Walker has held a variety of honorary and ceremonial roles in different regiments.

==Arms==
{{Infobox COA wide
|image = 
|image size = 
|notes = 
|year_adopted = 2008
|coronet = [[Coronet|Coronet of a Baron]]
|escutcheon = Per pale Azure and Gules an Orle fracted and there conjoined to two Chevronels couped between four Acorns slipped Or
|crest = Upon a Helm with a Wreath Or and Gules issuing from a Mural Crown Or a Cocker Spaniel's Head Azure in the mouth three Pheasant Feathers Or
|supporters = On either side a Helmeted Guinea Fowl Azure beaked casqued and semy of Roundels Or the neck and wattles Gules
|badge = Two Arms in Armour embowed downwards and conjoined at the shoulder Argent each hand gauntleted and grasping a Rose Gules barbed seeded slipped and leaved Or
|motto = '''STABILIS ET FIDUS'''
|symbolism = The Arms are a variation on the chevronel and fracted orle theme. They are combined with the acorn, the grantee being Governor of the Royal Chelsea Hospital which was founded by Charles II and therefore associated with the acorn taken from Charles II's oak tree. The guinea fowl reflects the grantee's childhood and association with Zimbabwe, formerly Southern Rhodesia. His interest in shooting features in the Crest with a cocker spaniel's head and the pheasant feathers. The mural crown is appropriate for a General in the Army. The grantee's family have hitherto used an arm in armour grasping a rose. Two such arms have been conjoined in the Badge to suggest the initial &quot;W&quot; for Walker.
