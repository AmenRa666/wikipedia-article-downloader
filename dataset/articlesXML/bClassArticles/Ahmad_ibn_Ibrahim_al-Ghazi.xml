Ethiopian historians such as Azazh T'ino and Bahrey have written that during the period of his rise to power, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi had converted many [[Oromo people|Oromo]] pastoral people to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Glti5O1XMJ0C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=ibrahim+al+ghazi+oromo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gMb2VOibJIe5uAT3voKQCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ibrahim%20al%20ghazi%20oromo&amp;f=false {{cite book |title=Effects of Resettlement Schemes on the Biophysical and Human Environments: The Case of the Gambela Region, Ethiopia |year= 2005 |author=Mengistu Woube |publisher=Universal-Publishers | page=44}} ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation for an attack on Adal the previous year by the Abyssinian general Degalhan, Imam Ahmad invaded Abyssinia in 1529, supplementing his force with considerable numbers of muskets purchased from the Ottomans, which would panic the Abyssinian troops. Imam Ahmad maintained the discipline of most of his men, defeating Emperor [[Dawit II of Ethiopia|Lebna Dengel]] at [[Battle of Shimbra Kure|Shimbra Kure]] that March.&lt;ref&gt;The battle is described in the ''Futuh'', pp. 71-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conquest of Abyssinia==
{{Main article|Abyssinian-Adal War}}
The chronicle of Imam Ahmad's invasion of Abyssinia is depicted in various Somali, Abyssinian and other foreign sources. Imam Ahmad campaigned in Abyssinia in 1531, breaking Emperor Lebna Dengel's ability to resist in the [[Battle of Amba Sel]] on October 28. The Muslim army of Imam Ahmad then marched northward to loot the island monastery of [[Lake Hayq]] and the stone churches of [[Lalibela]]. When the Imam entered the province of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], he defeated an Abyssinian army that confronted him there. On reaching [[Axum]], he destroyed the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]], in which the Abyssinian emperors had for centuries been crowned.

The Abyssinians were forced to ask for help from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who landed at the port of [[Massawa]] on February 10, 1541, during the reign of the emperor [[Gelawdewos of Ethiopia|Gelawdewos]]. The force was led by [[Cristóvão da Gama]] and included 400 musketeers as well as a number of artisans and other non-combatants. Da Gama and Imam Ahmad met on April 1, 1542 at [[Battle of Jarte|Jarte]], which Trimingham has identified with [[Anasa]], between [[Amba Alagi]] and [[Lake Ashenge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ftid&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam in Ethiopia |year=1952 |publisher=Oxford: Geoffrey Cumberlege for the University Press |page=173 |author=J. Spencer Trimingham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhUFAQAAIAAJ&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the Portuguese had their first glimpse of Ahmad, as recorded by Castanhoso:

:While his camp was being pitched, the king of Zeila [Imam Ahmad] ascended a hill with several horse and some foot to examine us: he halted on the top with three hundred horse and three large banners, two white with red moons, and one red with a white moon, which always accompanied him, and [by] which he was recognized.&lt;ref name=&quot;cytdt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Portuguese Expedition to Abyssinia in 1541-1543 as Narrated by Castanhoso |year=1902 |author=Richard Stephen Whiteway |publisher=Hakluyt Society |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P39JAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, after the two unfamiliar armies had exchanged messages and stared at each other for a few days, da Gama formed his troops into an [[infantry square]] and marched against the Imam's lines, repelling successive waves of Muslim attacks with musket and cannon. This battle ended when Imam Ahmad was wounded in the leg by a chance shot; seeing his banners signal retreat, the Portuguese and their Abyssinian allies fell upon the disorganized Muslims, who suffered losses but managed to reform next to the river on the distant side.

Over the next several days, Imam Ahmad's forces were reinforced by arrivals of fresh troops.  Understanding the need to act swiftly, da Gama on April 16 again formed a square which he led against Imam Ahmad's camp. Although the Muslims fought with more determination than two weeks earlier—their horse almost broke the Portuguese square—an opportune explosion of some gunpowder traumatized the horses on the Imam's side, and his army fled in disorder. Castanhoso laments that &quot;the victory would have been complete this day had we only one hundred horses to finish it: for the King was carried on men's shoulders in a bed, accompanied by horsemen, and they fled in no order.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tryd&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Portuguese Expedition to Abyssinia in 1541-1543 as Narrated by Castanhoso |year=1902 |author=Richard Stephen Whiteway |publisher=Hakluyt Society |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P39JAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinforced by the arrival of the [[Bahr negus Yeshaq]], da Gama marched southward after Imam Ahmad's force, coming within sight of him ten days later. However, the onset of the [[rainy season]] prevented da Gama from engaging Ahmad a third time.  On the advice of Queen [[Sabla Wengel]], da Gama made winter camp at [[Wofla]] near Lake Ashenge, still within sight of his opponent,&lt;ref name=&quot;yugyo&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Portuguese Expedition to Abyssinia in 1541-1543 as Narrated by Castanhoso |year=1902 |author=Richard Stephen Whiteway |publisher=Hakluyt Society |page=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P39JAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Imam made his winter camp on [[Zobil mountains|Mount Zobil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cktct&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The historical geography of Abyssinia from the first century AD to 1704 |year=1989 |author=G.W.B. Huntingford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Historical_Geography_of_Ethiopia.html?id=kpIiAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing that victory lay in the number of firearms an army had, the Imam sent to his fellow Muslims for help. According to Abbé {{Interlanguage link multi|João Bermudes|pt}}, Imam Ahmad received 2000 musketeers from Arabia, and artillery and 900 picked men from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] to assist him. Meanwhile, due to casualties and other duties, da Gama's force was reduced to 300 musketeers. After the rains ended, Imam Ahmad attacked the Portuguese camp and through weight of numbers killed all but 140 of da Gama's troops. Da Gama himself, badly wounded, was captured with ten of his men and, after refusing an offer to spare his life if he would convert to Islam, was executed.&lt;ref&gt;Described in terms worthy of a saint's life by [[Jerónimo Lobo]], who based his account on the testimony of an eye witness. (''The'' Itinerário ''of Jerónimo Lobo'', translated by Donald M. Lockhart [London: Hakluyt Society, 1984], pp. 201-217)&lt;/ref&gt;

The survivors and Emperor [[Gelawdewos of Ethiopia|Gelawdewos]] were afterward able to join forces and, drawing on the Portuguese supplies of muskets, attacked Ahmad on February 21, 1543 in the [[Battle of Wayna Daga]], where their vastly outnumbered troops of 9,000 managed to defeat the 15,000 soldiers under Gragn. Gragn was killed by a Portuguese musketeer, who was mortally wounded in avenging da Gama's death.

His wife Bati del Wambara managed to escape the battlefield with a remnant of the Turkish soldiers, and they made their way back to [[Harar]], where she rallied his followers. Intent on avenging her husband's death, she married his nephew [[Nur ibn Mujahid]] on condition that Nur would avenge Imam Ahmad's defeat. In 1554-55, Nur departed on a Jihad, or Holy War, in the eastern Abyssinian lowlands of Bale, and Hadiya. In 1559, he invaded Fatagar, where he fought against the Abyssinian emperor Galawdewos, and killed him in battle. Nur continued fighting for 12 years until, according to legend, at Gibe he said &quot;Kaffa!&quot;, or &quot;Enough!&quot;, and returned to Harar.

==Legacy==
&quot;In Ethiopia the damage which Ahmad Gragn did has never been forgotten,&quot; wrote Paul B. Henze. &quot;Every Christian highlander still hears tales of Gragn in his childhood. [[Haile Selassie]] referred to him in his memoirs, &quot;I have often had villagers in northern Ethiopia point out sites of towns, forts, churches and monasteries destroyed by Gragn as if these catastrophes had occurred only yesterday.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nuihno&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia |year=2002 |author=Paul B.

==Sources==
Ahmad's invasion of Abyssinia is described in detail in the ''Futuh al-habaša'' (&quot;The Conquest of Ethiopia&quot;), written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] by Ahmad's follower Sihab ad-Din Admad ibn 'Abd-al-Qadir, in its current version incomplete, covering the story only to 1537, narrating the Imam's raids on the islands of [[Lake Tana]]. [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]] the explorer claimed that the second part could be found &quot;in Mocha or Hudaydah&quot;; but, despite later investigation, no one else has reported seeing a copy of this second part. The surviving first part was translated into [[French language|French]] by [[René Basset]] and published 1897-1901. [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] made a partial translation into English as part of his ''The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles'' (Addis Ababa: Oxford University Press, 1967), and a complete translation of the ''Futuh al-habaša'' by Paul Lester Stenhouse was published by Tsehai in 2003 (ISBN 978-0-9723172-5-2).
