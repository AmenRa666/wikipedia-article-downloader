== Map of users/potential users ==
Should I make a little map for this article showing the locations of nations which use the Bushmaster or may use it in the future? Many articles on military vehicles and aircraft have similar maps, so I think it's a good idea. [[User:CeeWhy2|CeeWhy2]] 09:41, 19 April 2007 (UTC)
:At the moment only two countries are using the Bushmaster and no other orders have been placed (I don't think that the vehicle is even in any tenders at the moment) so it wouldn't be a very dramatic map visually... --[[User:Nick Dowling|Nick Dowling]] 09:54, 19 April 2007 (UTC)
::Perhaps I should work on one for the [[HMMWV]], then. Many more users and more well-known. In the meantime, I've done up a map using information in this article:

:::http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s251/Crank_Yanker_06/bushmastermap.png?t=1176977487

::Dark blue represents current users, while light blue represents potential future users. [[User:CeeWhy2|CeeWhy2]] 10:12, 19 April 2007 (UTC)

:::I've changed the caption to the picture to state that the light blue countries are those which have evaluated the Bushmaster. Some of the trials were quite a while ago, and as no orders have followed it doesn't seem very likely that any orders will eventuate at the moment. --[[User:Nick Dowling|Nick Dowling]] 08:29, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

:: June 27 2007 - The US have announced the purchase of 1500 Bushmasters. I have added it on the main page under exports for you ;) I was going to put a reference in...but I had no idea how to :p

==Place of origin==
The infobox says &quot;Place of origin: Australia&quot; but the intro says it was designed by an Irish company. Which is correct? [[User:Grant65|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;Grant&lt;/span&gt;]] | [[User talk:Grant65|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;]] 03:11, 15 July 2007 (UTC)
:The Bushmaster was designed by an Irish company but was developed in Australia and all the vehicles have been built in Australia. I'm not sure what the criteria is for the infobox. --[[User:Nick Dowling|Nick Dowling]] 03:42, 15 July 2007 (UTC)
::I find these &quot;Place of origin&quot; things highly dubious. We don't have them for military aircraft or civilian vehicles. [[User:Grant65|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;Grant&lt;/span&gt;]] | [[User talk:Grant65|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;]] 14:46, 15 July 2007 (UTC)
:::The Bushmaster was designed in Adelaide by Perry Engineering with some support from Timoney.  It was completely redesigned in Bendigo by ADI once they had acquired the project/tender.  Timoney supplied draftsmen to help with the redesign, but the engineering design was performed in Bendigo by ADI staff.  Timoney do have some IP rights that date to their original involvement with Perry Engineering.--[[User:SRMThomas|SRMThomas]] 04:14, 23 July 2007 (UTC)
::::There is information in Hansard if someone wants to add more specifics. | [http://www.aph.gov.au/Hansard/reps/dailys/dr240697.pdf Hansard] 24 June 1997 page 97. It seems Timoney was responsible for the suspension and Stewart and Stevenson the powertrain linkup, further the design was marketed by Rockwell.

==Pics==
Does anyone know the origin (ie. licence) of these pics: [http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showpost.php?p=2790982&amp;postcount=4108]. It'd make a great addition to the article. - [[User:Htra0497|Htra0497]] 09:54, 28 October 2007 (UTC)
:They weren't released by the Australian Department of Defence. I'd suggest that you contact the person who uploaded them - you can ask if they give permission for them to be uploaded onto Wikipedia or Wikicommons. --[[User:Nick Dowling|Nick Dowling]] 09:56, 28 October 2007 (UTC)
:::The first pic is property of the Dutch ministry of defense, the second pic is a personal one from someone in theatre. Here is another one from the Dutch MOD: [http://www.mindef.nl/missies/afghanistan/actueel/2007/11/20071120_extra_bushmasters.aspx]. I mailed the webmaster to ask for permission to use the picture for this article. [[User:EggyNL|EggyNL]]
::::I got an email back. Pictures from the ministry of defense website can be used for wikipedia articles as long as the source is mentioned.

==Fair use rationale for Image:OBW Bushmaster ADF.jpg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:OBW Bushmaster ADF.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:OBW Bushmaster ADF.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;

== Blacklisted Links Found on the Main Page ==
Cyberbot II has detected that page contains external links that have either been globally or locally blacklisted.
Links tend to be blacklisted because they have a history of being spammed, or are highly innappropriate for Wikipedia.
This, however, doesn't necessarily mean it's spam, or not a good link.
If the link is a good link, you may wish to request whitelisting by going to the [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist|request page for whitelisting]].
If you feel the link being caught by the blacklist is a false positive, or no longer needed on the blacklist, you may request the regex be removed or altered at the [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-blacklist|blacklist request page]].
If the link is blacklisted globally and you feel the above applies you may request to whitelist it using the before mentioned request page, or request its removal, or alteration, at the [[meta:Talk:Spam Blacklist|request page on meta]].
When requesting whitelisting, be sure to supply the link to be whitelisted and wrap the link in nowiki tags.
The whitelisting process can take its time so once a request has been filled out, you may set the invisible parameter on the tag to true.
Please be aware that the bot will replace removed tags, and will remove misplaced tags regularly.

'''Below is a list of links that were found on the main page:'''

*&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.army-technology.com/projects/bushmaster/&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*:''Triggered by &lt;code&gt;\barmy-technology\.com\b&lt;/code&gt; on the local blacklist''

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=699701737 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20060821092214/http://www.adi-limited.com/pdfs/ADI1457_ADI_Pursuit_66.pdf to http://www.adi-limited.com/pdfs/ADI1457_ADI_Pursuit_66.pdf

When you have finished reviewing my changes, please set the ''checked'' parameter below to '''true''' to let others know.

{{sourcecheck|checked=false}}

Cheers.—[[User:Cyberbot II|&lt;sup style=&quot;color:green;font-family:Courier&quot;&gt;cyberbot II]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub style=&quot;margin-left:-14.9ex;color:green;font-family:Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Cyberbot II|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Talk to my owner]]:Online&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 22:55, 13 January 2016 (UTC)</text>
