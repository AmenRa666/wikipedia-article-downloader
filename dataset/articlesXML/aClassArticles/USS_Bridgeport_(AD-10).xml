'''USS ''Bridgeport'' (AD-10/ID-3009)''' was a [[destroyer tender]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]] and the years after. She was a twin-screw, steel-hulled passenger and cargo steamship built in 1901 at [[Bremen-Vegesack|Vegesack]], Germany as '''SS ''Breslau''''' of the [[North German Lloyd]] line. ''Breslau'' was one of the seven ships of the ''Köln'' class of ships built for the [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] route.

Interned at [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] at the outbreak of World War I, ''Breslau'' was seized in 1917 by the United States after her entry into the war and commissioned into the Navy as USS ''Bridgeport''. Originally slated to be a repair ship, she was reclassified as a destroyer tender the following year. ''Bridgeport'' completed several transatlantic convoy crossings before she was stationed at [[Brest, France]], where she remained in a support role after the end of World War I. After returning to the United States in November 1919, she spent the next five years along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and in the [[Caribbean]] tending destroyers and conducting training missions. She was decommissioned in November 1924 and placed in reserve at the [[Boston Navy Yard]].

After being struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in October 1941, and a brief, unsuccessful attempt at merchant service early in [[World War II]], she was transferred to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] for use by the [[United States Army]] in November 1942. The ship was selected for employment as a [[Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention]] hospital ship and renamed '''USAHS ''Larkspur'''''. She made three round trips to the [[United Kingdom]] before an extended tour of duty in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].

In January 1946, she was converted into transport ship '''USAT ''Bridgeport''''', destined for returning [[war bride]]s and other military dependents from overseas. She continued in this role until laid up in the [[Reserve Fleet]] at [[Brunswick, Georgia]], in 1947. ''Bridgeport'' was sold as surplus in February 1948 and broken up for scrap later that year at [[Mobile, Alabama]].

==SS ''Breslau''==
''Breslau'' was built in 1901 by the [[Bremer Vulkan]] yard at Vegesack for the North German Lloyd line as the fourth of seven ships of the ''Köln'' class.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-264 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-190 /&gt; The ''Köln''-class ships, all named after German cities, were designed for the [[Bremen]] to Baltimore and Galveston route, and were specially fitted for [[steerage]] traffic.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-190&gt;Drechsel (1994), Volume 1, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NDL-56&gt;Norddeutscher Lloyd (1927), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the class was designed with accommodations for 120 cabin-class passengers and up to 1,850 steerage passengers for service from Germany, ''Breslau'''s capacity was somewhat lower, with room for 66 cabin-class and 1,660 in steerage.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-264 /&gt;&lt;!-- ←Breslau specifics --&gt;&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-190 /&gt;&lt;!-- ←Köln-class general --&gt; The ''Köln''-class steerage compartments had portholes for better light and ventilation than was typical, and included cabins that housed from four to ten passengers. ''Köln''-class ships were specially designed to carry large freight loads on return voyages to Germany, with holds customized for carrying wheat and cotton.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-190 /&gt;

''Breslau'' was a 7,524-ton steel-hulled vessel built with twin [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|quadruple expansion]] [[steam engine]]s that generated {{convert|3600|hp|lk=in|0}}&lt;!-- not clear from source if 3600 hp total or each--&gt; and drove twin screws that moved the ship at a {{convert|12|kn|adj=on|lk=in}} pace.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-264 /&gt;&lt;!-- ←everything else --&gt;&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;!-- ←steel-hulled --&gt; Her length as built was {{convert|136.36|m|ftin|sp=us}} with a beam of {{convert|16.46|m|ft|sp=us|0}}.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-264 /&gt; She had a single funnel, two masts, was outfitted with an awning deck, and was staffed by 94 to 120 crew members, depending upon the route and season.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-264 /&gt;&lt;!-- ←crew --&gt;&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-190 /&gt;&lt;!-- ←awning deck --&gt;&lt;!-- ←funnel, masts --&gt;

After launching on 14 August 1901, ''Breslau'' sailed to [[New York City|New York]] on her [[maiden voyage]] on 23 November of that same year.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-1-264 /&gt; In April 1902, she sailed on the Bremen to Baltimore route for the first time, and in September 1903, added Galveston to her itinerary. In March 1910, the liner was moved to the Bremen–[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] run.&lt;ref name=ImmShip&gt;Bonsor (1975), Volume II, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 1913, while making an intermediate stop in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], ''Breslau'' was being [[Warping (sailing)|warped]] into position when an electrical fire broke out at the pier where she was docking. ''Breslau'' made an emergency departure into the [[Hudson River]], during which time the blaze was extinguished. The ship was not damaged and none of the 1,500 passengers aboard were injured in the incident. The ship left for Philadelphia on schedule the next day.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&amp;res=9C01E1D9153FE633A25752C2A9619C946296D6CF | title = Hauled From Blazing Pier.; Incoming Liner Breslau Menaced by Flames as She Docks in Hoboken. | date = 21 July 1913 | page = 1 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2010-02-21 | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1914, ''Breslau'' was shifted to a Bremen to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] run. She left Bremen on 8 July 1914 for what turned out to be her last voyage for North German Lloyd. She landed at New York on 24 July after stops at [[Emden]] and Boston. After continuing on to New Orleans, ''Breslau'' was [[internment|interned]] there after the [[German Empire]] had declared war, entering [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=ImmShip /&gt;

==World War I==
&quot;Upon the entrance of the United States into World War I, customs officials seized ''Breslau'', but not before her German crew had wrought considerable damage to her machinery. She was assigned Identification Number (Id. No.) 3009, renamed ''Bridgeport'' on 9 June 1917, and commissioned on 25 August 1917 with [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lt. Comdr.]] Albert B. Randall, [[United States Naval Reserve Forces|USNRF]], in command.&quot;&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt; Originally intended to be a repair ship, ''Bridgeport'' was reclassified as a [[destroyer tender]] (AD-10) on 1 March 1918 while under repair in the [[Boston Navy Yard]] between 13 September 1917 and 9 March 1918. &quot;During this time, eight 5-inch guns and two machine guns replaced her original battery of four {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} guns.&quot;&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;

On 15 April, ''Bridgeport'' departed New York for the [[Azores]] in company with thirty {{convert|110|ft|adj=on}} [[submarine chaser]]s that formed the convoy; four U.S. Navy and two [[French Navy|French]] tugs were included to provide towing assistance if needed, while {{USS|Salem|CL-3|2}} and the armed yacht {{USS|Wadena|SP-158|2}} provided an escort; ''Bridgeport'' and the [[replenishment oiler]] {{USS|Arethusa|AO-7|2}} were included to provide support. &quot;The British submarine [[HMCS CH-14|HMS ''H-14'']] rounded out the group and gave it a truly [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] character.&quot;&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; &quot;Not long out of port, however, a collision reduced the numbers by two when ''H-14'' collided with ''Arethusa'', necessitating the former's return to Bermuda at the end of a towline astern of tug {{USS|Conestoga|AT-54|2}} on 18 April. That same day, ''Bridgeport'' coaled tug {{USS|Montcalm|AT-39|2}} while underway; on 19 April, she towed the ailing {{USS|Bagaduce|AT-21|2}}, and, as necessary, the submarine chaser {{USS|SC-255||2}} on 24 April and {{USS|SC-142||2}} on the day following, proving her versatility.&quot;&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Reaching [[Ponta Delgada]] on the afternoon of 27 April, ''Bridgeport'' spent the remainder of April and the first two weeks of May in the Azores. Her log reflects the multi-faceted work of a ship of her type, one that was becoming increasingly important as the U.S. Navy expanded to meet the challenge imposed by a World War. Reflecting the true allied nature of her calling, ''Bridgeport'' sent repair parties to several ships three days after her arrival, 30 April, ranging from the American armed yacht ''Wadena'' and submarine chaser [[USS SC-277|''SC-277'']] to the [[Italy|Italian]] steamship ''Virginia'' and the French tug ''Rene''. She fitted out her no. 2 motor launch to patrol the anchorage on 11 May, arming it with a [[Lewis Gun|machine gun]] and a [[depth charge]], and two days later issued 100 depth charges to {{USS|Marietta|PG-15|2}}. Underway on the morning of 14 May on the first leg of her homeward voyage, ''Bridgeport'' paused briefly at Grassy Bay from 21 to 26 May, and after picking up tug ''Conestoga'' and minesweeper {{USS|Lykens|SP-876|2}} on 26 May, ultimately reached [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] on 29 May.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Early in June, ''Bridgeport'' made a round-trip voyage to [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], arriving back at New London on 23 June. She took on cargo and got underway on 28 June in a convoy of 18 subchasers and other vessels, bound for Europe by way of Bermuda and the Azores. Throughout the crossing, ''Bridgeport'' provided medical assistance and repair work as required.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

There are four smaller ships beside Bridgeport, two on each side.|A view of USS ''Bridgeport'' at Brest in 1918, taken from {{USS|Rambler|SP-211|2}}]] 
At 05:13 on 5 August, ''Bridgeport''{{'}}s lookouts spotted [[Ushant]] [[lighthouse|Light]]. At 06:40, [[USS SC-48|''SC-48'']] sighted a torpedo and sounded a warning. Two minutes later, men on board the tender saw the torpedo wake on ''Bridgeport'''s port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. ''Bridgeport'' swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern observed the torpedo disappear on the port side and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot in the direction of the torpedo—which broached on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. ''Bridgeport'' ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

''Bridgeport''{{'}}s lookouts later spied what looked like a submarine periscope some {{convert|2000|yd}} distant on the starboard bow. Putting on full right rudder, the ship commenced firing with her starboard battery while four subchasers hurried to the spot. She fired 22&amp;nbsp;rounds, but apparently to no avail. ''Bridgeport'' and her consorts reached [[Brest, France|Brest]] shortly afterward.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Designated the &quot;parent ship&quot; for destroyers based there, ''Bridgeport'' remained at Brest through the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]] and into the autumn of 1919. ''Bridgeport'' was the third such ship sent to French waters, and her arrival in August 1918 freed {{USS|Panther|1889|2}} to attend to urgent repair work in the [[Gironde estuary|Gironde River]]. ''Bridgeport'' and {{USS|Prometheus|AR-3|2}} not only maintained the various types of patrol craft operating with the patrol force but also supported troop transports and cargo vessels arriving in France.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

==Interwar period==
After the end of hostilities, ''Bridgeport'' joined in the salute to President [[Woodrow Wilson]] when he arrived at Brest on 13 December 1918 on board the transport {{USS|George Washington|1908|2}}.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Underway for England on the afternoon of 15 October 1919, ''Bridgeport'' arrived at [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] the following day and remained there until she sailed for New York on 26 October. En route to the United States on 3 November, the destroyer tender spotted the American merchant steamer SS ''Avondale'' with her engineering plant disabled, and sent over a repair party. Various machinery components were repaired in the tender's shops as ''Bridgeport'''s boat shuttled between the two ships carrying parts and workmen. By the following afternoon, ''Avondale'' was able to proceed under her own power, and the two ships parted company. ''Bridgeport'' reached the New York Navy Yard on 11 November and remained there into 1920.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Attached to Destroyer Squadron&amp;nbsp;3, Flotilla&amp;nbsp;2, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, ''Bridgeport'' departed New York on 6 February for [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]], where the fleet concentrated for winter maneuvers. Underway for [[Kingston, Jamaica]], on 17 February, she remained there until 24 February. During the destroyer force's departure from Kingston, {{USS|Dixie|1893|2}} ran aground. ''Bridgeport'' stood in to assist her and succeeded in working ''Dixie'' out of her predicament. They reached Guantanamo Bay on 26 February. A month later, ''Bridgeport'' helped another grounded ship. She left Guantanamo Bay on 26 March bound for [[Gulf of Guacanayabo|Guacanayabo]] near [[Manzanillo, Cuba|Manzanillo]]. On 27 March, the destroyer tender encountered the British merchantman SS ''Crostafels'' that had run aground off Ceiba Bank and set about to assist her in getting off the bank. {{USS|Schenck|DD-159|2}} joined in the effort not long thereafter, and together the two American warships had ''Crostafels'' afloat again.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

After visiting Guacanayabo and [[Cienfuegos]] late in March and early in April, ''Bridgeport'' moved to Manzanillo and remained nearby until setting sail for New York on 24 April. She arrived at New York on 30 April for several days of upkeep and liberty before moving on to her summer base. On 17 May, she sailed for [[Naval Station Newport|Newport, Rhode Island]], the summer base for the destroyer squadrons, and arrived there the following day to tend the destroyers of Flotilla&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Departing Newport on 31 May, ''Bridgeport'' arrived at the [[Boston Navy Yard]] the next day and remained there through July, undergoing repairs and alterations. During this refit, on 17 July 1920, she received the designation AD-10 when the Navy adopted the alphanumeric system of hull classification and identification. Her battery underwent its third change when her {{convert|5|in|0|adj=on}} guns were upgraded from the 40-[[Caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|caliber]] to the 51-caliber model. ''Bridgeport'' remained in the yard until 20 August, when she returned to Newport. Back at New York at the end of the month, ''Bridgeport'' received orders to join in the rescue effort for submarine {{USS|S-5|SS-110|2}} that had sunk off the [[Delaware capes]] during post-overhaul trials. The destroyer tender left the anchorage off [[Tompkinsville, Staten Island|Tompkinsville]] late on 2 September and reached the scene late the following morning. ''Bridgeport'' remained in the vicinity until late the next day when she headed back to New York to reembark some of her crewmen left behind as a result of her hasty departure.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

''Bridgeport'' sailed for Charleston on 8 September, and reached that port on 14 September to serve the destroyers based there. The ship remained at Charleston into the early part of May 1921 when she sailed for New York, accompanying the fleet's destroyers northward to the [[Narragansett Bay]] operating areas. After a visit to New York City from 14 to 31 May 1921, ''Bridgeport'' arrived at Newport on 1 June and remained there, tending destroyers, into late September. She then spent the first half of October at the New York Navy Yard. Returning to Charleston on 15 October, ''Bridgeport'' worked there into late December, when she returned to the New York Navy Yard for the rest of 1921.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

The year 1922 found ''Bridgeport'' continuing her service on the East Coast, mostly between Narragansett Bay and Hampton Roads, tending destroyers and assisting in destroyer target practices on the Southern Drill Grounds off the [[Virginia Capes]]. She visited the city for which she was named, [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], between 25 and 30 October. After a busy year's operations, she arrived at the Boston Navy Yard on 21 November 1922 and remained there into January 1923.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Later that month, ''Bridgeport'' returned to Cuban waters, and served as reference vessel for torpedo-firing exercises off Manzanillo early in February. After that mission, she transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 13 February to take part in [[Fleet Problem I]] as a &quot;radio-relay vessel.&quot; That assignment occupied her through 21 February, and she entered Panama Bay on 23 February. She lay anchored there through the end of March and was among the ships reviewed by Admiral [[Robert Coontz|Robert E. Coontz]], the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], and the Honorable [[Edwin C. Denby]], the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], who were embarked in the transport {{USS|Henderson|AP-1|2}} at the time. Retransiting the canal on 26 March, ''Bridgeport'' returned to Guantanamo Bay on 30 March and then headed northward, returning to Newport on 26 April.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

From Narragansett Bay, ''Bridgeport'' returned to the Boston Navy Yard for post-deployment upkeep; while moored there, the ship conducted observances that followed the death of President [[Warren G. Harding]] on 2 August. Her officers and men assembled on the boat deck, aft, and after the ship's band had played two hymns—&quot;[[Lead, Kindly Light]],&quot; and &quot;[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]&quot;—observed a moment of silence before resuming their work.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

For the rest of the year, ''Bridgeport'' supported the fleet's destroyer forces, interspersing her time at Hampton Roads and on the Southern Drill Grounds with visits to Bridgeport (25 to 28 October) and Baltimore (10 to 11 November). She reached the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] on 18 November, and remained there through the end of 1923. Underway south on 3 January 1924, ''Bridgeport'' paused briefly at Hampton Roads the next day before pushing on toward Panama. She arrived in [[Gulf of Chiriquí|Chiriquí lagoon]], Panama on 12 January and participated in a search for a lost seaplane from {{USS|Langley|CV-1|2}}. While there, the destroyer tender also changed the starboard propeller of {{USS|Childs|DD-241|2}}.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Standing out of [[Limon Bay]], Panama on 25 January, ''Bridgeport'' visited [[Culebra, Puerto Rico]], and Kingston, Jamaica, before she served as a reference vessel for torpedo practices being conducted by destroyers off Culebra. She departed Kingston late in April and steamed via Guantanamo Bay to New York. Returning to the Southern Drill Grounds on 20 May, the tender transferred five motor sailors and two motor whaleboats to the minesweeper {{USS|Vireo|AM-52|2}}, for use as tows and umpire boats for the torpedo practices fired by {{USS|Putnam|DD-287|2}}, {{USS|Bruce|DD-329|2}}, and {{USS|Case|DD-285|2}}. ''Bridgeport'' supported the destroyers' evolutions through mid-June.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

The ship visited New York from 20 to 29 June before continuing on to Boston. She reached the Boston Navy Yard on 30 June and was decommissioned there one hour into the afternoon watch on 3 November 1924. ''Bridgeport'' remained inactive for almost two decades.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

==World War II==

''Bridgeport'' was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 2 October 1941, and she was acquired by the Bridgeport Steamship Co. on 2 February 1942 for conversion to merchant service. She proved unsuitable for service as a cargo carrier, and was returned to the government a few months later, when the [[War Shipping Administration]] (WSA) took her over on 29 June 1942. The WSA transferred the ship to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in November 1942.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=TSWWII-342 /&gt;

Surveyed and found suitable for conversion to a hospital ship, ''Bridgeport'' underwent modernization at the [[Merrill-Stevens Drydock &amp; Repair Co.]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] from September 1943 to August 1944, during which time she was renamed USAHS ''Larkspur''. Her maiden voyage as an Army hospital ship took her from Charleston, South Carolina to the British Isles. After visits to the [[River Clyde]] and to [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], she underwent repairs at [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], Wales, before sailing for home. The ship reached Charleston on 16 October 1944 with her first group of patients.&lt;ref name=TSWWII-342 /&gt;

''Larkspur'' conducted two more voyages to England before she sailed for the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] where she operated for several months, visiting [[Oran]], Algeria; [[Marseille]], France; and [[Naples]], Italy, among other ports. She then returned to Atlantic waters before being selected for conversion to an Army transport in January 1946.&lt;ref name=TSWWII-342 /&gt; Reclassified as a United States Army Transport (USAT) and resuming operation under her old name, USAT ''Bridgeport'' was reconfigured to carry [[war bride]]s and other military dependents at the [[Todd Pacific Shipyards|Todd Shipyard]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. She made several voyages between England and the United States in this capacity, operating well into 1947.&lt;ref name=TSWWII-11 /&gt;

''Bridgeport'' was delivered to the [[United States Maritime Commission]] (USMC) and entered the [[Reserve Fleet]] at [[Brunswick, Georgia]] on 16 April 1947. In November 1947, the ship was declared surplus by the WSA and stripped of all equipment and wire. ''Bridgeport'' was sold for scrapping on 13 February 1948 to the H. H. Buncher Co. of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and withdrawn from USMC custody on 1 March 1948.&lt;ref name=PMARS /&gt; She was dismantled at [[Mobile, Alabama]] later that same year.&lt;ref name=ImmShip /&gt;
