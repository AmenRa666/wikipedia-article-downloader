'''Hugh de Neville''' (died 1234; sometimes '''Hugh Neville'''&lt;ref name=Warren190/&gt;) was the [[Chief Forester (England)|Chief Forester]] under the kings [[Richard I of England|{{nowrap|Richard I}}]], [[John of England|John]], and [[Henry III of England|{{nowrap|Henry III}}]] of England. He was also the [[sheriff]] for a number of counties over his lifetime. Related to a number of other royal officials as well as a bishop, Neville was a member of Prince Richard's [[Medieval household|household]]. After Richard became king in 1189, Neville continued in his service and he accompanied him on the [[Third Crusade]]. Neville remained in the royal service following Richard's death in 1199 and the accession of King John to the throne, becoming one of the new king's favourites and often gambling with him. He was named in ''[[Magna Carta]]'' as one of John's principal advisors, considered by a medieval chronicler to be one of King John's &quot;evil councillors&quot;.&lt;ref name=List/&gt; He deserted John after the French invasion of England in 1216, but returned to pledge his loyalty to John's son {{nowrap|Henry III}} after the latter's accession to the throne later that year.  Neville's royal service continued until his death in 1234, though by then he was a less significant figure than he had been at the height of his powers.

==Early life and career==

Neville was the son of Ralph de Neville, a son of [[Alan de Neville (forester)|Alan de Neville]], who was also Chief Forester.&lt;ref name=Nevillexi/&gt; Hugh had a brother, [[Roger de Neville]], who was part of Hugh's household from 1202 to 1213, when Roger was given custody of [[Rockingham Castle]] by King John.&lt;ref name=Neville30/&gt; Another brother was William, who was given some of Hugh's lands in 1217.&lt;ref name=Neville31/&gt; Hugh, Roger, and William were related to a number of other royal officials and churchmen, most notable among them [[Geoffrey de Neville (died 1225)|Geoffrey de Neville]], who was a [[Chamberlain (office)|royal chamberlain]], and [[Ralph Neville]], who became [[Bishop of Chichester]].&lt;ref name=Neville18/&gt; Hugh de Neville employed Ralph de Neville at the start of Ralph's career, and the two appear to have remained on good terms throughout the rest of Hugh's life.&lt;ref name=Neville79&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh de Neville was a member of the household of Prince Richard, later {{nowrap|Richard I}},&lt;ref name=Neville24/&gt; and also served Richard's father, King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] at the end of Henry's reign, administering two baronies for the king.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Crook &quot;Neville, Hugh de&quot; in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; Neville accompanied Richard on the [[Third Crusade]]; he was one of the few knights who fought with the king on 5&amp;nbsp;August 1192 outside the walls of [[Jaffa]], when the king and a small force of knights and crossbowmen fought off a surprise attack by [[Saladin]]'s forces. It was famously reported that during the engagement Saladin sent Richard two remounts in the thick of battle, so that Richard would not be forced to fight on foot.&lt;ref name=Gillingham215&gt;Gillingham ''Richard I'' pp. 215–216&lt;/ref&gt; Neville's account of events was a source for the chronicler [[Ralph of Coggeshall]]'s entries on Richard's activities in the Third Crusade.&lt;ref name=Neville24&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The later medieval writer [[Matthew Paris]] recorded a colourful story about Neville encountering a lion while on crusade. This story may have been made up by Paris from the fact that Neville used a lion on his seal, since no earlier writer mentions this story.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;}}

In 1194 Neville acquired the [[wardship]] of Joan de Cornhill, daughter of [[Henry de Cornhill (sheriff)|Henry de Cornhill]], and married her four years later. Also in 1194 he was given custody of the town of [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] in Wiltshire,&lt;ref name=Neville25&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1196 was appointed as [[High Sheriff of Oxfordshire|Sheriff of Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref name=Neville18&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named in 1197 as [[High Sheriff of Essex|Sheriff of Essex]] and [[High Sheriff of Hertfordshire|Sheriff of Hertfordshire]], offices he held until some time in 1200.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Chief Forester==
[[File:Magna_Carta_(British_Library_Cotton_MS_Augustus_II.106).jpg|thumb|left|250px|A 1215 copy of ''[[Magna Carta]]'', which records de Neville as one of the royal councillors]]

Neville was appointed as Chief Forester under King Richard I&lt;ref name=Turner45&gt;Turner ''King John'' p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; in 1198.&lt;ref name=Young38&gt;Young ''Royal Forests'' p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; As the official in charge of the [[royal forest]]s, he was one of the four great officers of the state: the others were the justiciar, the chancellor, and the treasurer. The forester was responsible for enforcing the [[forest law]]&amp;nbsp;– the special law that applied to the royal forests&amp;nbsp;{{efn|Forest law was designed to protect the habitat of the deer and other hunted animals. It was unrelated to the customs and common law of England and its punishments were quite severe compared to the normal punishments of the common law.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;Saul &quot;Forest&quot; ''Companion to Medieval England'' pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;– and presided over the [[Justice in Eyre|forest justices]], who held forest [[eyre (legal term)|eyres]]. There was also a special forest [[exchequer]], or forest treasury.&lt;ref name=Turner61&gt;Turner ''King John'' p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1198 Neville presided over an [[Assize]] of the Forest that was described by the chronicler [[Roger of Howden]] as greatly oppressive.&lt;ref name=Young29&gt;Young ''Royal Forests'' pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; The revenues could be considerable; in 1198 the forest eyre brought in £1,980.&lt;ref name=Young39&gt;Young ''Royal Forests'' p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Neville stated in 1208 that over the previous six and a half years the amount raised by the various revenues of the forests had been £15,000;&lt;ref name=Turner84&gt;Turner ''King John'' p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; in 1212 it had been £4,486.&lt;ref name=Young39/&gt; Forest law was resented by the king's subjects, not just for its severity but also because of the large extent of the kingdom that it encompassed. It covered not just woodlands, but by the end of the 12th century it covered between a quarter and a third of the whole kingdom. This extent enabled the Norman and Angevin kings to use the harsh punishments of forest law to extract large sums of money for their government.&lt;ref name=Forest/&gt;

Neville continued to hold the office of Chief Forester under King John and he was often the king's gambling partner.&lt;ref name=Warren145/&gt; He was a frequent witness to John's royal [[charter]]s.&lt;ref name=Turner57&gt;Turner ''King John'' pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; Under John, Neville was named to the offices of [[High Sheriff of Hampshire|Sheriff of Hampshire]] in 1210,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and [[High Sheriff of Cumberland|Sheriff of Cumberland]], offices of which he was deprived in 1212.&lt;ref name=Neville29&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; He was also reappointed to the shrievalties of Essex and Hertfordshire in 1202, holding them until 1203.&lt;ref name=CP479&gt;Cokayne ''Complete Peerage'' '''IX''' pp. 479–480&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1210 King John fined Neville 1,000 [[mark (money)|marks]] because he had allowed [[Peter des Roches]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], to enclose some hunting grounds without royal permission; although Roches was close to the king, his action was an infringement of the royal forests. Neville's large fine was probably a warning that the king was serious about enforcing the forest law, but it was eventually rescinded.&lt;ref name=Warren145&gt;Warren ''King John'' p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In 1213 Neville was placed in charge of the seaports along the English coast from Cornwall to Hampshire,&lt;ref name=CP479/&gt; but some time in 1213 it appears that he fell from royal favour, although the circumstances are unknown. A fine of 6,000 marks was assessed on him for allowing two prisoners to escape, as well as other unrecorded offences, although the king did subsequently remit 1,000 marks of the fine. In 1215 Neville lost his office of chief forester.&lt;ref name=Young50&gt;Young ''Royal Forests'' pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; Neville was present at [[Runnymede]] for the signing of ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and was mentioned in the preamble as one of King John's councillors,&lt;ref name=Neville30&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; as well as serving as a witness to the document.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; [[Roger of Wendover]], a chronicler writing in 1211, listed Neville as one of King John's &quot;evil councillors&quot;.&lt;ref name=List&gt;Vincent &quot;King John's evil counsellors&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

==John's later reign and service under King Henry III==

John's style of ruling, and his defeats in continental Europe in 1214, had alienated many of his nobles.&lt;ref name=Huscroft150&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, a faction of the barons forced John to agree to ''Magna Carta'' to secure less capricious government from the king.&lt;ref name=Bartlett64&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; John, however, after agreeing to their demands, secured the annulment of the charter from the papacy in late 1215. The opposition magnates then invited Prince [[Louis VIII of France|Louis of France]] to take the English throne, and Louis arrived in England with an army in May 1216.&lt;ref name=Huscroft150/&gt;

Neville joined the rebel barons in 1216,&lt;ref name=Warren190&gt;Warren ''King John'' p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after Prince Louis invaded England.&lt;ref name=Carpenter12&gt;Carpenter ''Minority of Henry III'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Neville surrendered [[Marlborough Castle]], a royal castle in his custody, to Prince Louis in mid-1216. Louis had not besieged the castle, and it appears that Neville took the initiative in making overtures to the prince. When John heard of the change of sides, he confiscated all of Neville's lands held directly from the king on {{nowrap|8 July}} 1216. On 4 September 1216 the king further confiscated lands belonging to other rebels that had been granted to Neville before the surrender of Marlborough; some were re-granted to Neville's brother William. Hugh de Neville's son, Herbert, also joined the rebels.&lt;ref name=Neville31&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

After King John's death in October 1216, Neville and his son made their peace with the new king, Henry&amp;nbsp;III, John's son. Both men had their lands restored in 1217, but the offices that the elder Neville had held were not returned quickly. Custody of some royal forests was returned by 1220, but the office of Chief Forester was not returned until some time later.&lt;ref name=Neville32&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In 1218 Neville was supposed to have had the [[Rockingham Forest|forest of Rockingham]] returned to his custody, but [[William II de Forz, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|William de Forz]], the [[Count of Aumale]], refused to return it.&lt;ref name=Carpenter72&gt;Carpenter ''Minority of Henry III'' p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1220 that de Neville managed to recover his custody of Rockingham forest.&lt;ref name=Carpenter199&gt;Carpenter ''Minority of Henry III'' p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; By 1224 Neville was once more Chief Forester,&lt;ref name=Young70&gt;Young ''Royal Forests'' p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; but he never regained the power and influence that he had held under John.&lt;ref name=Neville24/&gt; When he lost the office for the second time is unclear. The historian C. R. Young states that he held the office until his death in 1234 when it passed to his son John,&lt;ref name=Neville32/&gt; but Daniel Crook, writing in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', claims that Neville lost the forester office in 1229, to be replaced by [[John of Monmouth]] and [[Brian de Lisle]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;{{efn|De Lisle was Neville's deputy as chief forester in 1225.&lt;ref name=Coss115&gt;Coss ''Origins of the English Gentry'' pp. 115-116&lt;/ref&gt;}} He also served as [[High Sheriff of Lincolnshire|Sheriff of Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref name=CP479/&gt;

==Records and lands==
Neville's household records for 1207 survive, detailing his itinerary for the year; in one eight-week period his household visited 11 different towns.&lt;ref name=Bartlett142&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1204 his wife offered the king 200 chickens for the right to sleep one night with her husband, an obligation recorded in the royal records.&lt;ref name=Warren190/&gt;{{efn|Neville's entry in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' states that the fine was 200 [[shillings]],&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; but the original Latin of the record states plainly &quot;Uxor Hugonis de Nevill' dat domino Regi CC. gallinas eo quod possit jacere una nocte cum domino suo Hugone de Nevill'&quot;,&lt;ref name=CP480fng&gt;Cokayne ''Complete Peerage'' '''IX''' p. 480 footnote g&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;CC. Gallinas&quot; in that sentence is &quot;200 Hens&quot;.&lt;ref name=Word207&gt;Latham ''Revised Medieval Latin Word-List'' p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;}} The historian Daniel Crook suggests that this shows that Joan Neville was one of the barons' wives who attracted King John's sexual attentions.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Neville inherited lands in Lincolnshire worth one half of a [[knight's fee]]. These were augmented with gifts from Richard and John, much of which were in [[Essex]]. He also acquired lands in Surrey and in Somerset, and his marriage to Joan brought him estates in Essex.&lt;ref name=Neville33&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Joan's lands also brought him into conflict with [[Falkes de Breauté]], the husband of Joan's younger sister and co-heiress, and the two brothers-in-law were involved in lawsuits over their wives' lands for more than five years.&lt;ref name=Neville47&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Joan and her sister were also co-heiresses to the barony of Courcy, in right of their mother Alice de Courcy.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Neville's first wife, Joan de Cornhill, died after December 1224. Some time before April 1230 he married secondly Beatrice, the widow of Ralph de Fay and one of the five daughters of [[Stephen of Thornham|Stephen of Turnham]]. Joan and Neville had at least three sons&amp;nbsp;– John, Henry,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and Herbert.&lt;ref name=Neville31/&gt; Neville also had a daughter named Joan.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Neville died in 1234,&lt;ref name=Nevillexi&gt;Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; although his death was incorrectly recorded by [[Matthew Paris]] as occurring in 1222.{{efn|This error led some earlier historians to postulate two different Hugh de Nevilles&amp;nbsp;– the forester and a son also named Hugh. This disproved theory then had the elder Hugh dying in 1222 and the invented son dying in 1234.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;}} Neville was buried at [[Waltham Abbey (abbey)|Waltham Abbey]], of which he had been a patron.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Besides Waltham, he also made gifts to [[Christ Church Priory]] in Canterbury, [[Bullington Priory]] in Lincolnshire, and [[St James Church, Clerkenwell#Nunnery of St Mary: c. 1100 - 1539|St Mary's Nunnery, Clerkenwell]].&lt;ref name=CP480&gt;Cokayne ''Complete Peerage'' '''IX''' p. 480 footnote j&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Sidney Painter]] said of Neville's career during John's reign that &quot;a strong argument could be advanced for the thesis that the royal official who wielded the most actual power during John's reign was the chief forester, Hugh de Neville&quot;.&lt;ref name=QNeville24&gt;Quoted in Young ''Making of the Neville Family'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian, J. R. Maddicott, states that Neville was head of &quot;one of the most detested branches of royal administration&quot;.&lt;ref name=Maddicott316&gt;Maddicott &quot;Oath of Marlborough&quot; ''English Historical Review'' p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;
