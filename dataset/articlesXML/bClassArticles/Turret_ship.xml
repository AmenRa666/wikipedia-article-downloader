'''Turret ships''' were a 19th-century type of [[warship]], the earliest to have their guns mounted in a revolving [[gun turret]], instead of a [[broadside]] arrangement.

==Background==
[[File:HMS Prince Albert (1864).jpg|200px|thumb|[[HMS Prince Albert (1864)|HMS ''Prince Albert'']], a pioneering turret ship, built by naval engineer [[Cowper Phipps Coles]].]]
Before the development of large-calibre, long-range guns in the mid-19th century, the classic [[battleship]] design used rows of port-mounted guns on each side of the ship, often mounted in [[casemate]]s. Firepower was provided by a large number of guns which could only be aimed in a limited arc from one side of the ship. Due to instability, fewer larger and heavier guns can be carried on a ship. Also, the casemates often sat near the waterline, which made them vulnerable to flooding and restricted their use to calm seas.

[[Gun turret|Turrets]] were [[weapon mount]]s designed to protect the crew and mechanism of the  [[artillery|artillery piece]] and with the capability of being aimed and fired in many directions as a rotating weapon platform. This platform can be mounted on a [[fortification|fortified]] [[building]] or [[structure]] such as an anti-naval [[land battery]], or on a [[combat vehicle]], a [[naval ship]], or a [[military aviation|military aircraft]].

==Origins==
Designs for a rotating gun turret date back to the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-KbN-xWTj7kC&amp;pg=PT36&amp;dq=Gillespie+Turret+1805&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSue2D3_rKAhWKuhQKHUgzBw4Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Gillespie%20Turret%201805&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Crimean War]], Captain [[Cowper Phipps Coles]] constructed a [[raft]] with guns protected by a 'cupola' and used the raft, named the [[Siege of Taganrog|''Lady Nancy'']], to shell the Russian town of [[Taganrog]] in the [[Black Sea]]. The ''Lady Nancy'' &quot;proved a great success&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;captain1p21&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Preston, Antony|title=The World's Worst Warships|publisher=London: Conway Maritime Press|year=2002|ISBN=0-85177-754-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Coles patented his rotating turret after the war. Following Coles' patenting, the British [[Admiralty]] ordered a [[prototype]] of Coles' design in 1859, which was installed in the floating battery vessel, [[HMS Trusty (1855)|HMS ''Trusty'']], for trials in 1861, becoming the first warship to be fitted with a revolving gun turret. Coles' design aim was to create a ship with the greatest possible all round arc of fire, as low in the water as possible to minimise the target.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnaby&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Some ship disasters and their causes |author=K. C. Barnaby |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |year=1968|pages=20–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS captainWilliam Frederick Mitchell.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[HMS Captain (1869)|HMS ''Captain'']] was one of the first ocean-going turret ships.]]

The [[Admiralty]] accepted the principle of the gun turret as a useful innovation, and incorporated it into other new designs. Coles submitted a design for a ship having ten domed turrets each housing two large guns. The design was rejected as impractical, although the Admiralty remained interested in turret ships and instructed its own designers to create better designs.

Coles enlisted the support of [[Prince Albert]], who wrote to the first Lord of the Admiralty, the Duke of Somerset, supporting the construction of a turret ship. In January 1862, the Admiralty agreed to construct a ship, the [[HMS Prince Albert (1864)|HMS ''Prince Albert'']], which had four turrets and a low freeboard, intended only for coastal defence. Coles  was allowed to design the turrets, but the ship was the responsibility of the chief Constructor [[Isaac Watts (naval architect)|Isaac Watts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnaby&quot;/&gt;

==Expansion==
Another of Coles' designs, {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1857|6}}, was completed in August 1864. Its existing broadside guns were replaced with four turrets on a flat deck and the ship was fitted with {{convert|5.5|in|mm}} of armour in a belt around the waterline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnaby&quot;/&gt; Early ships like ''Monitor'' and the ''Royal Sovereign'' had little sea-keeping qualities being limited to coastal waters. Coles, in collaboration with Sir [[Edward James Reed]], went on to design and build [[HMS Monarch (1868)|HMS ''Monarch'']], the first seagoing warship to carry her guns in turrets. Laid down in 1866 and completed in June 1869, it carried two turrets, although the inclusion of a forecastle and poop prevented the guns firing fore and aft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnaby&quot;/&gt;

[[File:USS Monitor plans.jpg|thumb|right|274px|Inboard plans of [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']].]]
The gun turret was independently invented by the Swedish inventor [[John Ericsson]] in America, although his design was technologically inferior to Coles'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9-0ZuKsMvIC|title=Battleships: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|author=Stanley Sandler|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ericsson designed the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] in 1861. Its most prominent feature was a large cylindrical gun turret mounted [[amidships]] above the low-freeboard upper [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], also called the &quot;raft&quot;. This extended well past the sides of the lower, more traditionally shaped hull. A small armoured [[pilot house]] was fitted on the upper deck towards the bow, however, its position prevented ''Monitor'' from firing her guns straight forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Spencer |year=2006 |title=Blue &amp; gray navies: the Civil War afloat |ref=Tucker06 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Maryland |isbn=1-59114-882-0|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{efn|Ericsson later admitted that this was a serious flaw in the ship's design and that the pilot house should have been placed atop the turret.}} One of Ericsson's prime goals in designing the ship was to present the smallest possible target to enemy gunfire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Stephen C.|year=1990|title=The Design and Construction of the USS Monitor|ref=Thompson90|journal=Warship International |publisher=International Naval Research Organization |location=Toledo, Ohio| volume=XXVII|issue=3 |issn=0043-0374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turret's rounded shape helped to deflect cannon shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mindell |first=David A. |year=2000 |ref=Mindell |title=War, Technology, and Experience Aboard the USS Monitor |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-6250-2|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCordock |first=Robert Stanley |title=The Yankee Cheese Box |ref=McCordock |publisher=Dorrance |year=1938 |oclc=|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of [[donkey engine]]s rotated the turret through a set of gears; a full rotation was made in 22.5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt; Fine control of the turret proved to be difficult as the engine would have to be placed in reverse if the turret overshot its mark or another full rotation could be made. Including the guns, the turret weighed approximately {{convert|160|LT|t|0}}; the entire weight rested on an iron spindle that had to be jacked up using a wedge before the turret could rotate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt;

[[File:USSMonitor1862.3.ws.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Turret of [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']].]]
The spindle was {{convert|9|in|cm|0}} in diameter, which gave it ten times the strength needed in preventing the turret from sliding sideways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=James Phinney, 3rd |authorlink=James Phinney Baxter III |title=The Introduction of the Ironclad Warship  |edition=reprint of the 1933 publication |year=1968 |publisher=Archon Books |location=Hamden, Connecticut,  |oclc=695838727 &lt;!-- |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CQzAAAAMAAJ no preview--&gt; |ref=Baxter|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; When not in use, the turret rested on a brass ring on the deck that was intended to form a watertight seal. In service, however, this proved to leak heavily, despite [[caulking]] by the crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt;  The gap between the turret and the deck proved to be a problem as debris and shell fragments entered the gap and jammed the turrets of several {{sclass-|Passaic|monitor|3|warship}}s, which used the same turret design, during the [[First Battle of Charleston Harbor]] in April 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Canney| first=Donald L. |title=The Old Steam Navy |ref=Canney |publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland &lt;!-- |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzAhAQAAIAAJ no preview--&gt; |year=1993 |volume=2: The Ironclads, 1842–1885 |isbn=0-87021-586-8|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct hits at the turret with heavy shot also had the potential to bend the spindle, which could also jam the turret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Our Iron-clad Ships: Their Qualities, Performances, and Cost.

The turret was intended to mount a pair of {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} [[smoothbore]] [[Dahlgren gun]]s, but they were not ready in time and {{convert|11|in|adj=on}} guns were substituted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt; Each gun weighed approximately {{convert|16000|lb}}.

==Culmination==
[[File:HMS Thunderer (1872).jpg|200px|thumb|[[HMS Thunderer (1872)|HMS ''Thunderer'']] incorporated hydraulic mechanisms into the turret, and marked the transition toward the modern [[battleship]].]]
[[HMS Devastation (1871)|HMS ''Devastation'']] of 1871 and [[HMS Thunderer (1872)|HMS ''Thunderer'']] of 1872 represented the culmination of this pioneering work. These [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] turret ships were designed by [[Edward James Reed]], 
They were also the world's first mastless battleships, built with a central superstructure layout, and became the prototype for all subsequent warships, leading directly to the modern [[battleship]].
