'''United States Forces Korea''' ('''USFK''') is a sub-unified command of [[United States Pacific Command]] (USPACOM). USFK is the joint headquarters through which U.S. combat forces would be sent to the South Korea/US (ROK/U.S.) Combined Forces Command’s (CFC) fighting components — the combined ground, air, naval, marine and special operations forces component commands. Major USFK elements include [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth U.S. Army]] (EUSA), U.S. Air Forces Korea ([[Seventh Air Force]]), U.S. Naval Forces Korea (CNFK), U.S. Marine Forces Korea (MARFORK) and [[Special Operations Command Korea]] (SOCKOR). It was established on 1 July 1957.

Its mission is to support the United Nations Command and Combined Forces Command by coordinating and planning among U.S. component commands, and exercise operational control of U.S. forces as directed by [[United States Pacific Command]].

USFK has Title 10 authority, which means that USFK is responsible for organizing, training and equipping U.S. forces on the Korean Peninsula so that forces are agile, adaptable and ready.

With 28,500 American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines in South Korea, U.S. forces in South Korea are a forward presence in the region and a key manifestation of the U.S. government's rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific. The USFK mission also includes planning [[non-combatant evacuation operation]]s to ensure that if the need arises, U.S. and other previously agreed-upon countries' citizens are removed from harm's way. To this end, USFK conducts routine exercises to ensure that this process is effective, efficient and orderly.

==Components==
* [[Eighth United States Army]]; Headquarters: [[Yongsan Garrison]], Korea; authorized about 20,000 Soldiers
* [[Seventh Air Force]]; Headquarters: [[Osan Air Base]], Korea; authorized about 8,000 Airmen 
* [[Commander Naval Forces Korea]] (CNFK); Headquarters: Yongsan Garrison, Korea; authorized about 300 Sailors 
* Marine Forces Korea (MARFORK); Headquarters: Yongsan Garrison, Korea; authorized about 100 Marines 
* [[Special Operations Command Korea]] (SOCKOR):  Headquarters:  [[Camp Kim]], Yongsan, Korea; authorized about 100 members

==United Nations Command and Combined Forces Command==
While USFK is a separate organization from United Nations Command (UNC) and CFC, its mission is to support both UNC and CFC by coordinating and planning among US component commands and providing US supporting forces to the CFC. As such, USFK continues to support the ROK-US Mutual Defense Treaty.

In response to the North Korean attack against South Korea on 25 June 1950, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) established the UNC as a unified command under the US in UNSC Resolution 84 on 7 July 1950. The UNC mission was to assist South Korea to repel the attack and restore international peace and security in Korea. Throughout the war, 53 nations provided support to the UNC; 16 nations provided combat forces and five sent medical and hospital units. After three years of hostilities, the commanders of both sides signed the Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953.

Hostilities today are also deterred by this bi-national defense team that evolved from the multi-national UNC. Established on 7 November 1978, the [[ROK-US Combined Forces Command]] (CFC) is the warfighting headquarters. Its role is to deter, or defeat if necessary, outside aggression against the ROK.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
The following is a partial '''list of border incidents involving North Korea''' since the [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] of 27 July 1953, ended large scale military action of the [[Korean War]].  Most of these incidents took place near either the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] or the [[Northern Limit Line]]. This list includes engagements on land, air, and sea, but does not include alleged incursions and terrorist incidents that occurred away from the border.

Many of the incidents occurring at sea are due to border disputes.  The North claims jurisdiction over a large area south of the disputed western maritime border, the Northern Limit Line in the [[Yellow Sea|waters west of the Korean Peninsula]]. This is a prime fishing area, particularly for crabs, and clashes commonly occur. In addition, the North claims its territorial waters extend for {{convert|50|nmi|km|-1}} from the coast, rather than the {{convert|12|nmi|km|0}} recognized by other countries.  According to the 5 January 2011 ''[[Korea Herald]]'', since July 1953 North Korea has violated the armistice 221 times, including 26 military attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20110105000563|title=N.K. Commits 221 Provocations Since 1953|publisher=''[[Korea Herald]]''|date=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
*16 February 1958: North Korean agents hijack a South Korean airliner to Pyongyang en route from Pusan to Seoul; 1 American pilot, 1 American passenger, 2 West German passengers, and 24 other passengers were released in early March, but 8 other passengers remained in the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dick K.

===1960s===
[[File:CharlesJenkinsJI1.jpg|thumb|Sergeant [[Charles Robert Jenkins|Charles Jenkins]] in 2007.]]
* May 1962: Private [[Larry Abshier|Larry Allen Abshier]] abandoned his post in South Korea in May 1962 when he crept away from his base and crossed the DMZ into North Korea. Larry Abshier was the first to defect. Also in May 1962, [[Corporal]] [[Jerry Parrish]] crossed the DMZ into North Korea. His reasons for defecting, according to Jenkins' autobiography ''The Reluctant Communist'', were &quot;personal, and [Parrish] didn't elaborate about them much except to say that if he ever went home, his father-in-law would kill him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Reluctant Communist''. [[Charles Robert Jenkins]] (University of California Press) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aug 1962: [[James Joseph Dresnok]] was a [[Private First Class]] with a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] unit along the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. Soon after his arrival, he found himself facing a [[court martial]] for forging signatures on paperwork that gave him permission to leave base and which, ultimately, led to him being [[AWOL]] (Absent Without Official Leave).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/movies/19cros.html |last=Russell |first=Mark |title=An American in North Korea, Pledging Allegiance to the Great Leader |publisher=New York Times |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unwilling to face punishment, on 15 August 1962, while his fellow soldiers were eating lunch, he ran across a [[minefield]] in broad daylight into North Korean territory, where he was quickly apprehended by North Korean soldiers. Dresnok was taken by train to [[Pyongyang]], the North Korean capital, and interrogated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert G. |last=Anderson |author2=Casey Morgan  |title=Joe Dresnok: An American In North Korea |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-dresnok-an-american-in-north-korea/ |work=60 Minutes |publisher=CBS News |date=28 January 2007 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Jan 1965: [[Charles Robert Jenkins|Charles Jenkins]], the most notable case, defected to North Korea. In South Korea, Jenkins was assigned to night patrols. As a result of fears that he would be transferred to combat duty in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], he grew depressed and anxious, and started drinking alcohol. On the night of 4 January 1965, after reportedly drinking ten beers, he set off on his nightly patrol of the Demilitarized Zone. In the early morning, he told his patrol that he was going to investigate a noise.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/deserter-recalls-n-korean-hell/ | work=CBS News | title=Deserter Recalls N. Korean Hell}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently crossed into North Korea and surrendered to forces there, in hopes of being sent to Russia and then, through prisoner exchange, eventually returned to America. Shortly thereafter, North Korean [[propaganda]] declared that a U.S. sergeant had defected, and broadcast statements allegedly made by the [[defector]], reportedly in stilted English. The U.S. Army claimed Jenkins wrote four letters stating his intention to defect (an allegation Jenkins denies); however, the original letters are reportedly lost. His relatives maintained throughout his absence that he was abducted.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews2005&quot;/&gt;
*27 April 1965: Two North Korean [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]]s attack a United States [[EC-121 Warning Star]] reconnaissance plane in the [[Sea of Japan|waters east of the Korean Peninsula]], {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the North Korean shore. The aircraft was damaged, but managed to land at [[Yokota Air Base]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.skynet.be/Emmanuel.Gustin/faq/shotdowns.html |title=Cold War Shootdowns |accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL30004.pdf |title=North Korean Provocative Actions, 1950 - 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-09 |date=2007-04-20 |format=PDF |publisher=[[United States Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*17 January 1968: In an incident known as the [[Blue House Raid]], a 31-man detachment from the [[Korean People's Army]] secretly crosses the DMZ on a mission to kill South Korean [[President of South Korea|President]] [[Park Chung-hee]] on 21 January, nearly succeeding. The incursion was discovered after South Korean civilians confronted the North Koreans and informed the authorities. After entering [[Seoul]] disguised as [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean soldiers]], the North Koreans attempt to enter the [[Cheong Wa Dae|Blue House]] (the official residence of the President of South Korea). The North Koreans are confronted by [[Law enforcement in South Korea|South Korean police]] and a firefight ensued. The North Koreans fled Seoul and individually attempted to cross the DMZ back to North Korea. Of the original group of 31 North Koreans, 28 were killed, one was captured, and two are unaccounted for. Additionally, 68 South Koreans were killed and 66 were wounded, the majority of whom were soldiers and police officers. Three American soldiers were also killed and three were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniel |first=Bolger |title=Scenes from an Unfinished War: Low-Intensity Conflict in Korea, 1966-1968 |url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/ScenesFromanUnfinishedWar.pdf |accessdate=2007-12-10 |publisher=[[Command and General Staff College]] |chapter=3: A Continuous Nightmare |chapterurl=http://cgsc.leavenworth.army.mil/carl/download/csipubs/scenes/scen_c3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*23 January 1968:  The [[United States Navy|United States Naval]] ship the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'']] is boarded and captured, along with its crew, by North Korean forces in the [[Sea of Japan|waters east of the Korean Peninsula]]. The entire crew of 83 is captured, with the exception of one sailor killed in the initial attack on the vessel, and the vessel was taken to a North Korean port. All the captives were released on 23 December of the same year via the [[Bridge of No Return]] at the DMZ. The USS ''Pueblo'' is still in North Korean possession and is docked in [[Pyongyang]] and is on display as a [[museum ship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/p13/pueblo-iii.htm |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101208130037/http%3A//www%2Ehistory%2Enavy%2Emil/danfs/p13/pueblo%2Diii%2Ehtm |archivedate= 8 December 2010 |title=''Pueblo'' |work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships |accessdate=2007-12-10 |publisher=[[United States Navy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*30 October 1968: From 30 October – 2 November 120 to 130 North Korean commandos land on the northeast shore of South Korea, allegedly to establish a base in order to wage a guerrilla war against the South Korean government. A total of 110 to 113 were killed, seven were captured, and 13 escaped. Around 20 South Korean civilians, law enforcement officers, and soldiers were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreascope.org/tt/eNorthKoreaToday/entry/filtration-of-North-Korean-Commando-Troops-into-Ulchin-Samchok-Area |title=filtration of North Korean Commando Troops into Ulchin-Samchok Area |accessdate=2007-12-12 |date=2006-08-31 |publisher=Koreascope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gwangju Uprising===
The 1980s marked a surge in [[Anti-American sentiment in Korea|anti-Americanism in Korea]], widely traced to [[Gwangju Uprising|the events of May 1980]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eroseffect.com&quot;&gt;http://www.eroseffect.com/articles/neoliberalismgwangju.htm#_ednref71 Neoliberalism and the Gwangju Uprising&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Gwangju convinced a new generation of young [Koreans] that the democratic movement had developed not with the support of Washington, as an older generation of more conservative Koreans thought, but in the face of daily American support for any dictator who could quell the democratic aspirations of the Korean people. The result was an anti-American movement in the 1980s that threatened to bring down the whole structure of American support for the ROK. American cultural centers were burned to the ground (more than once in Gwangju); students [[immolated themselves]] in protest of [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s support for [[Chun Doo-hwan|Chun]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Cumings in Lee Jai-Eui, Gwangju Diary. University of California, 1999. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Fundamental to this movement was a perception of U.S. complicity in Chun's rise to power, and, more particularly, in the [[Gwangju massacre]] itself. These matters remain controversial. It is clear, for example, that the U.S. authorized the Korean Army's 20th Division to re-take Gwangju – as acknowledged in a 1982 letter to the ''[[New York Times]]'' by then-Ambassador Gleysteen. &lt;blockquote&gt;[General [[John A. Wickham, Jr.|Wickham]]], with my concurrence, permitted transfer of well-trained troops of the twentieth R.O.K.A. Division from martial-law duty in Seoul to Gwangju because law and order had to be restored in a situation that had run amok following the outrageous behavior of the Korean Special Forces, which had never been under General Wickham's command.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in The Gwangju Uprising. Ed. Henry Scott-Stokes and Lee Jai-Eui, East Gate Publishing, 2000. p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; However, as Gwangju Uprising editors Scott-Stokes and Lee note, whether the expulsion of government troops left the situation lawless or &quot;amok&quot; is very much open to dispute.

===21st century===
In 2002, anti-American sentiment in South Korea spiked after two U.S. soldiers in an [[M60 AVLB]] [[armoured vehicle-launched bridge]] accidentally hit and killed two South Korean teenage girls in the [[Yangju highway incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2552875.stm |title=Anti-US protests grow in Seoul |date=8 December 2002 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An expansion of [[Camp Humphreys]] later in the decade saw protests, drawing thousands of South Korean citizens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/turmoil-barbed-wire-surround-rice-fields-1.48885 |title=Turmoil, barbed wire surround rice fields |author=Franklin Fisher |date=13 May 2006 |work=Stars and Stripes |accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in occasional violent clashes and arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2603997 |title=Ten injured in protest near U.S. military base |date=8 August 2005 |work=Joongang Daily |accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a series of large protests against the U.S. and Republic of Korea governments' plan to expand Camp Humphreys and make it the main base for most U.S. troops in South Korea, residents of Daechuri and other small villages near Pyeongtaek agreed to a government settlement to leave their homes in 2006 and allow the base's expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/ceremonies-honor-residents-driven-from-lands-slated-for-humphreys-expansion-1.62541 |title=Ceremonies honor residents driven from lands slated for Humphreys expansion |publisher=Stars and Stripes |accessdate=9 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/s-koreans-rally-at-camp-humphreys-fence-to-protest-u-s-presence-1.36754 |title=S.

==Exercises==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2013}}
Each year the ROK, the US and a selection of Sending States from the United Nations Command participate in multiple defense-oriented, combined and joint training events designed to defend the Republic of Korea, protect the region, and maintain and increase stability on the Korean peninsula.

[[Ulchi-Freedom Guardian]], [[Key Resolve]], and [[Foal Eagle]], in addition to multiple Rehearsal of Concept (ROC) Drills, are the three theater level exercises.

*[[Ulchi-Freedom Guardian]] (UFG) is an annual simulation driven, command transformation-oriented Command Post Exercise (CPX). Elements of the ROK and US governments participate, as well as ROK and US forces from on and off the Korean peninsula. UFG integrates the annual ROK government exercise &quot;Ulchi&quot;, which focuses on procedures for transitioning to war, government support. Ulchi also emphasizes ROK procedures for coordination between government and military organizations from the national to local level. UFG typically incorporates the following components: a Crisis Management Exercise focused on strategic and operational decisions needed to defuse a crisis, or posture the command for successful execution of the appropriate OPLAN if the enemy actions dictate; a Senior Leader Seminar (SLS) designed to foster senior-level discussion on a variety of topics related to crisis management and war-fighting; and a two-week Computer Assisted Exercise that exercises the transition to war, defense, and counteroffensive phases of the war-fight. The exercise culminates in detailed senior leader level After-Action Reviews (AARs).
*[[Key Resolve]] (KR) is over the course of a two-week-long CFC and ROK crisis management and war-fighting exercise. It provides invaluable opportunities to evaluate, train, and improves combined and joint coordination, procedures, plans and systems necessary for the conduct of contingency operations by ROK and US forces. It is a simulation driven Command Post exercise that exercises the defense of the ROK and the ability of the US to bring forces into the Theater of Operations to participate in that defense. The exercise culminates in detailed senior leader level AARs.
*[[Foal Eagle]] (FE) is a series of component-sponsored joint and combined Field Training Exercises (FTX) that support training of OPLAN related tasks via participation of selected off-peninsula units. FE demonstrates US power projection and rapid deployment capabilities and is conducted concurrently, but not linked to, the KR CPX. Tactical units are the primary FE FTX training audience exercising all aspects of CFC's mission; rear area security, support operations, RSOI, special operations, ground maneuver, expeditionary operations, air combat operations, and maritime operations.

==Shoulder sleeve insignia==
===Description===
A shield-shaped embroidered device 3 1/8 inches (7.94&amp;nbsp;cm) in height and 2 1/2 inches (6.35&amp;nbsp;cm) in width overall blazoned: azure, in chief four mullets bendwise argent, all above a stylized [[American bald eagle]], issuant from sinister base volant to dexter chief; the eagle’s body gules surmounted by two bendlets, wider at base, of the second throughout; head of the second, eyed of the field, leg and talons of the second grasping a laurel branch and seven arrows or. The entire shield shape is edged with a 1/16 inch(.16&amp;nbsp;cm) white border.  Attached above the device is a designation band in scarlet inscribed &quot;USFK&quot; in white letters.  The entire device is edged with a 1/8 inch (.32&amp;nbsp;cm) blue border.

===Symbolism===
The shield shape reflects the United States Forces Korea’s steadfast commitment to defend the sovereignty of South Korea. The abbreviation &quot;USFK&quot; stands for United States Forces Korea which activated on 1 July 1957.  The four stars symbolize the service and contributions of the United States Army, United States Navy, United States Air Force, and the United States Marine Corps.  The stylized American bald eagle represents cohesion and unity among the services.  The laurel sprigs and arrows depict the mission of the United States Forces Korea to defeat aggression if necessary.  Red, white, and blue are the colors of the flag of the United States of America.  Red symbolizes hard work and honor, white represents innocence and purity, and blue refers to justice and perseverance.  Yellow signifies wisdom and intuition.

===Background===
The shoulder sleeve insignia was approved on 18 June 2012.  (TIOH Dwg. No. A-1-1077).&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Heraldry, http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyDUISSICOA/ArmyHeraldryUnit.aspx?u=8572&lt;/ref&gt;
