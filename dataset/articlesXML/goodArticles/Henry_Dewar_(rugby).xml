'''Henry &quot;Norkey&quot; Dewar''' (13{{nbsp}}October 1883{{snd}}9{{nbsp}}August 1915) was a New Zealand [[rugby union]] [[Rugby union positions#Forwards|forward]], who played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]], and represented [[Taranaki Rugby Football Union|Taranaki]] and [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]] provinces.

Playing for the Melrose Club in [[Wellington]], he was selected in 1908 for the provincial team that played and defeated the [[1908 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|Anglo-Welsh]] team on tour in New Zealand. After moving to [[Taranaki]] in 1910, he was soon selected to represent the province. Coming close to winning the [[Ranfurly Shield]] in 1912, a subsequent challenge the following year was successful against the longtime holders [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]]. He earned selection to the North Island team for the annual Inter-Island match and thereafter was picked to play for the All Blacks, first to play Australia and then for the tour of North America, in which he played 14 of the 16 games, including the 51–3 defeat of the All America team.

Soon after the British Empire declared war on Germany on 5{{nbsp}}August 1914, Dewar signed up to the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]], and took part in the expedition to [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupy German Samoa]], departing the day after he played for Taranaki defending a challenge from [[Wairarapa Rugby Football Union|Wairarapa]]. On his return, he volunteered again for active service and enlisted in the [[Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment|Wellington Mounted Rifles]], joining the machine gun section. After promotion to [[sergeant]], he departed in October for Egypt. There, he captained his regiment's rugby team in matches against other New Zealand and Australian regiments. He landed at [[ANZAC Cove|Anzac Cove]] on 8{{nbsp}}August 1915 and participated in the action to capture [[Battle of Chunuk Bair|Chunuk Bair]] in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. The following day he was killed in action.

== Early life ==
Henry Dewar, born 13 October 1883 in [[Foxton, New Zealand]],&lt;ref name=NAM&gt;{{cite web|title=A Soldier and a Rugby Player|url=http://www.armymuseum.co.nz/newsletter/museum-news-october-2011.html|website=National Army Museum|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Some sources say Dewar was born in Wellington.{{sfn|McCarthy|1968|p=62}}&lt;ref name=AllBlacks /&gt;}} was the son of Alexander and Lydia Dewar.{{sfn|McCrery|2014|p=132}} He spent most of his early years in [[Wellington]] until moving to Taranaki in 1910 where he worked as an [[iron moulder]] for B. Harkness of Stratford.{{sfn|McCrery|2014|p=132}}&lt;ref name=NAM /&gt;

== Rugby career ==
[[File:1913 All Blacks team that toured California.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The New Zealand team before their departure to North America in 1913. Dewar is standing in the second from back row, second from the right.|alt=A team of men wearing blazers and hats posing for a formal photo.]]
Dewar first played for the Melrose Club in Wellington and was selected for [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]] province in 1907.&lt;ref name=AllBlacks&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/profile.asp?ABID=221 | title = Norkey Dewar | last = Knight | first = Lindsay | publisher = allblacks.com | accessdate = 14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, he was a member of the Wellington team that defeated the touring [[1908 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|Anglo-Welsh]] 19–13 on 27{{nbsp}}May. The visitors played much of the game with fourteen players, only six forwards, after an injury in the first half: the captains, before the game, had agreed that there would be no substitutions for injury. Dewar and Rush, in particular, as well as Harding and Cracroft Wilson, bore the &quot;heat and burden of a truly Homeric struggle.&quot;{{sfn|Swan|1952|p=54}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain v Wellington|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS19080527.2.13&amp;srpos=21|accessdate=15 July 2015|work=Auckland Start|date=27 May 1908|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Wellington Match|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=TS19080528.2.34&amp;srpos=22|accessdate=15 July 2015|work=The Star|issue=9247|date=28 May 1908|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comments on the Game|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=DOM19080528.2.17&amp;srpos=24|accessdate=15 July 2015|work=The Dominion|date=28 May 1908|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, on 15{{nbsp}}August, he took part in a [[Ranfurly Shield]] challenge, which resulted in a heavy 24–3 defeat for Wellington at the hands of [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]].{{sfn|McCrery|2014|p=132}} The challengers, away to Auckland, were the underdogs but it was expected to be a close game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rugby Game|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19080815.2.67.1&amp;srpos=73|accessdate=15 July 2015|work=New Zealand Herald|date=15 August 1908|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at half-time Auckland were just leading by a [[conversion (rugby)|conversion]], 5–3. In the second half, Auckland's forwards imposed themselves on Wellington, who struggled to maintain the pace and were unable to respond to Auckland's scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Ranfurly Shield|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS19080817.2.56&amp;srpos=74|accessdate=15 July 2015|work=Auckland Star|date=17 August 1908|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewar moved to [[Taranaki]] in 1910, where he played his club rugby for Stratford; he captained the team in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stratford News|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=TDN19130513.2.9&amp;srpos=167|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Taranaki Daily News|date=13 May 1913|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first selected for [[Taranaki Rugby Football Union|Taranaki]] that year and continued to represent the club until the outbreak of the First World War.&lt;ref name=AllBlacks /&gt; In 1912, Taranaki, with Dewar in the team, came close to winning the Ranfurly Shield from Auckland, losing 6–5. In front of a 12,000-spectator home crowd, Auckland dominated in the first half, scoring six points through a [[try]] and a penalty kick. The second half saw Taranaki's forwards take control for long periods, resulting in a converted try, but despite ongoing attacks, the visitors were unable to add to their score and lost by just one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Struggle for the Shield|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=PBH19120819.2.73.1&amp;srpos=132|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Poverty Bay Herald|date=19 August 1912|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1913 Season ===
1913 saw Dewar's best season. His provincial form saw him selected for the North Island in the annual Inter-Island match, having been nominated for inclusion the previous year but not selected.&lt;ref name=II13&gt;{{cite news|title=Inter-Island Match|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19130728.2.9.1&amp;srpos=197|accessdate=15 July 2015|work=New Zealand Herald|date=28 July 1913|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Zealand Rugby Union|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=HNS19120627.2.47.1&amp;srpos=106|accessdate=15 July 2015|work=Hawera &amp; Normanby Star|date=27 June 1912|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, the North was beaten 25–0.&lt;ref name=II13 /&gt; He was then part of the Taranaki team that ended Auckland's long tenure of the Ranfurly Shield, in a game described as &quot;the finest match... and the most exciting... ever witnessed in the history of the Ranfurly Shield&quot;. Taranaki controlled the first half, with the forwards stronger than their opponents in every aspect, scoring the first points. The visitors' lead of 0–3, however, changed to a half-time score of 5–3 in Auckland's favour after an injury temporarily reduced the opposition to fourteen men. Soon after the break, Taranaki took the lead through a try, and then a second — scored by Dewar, who was continuously &quot;in the thick of it&quot; — took them four points ahead, 5–9. The home side responded with two tries of their own to take back a two-point lead. Towards the end of the game, Taranaki scored one more try, which was converted and gave them a 14–11 victory to win the Shield for the first time: Auckland was the first team to be awarded the Shield in 1902 and, after Wellington won it in 1904, regained it and held on to it continuously from 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Great Game|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=PBH19130820.2.73&amp;srpos=235|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Poverty Bay Herald|date=20 August 1913|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gone at last|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS19130818.2.82.1&amp;srpos=226|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Auckland Star|date=18 August 1913|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also played in the Taranaki side that was only narrowly beaten by the touring Australians in 1913. His form in these games earned him a place with the All Blacks. On 6{{nbsp}}September 1913, he played in the 30–5 first test win over Australia at Athletic Park: [[Albert Downing]] and George Sellars played alongside him and were also later killed in action in the First World War.{{sfn|McCrery|2014|p=132}} Dewar was then selected, along with four other Taranaki players,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taranaki Rugby Union|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=HNS19140325.2.55&amp;srpos=266|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Hawera &amp; Normanby Star|date=25 March 1914|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[1913 New Zealand rugby union tour of North America|tour of North America]], playing in 14 of the 16 games, including the 51–3 victory over the All America team for his second test cap.{{sfn|McCrery|2014|p=132}} He received particular mention in the test match for a cunning [[dummy (football)|dummy]] pass to Downing on his right, drawing the defence and passing to five-eighths McKenzie on his left to run in for a try.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The All America Match|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS19131219.2.84&amp;srpos=265|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Auckland Star|date=19 December 1913|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored just one try.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rugby Football|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=HNS19131025.2.76.3&amp;srpos=262|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Hawera &amp; Normanby Star|date=25 October 1913|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was little interest in the American press about the tour. A single short paragraph in the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' reports on the 51–3 defeat of the USA team on 15{{nbsp}}November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therugbyhistorysociety.co.uk/mitchellmm.html|title=Mowatt Mitchell From The Rugby History Society|work=therugbyhistorysociety.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Dewar participated in Taranaki's defence of the Shield against Wellington on 24{{nbsp}}June, winning 14–10;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Ranfurly Shield Wellington v Taranaki|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS19140625.2.67&amp;srpos=283|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Auckland Star|date=25 June 1914|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wanganui Rugby Football Union|Wanganui]], on 27{{nbsp}}June, winning 17–3;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Ranfurly Shield|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=ODT19140629.2.3&amp;srpos=143|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Otago Daily Times|issue=16112|date=29 June 1914|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manawatu Rugby Union|Manawatu]], on 23{{nbsp}}July, winning 11–3, with Dewar &quot;prominent&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taranaki defeat Manawatu|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=TDN19140724.2.10&amp;srpos=10|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Taranaki Daily News|date=24 July 1914|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horowhenua-Kapiti Rugby Football Union|Horowhenua]];&lt;ref name=AllBlacks /&gt; and [[Wairarapa Rugby Football Union|Wairarapa]], on 14{{nbsp}}August, winning 22–3.&lt;ref name=Wairarapa&gt;{{cite news|title=Taranaki Defeats Wairarapa|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WDT19140814.2.30&amp;srpos=11|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Wairarapa Daily Times|date=14 August 1914|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of this last game, a number of Taranaki's players, including Dewar, left to join the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]]: &quot;a brilliant forward... who would almost certainly have gone to Australia this season [on the All Blacks tour] if he had been available for selection&quot;.&lt;ref name=TTM&gt;{{cite news|title=The Taranaki Match|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=SUNCH19140824.2.29&amp;srpos=13&amp;e=-06-1914--10-1914--100--1-byDA---0Taranaki+Ranfurly+rugby+Dewar-ARTICLE-|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=The Sun|date=24 August 1914|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although defeating [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] on 20{{nbsp}}August, Taranaki's pack was particularly weakened by Dewar's absence, and only managed to win 6–5 with a last minute try.&lt;ref name=TTM /&gt; Against a second challenge from Wellington on 10{{nbsp}}September, the conspicuous absence of this &quot;fine leader of forwards&quot; contributed to the loss of the Shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Ranfurly Shield|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=SUNCH19140911.2.4.5&amp;srpos=16|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=The Sun|date=11 September 1914|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His obituary in ''The Sun'' described him as &quot;one of the best forwards in the New Zealand team which visited California... he was fast and very clever, and always gave of his best.

His mother, sister and brother published these words ''in memoriam'':&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our thoughts they ever wander to a soldier's honoured grave,
&lt;br /&gt;Never will we forget the noble sacrifice you made;
&lt;br /&gt;For our hearts arc still united in that same fond love for you,
&lt;br /&gt;And loving thoughts are cherished of one so brave and true.

Your cheery, sunny countenance will not from memory fade,
&lt;br /&gt;For we see you in the photo, in the home you died to save;
&lt;br /&gt;And when our hearts are sore for you we seem to hear you say,
&lt;br /&gt;Break not your heart, dear mother, we will meet on that Eternal Day.

So widely known; so highly esteemed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Memoriam|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19180809.2.3&amp;cl=&amp;srpos=0|accessdate=10 July 2015|work=Evening Post|date=9 August 1918|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
