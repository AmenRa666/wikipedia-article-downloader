'''''Grinder''''' was a gunboat serving as a tender, rather than a commissioned warship, to {{HMS|Anholt|1809|6}}, the British garrison on the island of [[Anholt (Denmark)|Anholt]] during the [[Gunboat War]]. ''Grinder{{'}}''s origins are obscure, but the Danes captured her in 1810 and the British recaptured her in 1811.{{#tag:ref|Another ship named ''Grinder'' was also captured in 1810, but by a French privateer not the Dano-Norwegian navy. The sloop {{HMS|Favorite|1809|2}} then recaptured this ''Grinder'' on 3 October 1810&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16464|startpage=513|date=16 March 1811}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was probably the merchant vessel referred to in the press in January 1811 arriving at Whitehaven - &quot;The ''Grinder'', Turner, loaded with a cargo of wool from Lisbon; taken by a French privateer but retaken by an English sloop of war and carried into Plymouth...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'' Lancaster Gazette'', 19 January 1811.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Caledonian Mercury'' (Edinburgh), 24 January 1811.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} She was sold in 1832.

==Prelude - capture of Anholt==
On 18 May 1809, the 74-gun [[third rate]] [[HMS Standard (1782)|HMS ''Standard'']], under Captain Askew Hollis, led in a squadron that also included the frigate [[HMS Owen Glendower (1808)|''Owen Glendower'']], and the four smaller ships {{HMS|Avenger|1803|2}}, {{HMS|Ranger|1807|2}}, {{HMS|Rose|1806|2}} and {{HMS|Snipe|1801|2}}. Together they captured the island.&lt;ref name=LG16260&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=736|issue=16260|date=23 May 1809}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landing party of seamen and marines under the command of Captain William Selby of ''Owen Glendower'', with the assistance of Captain [[Edward Nicolls]] of the ''Standard''{{'}}s marines, landed. The Danish garrison of 170 men put up a sharp but ineffectual resistance that killed one British marine and wounded two; the garrison then surrendered. The British took immediate possession of the island.&lt;ref name=LG16260/&gt;

==Tender to HMS ''Anholt''==
In 1810 Captain Nicolls, now Governor of Anholt, was concerned about reports of a Danish force gathering in Jutland to retake Anholt.&lt;ref name=Letters/&gt; He therefore ordered boats off Anholt to maintain a watch over [[Randers Fjord]] and [[Grenå]] whenever the wind was fair. To this end he re-launched &quot;GB ''Grinder''&quot;, which had overwintered on the island. Nicolls gave ''Grinder'' a crew made up of 30 seamen and marines from the island's garrison and captained by Master's Mate Thomas Hester.&lt;ref name=Letters/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Danish and German sources, and English language sources based on these, name the captain as Lieutenant Thomas Ester or Esther. Neither of these names appears in British records as a commissioned officer. However, the muster book for HMS ''Anholt'' does list Master's Mate Thomas Hester.&lt;ref name=Anholt&gt;National Archives, Kew, London: ADM/37/2397 - muster book for ''HMS Anholt'' 1810.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Nicolls also assigned ''Grinder'' the mission of intercepting trade along the shore.&lt;ref name=Letters&gt;National Archives, Kew, London: ADM 1/10 - letters from Admiral commanding, Baltic 1810&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grinder'' captured a Danish trading sloop &quot;on the Swedish coast&quot; on 17 March. On the following day Nicolls sent her “to look into the harbour of Harrup”, where she discovered a number of small Danish trading vessels and proceeded to capture five of them “...in sight of the enemies flotilla of gunboats”.&lt;ref name=Letters/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Harrup may be the English rendering of the Danish place name Hurup, now marked on maps as Øster Hurup, on the east coast of Jutland.  Many inner harbours on Jutland were still frozen in at mid-March 1810 and gunboat crews were often on winter leave during the period when the seas were frozen – so the gunboats seen may have been iced in or unmanned.&lt;ref&gt;Wandell (1815), pp.261-262.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Reportedly, these six were among 12 merchantmen that she had captured.

==Capture by the Danes, (1810)==
On 13 April 1810 ''Grinder'' was pursuing two small ships when Senior Lieutenant [[Peter Nicolay Skibsted]],&lt;ref&gt;Topsøe-Jensen og Marquard, Vol. 2, pp. 519-20&lt;/ref&gt; who with four Danish gunboats was convoying eight transport ships from Udbyhøj (at the mouth of the Randers Fjord, Jutland) to [[Samsø]], spotted her. He immediately concealed his gunboats behind the transports, thus tricking ''Grinder'' into drawing closer. As soon as Hester noticed the stratagem, he tried to escape, but Skibsted was successful in the next 90 minutes in rowing up to him, and after a few shots were exchanged, forcing Hester to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Garde p.548&lt;/ref&gt; The muster rolls for HMS ''Anholt'' record Hester and 27 men  as &quot;discharged - prisoner in Denmark&quot; on 17 April 1810. One man was recorded as having died.&lt;ref name=Anholt/&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' reported that &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A Gottenburg mail has brought letters and papers to the 3rd inst. An article, under the date April 21, gives a long account of  the capture of an English gun brig in the Baltic. This vessel had wintered at Anholt. Her loss was two men killed and two wounded. She proved to be the ''Grinder'', Lieutenant Esher.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 14 May 1810&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle'' (London), 14 May 1810.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Danish service (21 April 1810 to 5 July 1811)===
The Danes brought ''Grinder'' into Samsø where they repaired her battle damage. They renamed her ''Prise No.5'',&lt;!---Danish practice in using caps for ship names is neither here nor there at Wikipedia - it also happens to be the current Royal Navy policy as laid down in JSP101, but Wikipedia has its own house style---&gt; and Midshipman Oldelan then commissioned her on 21 April 1810; in Danish service she was armed with:
*One 24-pounder cannon 
*One 24-pounder [[carronade]] and 
*One 4-pounder howitzer.&lt;ref&gt;Record card for [http://www.orlogsmuseet.dk/G/pages/Grinder(1810).htm ''Grinder'', renamed ''Prise No 5'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 1810 ''Prise No.5''  sailed to Fladstrand (modern name [[Frederikshavn]]). There she joined the flotilla under Senior Lieutenant Falsen,&lt;ref&gt;Wandell (1815), p.268.&lt;/ref&gt;  which already included two large and two smaller gunboats, plus the captured {{HMS|Minx|1801|2}}. ''Prise No.5'' then moved to Skagen, (Northern Jutland) where a storm forced her aground on 4 and 5 August. She was refloated and in December she sailed to Fladstrand, where she was laid up.  From March 1811 ''Prise No.5'' was based at Fladstrand.

==Recapture (1811)==
The Danes record that on 5 July 1811 the British recaptured ''Prise No.5'' between the islands of Hjelmen and Sejerø when the Fladstrand flotilla attacked a British convoy.&lt;ref&gt;Degenkolv (1906), p.216.&lt;/ref&gt; On that day HMS ''Sheldrake'' was in company with the [[third rate]]s {{HMS|Cressy|1810|2}}, {{HMS|Defence|1763|2}} and {{HMS|Dictator|1783|2}}, and the gun-brig {{HMS|Bruizer|1804|2}}, with the British warships protecting a convoy of merchantmen. As they passed [[Hjelm (island)|Hjelm Island]] a flotilla of 17 Dano-Norwegian gunboats and 10 rowboats came out to attack the convoy. The attackers lost four gunboats; the convoy had no losses. During the action, ''Sheldrake'' captured the Danish gunboats ''No. 2'' and ''No. 5''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16692|startpage=112|date=12 January 1813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
While laid up at Sheerness, ''Grinder'' was offered for sale by the Admiralty on 24 July 1832&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=18965 |date=10 August 1832 |startpage=1838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold on 22 August the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ColledgeWarlow2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.
