[[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] '''Richard Elmer Ellsworth''' (July 18, 1911 – March 18, 1953)&lt;ref name=fndgr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=17207905&amp;PIpi=12944592 |title=Gen Richard Elmer Ellsworth (1911 - 1953) - Find A Grave Photos |publisher=Findagrave.com |date=2008-09-20 |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States Air Force]] commander during the early part of the [[Cold War]]. [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]] near [[Rapid City, South Dakota]] is named in his honor.

==Early life==
Born in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], Ellsworth joined the [[Pennsylvania National Guard]] in 1929. In 1931 he was accepted into the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]] (West Point) and after graduation in June 1935, he underwent pilot training at [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph]] and [[Kelly Air Force Base|Kelly]] fields in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Ellsworth was assigned to squadron duties in October 1936 at [[Mitchel Air Force Base|Mitchel Field]] on [[Long Island]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]. The army promoted him to [[First lieutenant#U.S. Army.2C U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|first lieutenant]] in June 1938 and transferred him back to Kelly Field and later to the [[McClellan Airfield|Sacramento Air Depot]] in [[California]]. He spent time studying [[meteorology]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], graduating with a master's degree. He received promotion to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] in October 1940, and by December 1941, Ellsworth was a [[Major (United States)|major]] and by February 1942 a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]].

==World War II==
In the spring of 1942, Ellsworth was reassigned to transport pilot duty in [[Alaska]]. Later that year, he was sent to study weather-related phenomena in the South Pacific, where he was promoted to full [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in December. Beginning in July 1943, as commander of the Tenth Weather Region, he flew more than 400 combat missions in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]], logging a total of 780 hours for the 10th and 14th Air Forces. For his heroics, he received [[battle star]]s for eight different campaigns, and further distinguished himself earning the [[Legion of Merit]], two [[Distinguished Flying Cross (U.S.)|Distinguished Flying Crosses]], three [[Air Medal]]s, and even the Chinese Air Force Wings.

==Cold War==
After the war, Ellsworth returned stateside for reassignment as Chief of Operations and Training for the Air Weather Service in Washington. He later commanded the 308th Reconnaissance Group at Morrison Field, [[Florida]] as well as the Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base of California. In July 1950, Ellsworth graduated from the [[Air War College]] at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] in [[Alabama]] and was reassigned Chief of Plans for the 2nd Air Force at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]], [[Louisiana]]. Colonel Ellsworth was assigned as the wing commander [[28th Bomb Wing|28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]] at Rapid City AFB South Dakota in 1950. In September 1952, he received promotion to the rank of [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]].

Retired squadron maintenance officers at the base remember Ellsworth as an unusual, hands-on commander, who would sometimes assist mechanics working late into the night in efforts to ready aircraft.

In 1952, Ellsworth befriended Hollywood producer [[Herman Cohen]] during the filming of ''[[Battles of Chief Pontiac]].'' The picture was shot on-location in western South Dakota, using [[Lakota people|Lakota]] Indians from a nearby reservation to portray the Native Americans. General Ellsworth allowed personnel from the base to act as extras in the film, portraying British and Hessian troops. Ellsworth sent out Air Force water trucks to assist the production crew. General Ellsworth's three sons were allowed to visit the set and meet the actors.

On March 18, 1953, Ellsworth was co-piloting a [[Convair B-36 Peacemaker|Convair RB-36H Peacemaker]] bomber on a 25-hour journey as part of a simulated combat mission flying from [[Lajes (Praia da Vitória)|Lajes]], [[Azores]] back to the Rapid City base.&lt;ref name=sdcbrep&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R-ZXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=efYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5433%2C6273858 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=B-36 bomber reported down|date=March 19, 1953 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of their exercise, the bomber's crew was observing radio silence and had switched off their radar guidance, flying via [[celestial navigation]].

They had planned to fly low over the ocean, steadily increasing to higher altitudes before reaching the mountainous countryside of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Late into the night, the aircraft struck bad weather and went off course, reaching Newfoundland 90 minutes earlier than planned. At 4:10 am near Burgoyne's Cove, inland from Nut Cove, [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay]], Newfoundland, with sleet, fog,&lt;ref name=wdfnd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1ogTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LYsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2635%2C1937543 |newspaper=Free Lance-Star |location=Fredericksburg, Virginia |agency=Associated Press |title=Woodsmen find 9 bodies near wreckage of bomber |date=March 19, 1953 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; freezing drizzle, and visibility estimated at less than {{convert|1/8|mi|sing=on}}, the plane struck an {{convert|896|ft|sing=on}} hill at {{convert|800|ft|0}} with a ground speed of {{convert|202|knot}}. The aircraft's propellers severed the tops of pine trees while the plane's left wing hit the ground, tore off, and spilled fuel.&lt;ref name=ttfldom&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SOZXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=efYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5426%2C6839342 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=33 fliers dead or missing; two bombers crash |date=March 19, 1953 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the plane impacted some thousand feet (300 m) further. The impact and subsequent fire from the plane's fuel tanks scorched an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} trench in the countryside. Loggers on a nearby hill spotted the fireball and alerted rescuers, but all 23 on board were killed on impact.&lt;ref name=allabd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Omg1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xCMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4713%2C3304871 |newspaper=The Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=All aboard B-36 believed dead |date=March 20, 1953 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same night, a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants|Boeing SB-29 Superfortress]] search and rescue plane was sent out to assist in search efforts. It disappeared and was presumed crashed as well.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In the aftermath of the crash, an accident investigation board recommended new procedures to scan more frequently for approaching high terrain and to climb to safer altitudes before approaching within {{convert|200| mi|-1}} of a water-land boundary. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] personally went to the Rapid City base and renamed it Ellsworth Air Force Base, to honor the general on June 13.&lt;ref name=honath&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ellsworth.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123293743 |publisher=United States Air Force |title=Honoring a true hero |date=March 13, 2012 |first=Hrair H. |last=Palyan |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellsworth was buried at [[Black Hills National Cemetery]] in [[Sturgis, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name=fndgr/&gt;

==Crash site==
The remote crash site is one of only two B-36 crash sites still remaining (the other is in [[Alaska]]). Wreckage is strewn across {{convert|3/4|mi|sing=on}} of terrain, and remains today where it landed. The site is located about a 40-minute hike away from the nearest parking area. A nearby memorial features a propeller from the bomber, and a bronze plaque listing the names of the deceased crewmembers. The location of the crash site is at approximately {{coord|48.1886|N|53.6602|W}}.
