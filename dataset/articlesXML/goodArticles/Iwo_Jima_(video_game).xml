'''''Iwo Jima''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] video game developed and published by [[Personal Software Services]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1986. It is the second instalment to the ''Strategic Wargames'' series. The game is set during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|Pacific Ocean theatre]] of [[World War II]] and revolves around the [[United States Marine Corps]]' objective to secure the island of [[Iwo Jima]] from the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].

The game is a turn-based strategy and focuses on the player using their units to attack Japanese forces in order to capture the island. The player assumes control of the Marine Corps and must eliminate all Japanese forces by ground, air, or naval combat. The game received mixed reviews upon release. Critics praised the game's value for money and easy difficulty for novice gamers; however, many criticised the graphics and [[game mechanics|mechanics]].

The game is a [[turn-based strategy]] focuses on the invasion and land battles of [[Iwo Jima]]. The player commands the [[United States Marine Corps]] against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], who are occupying the islands as part of the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II]]. The game is menu-based and only allows the player to use four command functions; move, attack, land and pass.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt; Depending on the difficulty set, the game lasts 32 to 36 turns and can only be won by eliminating all Japanese forces from the island before the final turn ends.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt;&lt;ref name=CVG/&gt; During the game, the enemy may fortify their positions, launch air strikes against the [[United States Navy]] fleet or may perform suicide attacks if their unit is about to be wiped out. The player also has the ability to order air strikes against the enemy, if weather permits.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt;

At the beginning of the game, the player has to allocate a number of American troops in order to establish a [[beachhead]] on one of the six beaches of the island. However, many of the beaches are scattered with [[land mine]]s and may provide an initial disadvantage to the assault.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt; Throughout the game, the player may call in air strikes and other assaults, however they are only available after the American forces are attacked or if the enemy retreats to an inaccessible location.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt; At any time in the game, the player is also able to request troop reinforcements from the fleet.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt;&lt;ref name=CU/&gt; Furthermore, Japanese air forces may sink American battleships throughout the game, although the player will be given the opportunity to shoot them down.&lt;ref name=SU/&gt; In addition, a Japanese submarine will sink American [[gunboat]]s at random intervals, and cannot be destroyed in any way.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt;&lt;ref name=CU/&gt; There is no save function in the game.&lt;ref name=CVG/&gt;

==Background==
[[Personal Software Services]] was founded in [[Coventry]], England, by Gary Mays and Richard Cockayne in 1981.&lt;ref name=PSS&gt;{{cite journal|title=History of PSS|journal=Your Computer|date=13 June 1986|volume=6|issue=6|pages=84â€“85|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-computer-magazine-1986-06/YourComputer_1986_06#page/n83/mode/2up|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company were known for creating games that revolved around historic war battles and conflicts, such as ''[[Theatre Europe]]'', ''Bismark'' and ''[[Falklands '82]]''. The company had a partnership with French video game developer [[ERE Informatique]], and published localised versions of their products to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=aisle&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Software Services overview|url=http://www.retroisle.com/pubspotlight.php?n=PSS|publisher=Retro Aisle|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Cockayne took a decision to alter their products for release on 16-bit consoles, as he found that smaller 8-bit consoles such as the [[ZX Spectrum]] lacked the processing power for larger strategy games. The decision was falsely interpreted as &quot;pulling out&quot; from the Spectrum market by [[video game journalism|video game journalist]] Phillipa Irving.&lt;ref name=pull&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarratt|first1=Steve|title=Seasonal Drought|journal=Crash|date=May 1988|url=https://archive.org/stream/crash-magazine-52/Crash_52_May_1988#page/n5/mode/2up/search/pss|page=7|issue=52|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following years of successful sales throughout the mid 1980s, Personal Software Services experienced financial difficulties, in what Cockayne admitted in a retrospective interview that &quot;he took his eye off the ball&quot;. The company was acquired by [[Mirrorsoft]] in February 1987,&lt;ref name=feb&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mirrorsoft has new strategy with PSS|journal=Personal Computing Weekly|date=12 February 1987|volume=6|issue=7|page=6|url=https://archive.org/stream/popular-computing-weekly-1987-02-12/PopularComputing_Weekly_Issue_1987-02-12#page/n0/mode/2up|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later dispossessed by the company due to strains of debt.&lt;ref name=pain&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnot|first1=Chris|title=Taking pain out of gain|journal=The Independent|date=26 March 1995|accessdate=4 October 2015|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/taking-pain-out-of-gain-1612866.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game received mixed reviews form critics upon release. Both Gwyn Hughes of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' and a reviewer of ''ZX Computing'' praised the game's value for money and heralded it as a &quot;good introduction&quot; to the wargaming genre, although Hughes believed that ''Iwo Jima'' was unlikely to provide established tacticians with a &quot;major challenge&quot;&lt;ref name=YS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=Gwyn|title=Iwo Jima review|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/iwojima.htm|publisher=Your Sinclair|accessdate=22 November 2015|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reviewer of ''ZX Computing'' was concerned that the game was &quot;too easy&quot;.&lt;ref name=ZX&gt;{{cite journal|title=Theatre Europe and Iwo Jima review|journal=ZX Computing|date=August 1986|issue=86|page=43|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/ZXComputing/Issue8608/Pages/ZXComputing860800043.jpg|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sean Masterson of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' criticised the graphics, stating that it was &quot;let down by poor unit markers and terrain features&quot;.&lt;ref name=crash&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masterson|first1=Sean|title=Iwo Jima review|journal=Crash|date=July 1986|issue=30|pages=55, 56|url=http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/review.aspx?gid=2775&amp;rid=6173|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Rook of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' asserted that the game was overall &quot;competent&quot;, however he summarised it as &quot;failing to excite&quot;. Rook also added that the game was well implemented and &quot;inspiring&quot;.&lt;ref name=SU&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rook|first1=Gary|title=Iwo Jima review|journal=Sinclair User|date=September 1986|issue=54|page=47|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/SinclairUser/Issue054/Pages/SinclairUser05400047.jpg|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' criticised the game for having an &quot;awkward mechanism&quot; due to the lack of a save feature and neglecting historic realism. However, he compared the historical accuracy of the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] for being more accurate than ''[[Falklands '82]]''{{'}}s interpretation of the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref name=CVG&gt;{{cite journal|title=Iwo Jima and Theatre Europe review|journal=Computer and Video Games|date=October 1986|issue=42|page=10|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue061/Pages/CVG06100042.jpg|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Reed of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' stated that the game is &quot;ideal&quot; for novice players and also praised the simplicity of the controls, despite suggesting that experienced gamers of the genre would prefer &quot;something more complex&quot;.&lt;ref name=CU&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=Mark|title=Iwo Jima review|journal=Computer Gamer|date=August 1986|issue=17|page=94|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gamer_Issue_17_1986-08_Argus_Press_GB#page/n93/mode/1up|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masterson similarly criticised the game's suitability for experienced gamers, suggesting that any appeal for a more experienced player is likely to be &quot;very limited&quot;.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt;
