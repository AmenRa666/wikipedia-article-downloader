==Stub article==
This is a very short article, and I want to explain why. The other major actions at Ticonderoga (1758, 1775, 1777) all have enough info to need their own articles. Once I'm satisfied with those three, I'll remove individual battle descriptions from the Fort Ticonderoga Artcle. Leaving this one as a stand alone article just seems to balance or complete the set.

==Map origin==
Documentation concerning the creation of the map ([[:File:Ticonderoga attack plan2.jpg]]).

The map is signed May 29, 1759, by William Brasier, a draftsman in the British Army.  Brasier reported to Lt. Thomas Sowers, who reported to Colonel [[James Montresor]], Amherst's chief engineer.  Field research was performed by Dietrick/Diedrich/Diederich Brehm/Breem/Brheem/Bhreem, a lieutenant in the 1st battalion 60th foot under Captain George Etherington, who reported to Colonel Frederick Haldimand, in command at Fort Edward. (For chain of command, see [http://books.google.com/books?id=p_ygAAAAMAAJ the regimental chronicle of the 60th foot].)

Timeline:
*February 23, 1759: [[Thomas Gage]] (Albany) writes Haldimand (Fort Edward): &quot;I very much approve of your proposal that a party from the forces under your command should accompany the Indians in their intended scout towards Ticonderoga, and that we should seize such an opportunity to send some skillful officer to examine the enemy's works ... I know of no person so proper for such a piece of service as Lieutenant Brehm, have just sent for him to propose this business to him ... I desire also that Rogers, with as many Rangers as can be spared, may be of this party.&quot; (FTB vol 11, pp. 35-36)
*March 3, 1759: [[Robert Rogers]] leads scouting expedition from Fort Edward, Brehm in party (Rogers journal)
*Brehm's orders include: (FTB vol 11, p. 37)
**comment on 1758 works
**examine road from landing to sawmill to fort for obstructions
**do mountains on east side command entrenchments and fort, at what distance
**potential siting of roads to conceal movements
**&quot;he is to correct the plan given to him&quot; [MP-this is probably Matthew Clerk's plan]
*Brehm's report: (FTB vol 11, pp. 38-42)
**includes his own drawing (missing at time of publication, 1963) with lettered annotation, although only M,N,O appear to describe the same thing that appears on the Brasier map
*March 10, 1759: Rogers and company return to Fort Edward from scout (Rogers journal)
*Rogers' report: (FTB vol 11, pp. 46-48)
**depart March 3, reach landing place 5th at 8pm (p46)
**Rogers, Brehm, party go to &quot;isthmus&quot; overlooking fort to observe works
**Brehm, 10 men go into entrenchments near works that night &quot;having done his business to [Brehm's] satisfaction&quot;
**begin return on 6th 3am (p47)
*March 12, 1759: Gage to Haldimand, congratulating on successful scout (Report on Canadian Archives)
*March 15, 1759: Gage to Haldimand, Brehm has arrived in Albany (Report on Canadian Archives)
*April 3, 1759: Amherst shows Montresor Brehm's plan (in NYC); Montresor suggests additions:  mentions carrying boats &quot;across the two necks&quot;, presumably referencing the carries to map locations D and I. (Montresor journal)
*April 16, 1759: Montresor writes to Lt Sowers (no details, but may concern Oswego/Niagara planning) (Montresor journal)
*April 22, 1759: &quot;Brazier&quot; arrives from Boston (Montresor journal)
*April 28, 1759: Amherst departs NYC for Albany (Montresor journal)
*May 12, 1759: Amherst and Montresor meet in Albany re Oswego/Niagara planning (Montresor journal)
*May 13, 1759: Montresor says he &quot;gave [Amherst] also my Project for Ticonderoga&quot;.  (Montresor journal) This probably refers to something Brasier eventually copied to make the map reproduced here, or to [http://books.google.com/books?id=a20YAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Montresor%20Ticonderoga%20Project&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=RA3-PA63#v=onepage&amp;q=Montresor%20Ticonderoga%20Project&amp;f=false another manuscript] (see item #512, this map is #509).
*June 3, 1759: Amherst departs Albany for Fort Edward (Montresor journal)
*June 5, 1759: Montresor wrote to &quot;Mr. Frederick with a plan of the attack of Ticonderoga&quot; (Montresor journal)
*June 13, 1759: Montresor orders &quot;Brazier&quot; to Fort Edward (Montresor journal)
*June 15, 1759: Montresor, Gage, other officers depart Albany for Fort Edward (Montresor journal)

Brehm discusses defenses with Rogers (includes author's commentary comparing it to Matthew Clerk's analysis in 1758): [http://books.google.com/books?id=N2sM-RCkVyUC&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=Amherst%20Brehm&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA214#v=onepage&amp;q=Amherst%20Brehm&amp;f=false]

Synthesized narrative:

Frederick Haldimand, commander at Fort Edward, proposed a scouting expedition toward Carillon for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering.  Gage approved the request, ordering Rogers to head the scout, and adding the suggestion that engineer Brehm accompany the scout to examine the enemy works.  Gage and Haldimand issue orders to Brehm and Rogers, who left Fort Edward on March 3 in a party of 358.  By the evening of March 5 they reached landing at the northern end of Lake George.  Rogers, Brehm, and a supporting party climbed to a place (probably Mount Defiance) with a view of Carillon that evening, and discussed what they saw.  Brehm made detailed drawings of the area.  Later that evening Brehm and a party of 10 entered the outer entrenchments to inspect them more closely.  On completion of this work, a party of about 100 went around to the east shore of Champlain where they surprised a French work crew, taking prisoners and killing much of the crew.  Pursued by a party from the fort, they quickly retreated, reaching Sabbathday Point (50 miles of hiking through sometimes deep snow) later that day.  By March 8 they had returned to Fort Edward.

Brehm delivered his report to Gage in Albany, who forwarded them to Amherst in NYC.  Amherst discussed the plan with Montresor on April 3, when they agreed, with modest changes, to Brehm's plan.  After Amherst approved the final plan on May 13, Montresor ordered copies made.  The copy which is the source of this image was made by William Brasier at Albany, and completed May 29, in time for the army command's departure for Fort Edward in early June.
