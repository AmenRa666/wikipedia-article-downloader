{{History of Malta}}

The '''fortifications of Malta''' consist of a number of walled cities, [[citadel]]s, [[fort]]s, [[Watchtower|towers]], [[Artillery battery|batteries]], [[redoubt]]s, [[Entrenchment (fortification)|entrenchments]] and [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]]. The [[fortification]]s were built over thousands of years, from around 1450 BC to the mid-20th century, and they are a result of the [[Malta|Maltese islands]]' strategic position and natural harbours, which have made them very desirable for various powers.

The earliest known fortifications in Malta are defensive walls built around [[Bronze Age]] settlements. The [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] built a number of defensive walls around important settlements, but very little remains of these survive today. By the late medieval period, the main fortifications on Malta were the capital [[Mdina]], the [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]] on Gozo, the [[Fort St. Angelo|Castrum Maris]] and a few coastal towers or lookout posts.

The fortifications of Malta were greatly improved while the islands were [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|ruled by the Order of St. John]] between 1530 and 1798. The Hospitallers built new [[bastion]]ed fortifications, such as the [[fortifications of Birgu]] and [[Fortifications of Valletta|Valletta]], and upgraded the medieval defences. By the end of the 18th century, Malta had extensive fortifications around the [[Grand Harbour]] and [[Marsamxett Harbour|Marsamxett]], as well as a coastal defence system consisting of towers, batteries, redoubts and entrenchments.

Following a [[French occupation of Malta|brief French occupation]], the islands fell under [[British Empire|British]] rule in 1800. Between the 1870s and the 1900s a number of [[polygonal fort]]s and batteries were built around Malta's coastline and along the [[Victoria Lines|Great Fault]]. In the 1930s and 1940s, [[Fort Campbell (Malta)|Fort Campbell]], a series of pillboxes and a number of anti-aircraft batteries were constructed, and these were the last fortifications to be built in Malta.

Malta's fortifications are considered to be among the best examples of military architecture anywhere in the world. Major General [[Whitworth Porter]] of the [[Royal Engineers]], called Malta &quot;the most powerful artificial fortress in the world&quot; in his 1858 book ''A History of the Fortress of Malta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Whitworth|title=A History of the Fortress of Malta|date=1858|location=[[Valletta]]|page=iv|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=wc0NAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1893 book ''The Story of Malta'', [[Maturin Murray Ballou]] wrote that &quot;there is not a more complete system of fortifications extant, in any part of the world, than the cordon of defensive structures at Malta.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballou|first1=Maturin M.|title=The Story of Malta|date=1893|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co]]|location=[[Boston]]|pages=57|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34036/34036-h/34036-h.htm#Page_57|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British architect [[Quentin Hughes (architect)|Quentin Hughes]] referred to Malta's fortifications as &quot;for sheer concentration and majesty quite unmatched&quot;,&lt;ref name=militarch-restoration&gt;{{cite news|title=ERDF Fortifications Restoration, Malta|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/News/erdf-fortifications-restoration-malta.html|accessdate=20 December 2014|work=MilitaryArchitecture.com|date=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while judge and historian [[Giovanni Bonello]] said that &quot;nowhere in the world are fortifications more extensive, more impressive, more outstanding than they are in Malta.&quot;&lt;ref name=times-2012-11-18&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bonello|first1=Giovanni|title=Let’s hide the majestic bastions|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121118/life-features/Let-s-hide-the-majestic-bastions.445894|accessdate=21 November 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and Medieval fortifications (pre-1530)==
[[File:Borg in-Nadur ruins.jpeg|thumb|left|Bronze Age defensive wall at [[Borġ in-Nadur]]]]
The first fortifications in Malta were built during the [[Bronze Age]]. At least six sites have been identified as possible fortified settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=Maltese Fortifications|journal=Civilization|date=1984|volume=1|pages=22-25|publisher=PEG Ltd|location=[[Ħamrun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best preserved of these is the village of [[Borġ in-Nadur]], close to the modern town of [[Birżebbuġa]]. Around 1450 BC, the inhabitants of the village built a 4.5m high D-shaped bastion to bar access to their village. The wall was built facing inland, showing that the people living in the village were more afraid of attacks from the land than from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Borg in-Nadur|url=http://www.touristlink.com/malta/borg-in-nadur/overview.html|website=touristlink.com|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In around 700 BC, the [[Phoenicia]]ns founded and fortified the city of Maleth on one of the highest points of the island, far away from the sea. Eventually the city was taken over by the [[Roman Empire]] and it was renamed Melite. The city was again renamed Medina by the Arabs which led to its present name [[Mdina]]. Its fortifications were modified a number of times over time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=The 'Castellu di la Chitati' the medieval castle of the walled town of Mdina|journal=Arx – Online Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification|date=2004–2007|issue=1–4|pages=3–11|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/Arx/arx1_4_2008.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although most were dismantled and rebuilt between the 16th and 18th centuries, some foundations of the ancient Punic-Roman ramparts, as well as various medieval remains, were recently discovered during excavations.&lt;ref name=mdina-punic-roman&gt;{{cite news|title=Remains of Punic Rampart Wall Discovered at Mdina|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/News/remains-of-punic-rampart-wall-discovered-at-mdina.html|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=militaryarchitecture.com|date=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of several [[Punic-Roman towers in Malta|round towers]] have been found in Malta, and they are believed to date back to the late Punic or Roman periods. It is possible that these were used as watchtowers, but some historians dispute this since their locations do not really make sense in defensive systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ta' Ġawhar Tower|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/00021.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Al-Himyarī]], when the Arabs captured Malta in 870 AD, they besieged, captured, sacked and dismantled a fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brincat|first1=Joseph M.|title=New Light on the Darkest Age in Malta’s History|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/1995proc%20Malta%20870-1054%20by%20J.M.%20Brincat.pdf|website=melitensiawth.com|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Z5HkRHsR|archivedate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gozo - Rabat - Zitatelle - N.JPG|thumb|The northern walls of the [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]] were built in the 15th century]]
By 1241, the ''Gran Castello'' or [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]] on [[Gozo]] was definitely fortified, although a settlement on the hill had existed since the Bronze Age. The city's fortifications were improved over the years, and the northern walls of the city that still stand today were built around the 15th century by the [[Crown of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History Note|url=http://www.victoria.org.mt/history-note/|publisher=Victoria Local Council|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Fort St Angelo|Castrum Maris]]'' was built sometime in the Middle Ages. The castle definitely existed by the 13th century, and it was involved in the [[Battle of Malta]] of 1283. By the early 16th century, it belonged to the de Nava family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Information on Maltese Nobility|url=http://www.maltesenobility.com/info.asp|website=The Maltese Nobility|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 15th century, the local militia had a number of watch posts around the Maltese islands, and in some cases there might have been fortified coastal watchtowers at these posts. One of these towers is known to have been built at [[Fort Saint Elmo|St Elmo Point]] on the Sciberras Peninsula by the Aragonese in 1488.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Debono|first1=Charles|title=Coastal Towers|url=http://www.mellieha.com/places_interest/fortifications/coastal_towers.htm|website=Mellieha.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospitaller fortifications (1530–1798)==
===Harbour area===
[[File:Malta - Senglea - Triq it-Tarzna + Fort Saint Michael (Upper Barrakka Gardens) 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Seaward [[fortifications of Senglea]]]]
In 1530, the Maltese islands along with the North African port city of [[Tripoli]] were given to the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. The knights settled in the town of [[Birgu]] and made it their capital. Soon after their arrival, the Order rebuilt the ''Castrum Maris'', calling it [[Fort Saint Angelo]]. Later on, the entire town of Birgu began to be surrounded by new [[Fortifications of Birgu|fortifications]], in a similar style to the Order's [[Fortifications of Rhodes|earlier defences in Rhodes]]. Birgu's land front was built by 1540.&lt;ref name=birgulc&gt;{{cite web|title=Birgu's Fortifications|url=http://birgu.gov.mt/content/birgus-fortifications|publisher=Birgu Local Council|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Invasion of Gozo (1551)|attack of 1551]], the Order realised the need to build more defences. Two forts were built in 1552 - [[Fort Saint Elmo]] at the tip of the Sciberras Peninsula, on the site of an Aragonese watchtower, and [[Fort Saint Michael]] on Isola. In 1553, a new [[Fortifications of Senglea|fortified city]] began to be built around Fort Saint Michael, and it was named [[Senglea]] after the Grand Master who built it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senglea|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1496.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malta - Valletta - Triq l-Assedju l-Kbir+St. Andrew's Bastion (Ferry Sliema-Valletta) 01 ies.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Andrew's Bastion in [[Valletta]]]]
In 1565, the Ottomans attacked again in the [[Great Siege of Malta]]. Fort Saint Elmo fell after fierce fighting (in which the Ottoman general [[Dragut Reis]] was killed), but the knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived. By the end of the siege, most of the fortifications had been destroyed in the attacks, so they were rebuilt. The Grand Master, [[Jean Parisot de Valette]], decided to build a new fortified capital on the Sciberras Peninsula. The first stone of the new city was laid down in 1566, and it was called [[Valletta]]. The [[Fortifications of Valletta|city walls]], which were constructed mainly in the 1560s and 1570s, remain largely intact to this day, and they include bastions, cavaliers, counterguards and a ditch. The ruined Fort Saint Elmo was rebuilt and integrated into the city walls. The area around St Elmo was strengthened a number of times later on in the 17th century, especially by the building of the Carafa Enceinte in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort St. Elmo|url=http://heritagemalta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FORT-ST-ELMO.pdf|website=[[Heritage Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206083119/http://heritagemalta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FORT-ST-ELMO.pdf|archivedate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malta - Floriana - Triq Sa Maison - Sa Maison Bastion (MSTHC) 02 ies.jpg|thumb|San Salvatore Bastion and Counterguard, part of the [[Floriana Lines]]]]
With the development of new technologies, by the 17th century it was realised that while Valletta's fortifications were well designed, they were not strong enough to withstand a heavy attack. Because of this, the [[Floriana Lines]], encircling Valletta's original land front, were built from 1635 to the 1640s. In the 18th century, a suburb developed between the Floriana Lines and Valletta's land front, and it became known as [[Floriana]], today a town in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Attard|first1=Sonia|title=The Valletta Fortifications|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/history/vallettafort.shtml|website=aboutmalta.com|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1638, the [[Santa Margherita Lines]] began to be built encircling the land fronts of Birgu and Sengela. Works were suspended in 1645 due to a lack of funds, and they remained unfinished for many years. Following the [[Cretan War (1645–69)#Fall of Candia|fall of Candia]] to the Ottomans in 1669, a second line of fortifications, the [[Cottonera Lines]], began to be built encircling both Birgu and Senglea, as well as the unfinished Santa Margherita Lines. They were begun in 1670, but works stopped in 1680 again due to a lack of funds. By this time, the bastioned enceinte had been built, although other crucial parts had not yet been constructed. Eventually, some effort was done to complete both the Santa Margherita and Cottonera Lines in the early 18th century, although some of the planned ravelins, cavaliers, ditch and other fortifications were never constructed. [[Fort San Salvatore]] was built on one of the Cottonera Lines bastions in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Margherita Lines – Sta Margherita Lines|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1526.pdf|publisher=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|accessdate=21 December 2014|date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cottonera Lines|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1544.pdf|publisher=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|accessdate=21 December 2014|date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fort Ricasoli]] was built between 1670 and 1698 commanding the eastern arm of the Grand Harbour. It has an irregular plan following the coastline, with bastions, curtains and ravelins. The fort was improved later on in the 18th century. Fort Saint Angelo was also extensively modified in the 1690s, when it was upgraded with the building of various batteries and other defences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort Ricasoli|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1655.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malta 230915 Valletta 08.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Manoel]] as seen from the bastions of Valletta]]
From 1723 to 1733, [[Fort Manoel]] was built on [[Manoel Island]] in [[Marsamxett Harbour]], so as to protect Valletta's western flank. The [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] fort is square in shape, with four corner bastions. It was the last major fort to be built with the bastioned trace in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Fort Manoel|journal=ARX Occasional Papers|date=2014|volume=4|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Journals/arx-fort-manoel-occasional-papers-4.html|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Order's last major fortification in the harbour area was [[Fort Tigné]], built at [[Tigné Point]] between 1793 and 1795. It was built to protect the entrance of Marsamxett, along with Fort Saint Elmo. The fort's architecture is very different from the Order's earlier forts, and although very small by 18th century standards, it has been described as among the most revolutionary and influential of Malta's fortifications as it is a very early example of a [[polygonal fort]]. Many other polygonal forts were built by the British later on in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Fort Tigné 1792|journal=ARX Occasional Papers|date=2011|volume=1|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Journals/arx-occasional-papers-fort-tigne-1792.html|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mdina and the Cittadella===
[[File:Malta - Mdina - City wall+ditch 01 ies.jpg|thumb|De Redin Bastion in [[Mdina]]]]

Although [[Mdina]] was no longer the capital city, the Order still strengthened [[Fortifications of Mdina|the city's defences]], and gradually upgraded its medieval walls into a gunpowder fortress. In the 1540s, during the magistracy of [[Juan de Homedes y Coscon]], two bastions were built on the corners of the city's land front. The central De Redin Bastion was built by Grand Master [[Martin de Redin]] in the mid-17th century. The city was damaged during the [[1693 Sicily earthquake]], and repairs were made over the course of the 18th century. During the rebuilding, the city's entrance was replaced by a larger gate by the architect [[Charles François de Mondion]] in 1724, and the last modifications were made in 1746, when Despuig Bastion was completed. There were other plans to strengthen the city but these were not implemented as the Order focused on the fortifications at the harbour area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fortification building spree left Mdina out|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-03-30/news/fortification-building-spree-left-mdina-out-4431872002/|accessdate=21 December 2014|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defences of Gozo's [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]] were also improved by the Order. In 1551, the city was devastated by an Ottoman raid which took almost Gozo's entire population as slaves. The city's entrance and southern walls were later completely rebuilt between 1599 and 1622, although the city's northern walls were retained in their original medieval form. The early 17th century modifications included the construction of bastions, cavaliers, magazines and a battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restoration of the Cittadella|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/News/restoration-of-the-cittadella.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coastal fortifications===
[[File:Malta - St. Paul's Bay - Triq San Frangisk-Triq San Giraldu - St. Paul's Bay Tower 05 ies.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wignacourt Tower]] in [[St. Paul's Bay]]]]

Despite the significant fortifications in the harbour area, the rest of the islands remained mostly undefended until the 17th century, and they were prone to attacks (such as the [[Invasion of Gozo (1551)|raid of 1551]]). This changed in 1605, when [[Garzes Tower]] was built in [[Mġarr, Gozo|Mġarr]] on the island of [[Gozo]]. This watchtower no longer exists as it was demolished by the British administration in 1848.&lt;ref name=wignacourt/&gt;

In the following years, more towers were built around the islands. The first group, the [[Wignacourt towers]], were built between 1610 and 1620. Six of these were built, and they were more than just watchtowers as they formed significant strongpoints intended to protect vulnerable sections of the coast from attack. Of the six towers, one collapsed in around 1715 and another was demolished in 1888. The other four towers survive to this day.&lt;ref name=wignacourt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Wignacourt’s Bastioned Towers|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/News/wignacourts-bastioned-towers.html|website=Military Architecture|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malta - Mgarr - Triq Ghajn Tuffieha - Ghajn Tuffieha Tower 03 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Għajn Tuffieħa Tower]] in [[Mġarr]]]]
Seven more towers were built between 1637 and 1638. These were much smaller than the Wignacourt towers, as they were built as watchtowers and a communication link to warn the Order's base in the Grand Harbour of an attack. In 1647, [[Saint Agatha's Tower]] was built in [[Mellieħa]]. This was a large tower intended as a strongpoint, and was built in the style of the Wignacourt towers. Two more towers were built at [[Dwejra]] and [[Xlendi]] on Gozo in 1650 and 1652. The ten towers built between 1637 and 1652 are collectively known as the [[Lascaris towers]] after the Grand Master who built them, and nine of them survive to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Naxxar and its fortifications|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/naxxar-and-its-fortifications.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malta - Naxxar - Tul il-Kosta - Ghallis Tower 02 ies.jpg|thumb|left|[[Għallis Tower]] in [[Naxxar]]]]
Another series of towers were built between 1658 and 1659. Fourteen towers were built in all, which are together known as the [[De Redin towers]]. These were based on the Lascaris towers and had the same function as a communication link. 13 towers were built on mainland Malta having an identical design, and 8 of these survive intact while 2 are in ruins. The fourteenth tower, [[Mġarr ix-Xini Tower]], was built on Gozo in 1661 with a slightly different design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Mgarr ix-Xini Tower, Gozo|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/mgarr-ix-xini-tower-gozo.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last coastal watchtower to be built was [[Sopu Tower]], which was constructed in Gozo in 1667. The tower had almost collapsed but was rebuilt in the early 2000s and it is now in good condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isopu Tower (it-Torri ta' Isopu), Nadur, Gozo|url=http://dinlarthelwa.org/properties/restored-in-partnership/isopu-tower-it-torri-ta-isopu-nadur-gozo/|publisher=[[Din l-Art Ħelwa]]|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Anthony's Battery 1.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Anthony's Battery]] in [[Qala, Malta|Qala]]]]
From 1714 onwards, about 52 [[Coastal artillery|batteries]] and [[redoubt]]s were built around the coasts of Malta and Gozo. A few of the batteries were built around existing coastal watchtowers, such as [[Qawra Tower|Qawra]] and [[Aħrax Tower]]s. Most of the batteries were destroyed over the years or are in ruins, but a few are still more or less intact, including [[Mistra Battery|Mistra]], [[Vendôme Battery|Vendôme]], [[Ferretti Battery|Ferretti]], [[Saint Anthony's Battery|St. Anthony's]], [[Qolla l-Bajda Battery|Qolla l-Bajda]] and [[Saint Mary's Battery|St. Mary's]] Batteries. Very few redoubts survive, including [[Briconet Redoubt|Briconet]], [[Ximenes Redoubt|Ximenes]] and [[Saint George Redoubt|St. George]] Redoubts. Various [[Entrenchment (fortification)|entrenchments]] were also built between the 1720s and 1760s, both around the coastline and along some inland positions. The remains of a few still survive today, including the [[Naxxar Entrenchment]] and the [[Louvier Entrenchment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=18th Century Hospitaller Coastal Batteries|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/18th-century-hospitaller-coastal-batteries.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=30 December 2014|date=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=ARX - Hospitaller Coastal Batteries|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/News/arx-hospitaller-coastal-batteries.html|website=militaryarchitecture.com|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1749 to the 1760s, [[Fort Chambray]] was built on the island of Gozo. It was intended to be a new fortified city like Valletta, and eventually to replace the [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]] as the island's capital. This was unsuccessful, and eventually only the fort was built. It saw some action during the French occupation of 1798, but its importance eventually diminished. It was converted into a hospital in the 19th century. In the 1990s, the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped, but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort Chambrai|url=http://www.visitgozo.com/en/item/sight-seeing-places-of-interest/fort-chambrai-1124/|website=Visit Gozo|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1793 and 1795, [[Fort San Lucian|Saint Lucian Tower]] and its battery were strengthened with a ditch and an entrenchment-like enclosure, and the complex was renamed Fort Rohan after the reigning Grand Master, [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]]. Most of the fortifications, with the exception of the tower itself, were dismantled and rebuilt by the British later on in the 19th century and the name Fort Rohan fell into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Lucian Fort|url=http://www.eh4-marenostrum.net/virtualtour/Marsaxlokk/trail_2/15/St-Lucian-Fort.pdf|website=Mare Nostrum|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the knights' fortifications, over the years various individuals or families built their own fortifications. These were mainly fortified residences or private watchtowers. A notable surviving example is [[Mamo Tower]], built in 1657 in Marsaskala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mamo Tower|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/00043.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French occupation (1798–1800)==
[[File:Tal-Borg Battery map.png|thumb|Map of [[Tal-Borg Battery]], one of the batteries built by Maltese insurgents]]

The French evicted the Order from Malta during the [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798]], and the Order surrendered after a couple of days. The Maltese, although initially welcoming the French occupiers, rebelled after a couple of months due to a number of reforms and the looting of churches. The [[National Congress Battalions|insurgents]] took control of Gozo which became [[Gozo (independent state)|briefly independent]], as well as [[Mdina]] and the towns and villages of the main island, leaving the French blockaded in the well-defended harbour area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sciberras|first1=Sandro|title=Maltese History - F.

The Maltese insurgents, helped by the British, hastily built various fortifications mainly intended to repel a possible French counter-attack, and at the same time also bombard French positions in the harbour area. The insurgents had various camps, and men in these camps were responsible for a number of batteries, redoubts and entrenchments in the vicinity. The most important batteries were the [[Corradino Batteries]], [[Għargħar Battery]], [[Tal-Borg Battery]] and [[Tas-Samra Battery]].&lt;ref name=batteries1798/&gt;

The fortifications surrounded the entire harbour area, stretching all the way from [[Sliema]] to [[Kalkara]]. The design of the batteries was based on the coastal batteries and entrenchments built by the Order in the 18th century, while most of the entrenchments consisted of long stretches of rubble walls. They were armed by guns taken from coastal fortifications such as [[Saint Mary's Tower]]. The usefulness of the fortifications was tested in 1799 when a French counter-attack from Fort Manoel was repelled by the insurgent batteries.&lt;ref name=batteries1798/&gt;

None of these fortifications survive intact, although some pre-existing buildings that were used as blockhouses may still be seen. [[San Rocco Battery]], one of the insurgents' fortifications, was the location where [[Fort Saint Rocco]] was built later on in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=batteries1798&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Maltese ‘siege’ batteries of the blockade 1798-1800|journal=Arx - Online Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification|date=May 2008|issue=6|pages=4-47|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/Arx/arx6-2008.pdf|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British fortifications (1800–1979)==
===Nineteenth and early twentieth centuries===
[[File:Malta - Valletta - Xatt Lascaris+SS Peter and Paul Bastion+custom house+Upper Barrakka Gardens (MSTHC) 01 ies.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lascaris Battery]] in [[Valletta]]]]

The British took over the Maltese islands as a [[Malta Protectorate|protectorate]] in 1800, and later as a [[Crown Colony of Malta|colony]] in 1813. They initially used the Hospitaller fortifications without any alterations. Under the military theory of the time, the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Mediterranean Fleet]] was regarded as the most reliable protection against invasion, and in fact the British [[List of Civil Commissioners of Malta|Civil Commissioner]], [[Henry Pigot]], wanted to demolish the majority of Valletta's fortifications in 1801, although this was never done.&lt;ref name=times-2012-11-18/&gt; During the British period, the various forts of the Order were rearmed, refitted and altered a number of times to keep up with the latest military technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=Maltese fortifications (6) - The British Period|journal=Civilization|date=1984|volume=1|pages=246-250|publisher=PEG Ltd|location=[[Ħamrun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1850s, the British built [[Fort Verdala]] and St. Clement's Retrenchment in the Cottonera area, while [[Lascaris Battery]] was built in Valletta. Later on in the 19th century, parts of the [[Cottonera Lines]], [[Santa Margherita Lines]] and the [[fortifications of Senglea]] were demolished to make way for extensions of the [[Malta Dockyard]]. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the British built barracks in various parts of the island, such as [[Tigné Point]] and [[Pembroke, Malta|Pembroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Tigné Point|url=http://www.midimalta.com/tigne-point-history|website=MIDI plc|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darmanin|first1=Denis|title=Pembroke: from war symbol to spacious modern town|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130915/life-features/Pembroke-from-war-symbol-to-spacious-modern-town.486446|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, Colonel [[William Jervois]] produced a report entitled &quot;Memorandum with reference to the improvements to the defences of Malta and Gibraltar, rendered necessary by the introduction of Iron Plated Ships and powerful rifled guns&quot;, in which he gave Malta (along with [[Gibraltar]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] and [[Bermuda]]) the status of an &quot;imperial fortress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rose|editor1-first=John Holland|editor2-last=Newton|editor2-first=Arthur Percival|editor3-last=Benians|editor3-first=Ernest Alfred|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Dodwell|editor4-first=Henry|title=The Cambridge History of the British Empire - Volume III|date=1959|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=232|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=Mu48AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A programme to improve Malta's fortifications began soon after, and a number of new [[polygonal fort]]s and batteries were built, including  [[Sliema Point Battery]] (1872), [[Fort St. Rocco]] (1872–73) and [[Fort Leonardo]] (1875–78).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Formosa|first1=Christian|title=Colonel Jervois Report of 1866|url=http://www.maltamilitary.0catch.com/html/jervois_report.html|website=Malta Military|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1871 to 1880, the [[Corradino Lines]] were built on the Corradino Heights. The V-shaped trace and ditch were meant to protect the dockyard and harbour from landward attacks. They were abandoned in the early 1900s due to advancements in technology, although they saw some use once again in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corradino Lines|url=http://schoolnet.gov.mt/history/wirt/Nglizi/Difiza/CorradLines.htm|website=schoolnet.gov.mt|accessdate=21 December 2014|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Forgotten WWII Post at Corradino|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/forgotten-wwii-post-at-corradino.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=30 December 2014|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victoria Lines Malta 1.jpg|thumb|[[Victoria Lines]] on the border between [[Mġarr]] and [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]]]]
Starting from 1875, the [[Victoria Lines]], originally known as the North West Front, were built along the northern part of Malta, dividing it from the more heavily populated south. The system of defences consisted of a line of fortifications flanked by defensive towers, along with entrenchments and gun emplacements. Several artillery batteries were planned, but only [[San Giovanni Battery]] and [[Tarġa Battery]] were actually built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=The Victoria Lines|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/the-victoria-lines.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three forts were also built along the lines: [[Fort Binġemma]], [[Fort Madalena]] and [[Fort Mosta]]. The lines were completed in 1899, but exercises in 1900 proved that they were of dubious defensive value, and the entire system was decommissioned in 1907, with the exception of the coastal towers. Today, parts of the lines have collapsed but other parts in the countryside, including the three forts, still survive. Another fort, [[Fort Pembroke]], was built between 1875 and 1878 to cover the gap between the Victoria Lines and the harbour area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria Lines Malta|url=http://www.victorialinesmalta.com/|website=victorialinesmalta.com|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The British also built a number of forts to protect [[Marsaxlokk]] Harbour. These included [[Fort San Lucian]] (1874–78), [[Fort Delimara]] (1876–88), [[Fort Tas-Silġ]] (1879–83). In 1881 and 1882, [[Saint Paul's Battery]] and [[Żonqor Battery]] were built in Marsaxlokk and Marsaskala respectively.&lt;ref name=stephenson2004/&gt;

[[File:Armstrong-Kanone Malta 0138.jpg|thumb|left|[[100-ton gun]] at [[Rinella Battery]]]]
Following the arming of the Italian ironclads ''[[Italian ironclad Caio Duilio|Duilio]]'' and ''[[Italian ironclad Enrico Dandolo|Dandolo]]'' with [[100-ton gun]]s, the British feared an Italian attack on Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, destroying them one after the other, while keeping outside their guns' range. To prevent this, the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and [[Cambridge Battery]] and [[Rinella Battery]] were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The gun at Rinella still exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Military Architecture of the 100-ton Gun Batteries|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Building-Methods/military-architecture-of-the-100-ton-gun-batteries.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=24 December 2014|date=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1888 to 1910, a new series of fortifications were built to house [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading guns]]. These were [[Della Grazie Battery]], [[Spinola Battery]], [[Garden Battery]], [[Wolseley Battery]], [[Pembroke Battery]] and [[Fort Benghisa]]. The latter was the last polygonal fort to be built in Malta.&lt;ref name=stephenson2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephenson|first1=Charles|title=The Fortifications of Malta 1530-1945|date=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1841766933|page=40–41|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=XsQ1CdqvyqUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wars and aftermath===
[[File:Malta - Naxxar - Triq is-Salina 06 ies.jpg|thumb|Reserve Post R15, a World War II-era pillbox in [[Naxxar]]]]

After the early 20th century, few fortifications were built in Malta. However, new military installations such as airfields began to be built in [[World War I]], when the seaplane base of [[RAF Kalafrana]] and the airfield at [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]] were built. More airfields were built in the interwar period and the Second World War, including [[RAF Hal Far]], [[RAF Ta' Kali]], [[RAF Luqa]], [[RAF Safi]], [[RAF Qrendi]] and [[Ta' Lambert Airfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malta|url=http://www.forgottenairfields.com/malta/|website=forgottenairfields.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Abyssinia Crisis|Abyssinian Crisis]] of 1935 onwards, the British built many [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] in Malta for defence in case of an Italian invasion. Many others were built during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guided tour of WWII defences|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20051205/local/guided-tour-of-wwii-defences.69984|accessdate=21 November 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=5 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many pillboxes still exist, especially on the north eastern part of the island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed as they are not considered to have any architectural or historic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wartime pillbox at Salina being pulled down|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-04-10/news/wartime-pillbox-at-salina-being-pulled-down-4577918976/|accessdate=21 November 2014|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fort Campbell 09.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Fort Campbell (Malta)|Fort Campbell]] in [[Mellieħa]]]]
The last fort to be built in Malta was [[Fort Campbell (Malta)|Fort Campbell]], which was built near [[Mellieħa]] between late 1937 and 1938. The design of the fort is completely different from the earlier fortifications in Malta as it was designed to counter the new threat of aerial bombardment. It had an irregular plan and its perimeter was guarded by machine gun posts and a few rifle loopholes. The buildings inside were scattered so as not to create a concentration of buildings. The fort still exists, although it is largely in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mifsud|first1=Simon|title=Fort Campbell|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/fort-campbell.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=30 December 2014|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Debono|first1=Charles|title=Fortifications - Fort Campbell (Selmun)|url=http://www.mellieha.com/places_interest/fortifications/fortcampbell.htm|website=Mellieha.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], the [[Lascaris War Rooms]] were built in Valletta to serve as the war headquarters for the defence of Malta. They were later used in the headquarters of the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lascaris War Rooms|url=http://www.lascariswarrooms.com/|publisher=Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the war, many [[air-raid shelter]]s also were dug in the limestone rock of the islands, either by the government or by individuals or families, to protect the civilian population of Malta from Italian or German aerial bombardment. Many of the shelters still exist, and a few are open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World War II shelters opened at Mellieha|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20040704/local/world-war-ii-shelters-opened-at-mellieha.118551|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=4 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cini|first1=George|title=Life inside a WWII shelter|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20050414/local/life-inside-a-wwii-shelter.93421|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=14 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many anti-aircraft batteries, gun positions and radar stations were also built throughout the course of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Agius|first1=Maurice|title=The Royal Malta Artillery’s role in the Battle for Malta|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130407/life-features/The-Royal-Malta-Artillery-s-role-in-the-Battle-for-Malta.464700|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of the fortifications were decommissioned between the 1950s and 1970s. Some were left abandoned while others were used for a variety of purposes, such as private residences, restaurants, police stations or farms. Some barracks, such as those at [[Mtarfa]] and [[Pembroke, Malta|Pembroke]], were converted to housing estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mtarfa|url=http://www.mydestination.com/malta/sights/157718/mtarfa|website=mydestination.com|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pembrokelc/&gt;

[[File:Malta Fortification Centre.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Fortifications Interpretation Centre]]]]

The [[Fortifications Interpretation Centre]] (FIC) is a public institution dedicated to communicating and exhibiting Malta's military architecture. It is located in a building adjoining Saint Andrew's Bastion, part of the city walls of Valletta. The building was originally a bombproof magazine and artillery school that was built sometime during the reign of [[Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle]] in the late 16th century. The uppermost floor had been destroyed in World War II and the rest of the building was subsequently used as an examination hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fortifications Information Centre|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/News/new-fortifications-information-centre-malta.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025041142/http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/News/new-fortifications-information-centre-malta.html|archivedate=25 October 2010|date=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was restored and the upper floor rebuilt in a project co-financed by the [[European Regional Development Fund]], and the FIC was opened on 16 February 2013.&lt;ref name=tom2013-02-03/&gt;

The FIC includes information guides on the fortifications of Malta, going back to the first fortifications at Borġ in-Nadur and focusing especially on those built by the Order and the British.&lt;ref name=tom2013-02-03&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galea|first1=Carmel|title=The Fortifications Interpretation Centre|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130203/letters/The-Fortifications-Interpretation-Centre.456022|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=3 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042103/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130203/letters/The-Fortifications-Interpretation-Centre.456022|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains models of Maltese forts, as well as informative panels describing fortifications around the world, thus putting Malta's fortifications in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Di Puccio|first1=Francesca|title=The Fortifications Interpretation Centre: a must-visit in Valletta|url=http://www.maltainsideout.com/24307/fortifications-interpretation-centre/|website=Malta Inside Out|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404105625/http://www.maltainsideout.com/24307/fortifications-interpretation-centre/|archivedate=4 April 2016|date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
