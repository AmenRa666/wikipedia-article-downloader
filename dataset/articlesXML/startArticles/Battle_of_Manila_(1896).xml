The '''Battle of Manila of 1896''' occurred in [[Manila]] in then Spanish colony of the [[Philippines]] during the [[Philippine Revolution]]. [[Katipunan]] under [[Andres Bonifacio]] attempted to take the city but the attempt failed, and Bonifacio retreated to the city's outskirts. The [[Battle of San Juan del Monte]] was joined a day later when Bonifacio attempted to capture the San Juan's [[Gunpowder magazine|powder magazine]], but this too failed.

== Bonifacio's plan ==
Since the start of the revolution, the city of Manila, and specifically its walled center [[Intramuros]], was the primary target of ''El Supremo'' Andres Bonifacio and his Katipuneros.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  The take over of Intramuros had been a logical move for any uprising trying to overthrow the Spanish colonial regime in the Philippines. In this area were the ''Ayuntamiento'' (City Hall), ''Intendencia'', and ''Palacio Arzobispal'' (Archbishop's Palace). The seat of the [[Governor-General]] was in [[Malacañang Palace]], 300 paces from Intramuros. Very few Spanish troops guarded the city, as most were garrisoned around the archipelago. Bonifacio thought that once the city is taken the revolutionaries would be welcomed by the inhabitants, whom he thought are already sick of Spanish domination.

Bonifacio intended to take the city by force&lt;ref name=stories&gt;{{cite book|last=Bascara|first=Cornelio|title=Stories from the Margins|year=2002|publisher=UST Publishing House|pages=143–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a three-pronged attack.&lt;ref name=Alvarez&gt;Alvarez, S.V., 1992, Recalling the Revolution, Madison: Center for Southeast Asia Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison, ISBN 1-881261-05-0&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}}  The forces of General Aguedo del Rosario would come from [[Tondo, Manila]], those of General Vicente Fernandez from San Marcelino{{clarify|date=May 2015|reason=this does not refer to San Marcelino (in Zamboanga, which has a WP article); it needs more clarity about what it does refer to}}, and those of General Ramon Bernardo through the Rotonda in [[Sampaloc, Manila]].&lt;ref name=stories /&gt; General Fernandez was to take over ''La Electricista de Manila'' (Manila electric plant) in Quiapo and cut the electrical supply to Manila, which would be the signal for the others to attack. Once Manila was thrown to darkness, the plan was to lure the Spanish troops from Intramuros towards vital water installations in Rotonda in Sampaloc, ''El Deposito'' in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan del Monte]], the Balara filter station, and the [[Marikina]] main water supply. These installations were threatened to be sabotaged by the Katipunan revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=stories /&gt; The Spanish troops would be engaged by General Bernardo forces. Forces in Cavite under [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], together with those under General del Rosario, would then attack Intramuros which would be lacking troops for defense. These forces attacking Intramuros would be helped by revolutionaries that infiltrated into Regiment 70 (''Regimiento de Magallanes numero 70''), the only regiment concentrated for the defense of Manila as well as the rest of Luzon. The regiment numbered around 2,300 troops in Manila, of which more than 85% were composed of native integrees.&lt;ref name=stories /&gt; Also according to plan, the Katipuneros would be spreading false news to create confusion among the Manila population. Rumors would include a Japanese take over of Manila, or the Japanese ordering the native revolutionaries to occupy Manila for them.&lt;ref name=stories /&gt;

== Battle ==
Before the plan was to be put to action one Katipunan member Teodoro Patiño, known for his talkativeness, revealed the existence of the revolutionary organization to a Spanish priest named Mariano Gil, who then reported it to the local authorities as revenge for grave misunderstandings with fellow ''Katipunero'' Apolonio de la Cruz. As a result, the Spanish troops were warned of the attack and forced the Katipunan from the city. Protracted warfare soon escalated, with the battles of [[Battle of Pasong Tamo|Pasong Tamo]] (August 28–29, 1896) and of [[Battle of San Juan del Monte|San Juan del Monte]] (August 30, 1896).

Overall, the attack on Manila did not take place as Bonifacio planned. General Fernandez failed to launch the signal from the electric plant. The Katipuneros did not even reach the plant. Without the signal to coordinate the attack, the revolutionaries in Manila and Cavite went on their own battles. Despite this lack of coordination and contact among forces, Bonifacio commanding some 800 (or according to the Spanish, 300) still led the attack on Manila. His force was repulsed after the [[Battle of San Juan del Monte]].&lt;ref name=stories /&gt;

Following Bonifacio's failed attempt in San Juan, Katipuneros in the area, particularly in the towns of [[Pasig City|Pasig]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]], [[Taguig|Tagig]], [[Caloocan|Kalookan]], [[Makati|San Pedro de Macati]] and [[Mandaluyong]] began simultaneous attacks on Spanish installments.&lt;ref name=&quot;malacanang&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/map-1-1896-for-web.jpg |title=Image: map-1-1896-for-web.jpg, (2400 × 2789 px) |publisher=malacanang.gov.ph |accessdate=2015-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033124/http://malacanang.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/map-1-1896-for-web.jpg |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of these attacks failed due to the Katipuneros' lack of arms. The most successful uprising was led by the Pasig Katipuneros under Valentin Cruz. On Saturday, August 29, some 2,000 Pasiguenos met at the border of barrios Maybunga and Caniogan, marched towards the plaza, and took over the headquarters of the [[Guardia Civil]] and the municipal hall. This event is now commemorated as &quot;''Nagsabado sa Pasig''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;roquebutuyan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/http://www.roquebutuyan.com/mypigafetta/history3.html|title=History of Pasig|author=M Reyes Roque|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable uprisings occurred outside of Manila in the eight surrounding provinces of [[Cavite]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Bulacan]], [[Province of Manila]], [[Tarlac]], [[Pampanga]], [[Batangas]] and [[Nueva Ecija]]. The eight rays on the Philippine flag represent these first 8 provinces, put under Martial law by Governor-General Ramon Blanco.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Aftermath ==
Bonifacio had sparked an uprising bigger than any other previous uprising in the Tagalog-Pampango provinces.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} His &quot;Revolt of the Masses&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=sCxwAAAAMAAJ |title=A question of heroes}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired more Filipinos to begin their struggle for freedom from Spain. This revolt in Manila, though only lasting a week before Bonifacio and his men were reduced to guerilla warfare, led to the arrests and executions of thousands of upper-class Filipinos who were suspected of having Katipunan ties.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Bagumbayan, now known as [[Luneta]], became a killing field, culminating in the execution of [[José Rizal]] at the park in December, 1896.

Emilio Aguinaldo would use the same plan when revolutionary forces surrounded Manila from four fronts in June 1898 during the [[Spanish–American War]]. This planned attack also did not take place, due to the takeover of Manila by the Americans during the [[Battle of Manila (1898)|Battle of Manila of 1898]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Manila, My Manila&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Joaquin, Nick|title=Manila, My Manila|publisher=Vera-Reyes, Inc.|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
