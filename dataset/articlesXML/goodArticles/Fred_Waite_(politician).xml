'''Fred Waite''', {{post-nominals|country=NZL|size=100%|sep=,|CMG|DSO|OBE|VD}} (21 August 1885 – 29 August 1952) was a New Zealand farmer, historian, politician, and soldier who served in both the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World War]]s.

Born in [[Dunedin]], Waite was a farmer at the outbreak of the First World War. He joined the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] (NZEF) and served in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], during which he received the [[Distinguished Service Order]]. He was evacuated from Gallipoli due to sickness and repatriated to New Zealand, where he saw out the war as an instructor in NZEF training camps. He wrote a [[Official History of New Zealand's Effort in the Great War|history of New Zealand's military efforts during the Gallipoli Campaign]] that was published in 1919. He returned to his farm and soon became involved in politics, joining the [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]]. In 1925 he was elected Member of Parliament for the [[Clutha (New Zealand electorate)|Clutha electorate]], serving two terms.  He was appointed to the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] in 1934. During the Second World War, Waite was overseas commissioner for the National Patriotic Fund Board and was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for his services in this role. Two years later he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]]. He died in 1952 at the age of 67.

==Early life==
Waite was born in [[Dunedin]] on 21 August 1885, one of eight children of George Waite, a storekeeper, and his wife.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{DNZB|Green|David|4w1|Waite, Fred 1885–1952|25 November 2013||}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving [[Mornington, Otago|Mornington]] School,&lt;ref name=&quot;new member bio&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The New Members |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19251105.2.89.36 |accessdate=25 November 2013 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |date=5 November 1925 |volume=CX |issue=110 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; he worked for the regional newspaper, the ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'', and for the ''[[Otago Witness]]''.&lt;ref name=Green /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;new member bio&quot; /&gt; He was a [[Typesetting|typesetter]] when he married Ada Taylor in 1912 but the following year took up farming near [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]].&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; He was interested in the military and was a member of an engineers unit in the Volunteer Force, which was later re-organised into the [[Territorial Force (New Zealand)|Territorial Force]] (TF).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODT&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=ODT19100317.2.20 | title=Dunedin Engineers | date=17 March 1910 | newspaper=[[Otago Daily Times]] | accessdate=3 December 2013 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Waite volunteered for the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] (NZEF) that was being raised for service overseas. He also undertook to send dispatches from the front for his previous employer, the ''Otago Witness'', but this work proved short-lived when he became a censor as part of his military duties.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=573}} He was posted as a [[lieutenant]] in the New Zealand Engineers and sailed with the main body of the NZEF to the Middle East in October 1914.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;

Promoted to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]], Waite participated in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. In early May 1915, he restored order amongst personnel of the Otago Infantry Battalion following a failed attack on Turkish positions.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29180|date=1 June 1915|startpage=5331|endpage= |supp=y|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the citation reading: ''&quot;For gallantry and devotion to duty in connection with the operations at the Dardanelles (Mediterranean Expeditionary Force). On the night of 2-3 May 1915 during the operations in the neighbourhood of Gape Tepe for gallantry and resource in rallying his men, and leading them forward at critical moments&quot;.''{{sfn|Haigh|Polaschek|1993|p=268}}

Later in the campaign Waite served as the [[adjutant]] of the New Zealand Engineers and was twice [[mentioned in dispatches]]. Evacuated to England with [[dysentery]],{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=573}} he was repatriated to New Zealand in 1916. His service with the NZEF ceased and he returned to the TF in his pre-war rank of [[major]].  He took up an appointment as Chief Engineer Instructor of the NZEF training camps.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=573}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominion&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=DOM19170602.2.76  | title=Territorial Arm – appointments | date=2 June 1917 | newspaper= Dominion | accessdate=3 December 2013 | page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the end of the war, Waite wrote a brief account of New Zealand's contributions to the Gallipoli Campaign. Authorities invited him to prepare a more substantial work and this resulted in the [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WaiNewZ.html ''The New Zealanders at Gallipoli''], the first volume in a series of the ''[[Official History of New Zealand's Effort in the Great War]]'', published in 1919. Two years later it was republished as a revised edition. Waite also worked on the production of the three other volumes in the series, which were published around the same time.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=573}}

==Interwar period==
After the war, Waite returned to his Balclutha property which he converted to [[dairy farming]].&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; He remained a member of the TF for several years and was a major in the Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment before being promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] and becoming its commander from 1927 to 1930.{{sfn|Haigh|Polaschek|1993|p=268}} For his prolonged service with the TF, he eventually received the [[Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration]]. In 1935 he was awarded the [[King George V Silver Jubilee Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EP&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19350506.2.12  | title=Official jubilee medals | date=6 May 1935 | newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] | accessdate=2 July 2013 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already involved in the dairying industry, he began to participate in the governance of the sector and set up the Co-Operative Dairy Company of Otago. He later joined the New Zealand Farmer's Union and was president of its Otago Branch.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;

As well as his work in the dairying sector, Waite soon became involved in local politics and joined the [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]].&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; He first stood for election to the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in {{NZ election link year|1925}}, when he defeated the incumbent in the {{NZ electorate link|Clutha}} electorate, [[John Edie (New Zealand politician)|John Edie]] of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], with ease.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=145}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reform Triumph |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NA19251105.2.46 |accessdate=25 November 2013 |newspaper=[[The Northern Advocate]] |date=5 November 1925 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of 13 new members in a House of 80 representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Members |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=OSWCC19251110.2.43 |accessdate=26 November 2013 |newspaper=Otautau Standard and Wallace County Chronicle |volume=XXI |issue=1055 |date=10 November 1925 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the {{NZ election link|1928}}, he was challenged by Joseph Stephens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Labour's Candidates |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=MW19221122.2.11 |accessdate=26 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Maoriland Worker]] |date=22 November 1922 |volume=12 |issue=299 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was an [[Independent politician|independent]] candidate describing himself as [[Liberal-Labour (New Zealand)|Liberal-Labour]]. Waite had a 523-vote margin, which represented 6.5% of the valid votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The General Election, 1928 |year=1929 |publisher=Government Printer |url= http://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AJHR1929-I.2.3.2.37 |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the {{NZ election link|1931}}, Waite was defeated by [[Peter McSkimming]], who stood as an Independent, but had links to the [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=145}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Elections Recounts |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19311212.2.81 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |date=12 December 1931 |volume=CXII |issue=142 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]] had not made appointments to the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] since 1930, with the exception of [[James Parr (politician)|James Parr]] in 1931, and membership dwindled during the years of the [[Great Depression]]. By 1934, the membership had reduced to 19, the lowest since 1860, with two members about to retire. In 1934, 14 new members were appointed by Forbes, including Waite.{{sfn|Jackson|1972|p=68}} All appointments became effective on 22 June 1934,{{sfn|Wilson|1985|pp=148–166}} and Waite, at age 49, was the second youngest of the intake; only [[Vincent Ward (politician)|Vincent Ward]] was younger.{{sfn|Jackson|1972|p=230}} Waite was reappointed twice, and served until the [[Suicide squad (New Zealand)|abolition of the Upper House]] in 1950.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=166}}

When the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] was formed in 1936 from the merger of Reform and the [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]], publicity was one of the major considerations. The party's provisional council established a sub-committee consisting of [[Henry Livingstone]], [[Frederick Doidge]], and Waite. This committee reported back in February 1937, recommending the establishment of a Dominion publicity committee, and a trustee company for the purpose of publishing a party newsletter. Party Publications Ltd was thus created, and Waite was the first editor of ''The National News''. Initially, all financial members were to receive this monthly newsletter, aimed at being a counterpart to [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]'s ''Standard''.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=195}} While ''The National News'' performed an important function during the party's formative years, the venture was expensive and following the {{NZ election link|1938}}, it was changed to a quarterly schedule, before being discontinued in September 1939 just after the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=196}}

The seven-member Dominion publicity committee, of which Waite was a member, engaged three advertising companies to jointly prepare for the 1938 election. Two of those companies, John Ilott and Charles Haines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Jock |title=Advertising – Advertising agencies, 1891–1970 |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/advertising/page-2 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=26 January 2014 |authorlink=Jock Phillips |date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; remained joint agents for the National Party until 1973.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=196}}

==Second World War==
[[File:LC Waite with Prime Minister Fraser, 1941.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant Colonel Waite (far right) with Prime Minister [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]] (in white suit), visiting the Infantry Training Depot at Maadi Camp in Egypt, May 1941]]
When the [[Second World War]] began, Waite was still a lieutenant colonel in the TF. He was appointed overseas commissioner for the National Patriotic Fund Board. Based in Egypt, he worked to provide the soldiers of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force with special supplies and treats.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; His services in this capacity were recognised in 1944 with his appointment as an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36493 |date=2 May 1944 |startpage=2005 |supp=yes |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the war a [[colonel]], working in Europe on the repatriation of New Zealand personnel recently released from prisoner-of-war camps in Germany. In 1946, he travelled to Japan to inspect the infrastructure set up for [[J Force|J-Force]], New Zealand's contribution to the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]], following which he retired from the military. In the [[1946 Birthday Honours|1946 King's Birthday Honours]], he was appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]].&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 37601 |date=4 June 1946 |startpage=2835 |supp=yes |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In his retirement, Waite wrote papers on archeology and history including one on Egyptian pottery. While in [[Cairo]] during the Second World War, he collected several historical antiquities on behalf of the [[Otago Museum]].&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; In 1951 Waite was granted the right to retain the title of &quot;Honourable&quot;, having served more than 10 years as a member of the Legislative Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=39156 |date=23 February 1951 |startpage=977 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, his health was poor and he died in Balclutha in 1952 at the age of 67. He was survived by his wife and a daughter.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;
