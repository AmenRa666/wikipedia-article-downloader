The '''57th/60th Battalion''' was an [[infantry]] [[battalion]] of the [[Australian Army]] which served during the [[Second World War]]. It was formed in 1930 as part of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] by the amalgamation of the [[57th Battalion (Australia)|57th]] and [[60th Battalion (Australia)|60th Battalions]] and was assigned to the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th Brigade]], [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. Following the outbreak of the war, the battalion was initially used in a garrison role in Australia before being deployed to [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] in 1943, remaining there for almost 18 months before being brought back to Australia. Later, in mid April 1945 the battalion embarked for [[Bougainville campaign|Bougainville]] where they took part in the advance towards [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]] in the southern sector of the island. Following the end of hostilities the battalion was disbanded in March 1946.

==History==
The battalion was formed in 1930 by the amalgamation of two previously existing units of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]], the [[57th Battalion (Australia)|57th]] and [[60th Battalion (Australia)|60th Battalions]].&lt;ref name=Box35&gt;Box (1995), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corfield (1991), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic privations of the [[Great Depression]] and the end of the [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory training scheme]] had resulted in a reduction in the size of Australia's military forces and as a result there was a need to rationalise the number of active units.&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo (2001), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon amalgamation the battalion adopted the territorial title of the &quot;Merri/Heidelberg Regiment&quot; and they were assigned to the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th Brigade]], [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]].&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11332.asp|title=57th/60th Battalion|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo (2002), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outset of the [[Second World War]], due to the provisions of the ''Defence Act (1903)'' which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory,&lt;ref name=Johnston5&gt;Johnston (2007), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|This stipulation also applied to the 2,800 strong Permanent Military Force.&lt;ref name=Johnston5/&gt;|group=Note}}{{#tag:ref|Of the 32 Militia battalions that saw active service during the war, all but three were given AIF status. Essentially this meant that as more than 65 per cent of their wartime establishment had volunteered for service overseas, the battalion could be sent anywhere, including outside of Australian territory. The 57th/60th Battalion was one of the 29 battalions to receive this status.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston (2007), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} the decision was made to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly the United Kingdom—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training.&lt;ref&gt;Grey (2008), pp. 145–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the battalion conducted a number of training camps during 1940 and into 1941 at [[Mount Martha, Victoria|Mount Martha]] before moving to [[Seymour, Victoria|Seymour]] in early 1942.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; With the entry of Japan into the war and the potential threat that this posed to the Australian mainland the Militia were called up for full-time service to undertake defensive duties on the mainland and in the Australian territory of New Guinea. A few months later in March the battalion, along with the rest of the 15th Brigade was relocated to New South Wales where they were given the task of defending the [[Tweed Valley]] in case of Japanese invasion.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; Late in the year the 15th Brigade was released from this task and sent north to [[Caboolture, Queensland]], where they began training for deployment to New Guinea.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

The 57th/60th Battalion arrived in [[Port Moresby]] in March 1943. After this, while the rest of the brigade took part in the [[Salamaua–Lae campaign|fighting around Lae and Salamaua]], the battalion undertook defensive duties around the American airbase at [[Tsili Tsili|Tsilli Tsilli]].&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bradley184&gt;Bradley (2004), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the successful completion of the Salamaua–Lae campaign in September 1943 the battalion moved back to Port Moresby where it remained until early in 1944 when the 15th Brigade was detached from the 3rd Division and placed under the command of the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] for its campaign in the [[Finisterre Range campaign|Markham and Ramu valleys]], arriving at Dumpu on 7 January.&lt;ref name=Bradley184/&gt; In February, after fighting around the Kankiryo Saddle, the 15th Brigade moved up the Faria Valley to take over from the [[18th Brigade (Australia)|18th Brigade]] and the 57th/60th Battalion relieved the [[2/9th Battalion (Australia)|2/9th Battalion]] on the western side of the saddle.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2004), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade then proceeded to advance towards [[Madang]]. Moving along the Bogadjim road, the battalion mounted a [[Company (military unit)|company]] attack on a Japanese position on the high ground overlooking Bogadjim near Bau-ak on 10 April; three days later they occupied the village.&lt;ref&gt;Maitland (1999), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the 57th/60th continued the advance towards the coast and on 24 April 1944, a patrol from the battalion was the first Allied unit to reach Madang.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

In August, after almost 18 months abroad, the battalion was withdrawn back to Australia for rest and reorganisation on the [[Atherton Tablelands]] in Queensland.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; At this time the battalion had an authorised strength of 803 personnel&lt;ref name=Palazzo2003_6/&gt; and was organised into five companies: one headquarters company and four rifle companies (designated 'A' to 'D'). Headquarters company consisted of six [[platoon]]s, numbered 1 to 6, fulfilling different support functions including signals, mortar, medium machine-gun fire support, anti-tank, pioneer and transport. Each of the rifle companies consisted of three platoons, numbered consecutively throughout the battalion from 7 Platoon to 18 Platoon.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield (1991), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; Their stay in Australia proved short for the 15th Brigade as in April 1945 they received orders to rejoin the 3rd Division which was at the time on [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]] as part of the [[Australian II Corps|II Corps]];&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; the Australians having taken over responsibility for the island from the Americans in November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Long (1963), pp. 92–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Battle of Slater's Knoll|fighting around Slater's Knoll]] the 15th Brigade moved forward and relieved the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]] in the southern sector of the island and shortly afterwards resumed the advance along the axis of the Buin Road, crossing the [[Hongorai River|Hongorai]], Hari and Mobiai rivers before being relieved on 1 July by the [[29th Brigade (Australia)|29th Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;Maitland (1999), pp. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time the 57th/60th took part in the [[Battle of the Hongorai River]], as well as the advance to the Mivo, undertaking a diversionary drive along the Commando Road on the left flank of the brigade's main effort.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

Following the brigade's relief in July, the battalion did not see combat again before the war came to an end. After this the [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II|demobilisation process]] began and the battalion's numbers slowly decreased. In December 1945, the battalion returned to Australia, arriving in [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]] and moving to [[Chermside, Queensland|Chermside]] where on 30 March 1946 the battalion was disbanded.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; During the battalion's active service in New Guinea and Bougainville it lost 58 men killed in action or died of other causes,&lt;ref name=Box35/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corfield (1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and 134 men wounded.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], eight [[Military Cross|MCs]], one [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCM]], 14 [[Military Medal|MMs]], 24 [[Mentioned in Despatches|MIDs]] and two [[Efficiency Decoration|EDs]].&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;{{#tag:ref|This list differs slightly from that provided by the battalion historian, who lists one DSO, eight MCs, one DCM, 14 MMs, 24 MIDs and one ED.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield (1991), p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}
