== Problems Test Coordinates ==

There seem to be some problems with the Coordinates given for some of the nuclear tests at Maralinga.

Kite - 28.89° S 131.648° E, These coordinates put this site 110 Km due north of the One Tree and Marcoo tests. The area does not seem to have been disturbed, there are no signs of any monitoring stations or roads as found to the south. The lattitude may be a degree off. The original referenced source confirms these coordinates but I think corroboration is needed.

[Fixed] Breakaway - 29.895° S 29.895° E, These coordinates are a typo. They place the test in South Africa!!
The original referenced source gives this longitude 131.604 E

I recommend viewing these locations in Google earth. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:60.240.68.30|60.240.68.30]] ([[User talk:60.240.68.30|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/60.240.68.30|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:Well spotted!

:Regarding Kite, I think that one of the Patterson documents (possibly the conference presentation) includes a map of the site with test locations highlighted. How does this compare with the coords? [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 11:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)


Thanks, I've had a look around and found this: http://www.mapw.org.au/conferences/mapw2000/papers/parkinson.html

This might be the conference paper you were thinking of. It has maps of the test sites and puts the kite test much closer to the others. I'll try to work them out on google earth and then post them here. 

The Map matches the road patterns and confirms the &quot;good&quot; site coordinate we have already. It places the Kite test on the road, south west from the One-Tree test. The Coordinates for the site are close to  29°52'52.88&quot;S, 131°39'10.10&quot;E, If I have done my maths right this link should match those coordinates. ({{coor d|29.88|S|131.652|E}})

A more exact location would be better before we change the main page. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:60.240.68.30|60.240.68.30]] ([[User talk:60.240.68.30|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/60.240.68.30|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:Thank you, yes, that's the paper I meant. How embarrassing that I got the name of the author wrong!

:I feel ''very'' uncomfortable about changing the article. [[WP:NOR|Original research]] is prohibited by Wikipedia policy. I think that we need to find a source giving the correct location instead. As a last resort, I imagine that the Royal Commission's report ought to include it. I'd check myself, but only a paper copy seems to exist, and NSW is a long way for me to travel! [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 16:23, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

I could look that up. I live an hour south of Sydney. I'm a little busy in the next few days but I'll look into it. Have you any specific information about the royal commision report and where it is? ([[User:Mckinlayr|Mckinlayr]] 08:42, 9 November 2006 (UTC))

:According to the NAA's [http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/AgencyDetail.asp?M=0&amp;B=CA+3993 CA 3993] record (&quot;Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia During the 1950s and 1960s&quot;), the documents are held at head office in NSW. That would be: 120 Miller Road, CHESTER HILL, NSW 2162, Tel: (02) 9645 0110, Fax: (02) 9645 0108. (Having said that, other records indicate that they might be in Canberra. Probably best to check. I think you need to order the documents in advance anyway.) [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 11:26, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

Parkinson takes his map of the sites from page 9 this article: http://www.arpansa.gov.au/pubs/TECHREPT/arl070_pt1.pdf

The second half of the article and references are in a seperate file: http://www.arpansa.gov.au/pubs/TECHREPT/arl070_pt2.pdf

You can find both files under 1985 on http://www.arpansa.gov.au/techrpt.htm

It includes a scale on the map and marks out key features. The map may have been made from on ground measurements by the author, I can't find a specific reference for it. I guess the only way would be to search through each reference individually. ([[User:Mckinlayr|Mckinlayr]] 10:02, 9 November 2006 (UTC))

This document from the has a map of the site on page 28 : http://www.arpansa.gov.au/pubs/TECHREPT/arl005.pdf
I guess now I just have to look for common entries in the references of both papers and perhaps find the right data. ([[User:Mckinlayr|Mckinlayr]] 10:27, 9 November 2006 (UTC))

Last for tonight, Chapter 1 of this report contains new maps of the site. http://www.radioactivewaste.gov.au/publications/maralinga.htm

Oddly, the relative positions of the Kite and Tadje seem to have shifted in this newer map, in the older maps Tadje was to the south west of kite along the road. In this document Kite is shown to be east of the road and directly in line with Tadje. Perhaps these were from different surveys or maybe errors in either document. ([[User:Mckinlayr|Mckinlayr]] 10:54, 9 November 2006 (UTC))
:Nice work. Interesting observation about the relative positions. I should think that this isn't a major problem, as long as we cite what source we use and, ideally, mention the differences in a footnote. I'd be inclined to trust the Royal Commission's data, since they were able to get the UK gov't to supply the original information, and didn't have to rely upon guesswork.

== GA on hold ==
A good start, but there are some irregularities to be ironed out and some skinny parts need reinforcing.

*The years of usage isn’t mentioned in the lead which is rather strange. The Royal Commission is also not mentioned which is unusual and victims’ rights campaigning isn’t mentioned which is unusual
*Date format is not consistent, “October 3” and then “15 October” 
*I don’t think the alleged impact of the tests on aborigines should be in the historical context. It should be in the aftermath type sections
*Having a big blockquote as the first thing in the paragraph seems rather POV, in that it headlines the section with emotive POV
*Royal Commision is mentioned in the major test section but the name of the RC is not mentioned. Some paras are short and should be integrated
*What is Dr Roff’s full name and what is his field of research? It could be physics, military history or something else
*Need the events peceding the royal commission. Were their protests and lobbying before it? There should be a bit m,ore about Aboriginal issues in the aftermath section. There also needs to be more about the protest and compensation campaign I think.
*More info about the compensation campaign and the actual duties of the guinea pigs shouldbe included imho. 
Apart from that the POV/RS/COPYVIO stuff is all fine. '''[[User:Blnguyen|&lt;font color=&quot;GoldenRod&quot;&gt;Blnguyen&lt;/font&gt;]]'''  (''[[User talk:Blnguyen|&lt;font color=&quot;#FA8605&quot;&gt;bananabucket&lt;/font&gt;]]'') 00:16, 1 November 2007 (UTC)

What is the dark round feature, about 2km diameter, on google earth at 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 03'34&quot; S, 129&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;21'30&quot;? Can anyone upload a google earth image of a nuclear test site?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Danielj79|Danielj79]] ([[User talk:Danielj79|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Danielj79|contribs]]) 23:42, 21 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

It looks like a different soil type or possibly  different vegetation   There is another one about  8km east.  It is nothing to do with  the Maralinga tests which were about 250 km further East.

== &quot;Major&quot; tests ==

I have a concern with this terminology
*Sounds subjective
*Does &quot;major&quot; refer to the size of the explosion, or the effort that went into preparing the test?  If the size of the explosion, then 1KT is actually small by nuclear stds, making this description inaccurate.
&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Socrates2008&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;font size=2&gt;[[User talk:Socrates2008|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 08:48, 2 March 2012 (UTC)

:They (the British reports to the Australians) differentiate major tests (actual device explosion) to minor tests (Rats, Tims, Vixen: safety tests, dispersion tests, initiator development) which involve only conventional explosives. It's historical. [[User:SkoreKeep|SkoreKeep]] ([[User talk:SkoreKeep|talk]]) 02:21, 16 May 2014 (UTC)

==The table on this page is generated by database==

The table on this page and the contents of any nuclear tests infobox are generated from a database of nuclear testing which I have maintained and researched for a number of years. The table is automatically generated from that database by a Visual Basic script, and then has, periodically, been inserted into the page manually. I began doing this in October of 2013.

Recently a user complained (politely) to me about the practice.  It seems to him that it removes control from all editors besides myself over the content.  He believes it is tantamount to WP:OWNED of the pages affected.  He also points out that there is no public mention of the fact anywhere on wikipedia, and that is true, through my own oversight, until now.

There was no intent that the pages affected should be owned by myself; in fact, one of my reasons for building these pages was to solicit (in the wikipedia way) criticism and corrections to the data, perhaps additional references that I had been unable to locate. I have regenerated the tables twice in the days since they were originally placed.  Each time I did so, I performed a diff between the current version and the version that I put up in the previous cycle; all corrections were then either entered into the database or corrected in the programming, as appropriate.  As may be guessed, the programming corrections were frequent to start out as suggestions about the table formatting were raised, and most incorporated. I have not made judgements on the &quot;usefulness&quot; of corrections; all have been incorporated, or I have communicated directly with the editor to settle the matter.  In fact it was in pursuing such a correction that this matter came up.

I am posting this comment on the Talk page of every page containing content which is so generated. If you would like to comment on this matter, please go to the copy on [[Talk:List of nuclear tests]] so the discussion can be kept together.  I will also be placing a maintained template on each Talk page (if anyone would like also to be named as a maintainer on one or all pages, you are welcome). I solicit all comments and suggestions.

== Maralinga Prohibited Area ==

With regard to Maralinga being part of the Woomera Prohibited Area.  The book Fire Across the Desert was commissioned by the Government to document the history of the Anglo Australian Joint Project 1946 to 1980.  Although it doesn't discuss Maralinga in great detail it does state at page 224; &quot;much closer to the transcontinental railway line at Watson and in a seperate prohibited area, was Maralinga&quot; and &quot;The atomic tests were not conducted under the joint project but under a seperate agreement.  The distinction, particularly before  the foundation of Maralinga permanent test range, was in practice a hazy one.&quot;
The boundary of the Woomera Prohibited Area has been changed a number of times during its history and in each instance the amendment was published in the Commonwealth Gazette and a &quot;Plan&quot; of the area deposited with the South Australian State Lands Department. Some of these &quot;Plans&quot; dependant on their date show the Maralinga Prohibited Area and the Woomera Prohibited Area to be seperate but adjoining Prohibited Areas.
The file 62/5430 Extension of Aboriginal Reserves in the Maralinga Proibited Area was raised in August 1962 and it contains two drawings detailing that there are two distinct Prohibited Areas.  This file is available to the public on the National Archives of Australia website.
The last of the Maralinga Prohibited Area known as Section 400 has recently been handed back to the traditional owners of the area.  The boundary of the Woomera Prohibited Area in this region was unclear as in a number of publications it appears to divide Section 400 into two areas (approximately two thirds north and one third south)of the east west boundary.  I would suggest that the &quot;Plan&quot; deposited with the South Australian State Lands Department would need to be viewed to determine the location of the boundary and when it was changed.
