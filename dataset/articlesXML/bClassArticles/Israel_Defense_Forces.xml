The '''Israel Defense Forces''' ('''IDF'''; {{lang-he-n|צְבָא הַהֲגָנָה לְיִשְׂרָאֵל}} {{Audio|He-Israeli Defense Forces.ogg|''Tsva ha-Hagana le-Yisra'el''|help=no}}, ''lit.'' &quot;The Army of Defense for Israel&quot;; {{lang-ar|جيش الدفاع الإسرائيلي}}), commonly known in Israel by the Hebrew [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] ''Tzahal'' ({{Hebrew|צה״ל}}), are the military forces of the State of [[Israel]]. They consist of the [[GOC Army Headquarters|ground forces]], [[Israeli Air Force|air force]], and [[Israeli navy|navy]]. It is the sole military wing of the [[Israeli security forces]], and has no civilian jurisdiction within Israel. The IDF is headed by its [[Ramatkal|Chief of General Staff]], the ''Ramatkal'', subordinate to the [[Defense Minister of Israel]]; [[Lieutenant general]] (''[[Rav Aluf]]'') [[Gadi Eizenkot]] has served as Chief of Staff since 2015.

An order from Defense Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] on 26 May 1948 officially set up the Israel Defense Forces as a [[Conscription|conscript army]] formed out of the paramilitary group [[Haganah]], incorporating the [[militant (word)|militant]] groups [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]. The IDF served as Israel's armed forces in all the country's major military operations—including the [[1948 War of Independence]], [[Retribution operations|1951–1956 Retribution operations]], [[Suez Crisis|1956 Sinai War]], [[War over Water (Jordan river)|1964–1967 War over Water]], [[Six-Day War|1967 Six-Day War]], [[War of Attrition|1967–1970 War of Attrition]], [[Battle of Karameh|1968 Battle of Karameh]], [[1973 Israeli raid on Lebanon|1973 Operation Spring of Youth]], [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], [[Operation Entebbe|1976 Operation Entebbe]], [[Operation Litani|1978 Operation Litani]], [[1982 Lebanon War]], [[South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)|1982–2000 South Lebanon conflict]], [[First Intifada|1987–1993 First Intifada]], [[Second Intifada|2000–2005 Second Intifada]], [[Operation Defensive Shield|2002 Operation Defensive Shield]], [[2006 Lebanon War]], [[Gaza War (2008–09)|2008–2009 Operation Cast Lead]], [[Operation Pillar of Defense|2012 Operation Pillar of Defense]], and [[Operation Protective Edge|2014 Operation Protective Edge]]. The number of wars and border conflicts in which the IDF has been involved in its short history makes it one of the most battle-trained armed forces in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts+About+Israel/State/THE+STATE-+Israel+Defense+Forces+-IDF-.htm |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |title=The State: Israel Defense Forces (IDF) |accessdate=9 August 2007 |date=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/idf.htm |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |title=Israel Defense Forces |accessdate=16 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While originally the IDF operated on three fronts—against [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] in the north, [[Jordan]] and [[Iraq]] in the east, and [[Egypt]] in the south—after the 1979 [[Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty]], it has concentrated its activities in [[southern Lebanon]] and the [[Palestinian Territories]], including the [[First Intifada|First]] and the [[Second Intifada]].

The Israel Defense Forces differs from most armed forces in the world in many ways. Differences include the mandatory conscription of women and its structure, which emphasizes close relations between the army, navy, and air force. Since its founding, the IDF has been specifically designed to match Israel's unique security situation. The IDF is one of Israeli society's most prominent institutions, influencing the country's economy, culture and political scene. In 1965, the Israel Defense Forces was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] for its contribution to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashkag/Tashlab_Tashkag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashka|title=Israel Prize recipients in 1965 (in Hebrew)|publisher=Israel Prize Official Site |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wE6Ihijv|archivedate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF uses several technologies developed in Israel, many of them made specifically to match the IDF's needs, such as the [[Merkava]] [[main battle tank]], [[Achzarit]] [[armoured personnel carrier]], high tech weapons systems, the [[Iron Dome]] missile defense system, [[Trophy (countermeasure)|Trophy]] [[active protection system]] for vehicles, and the [[IMI Galil|Galil]] and [[IMI Tavor TAR-21|Tavor]] assault rifles. The [[Uzi]] submachine gun was invented in Israel and used by the IDF until December 2003, ending a service that began in 1954. Following 1967, the IDF has close [[Israel&amp;nbsp;– United States military relations|military relations with the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mahler, Gregory S. |title=Israel After Begin |page=45 |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-7914-0367-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; including development cooperation, such as on the [[F-15I]] jet, [[Tactical High Energy Laser|THEL]] laser defense system, and the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]] defense system.

The Israel Defense Forces are believed to have had an operational nuclear weapons capability since 1967, possessing between 80-400 nuclear weapons,&lt;ref name=&quot;israelcohen&quot;&gt;There are a wide range of estimates as to the size of the Israeli nuclear arsenal. For a compiled list of estimates, see [[Avner Cohen]], ''The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's bargain with the Bomb'' (Columbia University Press, 2010), Table 1, page xxvii and page 82.&lt;/ref&gt; with delivery systems forming a [[nuclear triad]], of plane launched-missiles, [[Jericho_(missile)#Jericho_III|Jericho III intercontinental ballistic missiles]] and [[Popeye_(missile)#Popeye_Turbo_SLCM|submarine launched cruise missiles]].

{{Main|History of the Israel Defense Forces|Wars involving Israel|Military operations conducted by the Israel Defense Forces}}
{{Further|Jewish military history}}
The IDF traces its roots to Jewish paramilitary organizations in the [[Yishuv|New Yishuv]], starting with the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904 to 1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Speedy |url=http://thespeedymedia.blogspot.com/2011/09/idfs-history.html#.U4ei6F4ZffM |title=The Speedy Media: IDF's History |publisher=Thespeedymedia.blogspot.com |date=12 September 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such organization was [[Bar-Giora]], founded in September 1907. It was converted to [[Hashomer]] in April 1909, which operated until the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] came into being in 1920. Hashomer was an elitist organization with narrow scope, and was mainly created to protect against criminal gangs seeking to steal property. During [[World War I]], the forerunners of the Haganah/IDF were the [[Zion Mule Corps]] and the [[Jewish Legion]], both of which were part of the British Army. After the [[1920 Palestine riots|Arab riots]] against Jews in April 1920, the Yishuv's leadership saw the need to create a nationwide underground defense organization, and the [[Haganah]] was founded in June of the same year. The Haganah became a full-scale defense force after the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]] with an organized structure, consisting of three main units—the [[Hish (Haganah corps)|Field Corps]], [[Guard Corps (Haganah)|Guard Corps]], and the [[Palmach]]. During World War II the successor to the Jewish Legion of World War I was the [[Jewish Brigade]].

The IDF was founded following the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|establishment of the State of Israel]], after Defense Minister and Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] issued an order on 26 May 1948. The order called for the establishment of the Israel Defense Forces, and the abolishment of all other Jewish armed forces. Although Ben-Gurion had no legal authority to issue such an order, the order was made legal by [[Cabinet of Israel|the cabinet]] on 31 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;ostfeld-legal&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=An Army is Born (Vol. 1) |author=Ostfeld, Zehava |year=1994 |publisher=[[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Defense]] |pages=104–106 |isbn=978-965-05-0695-7 |editor=ed. Shoshana Shiftel|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two other Jewish underground organizations, [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], agreed to join the IDF if they would be able to form independent units and agreed not to make independent arms purchases. This was the background for the dispute which led to the [[Altalena Affair]], following a confrontation regarding the weapons purchased by the Irgun. This resulted in a battle between Irgun members and the newly created IDF. It ended when the ship carrying the arms was shelled. Following the affair, all independent Irgun and Lehi units were either disbanded or merged into the IDF. The Palmach, a strong lobby within the Haganah, also joined the IDF with [[The Generals' Revolt|provisions]], and Ben Gurion responded by disbanding its staff in 1949, after which many senior Palmach officers retired, notably its first commander, [[Yitzhak Sadeh]].

The new army organized itself during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] when neighbouring Arab states attacked Israel. Twelve [[Infantry Corps (Israel)|infantry]] and [[Armor Corps (Israel)|armored]] brigades formed: [[Golani Brigade|Golani]], [[Carmeli Brigade|Carmeli]], [[Alexandroni Brigade|Alexandroni]], [[Kiryati Brigade|Kiryati]], [[Givati Brigade|Givati]], [[Etzioni Brigade|Etzioni]], the [[7th Armoured Brigade (Israel)|7th]], and [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th]] armored brigades, [[Oded Brigade|Oded]], [[Harel Brigade|Harel]], [[Yiftach Brigade|Yiftach]], and [[Negev Brigade|Negev]].&lt;ref name=&quot;idf-enc-11-15&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Infantry Brigades |encyclopedia=IDF in Its Corps: Army and Security Encyclopedia |last=Pa'il |first=Meir |authorlink=Meir Pa'il |publisher=Revivim Publishing |year=1982 |page=15 |volume=Volume 11 |editor=Yehuda Schiff|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, some of the brigades were converted to reserve units, and others were disbanded. Directorates and corps were created from corps and services in the Haganah, and this basic structure in the IDF [[#Organization|still exists today]].
[[File:1973 sinai war maps2.jpg|thumb|330px|''Operation Gazelle'', Israel's ground maneuver, encircles the Egyptian Third Army, October 1973]]
Immediately after the 1948 war, the Israel Defense Forces shifted to [[Reprisal operations|low intensity conflict]] against [[Palestinian fedayeen|Arab Palestinian guerrillas]]. In the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], the IDF's first test of strength after 1949, the new army proved itself by capturing the [[Sinai Peninsula]] from Egypt, which was later returned. In the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula, [[Gaza Strip]], [[West Bank]] (including [[East Jerusalem]]) and [[Golan Heights]] from the surrounding Arab states, changing the balance of power in the region as well as the role of the IDF. In the following years leading up to the [[Yom Kippur War]], the IDF fought a [[War of Attrition|war of attrition]] against Egypt in the Sinai and a border war against the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] in Jordan, culminating in the [[Battle of Karameh]].

The surprise of the Yom Kippur War and its aftermath completely changed the IDF's procedures and approach to warfare. Organizational changes were made{{By whom|date=January 2010}} and more time was dedicated to training for conventional warfare. However, in the following years the army's role slowly shifted again to [[low-intensity conflict]], [[urban warfare]] and [[counter-terrorism]]. An example of the latter was the successful 1976 [[Operation Entebbe]] commando raid to free hijacked airline passengers being held captive in far-off [[Uganda]]. During this era, the IDF also mounted a [[Operation Opera|successful bombing mission]] in [[Iraq]] to destroy [[Saddam Hussein]]'s nuclear reactor. It was involved in the [[Lebanese Civil War]], initiating [[Operation Litani]] and later the [[1982 Lebanon War]], where the IDF ousted Palestinian guerilla organizations from [[Lebanon]]. Palestinian militancy has been the main focus of the IDF ever since, especially during the [[First Intifada|First]] and [[Second Intifada]]s, [[Operation Defensive Shield]], the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], [[Operation Pillar of Defense]], and [[Operation Protective Edge]], causing the IDF to change many of its values and publish the [[#Code of conduct|IDF Spirit]]. The Islamic [[Shia Islam|Shia]] organization [[Hezbollah]] has also been a growing threat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-hiding-100000-missiles-that-can-hit-north-army-says/|title=Hezbollah hiding 100,000 missiles that can hit north, army says|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; against which the IDF fought an [[South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)|asymmetric conflict]] between 1982 and 2000, as well as a [[2006 Lebanon War|full-scale war]] in 2006.

==Etymology==
The [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] ratified the name &quot;Israel Defense Forces&quot; ({{lang-he-n|צְבָא הַהֲגָנָה לְיִשְׂרָאֵל}}), ''Tzva HaHagana LeYisra'el'', literally &quot;army for the defense of Israel,&quot; on 26 May 1948. The other main contender was ''Tzva Yisra'el'' ({{lang-he-n|צְבָא יִשְׂרָאֵל}}). The name was chosen because it conveyed the idea that the army's role was defense, and because it incorporated the name [[Haganah]], the pre-state defensive organization upon which the new army was based.&lt;ref name=&quot;ostfeld-name&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=An Army is Born (Vol. 1) |author=Ostfeld, Zehava |year=1994 |publisher=[[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Defense]] |pages=113–116 |isbn=978-965-05-0695-7 |editor=ed. Shoshana Shiftel|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the primary opponents of the name were Minister [[Haim-Moshe Shapira]] and the [[Hatzohar]] party, both in favor of ''Tzva Yisra'el''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ostfeld-name&quot; /&gt;

==Organization==
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Honor Guard at IDF Headquarters for Outgoing Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi.jpg|thumb|IDF [[HaKirya|Kirya Compound]], [[Tel Aviv]]]]
All branches of the IDF answer to a single [[General Staff (Israel)|General Staff]]. The [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of the General Staff]] is the only serving officer having the rank of [[Lieutenant General]] (''Rav Aluf''). He reports directly to the [[Defense Minister of Israel|Defense Minister]] and indirectly to the [[Prime Minister of Israel]] and the cabinet. Chiefs of Staff are formally appointed by the cabinet, based on the Defense Minister's recommendation, for three years, but the government can vote to extend their service to four (and in rare occasions even five) years. The current chief of staff is [[Gadi Eizenkot]]. He replaced [[Benny Gantz]] in 2015.

====Ranks====

Unlike most world armies, the IDF uses the same rank names in all corps, including the air force, and navy. All enlisted ranks, as well as some of the officer and NCO ranks, may be given as a result of time spent in service, and not for accomplishment or merit.

For ground forces' officers, rank insignia were brass on a red background; for the air force, silver on a blue background; and for the navy, the standard gold worn on the sleeve. Officer insignia were worn on epaulets on top of both shoulders. Insignia distinctive to each service were worn on the cap (see fig. 15).

Enlisted grades wore rank insignia on the sleeve, halfway between the shoulder and the elbow. For the army and air force, the insignia were white with blue interwoven threads backed with the appropriate corps color. Navy personnel wore gold-colored rank insignia sewn on navy blue material.

From the formation of the IDF until the late 1980s, sergeant major was a particularly important warrant officer rank, in line with usage in other armies. However, in the 1980s and 1990s the proliferating ranks of sergeant major became devalued, and now all professional NCO ranks are a variation on sergeant major (''rav samal'') with the exception of ''rav nagad''.

[[File:Idf-uniform-en.png|thumb|IDF uniform colours]]
[[File:Spike_LR_3.jpg|thumb|Female IDF corporal with the [[Spike (missile)|Spike missile]] launcher, wearing the golden-olive Madei Alef uniform]]
The Israel Defense Forces has several types of uniforms:
* Service dress (מדי אלף ''Madei Alef'' – Uniform &quot;A&quot;)&amp;nbsp;– the everyday uniform, worn by enlisted soldiers.
* [[battledress|Field dress]] ( מדי ב ''Madei Bet'' – Uniform &quot;B&quot;)&amp;nbsp;– worn into combat, training, work on base. 
The first two resemble each other but the Madei Alef is made of higher quality materials in a golden-olive while the madei bet is in [[olive drab]].&lt;ref&gt;Israeli Defence Forces since 1973, Osprey - Elite Series #8, Sam Katz 1986, ISNC 0-85045-887-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;historama.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historama.com/online-resources/history-collecting-resources/militaria/idf_israel_defense_forces_militaria_guide.html#Uniforms |title=Guide to Israeli Militaria, Insignia, Badges, Uniforms &amp; Unit Formations at Historama.com &amp;#124; The Online History Shop |publisher=Historama.com |date=2 August 1945 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dress uniforms may also exhibit a surface shine&lt;ref name=&quot;historama.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garinmahal.com/your-first-day-in-the-idf|title=GarinMahal - Your first day in the IDF|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Officers / Ceremonial dress (מדי שרד ''madei srad'')&amp;nbsp;– worn by officers, or during special events/ceremonies.
* [[Dress uniform]] and [[Mess dress]]&amp;nbsp;– worn only abroad. There are several dress uniforms depending on the season and the branch.

The service uniform for all ground forces personnel is [[olive green]]; navy and air force uniforms are [[beige]] ([[Tan (color)|tan]]). The uniforms consist of a two-pocket shirt, [[combat trousers]], [[sweater]], jacket or blouse, and shoes or boots. The navy also has an all white dress uniform. The green fatigues are the same for winter and summer and heavy winter gear is issued as needed. Women's dress parallels the men's but may substitute a skirt for the trousers.

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Officer Course for Infantry Command.jpg|thumb|IDF female infantry soldiers]]
Headgear included a service cap for dress and semi-dress and a [[field cap]] or [[Boonie hat|bush hat]] worn with fatigues. IDF personnel generally wear [[beret]]s in lieu of the service cap and there are many beret colors issued to IDF Servicemen and Women. [[Paratroopers Brigade|Paratroopers]] are issued a maroon beret, [[Golani Brigade|Golani]] brown, [[Givati Brigade|Givati]] purple, [[Nahal Brigade|Nahal]] lime green, [[Kfir Brigade|Kfir]] camouflage, Combat Engineers gray, navy blue for IDF Naval and dark grey for IDF Air Force personnel. Other beret colors are: black for armored corps, turquoise for artillery personnel; olive drab for infantry; grey for combat engineers. For all other army personnel, except combat units, the beret for men was green and for women, black. Women in the navy wore a black beret with gold insignia. Males in the navy once wore a blue/black beret but replaced it with the [[US Navy]]'s [[sailor cap]].

Some corps or units have small variations in their uniforms&amp;nbsp;– for instance, [[Military Police Corps (Israel)|military policemen]] wear a white belt and police hat, Naval personnel have dress whites for parades, Paratroopers are issued a four pocket Tunic (shirt) meant to be worn untucked with a pistol belt cinched tight around the waist over the shirt. The IDF air corps has a dress uniform consisting of a pale blue shirt with dark blue trousers. Similarly, while most IDF soldiers are issued black leather boots, certain units issue reddish-brown leather boots for historical reasons&amp;nbsp;— the paratroopers, combat medics, [[Nahal]] and [[Kfir Brigade]]s, as well as some SF units ([[Sayeret Matkal]], [[Unit Oketz|Oketz]], [[Duvdevan Unit|Duvdevan]], [[Maglan]], [[Counter-Terror School]]). Women were also formerly issued [[Sandal (footwear)|sandal]]s, but this practice has ceased.

====Insignia====
{{Main|Israel Defense Forces insignia}}
IDF soldiers have three types of insignia (other than rank insignia) which identify their corps, specific unit, and position.

A pin attached to the beret identifies a soldier's corps. Soldiers serving in staffs above corps level are often identified by the General Corps pin, despite not officially belonging to it, or the pin of a related corps. New recruits undergoing [[basic training]] (''[[tironut]]'') do not have a pin. Beret colors are also often indicative of the soldier's corps, although most non-combat corps do not have their own beret, and sometimes wear the color of the corps to which the post they're stationed in belongs. Individual units are identified by a shoulder tag attached to the left [[shoulder strap]]. Most units in the IDF have their own tags, although those that do not, generally use tags identical to their command's tag (corps, directorate, or regional command).

While one cannot always identify the position/job of a soldier, two optional factors help make this identification: an [[aiguillette]] attached to the left shoulder strap and shirt pocket, and a pin indicating the soldier's work type (usually given by a professional course). Other pins may indicate the corps or additional courses taken. Finally, an optional battle pin indicates a war that a soldier has fought in.

===Military service routes===
The military service is held in three different tracks:
* '''Regular service''' (שירות חובה) – mandatory military service which is held according to the Israeli security service law.
* '''Permanent Service''' (שירות קבע) – military service which is held as part of a contractual agreement between the IDF and the permanent position holder.
* '''[[Reserve duty (Israel)|Reserve service]]''' (שירות מילואים) – a military service in which citizens are called for active duty of at most a month every year (In accordance with the Reserve Service Law), for training activities and ongoing defense activities and especially for the purpose of increasing the military forces in case of a war.

Sometimes the IDF would also hold pre-military courses (קורס קדם צבאי or קד&quot;צ) for soon to be regular service soldiers.

===Special service routes===
* '''[[Shoher]]''' (שוחר), a person enrolled in pre-military studies (High School, Technical College up to Eng degree, some of the קד&quot;ץ courses) – after completing the 12th study year will do a 2-month boot-camp and, if allowed, enter a program of education to qualify as a [[Practical engineer]], with at least two weeks of training following each study year. Successful candidates will continue for an Engineering [[Bachelor degree]]. [[Shoher]] will be enrolled into regular service if he dropped out before finished his P.A. education or in any finishing education stage (after High School, after P.A. or after receiving the bachelor's degree). Another example of a [[Shoher]] is a [[programmer]] that is under the programming course of '''School for Computer Professions''' ({{lang-he|בית הספר למקצועות המחשב}}, abbr. Basmach - בסמ&quot;ח). The course usually lasts about 6 months, and at its peak, the [[Shoher]] receives a programmer badge.
Shoher will have the ability to serve in R&amp;D units without having the engineering credentials if an officer finds him as worthy and could recommend him for the R&amp;D units, R&amp;D unit have the option to provide &quot;על תקן מהנדס&quot; certificate for few selected personal to allow person to work on life saving or flight equipment without having an Eng. license (the certificate isn't valid for medical R&amp;D machinery), the certificate is provided by the highest in command in the research field (as an example for the Air Force it is the Chief of Equipment Group).

* '''Civilian working for the IDF''' (אזרח עובד צה&quot;ל), a civilian working for the military.

The [[Manpower Directorate|Israeli Manpower Directorate]] (אגף משאבי אנוש) at the [[General Staff (Israel)|Israeli General Staff]] is the body which coordinates and assembles activities related to the control over human resources and its placement.

====Regular service====
{{Main|Conscription in Israel}}
[[File:Nahal-kumta.jpg|thumb|IDF [[Nahal Brigade]] soldiers on their regular service]]

National military service is mandatory for all [[Israelis|Israeli]] citizens over the age of 18, although [[Arab-Israeli|Arab]] (but not [[Druze]]) citizens are exempted if they so please, and other exceptions may be made on religious, physical or psychological grounds (see [[Profile 21]]). The [[Tal law]], which exempts ultra-orthodox Jews from service, has been the subject of several court cases as well as considerable legislative controversy.

Until the draft of July 2015, men served three years in the IDF. Men drafted as of July 2015 and later will serve 2 years and 8 months (32 months), with some roles requiring an additional 4 months of Permanent service. Women serve two years. The IDF women who volunteer for several combat positions often serve for three years, due to the longer period of training. Women in other positions, such as programmers, who also require lengthy training time, may also serve three years.

Some distinguished recruits are selected to be trained in order to eventually become members of [[Sayeret|special forces units]]. Every brigade in the IDF has its own special force branch.

Career soldiers are paid on average [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] 23,000 a month, fifty times the NIS 460 paid to conscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/business/barak-wants-to-pay-minimum-wage-to-idf-conscripts-1.393937 Zrahiya, Zvi. ''Haaretz Newspaper'', 6 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998-2000, only about 9% of those who [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military|refused to serve in the Israeli military]] were granted exemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dayan |first=Aryeh |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/pacifists-are-fighting-hard-against-the-draft-1.51499 |title=Pacifists are fighting hard against the draft - Israel News |publisher=Haaretz |date=3 March 2002 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permanent service====
[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|right|IDF soldier, [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon#Author|Asael lubotzky]] prays with tefillin.]]
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - The IDF Honors Its Reservists.jpg|thumb|IDF Reservists train in the [[Golan Heights]]]]
Permanent service is designed for soldiers who choose to continue serving in the army after their regular service, for a short or long period, and in many cases making the military their career. Permanent service usually begins immediately after the mandatory Regular service period, but there are also soldiers who get released from military at the end of the mandatory Regular service period and who get recruited back to the military as Permanent service soldiers in a later period.

Permanent service is based on a contractual agreement between the IDF and the permanent position holder. The service contract defines how long the soldier's service would be, and towards the end of the contract period a discussion may rise on the extension of the soldier's service duration. Many times, regular service soldiers are required to commit to a permanent service after the mandatory Regular service period, in exchange for assigning them in military positions which require a long training period.

In exchange for the Permanent service, the Permanent service soldiers receive full wages, and when serving for a long period as a permanent service soldier, they are also entitled for a pension from the army. This right is given to the Permanent service soldiers in a relatively early stage of their life in comparison to the rest of the Israeli retirees.

====Reserve service====
{{main|Reserve duty (Israel)}}
After personnel complete their regular service, they are either granted permanent exemption from military service, or assigned a position in the reserve forces. There is no distinction between assignment of men or women to reserve service.

The IDF may call up reservists for:
* reserve service of up to one month every three years, until the age of 40 (enlisted) or 45 (officers). Reservists may volunteer after this age, with approval of the Manpower Directorate.
* immediate active duty in war time.

In most cases, the reserve duty is carried out in the same unit for years, in many cases the same unit as the active service and by the same people. Many soldiers who have served together in active service continue to meet in reserve duty for years after their discharge, causing reserve duty to become a strong [[male bonding]] experience in Israeli society.

Although still available for call-up in times of crisis, most Israeli men, and virtually all women, do not actually perform reserve service in any given year. Units do not always call up all of their reservists every year, and a variety of exemptions are available if called for regular reserve service. Virtually no exemptions exist for reservists called up in a time of crisis, but experience has shown that in such cases (most recently, the 2014 Operation Protective Edge) exemptions are rarely requested or exercised; units generally achieve recruitment rates above those considered fully manned.

[[File:Israel 4 021.Israelic Soldier.jpg|thumb|The Israel Border Police (''Magav'') is responsible for security in urban or rural areas]]
Legislation (Approved in April 2008) has reformed the reserve service, lowering the maximum service age to 40 for enlisted, and 45 for officers, designating it as an emergency and security force (disallowing routine duties that may be carried out by the active forces), as well as many other changes to the structure (although the Defense Minister can suspend any portion of it at any time for security reasons). The age threshold for many reservists whose positions are listed and updated yearly by the Knesset through the Occupations executive order is fixed at 45 or 49, depending on their military occupation and position.

===Non-IDF service===
Other than the National Service (''[[Sherut Leumi]]''), IDF conscripts may serve in bodies other than the IDF in a number of ways.

The combat option is [[Israel Border Police]] (''Magav'' – the exact translation from Hebrew means &quot;border guard&quot;) service, part of the [[Israel Police]]. Some soldiers complete their IDF combat training and later undergo additional [[counter terror]] and Border Police training. These are assigned to Border Police units. The Border Police units fight side by side with the regular IDF combat units though to a lower capacity. They are also responsible for security in heavy urban areas such as [[Jerusalem]] and security and crime fighting in rural areas.

Non-combat services include the Mandatory Police Service (''Shaham'') program, where youth serve in the [[Israeli Police]], [[Israel Prison Service]], or other wings of the [[Israeli Security Forces]] instead of the regular army service.

Israel is one of only a few nations that conscript women or deploy them in combat roles, although in practice, women can avoid conscription through a religious exemption and over a third of Israeli women do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/121173/abuse-of-idf-exemptions-questioned/ Abuse of IDF Exemptions Questioned] The Jewish Daily Forward, 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, 88% of all roles in the IDF are open to female candidates. and women could be found in 69% of all IDF positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idfblog.com/blog/2010/08/25/statistics-womens-service-in-the-idf-for-2010-25-aug-2010/ Statistics: Women's Service in the IDF for 2010] IDF, 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the IDF, 535 female Israeli soldiers had been killed in combat operations between the period 1962-2016 (this figure does not include the dozens of female soldiers killed in Israeli service prior to 1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.719038?v=BDD11CFC5DFD7E6A2F0CD56A63DF587A|title=Israeli woman who broke barriers downed by Hezbollah rocket  as 2006 combat volunteer - Israel News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF concedes that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions. Rather, they are concentrated in &quot;combat-support&quot; positions which command a lower compensation and status than combat positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaza: It's a Man's War&quot;&gt;[http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/gaza-a-mans-war-israel-gender/375689/ Gaza: It's a Man's War] The Atlantic, 7 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian pilot and aeronautical engineer Alice Miller successfully petitioned the High Court of Justice to take the Israeli Air Force pilot training exams, after being rejected on grounds of gender. Though president [[Ezer Weizman]], a former IAF commander, told Miller that she would be better off staying home and darning socks, the court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller would not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in new IDF roles. Female legislators took advantage of the momentum to draft a bill allowing women to volunteer for any position, if they could qualify.&lt;ref name=&quot;feldinger&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Lauren Gelfond Feldinger|title=Skirting history|work=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=22 March 2011|date=21 September 2008|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=114834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Equality amendment to the Military Service law stated that the right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men.&lt;ref name=mfaWomen&gt;{{cite web|title=Integration of women in the IDF|publisher=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Israel+beyond+politics/Integration_women_in_IDF-March_2009 |accessdate=23 March 2011|date=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of women in the IDF from 2002 to 2005 found that women often exhibit &quot;superior skills&quot; in discipline, motivation and marksmanship. However, the study noted that women still face gender discrimination in the IDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130125-women-combat-world-australia-israel-canada-norway/|title=8 Other Nations That Send Women to Combat|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have taken part in Israel’s military before and since the founding of the state in 1948.&lt;ref name=womenIDF&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the IDF|url=http://idfspokesperson.com/2011/03/07/women-in-the-idf/|publisher=Israel Defense Forces|accessdate=22 March 2011|date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women started to enter combat support and light combat roles in a few areas, including the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armored divisions. A few platoons named Karakal were formed for men and women to serve together in light infantry. By 2000 Karakal became a [[Caracal Battalion|full-fledged battalion]], with a second mixed-gender battalion, Lions of the Jordan (אריות הירדן, Arayot Ha-Yarden) formed in 2015.

In June 2011, Maj. General [[Orna Barbivai]] became the first female major general in the IDF, replacing head of the directorate Maj. General Avi Zamir. Barbivai stated, &quot;I am proud to be the first woman to become a major general and to be part of an organization in which equality is a central principle. 90 percent of jobs in the IDF are open to women and I am sure that there are other women who will continue to break down barriers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|title=Orna Barbivai becomes first female IDF major general|url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?id=226336|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yedioth Ahronot&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenberg|first=Hanan|title=IDF names 1st female major-general|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4074563,00.html|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=Yedioth Ahronot|date=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the IDF announced they would, for the first time, allow a (MTF) transgender woman to serve in the army as a female soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awiderbridge.org/transgender-in-the-idf/#sthash.ZAUcxHOz.dpuf |title=Transgender in the IDF |publisher=AWiderBridge |date=7 August 2013 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minorities in the IDF==
Non-Jewish minorities tended to serve in one of several special units: the [[Unit of the Minorities|Minorities Unit]], also known as Unit 300; the Druze Reconnaissance Unit; and the Trackers Unit, which comprised mostly [[Negev Bedouins]]. In 1982, the IDF general staff decided to integrate the armed forces by opening up other units to minorities, while placing some Jewish conscripts in the Minorities Unit. Until 1988, the intelligence corps and the air force remained closed to minorities.

===Druze and Circassians===
[[File:DruzeSoldier.jpg|thumb|[[Druze]] commander of the IDF Herev battalion]]

Although Israel has a majority of Jewish soldiers, large numbers of [[Israeli Druze|Druze]] and [[Circassians in Israel|Circassian]] men are subject to mandatory conscription to the IDF just like [[Israeli Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aka.idf.il/brothers/skira/default.asp?catId=57478&amp;docId |title=IDF human resources site |publisher=IDF |accessdate=10 June 2010|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, they served in the framework of a special unit called &quot;The Minorities' Unit&quot;, which operated until 2015 in the form of the independent Herev [[IDF Sword Battalion|(&quot;Sword&quot;) battalion]]. However, since the 1980s, Druze soldiers have increasingly protested this practice, which they considered a means of segregating them and denying them access to elite units (like [[sayeret]] units). The army has increasingly admitted Druze soldiers to regular combat units and promoted them to higher ranks from which they had been previously excluded. In 2015, Rav Aluf [[Gadi Eizenkot]] has ordered the unit's closure in order to assimilate the Druze soldiers no differently than Jewish soldiers, as part of an ongoing reorganization of the army. In recent years, several Druze officers have reached ranks as high as Major General and many have received commendations for distinguished service. In proportion to their numbers, the Druze people achieve much higher—documented—levels in the Israeli army than other soldiers. Nevertheless, some Druze still charge that discrimination continues, such as exclusion from the [[Israel Air Force|Air Force]], although the official low security classification for Druze has been abolished for some time. The first Druze aircraft navigator completed his training course in 2005; his identity is protected as are those of all air force pilots. During the [[Israeli War of Independence]], many Druze who had initially sided with the Arabs deserted their ranks to either return to their villages or side with Israel in various capacities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelber&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Druze and Jews in the war of 1948.

Since the late 1970s, the [[Druze Initiative Committee]], centered at the village of [[Beit Jan]] and linked to the [[Israeli Communist Party]], has campaigned to abolish Druze conscription.

Military service is a tradition among some of the Druze population, with most opposition in Druze communities of the [[Golan Heights]]; 83 percent of Druze boys serve in the army, according to the IDF's statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=129391 |title=Covenant of blood |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |author=Larry Derfner |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Israeli army, 369 Druze soldiers have been killed in combat operations since 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dover.idf.il/IDF/News_Channels/Personal/10/10/1102.htm|title=מוכנים לטייס הדרוזי הראשון?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bedouins and Israeli Arabs===

By law, all Israeli citizens are subject to conscription. The Defense Minister has complete discretion to grant exemption to individual citizens or classes of citizens. A long-standing policy dating to Israel's early years extends an exemption to all other Israeli minorities (most notably [[Israeli Arab]]s). However, there is a long-standing government policy of encouraging [[Bedouin]]s to volunteer and of offering them various inducements, and in some impoverished Bedouin communities a military career seems one of the few means of (relative) social mobility available. Also, Muslims and Christians are accepted as volunteers, even at an age greater than 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aka.idf.il/brothers/skira/default.asp?catId=57479&amp;docId= |title=IDF Human Resources site |accessdate=10 June 2010|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From among non-Bedouin Arab citizens, the number of volunteers for military service—some [[Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians|Christian Arabs]] and even a few Muslim Arabs—is minute, and the government makes no special effort to increase it. Six Israeli Arabs have received orders of distinction as a result of their military service; of them the most famous is a Bedouin officer, Lieutenant Colonel Abd el-Majid Hidr (also known as [[Amos Yarkoni]]), who received the Order of Distinction. Vahid el Huzil was the first Bedouin to be a battalion commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/271/121.html |title=History in Tzahal the first Bedouin to be Battalion Commander |publisher=Nrg.co.il |date= |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/9/782336 |title=a Bedouin officer got the command on a battalion |publisher=News.walla.co.il |date= |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, a Bedouin officer was promoted to the rank of Colonel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Until the second term of [[Yitzhak Rabin]] as Prime Minister (1992–1995), social benefits given to families in which at least one member (including a grandfather, uncle or cousin) had served at some time in the armed forces were significantly higher than to &quot;non-military&quot; families, which was considered a means of blatant discrimination between Jews and Arabs. Rabin had led the abolition of the measure, in the teeth of strong opposition from the Right. At present, the only official advantage from military service is the attaining of security clearance and serving in some types of government positions (in most cases, security-related), as well as some indirect benefits.

Rather than perform army service, Israeli Arab youths have the option to volunteer to [[Sherut Leumi|national service]] and receive benefits similar to those received by discharged soldiers. The volunteers are generally allocated to Arab populations, where they assist with social and community matters. {{As of|2010}} there are 1,473 Arabs volunteering for national service. According to sources in the national service administration, Arab leaders are counseling youths to refrain from performing services to the state. According to a National Service official, &quot;For years the Arab leadership has demanded, justifiably, benefits for Arab youths similar to those received by discharged soldiers. Now, when this opportunity is available, it is precisely these leaders who reject the state's call to come and do the service, and receive these benefits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3974580,00.html Rise in Arab National Service volunteers], by Aviel Magnezi. YNet, 25 October 2010, 14:47&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Arabs are not obligated to serve in IDF, any Arab can volunteer. A Muslim Arab woman is currently serving as a medic with unit 669.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;First female Arab soldier joins elite unit 669 &quot;, [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3527584,00.html online]:

Cpl. [[Elinor Joseph]] from [[Haifa]] became the first female Arab combat soldier for IDF. Elinor said &quot;there was a Katyusha [rocket] that fell near my house and also hurt Arabs.

But really, their treatment was always full of respect.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Arab-Muslim officers in the IDF are Hisham Abu Varia, who is currently a [[Second Lieutenant]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ynetFirsftOff&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Pevzner|first=Yana|title=The lone Arab Soldier|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3968706,00.html|accessdate=27 October 2010|newspaper=Ynet|date=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Major]] Ala Wahib, who is currently the highest ranking Muslim officer in the IDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An officer and a Muslim Zionist |author=Michal Yaakov Yitzhaki |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5727 |newspaper=[[Israel HaYom]] |date=7 September 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Falasha makstyle.jpg|thumb|150px|An [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian-Jewish]] soldier]]

In October 2012, the IDF promoted Mona Abdo to become the first female Christian Arab to the rank of combat commander. Abdo had voluntarily enlisted in the IDF, which her family had encouraged, and transferred from the [[Ordnance Corps (Israel)|Ordnance Corps]] to the [[Caracal Battalion]], a mixed-gender unit with both Jewish and Arab soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/10/18/israel-promotes-first-female-christian-arab-to-combat-commander/ |title=Israel Promotes First Female Christian Arab to Combat Commander |publisher=The Algemeiner |date=18 October 2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, there has been an increase of Israeli Christian Arabs joining the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.573172 |title=Israeli army sees increase in Christian Arab recruits |work=Haaretz |date=9 February 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopian Jews===
The IDF carried out extended missions in [[Ethiopia]] and neighboring states, whose purpose was to protect [[Ethiopian Jews]] (Beta Israel) and to help their immigration to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish State: The Struggle for Israel's Soul''. Yoram Hazony. 2001. Page 54&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF adopted policies and special activities for absorption and integration of Ethiopian immigrant soldiers, which resulted in great positive impact on the achievements and integration of those soldiers in the army as well as Israeli society in general.&lt;ref&gt;The Beta Israel in Ethiopia and Israel: studies on Ethiopian Jews By Tudor Parfitt, Emanuela Trevisan Semi. p.170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel social science research, Volumes 10–11.

===Haredim===
[[File:NetzahYehudafield.jpg|thumb|IDF soldiers of the religious [[Netzah Yehuda Battalion|97th &quot;Netzah Yehuda&quot; Infantry Battalion]]]]

Men in the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community may choose to defer service while enrolled in ''[[Yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' (see [[Tal committee]]); many avoid conscription altogether. This special arrangement is called [[Torato Omanuto]], and has given rise to [[religious relations in Israel|tensions]] between the Israeli religious and secular communities. While options exist for Haredim to serve in the IDF in an atmosphere conducive to their religious convictions, most Haredim do not choose to serve in the IDF.

Haredi males have the option of serving in the [[Netzah Yehuda Battalion|97th &quot;Netzah Yehuda&quot; Infantry Battalion]]. This unit is a standard IDF infantry battalion focused on the [[Jenin]] region. To allow Haredi soldiers to serve, the Netzah Yehuda military bases follow the highest standards of [[Jewish dietary laws]]; the only women permitted on these bases are wives of soldiers and officers. Additionally, some Haredim serve in the IDF via the [[Hesder]] system, principally designed for the [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] sector; it is a 5-year program which includes 2 years of religious studies, 1½ years of military service and 1½ years of religious studies during which the soldiers can be recalled to active duty at any moment. Haredi soldiers are permitted to join other units of the IDF as well, but rarely do.

The IDF has identified an urgent gap of hundreds of soldiers in their technical units that might be filled by the Haredi. The IAF is currently using [[defense contractor]]s to fill in the gaps and continue operations.&lt;ref&gt;Harel, Amos. [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/idf-ultra-orthodox-recruits-can-plug-gap-in-technical-units.premium-1.435374 &quot;IDF: Ultra-Orthodox recruits can plug gap in technical units.&quot;] ''Haaretz'', 10 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the IDF claims it will not discriminate against women, it is offering Haredim &quot;women free and secular free&quot; recruitment centers. Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon expressed his willingness to relax regulations to meet the demands of ultra-Orthodox rabbis. Regulations regarding gender equality had already been relaxed so that Haredim could be assured that men would not receive physical exams from female medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4586197,00.html|title=IDF offers haredim 'women-free' recruitment centers|work=ynet|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT people===&lt;!-- Linked to by Sexual orientation and military service#Israel--&gt;
{{Further|Sexual orientation and military service#Israel}}

Israel is one of 24 nations that allow openly gay individuals to serve in the military. Since the early 1990s, sexual identity presents no formal barrier in terms of soldiers' military specialization or eligibility for promotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;eichner&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne B. Goldberg, &quot;Open Service and Our Allies: A Report on the Inclusion of Openly Gay and Lesbian Servicemembers in U.S. Allies' Armed Forces,&quot; ''William &amp; Mary Journal of Women &amp; Law'' (2011) v 17 pp 547–90 [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol17/iss3/3 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1980s, the IDF tended to discharge soldiers who were openly gay. In 1983, the IDF permitted homosexuals to serve, but banned them from intelligence and top-secret positions. A decade later, Professor Uzi Even,&lt;ref name=&quot;barbara&quot; /&gt; an IDF reserves officer and chairman of [[Tel Aviv University]]'s Chemistry Department, revealed that his rank had been revoked and that he had been barred from researching sensitive topics in military intelligence, solely because of his sexual orientation. His testimony to the [[Knesset]] in 1993 raised a political storm, forcing the IDF to remove such restrictions against gays.&lt;ref name=&quot;eichner&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Eichner|first=Itamar|title=Follow Israel's example on gays in the military, US study says|publisher=Ynetnews|accessdate=10 June 2010|date=8 February 2007|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3362505,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief of staff's policy states that it is strictly forbidden to harm or hurt anyone's dignity or feeling based on their gender or sexual orientation in any way, including signs, slogans, pictures, poems, lectures, any means of guidance, propaganda, publishing, voicing, and utterance. Moreover, gays in the IDF have additional rights, such as the right to take a shower alone if they want to. According to a [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] study,&lt;ref name=&quot;barbara&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmforum.org/films/yossi/israelstudyafs.pdf |title=Homosexuality and the Israel Defense Forces: Did Lifting the Gay Ban Undermine Military Performance? |format=PDF |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a brigadier general stated that Israelis show a &quot;great tolerance&quot; for gay soldiers. Consul [[David Saranga]] at the Israeli Consulate in New York, who was interviewed by the ''St. Petersburg Times'', said, &quot;It's a non-issue. You can be a very good officer, a creative one, a brave one, and be gay at the same time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eichner&quot; /&gt;

A study published by the [[Israel Gay Youth]] (IGY) Movement in January 2012 found that half of the homosexual soldiers who serve in the IDF suffer from violence and homophobia, although the head of the group said that &quot;I am happy to say that the intention among the top brass is to change that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?id=273609 |title=Does viral IDF Gay Pride photo show full picture? |author= Yaakov Katz |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deaf and hard-of-hearing people===
Israel is the only country in the world that requires the deaf and hard-of-hearing people to serve in the conscription or military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=11734 |title=IDF enables diabetes victims, deaf to be drafted |work=Jerusalem Post |date=31 January 2006 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sign language interpreters are provided during training, and many of them serve in the non-combat capacities such as mappers, office work, and the like. The deaf and hard-of-hearing people who have served in the IDF have better opportunities in employment, housing, education, and other areas than those who do not serve. In addition, they gain a greater respect and recognition for their service and contribution to the country as well as stronger self-esteem and motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shema.org.il/?CategoryID=302|title=about|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegans===
According to a [[Care2]] report, vegans in the IDF may refuse vaccination if they oppose animal testing. They are provided with special allowances to buy their own food. They are also given artificial leather boots and a black fleece beret.&lt;ref name=&quot;C2-20121103&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.care2.com/news/member/296771588/3479034|title=Israel: Veganism promoted in defence forces|date=3 November 2012|publisher=[[Care2]]|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteers===
In cases when a citizen cannot be normally drafted by the law (old age, served as a soldier in a different country, severe health problems, handicaps, autism, etc.), the person could enroll as a volunteer in places where his knowledge can be used or in cases where there is a base that accepts volunteer service from one day per week up to full 24/7 service based upon that person's abilities and wishes.

==Overseas volunteers==
Non-immigrating foreign volunteers typically serve with the IDF in one of five ways:
* The [[Mahal (Israel)|Mahal]] program targets young non-Israeli Jews or Israeli citizens who grew up abroad (men younger than 24 and women younger than 21). The program consists typically of 18 months of IDF service, including a lengthy training for those in combat units or (for 18 months) one month of non-combat training and additional two months of learning [[Hebrew]] after enlisting, if necessary. There are two additional subcategories of Mahal, both geared solely for religious men: Mahal [[Netzah Yehuda Battalion|Nahal Haredi]] (18 months), and Mahal [[Hesder]], which combines yeshiva study of 5 months with IDF service of 16 months, for a total of 21 months. Similar IDF programs exist for Israeli overseas residents. To be accepted as a Mahal Volunteer, one must be of Jewish descent (at least one Jewish grandparent).
* [[Sar-El]], an organization subordinate to the Israeli [[Logistics Corps]], provides a volunteer program for non-Israeli citizens who are 17 years or older (or 15 if accompanied by a parent). The program is also aimed at Israeli citizens, aged 30 years or older, living abroad who did not serve in the Israeli Army and who now wish to finalize their status with the military. The program usually consists of three weeks of volunteer service on different rear army bases, doing non-combative work.
* [[Garin Tzabar]] offers a program mainly for Israelis who emigrated with their parents to the United States at a young age. Although a basic knowledge of the Hebrew language is not mandatory, it is helpful. Of all the programs listed, only Garin Tzabar requires full-length service in the IDF. The program is set up in stages: first the participants go through five seminars in their country of origin, then have an absorption period in Israel at a [[kibbutz]]. Each delegation is adopted by a kibbutz in Israel and has living quarters designated for it. The delegation shares responsibilities in the kibbutz when on military leave. Participants start the program three months before being enlisted in the army at the beginning of August.
* [[Marva]] is short-term basic training for two months.
* [[Lev LaChayal]] is a program based at [[Yeshivat Lev Hatorah]] which takes a holistic approach to preparation for service. Being as ready as possible for integrating into Israeli culture, handling the physical challenges of the military, and maintaining religious values require a multi-pronged approach. The beit midrash learning, classes, physical training, and even the recreational activities are designed to allow for maximum readiness.

The document defines three core values for all IDF soldiers to follow, as well as ten secondary values (the first being most important, and the others appearing sorted in Hebrew alphabetical order):&lt;ref name=&quot;idf-spirit&quot; /&gt;

;Core values:
* '''Defense of the State, its Citizens and its Residents''' – &quot;The IDF's goal is to defend the existence of the State of Israel, its independence and the security of the citizens and residents of the state.&quot;
* '''Love of the Homeland and Loyalty to the Country''' – &quot;At the core of service in the IDF stand the love of the homeland and the commitment and devotion to the State of Israel-a democratic state that serves as a national home for the Jewish People-its citizens and residents.&quot;
* '''Human Dignity''' – &quot;The IDF and its soldiers are obligated to protect human dignity. Every human being is of value regardless of his or her origin, religion, nationality, gender, status or position.&quot;

;Other values:

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Nachal Brigade On Historical Trek (1).jpg|thumb||[[Nahal Brigade]] soldiers pay respect to fallen comrades at [[Mt. Herzl]]'s Military Cemetery]]

* '''Tenacity of Purpose in Performing Missions and Drive to Victory''' – &quot;The IDF servicemen and women will fight and conduct themselves with courage in the face of all dangers and obstacles; They will persevere in their missions resolutely and thoughtfully even to the point of endangering their lives.&quot;
* '''[[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]]''' – &quot;The IDF servicemen or women will see themselves as active participants in the defense of the state, its citizens and residents. They will carry out their duties at all times with initiative, involvement and diligence with common sense and within the framework of their authority, while prepared to bear responsibility for their conduct.&quot;
* '''[[Credibility]]''' – &quot;The IDF servicemen and women shall present things objectively, completely and precisely, in planning, performing and reporting. They will act in such a manner that their peers and commanders can rely upon them in performing their tasks.&quot;
* '''Personal Example''' – &quot;The IDF servicemen and women will comport themselves as required of them, and will demand of themselves as they demand of others, out of recognition of their ability and responsibility within the military and without to serve as a deserving role model.&quot;
* '''Human Life''' – &quot;The IDF servicemen and women will act in a judicious and safe manner in all they do, out of recognition of the supreme value of human life. During combat they will endanger themselves and their comrades only to the extent required to carry out their mission.&quot;
* '''[[Purity of Arms]]''' – &quot;The soldier shall make use of his weaponry and power only for the fulfillment of the mission and solely to the extent required; he will maintain his humanity even in combat. The soldier shall not employ his weaponry and power in order to harm non-combatants or prisoners of war, and shall do all he can to avoid harming their lives, body, honor and property.&quot;
* '''[[Professionalism]]''' – &quot;The IDF servicemen and women will acquire the professional knowledge and skills required to perform their tasks, and will implement them while striving continuously to perfect their personal and collective achievements.&quot;
* '''Discipline''' – &quot;The IDF servicemen and women will strive to the best of their ability to fully and successfully complete all that is required of them according to orders and their spirit. IDF soldiers will be meticulous in giving only lawful orders, and shall refrain from obeying blatantly illegal orders.&quot;
* '''Comradeship''' – &quot;The IDF servicemen and women will act out of fraternity and devotion to their comrades, and will always go to their assistance when they need their help or depend on them, despite any danger or difficulty, even to the point of risking their lives.&quot;
* '''Sense of Mission''' – &quot;The IDF soldiers view their service in the IDF as a mission; they will be ready to give their all in order to defend the state, its citizens and residents. This is due to the fact that they are representatives of the IDF who act on the basis and in the framework of the authority given to them in accordance with IDF orders.&quot;

====Military ethics of fighting terror====

In 2005, [[Asa Kasher]] and [[Amos Yadlin]] co-authored a noticed article published in the ''Journal of Military Ethics'' under the title: &quot;Military Ethics of Fighting Terror: An Israeli Perspective&quot;. The article was meant as an &quot;extension of the classical Just War Theory&quot;, and as a &quot;[needed] third model&quot; or missing paradigm besides which of &quot;classical war (army) and law enforcement (police).&quot;, resulting in a &quot;doctrine (...) on the background of the IDF fight against acts and activities of terror performed by Palestinian individuals and organizations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15027570510014642| title = Military Ethics of Fighting Terror: An Israeli Perspective (abstract)| date = April 2005| last1 = Kasher | first1 = A. | last2 = Yadlin | first2 = A. | journal = Journal of Military Ethics| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = 3–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, Kasher and Yadlin came to the conclusion that [[targeted killing]]s of terrorists were justifiable, even at the cost of hitting nearby civilians. In a 2009 interview to ''[[Haaretz]]'', Asa Kasher later confirmed, pointing to the fact that in an area in which the IDF does not have effective security control (e.g., Gaza, vs. Est-Jerusalem), soldiers' lives protection takes priority over avoiding injury to enemy civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/the-philosopher-who-gave-the-idf-moral-justification-in-gaza-1.269527|title=The Philosopher Who Gave the IDF Moral Justification in Gaza|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, along with [[Avishai Margalit]] and [[Michael Walzer]], have recused this argument, advancing that such position was &quot;contrary to centuries of theorizing about the morality of war as well as international humanitarian law&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestine-studies.org/journals.aspx?id=10705&amp;jid=1&amp;href=fulltext Khalidi,''The Most Moral Army in the World?'', Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol 39, no. 3 (Spring 2010), p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt; since drawing &quot;a sharp line between combatants and noncombatants&quot; would be &quot;the only morally relevant distinction that all those involved in a war can agree on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/may/14/israel-civilians-combatants/ Margalit and Walzer, ''Israel: Civilians &amp; Combatants'', New York Review of Books, May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The article was intended to (then Chief of Staff) [[Moshe Ya'alon]], to serve as a basis for a new &quot;code of conduct&quot;. Although Moshe Ya'alon did endorse the article's views, and is reported to have presented it numerous times before military forums, it was never actually turned into a binding IDF document or an actual &quot;code&quot;, neither by Ya'alon nor its successors. However, the document have since reportedly been adapted to serve as educational material, designed to emphasizes the right behavior in [[low intensity warfare]] against terrorists, where soldiers must operate within a civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/IDFmorals.html Guinora, ''Teaching Morality in Armed Conflict: The Israel Defense Forces Model'', Jewish Virtual Library, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of today &quot;The Spirit of the IDF&quot; (cf. supra) is still considered the only biding moral code that formally applies to the IDF troops. In 2009, [[Amos Yadlin]] (then head of [[Military Intelligence]]) suggested that the article he co-authored with [[Asa Kasher]] be ratified as a formal binding code, arguing that &quot;the current code ['The Spirit of the IDF'] does not sufficiently address one of the army's most pressing challenges: [[asymmetric warfare]] against terrorist organizations that operate amid a civilian population&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/mi-idf-needs-new-ethics-code-for-war-on-terror-1.6991 Harel, ''MI: IDF needs new ethics code for war on terror'', Haaretz, 30 September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11 key points highlighted in the article and educational material mentioned above:
# Military action can be taken only against military targets.
# The use of force must be proportional.
# Soldiers may only use weaponry they were issued by the IDF.
# Anyone who surrenders cannot be attacked.
# Only those who are properly trained can interrogate prisoners.
# Soldiers must accord dignity and respect to the Palestinian population and those arrested.
# Soldiers must give appropriate medical care, when conditions allow, to themselves and to enemies.
# Pillaging is absolutely and totally illegal.
# Soldiers must show proper respect for religious and cultural sites and artifacts.
# Soldiers must protect international aid workers, including their property and vehicles.
# Soldiers must report all violations of this code.

==Command and control==
According to the Israeli ''Basic Law: The IDF'' adopted in 1976, the IDF is subject to the authority of the Government. The Minister in charge of the IDF on behalf of the Government is the Minister of Defense. The supreme command level in the military, the Chief of the General Staff, the military's Commander in Chief, is appointed by and subject to the authority of the civilian Government and is subordinate to the Minister of Defense (not the Ministry of Defense itself).

However, in the years after the establishment of Israel, the Military establishment enjoyed a degree of independence given to it by Ben-Gurion. This was evident in the attendance of the Chief of General Staff in Cabinet and security Cabinet meetings as an equal and not as a subordinate. Even after the [[Agranat Commission]] inquiry following the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], when the roles, the powers, and the duties of the Prime Minister, Defense Minister and Chief of General Staff were clarified and the rules and standards of monitoring where established between the military and the political spheres, the military still continued to enjoy an overlarge status on the expense of the civilian authority.

==Budget==
During 1950–66, Israel spent an average of 9% of its GDP on defense. Defense expenditures increased dramatically after both the 1967 and 1973 wars. They reached a high of about 24% of GDP in the 1980s, but have since come down significantly, following the signing of peace agreements with Jordan and Egypt.

On 30 September 2009 Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz and Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] endorsed an additional NIS 1.5 billion for the defense budget to help Israel address problems regarding Iran. The budget changes came two months after Israel had approved its current two-year budget. The defense budget in 2009 stood at NIS 48.6 billion and NIS 53.2 billion for 2010 – the highest amount in Israel's history. The figure constituted 6.3% of expected gross domestic product and 15.1% of the overall budget, even before the planned NIS 1.5 billion addition.&lt;ref name=&quot;haaretz.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/defense-budget-to-grow-education-spending-to-shrink-1.6974 |title=Defense budget to grow, education spending to shrink |work=Haaretz |location=Israel |author=Moti Bassok |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2011, the prime minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] reversed course and moved to make significant cuts in the defense budget in order to pay for social programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/10/10/Israel-Generals-say-defense-cuts-perilous/UPI-60991318262603/ &quot;Israel: Generals say defense cuts perilous.&quot;] UPI, 10 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The General Staff concluded that the proposed cuts endangered the battle readiness of the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Harel, Amos.

However, Israel's spending per capita is below that of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by military expenditures]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Wikipedia is not a reliable source --&gt;

===Military technology===
The IDF possesses top-of-the-line weapons and computer systems. Some gear comes from the US (with some equipment modified for IDF use) such as the [[M4A1]] and [[M16 rifle|M16]] [[assault rifle]]s, the [[M24 SWS]] 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm [[bolt action]] [[sniper rifle]], the [[SR-25]] 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm semi-automatic sniper rifle, the [[F-15 Eagle]] and [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] [[warplane|fighter jets]], and the [[AH-1 Cobra]] and [[AH-64D Apache]] [[attack helicopter]]s. Israel has also developed its own independent weapons industry, which has developed weapons and vehicles such as the [[Merkava]] battle tank series, [[IAI Nesher|Nesher]] and [[Kfir]] [[fighter aircraft]], and various small arms such as the [[IMI Galil|Galil]] and [[Tavor]] [[assault rifle]]s, and the [[Uzi]] [[submachine gun]]. Israel has also installed a variant of the [[Samson RCWS]], a remote controlled weapons platform, which can include machine guns, grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles on a remotely operated turret, in [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]] along the [[Israeli Gaza Strip barrier]] intended to prevent [[Palestinian militant]]s from entering its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&amp;plckScript=blogscript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3A27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3A344244b3-3fee-4dfc-be03-992bf38a6f19 |title=Weaponized Sentry-Tech Towers Protecting Hot Borders |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/201007134943/israels-new-video-game-executions.html |title=Israel's New 'Video Game' Executions |work=Eurasia Review |author=Palestine Chronicle |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has developed observation [[Military ballooning|balloons]] equipped with sophisticated cameras and surveillance systems used to thwart terror attacks from Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4224907,00.html &quot;IDF observation balloon crashes near Gaza&quot;], Ynet News 5 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF also possesses advanced [[combat engineering]] equipment which include the [[IDF Caterpillar D9]] [[armored bulldozer]], [[IDF Puma]] [[Combat engineering vehicle|CEV]], [[Tzefa Shiryon]] and [[CARPET]] minefield breaching rockets, and a variety of [[robot]]s and explosive devices.

The IDF also has several large internal [[research and development]] departments, and it purchases many technologies produced by the Israeli security industries including [[Israel Aircraft Industries|IAI]], [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]], [[Elbit Systems]], [[Rafael Advanced Defense Systems|Rafael]], and dozens of smaller firms. Many of these developments have been battle-tested in Israel's numerous military engagements, making the relationship mutually beneficial, the IDF getting tailor-made solutions and the industries a good reputation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In response to the price overruns on the US [[Littoral Combat Ship]] program, Israel is considering producing their own [[warship]]s, which would take a decade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.trcb.com/news/israel/general/israel-navy-mulls-building-larger-scale-missile-ships-locally-12305.htm |title=Israel Navy mulls building larger-scale missile ships locally |work=The Jerusalem Post |author=Yaakov Katz |date=1 July 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and depend on diverting US financing to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yehudah Lev Kay |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/132104 |title=Navy Drops US Warship for Made-in-Israel Option |publisher=IsraelNationalNews.com |date=29 June 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main developments===
Israel's military technology is most famous for its firearms, [[armored fighting vehicles]] ([[tank]]s, tank-converted [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs), [[armoured bulldozer]]s, etc.), [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, and rocketry (missiles and rockets). Israel also has manufactured aircraft including the [[IAI Kfir|Kfir]] (reserve), [[IAI Lavi]] (canceled), and the [[IAI Phalcon]] [[Airborne early warning]] [[System]], and naval systems (patrol and missile ships). Much of the IDF's electronic systems (intelligence, communication, command and control, navigation etc.) are Israeli-developed, including many systems installed on foreign platforms (esp. aircraft, tanks and submarines), as are many of its [[precision-guided munition]]s. Israel is the world's largest exporter of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;

[[Israel Military Industries]] (IMI) is known for its firearms. The [[IMI Galil]], the [[Uzi]], the [[IMI Negev]] light machine gun and the new [[Tavor TAR-21]] Bullpup assault rifle are used by the IDF.

Israel is the only country in the world with an operational anti-ballistic missile defense system on the national level – the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow]] system, jointly funded and produced by Israel and the United States. The [[Iron Dome]] system against short-range [[rocket]]s is operational and proved to be successful. [[David's Sling]], an anti-missile system designed to counter [[Medium-range ballistic missile|medium range rocket]]s is under development. Israel has also worked with the US on development of a tactical high energy [[laser]] system against medium range rockets (called Nautilus or [[THEL]]).

Israel has the independent capability of launching [[reconnaissance satellites]] into orbit, a capability shared with Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, South Korea, Italy, Germany, the People's Republic of China, India, Japan, Brazil and Ukraine. Israeli security industries developed both the satellites ([[Ofeq]]) and the launchers ([[Shavit]]).

Israel is known to have developed [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fas-nuke&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/nuke/ |title=Nuclear Weapons – Israel |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel [[Policy of deliberate ambiguity|does not officially acknowledge]] its nuclear weapons program.

Brower notes that he is making a high estimate of the number of weapons.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that [[Jericho (missile)|Jericho intercontinental ballistic missiles]] are capable of delivering nuclear warheads with a superior degree of accuracy and a range of 11,500&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;cns.miis.edu&quot;&gt;[http://cns.miis.edu/opapers/op7/op7.pdf Missile Proliferation and Defences: Problems and Prospects].

==Commemoration==

===Commemoration===
{{See also|Yom Hazikaron}}
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 5670 war memorial in tel hashomer.jpg|thumb|An official IDF ceremony for Yom Hazikaron]]
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 12768 IDF parade in Jerusalem in 1968.jpg|thumb|Israeli female soldiers on parade, Jerusalem, 1968]]

[[Yom Hazikaron]], Israel's day of remembrance for fallen soldiers, is observed on the 4th day of the month of [[Iyar]] of the [[Hebrew calendar]], the day before the celebration of [[Yom Ha'atzmaut|Independence Day]]. Memorial services are held in the presence of Israel's top military personnel. A two-minute siren is heard at 11:00, which marks the opening of the official military memorial ceremonies and private remembrance gatherings at each cemetery where soldiers are buried. Many Israelis visit the graves of family members and friends who were killed in action. On the evening before the remembrance day all shops, restaurants and entertainment places must close gates to the public no later than 7 P.M. (the same routine and law applies to the day of remembrance of the Holocaust which takes place a week earlier).

The main museum for Israel's armored corps is the [[Yad La-Shiryon]] in [[Latrun]], which houses one of the largest tank museums in the world. Other significant military museums are the [[Israel Defense Forces History Museum]] (Batei Ha-Osef) in [[Tel Aviv]], the [[Palmach Museum]], and the Beit HaTotchan of artillery in [[Zikhron Ya'akov]]. The [[Israeli Air Force Museum]] is located at [[Hatzerim Airbase]] in the [[Negev Desert]], and the Israeli Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum, is in [[Haifa]].

Israel's National Military Cemetery is at [[Mount Herzl]]. Other Israeli military cemeteries include [[Kiryat Shaul Military Cemetery]] in Tel Aviv, and Sgula military cemetery at [[Petah Tikva]].

===Parades===
{{See also|Yom Ha'atzmaut|Israel Defense Forces parade}}
Israel Defense Forces parades took place on Independence Day, during the first 25 years of the State of Israel's existence. They were cancelled after 1973 due to financial and security concerns. The Israel Defense Forces still has weapon exhibitions country-wide on Independence Day, but they are stationary.

==Foreign military relations==

===France===
Starting on the Independence day on 14 May 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), a strong military, commercial and political relationship were established between France and Israel until 1969. The highest level of the military collaboration was reached between 1956 and 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bomb in the Basement: How Israel Went Nuclear and What That Means for the World |last1=Karpin |first1=Michael |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-7432-6595-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time France provided almost all the aircraft, tanks and military ships. In 1969 the French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] limited the export of weapons to Israel. This was the end of the &quot;golden age&quot; 20 years of relations between Israel and France.

===United States===

In 1983, the United States and Israel established a [[Joint Political Military Group]], which convenes twice a year. Both the U.S. and Israel participate in joint military planning and combined exercises, and have collaborated on military research and weapons development.

===United Kingdom===
{{Further|Israel – United Kingdom relations}}
During a secret operation in 1966, two British made &quot;Chieftain&quot; MBTs were brought to Israel for a 4 years long evaluation for service with the IDF. The plan was for the IDF not only to purchase the British MBTs, but for IMI (Israeli Military Industries) to buy production rights. As part of the deal during the early 60's Israel purchased second hand &quot;Centurion&quot; MBTs from the British, that used that money in the &quot;Chieftain&quot; development. After the trials were done Israeli improvement and ideas were implemented by the British manufacturer, but British politicians cancelled the agreement with Israel and the program was shut down. The knowledge earned during the improvements on the &quot;Chieftain&quot;, together with earlier experiments in tank improvements, gave the last push for the development and production of the &quot;Merkava&quot; tank.

United Kingdom has supplied equipment and spare parts for [[Sa'ar 4.5-class missile boat]]s and [[F-4 Phantom]] fighter-bombers, components for small-caliber artillery ammunition and air-to-surface missiles, and engines for [[Elbit Hermes 450]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]]s.

Israel and Greece have enjoyed a very cordial military relationship since 2008, including military drills ranging from Israel to the island of Crete. Drills include air-to-air long-distance refueling, long-range flights, and most importantly aiding Israel in outmaneuvering the [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] which Greece has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel goes all-out to stop S-300 sale to Iran|newspaper=PressTV|url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail.fa/78623.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent purchases include 100 million euro deal between Greece and Israel for the purchase of [[Spice (guidance kit)|SPICE]] 1000 and SPICE 2000 pound bomb kits. They have also signed many defense agreements, including Cyprus, in order to establish stability for transporting gas from Israel-Cyprus to Greece and on to the European Union-a paramount objective to the future stability and prosperity of all three countries, threatened by Turkey.

===Turkey===
{{Further|Israel–Turkey relations}}
Israel has provided extensive military assistance to Turkey. Israel sold Turkey [[IAI Heron]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, and modernized Turkey's [[F-4 Phantom]] and [[Northrop F-5]] aircraft at the cost of $900 million. Turkey's [[main battle tank]] is the Israeli-made [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra]] tank, of which Turkey has 170. Israel later upgraded them for $500 million. Israel has also supplied Turkey with Israeli-made missiles, and the two nations have engaged in naval cooperation.

The Israeli Army is phasing out the M-16 rifle from all ground units in favor of the [[IMI Tavor]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Post: ''IDF phasing out M-16 in favor of Israeli-made Tavor'' (19 December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the IDF is now replacing its outdated [[M113 armored personnel carrier]]s in favor of new [[Namer]] APCs, with 200 ordered in 2014, the [[Eitan AFV]], and is upgrading its [[IDF Achzarit]] APCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/article/51098/israel-to-upgrade-more-achzarit-apcs|title=Israel to upgrade more Achzarit APCs|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4573814,00.html|title=Ya'alon approves addition of 200 advanced APCs for the IDF|work=ynet|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF also announced plans to streamline its military bureaucracy so as to better maintain its reserve force, which a 2014 State Comptroller report noted was under-trained and may not be able to fulfill wartime missions. As part of the plans, 100,000 reservists and will be discharged, and training for the remainder will be improved. The officer corps will be slashed by 5,000. In addition, infantry and light artillery brigades will be reduced to increase training standards among the rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4639799,00.html|title=IDF to create smaller, better-trained reserve force|work=ynet|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backbone of the IDF Artillery Corps, the [[M109 howitzer]], will be phased out in favor of a still-undecided replacement, with the [[ATMOS 2000]] and [[Artillery Gun Module]] under primary consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armyrecognition.com/october_2013_defense_industry_military_news_uk/israel_army_wants_to_replace_old_155mm_howitzer_m109_with_soltam_or_agm_artillery_system_3010134.html|title=Israel Army wants to replace old 155mm howitzer M109 with Soltam or AGM artillery system 3010134 - October 2013 defense industry military news UK - Military army defense industry news year 2013|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF is also planning a future tank to replace the Merkava. The new tank will be able to fire lasers and electromagnetic pulses, run on a hybrid engine, run with a crew as small as two, will be faster, and will be better-protected, with emphasis on protection systems such as the Trophy over armor.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Post: ''The IDF's future tank: Electromagnetic cannon''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-to-discharge-100000-reservists-slash-officer-corps/|title=IDF to discharge 100,000 reservists, slash officer corps|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Israeli Air Force]] will purchase as many as 100 [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35 Lightning II]] fighter jets from the United States. The aircraft will be modified and designated F-35I. They will use Israeli-built electronic warfare systems, outer-wings, guided bombs, and air-to-air missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/lockheed-awarded-207-million-contract-to-incorporate-israeli-specific-f-35-systems-375899/ |title=Lockheed awarded $207 million contract to incorporate Israeli-specific F-35 systems |publisher=Flightglobal.com |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news/awst/2010/08/23/AW_08_23_2010_p32-249396.xml ] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/158594#.UTPFZzCG0j4 |title=Panetta’s Visit Sealed F-35 Jet Sale to Israel |publisher=Israel National News |date= |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a 2013 arms deal, the IAF will purchase [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135 Stratotanker]] aerial refueling aircraft and [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey|V-22 Osprey]] multi-mission aircraft from the United States, as well as advanced radars for warplanes and missiles designed to take out radars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4369684,00.html |title=Israel to buy new missiles, refueling planes from US |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, an Israeli official stated that within 40–50 years, piloted aircraft would be phased out of service by [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] capable of executing nearly any operation that can be performed by piloted combat aircraft. Israel's military industries are reportedly on the path to developing such technology in a few decades. Israel will also manufacture tactical satellites for military use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4370514,00.html |title=Israel says drones to eventually replace manned aircraft |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Israeli Navy]] is currently expanding its submarine fleet, with a planned total of six [[Dolphin class submarine]]s. Currently, five have been delivered, with the sixth expected in 2017. It is also upgrading and expanding its surface fleet. It is planning to upgrade the electronic warfare systems of its [[Sa'ar 5-class corvette]]s and [[Sa'ar 4.5 class missile boat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/naval/ships/2015/06/28/israel-navy-to-upgrade-combat-surface-fleet-saar/29277241/|title=Israel Navy To Upgrade Combat Surface Fleet|date=28 June 2015|work=Defense News|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has ordered two new classes of warship: the [[Sa'ar 6-class corvette]] (a variant of the [[Braunschweig-class corvette]]) and the [[Sa'ar 72-class corvette]] (an improved and enlarged version of the Sa'ar 4.5-class). It plans to acquire four Saar 6-class corvettes and three Sa'ar 72-class corvettes.
