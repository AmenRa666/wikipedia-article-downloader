'''Peter Frank King''' (b. [[Caxton, Cambridgeshire]], 30 October 1916, d. [[Lake Wahapo]], near [[Whataroa]], New Zealand, 12 December 1962) was a British [[Commando]] in [[World War II]], who was [[field commission|commissioned in the field]] and awarded the [[Military Cross]].&lt;ref name=jd98 /&gt; He also served in [[Korea]] with the [[New Zealand Army]], being awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in 1951. King died in a car accident in 1962.&lt;ref name=nzdf&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Peter King and Derek Rixon |work=Army News |publisher=[[New Zealand Defence Force]] |date=10 April 2007 |url=http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/news/publications/army-news/374/pkanddr.htm |doi= |accessdate=21 Feb 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519190953/http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/news/publications/army-news/374/pkanddr.htm |archivedate=May 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Peter King was born in Caxton, Cambridgeshire; his parents were William Edgar King, a [[master builder (occupation)|master builder]], and his wife, Hilda May Pleasants. He was educated at [[Truro School]].&lt;ref name=dnzb&gt;{{cite web

==World War II service==
King joined the [[Royal Army Dental Corps|Dental Corps]] in March 1939 and served as a non-technician, excelling as a weapons instructor. He spent two years in this role, rapidly becoming a drill sergeant at the Dental Corps' depot, but then applied to transfer to a fighting unit. This was refused. King was so frustrated that he and another soldier,  Pte [[Leslie Cuthbertson]], then 20 and from [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] took matters in their own hands; they planned and executed an unofficial and unauthorised raid on [[occupied France]].&lt;ref name=jd98&gt;Dunning, pp.98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1942, the two men stole weapons and grenades and also a motor-boat from the south west of England. They landed in France, where they attempted to cut a railway line using a [[hand grenade]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;Some accounts, e.g. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/alt_essayBody.asp?essayID=5K10]&lt;/sup&gt;, say that King and Cuthbertson attacked, or attempted to derail, a troop train.&lt;/ref&gt; among other activities. After three days, King and Cuthbertson stole a French motor boat to return to England. This failed and they were adrift in the Channel for twelve days until picked up by an [[Air-sea rescue#Military operations|Air Sea Rescue Service]] launch.&lt;ref group=note&gt;A New Zealand source&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.rnza.co.nz/artillery_heritage/korean_war/kwar/peter_king.htm]&lt;/sup&gt; states that the two men were 15 days adrift and that they were picked up by a Royal Navy destroyer.&lt;/ref&gt; They were initially treated as spies.&lt;ref name=jd98 /&gt;

Both men were [[court-martial]]led in July 1942. King lost his sergeant's rank but he was posted to the [[Commando]] training base at [[Achnacarry]], as a [[Private (rank)|private]] on [[Detachment (military)|detachment]] from the [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]]. After training, he was allocated to [[No. 4 Commando]], on the request of its commander, [[Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat|15th Lord Lovat]] who had heard of his French adventures. King was a highly successful recruit to the Commandos, becoming [[Troop Sergeant Major]] of C Troop before the [[D Day]] landings.&lt;ref name=jd98 /&gt;

No. 4 Commando landed at [[La Brèche]], near [[Ouistreham]] early on D Day, and they were detailed to fight through and link up with the airborne troops who had captured vital canal bridges ([[Operation Pegasus|Operation ''Pegasus'']]).&lt;ref name=dnzb /&gt; King was prominent in the fighting in Normandy and during further distinguished actions in [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] on [[Walcheren Island]], during the [[Battle of the Scheldt]], he was commissioned in the field (becoming a [[2nd Lieutenant]], later attaining the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]]).&lt;ref name=jd98 /&gt; He was subsequently awarded the Military Cross for crossing into enemy territory on [[Schouwen]] from [[North Beveland]], for three days' reconnaissance and artillery &quot;spotting&quot;. His unit's War Diary records that &quot;during this period the patrol managed to cover most of the area allotted to it, artillery fire was successfully directed on to certain targets and on groups of Germans when seen grouped together in the open&quot;.&lt;ref name=jd193&gt;Dunning, pp.193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuthbertson's and King's exploits were told in a book, ''The Amateur Commandos'', and a film, [[Two Men Went to War]], was based on them.&lt;ref name=jd98 /&gt;

==New Zealand==
King emigrated to [[New Zealand]] in 1946 and worked as a factory manager in [[Christchurch]] and as a [[The bush|bushman]] at [[Otautau]], [[Southland Region|Southland]].&lt;ref name=dnzb /&gt; He joined the New Zealand Army in November 1950 for war service in Korea ([[Kayforce]]).&lt;ref name=lf /&gt;

In November, 1951, King—now a Captain with the 16th Field Regiment, [[Royal New Zealand Artillery]]—and a signaller, Gunner Derek Rixon, manned a forward artillery [[observation post]] (OP) for New Zealand artillery supporting a company of [[The King's Own Scottish Borderers]] on [[Hill 355]]. The first large scale Chinese attack was broken up by the guns but, when their OP's communications were cut, the two men joined in the close-quarters defence of the hill, each becoming wounded. After two hours, the position was abandoned and Rixon carried King to safety. For his &quot;tenacity, commitment and courage&quot;, King was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Rixon received the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] for his &quot;fine example of courage, commitment and comradeship while fighting alongside his officer&quot;.&lt;ref name=nzdf /&gt; King was described as &quot;the genius of gunner observers&quot; by a Scottish infantryman.&lt;ref name=dnzb /&gt;

From July to September 1952, King commanded 161st Battery before his return to New Zealand.&lt;ref name=dnzb /&gt;

Out of the Army, King returned to the South Island, working at [[Te Anau]] as a trail guide. Late in 1954, he was selected to join the [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] in [[Kashmir]] and he was commissioned as a [[Major]] in the regular Army. Between 1956 and 1959,&lt;ref name=lf /&gt; King served on the [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir cease-fire]] line based at [[Srinagar]].&lt;ref name=dnzb /&gt;

King married Dorothy Woodham Graham on 18 April 1959 at [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]]; she was a postmistress and daughter of the well-known alpine guide [[Alec Graham]]. The couple subsequently had a son and a daughter.&lt;ref name=dnzb /&gt; He retired from the Army in 1960 &lt;ref name=nzdf /&gt; and worked for the [[New Zealand Forest Service]] at Otautau&lt;ref name=dnzb /&gt; before being appointed as the first Chief Park Ranger of [[Westland National Park]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=nzdf /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Apparently reliable sources conflict on the dates of King's life from 1959 until his death. The text attempts to reconcile these.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter King drowned on 12 December 1962. He was travelling to a meeting in [[Hokitika]] when his car, out of control, went into Lake Wahapo, [[Westland District|South Westland]]. He is buried at [[Whataroa]], South Westland.&lt;ref name=lf&gt;{{cite web
