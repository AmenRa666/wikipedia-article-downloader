Brigadier General '''Ignatius Slamet Rijadi''' ([[EYD|Perfected Spelling]]: '''Ignatius Slamet Riyadi'''; 26 July 1927&amp;nbsp;– 4 November 1950) was an Indonesian soldier.

Rijadi was born in [[Surakarta]], [[Central Java]], to a soldier and a fruit seller. &quot;Sold&quot; to his uncle and renamed as a toddler to cure his illnesses, Rijadi was raised at his parents' home and studied at Dutch-run schools. After the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] of the [[Dutch East Indies]], Rijadi studied at a Japanese-run sailor's academy and worked for them upon graduation; he abandoned the Japanese army towards the end of World {{nowrap|War II}} and assisted resistance operations for the rest of the occupation.

After [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia's independence]] on 17 August 1945, Rijadi led Indonesian forces in the Surakarta area during the [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]] against the returning Dutch. Starting with a guerrilla campaign, by 1947, when he fought against Dutch offensives in [[Ambarawa]] and [[Semarang]], he was in charge of the 26th Regiment. During a [[Operation Kraai|second Dutch offensive]], Rijadi lost control of the city but soon retook it, later leading counter-offensives in [[West Java]]. In 1950, after the end of the revolution, Rijadi was sent to the [[Moluccas]] to put down a rebellion. After several months of planning and a month crossing [[Ambon Island]], Rijadi was killed near the end of the operation by a rebounding bullet.

Since his death, Rijadi has received much recognition. The main street in Surakarta is named after him, as is a [[frigate]] in the [[Indonesian Navy]], the KRI ''Slamet Riyadi''. Awarded several medals in 1961 posthumously, Rijadi was given the title of [[National Hero of Indonesia]] on 9 November 2007.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rijadi was born with the name Soekamto in [[Surakarta]], [[Central Java]], [[Dutch East Indies]], on 26 July 1927;{{sfn|Ajisaka|Damayanti|2010|p=263}} he was the second son born to Underlieutenant Raden Ngabehi Prawiropralebdo, an officer in the sultan's army, and Soetati, a fruit seller.{{sfn|Pringgodigdo|Shadily|1973|p=1024}}{{sfn|Pour|2008|p=13}} When Soekamto was one year old, his mother dropped him; he afterwards became frequently ill. To help cure his illness, his family &quot;sold&quot; him in a traditional [[Javanese people|Javanese]] ritual to his uncle, Warnenhardjo; after the ceremony, Soekamto's name was changed to Slamet. Although formally Warnenhardjo's son after the ceremony, Slamet was raised at his parents' house.{{sfn|Pour|2008|pp=15–16}} The family was Roman Catholic, but Rijadi studied [[Javanese mysticism|mysticism]] from a young age.{{sfn|Pringgodigdo|Shadily|1973|p=1024}}

Rijadi's primary education was done at Dutch-run schools. His elementary school was taken at the Hollandsch-Inlandsche School Ardjoeno, a private school owned and run by a Dutch religious group.{{sfn|Pour|2008|pp=15–16}} While at Mangkoenegaran Middle School, where numerous students were named Slamet, he received an additional name, Rijadi;{{sfn|Pour|2008|p=19}} it is also during middle school that his father bought him back.{{sfn|Pour|2008|pp=15–16}} After middle school and the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in 1942, he attended a sailor's academy in Jakarta. After graduation, he worked as navigator on a wooden ship.{{sfn|Ajisaka|Damayanti|2010|p=263}}{{sfn|Pour|2008|p=20}}

Rijadi, who when not at sea lived in a dormitory near [[Gambir Station]] in [[Central Jakarta]], occasionally met with underground resistance.{{sfn|Pour|2008|p=21}} On 14 February 1945, with Japan facing defeat in World {{nowrap|War II}}, Rijadi and other sailors abandoned their dormitory and took up arms; Rijadi moved back to Surakarta and supported resistance movements there.{{sfn|Pour|2008|p=22}} He was not captured by the [[Kempeitai|Japanese military police]] or other units for the remainder of the occupation, which ended with Indonesia's independence on 17 August 1945.{{sfn|Ajisaka|Damayanti|2010|p=263}}

===National revolution===
After the Japanese surrender, the Dutch attempted to re-occupy the newly declared Republic of Indonesia; unwilling to be colonised, the Indonesians [[Indonesian National Revolution|fought back]]. Rijadi began a guerrilla campaign against Dutch posts and quickly rose through the ranks.{{sfn|Ajisaka|Damayanti|2010|p=263}} He was in charge of the 26th Regiment in Surakarta. During [[Operation Product]], a general offensive by Dutch forces in mid-1947, Rijadi led Indonesian forces in several parts of Central Java, including [[Ambarawa]] and [[Semarang]]; he also led a cleansing force between mounts [[Mount Merapi|Merapi]] and [[Merbabu]].{{sfn|Pringgodigdo|Shadily|1973|p=1024}}

In September 1948 Rijadi was promoted and given control of four battalions of soldiers and one of student soldiers. Two months later, the Dutch [[Operation Kraai|launched a second attack]], this time on the nearby city of [[Yogyakarta]] (then serving as the nation's capital). Although Rijadi and his troops launched attacks on Dutch forces approaching Solo through [[Klaten]], ultimately the Dutch soldiers entered the city. Applying a [[defeat in detail|divide and conquer]] policy, Rijadi was able to drive the forces out in four days.{{sfn|Pringgodigdo|Shadily|1973|p=1024}}

During the remainder of the war, Rijadi was sent to [[West Java]] to fight against [[Raymond Westerling]]'s [[Legion of Ratu Adil]].{{sfn|Pringgodigdo|Shadily|1973|p=1025}}

===Later life and death===
[[File:Kawilarang and Rijadi Harian Umum 27 November 1950 p1.jpg|thumb|Rijadi (right) and [[Alexander Evert Kawilarang]] discussing strategy in Ambon]]
Not long after the end of the war, the [[Republic of South Maluku]] (RMS) declared its independence from the nascent Indonesia. Rijadi was sent to the frontline on 10 July 1950 as part of [[Operation Senopati]].{{sfn|Pringgodigdo|Shadily|1973|p=1025}}{{sfn|Pour|2008|p=8}} To retake the [[Ambon Island|island of Ambon]], Rijadi took half his forces and invaded the eastern shores, while the other half was tasked with invading from the northern coast. Although the second group experienced heavy resistance, Rijadi's group was able to take to the beach in native canoes unopposed; they later landed more infantry and armour.{{sfn|Conboy|2003|p=9}}

On 3 October, the troops, along with Colonel [[Alexander Evert Kawilarang]], were tasked with capturing the rebel capital at [[Ambon, Maluku|New Victoria]]. Rijadi and Kawilarang led a three pronged assault, with forces approaching by land from the north and east, and naval forces pulling directly into Ambon harbour. Rijadi's forces approached the city through mangrove swamps,{{sfn|Conboy|2003|p=9}} a journey which took a month. During the trip, RMS snipers armed with [[Jungle Carbine]]s and [[Owen Gun]]s shot constantly at the troops, often pinning them down.{{sfn|Conboy|2003|p=10}}{{sfn|Pour|2008|p=12}}

Upon arriving in New Victoria, Rijadi's forces made short work of the RMS troops. However, he did not see the end of the battle. As Rijadi was riding atop a tank towards the final rebel stronghold on 4 November, a volley of machine gun fire erupted in his direction. A single bullet rebounded off the tank's armour and into Rijadi's abdomen. After being rushed to a [[hospital ship]], Rijadi insisted on returning to the front; instead, the doctors gave him much morphine and attempted unsuccessfully to treat the gun wound. Rijadi died that night; the battle ended the same day. {{sfn|Pringgodigdo|Shadily|1973|p=1025}}{{sfn|Conboy|2003|p=10}} Rijadi was buried in Ambon.{{sfn|Pringgodigdo|Shadily|1973|p=1025}}

==Legacy==

Numerous things have been named after Rijadi. The {{convert|5.8|km|mi|adj=on}} long main road of Surakarta is named after the brigadier general.{{sfn|Ayuningtyas 2011, Surakarta offers car-free}} The KRI ''Slamet Riyadi'', a [[frigate]] described as one of the most sophisticated in the [[Indonesian Navy]], is named after him.{{sfn|Erviani and Lilley 2011, Bali maritime security}}

Rijadi has received numerous awards. He received several medals posthumously, including the Bintang Sakti in May 1961, the Bintang Gerilya in July 1961, and the Satya Lencana Bakti in November 1961.{{sfn|Pringgodigdo|Shadily|1973|p=1025}} On 9 November 2007, President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] gave Rijadi the title [[National Hero of Indonesia]];{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2007, Four forgotten independence}} Rijadi received the title along with [[Adnan Kapau Gani]], [[Ida Anak Agung Gde Agung]], and [[Moestopo]] based on Presidential Decree Number 66 / TK of 2007.{{sfn|Suara Merdeka 2007, Presiden Anugerahkan Gelar}}
