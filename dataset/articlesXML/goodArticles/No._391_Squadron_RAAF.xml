'''No. 391 (Base) Squadron''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] that operated during the [[Korean War]] and its immediate aftermath. It was established in October 1950 as part of [[No. 91 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;91 (Composite) Wing]], which administered RAAF units deployed in the conflict. Apart from No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron, these included [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 (Fighter) Squadron]], No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit (redesignated [[No. 30 Transport Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30 Transport Unit]] in 1951 and [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;36 (Transport) Squadron]] in 1953), and [[No. 491 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;491 (Maintenance) Squadron]].  No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron was headquartered at [[Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni|Iwakuni]], Japan, as were {{nowrap|No. 91 Wing's}} other components with the exception of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, which was located on the Korean peninsula. The base squadron was responsible for administrative, logistical, medical, communications and security functions at Iwakuni, and also maintained detachments in South Korea. It included a marine section for harbour patrols and search-and-rescue in the waters off southern Japan. No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron was disbanded at the same time as {{nowrap|No. 91 Wing}} headquarters, in April 1955.

==History==
When the [[Korean War]] broke out on 25&amp;nbsp;June 1950, [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 (Fighter) Squadron]] of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) was based at [[Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni|Iwakuni]], Japan. For the previous four years the squadron, equipped with [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s, had served with the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Personnel were preparing to return to Australia when they were placed on standby for action over Korea; the squadron began flying missions as part of [[United Nations]] (UN) forces a week later.&lt;ref name=Solo222&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 222–225&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Battle of Inchon|landing at Inchon]] and the consequent advance northward of UN troops, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron relocated to [[Pohang Airport|Pohang]], South Korea, on 12&amp;nbsp;October 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt; It left behind its main support elements at Iwakuni.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; No. 91 (Composite) Wing was established at the base on 20&amp;nbsp;October and given administrative responsibility for all RAAF units operating during the conflict.&lt;ref name=Korean314&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APDC91WG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=404|title=No 91 (Composite) Wing formed in Japan|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron and three newly formed components: No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Flight (renamed No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit the following month, [[No. 30 Transport Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30 Transport Unit]] in November 1951 and [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;36 (Transport) Squadron]] in March 1953), [[No. 491 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;491 (Maintenance) Squadron]], and No.&amp;nbsp;391 (Base) Squadron.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=APDC91WG/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name=Solo228&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 228–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Transport150&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, the wing's units were all headquartered at Iwakuni.&lt;ref name=Solo228/&gt;

At the onset of war in Korea, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron was self-supporting, the largest flying unit in the RAAF.&lt;ref name=OBrien58&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised 299 officers and men, 40 Mustangs, 3 [[CAC Wirraway]]s, 2 [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]] and 2 [[Auster]]s.&lt;ref name=Solo222/&gt; The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea, leading to the formation of No.&amp;nbsp;391 (Base) Squadron at Iwakuni, at the same time as No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing headquarters.&lt;ref name=OBrien58/&gt; RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative, logistical, medical, communications and security functions.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Staffed mainly by former No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron members, in the first year of its existence No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron had to try to overcome severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment.&lt;ref name=OBrien58/&gt; Further problems arose when No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron converted to [[Gloster Meteor]]s between April and July 1951, as spares for the British-made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang.&lt;ref name=Solo231&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 231–233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OBrien59&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; No longer could No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron source parts from the US [[Fifth Air Force]] as it had up till this point.&lt;ref name=OBrien59/&gt; Disposal of the Mustangs and their spares also caused headaches; the process took two years, causing storage issues.&lt;ref name=OBrien58/&gt; The base squadron faced another challenge in January 1952, following a controversial change in role for the Meteors, from air-to-air combat to ground attack, which necessitated obtaining supplies of rockets and modification of the aircraft to carry them.&lt;ref name=OBrien60&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:No. 91 Wing RAAF Transit Hotel (AWM P03065.001).JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.40|Staff of No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing's &quot;Transit Hotel&quot; at Iwakuni, run by No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron, c.&amp;nbsp;April 1953|alt=Four rows of people, mostly in civilian clothes, some in military dress, in front of a building marked &quot;Transit Hotel&quot;]]
Along with its RAAF responsibilities, No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron supported [[Australian Army]] and other UN personnel travelling through Iwakuni.&lt;ref name=OBrien60/&gt; It ran No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing's &quot;Transit Hotel&quot;, which accommodated business people and entertainers, as well as military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article78896684 |title=World's most unusual hotel |newspaper=Nambour Chronicle and North Coast Advertiser |date=18 September 1953 |accessdate=22 October 2014 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron maintained two detachments in South Korea, one at [[Gimpo International Airport|Kimpo Air Base]] to handle Meteor spares, and another at the RAAF ward of the British Commonwealth Zone Medical Unit in [[Seoul]]. Base support staff regularly rotated from Iwakuni to these detachments. No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron's medical contingent was heavily engaged in the preparation and escort of injured personnel from Korea to Iwakuni and then to other destinations.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The unit included a marine craft section equipped with small boats that patrolled harbours in southern Japan used by British and American flying boats, and conducted search-and-rescue operations for UN pilots who ditched at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64431685 |title=The RAAF goes to sea |newspaper=[[Portland Guardian]] |date=2 June 1952 |accessdate=30 October 2014 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron used Japanese technicians as well as Australian, which was unusual at the time; since the [[occupation of Japan]] following its surrender in World War&amp;nbsp;II, Japanese workers had only been employed for menial tasks.&lt;ref name=Korean314/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the departure for Australia of Nos.&amp;nbsp;77 and 36 Squadrons between November 1954 and March 1955, and the disbandment of No.&amp;nbsp;491 Squadron in December 1954, No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron disbanded on 30&amp;nbsp;April 1955, the same day as No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing headquarters.&lt;ref name=Korea592&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 592&lt;/ref&gt;
