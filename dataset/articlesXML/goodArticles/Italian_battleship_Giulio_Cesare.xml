'''''Giulio Cesare''''' was one of three {{sclass-|Conte di Cavour|battleship|0}} [[dreadnought battleship]]s built for the Royal Italian Navy (''[[Regia Marina]]'') in the 1910s. She served in both [[World War]]s, although she was little used and saw no combat during the former. The ship supported operations during the [[Corfu Incident]] in 1923 and spent much of the rest of the decade in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. She was rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before.

Both ''Giulio Cesare'' and her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Italian battleship|Conte di Cavour||2}}, participated in the [[Battle of Calabria]] in July 1940, when the former was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers [[Battle of Taranto|attacked]] the fleet at [[Taranto]] in November 1940, but ''Giulio Cesare'' was not damaged. She escorted several convoys to North Africa and participated in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] in late 1940 and the [[First Battle of Sirte]] in late 1941. She was designated as a [[training ship]] in early 1942, and escaped to [[Malta]] after Italy surrendered. The ship was transferred to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1949 and renamed '''''Novorossiysk'''''. The Soviets also used her for training until she was sunk when an old German [[naval mine|mine]] exploded in 1955. She was [[Marine salvage|salvaged]] the following year and later [[ship breaking|scrapped]].

==Description==
Named after [[Julius Caesar]], ''Giulio Cesare'' was {{convert|168.9|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]], and {{convert|176|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]]. The ship had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28|m|ftin|sp=us}}, and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.3|m|ftin|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=randal259&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; She displaced {{convert|23088|LT|t}} at normal load, and {{convert|25086|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. She had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men.&lt;ref name=g02&gt;Giorgerini, pp. 270, 272&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's machinery consisted of four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. Steam for the turbines was provided by 24 [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler]]s, half of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other half burning both oil and coal. Designed to reach a maximum speed of {{convert|22.5|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|31000|shp|lk=in}}, ''Giulio Cesare'' failed to reach this goal on her [[sea trial]]s, despite generally exceeding the rated power of her turbines. The ship only made a maximum speed of {{convert|21.56|kn}} using {{convert|30700|shp|abbr=on}}. She had a cruising radius of {{convert|4800|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=randal259/&gt;

The ship was armed with a main battery of thirteen {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} guns in three triple-[[gun turret]] and two twin-gun turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. The secondary battery comprised eighteen {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} guns, all mounted in [[casemate]]s in the sides of the hull. ''Giulio Cesare'' was also armed with fourteen {{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} guns. As was customary for [[capital ship]]s of the period, she was equipped with three submerged {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s. She was protected with [[Krupp cemented armour|Krupp cemented steel]] manufactured by [[Terni]]. The [[belt armor]] was {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} thick and the main deck was {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] and main battery turrets were protected with {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on}} worth of armor plating.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgerini, pp. 271–72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modifications and reconstruction==
[[File:ONI Drawing of Conte di Cavour-class battleship.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Office of Naval Intelligence]] drawing of the ''Conte di Cavour'' class, January 1943]]
Shortly after the end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76&amp;nbsp;mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76&amp;nbsp;mm [[Anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]] were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two [[license-built]] [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|2-pounder]] AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s,&lt;ref name=g7&gt;Giorgerini, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; the [[rangefinder]]s were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a [[Macchi M.18]] [[seaplane]] mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, either one or both of the ships was equipped with a fixed [[aircraft catapult]] on the port side of the forecastle.{{#tag:ref|Sources disagree if ''Giulio Cesare'' was fitted with a catapult or not. Giorgerini says both ships received one;&lt;ref name=g7/&gt; Whitley, Bagnasco &amp; Grossman and Bargoni &amp; Gay say that only ''Conte di Cavour'' received one.&lt;ref name=w8&gt;Whitley, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb4&gt;Bagnasco &amp; Grossman, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bargoni &amp; Gay, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

''Giulio Cesare'' began an extensive reconstruction in October 1933 at the [[Cantiere navale di Riva Trigoso|Cantieri del Tirreno]] shipyard in [[Genoa]] that lasted until October 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bargoni19&quot;&gt;Bargoni &amp; Gay, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; A new bow section was grafted over the existing bow which increased her length by {{convert|10.31|m|ftin|sp=us}} to {{convert|186.4|m|ftin|sp=us}} and her beam increased to {{convert|28.6|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The ship's draft at deep load increased to {{convert|10.02|m|ftin|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=eb4/&gt; All of the changes made increased her displacement to {{convert|26140|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|29100|LT|t}} at deep load. The ship's crew increased to 1,260 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref&gt;Brescia, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the propeller shafts were removed and the existing turbines were replaced by two Belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at {{convert|75000|shp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=eb4/&gt; The boilers were replaced by eight [[Yarrow boiler]]s. On her sea trials in December 1936, before her reconstruction was fully completed, ''Giulio Cesare'' reached a speed of {{convert|28.24|kn}} from {{convert|93430|shp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin 2003, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; In service her maximum speed was about {{convert|27|kn}} and she had a range of {{convert|6400|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|13|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnasco &amp; Grossman, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

The main guns were bored out to {{convert|320|mm|in|sp=us|1}} and the center turret and the torpedo tubes were removed. All of the existing secondary armament and AA guns were replaced by a dozen 120&amp;nbsp;mm guns in six twin-gun turrets and eight {{convert|102|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} AA guns in twin turrets. In addition the ship was fitted with a dozen [[Società Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] [[Cannone-Mitragliera da 37/54 (Breda)|{{convert|37|mm|sp=us|adj=on|1}}]] light AA guns in six twin-gun mounts and twelve {{convert|13.2|mm|sp=us|adj=on|2}} Breda M31 anti-aircraft [[machine gun]]s, also in twin mounts.&lt;ref name=eb5&gt;Bagnasco &amp; Grossman, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 the 13.2&amp;nbsp;mm machine guns were replaced by {{convert|20|mm|sp=us|adj=on|1}} AA guns in twin mounts. ''Giulio Cesare'' received two more twin mounts as well as four additional 37&amp;nbsp;mm guns in twin mounts on the forecastle between the two turrets in 1941.&lt;ref name=w8/&gt;&lt;ref name=w8/&gt; The tetrapodal mast was replaced with a new forward conning tower, protected with {{convert|260|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on|1}} thick armor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bargoni21&quot;&gt;Bargoni &amp; Gay, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Atop the conning tower there was a [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control director]] fitted with two large stereo-rangefinders, with a base length of {{convert|7.2|m|sp=us|1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bargoni21&quot;/&gt;

The deck armor was increased during the reconstruction to a total of {{convert|135|mm|in|sp=us}} over the engine and boiler rooms and {{convert|166|mm|in|sp=us}} over the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s, although its distribution over three decks, each with multiple layers, meant that it was considerably less effective than a single plate of the same thickness. The armor protecting the barbettes was reinforced with {{convert|50|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} plates.&lt;ref name=m12/&gt; All this armor weighed a total of {{convert|3227|LT|t}}.&lt;ref name=w8/&gt; The existing underwater protection was replaced by the [[Pugliese torpedo defense system]] that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo [[warhead]]. It lacked, however, enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ship's increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.&lt;ref name=m12&gt;McLaughlin 2003, pp. 421–22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and service==
[[File:Sestri Ponente - Launch of Giulio Cesare.jpg|thumb|left|Launch of ''Gulio Cesare'', 15 October, 1911.]]
[[File:GiulioCesare1914.jpg|thumb|left|''Gulio Cesare'' shortly after completion, 1914]]
''Giulio Cesare'', named after [[Julius Caesar]],&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Keel|laid down]] at the [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.]] shipyard in Genoa on 24 June 1910 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 October 1911. She was completed on 14 May 1914 and served as a [[flagship]] in the southern [[Adriatic Sea]] during World War I.&lt;ref name=s7&gt;Preston, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; She saw no action, however, and spent little time at sea.&lt;ref name=g7/&gt; Admiral [[Paolo Thaon di Revel]], the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian [[submarine]]s and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halpern, p. 150&quot;&gt;Halpern, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The threat from these underwater weapons to his [[capital ship]]s was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halpern, p. 150&quot;/&gt; Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the [[MAS (boat)|MAS torpedo boats]], conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 141&amp;ndash;142&lt;/ref&gt;

''Giulio Cesare'' made port visits in the [[Levant]] in 1919 and 1920. Both ''Giulio Cesare'' and ''Conte di Cavour'' supported Italian operations on [[Corfu]] in 1923 after an Italian general and his staff [[Corfu incident|were murdered on Corfu]]; [[Benito Mussolini]] was not satisfied with the Greek government's response so he ordered Italian troops to occupy the island. ''Cesare'' became a gunnery training ship in 1928, after having been in reserve since 1926. She was reconstructed at [[Cantieri del Tirreno]], Genoa, between 1933 and 1937. Both ships participated in a naval review by [[Adolf Hitler]] in the [[Bay of Naples]] in May 1938 and covered the [[invasion of Albania]] in May 1939.&lt;ref name=w1&gt;Whitley, pp. 158–61&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
{{main|Battle of Calabria}}
Early in World War II, the ship took part in the Battle of Calabria (also known as the Battle of Punto Stilo), together with ''Conte di Cavour'', on 9 July 1940, as part of the 1st Battle Squadron, commanded by Admiral [[Inigo Campioni]], during which she engaged major elements of the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]]. The British were escorting a convoy from Malta to [[Alexandria]], while the Italians had finished escorting another from [[Naples]] to [[Benghazi]], Libya. Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, attempted to interpose his ships between the Italians and their base at Taranto. Crew on the fleets spotted each other in the middle of the afternoon and the battleships opened fire at 15:53 at a range of nearly {{convert|29000|yd|disp=flip|sp=us}}. The two leading British battleships, {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} and {{HMS|Malaya||2}}, replied a minute later. Three minutes after she opened fire, shells from ''Giulio Cesare'' began to straddle ''Warspite'' which made a small turn and increased speed, to throw off the Italian ship's aim, at 16:00. At that same time, a shell from ''Warspite'' struck ''Giulio Cesare'' at a distance of about {{convert|26000|yd|disp=flip|sp=us}}. The shell pierced the rear funnel and detonated inside it, blowing out a hole nearly {{convert|20|ft|m|disp=flip|sp=us}} across. Fragments started several fires and their smoke was drawn into the boiler rooms, forcing four boilers off-line as their operators could not breathe. This reduced the ship's speed to {{convert|18|kn}}. Uncertain how severe the damage was, Campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in the face of superior British numbers and they successfully disengaged.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, pp. 28–35&lt;/ref&gt; Repairs to ''Giulio Cesare'' were completed by the end of August and both ships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept British convoys to [[Malta]] in August and September.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 11 November 1940, ''Giulio Cesare'' and the other Italian battleships were at anchor in Taranto harbor when they were attacked by 21 [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from the British [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Illustrious|R87|6}}, along with several other warships. One torpedo sank [[Italian battleship Conte di Cavour|Conte di Cavour]] in shallow water, but ''Giulio Cesare'' was not hit during the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] on 27 November 1940, but never got close enough to any British ships to fire at them. The ship was damaged in January 1941 by splinters from a near miss during an air raid on Naples by [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]]; repairs at Genoa were completed in early February. On 8 February, she sailed from to the [[Straits of Bonifacio]] to intercept what the Italians thought was a Malta convoy, but was actually a raid on Genoa. She failed to make contact with any British forces. She participated in the [[First Battle of Sirte]] on 17 December 1941, providing distant cover for a convoy bound for Libya, again never firing her main armament. She also provided distant cover for another convoy to North Africa in early January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 161–62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Giulio Cesare'' was reduced to a training ship afterwards at Taranto and later [[Pula|Pola]].&lt;ref name=b9&gt;Brescia, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The {{GS|U-596}} unsuccessfully attacked the ship in the [[Gulf of Taranto]] in early March 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, pp. 272, 298&lt;/ref&gt; After the Italian surrender on 9 September 1943, she steamed to Taranto, putting down a [[mutiny]] and enduring an ineffective attack by five German aircraft en route. She then sailed for Malta where she arrived on 12 September to be interned. The ship remained there until 17 June 1944 when she returned to Taranto where she remained for the next four years.&lt;ref name=w2&gt;Whitley, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet service===
[[File:Novorosiysk-1950-Sevastopol-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Novorossiysk'' at anchor, flying the Soviet ensign]]
After the war, ''Giulio Cesare'' was allocated to the Soviet Union as part of the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|war reparations]] and she was moved to [[Augusta, Sicily]] on 9 December 1948 where an unsuccessful attempt was made to sabotage the ship. The ship was stricken from the naval register on 15 December and turned over to the Soviets on 6 February 1949 under the temporary name of ''Z11'' in [[Vlorë]], Albania.&lt;ref name=w2/&gt; She was renamed by them as ''Novorossiysk'', after the Soviet city on the [[Black Sea]]. The Soviets used her as a training ship when she was not undergoing one of her eight refits in their hands. In 1953, all remaining Italian light AA guns were replaced by eighteen [[37 mm automatic air defense gun M1939 (61-K)|37 mm 70-K]] AA guns in six twin mounts and six singles. They also replaced her fire-control systems and added [[radar]]s, although the exact changes are unknown. The Soviets intended to rearm her with their own [[Obukhovskii 12&quot;/52 Pattern 1907 gun|305&amp;nbsp;mm guns]], but this was forestalled by her loss. While at anchor in [[Sevastopol]] on the night of 28/29 October 1955, she most likely detonated a large German [[naval mine|mine]] left over from World War II. The explosion blew a hole completely through the ship, making a {{convert|4|by|14|m|sp=us|adj=on}} hole in the forecastle forward of 'A' turret. The flooding could not be controlled and she later [[capsized]] with the loss of 608 men, including men sent from other ships to assist.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin 2003, pp. 419, 422&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the explosion is still unclear. The officially named cause, regarded as the most probable, was a magnetic RMH or LMB [[bottom mine]], laid by the Germans during [[World War II]] and triggered by the dragging of the battleship's anchor chain before [[wikt:moor|mooring]] for the last time. Subsequent searches located 32 mines of these types, some of them within {{convert|50|m|sp=us}} of the explosion. The damage was consistent with an explosion of {{convert|1000|-|1200|kg|sp=us}} of [[TNT]] and more than one mine may have detonated. Nonetheless, other explanations for the ship's loss have been proposed and the most popular of these is that she was sunk by Italian [[frogmen]] of the wartime special operations unit ''[[Decima Flottiglia MAS]]'' who — more than ten years after the cessation of hostilities — were either avenging the transfer of the former Italian battleship to the USSR or sinking it on behalf of [[NATO]].&lt;ref name=m23&gt;McLaughlin 2003, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin 2007, pp. 142–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bar-Biryukov|first=Oktyabr'|date=24 October 2005|title=Убить &quot;Цезаря&quot;|journal=иtornи|issue=43|url=http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2005/43/62079.html|accessdate=20 March 2014 | trans_title =Killing Caesar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
