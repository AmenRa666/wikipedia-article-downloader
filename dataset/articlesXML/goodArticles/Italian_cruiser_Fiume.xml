'''''Fiume''''' was a {{sclass-|Zara|cruiser|0}} [[heavy cruiser]] of the Italian [[Regia Marina]]. She was the second of four ships in the [[ship class|class]], and was built between April 1929 and November 1931. Armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} guns, she was nominally within the {{convert|10000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], though in reality she significantly exceeded this figure.

''Fiume'' saw extensive service during [[World War II]], having participated in several sorties to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean. She was present during the [[Battle of Calabria]] in July 1940, [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] in November, and ultimately the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in March 1941. In the last engagement, ''Fiume'' and her [[sister ship]]s {{ship|Italian cruiser|Zara||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Pola||2}} were sunk in a close-range night engagement with three British [[battleship]]s.

==Design==
[[File:Fiume launching a floatplane.png|thumb|upright|left|''Fiume'' launching a seaplane in 1935]]

{{main|Zara-class cruiser}}

''Fiume'' was {{convert|182.8|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20.62|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7.2|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|13944|LT|sp=us}} at full load, though her displacement was nominally within the {{convert|10000|LT|adj=on}} restriction set in place by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. Her power plant consisted of two [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s powered by eight oil-fired [[Yarrow boiler]]s, which were trunked into two funnels [[amidships]]. Her engines were rated at {{convert|95000|shp|lk=in}} and produced a top speed of {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}. She had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=GC292&gt;Gardiner &amp; Chesneau, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

She was protected with a [[belt armor|armored belt]] that was {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships. Her armor deck was {{convert|70|mm|abbr=on}} thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} at either end. The gun turrets had 150&amp;nbsp;mm thick plating on the faces and the [[barbette]]s they sat in were also 150&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The main conning tower had 150&amp;nbsp;mm thick sides.&lt;ref name=GC292/&gt;

She was armed with a main battery of eight [[203 mm /53 Italian naval gun|{{convert|203|mm|abbr=on}} Mod 29]] 53-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns in four [[gun turret]]s. The turrets were arranged in [[superfire|superfiring pairs]] forward and aft. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} 47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} guns in single mounts and eight {{convert|12.7|mm|abbr=on}} guns in twin mounts. She carried a pair of [[IMAM Ro.43]] [[seaplane]]s for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located in under the [[forecastle]] and a fixed [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] was mounted on the [[:wikt:centerline|centerline]] at the bow.&lt;ref name=GC292/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brescia, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fiume''{{'}}s secondary battery was revised several times during her career. Two of the 100&amp;nbsp;mm guns and all of the 40&amp;nbsp;mm and 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm guns were removed in the late 1930s and eight {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} 54-cal. guns and eight {{convert|13.2|mm|abbr=on}} guns were installed in their place. Two {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} 15-cal. [[starshell]] guns were added in 1940.&lt;ref name=GC292/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0214-500, Golf von Neapel, Italienische Kreuzer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Fiume'' (right) along with ''Zara'' and ''Pola'' in Naples]]
Built in the ''[[Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]]'' in [[Trieste]], ''Fiume'' was laid down on 29 April 1929, the first member of the class to be laid down. She was launched nearly a year later on 27 April 1930, the same day as her [[sister ship]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Zara||2}}. [[Fitting-out]] work lasted another year and a half, and the new cruiser was commissioned into the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) on 23 November 1931.&lt;ref name=GC292/&gt; In January 1935, tests with [[autogyro]]s were conducted aboard ''Fiume''; a wooden platform was built on the stern of the ship to support the aircraft. The experiments proved to be successful, although the autogyros themselves had very limited range and were unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fiume'' took part in a lavish ceremony held for the visit of [[Adolf Hitler]], the dictator of [[Nazi Germany]], in May 1938. She and ''Zara'' conducted a gunnery demonstration while Hitler and the dictator of Italy, [[Benito Mussolini]], observed from the [[battleship]] {{ship|Italian battleship|Conte di Cavour||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry &amp; Wellham, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
When Italy formally joined the [[Second World War]] by declaring war on France and Britain on 10 June 1940, ''Fiume'' was assigned to the 1st Division with ''Zara'' and the four destroyers of the 9th Destroyer Flotilla. The unit was assigned to the 1st Squadron, under the command of Admiral [[Inigo Campioni]].&lt;ref&gt;Brescia, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, ''Fiume'' and the rest of the 1st Division, along with the 9th Division, sortied in response to British attacks on Italian positions in [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; While they were at sea, the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|Odin|N84|6}} unsuccessfully attacked ''Fiume'' and her sister {{ship|Italian cruiser|Gorizia||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 July, a convoy left Naples, bound for North Africa; the following day, Italian reconnaissance reported a British cruiser squadron to have arrived in [[Malta]]. The Italian naval high command therefore ordered the 1st Division and several other cruisers and destroyers to join the escort for the convoy. The battleships ''Conte di Cavour'' and {{ship|Italian battleship|Giulio Cesare||2}} provide distant support. Two days later, the Italian fleet briefly clashed with the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in an [[Battle of Calabria|inconclusive action off Calabria]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September, the Italian fleet, including ''Fiume'', made a sweep for a British troop convoy from [[Alexandria]] to Malta, but it made no contact with the British ships.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fiume'' was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier [[Battle of Taranto|strike on Taranto]] on the night of 11&amp;ndash;12 November, but she was not attacked in the raid.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry &amp; Wellham, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]]. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and clashed with the British fleet the next day, in an engagement that lasted for about an hour. Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The British heavy cruiser [[HMS Berwick (65)|HMS ''Berwick'']] was hit twice by 203 mm rounds during the engagement, either fired by ''Fiume'' or her sister ''Pola''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Big Gun Battles: Warship Duels of the Second World War| last = Stern| first = Robert C.| publisher = Seaforth Publishing| year = 2015| isbn = 1473849691| location = | pages =60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Cape Matapan====
[[File:Www2mR130BMatapan.GIF|thumb|Map of the movements of the Italian and British fleets during the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]]]
The Italian fleet, now commanded by Admiral [[Angelo Iachino]], made another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late March 1941. The fleet was supported by the ''Regia Aeronautica'' and the German ''[[Fliegerkorps X]]'' (10th Air Corps).&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; This operation resulted in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]; early in the battle, ''Fiume'' and the rest of the 1st Division were to the northeast of the rest of the Italian fleet, which had encountered the British to the southwest. The battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}} was torpedoed by British aircraft and forced to withdraw during this phase of the battle. The 1st Division remained on the port side of the Italian fleet as it began its return to port to screen against another possible British attack.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, pp. 121&amp;ndash;124&lt;/ref&gt; A second British airstrike later in the day failed to locate the retiring ''Vittorio Veneto'' and instead torpedoed ''Pola'', which left the cruiser immobilized. ''Fiume'', ''Zara'', and four destroyers were detached to protect ''Pola''.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; The British fleet, centered on the battleships {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}}, {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}}, and {{HMS|Barham|04|2}}, was at this point only {{convert|50|nmi|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Guided by radar, the British fleet closed in on the crippled ''Pola'' in the darkness while ''Fiume'', ''Zara'', and the destroyers approached from the opposite direction. At 10:27, the searchlights aboard ''Warspite'', the leading British battleship, illuminated ''Fiume'' at a range of {{convert|2900|yd}}, followed immediately by a salvo of six {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} shells from her main battery; five struck ''Fiume'' and caused serious damage. Her superfiring rear turret was blown overboard before a second salvo from ''Warspite'' struck the ship. Shortly thereafter, ''Valiant'' fired four 15-inch shells into ''Fiume'', causing further devastation. ''Fiume'', now a burning wreck, was spared further destruction as the British battleships turned their attention to ''Zara''. ''Fiume'' fell out of line, listing badly to starboard, as ''Zara'' was similarly hammered by 15-inch broadsides. ''Fiume'' remained afloat for about 45 minutes before she capsized and sank stern first at 23:15. Two of the destroyers, ''Alfieri'' and ''Carducci'', were also sunk, as were ''Zara'' and ''Pola''. The action had lasted a mere three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 139&amp;ndash;141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, pp. 125&amp;ndash;131&lt;/ref&gt; 812 men were lost with ''Fiume'', among them her commanding officer Capt. Giorgio Giorgis; the survivors were picked up by British destroyers on the following morning, Greek destroyers in the evening of 29 March and the Italian hospital ship ''Gradisca'' between 31 March and 3 April.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marina.difesa.it/storiacultura/storia/medaglie/Pagine/Giorgisgiorgio.aspx|title=Giorgio Giogis|accessdate=16 February 2015|website=marina.difesa.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi, Brescia &amp; Bagnasco, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fioravanzo, pp. 480-481&lt;/ref&gt;
