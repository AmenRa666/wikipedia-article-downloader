==(Killing millions)==
Removed the reference to the Black Death &quot;killing millions&quot; in 1348-1351, since it was vague and excessive, or a guess. According to 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_of_England
the population of England decreased from 3,750,000 to 2,500,000 during this period, a difference of 1.25 million.

==Title==

This page title is confusing. I think there needs to be a way to distinguish this from the German Peasant's Revolt of 1525, which is more important. Should the revolts be categorized by date? By location?

-[[User:Alex S|Alex S]]

The Title is not confusing, the English uprising is known as the Peasant's Revolt, the German uprising some 150 years later is almost always referred to as the Peasant War, it was a far, far larger conflict.

[[[[User:Trotboy|Trotboy]] 22:03, 1 February 2006 (UTC)]]

:The title is not confusing in terms of which event it refers to, but it is inaccurate.  Very few historians now would accept the label 'Peasants' Revolt', since members of the lower orders of the clergy and London townspeople (not to mention the burgesses of Cambridge) were involved.  However, I don't reccommend changing the title because it's known to non-specialists (ie most people) as the 'Peasants' Revolt'.  The common alternative, 'the 1381 risings', is too obscure for most people, I think. - DH

::Agreed, titles of articles are a matter of convenience, to allow for the widest audience to understand what it means (see [[Medieval science]], there was no &quot;science&quot; in the Middle Ages). The opening paragraph provides alternative names and clarifications. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 13:21, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
:::I've now noted the general context, which is [[ popular revolt in late medieval Europe]], in the heading. A better title for this article would not be capitalized and would be dated: [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]].  Would there be any objections to such a title, if I fixed the redirects? --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 17:42, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

::::It depends on your perspective - as an editor, your right, [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]] fits the scheme of things better and is more logical. As a general reader, Peasants' Revolt is how most people know it by. --[[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 20:32, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

:::[[Peasants' Revolt]] would remain as a redirect, of course: let no one be left behind. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 01:08, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

Six weeks later: any objections to [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]]? --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 06:22, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

:Sounds ok to me. In fact we could even make [[Peasants' Revolt]] (and [[Peasants Revolt]] and permutations) a disambiguation page, since outside an English history context it has more meanings. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 15:30, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

See [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)]]. It's generally referred to as the Peasants' Revolt, and I don't see any reason why that shouldn't be the title. It's a proper name (like the [[Second World War]], the [[Wars of the Roses]] and the [[Rising of the North]]) and so should be capitalised. And it may not be entirely accurate, but then these things seldom are: the [[Hundred Years' War]] didn't last 100 years, and the [[War of 1812]] didn't just take place in 1812. [[User:Proteus|Proteus]] [[User_talk:Proteus|(Talk)]] 15:15, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
:This is controversial, there are many things on Wikipedia that have been called Peasants Revolt, it is confusing and leads to disambiguation problems. Restoring to previous until there is consensus. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 16:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

::I can only see two, this and [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt]], which seems quite happy there. All the others seem to be called different things. This is undoubtedly the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|primary topic]] for this particular name in the English-speaking world. [[User:Proteus|Proteus]] [[User_talk:Proteus|(Talk)]] 16:52, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Many things can be called a &quot;peasant revolt&quot;, either colloquially or directly. See [[Popular revolt in late medieval Europe]]. They all have various and different names depending. I'm happy to go with whatever consensus says on this as good arguments can be made either way. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 16:57, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

::::But this isn't called &quot;a peasant revolt&quot;, it's called &quot;the Peasants' Revolt&quot; (it is also, of course, &quot;a peasant revolt&quot;, &quot;a peasants' revolt&quot;, &quot;a popular revolt&quot;, and many other things, but they aren't its name). Articles are generally named by the name of a subject, if it has one, not by a description of it (which is what the current title is). And while there are other similar revolts, they are all generally referred to by more specific names, whereas this is simply called &quot;the Peasants' Revolt&quot; (in the English-speaking world, obviously). And there's no need for [[Peasants' Revolt]] to be a disambig page &amp;mdash; we already have one at a different name, and it's been a redirect for six months pointing to the very article that's apparently not allowed to use it as a title... (Of course it would be difficult to change it from that, since so many articles link to it expecting to get here, which is a good indication that this is indeed the primary topic and thus not in need of disambiguation.) [[User:Proteus|Proteus]] [[User_talk:Proteus|(Talk)]] 17:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::[[peasant revolt]] is a dab page which lists all the revolts and wars that could be easily confused when someone types in the general term &quot;peasant revolt&quot;.  The redirect of &quot;Peasants' Revolt&quot; to this article is fine for anyone who types in the correct term &quot;Peasants' Revolt&quot; (with the apostrophe and Capitalization). The end goal of article naming is to decrease confusion and make it easier for the user to find what they are looking for. With the current arrangement anyone who types in &quot;Peasants' Revolt&quot; will get to the assumed right place (here), anyone who types in &quot;peasant revolt&quot; will get to a dab page which then lists the more specific name. However, if this article was called &quot;Peasants' Revolt&quot;, it would increase confusion because it is so similar to [[peasant revolt]] which is a dab page. This is kind of similar to the [[Norman Conquest]] -- which one? Normally when people say Norman Conquest, they mean the one of England, but there are others, so the article is called more properly [[Norman Conquest of England]]. But &quot;Norman Conquest&quot; still redirects to Norman Conquest of England since that is what most people know it by. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 15:57, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::::That article's at the wrong place too. I can see why people might want to do it this way, but it's simply not the way Wikipedia policy says it's supposed to be done. Variants are supposed to redirect to the most commonly used name, not vice versa. [[User:Proteus|Proteus]] [[User_talk:Proteus|(Talk)]] 17:06, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
::::::::&lt;--continued..
Your probably right. The contradiction of the rules is this: we would have [[Peasants' Revolt]] (article) and [[Peasant revolt]] (dab page) which are two different articles, yet they are too closely named for dab purposes and easily confused, which is the reason this article was renamed, to adhere to the Dab MoS on that point. Probably the correct solution is  to do the following:
#Rename this article to [[Peasants' Revolt]]
#Rename [[Peasant revolt]] to [[Peasant revolt (disambiguation)]]
#Redirect other permutations of &quot;peasants revolt&quot; to [[Peasant revolt (disambiguation)]].
Let me know what you think. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 23:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

:That would seem ok, but I'm not sure it's necessary. I think [[Peasants' Revolt]] is different enough to [[peasant revolt]] that that the latter can be validly used as a redirect on its own. [[User:Proteus|Proteus]] [[User_talk:Proteus|(Talk)]] 10:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

::So much for the neutral descriptor [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]], which is at least a redirect. &quot;English&quot; cannot be tacitly assumed in an international English-language encyclopedia, though it suffices in a ''History of Medieval England''.--[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] ([[User talk:Wetman|talk]]) 16:38, 28 December 2008 (UTC)

== Details on how third poll tax differed from earlier ones? ==

:The third poll tax, unlike the two earlier, was not levied on a flat rate basis (as in 1377) nor according to schedule (as in 1379), but in a manner that appeared more arbitrary and hence unfair. 

Can someone expand on this? --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] | [[User talk:Jim Henry|Talk]] 21:38, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

All these things they ought to do by servage, and there be more of these people in England than in any other realm. Thus the noblemen and prelates are served by them, and especially in the county of Kent, Essex, Sussex and Bedford. These unhappy people of these said countries began to stir, because they said they were kept in great servage, and in the beginning of the world, they said, there were no bondmen, wherefore they maintained that none ought to be bond&quot;	+	*[http://www.ku.edu/kansas/medieval/108/texts/froissart.html &quot;Wat Tyler's Rebellion&quot;], from ''The Chronicles of Froissart'', , pp 61-63 includes John Ball's speech.

What have we deserved, or why should we be kept thus in servitude? We be all come from one father and one mother, Adam and Eve: whereby can they say or show that they be greater lords than we be, saving but they cause us to win and labour for that which they spend? They are clothed in velvet and camlet furred with grise, and we be vestured with poor cloth: they have their wines, spices and good bread, and we have the rye, the bran and the straw, and drink water: they dwell in fair houses, and we have the pain and travail, rain and wind in the fields; and by that that comes from our labours they keep and maintain their estates: we are called their bondmen, and unless we readily do them service, we are beaten; and we have no sovereign to whom we may complain, nor will hear us nor do us right. Let us go to the king, he is young, and shew him what servitude we be in, and show him how we will have it otherwise, or else we will provide us some remedy; and if we go together, all manner of people that be now in any bondage will follow us with the intent to be made free; and when the king sees us, we shall have some remedy, either by fairness or otherwise.&quot;	+

-	*[http://www.nipissingu.ca/department/history/muhlberger/froissart/king.htm The End of the Revolt] &quot;After the executions of Tyler, Jack Straw, John Ball, William Lister, Walker and several others at London, the people being appeased, the king resolved to visit his bailiwicks, castlewicks, and stewardships, in order to punish the wicked and to recover the letters of pardon which had been forced from him, as well as to place the realm in its proper situation. The king issued a secret summons for a certain number of men at arms to assemble at a fixed place, on a particular day, which was done. They amounted to five hundred spears and as many archers. When they were thus assembled, the king set out from London, attended only by his household, and took the road to Kent, for in that quarter the rebellion had first broken out. These men at arms followed the king, but did not accompany him. The king entered the county of Kent, and came to a village called Comprinke, when he had the mayor and all the men of the village called before him. On their being assembled in an open space, the king ordered one of his council to remonstrate with them, how much they had erred against him, and that they had nearly thrown England into desolation and ruin; and because this mischief must have had some advisers who had encouraged them in their wickedness, and it must be supposed that all were not equally guilty, it was better that the ringleaders should suffer than the whole; his majesty demanded that those should be pointed out who had been so culpable, under pain of incurring his indignation for ever, and being considered as traitors. When those present heard this harangue, and saw that the innocent might escape by pointing out the guilty, they looked at each other, and then said: &quot;My lord, here is one by whom this town was first put into confusion and excited to rise.&quot; He was immediately seized and hanged; as were seven others. The letters patent which had been granted were demanded back: when they were given up, the king's officers tore them in pieces before their eyes, and cast them away, and then said, -- &quot;We command all ye who are here assembled, in the kings' name, and under pain of death, to depart, every one peaceably to his own home; and that you never rebel more against the king, nor against his ministers. By the punishment that has been inflicted, your former evil deeds are pardoned.&quot; The people cried out with one voice, &quot;God bless the king and his good council.&quot; They acted in the same manner ...in the different part of England where the people had rebelled; so that upwards of fifteen hundred were beheaded or hanged. &quot; [[User:WAS 4.250|WAS 4.250]] 21:01, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

== Brentwood or Fobbing? ==

The BBC web site (http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/voices/voices_revolt.shtml) says &quot;The Peasants' Revolt began in the Essex village of Fobbing in May 1381. It started with the arrival of a royal tax commissioner, John Bampton, enquiring into evasion of the new poll-tax. As a JP and former sheriff of Essex, Bampton was typical of the local notables against whom the risings were directed. Supported by men from nearby villages the rebellion had begun.&quot; The current article gives roughly the same events, but places them in Brentwood. Does anyone have access to a good source that can help? [[User:Rjm at sleepers|Rjm at sleepers]] ([[User talk:Rjm at sleepers|talk]]) 09:18, 5 December 2007 (UTC) I will edit the section based on a Google Books entry. Probably deserves a better source if one is available. [[User:Rjm at sleepers|Rjm at sleepers]] ([[User talk:Rjm at sleepers|talk]]) 10:22, 5 December 2007 (UTC).


I have come across many articles and as a history student have been taught that it was Fobbing. I have just added a reference to it on the page itself.

== The last poll tax? ==

The [[Poll Tax]] article says &quot;The poll tax was essentially a lay subsidy (a tax on the movable property of most of the population) to help fund war. It had first been levied in 1275 and continued, under different names, until the 17th century.&quot; Thus, according to Wikipedia, poll taxes continued to be levied after the Peasant's revolt. [[User:Rjm at sleepers|Rjm at sleepers]] ([[User talk:Rjm at sleepers|talk]]) 06:15, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

== Tempore Rumoris ==

The term &quot;Peasants' Revolt&quot; is one coined by historians in the nineteenth century and is un unreflective of the variety of rebels. Wat Tyler and John Ball both came from large towns, and townsmen and low clergy were numerously included in the ranks of those rebelling. In Norfolk there is an uncommon example of members of the titled gentry joining in as two knights and an esquire were among those in revolt.

Contemporary commentators refered to to the events as &quot;Tempore Rumoris&quot; or &quot;The time of whispers/rumours&quot;. This epithet reflects much more effectively the widespread criticism levelled at governmental activity during the period, and is irrespective of any social distinctions between those taking part and indeed those who may well have passively supported the rebels too.

==The revolt outside London==
There is little mention of the revolt outside London or post Smithfield.  I've added a section on this and made the briefest of starts on the Norfolk revolt.  There is a lot more to be said and I hope others will take up the challenge of expanding the coverage. [[User:Monstrelet|Monstrelet]] ([[User talk:Monstrelet|talk]]) 14:17, 26 December 2010 (UTC)

== Beginning of the end of serfdom ==

Currently the article says in the lead:
{{quotation|The revolt later came to be seen as a mark of the beginning of the end of serfdom in medieval England, although the revolt itself was a failure. It increased awareness in the upper classes of the need for the reform of feudalism in England and the appalling misery felt by the lower classes as a result of their enforced near-slavery.}}
This needs a citation as it is not an accurate summary of the body of the text, and is not supported by the economic profile of many of the known participants in the rebellion.  -- [[User:Philip Baird Shearer|PBS]] ([[User talk:Philip Baird Shearer|talk]]) 11:03, 15 October 2011 (UTC)

::*Kappalovin, I suspect that you're probably one of these students. If you haven't already, have a look at [[Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing]].

== Expansion ==

I've given the article an over-haul. I think it now reflects the current literature, and is fully referenced. It will certainly need a copyedit, etc. however, as I'm certain there a range of typos left in it. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 16:25, 10 May 2013 (UTC)

== Lords and Commons... ==

I've added a reference in to support the identification of two groupings here. The terms &quot;the House of Lords&quot; and &quot;the House of Commons&quot; first come from the 16th century, but aren't typically used to describe the 14th century institutions; the terms are a bit anachronistic for the 14th century, carry a number of assumptions based on later parliamentary practice, and I'd argue you'll typically find historians of the 14th century being quite specific about how they refer to the 14th century versions. There is some variance about whether they are capitalised or not (&quot;the commons&quot; versus &quot;the Commons&quot;), with the latter being more common and more widely used by modern historians, I think. I agree, by the way, that the Commons link should have been more specific to the English parliament. I think this should also have made reference to the clergy, and I've added them in.

== About taxation ==

Hello! I have some questions about taxation. I can do some mistakes in English, because I`m Russian, please be careful. 

&quot;the poll tax, which was levied at the rate of four pence&quot; - for which period people had to pay that amount? Also, what does &quot;with a deduction for married couples&quot; mean? They didn`t pay, or only one human in couple paid? &quot;his round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000&quot; for which perod?--[[User:Schetnikova Anna|Schetnikova Anna]] ([[User talk:Schetnikova Anna|talk]]) 11:51, 24 September 2013 (UTC)

I put this in because I think that the speech's reported text is quite illuminating. I noticed that the article refers to Sumption, who in turn refers to Froissart a lot if you look at his footnotes. '''&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[User:Wikidea|Wik]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gold&quot;&gt;[[User:Wikidea|idea]]&lt;/font&gt;''' 17:32, 17 April 2014 (UTC)
:The usual problem with Froissart as a source for this period is that he wasn't there in person, he has clear biases and he does tend to embellish the details (see Jones's commentary on him as a primary source). There are no perfect sources for the revolt, though, so every modern historian I've come across uses a combination. Sumption uses a combination of primary sources for his paragraph on the sermon, including Anonimalle, Walsingham, Knighton and Froissart; he doesn't quote the text used by Macaulay. Dunn describes some of the differences in the chroniclers' accounts of Ball, which gives a sense of the problems of interpreting the sources of this period. The most famous bit of the sermon, &quot;When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then a gentleman?&quot; is now known to have been common before Ball used it (see Hilton's description of this background). If you'll allow me a bit of OR (given this is a talk page!) there isn't a commonly agreed text of what Ball actually said, which is why modern specialist historians of this period are so cautious about quoting anything at length (I only know of one historian that has, and that's in a relatively &quot;popular&quot; work, and footnoted as being potentially unreliable).

::I'm not sure it matters too much - even if Froissart isn't quoting Ball (and of course he's not), because Froissart was writing in 1385 this makes his account relevant in itself. You've done a great article, but don't be precious about people like me making improvements. I take it that you don't have a better source.

:::Thanks Wikidiea. It's not that I think there's a better source - it's rather that I don't believe that current historians think that there is ''any'' good source for what Ball actually said (as opposed to the broad themes he put across, where there is consistency across most of the accounts).

== Queries ==

[[User:Hchc2009|Hchc]] I have looked at this with a view to nominating for TFA, and I have a few queries.
*The article doubts Jack Straw was a real person but also says a Jack Straw was executed. Presumably the man executed may not have been the leader but I think it is worth spelling that out.
*The article is inconsistent between advisor and adviser. Personally I prefer adviser, but obviously both are correct so long as they are consistent.
*Note 8. &quot;After the revolt three aldermen were put on trial by the authorities, including John Horn, Walter Sibil and William Tongue&quot; As all three are named I think &quot;including&quot; should be deleted.
*Note 10. &quot;Winchester,&quot; a former capital of England until c. 1100&quot; Historians of Anglo-Saxon England regard the idea of Winchester having been the capital as a myth - e.g. Stenton p. 539 where he says that in the 11th century the court was mobile and the idea of a capital had not yet emerged.
*Any view on this article as a TFA? [[User:Dudley Miles|Dudley Miles]] ([[User talk:Dudley Miles|talk]]) 19:46, 16 December 2014 (UTC)

:I would dispute your assertion that &quot;Historians of Anglo-Saxon England regard the idea of Winchester having been the capital as a myth&quot; since this is not at all the case and a vast number of reliable specialist sources may easily be produced contradicting Stenton's thesis, and fully verifying Winchester's status as the capital of England. It is also easily documented that William I maintained Winchester as the old capital alongside London as his new capital, however following his reign London was the only capital. This is what the great preponderance of scholarship says and Stenton's objections here are a clear minority. [[User:Mr. Lunt|Mr. Lunt]] ([[User talk:Mr. Lunt|talk]]) 20:32, 16 December 2014 (UTC)

:::Which specialist sources? This claim is constantly put forward but whenever I have asked for sources they are either popular works or by historians of later periods (as no doubt applies in this case). I read extensively on Anglo-Saxon history and I have never seen Winchester described as the capital of Wessex or England. The article on Winchester by the leading Winchester historian John Crook in the 2014 edition of ''The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' says nothing about it being the capital. Oxford University professor Sarah Foot in her 2011 biography of Æthelstan says p. 78 that it was not the capital, but &quot;just one of the West Saxon king's many royal residences, albeit apparently a favourite one&quot;.

::Jack Straw - I'll check the sources tomorrow to see how they phrased it; it's certainly accurate as currently put, but we might be able to be stronger/clearer.
::Advisor and adviser actually carry slightly different meanings, but I doubt if I was being that precise when I drafted the article. I'll check over it tomorrow.
::Aldermen - well caught, corrected.
::I'll double check the Winchester bit, but from memory I think we've addressed this before in discussions on either this or a similar page, and I think Frank Stenton's views are slightly outdated now.

:::::I do not think that the change helps. The question that comes to my mind when I read that sentence - after reading that historians doubt whether Jack Straw existed - is what do they think of this one? Is it significant that the man executed was a London leader and Jack Straw was identified with Kent? Was Jack Straw a common name in that period?

== the temple...systematically destroyed the buildings ==

It is my understanding that the rebels brought the Hospitaller documents out of &quot;the Temple&quot; on Fleet Street and destroyed the documents, then left the Temple in tact.

== bread and cheese ==

It should be added to the article that the rebels immediately killed every man in Londen they met who was unable to correctly pronounce the words &quot;bread and cheese&quot;; those persons were held to be Flemings. Among the killed, there were numerous German foreigners, too. Many Germans then stayed in London for purpose of trading. The rebels didn't differntiate between Flemings and Germans. In the 14th century, Flanders was still a part of the Holy Roman Empire.

Besides, in the article it is not mentioned why the Flemish people were a main target of killings, that is many of them were tax collectors.
