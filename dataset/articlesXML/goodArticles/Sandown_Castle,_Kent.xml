'''Sandown Castle''' was an artillery fort constructed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in [[Sandown]], [[Kent]], between 1539 and 1540. It formed part of the King's [[Device Fort|Device programme]] to protect against invasion from France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and defended the strategically important [[the Downs|Downs anchorage]] off the English coast.

Comprising a [[keep]] and four circular [[bastions]], the [[moat]]ed stone castle covered {{convert|0.59|acre}} and had 39 firing positions on the upper levels for [[List of medieval and early modern gunpowder artillery|artillery]], with 31 [[gunloop]]s in the basement for [[handgun]]s. It cost [[the Crown]] a total of £27,092 to build the three castles of Sandown, [[Walmer Castle|Walmer]] and [[Deal Castle|Deal]], which lay adjacent to one another along the coast and were connected by earthwork defences.{{efn|name=Money16thC}} The original invasion threat passed, but during the [[Second English Civil War]] of 1648–49, Sandown was seized by pro-[[Cavalier|Royalist]] insurgents and was only retaken by [[Roundheads|Parliamentary forces]] after several months' fighting.

By the 19th century, the castle was suffering badly from the effects of [[coastal erosion]] but remained in military use until 1863. The [[War Office]] then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] for £35 to form part of the local [[sea defences]].{{efn|name=Money19thC}} The remaining masonry was encased in [[concrete]] in the late 1980s to form a [[sea wall]] but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.

==History==

===16th century===
Sandown Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the final years of the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Traditionally [[the Crown]] had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1987|p=111}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modest defences, based around simple [[blockhouse]]s and towers, existed in the south-west and along the [[Sussex]] coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1991|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walmer or Sandown (Kent) castle, 1539 draft.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An 1539 early design for either Sandown or nearby [[Walmer Castle]]]]
In 1533, Henry broke with Pope [[Paul III]] to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], and remarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was the aunt of [[Charles V of Spain|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, and Charles took the annulment as a personal insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; An invasion of England appeared certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;[[Device Fort|device]]&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Walton|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandown and the adjacent castles of [[Deal Castle|Deal]] and [[Walmer Castle|Walmer]] were constructed to protect [[the Downs]] in east Kent, an important anchorage formed by the [[Goodwin Sands]] that gave access to [[Deal, Kent|Deal Beach]], on which enemy soldiers could easily be landed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1991|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone castles were supported by a line of four earthwork forts, known as the Great Turf, the Little Turf Bulwark, the Great White Bulwark of Clay and the Walmer Bulwark, and a {{convert|2.5|mi}} long defensive ditch and bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively the castles became known as the &quot;castles of the Downs&quot; and cost the Crown a total of £27,092.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money16thC|Comparing early modern costs and prices with those of the modern period is challenging. £27,092 in 1539 could be equivalent to between £15.3 million and £6,960 million in 2014, depending on the price comparison used, and £174 to between £98,000 to £44 million. For comparison, the total royal expenditure on all the Device Forts across England between 1539–47 came to £376,500, with [[St Mawes Castle|St Mawes]], for example, costing £5,018, and [[Sandgate Castle|Sandgate]] £5,584.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biddle|Hiller|Scott|Streeten|2001|p=12}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ | title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1270 to Present| author1 = Lawrence H. Officer | author2= Samuel H. Williamson| mode = cs2|date = 2014| accessdate=29 May 2015 | publisher=MeasuringWorth}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The castle was built between April 1539 and the autumn of 1540, by a team including Richard Benese as the surveyor, William Clement as the master carpenter, and Christopher Dickenson as the master mason.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=8}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/unvbrit/a/001cotaugi00001u00021000.html|title=A Colored bird's Eye View of &quot;A Castle for the Downes&quot;; Probably an Early Design for Walmer and Sundown Castles|publisher=British Library|access-date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nearly identical to its sister castle at Walmer, with a tall [[keep]], {{convert|83|ft}} across, at the centre, and flanked by four rounded [[bastion]]s, also called lunettes, and a [[moat]], which was surrounded in turn by a [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Rutton|1898|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its curved walls were {{convert|15|feet}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total it was approximately {{convert|165|by|165|ft}} across, covering {{convert|0.59|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutton|1898|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[John Rigby Hale|John Hale]] considered the castle to form a transitional design between older medieval English designs and [[Star fort|newer Italian style]]s of defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandown had three tiers of [[List of medieval and early modern gunpowder artillery|artillery]] – the heaviest and longest range weapons occupying the upper levels – with a total of 39 firing positions, and 31 [[gunloop]]s in the basement for [[handgun]]s should close defence be required.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrington21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[embrasure]]s in the walls were all widely splayed to provide the maximum possible space for the guns to operate and traverse, and the interior of the castle was designed with vents to allow the smoke from its guns to escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrington21&quot;/&gt;  It was initially garrisoned by a captain, two lieutenants, two porters, ten gunners and three soldiers, at an annual cost of £174 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money16thC}}

Although the original invasion threat passed, Sandown continued in military use into the 17th century. A 1616 survey nonetheless reported that a range of repairs were needed, at an estimated total cost of £437, while a 1634 survey noted that work estimated at £1,243 was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|pp=172–173, 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an inspection in 1635 showed the castle to be in reasonable structural condition, but antiquated in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bull|2008|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report produced in 1641 suggested that £8,000 of investment was required in the three castles of the Downs, including £3,000 for additional [[sea defence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money17thC|Comparing early modern costs and prices with those of the modern period is challenging. £43 in 1616 could be equivalent to between £73,000 and £23 million in 2014, depending on the price comparison used; £1,243 in 1634 to between £179,000 and £51 million, and £8,000 in 1641 to between £1.2 million and £351 million.&lt;ref name=MeasuringWorth/&gt;}}

Sandown Castle did not play a prominent role during the first [[English Civil War]] that broke out between the supporters of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[Parliament]]; it was taken by Parliamentary forces at the start of the conflict in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the few years of unsteady peace after 1645, the [[Second English Civil War|Second Civil War]] broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Sandown and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Kennedy|1962|pp=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice-Admiral [[William Batten]] had been forced by Parliamentary officials to resign from his post as Commander of the Fleet the previous year, and he now encouraged the fleet to join the Royalist faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1962|pp=248–250}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Henry Palmer, a former sailor, accompanied by other members of the Kentish gentry, also called on the fleet to revolt, taking advantage of the many fellow Kentish men in the crews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashton|1994|p=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandown Castle declared for the King, followed shortly afterwards by the garrisons at Deal and Walmer as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1962|pp=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast or aid sent to the Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashton|1994|pp=439–440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament defeated the wider insurgency at the [[Battle of Maidstone]] at the start of June, and then sent a force under the command of Colonel [[Nathaniel Rich (soldier)|Nathaniel Rich]] to deal with Sandown and the other castles along the Downs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashton|1994|p=440}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged and surrendered on 12 July.&lt;ref name=HarringtonP51&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earthwork fort was then built between Sandown and Deal, which may have been defended by around 150 men each.&lt;ref name=HarringtonP51/&gt; Deal was attacked in late July, and in August artillery assaults began on Sandown as well.&lt;ref name=HarringtonP51/&gt; The Royalists mounted an attack from the fleet on 10 August, with a second attack following on 15 August, involving a landing of 750 men supported by 50 soldiers from Sandown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashton|1994|p=441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither operation was successful and Sandown finally surrendered on 5 September, a few weeks after the surrender of Deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Ashton|1994|p=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1649, Parliament ordered that supplies of ammunition and powder be sent to Sandown and the other castles of the Downs.&lt;ref name=ElvinP210&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh earthworks were erected during the [[Interregnum]] between Sandown and Deal to address with the threat of Dutch attack.&lt;ref name=ElvinP210/&gt; The garrison at Sandown remained substantial during the period, with a governor and 21 soldiers, but when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was [[Restoration (England)|restored to the throne]] in 1660 he reduced the numbers again to a captain and 18 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|pp=211–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 against Charles' brother, King [[James II of England|James II]], the townsfolk of Deal seized Sandown Castle on behalf of [[William III of England|William III]], the [[Prince of Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Parliamentarian, Colonel [[John Hutchinson (Roundhead)|John Hutchinson]], was infamously detained by the Crown at Sandown in 1664; his wife, [[Lucy Hutchinson|Lucy]], who subsequently widely publicised his case, described the castle as ruinous and his imprisonment there as inhumane.&lt;ref name=MackenzieP40&gt;{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several months Hutchinson died in the castle, his doctor blaming his physical decline on the conditions in which he had been kept.&lt;ref name=MackenzieP40/&gt;

===18th–21st centuries===
[[File:Sandown Castle 1853.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Engraving of the castle in 1853]]
In 1785, the sea broke through the outer walls of the castle, and coastal erosion continued over the next few years.&lt;ref name=ElvinP226&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was initially described as being &quot;barely habitable&quot;, but by 1793 it was considered &quot;unfit for habitation.&quot;&lt;ref name=ElvinP226/&gt; It was repaired and garrisoned again during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], with two new [[artillery battery|artillery batteries]] being constructed to the north of the castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;elvin226&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the 19th century the castle was used as by the early [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|coastguard]] for the suppression of local [[smuggling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Elvin|1894|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coastal erosion continued during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the [[War Office]] sold off the reusable materials of the fortification for £564 in 1863 and demolished the upper parts of the castle, leaving a level platform across the lower parts of the keep and the bastions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1890|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Lewis|1884|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money19thC|Comparing 19th century costs and prices with those of the modern period depends on the price comparison used. £563 in 1863 could be worth between £57,000 and £1.2 million in 2014 terms, depending on the measure used, and £35 in 1894 to between £3,700 and £42,000.&lt;ref name=MeasuringWorth&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ | title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1270 to Present| author1 = Lawrence H.

In 1883 architectural historian Hayter Lewis complained to the [[British Archaeological Association]] that more needed to be done to protect the ruins, contrasting their poor treatment with that of the other castles along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1884|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, concerns continued to be raised about the safety of the ruins facing along the sea, and in 1894 the Royal Engineers blew up the bastions and the keep on the seaward side using guncotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Deal then bought the remains from the government for £35 for use as part of their local sea defences.&lt;ref name=&quot;MackenzieP40&quot;/&gt;{{efn|name=Money19thC}} Coastal erosion continued and between 1988 and 1989 the remains were encased in [[concrete]] to form a [[sea wall]], although they remain vulnerable to further coastal erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dover.gov.uk/Environment/Coast--Rivers/Coast-Protection/Coastal-Defences.aspx|title=Coastal Defences|publisher=Dover District Council|access-date=26 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626093224/http://www.dover.gov.uk/Environment/Coast--Rivers/Coast-Protection/Coastal-Defences.aspx
