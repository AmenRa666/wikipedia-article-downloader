'''''Girl Pat''''' was a small [[fishing trawler]], based at the [[Lincolnshire]] port of [[Grimsby]], that in 1936 was the subject of a media sensation when its captain took it on an unauthorised transatlantic voyage. The escapade ended in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[British Guiana]], with the arrest of the captain, [[Dod Orsborne|George &quot;Dod&quot; Orsborne]], and his brother. The pair were later imprisoned for the theft of the vessel.

Built in 1935, ''Girl Pat'' was the property of the Marstrand Fishing Company of Grimsby. On 1 April 1936, Orsborne, with a crew of four and his brother James as a [[supernumerary]], took the vessel out on what the owners authorised as a routine [[North Sea]] fishing trip of two to three weeks' duration. After leaving port, Orsborne informed the crew that they were going on an extended cruise in more southerly waters. Nothing more was heard of them until mid-May, when the owners, who had by then assumed the vessel lost, received invoices relating to its repair and reprovisioning in the northern Spanish port of [[Corcubión]]. Subsequent sightings placed her in the [[Savage Islands]], at [[Dakar]] in Senegal, and [[Îles du Salut]] off the coast of [[French Guiana]] in South America. The captain's main means of navigation during a voyage of more than {{convert|6000|nmi|km}} was a sixpenny school atlas and a compass. At one point ''Girl Pat'' was reported wrecked in the Bahamas, with all hands lost. After the vessel's capture and detention following a chase outside Georgetown on 19 June, Orsborne and his crew were hailed as heroes in the world's press.

Charged with the theft of the vessel in October 1936, Orsborne maintained in court that the owners had instructed him to get rid of the ship, as part of a scheme to obtain its insurance value. This claim was dismissed by the court. Years later, in his memoirs, Orsborne told a different, uncorroborated story: in absconding with ''Girl Pat'' he had been carrying out a mission on behalf of [[Naval Intelligence Division|British Naval Intelligence]], connected with the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War, 1936|Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936. 

After his release from prison, Orsborne took part in further maritime adventures and served in the navy in the Second World War. He died in 1957. In Georgetown ''Girl Pat'' was acquired by new owners who returned her to Britain, where she was displayed as a tourist attraction in several resorts. In 1939 she was sold to the [[Port of London Authority]] for use as a wreck-marking vessel and, after being requisitioned by the [[Royal Navy]] during the war, was returned to the authority in 1945. There is no public record of her subsequent career.

=== Orsborne ===
[[File:Fish Dock, Grimsby, Lincolnshire.jpg|thumb|Grimsby fishing vessels, early 20th century]]
[[George &quot;Dod&quot; Orsborne|George Black Orsborne]] was born George Black on 4 July 1902,{{refn|In his memoirs Orsborne gives 4 July 1918 as his 16th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, at the time of the ''Girl Pat'' affair, most press accounts gave his age as 32,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite news|title= Crew of the Girl Pat|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/481510048/341D52890B444A4PQ/27?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Observer|date= 21 June 1936|page= 20}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that he was born in 1903 or possibly 1904. At least one 1936 newspaper account reported an older age.&lt;ref name= Ab27&gt;{{cite news|title= Girl Pat Leaves Dakar|newspaper= The Aberdeen Journal|date= 27 May 1936|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; |group= n}} in the small north Scottish coastal town of [[Buckie]]. He assumed the Orsborne name when his widowed mother remarried and moved the family to [[Aberdeen]], where George, nicknamed &quot;Dod&quot;, spent his formative years.&lt;ref name= Ab27 /&gt; When he was 14, Orsborne lied about his age and enlisted as a Boy Seaman in the [[Royal Navy]]; in his memoirs he wrote: &quot;I never did have an adolescence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[Dover Patrol]], and was wounded during the 1918 [[Zeebrugge Raid]].&lt;ref name = times21&gt;{{cite news|title= Voyage of Girl Pat: Skipper in the Box|url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS184758101&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|newspaper= The Times|date= 21 October 1936|page= 11}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the Navy in December 1919 and working ashore for a brief period, he was persuaded by a former captain of the ''[[Cutty Sark]],'' Captain Wilkins, to go back to sea.&lt;ref name= times2110&gt;{{cite news|title= Voyage of Girl Pat|url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS184758101&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|newspaper= The Times|date= 21 October 1936|page= 11}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|merchant navy]],&lt;ref name= WestA&gt;{{cite news|title= Runaway Trawler: Skipper Orsborne's Defence|url= http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/40970526|newspaper= The West Australian|date= 22 October 1936|page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; sailing mainly in small ships based in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name= O37/&gt;

At 21 he passed his [[Master mariner#United Kingdom|master's ticket]] examinations and took over his first command, a [[Grimsby]] trawler.&lt;ref name= O37&gt;Orsborne, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; During the following ten years, Orsborne said his career included &quot;a bit of everything—rum-running, whaling, deep-sea trawling in the Arctic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1935, back in Grimsby, he became skipper of the former [[seine fishing]] boat ''Gipsy Love,'' which its owners, the Marstrand Fishing Company, had converted into a trawler.&lt;ref name= HDM20&gt;{{cite news|title= Orsborne's Own Story|newspaper= The Hull Daily Mail|date= 20 October 1936|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The name of this fishing boat is often given as ''Gypsy Love,'' but its registered name was ''Gipsy Love,'' [[Official number|ON]] 164394.&lt;ref name=MNL1936 /&gt;|group= n}}

=== Crew and vessel ===
In March 1936, for his second voyage in ''Gipsy Love,'' Orsborne attempted to engage the services of an experienced seaman, Alexander MacLean, to whom he confided that the trip might go further afield—perhaps to Bermuda or South America—but MacLean declined the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Girl Pat Case: Brothers On Trial|newspaper= Dundee Evening Telegraph|date= 19 October 1936|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orsborne offered the mate's berth to Harry Stone, a local seaman who did not possess a mate's ticket but was told by Orsborne that he could use MacLean's number.&lt;ref name= MG119&gt;{{cite news|title= The Voyage of the Girl Pat|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/484074483/341D52890B444A4PQ/2?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Manchester Guardian|date= 11 September 1936|page= 16}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other crew members were a Yorkshireman, Hector Harris, and a 17-year-old Scottish cook, Howard Stephens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Crew of the Girl Pat|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/481510048/341D52890B444A4PQ/27?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Observer|date= 21 June 1936|page= 20}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal crew was joined by Orsborne's younger brother James, a grocer, who had no formal status on board and was later classified as a stowaway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Brothers Charged With Stealing Girl Pat|newspaper= Dundee Evening Telegraph|date= 10 September 1936|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gipsy Love'' left Grimsby late in March 1936, supposedly to fish in the [[Dogger Bank]] area of the [[North Sea]], but within hours had returned to port with engine trouble. With the consent of the owners, Orsborne transferred stores and crew to another Marstrand vessel, the small trawler ''Girl Pat''; James Orsborne again joined them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Ocean Adventures of the Girl Pat|newspaper= Lincolnshire Echo|date= 10 September 1936|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in 1935 in [[Oulton Broad]], [[Suffolk]], ''Girl Pat'' was a vessel of 55 [[Gross register tonnage|gross registered tons]] (GRT), 19 [[Net register tonnage|NRT]].  She was {{convert|66|ft|m}} long, with a beam of {{convert|18.7|ft|m}}, a hold depth of {{convert|8.7|ft|m}}, and accommodation for six.&lt;ref name=MNL1936&gt;{{cite web|title= Mercantile Navy List 1936|url= http://www.crewlist.org.uk/data/viewimages.php?year=1936&amp;regtype=MNL&amp;page=595&amp;reference=34770&amp;name=GIRL%20PAT |work= Mercantile Navy list online| publisher= Memorial University Newfoundland|accessdate= 21 July 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Girl Pat Sold|newspaper= The Dundee Evening Telegraph|date= 3 October 1936|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources refer to her as a &quot;seine netter,&quot; suggesting that like the ''Gipsy Love'' she had been converted to trawling.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, Ch. 1 (Unpaginated – section: &quot;The Ocean At Our Doorstep&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; She was insured with underwriters for £3,000.&lt;ref name= HDM22&gt;{{cite news|title= Girl Pat: The Next Step|newspaper= The Hull Daily Mail|date= 22 June 1936|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her regular engineer, George Jefferson, was added to Orsborne's picked crew for the forthcoming voyage.&lt;ref name = times17936&gt;{{cite news|title= Voyage of the Girl Pat|url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS118435633&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|newspaper= The Times|date= 17 September 1936|page= 7}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voyage ==

=== First phase: Grimsby to Corcubión ===
''Girl Pat'' left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, when they entered the open sea, Orsborne assembled the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse and told them that this would not be a normal fishing trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Stone Tells of Talks in Wheelhouse|newspaper= The Dundee Evening Telegraph|date= 10 September 1936|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at [[Dover]] where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for [[pearls]].&lt;ref name= MG119 /&gt;
[[File:Edificios en Corcubión - Galiza.jpg|thumb|left|The northern Spanish town of Corcubión (photographed in 2011), where ''Girl Pat'' rested in April 1936]]
On 3 April the craft reached Dover, where Jefferson was taken ashore and given food and drink. When he returned to the harbour, ''Girl Pat'' had departed; the engineer returned in some confusion to Grimsby.&lt;ref name = times17936 /&gt; As ''Girl Pat'' sailed into the English Channel, Orsborne revealed to his crew that the vessel contained no charts, and that future navigation would be dependent on a cheap school atlas that he showed them.&lt;ref name = times21 /&gt; He changed details in the boat's log book, entering himself as &quot;G. Black,&quot; Stone as &quot;H. Clark,&quot; and James Orsborne as &quot;A. Black&quot;.&lt;ref name= MG119 /&gt; After anchoring off [[Jersey]] in the [[Channel Islands]] to await calmer weather, ''Girl Pat'' proceeded southwards through the [[Bay of Biscay]]. Orsborne ordered changes to the boat's appearance: the [[bowsprit]] was altered, and the fishing registration number on the side of the hull was blacked out. According to Stone, Orsborne indicated an itinerary that included [[Madeira]], the [[Canary Islands]], the African coast and, eventually, [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Opening of Girl Pat Trial|newspaper= The Aberdeen Journal|date= 20 October 1936|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Remarkable Evidence in Girl Pat Case|newspaper= The Nottingham Evening Post|date= 10 September 1936|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They might then sell the boat and share the proceeds.&lt;ref name= times119&gt;{{cite news|title= Voyage of the Girl Pat: Seaman's Story in Court|url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS184758059&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|newspaper= The Times|date= 11 September 1936|page= 11}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severe weather in the Bay of Biscay hampered progress and battered the small vessel, and on 12 April they took shelter in the small northern Spanish port of [[Corcubión]], where they stayed for around 14 days.&lt;ref name= Dex28&gt;{{cite news|title= Girl Pat Crew Buy Rice With Their Last Pennies|newspaper= Daily Express|date= 28 May 1936|pages= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Necessary repairs were carried out, and the boat was reprovisioned. Orsborne instructed that the accounts for these services, totalling £235, be sent to Marstrand's in Grimsby, as their punishment, he later said, for letting the boat be taken out with inadequate stores and equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestA&quot; /&gt;

Following Jefferson's return to Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but initially thought that he had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A Trawler Mystery: Where is the Girl Pat?|newspaper= The Portsmouth Evening News|date= 14 May 1936|page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were unconfirmed sightings of ''Girl Pat'' in the [[Baltic Sea]] and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or [[Barratry (admiralty law)|barratry]], and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters,&lt;ref name= HDM22 /&gt; when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that ''Girl Pat'' had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Lost Ship Reappears on High Seas|newspaper= Daily Express|date= 14 May 1936|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YP155&gt;{{cite news|title= Lookout Kept for Missing Fishing Boat|newspaper= The Yorkshire Post|date= 15 May 1936|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second phase: Corcubión to Dakar ===
[[File:Selvagem Pequena - 1ago04.jpg|thumb|Reefs on the deserted coastline of the Savage Islands]]
After ''Girl Pat'' left Corcubión, there was speculation in the port that Orsborne intended to fish in the waters around [[Gibraltar]], but there was no sighting of the vessel in that vicinity.&lt;ref name=YP155 /&gt; Stone later recalled that after sailing for some time, they arrived at some uninhabited islands—this is consistent with a probable sighting by the British liner [[SS Avoceta|SS ''Avoceta'']], which on 17 May reported seeing a vessel closely matching the trawler's description, anchored in the [[Savage Islands]]. This small uninhabited [[archipelago]], roughly {{convert|170|nmi|km}} south of Madeira and roughly the same distance north of the Canary Islands, had long been associated with stories of pirates' buried treasure, and news that ''Girl Pat'' had been seen there gave rise to press speculation that she was engaged on a hunt for treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Girl Pat &quot;Sighted&quot;: What Freighter Saw Off Lone Treasure Isle|newspaper= Daily Mirror|date= 19 May 1936|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Girl Pat's Wanderings: Latest|newspaper= The Dundee Evening Telegraph|date= 10 June 1936|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lloyd's of London]] sent a representative to [[Las Palmas]], to investigate the sighting;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Telegrams in Brief|newspaper= The Times|url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS253963956&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|date= 20 May 1936|page= 15}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; meanwhile ''Girl Pat'' made an unobserved call at [[Tenerife]] in the Canary Islands, where she was repainted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Girl Pat Odyssey|newspaper= The Hull Daily Mail|date= 10 September 1936|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving Tenerife, ''Girl Pat'' continued her journey southward, following the African coast. According to Stone's account, the crew went ashore at [[Port Etienne]] in [[French West Africa]] (now Nouadhibou, in Mauritania), leaving the boat unguarded. While they were away, marauders stole gear and provisions, leaving the crew almost destitute: &quot;All we had left to eat and drink were four bottles of water, a tin of corned beef, a bottle of lime juice and a tin of condensed milk&quot;.&lt;ref name= Dex28 /&gt; Leaving Port Etienne, they ran aground on a sandbank and were stranded for three days. Eventually they managed to refloat the vessel, and on 23 May were picked up by a pilot boat which brought them into the harbour at [[Dakar]], starving and exhausted.&lt;ref name= Dex28 /&gt;&lt;ref name= times2210&gt;{{cite news|title= Voyage of the Girl Pat|url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS151203670&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|newspaper= The Times|date= 22 October 1936|page= 9}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence alleged that the company was in poor financial shape, and that its ships were heavily mortgaged. Moore denied that he had made any such suggestion to Orsborne. The company, he insisted, was financially sound, the mortgages on its vessels were relatively low, and he had never discussed insured values with Orsborne.

Orsborne said that while the boat was sheltering in Jersey, he had suggested to the crew that they &quot;may as well make a holiday of it&quot;, and then proposed that they make a circle of the Atlantic Ocean before returning to Grimsby. There was no intention to fall in with Moore's scheme or to steal the vessel; they would &quot;thank the owners for the loan of the ship&quot; and return it.&lt;ref name= times2110 /&gt; Orsborne added that while they were in port at Corcubión, he was offered money for ''Girl Pat'', but turned it down.&lt;ref name= times2110 /&gt; Orsborne denied that he had tried to conceal his or the boat's true identity in Dakar, or had left the port to avoid enquiries—the sudden departure was due, he said, to troubles with the natives. Nor had he attempted to evade the authorities in Georgetown; his movements there had arisen from concern for the safety of his vessel, which was being jeopardised by the manoeuvres of the police launch.&lt;ref name= Glouc21&gt;{{cite news|title= Girl Pat Story Sold for £5000|newspaper= The Gloucestershire Echo|date= 21 October 1936|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Orsborne, giving evidence, said that he had learned from his brother about Moore's proposal to get rid of the boat, and had told George that he would be &quot;a darned fool&quot; even to consider the suggestion. He had stayed with his brother because &quot;I thought that if he was going to do anything crazy I might manage to prevent him&quot;.&lt;ref name= Glouc21 /&gt; Recalled to the witness box, Moore said that he had refused to employ James Orsborne because he considered him dishonest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Judge on Girl Pat Suggestion by Defence|newspaper= The Derby Evening Telegraph|date= 22 October 1936|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his closing speech, defence counsel said that the key to the case was whether the Orsborne brothers intended to deprive the owners permanently of their vessel. The evidence, he said, was more suggestive of a &quot;joy-ride half-way round the world&quot;, than of theft or anything more sinister. Prosecuting counsel argued that if the month's joy-ride was the innocent explanation, why had it been necessary to introduce into the case the unfounded allegations of proposed insurance fraud &quot;against men whose reputations were above suspicion?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Last Stages in Girl Pat Case|newspaper= The Nottingham Evening Post|date= 22 October 1936|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his summing up, the judge condemned the arrangements whereby the Orsbornes were receiving money from the press for the rights to their story. This was unwarranted and undesirable: &quot;Whether the two prisoners be guilty or innocent [of theft], the property of someone else was being used by them without permission&amp;nbsp;...George Orsborne clearly knew that he was acting directly against his employer's interests&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Girl Pat Case Verdict|url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS117649239&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|newspaper= The Times|date= 23 October 1936|page= 7}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury was out for only 35 minutes before returning guilty verdicts against both defendants.

=== Orsborne's alternative account ===
Thirteen years after the trial, in a memoir entitled ''Master of the Girl Pat'' published by Doubleday, George Orsborne provided a new context for the ''Girl Pat'' voyage. According to this narrative, he had been recruited in 1935 to work for [[Naval Intelligence Division|British Naval Intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Girl Pat'' venture was a secret assignment, connected with the imminent [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, pp. 115–17&lt;/ref&gt; Between the stops at Corcubión and Dakar, Orsborne claims, he carried out a mission to blow up a railway bridge in [[Spanish Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, pp. 122–26&lt;/ref&gt; The stops at Port Etienne, Dakar and elsewhere had been to receive further instructions from Naval Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, pp. 130–36&lt;/ref&gt; In this later account Orsborne changes crew names and other details: Stone becomes &quot;Fletcher&quot;, and his leaving the voyage in Dakar is recorded by Orsborne as a &quot;desertion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Orsborne's dates are inconsistent with the boat's known movements—he gives 26 June as the date of arrival in Dakar,&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; and the account he gives of his Old Bailey trial bears no relation to the published record.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Orsborne describes his stay in [[Wormwood Scrubs]] prison as &quot;a wonderful experience. I wouldn't have missed it for anything&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{Quote box|width=350px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote= It is difficult not to entertain a sneaking gratitude towards the two men whose curious and unsuccessful adventure has sent us all vicariously sailing on a desperate mission across tropic seas&amp;nbsp;... Apart from the length of their voyage and their happy-go-lucky methods, they maintained to the end an air that was at once tough and enigmatic. |salign = left|source= ''The Times'' leading article, 23 October 1936.&lt;ref name= timesedit&gt;{{cite news|title= Leading article: The Girl Pat|url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS252522327&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|newspaper= The Times|date= 23 October 1936|page= 15}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After the trial, the press and public remained broadly sympathetic to the Orsborne brothers. During the committal stages ''[[The Spectator]]'' had commented that the adventure &quot;had given romantic satisfaction to the whole world&quot; and that her captain had become a national hero. On the day after the sentencing, ''The Times'' leading article noted the public's sustained pleasure in the escapade.&lt;ref name=timesedit /&gt; Nearly 30 years later, in his social history of the between-the-wars years, [[Ronald Blythe]] portrayed the affair as an anti-establishment gesture, &quot;a colourful snook cocked in the face of some of the most soul-crippling officialdom ever experienced by ordinary men and women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blythe, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

While in prison, George Orsborne lent his name to a ghost-written account of the ''Girl Pat'' adventure, which repeated the claim that the vessel had been sent out inadequately equipped and provisioned. Marstrand's successfully sued the publishers, Hutchinsons, and two newspapers which had repeated the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Girl Pat: Owners Libel Action Settled|url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS67711045&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|newspaper= The Times|date= 5 February 1937|page= 4}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Girl Pat Libel Action: £400 for Former Owners|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/484343966/341D52890B444A4PQ/7?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Manchester Guardian|date= 14 January 1938|page= 15}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his release, Orsborne planned to make a single-handed transatlantic crossing in an open boat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Hull Man Challenges Girl Pat Skipper|newspaper= The Hull Daily Mail|date= 13 June 1938|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the trip was delayed, and finally cancelled when war began in September 1939.{{refn|According to Orsborne, a small sailing boat was built to his specification, capable of crossing from [[Southampton]] to New York in 60 days. Orsborne also records that the boat, the ''Little Elizabeth'', was destroyed during an air raid in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; |group= n}} Likewise, nothing came of an announcement in 1938 that Orsborne would lead an expedition to the Caribbean and up the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Girl Pat Skipper to Lead Expedition to Caribbean|newspaper= The Manchester Guardian|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/484560514/341D52890B444A4PQ/19?accountid=17321|date= 31 December 1938|page= 14}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1949 memoir ''Master of the Girl Pat'', George Orsborne records briefly that Stephens went straight back to sea after the adventure, that Harris drank up his share of the crew's newspaper money, and that &quot;Fletcher&quot; (Stone) emigrated to Australia. James Orsborne worked for a while in the Mediterranean, assisting refugees from the Spanish Civil War. Later he went to Canada. He was in Singapore when it [[Battle of Singapore|fell to the Japanese]] in February 1942, and was not heard from again.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborne, pp. 174–75&lt;/ref&gt; George Orsborne died on 23 December 1957, at [[Belle Île]] off the [[Brittany]] coast, while delivering a motor-cruiser from [[Nice]] to England.&lt;ref name= obit /&gt;
