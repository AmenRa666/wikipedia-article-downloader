Capt. Stewart Parker, the Command and Control Special Forces commander at Bagram Air Base during the battle, said of Rhyner: &quot;Rhyner is out of training less than a year and is in one of the most difficult situations ... it is an absolute testament to his character and the training these guys take. It tells me we are doing something right.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Commando saves lives in Afghanistan&quot;/&gt; During a [[Fox News]] interview with [[Glen Beck]], Beck asked Rhyner &quot;... there are only â€” what is it? â€” 192 people who have ever received the Air Force Cross ... How do you put that together in your head? I mean, you are in a very elite group.&quot; Rhyner simply replied with &quot;Any other combat controller put in the same situation would have performed in the same, exact way ... Credit that to the training we receive and the process that we go through to become a combat controller.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myguidon.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12399 |author=Brig.

[[File:SSgt Zachary Rhyner Air Force Cross.jpg|thumb|left|SSgt Zachary Rhyner receiving his Air Force Cross citation]]
The [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]] was presented to him by [[Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Michael B. Donley]]. Prior to presenting the award Donley stated to Rhyner &quot;Your actions are now and forever woven into the rich fabric of service, integrity and excellence that has connected generations of America's Airmen since the very inception of airpower, Rarely do we present an Airman with the Air Force Cross, let alone a Purple Heart, and with good reason. The Air Force Cross is reserved for those who demonstrate unparalleled valor in the face of insurmountable odds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedmil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Tech. Sgt.

His award citation reads:
{{quote|The President of the United States of America, authorized by Title 10, Section 8742, United States Code, takes pleasure in presenting the Air Force Cross to Senior Airman Zachary J. Rhyner, United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an armed enemy of the United States while serving with the 21st Special Tactics Squadron, at Nuristan Province, Afghanistan on 6 April 2008. On that date, while assigned as Special Tactics Combat Controller, Airman Rhyner executed a day rotary-wing infiltration with his Special Forces team to capture high-value insurgents in a village on the surrounding mountains. While climbing near vertical terrain to reach their objective, the team was attacked in a well-coordinated and deadly ambush. Devastating sniper, machine gun, and rocket-propelled grenade fire poured down on the team from elevated and protected positions on all sides, immediately pinning down the assault force. Without regard for his life, Airman Rhyner placed himself between the most immediate threats and provided suppressive fire with his M-4 rifle against enemy fire while teammates were extracted from the line of fire. Airman Rhyner bravely withstood the hail of enemy fire to control eight United States Air Force fighters and four United States Army attack helicopters. Despite a gunshot wound to the left leg and being trapped on a 60-foot cliff under constant enemy fire, Airman Rhyner controlled more than 50 attack runs and repeatedly repelled the enemy with repeated danger close air strikes, several within 100&amp;nbsp;meters of his position. Twice, his actions prevented his element from being overrun during the intense six-and-a-half-hour battle. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, Airman Rhyner reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;militarytimes1&quot;/&gt; }}
