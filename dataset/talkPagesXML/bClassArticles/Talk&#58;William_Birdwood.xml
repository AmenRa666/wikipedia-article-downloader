== Untitled ==
I located his service record on the Australian national archives. [http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp service record] of Birdwood from it I got the details of awards and dates also his wounding at gallipoli.. [[User:Gnangarra|Gnangarra]] 14:33, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

== merge articles ==
no question both are about the same person, i've already started merging information into the article [[User:Gnangarra|Gnangarra]] 02:33, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

:The tags are just to ensure no one wastes time editting the other article.  Once all useful material is merged, the tags are removed and the other article is made a redirect.  I will do it myself when I have the time, if you don't deal with it first. [[User:Gsl|Geoff/Gsl]] 02:49, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

::lol i already had :D  [[User:Gnangarra|Gnangarra]]

I've done some merging, but the chronology of the 2nd/3rd paragraphs of the Middle East section needs to be worked out.  (And clearly more general clean-up remains.)  [[User:Calliopejen|Calliopejen]] 05:59, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

== Where he lived... ==
I assume he lived in one of the grace and favour flats at [[Hampton Court Palace]]? --[[User:Counter-revolutionary|Counter-revolutionary]] ([[User talk:Counter-revolutionary|talk]]) 11:37, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

== Places named after Birdwood ==
There is a Birdwood Avenue in Balwyn, Victoria, Australia, surrounded by other streets with WWI names (Elliot St for Pompey Elliot, Tivey Pde for Edwin Tivey and AIF St)  I don't know of a reference that confirms the reason for the name however...

Hope this helps  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/58.175.113.5|58.175.113.5]] ([[User talk:58.175.113.5|talk]]) 13:51, 2 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Not an Australian peer ==
He had certain associations with Australia, but he was not born here, never lived here, and in no sense could he personally be called an Australian peer.  I'm removing the category.  --  [[User:JackofOz|JackofOz]] ([[User talk:JackofOz|talk]]) 05:40, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

== Birdwood family ==
Putting some notes here on sources for various members of the Birdwood family, as including them in this article would be too much and veering out of scope (what I've added may already go too far in that direction). The ones with articles are listed at [[Birdwood]]. The one that was a grandfather of William Birdwood was a British general in the Indian Army called Christopher Birdwood. Details of him, George Birdwood and Herbert Birdwood (the father of William Birdwood) can be found in the ''Dictionary of Indian Biography'' (1906) on [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y8AKI2nqPBQC&amp;pg=PA42 page 42] and [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y8AKI2nqPBQC&amp;pg=PA43 page 43]. Further details of the family can be followed from the entry for [http://www.thepeerage.com/p14261.htm#i142606 Christopher Birdwood] (the grandfather) at thepeerage.com. That also gives details of William Birdwood's brothers. Not sure if an article on the family or some of the other individuals without articles is justified, but there are sources out there. For this article, I would say just brief details of the immediate family (parents, siblings and children) unless sources say more. Whether this Birdwood knew the Labour peer (they shared a grandfather) and the Anglo-Indian naturalist uncle, I don't know. Sources stating that would be needed to really justify mentioning them here. His son married his second wife after his father died, so again that might not be strictly relevant here.

: What you have added looks fine. This article has already been assessed for quality so unsourced material should not be added now. I would agree that information should be limited to brief details of the immediate family. Best wishes. [[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 17:29, 4 January 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks. Sources seem thin on the ground for the birth years of his daughters. The son was old enough to serve in WWI. Some more details might be in Birdwood's autobiography ''Khaki and Gown'' (1941). He also published ''In my time: recollections and anecdotes'' (1946). I'm going to add those details and more from the ODNB article. The latest revision of that article is 2009, but the original article (also by [[Robert Rhodes James]]) dates from 1971, available [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/olddnb/31898 here] for those that can access it (James died in 1999 - at least some of the ODNB updates will be by an uncredited author). The father also has an ODNB entry, and the paternal branch of the family has its roots in Plymouth: Richard Birdwood (1745–1810), mayor of Plymouth in 1796. But I'll get back to William Birdwood now and add those extra details. [[User:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]] ([[User talk:Carcharoth|talk]]) 21:56, 4 January 2014 (UTC)</text>
