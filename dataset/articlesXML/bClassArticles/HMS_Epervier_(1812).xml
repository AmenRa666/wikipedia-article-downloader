'''HMS ''Epervier''''' was an 18-gun {{sclass-|Cruizer|brig-sloop}} of the [[Royal Navy]] built by Ross at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], [[England]], and launched on 2 December 1812. {{USS|Peacock|1813|6}} captured her in 1814 and took her into service. USS ''Epervier'' disappeared in 1815 while carrying dispatches reporting the signing of a treaty with the [[Dey of Algiers]].

==War of 1812==
''Epervier'' was commissioned in January 1813 under Commander Richard Walter Wales.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; On 20 August 1813, ''Epervier'' captured the [[schooner]] ''Lively'', which was sailing from St. Thomas to [[Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia|Halifax]].&lt;ref name=LG&gt;''London Gazette'', Issue 16837, 1 January 1814, p.20-1&lt;/ref&gt; Then one month later, on 20 September, she captured ''Active''.&lt;ref name=LG/&gt; Under her master, E. Altberg, ''Active'', of 390 tons (bm), was sailing from Gottenburg to Boston with a cargo of iron.&lt;ref name=Court&gt;Vice-admiralty court, Halifax (1911), p.96.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, ''Epervier'', {{HMS|Majestic|1785|2}} and {{HMS|Wasp|1812|2}} captured ''Resolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17115|date=2 March 1816|startpage=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October ''Epervier'' and {{HMS|Fantome|1810|2}} captured the American privateer, ''Portsmouth Packet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16992|date=11 March 1815|startpage=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had previously been ''[[Liverpool Packet]]'', a noted Nova Scotian privateer, and returned to successful privateering under the ''Liverpool Packet'' name after the British recaptured her. At the time of her capture, ''Portsmouth Packet'' was armed with five guns, carried a crew of 45, and had sailed from Portsmouth the previous day. Almost a month later, on 3 November, ''Epervier '' and ''Fantome'' captured ''Peggy'' of 91 tons (bm), W. O. Fuller, master, which was sailing from George's River to Boston with a cargo of timber and wood.&lt;ref&gt;Vice-admiralty court, Halifax (1911), p.145.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 23 February 1814 ''Epervier'' was cruising off Cape Sable, when she captured the American privateer-brig ''Alfred'', of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]].&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), p.304.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alfred'', which mounted 16 long 9-pounders and had a crew, variously described, as being of 94 or 108 men, surrendered without a fight.&lt;ref name=Court/&gt; (The British 38-gun frigate {{HMS|Junon|1810|2}}, under the command of Captain Clotworthy Upton, was in sight about {{convert|10|nmi}} to leeward.)&lt;ref name=James6/&gt; 

While returning to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] with ''Alfred'', Wales found out that some of his crew were plotting with the prisoners from ''Alfred'' to take over one or both vessels and escape to the United States. Wales continued on to Halifax, where he arrived two days later, having sailed through a gale to do so. There he notified his uncle, Admiral Sir [[John Borlase Warren]], the commanding officer of the station, that he didn't trust his crew. Warren dismissed Wales' concerns and she sailed on 3 March with the same crew.&lt;ref name=James6&gt;James (1837), Vol 6, p.291-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, pp.127.&lt;/ref&gt; She and the schooner {{HMS|Shelburne|1813|2}} sailed with a small convoy bound to Bermuda and the West Indies.&lt;ref name=James6/&gt; Before she left Halifax, Wales exchanged her two 6-pounder bow chasers and the carronade for her launch for two 18-pounder carronades.&lt;ref name=James6/&gt;

==Capture==
{{main|Capture of HMS Epervier}}
On 14 April ''Epervier'' sailed from [[Port Royal]], Jamaica, calling at Havana, where she took on board $118,000 in specie. She left Havana on 25 April bound for Halifax.&lt;ref name=James6/&gt; The 22-gun [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Peacock|1813|6}} captured ''Epervier'' off [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], on 29 April, during the [[War of 1812]]. ''Epervier''{{'}}s crew consisted mainly of invalids from the hospital, giving her the worst crew of any ship on her station.&lt;ref&gt;Gossett (1896), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the engagement ''Epervier'' suffered eight killed and 15 wounded, as well as extensive damage.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; &lt;ref group=Note&gt;One of the officers on board ''Peacock'' was [[Philip Voorhees|Philip Falkerson Voorhees]], future captain of {{USS|Congress|1841|6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==US service==

Despite the extensive damage inflicted in this engagement, [[John B. Nicolson]], ''Peacock''{{'}}s [[First Lieutenant]], was able to sail her to [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Following repairs, the US Navy took her into service as USS ''Epervier''.

''Epervier'', under Master Commandant [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]], sailed to join the Mediterranean Squadron under Commodore [[Stephen Decatur]], Jr., whose mission was to stop the harassment of American shipping by the [[Dey of Algiers]]. ''Epervier'' joined with {{USS|Guerriere|1814|2}}, {{USS|Constellation|1797|2}}, and {{USS|Ontario|1813|2}} in the [[Battle off Cape Gata]] on 17 June 1815, which led to the capture of the 44 (or 46)-gun frigate ''Meshuda'' (or ''Mashuda''). ''Epervier'' fired nine broadsides into ''Meshuda'' to induce her to surrender, after ''Guerriere'' had already crippled the Algerian vessel.

Two days later ''Epervier'' and three of the smaller vessels of the squadron captured the Algerine brig of war ''Estedio'', of twenty-two guns and 180&amp;nbsp;men, at the [[Battle off Cape Palos]]. After the conclusion of peace with Algiers, Decatur transferred Downes to ''Guerriere''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Fisk (1887-1900), Vol. 2, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss==

After the Dey signed a treaty, Decatur chose ''Epervier'', under Lieutenant [[John T. Shubrick]], ''Guerriere''{{'}}s former [[First Lieutenant|first lieutenant]], to carry a copy of the treaty and some captured flags to the United States. Captain Lewis, and Lieutenants Neale and [[John Yarnall]], came on board as passengers. ''Epervier'' sailed through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] on 14 July 1815 and was never heard from again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/sloops/epervier.htm DANF - ''Epervier'']&lt;/ref&gt; She may have encountered a hurricane reported in the Atlantic on 9 August 1815. In all, she was carrying 132 sailors and 2 marines.
