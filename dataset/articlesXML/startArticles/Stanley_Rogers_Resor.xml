==Life and career==
Born in [[New York City]], he was the son of [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]] and [[Stanley B. Resor]] (pronounced REE-zor), president of the [[J. W. Thompson]] [[advertising]] agency and one of the originators of the modern advertising industry. While still a teenager he changed his name from Stanley Burnet Resor Jr. to Stanley Rogers Resor.&lt;ref name=wpobit&gt;{{cite news|last=Shapiro|first=T. Rees|title=Stanley R. Resor, 94: Served as Army secretary during the Vietnam War|newspaper=Washington Post|date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The elder Resor graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1901, and his son followed him there after attending the [[Groton School]], and graduated from Yale in 1939, where he was tapped to join [[Scroll and Key]]. He went on to [[Yale Law School]] where he was a contemporary of [[Sargent Shriver]] (also a member of Scroll and Key), [[Gerald Ford]], and [[Cyrus Vance]] (who preceded him as Secretary of the Army and himself was a member of Scroll and Key and in the same year at Yale). Resor's education was interrupted by service as an Army officer in [[World War II]] (1942–1946), where he was awarded the [[Silver Star]], [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], and the [[Purple Heart]].

After the war he went to work on [[Wall Street]], and was made [[partnership|partner]] in the prominent [[Debevoise &amp; Plimpton]] law firm. In 1965 during the [[Vietnam War]], [[U.S. President|President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] appointed him [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] and he remained in the position under President [[Richard Nixon]] until 1971. In 1984, he was awarded the [[United States Military Academy|United States Military Academy's]] [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]].

During the 1970s he served&lt;ref&gt;Personal meeting with Resor in late 1980s, Chalmers Hardenbergh, editor of the Arms Control Reporter. Thomas Graham, Disarmament Sketches, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; as US ambassador to the [[MBFR]] (mutual and balanced force reduction) talks in Vienna, held between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Over time he grew critical of U.S. policy regarding [[nuclear weapons]], and was a member of and spokesperson for the Arms Control Association of America in 1997 when it protested [[NATO expansion]] into [[Eastern Europe]] based on concerns about the reaction of the [[Russia]]n government to perceived encroachment by [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eisenhowerinstitute.org/programs/globalpartnerships/securityandterrorism/coalition/usandnato/OpenLetter.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Debevoise &amp; Plimpton after he left government service and retired in 1991.

Resor married Jane Pillsbury of the [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] family in 1942 in a ceremony attended by [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Cyrus Vance]]. They had seven sons. After Jane's death in 1994 he married Louise Mead Resor in 1999.&lt;ref name=wpobit/&gt;

Throughout his life he was a strong supporter of education and the rule of law, particularly for protecting the rights of women, children, and minorities, preventing international conflict, and protecting the environment.
