and flying activity of a group of Tiger Moth restoration enthusiasts in Guelph,
Ontario.

==Seen in Indiana Jones?==
There's a plane that looks just like the tiger moth in Indiana Jones: the last crusade, only it's German. Is a German plane, or is it the tiger moth?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.163.95.117|86.163.95.117]] ([[User talk:86.163.95.117|talk]]) 19:41, 10 July 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Your favourite search engine would probably have found http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_types_of_aircraft_are_used_in_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade which says ''Biplane escaping from the airship is a De Havilland DH 82 Tiger Moth (British) and the German &quot;fighter&quot; is a Pilatus P2 (Swiss trainer)'' [[User:MilborneOne|MilborneOne]] ([[User talk:MilborneOne|talk]]) 19:54, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

== Disambiguation ==
Moved the disambiguation page back in keeping with [[WP:MOSDAB]].  Aim is to remove (disambiguation) suffixes.  Even if most searches go to the plane there is still a choice of aircraft articles. - &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ex nihil|Ex nihil]] ([[User talk:Ex nihil|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ex nihil|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:Can you explain please? No idea what you are referring to (I do understand DAB pages).

::I believe what [[User:Ex nihil]] is trying to say is that [[Tiger moth (disambiguation)]] has now been moved to [[Tiger moth]] instead, including links to this page. It is a bit fuzzily written! - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 01:09, 28 August 2009 (UTC)

:::Ah, same thing but (disambiguation) missing. I can sleep soundly now! It's an aircraft BTW, not a 'plane' Sheesh!

==Inconsistency==
Sections: Operational History and Variants are inconsistent as for naming of DH.60T and DH.82. Which one was Tiger Moth I? [[User:Pibwl|Pibwl]] [[User_talk:Pibwl|&amp;larr;&amp;laquo;]] 23:11, 9 July 2010 (UTC)

:Hopefully fixed now, the main problem was that the first 35 aircraft ordered were stated as being designated DH.60T where they were actually DH.82s. Have clarified in the variants section as well and cited both facts. [[User:Nimbus227|Nimbus]] [[User talk:Nimbus227|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#2F4F4F;&quot;&gt;(Cumulus &lt;font style=&quot;color:#708090;&quot;&gt;nimbus &lt;font style=&quot;color:#D3D3D3;&quot;&gt;floats by)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:23, 10 July 2010 (UTC)

::&quot;DH.60T&quot; was the factory designation of the modified [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|DH.60]] machine built for the 13/31 [[List of Air Ministry specifications|Specification]] and the one submitted by DH for it.

==Ureverted Flying Section==

I have unreverted the flying section arbitrarily removed by Bzuk.  I have added a few references, and tidied it up a bit.  But the original was fine IMHO.  If Bzuk or others wish to improve the article then that would be most welcome.  But to just revert without any discussion is not reasonable.  Comments from other people that have actually flow a Tiger would be appreciated.  [[Special:Contributions/118.208.60.188|118.208.60.188]] ([[User talk:118.208.60.188|talk]]) 09:00, 10 December 2010 (UTC)

:It was removed because it appears to be mostly [[WP:OR|original research]] and contained no [[WP:CITE|citations]]. I part-own a Tiger Moth and have operated it for the last four years. I have pasted the section in below and added my comments in italics:

The Tiger Moth is easy to fly ''(disagree)'' and responds wells to control input (''roll control is poor, all controls have heavy forces)''.  Its big &quot;parachute&quot; wings are very forgiving (''untrue, spins easily, no pre-stall buffet''), and it stall as slow as 25 knots with power ''(possibly but I wouldn't advise anyone trying this)''.  It has some adverse yaw, and so requires rudder input during turns.&lt;ref name=RAAF&gt;Pilote's Notes for Tiger Moth Aircraft, R.A.A.F Publication No 416, February 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a tail dragging bi-plane, taxiing requires care.  The pilot cannot see directly ahead, the lower wing can hit obstructions, and it is susceptible to gusts of wind on its inclined, large, upper wing (''wind is not a problem when taxiing apart from trying to taxi crosswind as it will try to 'weathercock' into wind and if you are having trouble with directional control then it should be put back in the hangar)'' .  The take of is uneventful,''(incorrect, yaws quite markedly to the right)'' and it has a reasonable rate of climb.  However, full power should not be maintained for more than a minute or so to avoid damaging the engine.''(incorrect, engine can be held at full power indefinitely but I agree that it is not desirable to do this, there is an rpm limit however for diving flight)''

The Tiger Moth's biplane design makes it strong, and it is fully aerobatic.''(incorrect, classed as semi-aerobatic, can not maintain inverted flight)''  But surprisingly, it only has ailerons on its bottom wing, which makes it rate of role relatively slow for a biplane.  Most manouvers are started at about 90 to 110 knots, and it has a VNE of 140 knots.

&quot;Wheeler&quot; landings are straight forward, as the plane is pushed on to the runway at a moderate speed with just the front wheels on the ground,''(can be tipped on its nose, care required)'' and then the tail is held up until the speed reduces.  Being an open cockpit the pilot can stick his head over the side to see the runway.''(Should be 'has to'!)''

Three point landings are difficult because there is insufficient elevator authority to pull the plane into a proper three point position.(''Incorrect, has enough elevator authority to land tailskid first)''  Instead, the aircraft must be flaired several metres above the ground, then allowed to drop before sharply bring the stick back.(''this technique would break the undercarriage'')  If done correctly the resultant angular momentum will bring the tail down far enough to land on all three points.

This section would need to be re-written to comply with [[WP:NOTGUIDE]] and more specific citations added. That said I think there should be a flying section for the reader's benefit but it needs to be accurate. The RAAF notes do not give this level of detail but Bramson's book has an accurate account of flying a Tiger. Cheers [[User:Nimbus227|Nimbus]] [[User talk:Nimbus227|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#2F4F4F;&quot;&gt;(Cumulus &lt;font style=&quot;color:#708090;&quot;&gt;nimbus &lt;font style=&quot;color:#D3D3D3;&quot;&gt;floats by)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 09:38, 10 December 2010 (UTC)

:The Tiger Moth was liked by [[RAF Training Command]] and RAF instructors as it's flying qualities had the merit of 'weeding-out the inept' trainee pilots  before valuable time was wasted on training them. A more docile aeroplane would not have done this.</text>
