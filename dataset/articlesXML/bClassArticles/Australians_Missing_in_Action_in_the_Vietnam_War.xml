At the end of the [[Vietnam War]], six Australians were among the 2,338 people then listed as [[missing in action]]. Four [[Australian Army]] soldiers and two [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) were classified &quot;missing in action&quot; in four separate incidents with all six presumed to have been [[killed in action]]. Following the war, the remains of the servicemen were recovered and repatriated to Australia. As of 30 July 2009, no Australian servicemen remain missing in action from the Vietnam War.

==Personnel listed as missing in action==
* Lance Corporal Richard Harold John (&quot;Tiny&quot;) Parker (24) and Private Peter Raymond Gillson (20), were both regular army soldiers with A Company, [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] attached to the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (United States)|US 173rd Airborne Brigade]]. On 8 November 1965, during fighting at [[Battle of Gang Toi|Gang Toi]] as part of [[Operation Hump]] in [[Bien Hoa Province]], both soldiers were observed by their comrades to be hit repeatedly by enemy machine-gun fire at close range. Despite attempts by other soldiers, their bodies could not be recovered, owing to heavy enemy fire which pinned down their company. The remains of Parker and Gillson were located in southern Vietnam in April 2007 and were repatriated to Australia in June that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Our-work/Unrecovered-War-Casualties-Army/Vietnam/Remains-of-two-Australian-soldiers-discovered-2007 |title=Remains of two Australian soldiers discovered, 2007 |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/vietnam_mia/index.asp |title=Australian servicemen listed as missing in action in Vietnam |work=Encyclopedia |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=19 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722090254/http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/vietnam_mia/index.asp |archivedate=22 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Private David John Elkington Fisher (23), was a [[Conscription in Australia|national serviceman]] serving with 3 Squadron, [[Special Air Service Regiment]]. On 27 September 1969, he was part of an SAS patrol which was contacted by several parties of [[Viet Cong]] in the Cam My district, about {{convert|35|km|mi}} northeast of the [[1st Australian Task Force]] base at [[Nui Dat]]. During a &quot;hot extraction&quot; by an RAAF helicopter, Fisher fell about {{convert|30|m|ft}} into dense jungle from a rope attached to the helicopter. He was believed to have been killed and searches failed to recover his body. In August 2008, the [[Australian Defence Force]] reported that the possible location of Fisher's body had been identified.  On 11 September 2008, the Australian Defence Force advised that the remains found as part of the investigation had been positively identified as Fisher and that preparations were underway to return the fallen soldier with full military honours. &quot;It is now known that Private Fisher died as a result of the fall and was hastily buried by enemy soldiers who discovered his body&quot;, Defence Science and Personnel Minister [[Warren Snowdon]] stated.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/minister/74tpl.cfm?CurrentId=8212 |title=Private David Fisher to Return Home |date=11 September 2008 |author=Snowdon, Warren |work=Media Release |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/remains-found-in-vietnam-of-digger-missing-in-action-for-39-years-20080911-4et4.html |title=Remains found in Vietnam of digger missing in action for 39 years |work=The Age |author=Nelson, Brendan |date=12 September 2008 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pilot Officer Robert Charles Carver (24) and Flying Officer Michael Patrick John Herbert (24), of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF]], were both career air force officers based at [[Phan Rang Air Base]]. On 3 November 1970, during a night bombing mission their [[Canberra bomber]], serial no. A84-231, disappeared in the northern [[I Corps Tactical Zone]] region of [[South Vietnam]] after dropping its bombs near [[Da Nang]]. An extensive aerial search of the area failed to find any trace of the aircraft or crew and was called off after three days. On 21 April 2009, the Australian Defence Force reported they had located the wreckage of an RAAF Mk 20 Canberra bomber in thick jungle in an extremely rugged, remote and sparsely populated area of [[Quang Nam Province]], Vietnam, near the [[Laos|Laotian]] border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2009/Apr/20090421/index.htm |title=Image Galleries 2009 |publisher=Department of Defence |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Government announced on 30 July 2009 that the remains of the airmen were found in the wreckage of the crashed bomber and that they had been positively identified as belonging to Carver and Herbert. The two airmen were the last of the Australians listed as missing in action in Vietnam to be repatriated to Australia.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raafa.org.au/2sqn-crew-mia-vietnam |title=2 SQN Crew MIA Vietnam |publisher=RAAF Association |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lance Corporal John Francis Gillespie (24) was a helicopter medic with the [[8th Field Ambulance (Australia)|8th Field Ambulance]]. On 17 April 1971, Gillespie took part in a &quot;[[medical evacuation|dustoff]]&quot; operation in the [[Long Hai]] hills in Phuoc Tuy province to rescue a wounded South Vietnamese soldier. The RAAF [[UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1H Iroquois]] helicopter (Serial No A2-767) from [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF]] he was a passenger in was hit by enemy ground fire and crashed. Gillespie was pinned under the burning wreckage and his body could not be recovered. Three other soldiers also died in the crash. In February 2004, remains believed to be those of Gillespie were located, and they were positively identified and repatriated to Australia on 22 December 2007.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Our-work/Unrecovered-War-Casualties-Army/Vietnam/Remains-of-Lance-Corporal-Gillespie-discovered-2007 |title=Remains of Lance Corporal Gillespie discovered, 2007 |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
