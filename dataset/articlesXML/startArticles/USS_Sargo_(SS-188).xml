'''USS ''Sargo'' (SS-188)''', the [[lead ship]] of [[Sargo class submarine|her class]] of [[submarine]], was the first ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the [[sargo]].

Her [[keel]] was laid on 12 May 1937 by the [[Electric Boat]] Company in [[Groton, Connecticut]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 6 June 1938 sponsored by Mrs. Catherine V. Nimitz, wife of Captain [[Chester W. Nimitz]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 7 February 1939, Lieutenant E. E. Yeomans in command.

==Sargo batteries==

''Sargo'' was the first vessel equipped with a new [[lead-acid battery]] designed by the [[Bureau of Steam Engineering]] (BuEng) to resist battle damage, based on a suggestion by her commissioning [[commanding officer]], Lieutenant E. E. Yeomans.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly became known as the &quot;Sargo battery&quot;. Instead of a single hard rubber case, it had two concentric hard rubber cases with a layer of soft rubber between them. This was to prevent [[sulfuric acid]] leakage in the event one case cracked during [[depth charge|depth-charging]]. Leaking sulfuric acid would be capable of corroding steel, burning the skin of crew members it came into contact with, and if mixed with any seawater in the bilges would generate poisonous [[chlorine gas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/S/a/Sargo_class.htm The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia, ''Sargo''-class article]&lt;/ref&gt; This remained the standard battery design until replaced with Sargo II and GUPPY batteries in submarines upgraded under the [[Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program]] after [[World War II]]. Each battery's capacity was slightly increased by installing 126 [[electrochemical cell|cells]] instead of 120; this also raised the nominal voltage from 250 [[volt]]s to 270 volts, which has been standard in US usage ever since, including the backup batteries of [[nuclear submarine]]s.

==Pre-war service==
After shakedown along the eastern seaboard of [[South America]], ''Sargo'' departed [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], in July 1939 for duty with the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]. Transiting the [[Panama Canal]], she arrived at [[San Diego, California]], in mid-August. She operated in the eastern and mid-Pacific for the next two years, including a practice 40-day war patrol between [[Midway Island]] and the [[Marshall Islands]] in the fall of 1941. She departed [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] on 23 October 1941, arrived in [[Manila]] on 10 November, and was there when the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December.

==War patrols under Tyrell D. Jacobs==
The next day (under the command of torpedo specialist [[Tyrell D. Jacobs]], Class of 1927),&lt;ref&gt;He was one of a handful of &quot;Gun Club&quot; members to try and fix the numerous problems of the notorious Mark 14 torpedo, following bitter personal experience. Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory'' (Lippincott, 1975), p.140 &amp; 902.&lt;/ref&gt; the submarine got underway for her first war patrol, which took her along the coast of [[French Indochina]] and to the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. Off the major Japanese base at [[Cam Ranh Bay]], [[Ultra|&lt;small&gt;ULTRA&lt;/small&gt;]] directed her to three [[cruiser]]s on 14 December, which ''Sargo'' was unable to gain position to attack when they appeared as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.139-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Expecting a [[convoy]], she went in closer, and that night detected a freighter, firing one torpedo; it [[premature explosion|prematured]] eighteen seconds later. Confidence in the [[Mark VI exploder|Mark VI]] shaken, she switched to [[contact pistol]] afterward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.140&quot;&gt;Blair, p.140.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December, she found two freighters, firing two torpedoes at one, one at the other, from about {{convert|1000|yd|-2}}, scoring no hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.140&quot;/&gt; Temporarily losing depth control, she [[Broach (sailing)|broached]], and the target turned away; ''Sargo'' fired two stern tubes at {{convert|1800|yd}}, with no more success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.140&quot;/&gt; The next day, she sighted a pair of merchantmen, but was unable to gain firing position. Some time afterward, she came on two more merchantmen and fired two stern torpedoes at the rearmost of them, from closer yet, {{convert|900|yd|-2}}; both again missed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.140&quot;/&gt; By now frustrated, after eight torpedoes with zero results, when two additional merchantmen came in view an hour later, ''Sargo'' took extra pains to get it right, pursuing for fifty-seven minutes&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.141&quot;&gt;Blair, p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; and making certain [[Torpedo Data Computer|TDC]] bearings matched perfectly before firing two torpedoes at each ship, at an average of 1000&amp;nbsp;yards; all missed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.140&quot;/&gt;

After her skipper discovered the torpedoes were running too deep, and correcting the problem,&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.141. [[Bureau of Ordnance]] (BuOrd) would wait months to do the same.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sargo'' detected a target at dusk on 26 December&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.141&quot;/&gt; losing, then regaining, contact, and running ahead, so be able to get good position. Then weather intervened, and the ships escaped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.141&quot;/&gt;

A few days afterward, a big, slow tanker gave ''Sargo'' another opportunity, and again, the approach was meticulous, firing one torpedo at a close {{convert|1200|yd}}. It missed. In exasperation, ''Sargo'' signaled headquarters, questioning the [[Mark 14 torpedo|Mark 14]]'s reliability&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.140&quot;/&gt; on an open radio circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs' courage here is exemplary, recalling [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|Ned Beach]]'s a generation later in relation to {{USS|Tang|SS-563|2}}-class' terrible &quot;pancake&quot; diesels. It could have gotten him [[court martial]]led for insubordination, and he knew it, not to mention being detected by the Japanese. On his return, he was upbraided by his commanding officer, Admiral [[John Wilkes (naval officer)|John Wilkes]]. Blair, p.169.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 1942, she assisted in the rescue of the crew of [[USS S-36 (SS-141)|''S-36'']] after she ran aground on [[Taku Reef]] in the [[Makassar Strait]]. ''Sargo'' remained surfaced, relaying distress messages to friendly aircraft and surface ships. After the rescue by the Dutch merchant ship ''Siberote'', ''Sargo'' headed for [[Java (island)|Java]], and arrived at [[Soerabaja]] on 25 January.

Here, she offloaded all her reload torpedoes (keeping only those in her tubes)&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.174&quot;&gt;Blair, p.174.&lt;/ref&gt; and three-inch ammunition, and took on one million rounds of .30-caliber ammunition desperately needed by Allied forces in the [[Philippines]]. She sortied 5 February, avoiding the usual traffic lanes, and arrived in [[Polloc Harbor]] nine days later. After delivering her vital cargo to [[Mindanao]], she returned to [[Soerabaja]] with 24 [[Boeing B-17]] specialists&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.174&quot;/&gt; from [[Clark Field]] on board.

Sailing from Soerabaja on 25 February, she headed for [[Australia]] and was one day out of [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] when she was attacked by an Australian plane which mistook her for a Japanese submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunn|first=Peter|title=US SUBMARINE ATTACKED BY A HUDSON BOMBER OF 14 SQUADRON RAAF OFF THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN COAST|url=http://www.ozatwar.com/friendlyfire/ussub01.htm|work=www.ozatwar.com|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.185. This sort of mistake would become depressingly common during the war. For instance, Blair, pp.210 and 285, just in the first half of 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a near miss by a bomb caused minor damage, ''Sargo'' arrived safely at Fremantle on 5 March with 31 passengers from [[Java (island)|Java]].&lt;ref&gt;The Australian bombing would be the last straw for Jacobs, who went to shore duty at BuOrd. Blair, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War patrols under Richard V. Gregory==

During March, amid the panic over potential Japanese invasion of Australia, ''Sargo'' (now commanded by [[Richard V. Gregory]], Class of 1932)&lt;ref&gt;This made him the youngest officer so far to command a [[fleet submarine|fleet boat]]. Blair, pp.185, 192, 285, &amp; 906.&lt;/ref&gt; was detailed to guard [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]]'s approaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.192&quot;&gt;Blair, p.192.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing materialized.

On 8 June, ''Sargo'' put to sea for her fourth patrol, conducted in the [[Gulf of Siam]] off [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. She attacked only one target, a small tanker, with only three torpedoes, but failed to score, then returned to Australia on 2 August.

The fifth war patrol, from 27 August to 25 October, was in the [[Celebes Sea]] and [[South China Sea]]. In a submerged attack off [[Vietnam]], [[French Indochina]], on 25 September, she fired two torpedoes at the 4,472-ton cargo ship ''Teibo Maru''. When these did not sink the target, three more were fired; all missed, including one [[circular run|circular]], which exploded off her stern,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.192&quot;/&gt; presaging another deadly failing of the Mark 14. ''Sargo'' then surfaced and finished off the crippled freighter with gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;When ''Sargo'' returned, Gregory was removed. Blair, p.286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War patrols under Edward S. Carmick==

[[Image:SargoSS188-MareIsland.jpg|thumb|left|''Sargo'' moored at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], 28 April 1943. Raised metal &quot;188&quot; is seen in faint relief on port bow. White outlines mark recent alterations]]
On 29 November, she departed [[Brisbane]] and conducted her sixth patrol (now commanded by [[Edward S. Carmick]], Class of 1930)&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.921.&lt;/ref&gt; ''en route'' to [[Hawaii]]. On the last day of 1942, she made a submerged attack on an enemy tanker off [[Tingmon Island]], firing a spread of four torpedoes. Heavy explosions were heard, accompanied by grinding noises usually associated with a ship breaking up. [[JANAC]] did not confirm the sinking. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 January 1943 and proceeded to [[San Francisco Bay]] for a three-month overhaul in the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]].

Returning to Hawaii on 10 May, she departed on 27 May for her seventh patrol which took her to the [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]]-[[Guam]]-[[Saipan]] shipping lanes. On 13 June, she intercepted a three-ship convoy, escorted by a subchaser. That night, she made a submerged attack, sinking the passenger-cargo ship ''Konan Maru'' southeast of [[Palau]]. The next day, she fired torpedoes at another of the cargo ships but could not learn the results of her attack, since she was forced to dive to escape the subchaser's [[depth charge]]s. ''Sargo'' arrived at [[Midway Island]] on 9 July, where she was credited with one ship sunk for 6,600&amp;nbsp;tons (reduced postwar to 5,200).&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.931.&lt;/ref&gt;

She departed Midway on 1 August for her eighth war patrol, again at Truk and in the [[Mariana Islands]]. She made no contacts and returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 September for refit.&lt;ref&gt;Not unexpectedly, Carmick was relieved. Blair, p.939.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War patrols under Philip W. Garnett and post-war fate==

On her ninth war patrol (now commanded by [[Philip W. Garnett]], Class of 1933),&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.939&quot;&gt;Blair, p.939.&lt;/ref&gt; 15 October to 9 December, ''Sargo'' operated off [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and in the [[Philippine Sea]]. On 9 November, she torpedoed the cargo ship, ''Tago Maru'', southeast of Formosa, and finished off the stricken ship with gunfire. Steaming north, she torpedoed and sank the passenger ship, ''Kosei Maru'' two days later east of [[Okinawa]]. Afterwards, she picked up a Japanese soldier, clinging to floating debris, survivor of another sinking. ''Sargo'' returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 December 1943, credited with two ships for 15,900&amp;nbsp;tons; postwar, it was 6,400.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.939&quot;/&gt;

''Sargo''’s tenth patrol, 26 January to 12 March 1944, was conducted north of the [[Palau Islands]]. Despite &lt;small&gt;ULTRA&lt;/small&gt; alerting her, she failed to be in position to intercept Admiral [[Mineichi Koga|Koga]] when he appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.570-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, she made four attacks and fired all her torpedoes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.571&quot;&gt;Blair, p.571.&lt;/ref&gt; She sank the transports ''Nichiro Maru'' (6,500 tons)&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.571&quot;/&gt; on 17 February and ''Uchide Maru'' (5,300&amp;nbsp;tons)&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair, p.571&quot;/&gt; on 29 February; this time, the wartime credit, one ship of 7,000&amp;nbsp;tons, remarkably, increased.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.942.&lt;/ref&gt;

After refit in Pearl Harbor, the veteran submarine departed on her eleventh war patrol on 7 April, along the southern coasts of [[Kyūshū]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Honshū]]. On 26 April, she torpedoed and sank the cargo ship ''Wazan Maru'' in [[Kii Suido]], approaching [[Osaka Bay]]. She returned to [[Pearl Harbor]] on 26 May and steamed east to the west coast of the [[United States]] for a major overhaul at [[Mare Island Navy Yard]].

Returning to [[Hawaii]] in September, ''Sargo'' got underway for her 12th patrol on 13 October and operated off the [[Bonin Islands]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]]. Two trawlers were damaged by ''Sargo''’s three-inch (76&amp;nbsp;mm) deck gun and machine guns.

On arrival at [[Majuro Atoll]], [[Marshall Islands]], on 7 December 1944, she was assigned to training submarine crews until 13 January 1945, when she proceeded to [[Eniwetok Atoll]]. There she acted as a target for [[antisubmarine warfare|ASW]] training. As the war ended, she returned ''via'' Hawaii to the [[United States]], arriving at [[Mare Island]] on 27 August. Decommissioned on 22 June 1946, she was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 19 July 1946. Her hulk was sold for scrap on 19 May 1947 to the [[Learner Company]] of [[California]].

''Sargo'' was awarded eight [[battle star]]s for her service in [[World War II]] and received the [[Philippine Presidential Unit Citation]].
