[[File:SS Yellowstone builder's yard.jpg|300px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;SS ''Yellowstone'' in 1918, probably at or near her builder{{'}}s yard in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], and prior to her [[Ship commissioning|commissioning]] as USS ''Yellowstone''.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The first '''USS ''Yellowstone'' (ID-2657)''' was a [[cargo ship]] of the [[United States Navy]] that served during [[World War I]] and its immediate aftermath.

== Construction and acquisition ==

The [[Moore and Scott Shipbuilding Company]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]] [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] a steel-hulled, single-[[Propeller|screw]] commercial cargo ship originally named SS ''Passatt'', SS ''War Boy'', or SS ''War Buoy''{{efn|The ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' gives the ship{{'}}s original name as ''War Boy'';&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; Navsource.org gives it as ''War Buoy'',&lt;ref name=NavSource /&gt; and the Naval History and Heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images stated that &quot;Earlier names reported for this ship were ''Passatt'' and ''War Boy'' or, more likely, ''War Buoy''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Photos /&gt;}} on 9 December 1917.  Renamed SS ''Yellowstone'', she was completed in April 1918 and came under the control of the [[United States Shipping Board]].&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/y/yellowstone-i.html|title=Yellowstone I |accessdate= 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Photos&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-civil/civsh-xz/yelstone.htm |archivedate= December 8, 2013 |archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131208091233/http%3A//www%2Ehistory%2Enavy%2Emil/photos/sh%2Dcivil/civsh%2Dxz/yelstone%2Ehtm |publisher= Naval History and Heritage Command |department= Online Library of Selected Images: Civilian Ships |title= S.S.

The U.S. Navy{{'}}s [[12th Naval District]] inspected ''Yellowstone'' with an eye toward using the ship as a depot [[Collier (ship)|collier]] during [[World War I]] and her assigned the identification number 2657. She steamed from California to [[Philadelphia]], where the Navy took control of her for operation with the [[Naval Overseas Transportation Service]]. She was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] at the [[shipyard]] of [[William Cramp and Sons]] in Philadelphia as USS ''Yellowstone'' (ID-2657) on 21 September 1918 with [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Lawrence Dodd, [[USNRF]], in command.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Photos /&gt;&lt;ref name=NavSource /&gt;
== Navy service ==

Soon after her commissioning, ''Yellowstone'' moved to [[New York City]], where she arrived on 24 September 1918. She underwent repairs at the [[Morse Drydock and Repair Company]] yards in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and suffered additional damage in a minor sideswiping collision with the British-registered [[merchant ship]] ''Moorish Prince'' on 13 October 1918. After repairs to the damage she suffered in her collision with ''Moorish Prince'', ''Yellowstone'' shifted to Pier 5 at [[Bush Terminal – Industry City|Bush Terminal]] in Brooklyn on the morning of 15 October 1918 and over the next few days took on board 6,672 tons of general cargo – including automobiles and [[locomotive]]s – earmarked for American forces in [[France]].&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

On 27 October 1918, ''Yellowstone'' got underway in [[convoy]] for France, &quot;proceeding under confidential orders on [United States] [[United States Army|Army]] transport duty to port of debarkation,&quot; [[St. Nazaire]]. The war ended on 11 November 1918 while ''Yellowstone'' was en route to France. On 14 November 1918 she arrived at [[Quiberon Bay]]. She remained at anchor there until she received onward routing to St. Nazaire. There, she discharged her cargo and began taking on &quot;return&quot; cargo for transport to the [[United States]], including &quot;aeroplane parts.&quot; After shifting briefly to the St. Nazaire roadstead, ''Yellowstone'' departed the French coast, proceeding independently, on 27 November 1918.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Photos /&gt;

On 15 December 1918, only two days from New York, ''Yellowstone'' sighted a derelict three-masted [[schooner]] and altered course to close. She discovered the water-logged ''Joseph P. Cooper'' of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]], abandoned with her decks and cabin awash and with her forerigging gone and her [[forecastle]] smashed in. ''Joseph P. Cooper'' looked like she had been adrift from six to eight weeks. After leaving the derelict, ''Yellowstone'' continued her passage and arrived at Pier 5, Bush Terminal, in Brooklyn on 17 December 1918. Shifting to Pier 1 at the end of December, she spent a week at anchor off the [[Statue of Liberty]] before returning to Bush Terminal and, later, shifting to the U.S. Army docks at Brooklyn. There, from 17 to 25 January 1919, ''Yellowstone'' took on board 5,150 tons of supplies and, on 25 January 1919, got underway for France.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Photos /&gt;

During the crossing, ''Yellowstone'' ran into a heavy [[gale]] on 4 February 1919. She rolled considerably at the outset, shipping water and spray amidships, and labored heavily in the storm. On 9 February 1919, with the storm still showing no signs of abating, ''Yellowstone''{{'}}s steering gear failed. Soon both auxiliary systems – steam- and hand-powered – also failed. Pumping oil through waste pipes in an attempt to break the force of the waves, ''Yellowstone'' wallowed through the storm while her engineers worked to repair the casualty. By 12 February, ''Yellowstone'' was once again able to use her steering gear effectively.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

''Yellowstone'' anchored at Quiberon Bay at 0953 on 14 February 1919. Her troubles were not over, however, as she grazed the [[jetty]] wall while entering the [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] at St. Nazaire. At 0545, the engineer officer reported to the captain that two [[boiler]]s were under water and the steam was cut off. As ''Yellowstone'' moored alongside the nearby [[quay]], her crew broke out a [[tarpaulin]] and collision mat. Soon thereafter, ''Yellowstone'', still with way on, nudged into the bridge walk of the lock. By 0630, under tow by a French [[Tugboat|tug]], she reached a safe basin, where she dropped both anchors and her crew began to take stock of the situation. Divers examining the damage reported that a hole, six inches (15.2&amp;nbsp;cm) in width, had been opened up in ''Yellowstone''{{'}}s side, extending from a point 10 feet (3 meters) beneath the [[waterline]] and about six feet (1.8 meters) in length. [[Drydock]]ed on 11 March 1919, ''Yellowstone'' grazed the French [[passenger ship]] SS ''Alesia'' that morning, causing minor damage to ''Alesia''{{'}}s railings on her [[promenade deck]] and [[boat deck]].&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Undocked upon completion of her hull repairs on 6 April 1919, ''Yellowstone'' loaded a return cargo of structural iron for use as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]], [[barbed wire]], and 6-inch (152-mm) [[artillery]] pieces. On 19 April 1919, she shifted from St. Nazaire to [[Brest, France|Brest]], France, and got underway the next day for the United States. Mooring at Pier 3, Bush Terminal, Brooklyn, on 7 May 1919, she unloaded through mid-month.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Photos /&gt;

== Decommissioning and transfer ==

At noon on 24 May 1919, a United States Shipping Board crew reported aboard ''Yellowstone'', and, at 1247 that day, ''Yellowstone'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] and simultaneously stricken from the [[Navy list]] and returned to the Shipping Board.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Photos /&gt;&lt;ref name=NavSource /&gt;{{efn|Although both official Navy sources give the date of decommissioning as 24 May 1919, Navsource.org gives it as 7 May 1919,&lt;ref name=NavSource /&gt; apparently confusing her arrival date at Bush Terminal with her decommissioning date 17 days later.}}

== Later career ==
Once again SS ''Yellowstone'', the ship entered commercial service under the control of the Shipping Board. On 10 December 1920,{{efn|The ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' states that the ship had a &quot;short career&quot; after her decommissioning and ran aground on 10 December 1929,&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; a date indicating over 10 years of post-decommissioning commercial service and inconsistent with a &quot;short&quot; career. The Naval History and Heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images corrects the date to 10 December 1920,&lt;ref name=Photos /&gt; and Navsource.org also states a stranding date of 10 December 1920.&lt;ref name=NavSource /&gt;}} she dragged her anchors due to high winds and ran hard aground off [[Ponta Delgada (Azores)|Ponta Delgada]] on [[São Miguel Island]] in the [[Azores]]. She was listed as &quot;stranded&quot; and a total loss, but her entire crew of 45 men was saved.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Photos /&gt;
