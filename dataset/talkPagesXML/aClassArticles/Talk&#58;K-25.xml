==Closure==
Though there is a &quot;Closure and Demolition&quot; section, nothing whatsoever is said about its closure.  Why was this building closed?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.6.26.39|24.6.26.39]] ([[User talk:24.6.26.39|talk]]) 03:48, 7 September 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Largest building==

Is it really larger than the Pentagon building? The list of world's largest buildings has the pentagon listed as slightly larger and the article on the Palazzo seems to corroborate this. Taking the info out until it's confirmed. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/137.240.136.81|137.240.136.81]] ([[User talk:137.240.136.81|talk]]) 15:26, 20 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt; 

:Sometimes such arguments lead to silly contrary statements such as the above -- because there are more than one way to calculate the size of a building. One way is by the number of cubic meters (or cubic feet) of space that it encloses, for which factory buildings such as the K-25 building rate high, because they have very high ceilings. Another way is by their number of square meters (or square feet) of floor &quot;space&quot; that they have. The Pentagon building (an office building) rates high on this because it is a multi-story (about five) building with relatively-low ceilings, so you get lots of floor space in a smaller volume. Note that in this case, the &quot;Pentagon&quot; is always capitalized, because that is the proper name for that building, similar to the &quot;Empire State Building&quot;, &quot;Independence Hall&quot;, or the &quot;Astrodome&quot;.&lt;br/&gt; 
:In any case, and beyond any question, the K-25 plant, when completed, was the world's largest single factory building. It also remained that way until the [[Boeing Corporation]]'s factory building in Everett, Washington, was completed in the late 1960s for the purpose of building Boeing 747 jumbo jets inside it.&lt;br/&gt;
:Also, the world's largest single building (and I believe still is) in terms of volume inclosed was the Vertical Assembly Building that was constructed at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida in the 1960s for assembling [[Saturn V rocket]]s. It has the capacity for the assembly of five Saturn Vs at once, though that many never were there all at the same time.[[Special:Contributions/98.67.164.50|98.67.164.50]] ([[User talk:98.67.164.50|talk]]) 07:23, 22 November 2009 (UTC)

==Info from Y-12 article==

Someone posted this info to [[Y-12 National Security Complex]].  I've never heard of K-25 being part of Y-12, so I'm moving the text here.  Please incorporate it as you see fit.  --[[User:Amcbride|Allen]] 01:52, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

:K-25, another building in the Y-12 Complex, was the largest building in the world when built. The people needed for the construction of the building lived near by, in a community that came to be known as Happy Valley. Built by the army in 1943, Happy Valley was a temporary community that housed 15,000 people in trailor homes. The building had 2 million squre feet of workspace and was a half mile long. It required 35 miles off electrical wire and used roughly the same amount of water needed for a city with a population of 25 million. A team of 12,000 was needed just to look for leaks in the pipes that were used in the enrichment process, which had to be air tight. The building was used to process 100 tons of uranium.

P.S. I went ahead and pasted in the two sentences about Happy Valley, since there certainly should be something about Happy Valley in the article.  --[[User:Amcbride|Allen]] 01:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

:You're right: The K-25 plant has nothing to do with Y-12, and there is actually a significant drive in a car between the two (like 25 minutes long). They aren't even in the same county, with Y-12 being in Oak Ridge in [[Anderson County, Tennessee]], whereas, the K-25 plant was in the next county to the west, [[Roane County, Tennessee]]  [[Special:Contributions/98.67.164.50|98.67.164.50]] ([[User talk:98.67.164.50|talk]]) 07:04, 22 November 2009 (UTC)

==A Redirect to this article is needed==

A redirect to this article is needed: the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant.&lt;br/&gt;
The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant is mentioned in several other Wikipedia articles, such as on uranium enrichment, nuclear weapons, yellowcake uranium, and so forth.[[Special:Contributions/98.67.164.50|98.67.164.50]] ([[User talk:98.67.164.50|talk]]) 07:04, 22 November 2009 (UTC)


== Inclusion into the National Parks System ==

It would be good to include mention of the plans to have the K-25 site converted to a National Parks Service Heritage Site.  The article at http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2012/may/18/demolition-versus-preservation-k-25-plan-still-a/ should be a good starting place for reference.

== Uranium enrichment by calutrons ==

Should not the uranium enrichment by calutrons be mentioned?
Was not all the Little Boy material made with this methode?

== Orphaned references in [[:K-25]] ==

I check pages listed in [[:Category:Pages with incorrect ref formatting]] to try to fix reference errors. One of the things I do is look for content for [[User:AnomieBOT/docs/OrphanReferenceFixer|orphaned references]] in wikilinked articles. I have found content for some of [[:K-25]]'s orphans, the problem is that I found more than one version. I can't determine which (if any) is correct for ''this'' article, so I am asking for a sentient editor to look it over and copy the correct ref content into this article.

&lt;b&gt;Reference named &quot;Beaton1962&quot;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From [[Gaseous diffusion]]: {{cite journal|author=Beaton L|title=The slow-down in nuclear explosive production|journal=[[New Scientist]]|volume=16|issue=309|pages=141–3|year=1962|pmid=|doi=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pp8mxf-9E_sC&amp;pg=PA141 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From [[Methoxyflurane]]: {{cite journal|author=Beaton L|title=The slow-down in nuclear explosive production|journal=New Scientist|volume=16|issue=309|pages=141–3|year=1962|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pp8mxf-9E_sC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=%22The+slow-down+in+nuclear+explosive+production%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20slow-down%20in%20nuclear%20explosive%20production%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I apologize if any of the above are effectively identical; I am just a simple computer program, so I can't determine whether minor differences are significant or not.
