There's been a lot of discussion about naming of military hardware generally... does this request reflect any of that? [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 20:34, 20 April 2010 (UTC)

:Until launch of the first ship the ship class will not be known hence has to use the Project name. All warships are grouped into their class they belong. In this case the first ship name is Kamorta and hence it become &quot;Kamorta class corvette&quot; which is the standard followed in Wikipedia as well.

== Blacklisted Links Found on the Main Page ==

Cyberbot II has detected that page contains external links that have either been globally or locally blacklisted.
Links tend to be blacklisted because they have a history of being spammed, or are highly innappropriate for Wikipedia.
This, however, doesn't necessarily mean it's spam, or not a good link.
If the link is a good link, you may wish to request whitelisting by going to the [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist|request page for whitelisting]].
If you feel the link being caught by the blacklist is a false positive, or no longer needed on the blacklist, you may request the regex be removed or altered at the [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-blacklist|blacklist request page]].
If the link is blacklisted globally and you feel the above applies you may request to whitelist it using the before mentioned request page, or request its removal, or alteration, at the [[meta:Talk:Spam Blacklist|request page on meta]].
When requesting whitelisting, be sure to supply the link to be whitelisted and wrap the link in nowiki tags.
The whitelisting process can take its time so once a request has been filled out, you may set the invisible parameter on the tag to true.
Please be aware that the bot will replace removed tags, and will remove misplaced tags regularly.

'''Below is a list of links that were found on the main page:'''

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:2|one external link|2 external links}} on [[Kamorta-class corvette]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=700728080 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20090218144842/http://bharat-rakshak.com:80/NAVY/ships/future/188-project-28.html to http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/ships/future/188-project-28.html

== Contradicting sources ==

Hello and thanks for the help {{u|Adamgerber80}}. I included the 16 cell VLS for Barack 1 having originally gotten the info from [http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/kamorta-class-asw-corvettes/ this source], but I wonder which one's true after seeing the [http://aermech.in/ins-kamorta-indias-first-indigenous-built-anti-submarine-stealth-corvetteswarshipindian-navy/ aermech source]. Regards—[[User:UY Scuti|&lt;font color=&quot;CornflowerBlue&quot; face=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;'''UY Scuti'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:UY Scuti|&lt;font color=&quot;Green&quot; face= &quot;Times&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:51, 18 August 2016 (UTC)

Hey {{u|UY Scuti}}, there is some bit of contention on this issue. One thing I can confirm is that none of the ships currently in service are fitted with SAM's([http://www.janes.com/article/57037/indian-navy-commissions-second-kamorta-class-asw-corvette|Source 1],[http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ins-kadmatt-commissioned-dhowan-stresses-on-indigenisation/180557.html|Source 2],[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-ins-kamorta-all-you-need-to-know-about-india-s-indigenous-warship-2013021|Source 3]). There have been differing media reports on the proposed SAM's but the conclusion is not clear since the Indian Navy is yet to decide(or make the decision public). The sources you point to mention Barak 1 and then are sources which point to Barak 8 as well [http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/barak-8-missile-test-indian-navy/1/558885.html|Source 1]. There are other sources which claim that the French made MICA would be fitted on these ships.[http://www.manilalivewire.com/2016/04/the-reasons-why-philippines-decided-to-buy-the-karmota-class-frigate-of-india/|Source 1] which is based on this article [https://defencyclopedia.com/2015/09/18/kamorta-class-analysis-of-indias-deadly-anti-submarine-corvette/|source](a pretty good analysis but not backed by sources). AFIAK, the source you can really trust is an Indian Navy press release or IHS Janes. My guess(I am not a naval expert here but have been following the Indian Navy for quite some time) is that these ships will be fitted with Barak 8 or the new SR-SAM which India is currently considering during their first refit. Barak-1 SR-SAM is a good system but a decade old and the Indian Navy would prefer a modern system which can serve for the next two decades. Barak-8 LR-SAM is a good alternative but might be an overkill for a ship this size. India has been negotiating with the French on the VL MICA system for quite some time now(since 2012 from media reports) and it seems to be the best fit for these class of ships. Plus, the IAF also operates MICA and has been reasonably please with their performance. To conclude, I would remove the missiles from the armament list for now but do mention these alternatives in the armament section(I do mention Barak-8 there with the reference). It can be added at a later stage when we have an actual press release from the Indian Navy. Thanks. [[User:Adamgerber80|Adamgerber80]] ([[User talk:Adamgerber80|talk]]) 01:23, 19 August 2016 (UTC)
