{{Campaignbox Norwegian Campaigns (1941 - 1945)}}
On 9&amp;nbsp;February 1945, a force of Allied [[Bristol Beaufighter]] aircraft suffered heavy casualties during an unsuccessful attack on the German destroyer ''[[German destroyer Z33|Z33]]'' and its escorting vessels; the operation was labelled &quot;'''Black Friday'''&quot; by the surviving Allied aircrew. The German ships were sheltering in a strong defensive position in [[Førde Fjord]], [[Norway]], forcing the Allied aircraft to attack through heavy [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] fire. The Beaufighters and their escort of Mustang IIIs ([[North American P-51 Mustang]]) fighters from the RAF's No. 65 Squadron were also intercepted by twelve German [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] fighters of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighter wing [[Jagdgeschwader 5]]. In the resulting attack, the Allies damaged at least two of the German ships for the loss of seven Beaufighters shot down by [[anti-aircraft warfare|flak guns]]. Another two Beaufighters and one Mustang were shot down by the Fw 190s. Four or five German fighters were shot down by the Allied aircraft, including one flown by German Ace [[Rudi Linz]].

The decision to attack ''Z33'' and her escorts rather than a nearby group of merchant ships was in accordance with [[RAF Coastal Command|RAF Coastal Command's]] orders from the British [[Admiralty]]. The heavy casualties sustained in the raid led to merchant ships being prioritised over destroyers and small warships in subsequent operations. In addition, another [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] of P-51 Mustangs was assigned to protect Allied aircraft operating near Norway from German fighters.

==Background==
{{see also|RAF Coastal Command during World War II}}

Due to Allied victories in France and Eastern Europe, Germany's surface shipping was largely confined to the lower [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and Norwegian waters by late 1944. This left ports in Norway as Germany's last remaining bases to continue the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] and conduct trade with [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Goulter (1995), pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt; When the Baltic iced over during the winter of 1944–45, Germany was forced to transport its vital imports of Swedish [[iron ore]] from the port of [[Narvik]] in northern Norway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milson_50&quot;&gt;Milson (2010), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the growing importance of German maritime transport routes through Norwegian waters, the [[Royal Air Force|Royal Air Force's]] Coastal Command transferred seven squadrons of anti-shipping aircraft from bases in eastern [[England]] to northern [[Scotland]] during September and October 1944. Three squadrons equipped with [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] light bombers were stationed at [[RAF Banff]] while a [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] made up of four squadrons operating Beaufighter heavy fighters was based at [[RAF Dallachy]]. The Dallachy Wing comprised the British [[No. 144 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;144 Squadron]], Canadian [[No. 404 Squadron RCAF|No.&amp;nbsp;404 Squadron]], Australian [[No.&amp;nbsp;455 Squadron RAAF|No. 455 Squadron]] and New Zealand [[No.&amp;nbsp;489 Squadron RNZAF|No. 489 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=Milson_50 /&gt; These four squadrons were veterans of many anti-shipping operations over the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Herington (1963), pp. 368–373&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:455 Sqn RAAF Pilots Nov 1944.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Six young men wearing flying suits standing in front of a World War II-era twin engined monoplane|Some of No. 455 Squadron's aircrew posing in front of a Beaufighter at RAF Dallachy in November 1944]]

Attacks by the Banff Wing quickly forced German ships travelling along the Norwegian coast to sail at night and take shelter in deep fjords during the day where they were very difficult to attack. In order to locate German ships the two wings sent out aircraft on almost daily patrols along the Norwegian coastline from the [[Skagerrak]] to [[Trondheim]]. During this period the Allied squadrons developed a tactic of sending two 'outriders' ahead of the main body of the patrol; these aircraft were manned by experienced aircrew and penetrated into fjords in search of shipping which might not be spotted by the other aircraft. By December 1944 patrols were also routinely escorted by RAF Mustang Mk III fighters and accompanied by [[Vickers Warwick]] air-sea rescue aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Herington (1963), pp. 373–376&lt;/ref&gt; Only a single squadron of Mustangs was available, however, as these long-ranged fighters were needed to escort daylight raids by [[heavy bombers]] against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Roskill (1961), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; German fighters began to be encountered off the Norwegian coast in December, and from the end of the month onwards it was common for Allied wing-sized operations near Norway to be attacked by groups of up to 30 fighters. In March 1945 the [[Luftwaffe]] had 85 single-engined and about 45 twin-engined aircraft operating from ten or twelve airfields south of Trondheim.&lt;ref&gt;Goulter (1995), pp. 245–246&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first weeks of 1945 the Allied strike wings flew few operations due to severe weather.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milson_51&quot;&gt;Milson (2010), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; On 15&amp;nbsp;January, the Banff Wing was intercepted by 30 Fw&amp;nbsp;190 fighters from the III.&amp;nbsp;Gruppe of [[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (III./JG 5) during a raid on the town of [[Leirvik]]. In the resulting fighting five Mosquitos and five Fw&amp;nbsp;190s were shot down.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman (1997), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; By 9&amp;nbsp;February, the Ninth and Twelfth Squadrons of JG5 were based at [[Herdla]] near [[Bergen]], about {{convert|65|mi|km}} to the south of Førde Fjord. These units were equipped with Fw&amp;nbsp;190s and the Twelfth Squadron was commanded by [[Second Lieutenant|Leutnant]] [[Rudi Linz]], a 28-year-old flying ace with 69 'kills' to his credit.&lt;ref&gt;Conyers Nesbit (1995), pp. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt;

The German {{sclass2|Narvik|destroyer}} ''Z33'' entered service in February 1943. She served in Norwegian waters from July of that year and saw combat on several occasions. She was the last German destroyer to leave northern Norway, and sailed for Germany on 5 February 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koop_114&quot;&gt;Koop and Schmolke (1995), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended that [[German destroyer Z31|''Z31'']], which had completed initial repairs at Bergen after being heavily damaged in the [[Action of 28 January 1945]], would join her to make a joint passage to the Baltic.&lt;ref&gt;Roskill (1961), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Z33'' ran aground in Brufjord on 7&amp;nbsp;February, damaging her port shaft and propeller and causing both engines to fail. She was subsequently taken under tow to be repaired in Trondheim.&lt;ref name=Koop_114 /&gt; ''Z33'' and the two [[tugboat]]s that were towing her chose to shelter in Førde Fjord during the daylight hours of 9 February while en route to Trondheim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry_47&quot;&gt;Parry (2002), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==

===Preliminaries===
[[File:German destroyer Z33 in Forde Fjord 9 Feb 1945 wide angle.jpg|thumb|alt=Two ships close to the shore of a body of water near steep snow-covered hills. Much of the body of water is covered by sheets of ice.|''Z33'' and another German ship in the position they sailed to after being detected on the morning of 9&amp;nbsp;February 1945]]
On the morning of 9&amp;nbsp;February, two New Zealand-crewed Beaufighters from No.&amp;nbsp;489 Squadron conducted a patrol of the Norwegian coast. These aircraft first sighted a 1,500-ton merchant ship in [[Stong Fjord]]. Continuing north, they were surprised to find a ''Narvik''-class destroyer accompanied by a [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] and two [[flak ship]]s in [[Førde Fjord]]. The aircraft continued their patrol and spotted five large merchant ships in the Nord Gulen and two minesweepers and a flak ship near [[Bremanger]].&lt;ref&gt;Conyers Nesbit (1995), p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the pilots' surprise, the Allied command was aware that ''Z33'' was in the area from [[Ultra]] signals intelligence.&lt;ref name=Milson_51 /&gt;

The Dallachy Wing was on alert to attack any ships found by the reconnaissance patrol. Although the group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable to attack and a worthwhile target, Coastal Command came under the operational command of the Admiralty and was bound by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;CN_220&quot;&gt;Conyers Nesbit (1995), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (2009), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the wing was dispatched against ''Z33'' even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and in a difficult position for aircraft to attack.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (2009), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Wing Commander Jack Davenport, who had commanded No.&amp;nbsp;455 Squadron until October 1944 and was now on the staff of [[No. 18 Group RAF]], planned the attack on ''Z33''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (2009), pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt; The plan called for two 'outriders' to precede the main force and confirm the location of the German ships. The Beaufighters would then arrive to the east of the German anchorage, turn to the west and attack the ships before escaping over the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milson_53&quot;&gt;Milson (2010), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Davenport sought to minimise Allied casualties, but the location of the German ships in a narrow and protected fjord meant that the operation was inherently risky.&lt;ref name=Alexander_182 /&gt; The strike leader was Wing Commander Colin Milson, the 25-year-old commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;455 Squadron, and a veteran of anti-shipping operations against Italian and German ships in the Mediterranean and North Seas.&lt;ref name=Milson_51 /&gt; Milson had reservations about making what was likely to be a costly raid, particularly given that the war was clearly coming to an end, but carried out the order to attack ''Z33'' to the best of his ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;CN_221&quot;&gt;Conyers Nesbit (1995), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

After being spotted, the German ships in Førde Fjord sailed further up the fjord and prepared for an Allied attack. ''Z33'' and several of her escorts anchored close to the steep southern slopes of the fjord near the village of [[Bjørkedal]]. Meanwhile, other ships moored near the northern shore after breaking up pack ice with gunfire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milson_52&quot;&gt;Milson (2010), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CN_224&quot;&gt;Conyers Nesbit (1995), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|def|(I)}} This anchorage was also protected by flak batteries on the shore of the fjord.&lt;ref name=CN_225 /&gt;

===Attack===
At 1:30&amp;nbsp;pm on 9&amp;nbsp;February, Milson led 31 or 32 Beaufighters into the air from Dallachy. The strike force was joined by either ten or twelve P-51 Mustang fighters from [[No. 65 Squadron RAF]] and two [[Vickers Warwick|Warwick]] [[air-sea rescue]] aircraft from [[No. 279 Squadron RAF]] carrying life rafts to help any aircrew forced to ditch.&lt;ref name=Milson_51 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CN_221 /&gt;{{ref|def|(II)}} All four of the Dallachy Wing's squadrons contributed aircraft to the force.&lt;ref name=CN_221 /&gt; The No. 404 and No. 455 Squadron Beaufighters were armed with [[RP-3|&quot;60lb&quot; rockets]] while the aircraft from No. 144 Squadron and the single No. 489 Squadron Beaufighter dispatched were armed only with their four [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20 mm cannon]] and six machine guns.&lt;ref name=Parry_47 /&gt;
[[File:German ship under attack in Forde Fjorde 9 February 1945.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A ship sailing on a body of water amidst lumps of ice and explosions in the water|A German ship under attack in Førde Fjord]]

After the attackers crossed the Norwegian coastline at 3:40&amp;nbsp;pm, two Beaufighters from No.&amp;nbsp;144 and No.&amp;nbsp;489 Squadrons detached themselves from the main force and pressed ahead as outriders.&lt;ref name=Milson_52 /&gt; The two 'outriders' crossed Førde Fjord near where the German ships had been sighted that morning. At 3:50&amp;nbsp;pm they sent Milson a radio message stating that they could not see the ships. The 'outriders' then turned to the east and overflew the town of [[Førde]] before searching the next fjord to the north; during their flight near Førde Fjord they did not spot the German warships in their new position.&lt;ref name=Milson_53 /&gt; Meanwhile, the Ninth and Twelfth Squadrons of JG5 were scrambled from Herdla at 3:50&amp;nbsp;pm and ordered to attack the Dallachy Wing and its escorts.&lt;ref name=&quot;CN_225&quot;&gt;Conyers Nesbit (1995), p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Several minutes later, the main body of the raid reached the southern shore of Førde Fjord travelling north. To their surprise, the Allied planes passed directly over the German ships and came under intense attack from anti-aircraft guns, though no aircraft were hit.&lt;ref name=Milson_53 /&gt; In response, Milson wheeled his force to the right in an attempt to attack the ships from east to west as planned. The steep walls of the fjord protected ''Z33'' from attack from this direction, however.&lt;ref name=Milson_53 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CN_224 /&gt; As a result, Milson led the force west to near the mouth of the fjord and ordered the Beaufighters to attack in relays from west to east. This required the aircraft to fly into the face of alerted German defences and then escape over steep mountains.&lt;ref name=Milson_53 /&gt; The narrow confines of the fjord also meant that the Beaufighters had to attack individually from a single direction and would not be able to swamp the German defences as they normally sought to do.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goulter_254&quot;&gt;Goulter (1995), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Milson led the first group of Beaufighters into Førde Fjord at about 4:10&amp;nbsp;pm. His aircraft escaped undamaged after attacking a flak ship and other Beaufighters followed him into the fjord.&lt;ref name=CN_224 /&gt; At about this time 12 Fw&amp;nbsp;190s arrived at Førde Fjord and flew through German flak to intercept the Beaufighters that were waiting their turn to attack. The British Mustangs were taken by surprise, but dived to intercept the German fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;CN_225&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milson_54&quot;&gt;Milson (2010), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an intense air battle, with over 50 aircraft either engaged in [[dogfight]]s or diving to attack the German ships; it was the largest aerial conflict ever fought over Norway.&lt;ref name=Milson_54 /&gt;

The fighting continued until 4:25&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=Milson_54 /&gt; By that time the German ships had shot down seven Beaufighters. Fw 190As had claimed another two Beaufighters and a Mustang III.&lt;ref name=Goulter_254 /&gt; The Allied losses included six of the eleven No.&amp;nbsp;404 Squadron aircraft involved in the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenhous_473&quot;&gt;Greenhous (1994), p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the Germans killed 14 Allied airmen and took four [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref&gt;Conyers Nesbit (1995), pp. 226–228&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies damaged ''Z33'' and several of the other German ships and shot down either four or five Fw&amp;nbsp;190s.&lt;ref name=Greenhous_473 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milson (2010), pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CN_228&quot;&gt;Conyers Nesbit (1995), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|def|(III)}} Linz and another German pilot were killed.&lt;ref name=Milson_54 /&gt; ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' fatalities included four sailors on ''Z33'' and three on the converted [[Naval trawler|trawler]] ''VP6808''; both of these ships were damaged during the attack. There may also have been fatalities on the other German ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry_50&quot;&gt;Parry (2002), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:144 Sqn RAF Beaufighter 9 Feb 1945.jpg|thumb|alt=A twin-engined World War II-era monoplane lying on its belly on grass. Both of its propellers are twisted and another aircraft is flying near the ground behind it.|A No.&amp;nbsp;144 Squadron Beaufighter which made a [[belly landing]] at RAF Dallachy after suffering damage from ''Z33'' and a Fw 190]]

After departing the Førde Fjord area, the surviving Beaufighters, many of which were damaged, returned to RAF Dallachy. Several had difficulty making safe landings, and two were forced to land on their bellies due to [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] damage, but no further aircraft were lost. The air and ground crew were shocked by the scale of the losses, and the battle became known as &quot;Black Friday&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Conyers Nesbit (1995), pp. 228–230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milson_55&quot;&gt;Milson (2010), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The losses suffered by the Dallachy Wing on 9&amp;nbsp;February were the highest any of Coastal Command's strike wings sustained in a single operation during the war.&lt;ref name=Goulter_255/&gt;

The German fighters, many of which were short of fuel and ammunition, also broke off at about 4:25&amp;nbsp;pm and returned to base. On the night of 9/10&amp;nbsp;February, the German ships left Førde Fjord and continued their journey to Trondheim. A subsequent Allied attack on the ships by a different strike wing was also unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Milson_55/&gt; ''Z33'' arrived in Trondheim on 11&amp;nbsp;February and was repaired. She subsequently departed for Germany on 26&amp;nbsp;March and safely arrived in [[Świnoujście|Swinemünde]] on 2 April. She did not see any further combat, and was decommissioned at [[Brunsbüttel]] in late April as the Navy lacked the fuel needed to operate her.&lt;ref name=Koop_114/&gt;

The losses incurred during the raid on Førde Fjord led to changes in the tactics used by RAF Coastal Command's anti-shipping squadrons. Following the attack, the Admiralty agreed to a proposal by Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]], the commander of Coastal Command, to assign a higher priority to attacking merchant vessels than to destroyers and small warships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goulter_255&quot;&gt;Goulter (1995), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; A second squadron of Mustangs was also assigned to protect Coastal Command aircraft operating near Norway from early March.&lt;ref name=Greenhous_473 /&gt; Milson was awarded a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his [[Distinguished Service Order]] on 13 July 1945 for his leadership and personal courage during the raid on Førde Fjord, which was described in the citation as a &quot;brilliantly executed operation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37175|date=13 July 1945|startpage=3619|supp=yes|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raid was commemorated in Norway after the war. A monument to the aircrew killed in the battle was dedicated in the town of Førde on 8&amp;nbsp;May 1985, the 40th anniversary of Norway's liberation. This monument was later moved to [[Bergen Airport, Flesland|Bergen Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander_182&quot;&gt;Alexander (2009), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Combat Museum in the town of [[Naustdal]] also houses photos, maps, aircraft parts and other artifacts relating to the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naustdal|url=http://www.gonorway.com/norway/counties/sogn-and-fjordande/naustdal/763b49b7c067149/|work=goNorway|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luftkampmuseet |url=https://www.naustdal.kommune.no/Artikkel.aspx?AId=142&amp;back=1&amp;MId1=19&amp;MId2=80&amp;MId3=86|work=About Naustdal |publisher=Naustdal Kommune|accessdate=18 November 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Focke-Wulf Fw&amp;nbsp;190 fighters of JG 5 that flew against the RAF Beaufighters and Mustangs survive to this day — one, an F-model airframe with factory serial number, or ''Werknummer'' of 931&amp;nbsp;862, that crashed as a result of the &quot;Black Friday&quot; aerial engagements was found and recovered as a salvageable aircraft wreck in September 1983. It currently resides in [[Stow, Massachusetts]], and had been under restoration by the &quot;White 1 Foundation&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.white1foundation.org/ Homepage of the &quot;Weisse 1&quot; Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Kissimmee, Florida]] towards a resumption of full flightworthy status, until its 2012 transfer to the [[Collings Foundation]]'s facilities in the Bay State to complete the work towards full flightworthy status. While still in Florida, in 2005 its last pilot, the former ''Luftwaffe'' ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' Heinz Orlowski visited it and sat one final time in the cockpit of his &quot;under-restoration&quot; Fw&amp;nbsp;190F-8, some sixty years after he last flew it and five years before his death in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.white1foundation.org/history_blackfriday.htm |title=Black Friday - 9. February 1945 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other example, an Fw&amp;nbsp;190A-8 bearing the ''Werknummer'' 732&amp;nbsp;183 was flown by Luftwaffe 70-victory ace [[Rudi Linz]] in the engagement. His Fw&amp;nbsp;190A-8 is displayed in the Cottbus Hangar of the [[Military Aviation Museum]] in [[Pungo, Virginia]], USA as of 2014.

The locations of several of the Beaufighter planes—gravesites—were found by marine archeologist [[Rob Rondeau]] and diving crew 60 years later. One site was given a commemorative plaque, in the presence of one surviving Canadian airman, Herbert (Bert) Ramsden, who participated in the action, and a sister of an airman who died there.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Secrets of the Deep:  WWII Beaufighters&quot; Season 2 Episode 1 (available [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE0leR6WlA4 here on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;
