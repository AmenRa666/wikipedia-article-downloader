== Opening sentence ==
{{DONE}}

Interesting article, possibly, but the opening sentence tells me nothing. &quot;The Singapore strategy was a strategy of the British Empire between 1919 and 1941.&quot; You would not start an article, &quot;The battleship ''USS Nimrod&quot; was an American battleship.&quot;

A strategy about what? -[[User:Fjozk|Fjozk]] ([[User talk:Fjozk|talk]]) 07:01, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
:What wording do you suggest as an improvement? [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 07:03, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
::Anything that elaborates on strategy rather than just replacing it; you know the old school rule, you don't define a word by saying that it is what it is. I made an edit that I think will work. -[[User:Fjozk|Fjozk]] ([[User talk:Fjozk|talk]]) 07:10, 2 November 2012 (UTC)

OK, I was hoping someone would tie it to the second sentence in the manner Ed did. Thanks. Can the main page be changed to reflect this much better opening sentence? -[[User:Fjozk|Fjozk]] ([[User talk:Fjozk|talk]]) 07:16, 2 November 2012 (UTC)

Actually, I think the first sentence is fine - if one does not know what the USS Nimrod was, then defining it as a battleship is informative. similarly, the Singapore Strategy could have been a Japanese strategy, or a British strategy of the 19th century.  

Later in the article, in &quot;Base Development&quot;, it is stated that the area of the shipyard was 21 sq miles.  This seems rather large since only 2845 acres (4.44 sq miles) was donated. can this be checked?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/99.24.217.10|99.24.217.10]] ([[User talk:99.24.217.10|talk]]) 17:53, 2 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:It does not check against the reference, so I have removed the sentence. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 20:55, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
::Maybe &quot;the ''USS Nimrod'' was an American boat,&quot; then is a better example, but to the point of this opening sentence, it's not just using that it's British, it's that it's easy and straightforward to say what type of strategy it was, war contingencies, as strategy is such a vague word, and not just that's it's British, but repeating the word in the same sentence added nothing, and was poor reading. It has been rewritten to be a much better sentence by elaborating on what type of strategy, war plans rather than light bulb installing or tulip growing agriculture, in addtion to the British. I don't think anyone is going to offer that the vague, say nothing, open sentencing should be returned to the lead of this article.-[[User:Fjozk|Fjozk]] ([[User talk:Fjozk|talk]]) 21:14, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
:::I think the new wording is excellent. During the FAC a number of people tried to figure out a way to describe the Singapore strategy in a single sentence, which the MOS requires. I think we have one now. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 21:28, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
::::Yes, it is an excellent lead sentence. I am very impressed; although I improved it, I knew it needed someone else to write it. -[[User:Fjozk|Fjozk]] ([[User talk:Fjozk|talk]]) 22:18, 2 November 2012 (UTC)

:Thanks for that! Added to the article. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 21:14, 31 May 2015 (UTC)

== POV ==
The article seems to put an anti-British POV similar to that put by Paul Keating. Some examples:
*The &quot;promised fleet&quot;. Was a fleet really promised? A plan is not a promise, and the pre-war plan was no longer feasible, if it ever had been.
*The tanks and plans sent to the USSR. Yes, but the USSR was under siege; Singapore wasn't. And how useful would tanks have been in Malaya?
*The focus on Australia, including the quote from Keating. In fact, Australia is mentioned 57 times; Malay only 16 times. WW2 was not all about Australia; the Battle of Singapore was not all about Australia.--[[User:Jack Upland|Jack Upland]] ([[User talk:Jack Upland|talk]]) 06:21, 25 July 2015 (UTC)

== On recent Origins edits ==
The sentence (and its context): &quot;Throughout the 1920s, the Royal Navy therefore remained the world's largest navy, with a comfortable margin of superiority over Japan, which was regarded as the most likely adversary.&quot; My issues: Does the given reference (which I cannot check) back up the first clause or the second or both? Is not the &quot;therefore&quot; misplaced as the first clause does not follow from the previous sentence on the Washington Naval Treaty? Is the first clause even relevant to the article? Moreover, edit summaries on reversions saying arbitrarily &quot;this is correct&quot; are not very helpful..without a lot more explaining. [[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 01:27, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
:I don't feel any particular need to be helpful. If you haven't done the reading, why are you trying to change the article? How can you know that what you say is covered by the text? When you make a change to an article like that, you are claiming expertise in the subject area. I have deleted &quot;therefore&quot;, as, while true and supported by the source, it doesn't logically follow from the previous sentence. Anyhow, the source talks about the Washington Naval treaty; the need to maintain superiority to the USN in American waters; discussions about how superior to the USN the RN needed to be; the &quot;Admiralty's growing concern about the perceived threat from Japan&quot; ... &quot;the navy's warnings about Japan's long-range intentions&quot;; Foreign Office arguments that Japan was not a threat.

::Do not worry, hawkeye, your edit descriptions and talk page comments would only rarely be (mis)taken as helpful. [[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 23:05, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
::Wait a second, [[User:Hawkeye7]]...&quot;therefore&quot; (an adverb or sentence connector) is &quot;true and supported by the source&quot; but &quot;it doesn't logically follow from the previous sentence&quot;? I am beginning to suspect you are the non-native English speaker. Or perhaps you have a peculiar notion of rhetoric and/or logic, i.e., whatever rationale necessary to convince yourself you are right? No need to respond. I understand.
