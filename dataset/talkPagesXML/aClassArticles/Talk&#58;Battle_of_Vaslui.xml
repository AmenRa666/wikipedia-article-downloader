==I don't understand this==
&quot;The battle lasted for four days where the fleeing Ottoman army was pursued by the Moldavian light cavalry and the 2,000-strong Polish cavalry for three days until they reached the town of Obluciţa (now Isaccea, Romania), in Dobruja.&quot; Is that seven days in all, or what? Can someone explain the sentence to me? [[User:Metamagician3000|Metamagician3000]] 13:11, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
:Yes, I'm aware of that and I was intending to fix it. Iorga says 3 days; the doc says 4 days. I'll fix it l8r. --[[User:Anittas|Thus Spake Anittas]] 13:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
Map is wrong - in 1475 east from Moldavia was Lithuania, or Grand Duchy of Lithuania, not Poland and Tartars  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vygandas|Vygandas]] ([[User talk:Vygandas|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Vygandas|contribs]]) 18:06, 10 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==GA Sweeps Review: Pass==
As part of the [[WP:WGA|WikiProject Good Articles]], we're doing [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps|sweeps]] to go over all of the current GAs and see if they still meet the requirements of the [[WP:WIAGA|GA criteria]]. I'm specifically going over all of the &quot;Conflicts, battles and military exercises&quot; articles. I believe the article currently meets the criteria and should remain listed as a [[WP:GA|Good article]]. I made some minor corrections concerning spelling and sentence structure; please look them over to verify if I've made any mistakes or changed common spelling. One thing in the article that should be fixed is the use of the word &quot;latter&quot; which is used four or five times within a couple of sections. Just reword a few instances of it so the article flows better. If you have any questions, let me know on my talk page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I have edited the article history to reflect this review. Regards, --[[User:Nehrams2020|Nehrams2020]] 03:56, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
:I intend to start working on the article, again, in December. There are many things that need improvement. --[[User:Anittas|Thus Spake Anittas]] 16:58, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

==Neutrality of this is disputed==
This is supposed to be a battle between the Ottomans ruled then by II.Mehmed and Moldavians. The nonneutrality starts from the name; it is supposed to be a battle where one side is Ottomans and the name of the battle in Turkish is not given! Again when we look at the references, nearly all of them (except 4 lines of shambolic Ottoman/Turkish references) are in Romanian given under Romanian names, even though this article is in English. When it comes to references to Ottoman historians which is written in three lines the shambles start: Oruc Bey and Kemalpasazade are given in one line even though these are published in different volumes and names in Turkish; Tajul Tevarikh is written by Hoca Sadeddin Efendi but shown to be by a Sa'd al-Din?? and the names of these references are written in English translation first (while in contrast Romanian references are in Romanian). The name of the Ottoman commander is given as Hadan Suleyman Pasha which cannot be correct since there is no word (mispelled or not) as Hadan in Turkish; it should be Hadim Suleyman Pasha. Again the Ottoman army numbers are totally inflated. In the 15. century an Ottoman army under a sub-commander was never as big as 60,000-80,000. One can only attribute this to non-neutrality since it gives the Moldovian so-called victory a bit more ''glitter''.  The whole edifice of nonneutrality is topped up by the last quote from a very biased source: ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. The references again show how non-neutral this article is: no reference to it from the Turkish Wikipedia !!!!!

==Inconsistent==

Jan 10, 2010 a change was made to the graphic to show 80,000 Moldavian soldiers and 50,000 Moldavian casualties.  This contradicts the text.  Might the change to the graphic be mischievous?  It reverses the issue of who outnumbered whom, and who suffered more casualties. [[Special:Contributions/71.91.126.109|71.91.126.109]] ([[User talk:71.91.126.109|talk]]) 12:40, 10 January 2010 (UTC)

== The portrait does not belong to Suleiman ==

In the infobox  there is a portrait of Suleyman Pasha. A good portrait. But alas, it is false. The portrait belongs to [[Suleiman Pasha]] of [[Egypt]] who was actually a French named Joseph Anthelme Sève (1788-1860). The battle took place 313 years before he was born. The image must be delated. But before delating, I’ll try to reach the contributor. [[User:Nedim Ardoğa|Nedim Ardoğa]] ([[User talk:Nedim Ardoğa|talk]]) 07:05, 21 June 2010 (UTC)

== Ottoman General's name is wrong ==

the name of the II. Mehmet's general has been written ''Hadam(Hadım) suleyman pasha'' in the article. I have to say that it's not true. He was born on around 1470 and died in 1548. He cant rule a battle at 5 years old. Every source(even turkish) are wrong. Only [[tr: Hadım Süleyman Paşa]] is correct. If someone could translate from the original source to any languages i can relink them again. Now i unlink the articles about hadim suleiman pasha because of you are not talking about the same and correct general. [[User:Zulayhe|Zulayhe]] ([[User talk:Zulayhe|talk]]) 11:10, 6 May 2011 (UTC)

== &quot;Dracula&quot; ==
Any particular reason why this name is used? Dracula is a a creation of Bram Stoker, and while inspired by Vlad Dracul is just a fictional character. The real name of the prince is Vlad Dracul, also known as Vlad the Impaler. At least use Vlad Dracula, otherwise a reader might get the impression that armies of vampires supported Stephen... [[User:Roofred|Roofred]] ([[User talk:Roofred|talk]]) 11:08, 15 December 2011 (UTC)
 Vlad Dracul was Vlad Tepes father,not Vlad Tepes himserf.His father Vlad II Dracul,'Dracula' was Vlad III Tepest=The Impailer.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/89.122.32.90|89.122.32.90]] ([[User talk:89.122.32.90|talk]]) 11:34, 8 February 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
