'''SMS ''Habsburg''''' was the second and final member of the {{sclass-|Erzherzog Ferdinand Max|ironclad|4}} of [[broadside ironclad]]s built for the [[Austrian Navy]] in the 1860s. She was built by the [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]]; her [[keel]] was laid down in June 1863, she was launched in June 1865, and [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] in June 1866 at the outbreak of the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] and the [[Austro-Prussian War]], fought concurrently. The ship was armed with a main battery of sixteen 48-pounder guns, though the [[rifling|rifled]] guns originally intended, which had been ordered from Prussia, had to be replaced with old smoothbore guns until after the conflicts ended.

''Habsburg'' saw action at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] in July 1866, though she was not significantly engaged during the battle. In 1870, she was used in a [[show of force]] to try to prevent the Italian annexation of Rome while the city's protector, France, was distracted with the [[Franco-Prussian War]], though the Italians took the city regardless. The ship's armament was revised several times in the 1870s and 1880s, before she was ultimately withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a [[guard ship]] and a [[barracks ship]] in [[Pula|Pola]] in 1886. She served in this role until 1898 when she was stricken from the [[naval register]] and [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap in 1899&amp;ndash;1900.

==Description==
{{main|Erzherzog Ferdinand Max-class ironclad}}

''Habsburg'' was {{convert|83.75|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]]; she had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|15.96|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7.14|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|5130|MT|sp=us}}. She had a crew of 511. Her propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion [[steam engine]] that drove a single [[screw propeller]]. The number and type of her coal-fired boilers have not survived. Her engine produced a top speed of {{convert|12.54|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|2925|ihp|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=G268&gt;Gardiner, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

''Habsburg'' was a [[broadside ironclad]], and she was armed with a [[main battery]] of sixteen 48-pounder [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] [[smooth-bore]] guns. She also carried several smaller guns, including four 8-pounder guns and two 3-pounders. The ship's hull was sheathed with [[wrought iron]] armor that was {{convert|123|mm|abbr=on}} thick on the battery and reduced to {{convert|87|mm|abbr=on}} at the bow and stern.&lt;ref name=G268/&gt;

==Service history==
''Habsburg'' was built by the [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] shipyard in [[Trieste]]. Her [[keel]] was laid down in June 1863, and she was [[ship launching|launched]] on 24 June 1865. The builders were forced to complete [[fitting-out]] work quickly, as tensions with neighboring Prussia and Italy erupted into the concurrent [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] in June 1866. ''Habsburg''{{'}}s rifled heavy guns were still on order from [[Krupp]], and they could not be delivered due to the conflict with Prussia. Instead, the ship was armed with old smooth-bore guns.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 266, 268&lt;/ref&gt; Rear Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]], the commander of the Austrian Fleet, immediately began to mobilize his fleet. As the ships became fully manned, they began to conduct training exercises in [[Fasana]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June, Tegetthoff sortied with the Austrian fleet and steamed to [[Ancona]] in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral [[Carlo Pellion di Persano]], refused to engage Tegetthoff.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 216&amp;ndash;218&lt;/ref&gt; Tegetthoff made another sortie on 6 July, but again could not bring the Italian fleet to battle.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Lissa===
[[File:Battle of Lissa - 1866 - Initial Situation.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing the disposition of the fleets on 20 July]]
{{main|Battle of Lissa (1866)}}

On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet, with twelve ironclads, out of Ancona, bound for the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], where they arrived on the 18th. With them, they brought troop transports carrying 3,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name=S1&gt;Sondhaus, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Persano then spent the next two days bombarding the Austrian defenses of the island and unsuccessfully attempting to force a landing.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 221&amp;ndash;224&lt;/ref&gt; Tegetthoff received a series of telegrams between the 17 and 19 July notifying him of the Italian attack, which he initially believed to be a feint to draw the Austrian fleet away from its main base at [[Pula|Pola]] and [[Venice]]. By the morning of the 19th, however, he was convinced that Lissa was in fact the Italian objective, and so he requested permission to attack.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 229&amp;ndash;230&lt;/ref&gt; As Tegetthoff's fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, Persano's fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt. The latter's ships were divided into three groups, with only the first two able to concentrate in time to meet the Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 223&amp;ndash;225&lt;/ref&gt; Tegetthoff had arranged his ironclad ships into a wedge-shaped formation, with ''Habsburg'' on the right flank; the wooden warships of the second and third divisions followed behind in the same formation.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 230&amp;ndash;231&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was forming up his ships, Persano transferred from his [[flagship]], {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}}, to the [[turret ship]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}. This created a gap in the Italian [[line of battle|line]], and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a melee. He made a pass through the gap, but failed to ram any of the Italian ships, forcing him to turn around and make another attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 232&amp;ndash;235&lt;/ref&gt; ''Habsburg'' was not as heavily engaged in the ensuing melee; she did not attempt to ram any Italian vessels, instead employed converging fire, though without success.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the leading Italian ironclads, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Principe di Carignano||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Castelfidardo||2}}, opened fire at long range on ''Habsburg'', {{SMS|Kaiser Max|1862|2}}, and {{SMS|Salamander||2}}, though they only inflicted splinter damage on ''Salamander''.&lt;ref&gt;Clowes, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle ended after Tegetthoff's flagship, {{SMS|Erzherzog Ferdinand Max|1865|2}}, rammed and sank ''Re d'Italia'' and heavy Austrian fire destroyed the [[coastal defense ship]] {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Palestro||2}} with a [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance so as not to risk his success.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 238&amp;ndash;241, 250&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the battle, ''Habsburg'' had fired 170 shells and had been hit 38 times in response, though she was not damaged and sustained no casualties. The Austrian fleet proceeded to Lissa and anchored in the harbor in Saint George Bay. That evening, ''Habsburg'', {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1862|2}}, and a pair of [[gunboat]]s patrolled outside the harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Clowes, pp. 366&amp;ndash;368&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
After returning to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet in the northern Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the [[Armistice of Cormons]]; this ended the fighting and led to the [[Treaty of Vienna (1866)|Treaty of Vienna]]. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]], the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the [[Battle of Königgrätz]]. As a result of Austria's defeat, [[Kaiser Franz Joseph]] was forced to accede to Hungarian demands for greater autonomy, and the country became [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|''Ausgleich'']] of 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, pp. 1&amp;ndash;3&lt;/ref&gt; The two halves of the [[Dual Monarchy]] held veto power over the other, and Hungarian disinterest in naval expansion led to severely reduced budgets for the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate aftermath of the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, Kaiser Franz Joseph took a tour of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in his imperial [[yacht]] {{SMS|Greif|1866|2}}; ''Habsburg'', ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'', and a pair of [[paddle steamer]]s escorted the Kaiser for the trip to [[Port Said]] at the mouth of the [[Suez Canal]]. The two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean while the other vessels passed through the Canal into the [[Red Sea]] in company with [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugenie]] of France aboard her own yacht. The Austro-Hungarian ships eventually returned to Trieste in December.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, ''Habsburg'' was the sole Austro-Hungarian ironclad in active service, the rest having been disarmed and laid up in Pola. Following the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] that summer and the withdrawal of the French garrison from [[Rome]], the Italy seemed likely to annex the city from the [[Papal States]]. Franz Joseph decided to attempt to deter an Italian attack on Rome, and since ''Habsburg'' was the only [[capital ship]] available, she was sent to several Italian ports as a show of force in August. She left Italian waters in September at the same time the Prussians decisively defeated the French at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]]. With the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]], and Franz Joseph unwilling to unilaterally attack Italy to defend Rome, the Austro-Hungarians backed down and Italy seized the city.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 ''Habsburg'' was rearmed with a battery of fourteen {{convert|7|in|abbr=on|0}} muzzle-loading [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] guns and four light guns. Her battery was revised again in 1882, with the addition of four {{convert|9|cm|abbr=on}} [[breech-loading]] guns, two {{convert|7|cm|abbr=on}} breech-loaders, a pair of {{convert|47|mm|abbr=on}} [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing]] revolver guns, and three {{convert|25|mm|abbr=on}} auto-cannon. ''Habsburg'' was withdrawn from service in 1886 and thereafter served as a [[guard ship]] and [[barracks ship]] in Pola. That year, these were removed and a single {{convert|26|cm|abbr=on|1}} gun and a {{convert|24|cm|abbr=on}} gun were installed. She was stricken from the [[naval register]] on 22 October 1898 and [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap in 1899&amp;ndash;1900.&lt;ref name=G268/&gt;
