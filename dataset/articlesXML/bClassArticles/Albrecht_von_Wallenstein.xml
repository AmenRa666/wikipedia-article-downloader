Dissatisfied with the Emperor's treatment of him, Wallenstein considered allying with the Protestants. However, he was assassinated at [[Cheb|Eger/Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] by one of the army's officials, Walter Devereux, with the emperor's approval.

== Early life ==
[[File:Isabelle von Harrach.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Isabelle von Harrach, Wallenstein's second wife]] 
Wallenstein was born on 24 September 1583 in [[Heřmanice (Náchod District)|Heřmanice]], [[Bohemia]], which is the westernmost and largest region  in the present-day [[Czech Republic]], into a poor [[Protestantism|Protestant]] branch of the [[Waldstein family|Waldstein (Wallenstein, Valdštejn) family]] who owned Heřmanice castle and seven surrounding villages.&lt;ref name=Schiller-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wallenstein. Biografie eines Machtmenschen|first=Robert|last=Rebitsch|publisher=Böhlau|location=Wien|year=2010|isbn=3205785835|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Margaretha (Markéta) (née Smiřická of Smiřice) died in 1593, his father Wilhelm (Vilém) in 1595.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wallenstein. Biografie eines Machtmenschen|first=Robert|last=Rebitsch|publisher=Böhlau|location=Wien|year=2010|isbn=3205785835|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had raised him bilingually – the father spoke German while his mother preferred Czech – yet Wallenstein in his childhood had a better command of [[Czech language|Czech]] than of [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name=Rebitsch23&gt;{{cite book|title=Wallenstein. Biografie eines Machtmenschen|first=Robert|last=Rebitsch|publisher=Böhlau|location=Wien|year=2010|isbn=3205785835|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious affiliation of both his parents was [[Lutheranism]] and [[Utraquism]].&lt;ref name=Rebitsch23/&gt;

After their deaths, Albrecht for two years lived with his maternal uncle Heinrich (Jindřich) Slavata of Chlum and Košumberk, a member of the [[Unity of the Brethren]] (Bohemian Brethren), and adopted his uncle's religious affiliation.&lt;ref name=Rebitsch23/&gt; His uncle sent him to the brethren's school at [[Luže (Chrudim District)#Ko.C5.A1umberk castle|Košumberk Castle]] in Eastern Bohemia. In 1597, Albrecht was sent to the Protestant Latin school at [[Złotoryja|Goldberg]] (now Złotoryja) in [[Silesia]], where the then-German environment led him to hone his German language skills.&lt;ref name=Rebitsch23/&gt; While German became Wallenstein's everyday language, he is said to have continued to curse in Czech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wallenstein|first1=Golo|last1=Mann|first2=Ruedi|last2=Bliggenstorfer|publisher=Fischer|year=1973|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 August 1599, Wallenstein continued his education at the Protestant [[University of Altdorf]] near [[Nuremberg]], [[Franconia]], where he was often engaged in brawls and épée fights, leading to his imprisonment in town prison.&lt;ref name=Rebitsch23/&gt;

In February 1600,&lt;ref name=Rebitsch23/&gt; Albrecht left [[Altdorf bei Nürnberg|Altdorf]] and travelled around the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Early modern France|France]] and [[History of Italy (1559–1814)|Italy]],&lt;ref name=Rebitsch24&gt;{{cite book|title=Wallenstein. Biografie eines Machtmenschen|first=Robert|last=Rebitsch|publisher=Böhlau|location=Wien|year=2010|isbn=3205785835|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied at the universities of [[University of Bologna|Bologna]] and [[University of Padua|Padua]].&lt;ref name=Ripley&gt;Ripley, George &amp; Charles Anderson Dana. (1858) ''The New American Cyclopaedia'', D. Appleton and Company. pp. 185-189.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Wallenstein was fluent in German, Czech, [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], was able to understand [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and spoke some [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name=Rebitsch23/&gt;

Wallenstein then joined the army of the Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] in [[Royal Hungary|Hungary]], where, under the command of [[Giorgio Basta]], he saw two years of armed service (1604–1606) against the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Ottoman Turks]] and [[Stephen Bocskay|Hungarian]] rebels.&lt;ref name=Ripley /&gt; In 1604, his sister Kateřina Anna married the leader of the Moravian Protestants, Karel the Older [[House of Zierotin|of Zierotin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/bohemia/zierotin1.html#P3 |title= bohemia/zierotin1.html#P3 |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}} {{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/waldstein/waldstein4.html#KAN |title= waldstein/waldstein4.html#KAN |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied at the [[University of Olomouc]] ([[Graduation|Graduated]] 1606). His contact with the Olomouc [[Jesuit order|Jesuits]] was partly responsible for his conversion to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] in the same year.&lt;ref name=Rebitsch24/&gt; The contributory factor to his conversion may have been the [[Counter-Reformation]] policy of the [[Habsburg]]s that effectively barred Protestants from being appointed to higher offices at court in Bohemia and in Moravia, and the impressions he gathered in Catholic Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wallenstein. Biografie eines Machtmenschen|first=Robert|last=Rebitsch|publisher=Böhlau|location=Wien|year=2010|isbn=3205785835|pages=24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no sources clearly indicating the reasons for Wallenstein's conversion, except for a subjunctive anecdote by his contemporary [[Franz Christoph von Khevenhüller]] about the Virgin Mary saving Wallenstein's life when he fell from a window in [[Innsbruck]].&lt;ref name=Rebitsch24/&gt; Wallenstein was later made a member of the [[List of Knights of the Golden Fleece|Order of the Golden Fleece]].

In 1607, based on recommendations by his brother-in-law, Zierotin, and another relative, [[Adam of Waldstein]], often mistakenly referred to as his uncle, Wallenstein was made [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] at the court of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]], and later also chamberlain to archdukes Ferdinand and Maximilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wallenstein. Biografie eines Machtmenschen|first=Robert|last=Rebitsch|publisher=Böhlau|location=Wien|year=2010|isbn=3205785835|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609, Wallenstein married Czech Lucretia of Víckov, née Nekšová, of Landek,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/634857/Albrecht-von-Wallenstein Encyclopaedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; rich widow of [[Arkleb of Víckov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bilder des Weiblichen in Erzähltexten über den Dreissigjährigen Krieg|first=Waltraud|last=Maierhofer|publisher=Böhlau|location=Köln Weimar|year=2005|isbn=3412104051|pages=39, 418}}&lt;/ref&gt; who owned the towns of [[Vsetín]], [[Lukov (Zlín District)|Lukov]], [[Rymice]] and Všetuly/[[Holešov]] (all in eastern Moravia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wallenstein.

In 1623, Wallenstein married Isabella Katharina, daughter of Count [[Harrach]]. She bore him two children, a son who died in infancy and a surviving daughter.&lt;ref name=Ripley /&gt; Examples of the couple's correspondence survive. The two marriages made him one of the wealthiest men in the [[Crown of Bohemia|Bohemian Crown]].

== Thirty Years' War ==
[[Image:Valdstejnsky Palace garden autumn.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Wallenstein Palace]] in Prague]]
The [[Thirty Years' War]] began in 1618 when the [[The Estates|estates]] of Bohemia rebelled against Ferdinand of Styria and elected [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], the leader of the [[Protestant Union]], as their new king. Wallenstein associated himself with the cause of the [[Catholics]] and the [[Habsburg dynasty]].  Sympathizing with the Bohemians, he used his position as commander of the troops of the Moravian estates to escape with the Moravian treasure-chest to [[Vienna]].  There, however, the authorities told him that the money would go back to the Moravians — but he had shown his loyalty to Ferdinand, the future Emperor.

Wallenstein equipped a regiment of [[cuirassier]]s and won great distinction under [[Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy]] in the wars against [[Ernst von Mansfeld]] and [[Gabriel Bethlen]] (both supporters of the Bohemian revolt) in [[Moravia]]. Wallenstein recovered his lands (which the rebels had seized in 1619) and after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (8 November 1620) he secured the estates belonging to his mother's family and confiscated tracts of Protestant lands. He grouped his new possessions into a territory called [[Frýdlant v Čechach|Friedland (Frýdlant)]] in northern Bohemia.  A series of successes in battle led to Wallenstein becoming in 1622 an imperial [[count palatine]], in 1623 a prince, and in 1625 [[Duke]] of [[Duchy of Friedland|Friedland]].&lt;ref name=Schiller&gt;Schiller, J. Friedrich Von. (1980) ''Robbers'' and ''Wallenstein'', Penguin Classics, pp. 12–3. ISBN 0-14-044368-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallenstein proved an able administrator of the duchy&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Wallenstein | first = Golo | last = Mann}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also sent a large representation to Prague to emphasize his nobility.

In order to aid Ferdinand (elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1619) against the Northern Protestants and to produce a balance in the Army of the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] under [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]], Wallenstein offered to raise a whole army for the imperial service following the ''[[bellum se ipsum alet]]'' principle, and received his final commission on 25 July 1625. Wallenstein’s success as a military commander brought him fiscal credit, which in turn enabled him to receive loans to buy lands, many of them being the former estates of conquered Bohemian nobles. Wallenstein also used his credit to grant loans to Ferdinand II, who then repaid him through lands and titles.&lt;ref&gt;JP Cooper, “The New Cambridge Modern History” The Thirty Years’ War 1st ed. (New York, New York: Cambridge University Press. 1970), 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallenstein's popularity soon recruited 30,000 (not long afterwards 50,000) men.&lt;ref name=Eggenberger&gt;Eggenberger, David. (1985) ''An Encyclopedia of Battles'', Courier Dover Publications. p. 161. ISBN 0-486-24913-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The two armies worked together over 1625–27, at first against Mansfeld.

Having beaten Mansfeld at [[Battle of Dessau Bridge|Dessau]] (25 April 1626), Wallenstein cleared [[Silesia]] of the remnants of Mansfeld's army in 1627.&lt;ref name=Eggenberger /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fuller&gt;Fuller, J. F. C. (1987) ''A Military History of the Western World'', Da Capo Press. p. 46-47. ISBN 0-306-80305-4.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he bought from the emperor the [[Duchy of Sagan]] (in Silesia). He then joined Tilly in the struggle with [[Christian IV of Denmark]],&lt;ref&gt;Spielvogel, Jackson J. (2005) ''Western Civilization'', Thomson Wadsworth, p. 414. ISBN 0-534-64604-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards gained as a reward the Duchies of [[Mecklenburg]], whose hereditary dukes suffered expulsion for having helped the [[Denmark|Danish]] king. This awarding of a major territory to someone of the lower nobility shocked the high-born rulers of many other [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]].&lt;ref name= Wedgwood&gt;[[C.V. Wedgwood|Wedgwood, C.V.]] (1961) ''The Thirty Years War'', Anchor Books, pp. 219–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallenstein assumed the title of &quot;[[Admiral]] of the [[North Sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea]]s&quot;. However, in 1628 he failed to capture [[Stralsund]], which resisted the [[Capitulation of Franzburg]] and the [[Battle of Stralsund (1628)|subsequent siege]] with assistance of Danish, Scottish and [[Sweden|Swedish]] troops, a blow that denied him access to the Baltic and the chance of challenging the naval power of the [[Scandinavia]]n kingdoms and of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=Fuller /&gt; Though he succeeded in defeating [[Christian IV of Denmark]] in the [[Battle of Wolgast]] and neutralizing [[Denmark]] in the subsequent [[Peace of Lübeck]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Denmark, 1513–1660: the rise and decline of a Renaissance monarchy|first=Paul Douglas |last=Lockhart|publisher=[[Oxford University]] Press|year=2007|isbn=0-19-927121-6|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=TkteH2TrSSsC&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=2009-08-07 |pages=166–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; the situation further deteriorated when the presence of the Imperial catholic troops on the Baltic and the Emperor's &quot;[[Edict of Restitution]]&quot; brought King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] into the conflict.&lt;ref name= Fuller /&gt; He attempted to aid forces of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] under [[Hetman]] [[Stanisław Koniecpolski]], which were [[Polish-Swedish War|fighting Sweden]] in 1629; however, Wallenstein failed to engage any major Swedish forces and this significantly affected the outcome of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlquist, Germund Wilhelm &amp; Carl Von Clausewitz. (2003) ''Principles of War'', Courier Dover Publications, p. 81. ISBN 0-486-42799-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dankaerts-Historis-9254.tif|thumb|Engraving of Albrecht von Wallenstein]]Over the course of the war Wallenstein's ambitions and the exactions of his army had made him a host of enemies, both [[Catholic]] and Protestant princes and non-princes. Ferdinand suspected Wallenstein of planning a coup to take control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Emperor's advisors advocated dismissing him, and in September 1630 envoys were sent to Wallenstein to announce his removal.&lt;ref name = Schiller /&gt; Wallenstein gave over his army to General Tilly, and retired to [[Jičín]], the capital of his Duchy of Friedland. There he lived in an atmosphere of &quot;mysterious magnificence&quot;.&lt;ref name= Ingrao&gt;Ingrao, Charles W. (2000) ''The Habsburg Monarchy, 1618–1815'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 45–6.  ISBN 0-521-78505-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, circumstances forced Ferdinand to call Wallenstein into the field again.&lt;ref name=Schiller /&gt; The successes of Gustavus Adolphus over General Tilly at the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|Battle of Breitenfeld]] and on the [[Lech river|Lech]] (1632), where Tilly was killed, and his advance to [[Munich]] and occupation of Bohemia, demanded action.&lt;ref name= Ingrao /&gt; In the spring of 1632, Wallenstein raised a fresh army within a few weeks and took to the field. He drove the Saxon army from Bohemia and then advanced against Gustavus Adolphus, whom he opposed near [[Nuremberg]] and after the [[Battle of the Alte Veste]] dislodged. In November, came the great [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]], in which Wallenstein was forced to retreat but in the confused melee, Gustavus Adolphus was killed. Wallenstein then withdrew to winter quarters in Bohemia.&lt;ref name=Ingrao /&gt;

In the campaigning of 1633, Wallenstein's apparent unwillingness to attack the enemy caused much concern in Vienna and in Spain.  At this time the dimensions of the war grew more European. Wallenstein had, in fact, started preparing to desert the Emperor: he expressed anger at Ferdinand's refusal to revoke the [[Edict of Restitution]]. Historic records tell little about his secret negotiations; but rumors told that he was preparing to force a ''just peace'' on the Emperor ''in the interests of united [[Germany]]'', at the same time hesitating — as he used to do in other respects — and trying to stay loyal to the Emperor as far as possible. With this apparent &quot;plan&quot; he  entered into negotiations with [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], and [[France]]. But, apparently, the Habsburgs' enemies tried to draw him to their side.  In any case, he gained little support.  Anxious to make his power felt, he at last resumed the offensive against the Swedes and Saxons, winning his last victory at [[Ścinawa|Steinau]] on the [[Oder]] in October. He then resumed negotiations.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|page=281}}

== Assassination ==
[[Image:Ermordung-wallensteins-in-eger-anonymer-kupferstich 1-640x370.jpg|thumb|300px|The Killing of Wallenstein in [[Cheb|Eger/Cheb]].]]
In December Wallenstein retired with his army to Bohemia, around Pilsen (now [[Plzeň]]). Vienna soon definitely convinced itself of his treachery, a [[secret court]] found him guilty, and the Emperor looked seriously for a means of getting rid of him (a successor in command, the later emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]], was already waiting). Wallenstein was aware of the plan to replace him, but felt confident that when the army came to decide between him and the Emperor the decision would be in his favour.&lt;ref name=Ingrao /&gt;

On 24 January 1634 the Emperor signed a secret patent (shown only to certain officers of Wallenstein's army) removing him from his command. Finally an open [[Letters patent|patent]] charging Wallenstein with [[high treason]] was signed on 18 February and published in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name=Schiller /&gt; In the patent, Ferdinand II ordered to have Wallenstein brought under arrest to Vienna, dead or alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lunde|first1=Henrik|title=A Warrior Dynasty|date=2014|publisher=Casemate|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losing the support of his army, Wallenstein now realized the extent of his peril, and on 23 February with a company of some hundred men, he went from Plzeň to [[Cheb|Eger/Cheb]], hoping to meet the Swedes under [[Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar|Duke Bernhard]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|page=282}} After his arrival at Cheb, however, certain senior Scottish and Irish officers in his force assassinated him on the night of February 25.&lt;ref name=Ingrao /&gt; To carry out the assassination, a regiment of dragoons under the command of an Irish Colonel Walter Butler&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfbd/0365.html Projekt Runeberg: Walter Butler]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scots colonels [[Walter Leslie (1607-1667)|Walter Leslie]] and John Gordon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; first fell upon Wallenstein's trusted officers [[:de:Adam Erdmann Trčka von Lípa|Adam Trczka]], [[Vilém Kinský|Vilém Kinsky]], Christian Illov and Henry Neumann whilst the latter banqueted at Cheb Castle (which had come under the command of John Gordon himself), and massacred them. Trczka alone managed to fight his way out into the courtyard, only to be shot down by a group of musketeers.&lt;ref name=Wedgwood /&gt; A few hours later, an Irish captain, Walter Devereux, together with a few companions, broke into the burgomaster's house at the main square where Wallenstein had his lodgings (again courtesy of John Gordon), and kicked open the bedroom door. Devereux then ran his [[halberd]] through the unarmed Wallenstein, who, roused from sleep, is said to have asked in vain for [[No quarter|quarter]].

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] may not have commanded the murder, nor even desired it, but he had given free rein to the party who he knew wished &quot;to bring in Wallenstein, alive or dead.&quot; After the assassination, he rewarded the murderers with honour and riches.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of World History, Sixth edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallenstein was buried at [[Jičín]].  In 1785, his remains were moved to [[Mnichovo Hradiště]].

== Significance and legacy ==
The Czech National Museum produced a large exhibition about Wallenstein at the [[Wallenstein Palace]] in Prague (current seat of Senate) from 15 November 2007 till 15 February 2008. He is also the subject of Schiller's play trilogy ''[[Wallenstein (play)|Wallenstein]]''. One of the episodes in [[Erich Kästner]]'s &quot;[[The 35th of May, or Conrad's Ride to the South Seas|The 35 May]]&quot; depicts Wallenstein in his afterlife being engaged in a fierce war with [[Hannibal]] and emphasizes both generals' callous disregard for the lives of their soldiers - underlining Kästner's [[pacifist]] views. Wallenstein is also a main figure in [[Alfred Döblin]]'s [[Wallenstein (novel)|eponymous novel]] from 1920.

Wallenstein's particular genius lay in recognizing a new way for funding war: instead of merely plundering enemies, he called for a new method of systematic &quot;war taxes&quot;. Even a city or a prince on the side of the Emperor had to pay taxes towards the war. He understood the enormous wastage of resources that resulted from tax exactions on princes and cities of defeated enemies only, and desired to replace this with a &quot;balanced&quot; system of taxation; wherein both sides bore the cost of a war. He was unable to fully realize this ambition; and in fact his idea led to the random exploitation of whole populations on either side, until finally, almost fifteen years after his death, the war had become so expensive that the warring parties were forced to make peace. In any case, Wallenstein's idea inspired many, among them, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]], to &quot;pluck the goose with a minimum of screeching&quot;.

Composer [[Bedřich Smetana]] honored Wallenstein in his 1859 symphonic poem ''[[Wallenstein's Camp]]'', which was originally intended as an overture to a play by [[Schiller]].&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to Deutsche Grammophon recording 437254-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallenstein has also been examined by economists, notably [[Arthur Salz]] in his book ''Wallenstein als Merkantalist'' (''Wallenstein as [[Mercantilist]]'').
