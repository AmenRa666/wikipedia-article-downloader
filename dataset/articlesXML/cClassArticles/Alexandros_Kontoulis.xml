'''Alexandros Kontoulis''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος Κοντούλης}}, 1858–1933) was a [[Greece|Greek]] Army officer who rose to the rank of [[Lieutenant General]]. He was among the driving minds behind the [[Macedonian Struggle]] and was involved in the [[Albanian National Awakening|Albanian national movement]], with the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' of '''Kapetan Skourtis''' (Καπετάν Σκούρτης). Kontoulis fought with distinction in the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]] and the [[First Balkan War]], where he was heavily wounded. In the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922]], he commanded the [[I Army Corps (Greece)|I Army Corps]] on the southern sector of the Greek front from February 1921 to June 1922. After his retirement, he served as ambassador to [[Albania]].

== Early life and career ==
Alexandros Kontoulis was born in [[Eleusis]] on {{OldStyleDate|10 January|1859|29 December 1858}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc190&quot;&gt;Sokos (1929), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; or {{OldStyleDate|22 April|1858|10 April}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;K17&quot;/&gt; His family were [[Arvanites]], attested in the region around Elefsina since the turn of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;K17&quot;&gt;Polychronopoulou-Klada (2000), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 20, he participated as a volunteer in the failed [[Epirus Revolt of 1878|uprising]] in [[Epirus]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Kontoulis and many of the Greek volunteers were arrested and sentenced to death by the Ottomans, but eventually pardoned at the intercession of the British government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc190&quot;/&gt; Released from Ottoman captivity, on 17 July 1880 he enlisted in the [[Greek Army]]. He entered the NCO School in 1833 and graduated on 22 September 1885 (O.S.) as a 2nd Lieutenant of the Infantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;K17&quot;/&gt; In 1886, he fought in the clashes between Greek and Ottoman troops on their frontier in [[Thessaly]]. After that, he was included in the Austrian military geographical training mission that was sent to Greece to help found the Greek Amy's [[Hellenic Military Geographical Service|geographical service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc190&quot;/&gt; Promoted to Lieutenant on 26 May 1895 (O.S.),&lt;ref name=&quot;K17&quot;/&gt; during the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]], Kontoulis distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Velestino]], where his commanding officer, Colonel [[Konstantinos Smolenskis]], requested his promotion and the award of the [[Order of the Redeemer]] for exceptional bravery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc190&quot;/&gt;

== Macedonian Struggle and Albania ==
Kontoulis was promoted to Captain on 24 March 1899 (O.S.).&lt;ref name=&quot;K17&quot;/&gt; At the same time, along with [[Pavlos Melas]], he became a leading member in the secret nationalistic society, the ''[[Ethniki Etaireia]]'', and after the society's dissolution in 1900, in the aftermath of the defeat of the 1897 war, he served for ten years as the chairman of the [[Panhellenic Shooting Society]], which largely succeeded the former in its activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;K17&quot;/&gt; Due to his own Arvanite origin and association with the Greek nationalistic circles of Athens, Kontoulis was deeply interested in the rising [[Albanian National Awakening|Albanian nationalism and quest for independence]], and maintained contacts with the Albanian leader [[Ismail Qemali]].&lt;ref&gt;Polychronopoulou-Klada (2000), pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1903, however, his contacts with Melas and [[Ion Dragoumis]] led him to focus on the [[Macedonian Question]]. After contacts with the bishop of [[Kastoria]], [[Germanos Karavangelis]], Kontoulis became an ardent supporter of sending of armed bands to Ottoman-ruled [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to counter the pro-Bulgarian &quot;armed propaganda&quot; of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). At the same time, he took over as foster father the care of several children of pro-Greek fighters in Macedonia, including the sons of [[Konstantinos Christou]] (''Kapetan Kottas''),&lt;ref&gt;Polychronopoulou-Klada (2000), pp. 29–31&lt;/ref&gt; whose biography he later wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/metadata/3/8/a/metadata-avrbnllj0bkb7vjhuv1sonhjf5_1311325176.tkl | title = Βιογραφία Καπετάν Κώττα | last = Kontoulis | first = Alexandros | publisher = Τυπογραφείον Σ. Μ. Κωνσταντινίδου | location = Florina | language = Greek | year = 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Melas and Captains [[Anastasios Papoulas]] and [[Georgios Kolokotronis]], Kontoulis (with the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' of '''Kapetan Skourtis''') was one of the four officers sent by the Greek government in early March 1904 to reconnoitre the situation in Macedonia and lay the groundwork for the subsequent &quot;[[Macedonian Struggle]]&quot; by Greek armed bands against their Bulgarian rivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polychronopoulou-Klada (2000), pp. 31ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to Greece, he was promoted to Major on 15 October 1908 (O.S.) and Lt. Colonel on 6 July 1911 (O.S.).&lt;ref name=&quot;K17&quot;/&gt; During this time, Kontoulis kept up his contacts with Ismail Qemali, acting as his intermediary with the Greek government. When the [[Albanian Revolt of 1911|Albanian rebellion]] at [[Malësia]] broke out in 1911, Kontoulis, once again under his old ''nom-de-guerre'' of ''Skourtis'', went to [[Scodra]] and the [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegrin]] capital [[Cetinje]], urging the Christians of the region to defect from the Ottoman army and likewise press for concessions to the religious and national minorities from the Ottoman government. Qemali also signed to a proposal by Kontoulis and Dragoumis for an &quot;Eastern Federation&quot; of the nations of the Ottoman Balkans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polychronopoulou-Klada (2000), pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balkan Wars and Asia Minor ==
During the subsequent [[Balkan Wars]], Kontoulis commanded an independent [[Evzone]] detachment in the [[Army of Epirus]]. He distinguished himself during the bloody battle for Aetorrachi heights, when he continued fighting despite being wounded. During the offensive against the [[Bizani]] fortress on 3 December 1912, however, he was heavily wounded and hospitalized. After convalescing, he was appointed military governor of [[Korytsa]] in [[Northern Epirus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc190&quot;/&gt; He was promoted to full Colonel on 21 May 1913 (O.S.).&lt;ref name=&quot;K17&quot;/&gt;

During [[World War I]] and the [[National Schism]], Kontoulis remained loyal to King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], and fought in the ''[[Noemvriana]]'' against the French.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} He was promoted to Major General on 21 May 1917 (O.S.).&lt;ref name=&quot;K17&quot;/&gt; After the ousting of Constantine in June 1917, like many royalist soldiers, Kontoulis was sidelined, and returned to active service only after the royalist [[Greek legislative election, 1920|electoral victory]] in November 1920 against [[Eleftherios Venizelos]].

By that time, Greece was embroiled in the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922]] against [[Kemal Atatürk]]'s [[Ankara]]-based Turkish nationalist movement. In early 1921, Kontoulis replaced the Venizelist general [[Konstantinos Nider]] in command of [[I Army Corps (Greece)|I Army Corps]]. During the March 1921 offensive, he was successful in breaking through the Turkish lines at [[Dumlupınar, Kütahya|Dumlupınar]] and capturing [[Afyonkarahisar]]. The defeat of [[III Army Corps (Greece)|III Army Corps]] in the northern sector of the offensive ([[First Battle of İnönü]]) forced him to withdraw back to the Dumlupınar lines. There he repulsed repeated Turkish assaults on 26–29 March (O.S.).&lt;ref&gt;Sokos (1929), pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Kontoulis led the I Corps again with success during the [[Battle of Afyonkarahisar-Eskişehir|Greek summer offensive]], during the subsequent march through the salt desert around [[Lake Tuz]] towards Ankara, and in the decisive [[Battle of the Sakarya]] and the subsequent Greek retreat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc191&quot;&gt;Sokos (1929), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; He was named Lt. General on 6 October 1921 (O.S.), and in May 1922, he was replaced as commander by Lt. General [[Nikolaos Trikoupis]], returning to Greece, where he went into retirement on 24 April 1923 (O.S.).&lt;ref name=&quot;K17&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc191&quot;/&gt;

== Retirement, ambassador to Albania and death ==
Unlike many military officers, Kontoulis refused to be drawn into the political turmoil that engulfed the country following the [[Battle of Dumlupınar|disastrous defeat]] of the Greek Army by the Turks in August 1922. After his retirement, he was offered the position of ambassador to [[Albania]], a position which he initially declined but eventually accepted in 1925 and held until 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc191&quot;/&gt; During his retirement he lived in [[Piraeus]], he put together a considerable personal archive, and was engaged a chairman in the editorial committee that published the ''Great Military and Naval Encyclopedia'' in 1929–1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enc191&quot;/&gt; He died on 22 August 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Polychronopoulou-Klada (2000), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
