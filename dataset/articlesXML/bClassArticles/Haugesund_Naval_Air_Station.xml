'''Haugesund Naval Air Station''' ({{lang-no|Marinens flystasjon Haugesund}}) was a military [[water aerodrome]] situated at [[Avaldsnes]] in [[Karmøy]] in the outskirts of [[Haugesund]], [[Norway]]. The [[air base]] was operated by the [[Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service]] from 17 November 1918 to 7 April 1919. The airport consisted of three portable hangars, a barracks and an outhouse.

The station was established to allow two [[Sopwith Baby]]s to assist the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] in [[minesweeping]] around Karmøy. In this capacity they continued until 21 January 1919. The airport was subsequently reactivated on 5 February to aid in fisheries patrol. This duty lasted until 7 April.

==History==
The need for an airport in [[Haugaland]] for the Naval Air Service arose in 1918, during the late stages of the [[First World War]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] had mined the waters of the [[North Sea]] between the borders of the Norwegian [[territorial waters]] to [[Scotland]] in an effort to deter German [[U-boat]]s. The navy decided to establish the station in the bay at Avaldsnes. The airport's structures were built Norsk Barakke- og Imprigneringskompani and sent by railway from [[Hamar]] to [[Bergen]] and onwards to Karmøy by barge, arriving on 27 October 1918.&lt;ref name=hafstad&gt;{{cite book |last=Hafstad |first=Bjørn |last2=Arheim |first2=Tom |title=Marinens flygevåpen 1912–1944 |publisher=TankeStreken |year=2003 |isbn=82-993535-1-3 |language=Norwegian |page=40}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew was sent from [[Karljohansvern]] on 15 November 1918 and the command flag was hoisted on 17 November. The same day [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]] flew the first of two Sopwith Babys to the station. Seven people were stationed at Avaldsnes, under the command of First Lieutenant Riiser-Larsen. He was subordinate to the captain of [[HNoMS Tordenskjold|HNoMS ''Tordenskjold'']], which was stationed in Haugesund. The Spowiths were used in minesweeping duty. They would survey the North Sea for mines. In case they found any, they would note its location on a map and drop it to the crew on the nearest [[minesweeper]]. Work was carried out around Karmøy and the shipping channel towards [[Stavanger]]. By January it was decided that minesweeping in the area would no longer require aerial aid. The aircraft were flown to Kristiansand on 17 January 1919 and the station was closed on 21 January 1919.&lt;ref name=hafstad /&gt;

After a request from the fisheries organizations, the Navy Air Services agreed to assist in the search for herring. The station was reactivated on 5 February 1919 and two days later the two Sopwiths were attempted returned to Avaldsnes. However, both had motor issues during flight. Not until 13 February did the aircraft reach their destination. Fisheries patrol continued until 7 April. There were plans to return the following year, but this was not carried through. Instead the buildings were attempted sold to Bø Teglverk. When they were not able to pay, they were instead moved to Flatøy in 1922.&lt;ref name=hafstad /&gt;

==Facilities==
The airport was situated at Avaldsnes in Karmøy, in the outskirts of Haugesund. It was situated on the property of Bø Teglværk. The aerodrome consisted of three portable hangars, measuring {{convert|7.5|by|8.5|m|sp=us}} and {{convert|3.5|m|sp=us}} tall. It also featured a barracks and an outhouse.&lt;ref name=hafstad /&gt;
