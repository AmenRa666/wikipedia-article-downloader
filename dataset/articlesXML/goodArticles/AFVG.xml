The '''AFVG''' (standing for '''Anglo-French Variable Geometry''') was a [[supersonic]] multi-role combat aircraft with a [[variable-sweep wing|variable-geometry wing]],{{#tag:ref|The term in use at the time was variable-geometry.|group=N}} being jointly developed by [[British Aircraft Corporation]] in the United Kingdom and [[Dassault Aviation]] of France. The project was cancelled in June 1967, when the French Government withdrew from participation. BAC modified the specification to solely satisfy [[Royal Air Force]] needs, reconfiguring the design as the '''UKVG''' and sought out new partners to procure the aircraft, which ultimately emerged as the tri-national consortium-funded '''MRCA''' [[Panavia Tornado]], a variable-geometry wing fighter aircraft.

==Development==

===Background===
The AFVG project followed on from the earlier BAC P.45 design study{{#tag:ref|BAC ceased work on the P.45 and its follow-up P.61 project in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Willox 2002, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread198224/pg1 &quot;The Sepecat Jaguar and its roots.&quot;] ''Top Secret''. Retrieved: 4 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} for a variable-geometry strike/trainer/fighter aircraft for the Royal Air Force; one of a number of proposed designs{{#tag:ref|The BAC P.45/P.61 joined the Folland Fo.147, Hawker Siddeley P.1173, Hunting H.155 and Vickers 593 as contenders for the AST.362 advanced fighter/trainer requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, David. [http://www.targetlock.org.uk/jaguar/ &quot;SEPECAT Jaguar: Origins.&quot;] ''Target Lock,'' 2010. Retrieved: 13 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} to meet AST.362.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman 2007, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglo-French collaboration===
Discussions took place in 1964 between France and Great Britain on collaborative military aviation programs with Handel Davies, the co-chairman of an Anglo-French committee, and his French counterpart, Ingénieur-General Lecamus, negotiating the launch of two new military combat aircraft. The French would take the lead role in a light ground-attack/trainer, while the British assumed the leadership of a swing-wing multirole fighter project.&lt;ref name = 'guardian obit'/&gt;

On 17 May 1965, after the cancellation of the [[BAC TSR-2]], the British and French governments signed agreements for the two joint projects; one based on the [[Breguet Aviation]] Br.121 ECAT (&quot;Tactical Combat Support Trainer&quot;) proposal; this would later evolve, after the cancellation of AFVG, to become the [[SEPECAT Jaguar]]. The other was the AFVG, a larger, variable-geometry  [[aircraft carrier|carrier]]-capable fighter aircraft for the French Navy ([[French Naval Aviation|''Aéronavale'']]) as well as fulfilling interceptor, tactical strike and reconnaissance roles for the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;dual Role.&quot;&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%200114.html &quot;Anglo-French projects go ahead... The AFVG and its dual role.&quot;] ''Flight'' via ''flightglobal.com,'' 26 January 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design specifications===
In RAF service, the AFVG was originally intended as a fighter, replacing the [[English Electric Lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 1981, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the RAF's decision to procure the [[F-4 Phantom II]] instead, the AFVG's expected role changed in 1966 to supplementing the [[General Dynamics F-111K|F-111K]]{{#tag:ref|Another variable-geometry (VG) design from the US replacing the cancelled TSR-2.|group=N}} strike aircraft in replacing the [[English Electric Canberra]] and the [[V bomber]] force.&lt;ref name=&quot;flight1967b&quot;&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%200359.html &quot;AFVG Programme Details: Questions and some answers from the Commons debate on defence.&quot;] ''Flight'' via ''flightglobal.com,'' 9 March 1967. Retrieved: 29 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFVG was to be powered by two [[SNECMA]]/[[Bristol Siddeley]] M45G [[turbofan]]s, fed by Mirage-style half-[[shock cone]] inlets.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1994, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine development programme contract was to be issued by the French government to a SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley [[joint venture]] company registered in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;flight1967b&quot;/&gt;

===Cancellation===
For Marcel Dassault, the founder of the firm that bore his name, relinquishing leadership on a major project, essentially taking a subordinate position to BAC on the AFVG threatened his company's long-term objective of becoming a premier prime contractor for combat aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 2006. pp. 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt; After less than a year, Dassault began to actively undermine the AFVG project, working on two competing &quot;in-house&quot; projects: the variable-geometry [[Dassault Mirage G|Mirage G]] and the [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F1]].&lt;ref&gt;DeVore, Marc. [http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/3/1/1/3/1/pages311317/p311317-1.php &quot;Making Collaboration Work: Examining Sub-Optimal Performance and Collaborative Combat Aircraft.&quot;] ''allacademic.com.'' Retrieved: 2 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1967, the French government announced their withdrawal from the AFVG project ostensibly on grounds of cost.{{#tag:ref|Dassault gained valuable data on variable-geometry configurations and may have used the excuse of cost issues to divert funds to their own VG projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%200917.html &quot;Military and Research.&quot;] ''Flight'' via ''flightglobal.com,'' 1 June 1967. Retrieved: 29 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} The unilateral French decision led to a censure debate in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%201287.html &quot;Mr. Healey under Fire: The AFVG Censure debate.&quot;] ''Flight'' via ''flightglobal.com,'' 20 July 1967. Retrieved: 29 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967 when the French withdrew from the AFVG programme, the [[Air Ministry]] was faced with a dilemma stemming from the imminent prospect of cancelling the F-111K, a decision that was taken in November 1967, to be formalized on 20 March 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;torn birt 11&quot;&gt;Heron 2002, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redesign==
With the prospect of no operational aircraft available to fulfill the RAF's strike role, BAC revamped the AFVG design, eliminating the carrier capabilities that were no longer necessary, into a larger, more strike-oriented VG aircraft, renamed UKVG.&lt;ref name=&quot;torn birt 11&quot;/&gt; While funding for the UKVG in the United Kingdom was seriously restricted, the government sought partners in NATO{{#tag:ref| Belgium, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and West Germany were approached.&lt;ref name = 'guardian obit'&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/may/24/guardianobituaries.obituaries &quot;Obituary: Handel Davies.&quot;] ''The Guardian,'' 24 May 2003. Retrieved: 29 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} to create a common NATO strike aircraft. This eventually led to the [[Panavia Tornado|Multi-Role Combat Aircraft]] (MRCA) project, later to become the Panavia Tornado.&lt;ref name = 'guardian obit'/&gt;
