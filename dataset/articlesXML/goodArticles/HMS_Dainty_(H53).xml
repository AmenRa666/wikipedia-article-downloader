'''HMS ''Dainty''''' was a [[C and D-class destroyer|D-class]] [[destroyer]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] before she was transferred to the [[China Station]] in early 1935. She was temporarily deployed in the [[Red Sea]] during late 1935 during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], before returning to her assigned station where she remained until mid-1939. ''Dainty'' was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before [[World War II]] began in September 1939. She briefly was assigned to West Africa for convoy escort duties in 1940 before returning to the Mediterranean. The ship participated in the [[Battle of Calabria]] in July 1940 and was assigned to convoy escort and patrol duties until she was sunk by German [[bomber]]s off [[Tobruk]] on 24 February 1941.

==Description==
''Dainty'' displaced {{convert|1375|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1890|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|329|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|36000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|36|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Dainty'' carried a maximum of {{convert|473|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|5870|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}. The ship's complement was 145 officers and men.&lt;ref name=w78&gt;Whitley, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship mounted four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|QF 4.7-inch Mark IX guns]] in single mounts. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Dainty'' had a single 12-pounder (3-inch (76.2&amp;nbsp;mm)) gun and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the [[Vickers .50 machine gun|QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III]] machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|21-inch torpedoes]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 215, 299&lt;/ref&gt; One [[depth charge]] rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
''Dainty'' was ordered on 2 February 1931 under the 1930 Naval Estimates and was laid down at the yards of the [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]], [[Govan]], [[Scotstoun]] on 20 April 1931. She was launched on 3 May 1932 and completed on 22 December 1932, at a total cost of £229,378, excluding equipment supplied by the [[Admiralty]], such as weapons, ammunition and wireless equipment.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was initially assigned to the [[1st Destroyer Flotilla]] in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Red Sea]] in October–November 1933. ''Dainty'' was refitted at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] between 3 September and 23 October 1934 for service on the China Station with the 8th (later the 21st) Destroyer [[Flotilla]] and arrived there on 3 January 1935. She was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in the [[Red Sea]] from 30 September 1935 to June 1936 during the Abyssinian Crisis. The ship was refitted afterwards in Hong Kong between 21 September and 15 October and conducted anti-piracy patrols after her refit was complete. On 21 January 1937, the merchant ship SS ''Hsin Pekin'' grounded on the Nemesis Rock off [[Ningbo]] and ''Dainty'' posted a guard aboard her until she was refloated. The ship made a number of port visits in [[Sarawak]], Singapore and the [[Philippines]] in January–March 1938. As war loomed, she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, arriving at [[Alexandria]] with her sister {{HMS|Duncan|D99|2}} on 30 September 1939, after the outbreak of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dainty'' was assigned to search for [[contraband]] being shipped across the Mediterranean throughout October and November, before undergoing a refit at [[Malta]] from 8–30 December. On its completion she was transferred to the 2nd Destroyer Division, based in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]] to search for German [[commerce raider]]s operating in the South Atlantic. The ship was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet in April and was given another refit at Malta from 21 April to 2 June 1940. On its completion, ''Dainty'' was assigned to the [[10th Destroyer Flotilla]].&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 52, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June, she rescued over 400 survivors from the [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Calypso|D61|2}}, which had been sunk off [[Crete]].&lt;ref name=e4&gt;English, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later, the ship, and three other destroyers, escorted the {{ship|French battleship|Lorraine}} and three British cruisers as they bombarded [[Bardia]] during the night of 20/21 June.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June, ''Dainty'', her sister {{HMS|Defender|H07|2}} and the destroyer {{HMS|Ilex|D61|2}} attacked the {{ship|Italian submarine|Console Generale Liuzzi}} and damaged her badly. The crew then [[Scuttling|scuttled]] ''Liuzzi''.&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 54, 57&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, ''Dainty'' and ''Ilex'' attacked the submarines {{ship|Italian submarine|Uebi Scebeli||2}} and {{ship|Italian submarine|Salpa||2}}, sinking ''Uebi Scebeli'', although ''Salpa'' was able to escape. The British ships were able to salvage important [[encryption]] material, including the latest [[codebook]]. They may also have been responsible for the sinking of the {{ship|Italian submarine|Argonauta}} on 29 June as she returned from [[Tobruk]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dainty'' participated in the Battle of Calabria on 9 July as an escort for the heavy ships of Force C and unsuccessfully engaged Italian destroyers and suffered no damage. Together with her sisters ''Defender'' and {{HMS|Diamond|H22|2}}, the Australian destroyer {{HMAS|Stuart|D00|2}}, and the light cruisers {{HMS|Capetown|D88|2}} and {{HMS|Liverpool|C11|2}}, she escorted Convoy AN.2 from [[Egypt]] to various ports in the [[Aegean Sea]] in late July. On 29 August ''Dainty'', ''Diamond'' and the destroyers {{HMS|Jervis|F00|2}}, {{HMS|Juno|F46|2}} escorted the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] [[tanker (ship)|tanker]] [[RFA Plumleaf|''Plumleaf'']] and two merchant ships, {{SS|Cornwall||6}} and {{SS|Volo||6}}, from [[Egypt]] to Malta with relief supplies. ''Dainty'' and ''Ilex'' escorted the Australian light cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|D48|2}} as she bombarded the Italian airfield on [[Scarpanto]] on 4 September.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, pp. 32, 34, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with three Australian destroyers and two British anti-aircraft cruisers, the ship escorted a convoy from Egypt to [[Suda Bay]], [[Crete]] and then to Malta in early November.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In December she was assigned to intercept enemy supply convoys along the North African coast and captured two [[schooner]]s off [[Bardia]] on 31 December.&lt;ref name=e4/&gt; In early January 1941, ''Dainty'' escorted the [[capital ship]]s of Force A during [[Operation Excess]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowher, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; She towed the disabled tanker ''Desmoulea'' to Suda Bay after the latter had been torpedoed by the {{ship|Italian torpedo boat|Lupo}} off Crete on 31 January.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinking===
Shortly afterwards, ''Dainty'' returned to patrol the North African coast. In the late afternoon of 24 February she left Tobruk on a patrol, accompanied by the destroyer {{HMS|Hasty|H24|2}}.&lt;ref name=e4/&gt; The ships were attacked by 13 [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers of III./[[Lehrgeschwader 1|''Lehrgeschwader'']] 1 and ''Dainty'' was hit by a {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bomb which passed through the captain's cabin and detonated in the fuel tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Taghon, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; This started a big fire, which caused her after [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] to explode and the ship to sink. 16 of ''Dainty''{{'}}s crew were killed in the attack and 18 were wounded.&lt;ref name=e4/&gt;
