The '''Battle of Vigo Bay''', also known as the '''Battle of Rande''' ({{Lang-gl|A Batalla de Rande}}; {{Lang-es|Batalla de Rande}}) was a naval engagement fought on 23 October 1702 during the opening years of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. The engagement followed an Anglo-Dutch [[Battle of Cádiz (1702)|attempt to capture]] the Spanish port of [[Cádiz]] in September in an effort to secure a naval base in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. From this station the Allies had hoped to conduct operations in the western [[Mediterranean Sea]], particularly against the French at [[Toulon]]. The amphibious assault, however, had proved a disaster, but as Admiral [[George Rooke]] retreated home in early October, he received news that the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] from [[Spanish Empire|America]], laden with silver and merchandise, had entered [[Vigo]] Bay in northern Spain. [[Philips van Almonde]] convinced Rooke to attack the treasure ships, despite the lateness of the year and the fact that the vessels were protected by French ships-of-the-line. 

The engagement was an overwhelming naval success for the Allies: the entire French escort fleet, under the command of [[François Louis de Rousselet, Marquis de Châteaurenault|Château-Renault]], together with the Spanish [[galleon]]s and transports under [[Manuel de Velasco y Tejada|Manuel de Velasco]], had either been captured or destroyed. Yet because most of the treasure had been off-loaded before the attack, capturing the bulk of the silver cargo had eluded Rooke. Nevertheless, the victory was a welcome boost to Allied morale and had helped persuade the Portuguese King, [[Peter II of Portugal|Peter II]], to abandon his earlier treaty with the French, and join the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]].

==Background==
{{See also|Battle of Cádiz (1702)}}
The accession of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] to the Spanish throne in 1700 had aroused little opposition in Spain. In the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish American empire]], however, officials and colonists resisted French attempts to take over their trade. Dutch and English traders – though officially illegal – were accepted by the Spanish, but in the [[Caribbean]], French admirals who had come to &quot;protect&quot; Spanish silver home to Europe were regarded with intense suspicion.&lt;ref name=roger165&gt;Roger: ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815,'' p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The first French squadron sailed in April 1701 under the [[Alain Emmanuel de Coëtlogon|Marquis de Coëtlogon]], but the Spanish governors would not even permit him to buy victuals, and he returned empty handed.&lt;ref name=roger165/&gt; Nevertheless, the weakness of the Spanish navy left the government in [[Madrid]] little choice but to rely on French warships for escort duty. Every effort was made to ensure that the bullion was landed in Spain rather than France, from where it might never return.&lt;ref name=roger165/&gt; 

The naval campaign of 1702 was therefore played out in two distant theatres of America and Spain, linked together by the trail of the Spanish treasure ships across the Atlantic. The American theatre became a scene long remembered in popular English tradition following Admiral [[John Benbow|Benbow]]'s [[Action of August 1702|running battle]] in August off [[Santa Marta]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim,'' p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Royal Navy]]'s main effort was not off the [[Spanish Main]], but off the Spanish coasts in Europe.&lt;ref name=trevelyan259&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim,'' p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of King [[William III of England|William III]], the Maritime Powers – England and the Dutch Republic – had resolved upon a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] strategy for the Allied fleets, a policy continued under William's successors following his death in March 1702. It was hoped that this strategy would encourage Portugal to join the Allies, open the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], and secure English naval power in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=trevelyan259/&gt; Their allies, the Austrians, were also clamouring for a naval presence in the Mediterranean to assist them in achieving their own primary ambitions – the capture of Spain's provinces in Italy. To meet these ends, the Anglo-Dutch fleets would first need to seize a port in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from which their ships could operate. The Allies, therefore, resolved upon an expedition, led by Admiral [[George Rooke]], [[Battle of Cádiz (1702)|to capture]] the southern Spanish port of [[Cádiz]], and at a stroke cut off Spain's transatlantic trade.&lt;ref name=roger165/&gt;

==Prelude==

===Silver fleet from America===
[[File:The Spanish Main.PNG|thumb|250px|The Spanish Main.]]

On 11 June 1702, the Spanish silver fleet from [[New Spain]] left [[Veracruz, Veracruz|
Veracruz]] under escort of a French squadron commanded by Admiral [[François Louis de Rousselet, Marquis de Châteaurenault|Château-Renault]]. The Spanish vessels were commanded by [[Manuel de Velasco y Tejada|Manuel de Velasco]] in his armed galleon, the ''Capitana de Barlovento'', one of three ships forming the ''Armada de Barlovento'' whose task it was to protect the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Armada de Barlovento'' was originally a defence squadron based in the Caribbean.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole convoy arrived at [[Havana]] on 7 July, before striking out across the Atlantic on the 24th.&lt;ref name=kamen166&gt;Kamen: ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research: The Destruction of the Spanish Silver Fleet at Vigo in 1702,'' p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet comprised 56 vessels: 22 were Spanish, the rest French, including a large number of  merchantmen which, by the end of the voyage, had sailed for France as soon as their safety across the Atlantic had been assured.&lt;ref name=kamen166/&gt; 

When Château-Renault had set out for the Caribbean in 1701, war between France and the Maritime Powers had not yet been declared; but the convoy had since received news of the outbreak of hostilities and of Rooke's blockade of Cádiz, the usual destination of the silver fleet from America.&lt;ref name=kamen166/&gt; It was clear, therefore, a new harbour would be needed. Valesco considered the small port of [[Pasaia|Los Pasajes]], but Château-Renault favoured [[Brest, France|Brest]] or [[La Rochelle]], or even [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name=kamen166/&gt; A compromise was put forward, and on 23 September the Franco-Spanish fleet entered [[Vigo]] Bay in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. There was, however, considerable delay in unloading the cargo. The whole administrative apparatus normally present at unloading (inspectors, valuers, royal officials, etc.), was in Seville and Cádiz, and had to be awaited before anything could be put ashore. When the unloading eventually began, it was found that means of transporting the goods were lacking. As a result, priority was given to the silver, which was unloaded first and despatched inland to [[Lugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamen: ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research: The Destruction of the Spanish Silver Fleet at Vigo in 1702,'' p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Rooke.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Admiral George Rooke (1650–1709) by [[Michael Dahl]].]]

===Allied pursuit===
By mid-October the English government had learnt of the Spanish presence in Vigo Bay, and immediately sent off messengers to scour the seas for Rooke and Admiral [[Cloudesley Shovell]], the latter of whom had been cruising with his squadron off [[Ushant]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Fevre &amp; Harding: ''Precursors of Nelson: British Admirals of the Eighteenth Century,'' p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; By now Rooke was returning home from the disastrous campaign against Cádiz, which, due to ill-discipline and poor co-operation, had forced the admiral to abandon the enterprise at the end of September. Fortuitously, however, Rooke had already learnt the news of the Spanish convoy from one of his own ships – Captain Thomas Hardy in the ''Pembroke'' who had stayed behind to water in the Portuguese port of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]]. ''Pembroke's'' chaplain, a Jersey man named Beauvoir, had learned from the boastful French consul of the treasure ships in the harbour, news of which had been confirmed to Beauvoir by a messenger from the Imperial Embassy in Lisbon. At once, Hardy gave chase, and caught Rooke on 17 October in time to prevent him crossing the [[Bay of Biscay]].&lt;ref name=trevelyan268&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim,'' p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral Rooke recorded in his journal:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;Under consideration of the intelligence brought to Captain Hardy of the ''Pembroke'' … It is resolved that we make best our way to the port of Vigo, and insult them immediately with our whole line, if not by such detachments as shall render the attempt most effectual.&lt;ref name=symcox226&gt;Symcox: ''War, Diplomacy, and Imperialism: 1618–1763,'' p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rooke sent ships to explore the mouth of Vigo Bay. A landing party had gleaned information from a captured friar that King Philip's part of the treasure had already been landed, but that much wealth was still left on board the Spanish vessels.&lt;ref name=trevelyan268/&gt;

==Battle==
[[File:Battle of Vigo Bay 1702.PNG|thumb|300px|Battle of Vigo Bay 1702. The walled town of Vigo sits about halfway down the bay.]]

On the evening of 22 October the Anglo-Dutch fleet entered the [[Ria de Vigo]], and sailed past the two forts of the city of Vigo that fired at them as they passed by. At the end of the bay the French fleet and Spanish treasure ships lay in the harbour of [[Redondela]], surrounded by the Galician mountains. Château-Renault had taken charge of the defensive measures, and had blocked the narrow entrance, across the Rande Strait, with a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom]] made largely of timber and chain tightly bound together.&lt;ref name=trevelyan268/&gt; At the north end of the boom was positioned a gun battery which, according to Rooke's journal, comprised &quot;fifteen or sixteen&quot; guns; at the south end sat Fort Rande sitting a little way up from the sea, consisting of a strong stone tower with platforms constructed for cannon. The space between the tower and the water's edge consisted of a fortified enclosure, at the bottom of which stood a battery commanding the straits. In total, the Rande fortifications had been armed with more than 30 guns. To supplement the French troops from the fleet, a number of levies were raised by the [[House of Arenberg|Prince of Barbançon]], governor and captain-general of Galicia.&lt;ref name=kamen166/&gt;

Aboard the [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1701)|''Royal Sovereign'']] an Allied council of war discussed the options for the attack. The plan was to destroy the boom with English and Dutch ships, whilst the troops from the fleet would silence the shore defences. But the naval encounter would not be a conventional line-of-battle engagement: Vigo Bay allowed no room for the deployment of a battle line, so Rooke had to adapt his tactics to the exigencies of the situation.&lt;ref name=symcox226/&gt; Rooke recorded in his journal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Upon consideration of the present position of Monsieur Château-Renault's squadron … and in regard the whole fleet cannot, without great hazard of being in a huddle, attempt them where they are: it is resolved to send in a detachment of fifteen English and ten Dutch ships of the line of battle with all the fireships, to use their best endeavours to take or destroy the aforesaid ships of the enemy …&lt;ref&gt;Symcox: ''War, Diplomacy, and Imperialism: 1618–1763,'' p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Breaking the boom===
[[File:Battle of Vigo bay october 23 1702.jpg|thumb|300px|The Battle of Vigo Bay. ''Anonymous'']]

Early in the morning on 23 October, Vice Admiral [[Thomas Hopsonn]] in the {{HMS|Torbay|1693|2}} led the attack on the boom, closely followed by a strong squadron of his English ships, and of Dutch vessels under Vice Admiral Van der Goes.&lt;ref name=trevelyan270&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim,'' p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Near each end of the boom Château-Renault had moored two of his largest men-of-war: the ''Bourbon'', and the ''Esperance''. Within the boom he had moored five other large men-of-war with their broadsides bearing upon the entrance. 

Meanwhile, Ormonde with some 2,000 men, had landed on the shore near Teis and marched on Fort Rande. Ormonde sent Lord Shannon with the vanguard of grenadiers to assault the position, defended by several hundred troops. The wall enclosing the outer ward was stormed, and the seaward battery silenced in time to assist the breaking of the boom by the ships. The tower, defended by approximately 300 Franco-Spanish troops, held out a little longer, but this also fell to the Allied grenadiers. As the southern shore guns were being assailed by Ormonde's men, the 90 gun ''Association'' attacked and silenced the smaller northern battery on the other side of the bay.&lt;ref name=trevelyan270/&gt; 

The ''Torbay'', favoured by a breath of wind, crashed at the boom; it cracked, and the ship floated through in amongst the French squadron beyond. However, a sudden drop in the breeze prevented any other Allied vessel following, and Hopsonn found himself temporarily outnumbered. A [[Fire ship|fireship]] was laid alongside the ''Torbay'', setting it alight. Fortunately for Hopsonn the fireship, laden with snuff from the Spanish Indies, suddenly blew up, and a great cloud enveloped the English vessel, partly extinguishing the flames thus enabling the crew to control the blaze.&lt;ref name=trevelyan271&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim,'' p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rooke's journal 53 men were drowned in the incident, but as the breeze picked up the other Allied ships managed to traverse the boom and engage with the enemy. 

With the boom broken, and the forts silenced, the Franco-Spanish fleet was lost. Offering little resistance, Château-Renault's men set fire to their own ships in the harbour, and sought safety on shore. The Allied seamen worked throughout the night to save their prizes, and by morning there was not a single French or Spanish vessel that had not been either captured or destroyed.&lt;ref name=trevelyan271/&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Losses and Gains===
Vigo Bay was a major naval disaster for the French:&lt;ref&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV: 1667–1714,'' p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; of the 15 ships of the line, 2 frigates and one fireship, not a single vessel escaped.&lt;ref name=kamen168&gt;Kamen: ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research: The Destruction of the Spanish Silver Fleet at Vigo in 1702,'' p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Five ships were captured by the English, and one by the Dutch; the rest were burnt, either by the Allies or the French themselves. (''See table below''). The Spanish suffered as badly: of the three galleons and 13 trading vessels in their fleet, all were destroyed, save five which were taken by the Allies (at least three of these were captured by the English). By 24 October most of the damage was complete; what remained of the ships and the fortifications were destroyed by Admiral Shovell's squadron on 27 October.&lt;ref name=kamen168/&gt; 

Spanish naval losses meant a total dependence on the French navy to keep up communications with the Americas.&lt;ref name=roger166&gt;Roger: ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815,'' p.166&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Spanish government felt no financial blow: it owned only two of the three large galleons, and none of the trading vessels. Those who suffered most, not just from the losses of the ships but also from the immense merchandise on board (pepper, cochineal, cocoa, snuff, indigo, hides, etc.) were the private traders. The news that the treasure fleet had got safely to Vigo was initially the cause of celebration for the merchants of [[Holland#Holland's prominence in the United Provinces and Dutch Republic|Holland]] but the subsequent reports of the battle were received with mixed feelings in [[Amsterdam]] as the wealth captured or destroyed belonged as much to the English and Dutch traders as it did to the  Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim,'' p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; What the Spanish government did own was the silver, most of which had already been unloaded from the ships  before the Allied attack, and was ultimately deposited in the castle of [[Segovia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamen: ''Philip V of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice,'' p. 32. The silver was placed in charge of Juan de Larrea, a leading member of the Council of the Indies.&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies, therefore, did not capture as much silver for themselves as was often supposed. The [[Master of the Mint]], [[Isaac Newton]], stated in June 1703 that the total metal handed in to him by that date was 4504&amp;nbsp;lb 2 oz of silver (~2,043&amp;nbsp;kg), and 7&amp;nbsp;lb 8 oz and 13 dwt of gold (~3.4&amp;nbsp;kg), estimated at a value of just £14,000.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen: ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research: The Destruction of the Spanish Silver Fleet at Vigo in 1702,'' p. 171. Coins subsequently struck from these metals bore the word ''VIGO'' below Anne's bust, and are rare and valuable.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1703, Philip V issued a decree, by way of reprisal, to confiscate all the silver that had come with the treasure fleet belonging to the English and Dutch, totalling four million [[peso]]s. In addition, the King decided to borrow two million pesos from what had come for the Spanish traders and the Consulate of Seville. In total, Philip managed to keep nearly seven million pesos, representing over half the silver from the fleet, amounting to the biggest sum in history obtained from the American trade by any Spanish king.&lt;ref name=kamen32&gt;Kamen: ''Philip V of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice,'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The result was an immense financial windfall for Philip V.&lt;ref name=kamen32/&gt;

===Methuen Treaties===
The naval success at Vigo had considerable implications for the Grand Alliance. On the accession of the Bourbon Philip V to the Spanish throne, King [[Peter II of Portugal|Peter II]] of Portugal, anxious to remain friends with his more powerful neighbour, had signed an alliance with France in June 1701. But it was the security of Portugal's overseas empire that was more important than its inland frontier.&lt;ref name=roger167&gt;Roger: ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815,'' p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; To protect Portugal's trade routes from South America, the ministers in Lisbon knew the importance of aligning themselves with the dominant naval power in the Atlantic. After Rooke's success at Vigo, it was clear that that naval strength reposed in the Maritime Powers.&lt;ref name=roger167/&gt;

In May 1703, the Portuguese signed the [[Methuen Treaty|Methuen Treaties]] with England. &quot;The preservation of our overseas colonies makes it indispensable for us to have a good intelligence with the powers which now possess the command of the sea,&quot; commented José da Cunha Brochado, the Portuguese minister in London, &quot;the cost is heavy, but for us such an understanding is essential.&quot;&lt;ref name=roger167/&gt; It was an Allied triumph to detach Portugal from her French alliance: with Lisbon as a base the Allied fleet could dominate the Strait of Gibraltar and cripple French action in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf: ''The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685–1715,'' p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; But the alliance with Portugal forced a major change in Allied strategy: the Maritime Powers now found themselves committed to extensive campaigning in Spain, with one army based in Lisbon, another based to the east in Catalonia. The policy was ultimately to prove a heavy burden and the cause of a disastrous campaign in the peninsula, but in the long term, the commercial provisions of the treaties were to prove an essential component of Britain's wealth. The naval victory at Vigo, therefore, made an indirect but powerful contribution to Britain's 18th century prosperity.&lt;ref name=roger167/&gt;

===Sunken treasure===
On 10 August 1990 after being surveyed by sonar side scan on behalf of '5º Centenario' (Spanish Government 500th anniversary of America's discovery) remains of the wreckage 'Santo Cristo de Maracaibo' were found off the Cíes Islands by R.O.V submarine at 79 metres depth, Contractor: Hidrografic S.A., Tarragona, Surveyor and R.O.V. Pilot: Olaf Hingst, Vessel: 'Potela Seis', Vigo.{{cn|date=August 2014}}
