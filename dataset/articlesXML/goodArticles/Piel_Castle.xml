'''Piel Castle''', also known as '''Fouldry Castle''' or the '''Pile of Fouldray''', is a [[castle]] situated on the south-eastern point of [[Piel Island]], off the coast of the [[Furness]] Peninsula in north-west England. Built in the early-14th century by John Cockerham, the [[Abbot]] of neighbouring [[Furness Abbey]], it was intended to oversea the trade through the local harbour and to protect against Scottish raids. The castle was built using stones from the local beach, and featured a large [[keep]] with surrounding inner and outer [[Bailey (fortification)|baileys]]. It was used as a base by the [[Yorkist]] pretender [[Lambert Simnel]] in 1487, but by 1534 it had fallen into ruin and passed into the hands of the Crown. Sea erosion began to cause significant damage to the castle in the early 19th century. In the 1870s the castle's owner, the [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch|Duke of Buccleuch]], carried out extensive restoration work and erected [[outwork]]s to protect it against further damage from the sea. In 1920 the castle was given to the town of Barrow-in-Furness and is now in the care of [[English Heritage]].

==History==
Piel Castle was built on [[Piel Island]], overlooking the [[deep water port]] of Piel Harbour outside of Barrow Haven, now called [[Barrow-in-Furness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=240}}; {{harvnb|Wood|1992-93|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may have been an earlier 12th-century fortification on the island, possibly built by the local monks in the reign of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]], but this is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53321 | title='The Parish of Dalton', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 8 (1914), pp. 304–319 | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}; {{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|pp=185–186}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1009097 | title=List Entry Summary: Piel Castle | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The suggestion of a 12th-century fortification on the site comes from a reference in a 1404 inquiry, stating that the endowment of the abbey was dependent on maintaining a castle there.

[[File:Piel Island and Castle, Barrow-in-Furness.jpg|thumb|left|Piel Castle and the surrounding [[Piel Island|island]], showing the keep (lower right) and the inner and outer baileys]]
Architectural historian Anthony Emery argues that the castle was built in three phases, starting with the central keep, which he believes was intended as a largely unfortified summer residence for the Abbot.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=240}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/piel-castle/history-and-research/ | title=History and Research: Piel Castle | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increased threat from Scotland and the granting of the licence to crenellate, Emery suggests that the inner bailey wall was then constructed to better defend the keep, followed by the outer bailey wall in a final phase of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emery 1996 240&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1408, the Abbot John Bolton decided that the cost of maintaining the castle was excessive, and attempted to pull down the defences, but was prevented from doing so by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]; this was followed by a period of rebuilding around 1429.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1992-93|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=186}}; {{harvnb|Pettifer|2002|p=272}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1009097 | title=List Entry Summary: Piel Castle | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was used for smuggling by the Abbey, leading to complaints from merchants in English-controlled [[Calais]] that they were illegally trafficking wool, which in this period could only legally be sold through the French port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=3487 | title=Piel Island | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Borough of Barrow-in-Furness}}; {{harvnb|Rose|2008b|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1487 the [[Yorkist]] pretender [[Lambert Simnel]] landed on Piel Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=241}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/piel-castle/history-and-research/ | title=History and Research: Piel Castle | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sought help from potential local supporters and held court at the castle, before advancing inland and ultimately being defeated at the [[Battle of Stoke Field]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Emery 1996 241&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1534 the castle had fallen in ruin and was described in a report as &quot;sore decayed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1986|p=64}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53321 | title='The Parish of Dalton', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 8 (1914), pp. 304–319 | postscript =|| mode = cs2| accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1537, on the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the Abbey]], it became the property of the Crown, and after 1660, was given to the [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|Duke of Albermarle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1986|p=64}}; {{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=187}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/piel-castle/history-and-research/ | title=History and Research: Piel Castle | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 18th century, the island had become used as a base for [[maritime pilot]]s, and the castle passed into the possession of the [[Duke of Buccleuch|Dukes of Buccleuch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/piel-castle/history-and-research/ | title=History and Research: Piel Castle | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811, the poet [[William Wordsworth]] visited the area and wrote a poem entitled &quot;Peele Castle&quot; describing the site.&lt;ref name=Raymond2009P231&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2009|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|William Wordsworth's poem spelled Piel Castle as &quot;Peele Castle&quot;, leading to occasional confusion with [[Peel Castle]], located on the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref name=Raymond2009P231/&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The sea caused significant [[erosion]] during this period, and one side of the keep collapsed in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victoria County History&quot;/&gt; [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch|Walter Scott]], the Duke of Buccleuch, purchased the rest of the island and carried out an extensive and expensive restoration of the castle between 1877 and 1878, destroying most traces of the medieval occupation of the site in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1986|p=64}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=3487 | title=Piel Island | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Borough of Barrow-in-Furness}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration involved constructing outworks to prevent further sea erosion, replacing damage to the [[ashlar]] stone features of the castle and protecting the tops of the stone walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmanP66Dalton&quot;/&gt;

In 1919 [[John Montagu Douglas Scott, 7th Duke of Buccleuch|John Scott]] decided to sell the island and castle; the local mayor, Alfred Barrow, intervened and the following the year the Duke instead agreed to give the castle and island to the local authorities as a [[War memorial|memorial]] to those who had lost their life in [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=EHBarrow&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/piel-castle/history-and-research/ | title=History and Research: Piel Castle | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=3487 | title=Piel Island | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Borough of Barrow-in-Furness}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle passed into the care of central government in 1973, and is now controlled by [[English Heritage]], who operate the site as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref name=EHBarrow/&gt; An archaeological survey was commissioned by English Heritage in 1984, carried out by Rachel Newman of [[Lancaster University]]; the findings of the survey led to a program of restoration work, completed in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1992-93|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is protected by law as a [[grade I listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1009097 | title=List Entry Summary: Piel Castle | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Plan of Piel Castle.png|thumb|300px|Plan of Piel Castle; A - outer bailey; B - chapel; C - inner bailey; D - keep]]

The castle is built to an [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#13th–14th centuries|Edwardian]] [[Concentric castle|concentric design]], with a keep in the south-eastern corner, protected by an inner and outer bailey with stone [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain walls]] extending out to the north-west.&lt;ref name=NewmanP65Dalton&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1986|p=65}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53321 | title='The Parish of Dalton', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 8 (1914), pp. 304–319 | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle is built using stones from the local beach bonded with a liquid mortar, with the finer stonework, such as the doorways and windows, made from [[Old Red Sandstone|red ashlar sandstone]] imported from the mainland.&lt;ref name=NewmanP66Dalton&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1986|p=66}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53321 | title='The Parish of Dalton', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 8 (1914), pp. 304–319 | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the surrounding island has been eroded by the sea and some of the castle has been lost, with fallen stone fragments still visible on the beach below.&lt;ref name=NewmanP66Dalton/&gt;

The three-storey keep stands on a low mound of [[clay]], similar to that making up the base of the rest of the castle, and is {{convert|45|ft|adj=on}} high, {{convert|76|ft}} by {{convert|74|ft}} across, reinforced with protruding [[buttress]]es, and a tower on the south-eastern corner.&lt;ref name=NewmanP65Dalton/&gt; The original entrance would have been at ground level, but a [[gatehouse]], {{convert|25|ft}} by {{convert|16|ft}}, was then built along on the north side, raising this to the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1986|pp=65–66}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53321 | title='The Parish of Dalton', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 8 (1914), pp. 304–319 | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carved female figure can be seen above the entrance arch, which may have been a representation of [[Salome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Victoria County History&quot;/&gt; The keep had large windows on the first and second floors, although the lower level of these was later blocked up, and was unusually divided into three sections, creating a central hallway on each level.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1986|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern side of the keep has collapsed as a consequence of land erosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victoria County History&quot;/&gt; Anthony Emery argues that the term &quot;keep&quot; is inappropriate for the building, which should be seen more as a residential [[tower house]], similar to that at [[Langley Castle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Emery 1996 240&quot;/&gt;

The inner and outer bailey walls have also been damaged by sea erosion, but they originally formed concentric squares around the keep and were protected by ditches.&lt;ref name=NewmanP65Dalton/&gt; The outer bailey wall, {{convert|8|ft|adj=on}} thick in places, is no longer very substantial, but even when first built it may have been quite weak; it is protected by a [[moat]], up to {{convert|13|m}} wide and {{convert|3|m}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1986|p=66}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53321 | title='The Parish of Dalton', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 8 (1914), pp. 304–319 | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1009097 | title=List Entry Summary: Piel Castle | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the baileys are protected by towers; the outer bailey towers are each {{convert|15.5|ft|adj=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=NewmanP65Dalton/&gt; The inner bailey wall is {{convert|8|ft|adj=on}} thick, protected by a {{convert|25|ft|adj=on}} wide moat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53321 | title='The Parish of Dalton', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 8 (1914), pp. 304–319 | postscript =| | mode = cs2|accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}; {{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its towers were a later addition to the original design, and a gatehouse in the inner bailey wall was also built shortly after the construction of the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1986|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortifications would have been slightly old fashioned for the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emery 1996 241&quot;/&gt; The outer bailey holds a stone building called &quot;the chapel&quot;, {{convert|31|ft}} by {{convert|15|ft}} in size.&lt;ref name=NewmanP66Dalton/&gt; Its original use is unknown and it appears to have been built late in the castle's history, possibly after it became ruinous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1986|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local legends exist of a tunnel between the castle and Furness Abbey, allegedly used by the monks as escape route from the mainland. No such passageway exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|2008a|p=142}}; {{harvnb|Berry|2009|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
