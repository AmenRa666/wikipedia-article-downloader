The '''Bell  CH-146 Griffon''' is a multi-use utility [[helicopter]] of the [[Huey family]], designed by [[Bell Helicopter Textron]] as a variant for the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] of the [[Bell 412EP]]. The CH-146 is used in a wide variety of roles, including aerial firepower, reconnaissance, [[search and rescue]] and aero-mobility tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNDArmy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/land-terre/equipment-equipement/item-eng.asp?product=139 |title= The Canadian Army – Equipment – Griffon Helicopter (CH-146) |work= Department of National Defence |authorlink= |date=October 2006 |accessdate= 2008-02-24 }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a crew of three, can carry up to 10 troops and has a cruising speed of {{cvt|220|-|260|km/h|kn mph}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNDAirForce specs&quot;/&gt;

==Design and development==
The CH-146 is the Canadian military designation for the Bell 412CF, a modified Bell 412, ordered by Canada in 1992.&lt;ref name=Eden_Bell_412&gt;Eden, Paul, ed. &quot;Bell 212/412&quot;. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. London: Amber Books, 2004. ISBN 1-904687-84-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The CH-146 was built at [[Mirabel, Quebec]], at the Bell Canadian plant. They were delivered between 1995 and 1997 in one of two configurations, the Combat Support Squadron (CSS) version for search and rescue missions, and the Utility Tactical Transport Helicopter (UTTH), which carries a crew of three and an eight-man [[Section (military unit)|section]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DNDArmy&quot;/&gt;

[[File:CH-146 Griffon.jpg|thumb|left|CH-146 Griffon in SAR markings]]
The Griffon can be equipped with various specialized bolt-on mission kits, which can enhance the performance of the Griffon, from increasing range, improving protection against enemy fire, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNDArmy&quot;/&gt;

While the CH-146 can be equipped with a total of 13 seats in the cargo area in addition to the two in the front for the aircrew, weight restrictions usually result in a normal combat load of eight equipped troops or fewer depending on armament and fuel carried. The aircraft can also be configured for up to six stretchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNDArmy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DNDAirForce&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/v2/equip/ch146/index-eng.asp |title= Canada's Air Force – Aircraft – CH-146 Griffon – Technical Specifications |work= Department of National Defence |authorlink= |date=March 2007 |accessdate= 2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minor disassembly permits transport of the Griffon by [[C-130 Hercules|CC-130 Hercules]] or [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|CC-177 Globemaster III]] aircraft for long-distance deployment.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNDArmy&quot;/&gt;

==Operational history==

The Canadian Forces purchased 100 aircraft&lt;ref name=Eden_Bell_412/&gt; and received them in 1995–1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNDAirForce specs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DNDAirForce&quot; /&gt;  In 2005, nine CH-146s were sold to the [[Allied Wings]] consortium to be used as trainers at [[3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;17Wing&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/17wing/squadron/3cffts_e.asp |title= 17 WING – WINNIPEG : SQUADRONS |work= Air Force Public Affairs / Department of National Defence |date=December 2007 |accessdate= 2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The CH-146 Griffon have been deployed in various operations in Canada since their introduction in 1995. They have been deployed during the Operation Saguenay in 1996 and Operation Assistance in 1997. The CH-146 have also played a major role during the [[great ice storm of 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/v2/equip/ch146/index-eng.asp|title= CH-146 Griffon |work= [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|DND]] |authorlink= |year= 2010 |accessdate= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were deployed during the [[28th G8 summit]] and [[36th G8 summit]]. They were also deployed to secure the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] during the Operation Podium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/v2/cb-ca/nr-sp/index-eng.asp?id=10784 |title= Operation Podium Air Component delivers |last= [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|DND]] |year= 2010 |accessdate= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, four Griffons were deployed as part of Operation LENTUS 16-01, to provide emergency services for victims of the [[2016 Fort McMurray wildfire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/operations-canada-north-america/op-lentus.page |title= Operation LENTUS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haiti and Balkans===

The CH-146 have been deployed in [[Haiti]]. They were deployed during the Operation Standard and Operation Constable between 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/od-bdo/di-ri-eng.asp?intlopid=305&amp;cdnopid=374 |title= Operation STANDARD |work= [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|DND]] |authorlink= |year= 2010 |accessdate= 2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/od-bdo/di-ri-eng.asp?intlopid=309&amp;cdnopid=379 |title= Operation CONSTABLE |work= [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|DND]] |year= 2010 |accessdate= 2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were deployed more recently during the [[Operation Halo]] in 2004 and [[Operation Hestia]] in 2010.

The Griffon have been deployed in [[Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]] during the Operation Kinetic between 1999 and 2000 and Operation Paladum between 1998 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cefcom.forces.gc.ca/pa-ap/ops/kinetic-eng.asp|title= Operation KINETIC |work= [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|DND]] |year= 2010 |accessdate= 2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===

In 2007, the [[Canadian American Strategic Review]] suggested the Canadian Forces consider deploying Griffons to Afghanistan, because they were comparable to some helicopters deployed by the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref name=Canwest2007-08-30&gt;{{cite news

 |quote      = The Canadian American Strategic Review, a defence-oriented Internet site operated out of Simon Fraser University, points out that until July 2006 the U.S. Marines flew convoy escort duties from Kandahar airfield in Huey helicopters. Those choppers are similar to the Griffons but less powerful, the site adds. It also questioned why the marines can operate such choppers when the Canadian Forces considers the local conditions in Kandahar too extreme for the Griffons.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 2008, the Canadian Forces announced by a statement that 8 Griffons would be modified to act as armed escorts for [[CH-47 Chinook|CH-147 Chinook]] helicopters in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/11/26/griffon-chinook-afghanistan.html &quot;Canada to send Griffon attack helicopters to Afghanistan&quot;].

===Suitability for role===
The CH-146 was purchased by the CF to replace four existing helicopters, the [[OH-58 Kiowa|CH-136 Kiowa]] in the observation role, the [[UH-1N Twin Huey|CH-135 Twin Huey]] in the army tactical role, the [[UH-1 Iroquois|CH-118 Iroquois]] in the base rescue role and the heavy lift [[CH-47 Chinook|CH-147 Chinook]]. From the time of its purchase defence analysts have been critical of the aircraft pointing to its procurement as politically motivated and that the aircraft cannot adequately fill any of its intended roles. It has been termed &quot;a civilian designed and built aircraft, with only a coat of green paint.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobson2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://naval.review.cfps.dal.ca/archive/public/vol2num2art9.pdf |title= Plain Talk – Who Decides? |last= Hobson |first= Sharon |authorlink= |date=Summer 2006 |accessdate= 2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cook2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://members.shaw.ca/canadaunderattack/CanadaUnderAttack.pdf |title= Canada Under Attack |last= Cook |first= M. Paul |authorlink= |year= 2005 |accessdate= 2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2006 defence analyst Sharon Hobson said:
{{quote|text=The Griffon helicopter has become almost a laughing stock. It is underpowered for the transport role the army needs it to play, and it’s too big for a reconnaissance role. At a time when the Canadian Forces are thirsting for equipment, it’s telling that about 20 of the Griffons have been parked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobson2006&quot; /&gt; }}

The CH-146 was ruled out for the Afghan mission by General [[Rick Hillier]] when he was Chief of Defence Staff in 2008 due to being underpowered. It has also been criticised for being underpowered by Martin Shadwick, a defence analyst and professor at [[York University]]. Shadwick stated in July 2009:&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC07Jul09&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/07/07/f-griffon-helicopter-afghanistan.html |title= The CH-146 Griffon helicopter |publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |authorlink= |date=July 2009 |work=CBC News |accessdate= 2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Its engines are fine for most domestic requirements in Canada and a more moderate temperature, but [the Griffon] doesn't really have the horsepower to reach its full potential in a place like Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC07Jul09&quot; /&gt; }}

At the inquest into the death of Capt Ben Babington-Browne (killed on 6 July 2009 in the crash of aircraft #146434), Lt Cdr William Robley of the UK Defence Helicopter Flying School confirmed that operating the aircraft at that altitude, temperature and weight meant that it was not the correct helicopter for that mission.  When asked by the coroner: &quot;Had you been there, would it have been obvious to you of the risks attached to using the Griffon helicopter in these conditions?&quot; Lt Cdr Robley replied: &quot;Yes.&quot; When asked: &quot;Would you expect a competent pilot to have understood that this was not the correct helicopter for the mission?&quot;, Lt Cdr Robley replied: &quot;It depended on the pilot's training; unless they have been trained, they are on a voyage of discovery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tel27Aug14&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11057018/Afghan-crash-helicopter-unsuitable-inquest-hears.html |title= Afghan crash helicopter 'unsuitable' inquest hears: report |accessdate= 2014-08-27 |authorlink= |date=27 August 2014 |work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retired Lieutenant General Lou Cuppens defended the aircraft's performance:
{{quote|text=When the discussions took place about Afghanistan it was very quickly determined that when you do the weather analysis, that the aircraft could not carry the same combat load of troops that it could in Canada and land in a temperate climate. But all you do then is, you use more of them to do the same mission. Looking at operations that we've done elsewhere in the Middle East, with similar aircraft, they all have limitations of some sort and you work with the limitations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC07Jul09&quot; /&gt;}}

Defence Minister [[Peter MacKay]] also defended the aircraft:
{{quote|I believe the Griffon is a superior helicopter, well-maintained, it's a utility helicopter that serves our interests both in Afghanistan and for purposes here in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC07Jul09&quot; /&gt;}}

===Future===
The CH-146 Griffon is forecast to be retired in 2021. Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Inc. was awarded a C$640 million contract to overhaul and repair the CH-146 fleet until retirement in 2021. The contact includes options to extend the contract up to 2025 if necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIAC14Jan11&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.aiac.ca/uploadedFiles/News_and_Events/AIAC_News/AIAC%20PM%20Bell%20Helicopter_Jan%2014%202011.pdf |title= AIAC congratulates Bell Helicopter Textron on Government of Canada contract that supports Canadian forces and maintains jobs |work= Aerospace Industries Association of Canada |date= 14 January 2011 |accessdate= 30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DID17Jan11&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Canada-Awards-Maintenance-Contract-for-Bell-412EP-Helis-06735/ |title= Canada Awards Maintenance Contract for Bell 412EP Helis |work= Defense Industry Daily |authorlink= |date= 17 January 2011 |accessdate= 30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents and incidents==
&lt;!-- *In December 1996, Griffon 146421 operated by 444 Sqn crashed at night in the waters of Northern Quebec during a search and rescue mission.  All aircrew survived but all sustained severe injuries from smoke inhalation to frostbite that needed amputation and various fractures.  The aircraft was lost at sea and the crew was found 72 hours after the incident on land suffering from hypothermia.  Cause of the crash was pilot error.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Hide uncited entry --&gt;
*On 18 July 2002, #146420 operated by 444 Sqn crashed north of [[CFB Goose Bay]] while returning from a search and rescue mission that had been called off. Both pilots were killed on impact and the SAR Technician and Flight Engineer were both seriously injured. The cause of the crash was the loss of the aircraft tail rotor after a tail rotor blade failed from fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/dfs-dsv/nr-sp/index-eng.asp?id=10024 Aircraft Occurrence Summary]. Directorate of Flight Safety, Canadian Forces, 20 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 6 July 2009, #146434 crashed about 80 kilometres northeast of Kandahar city killed two Canadian soldiers, along with a Captain from the British [[Royal Engineers]]. Three other Canadians were hurt. The crash was reportedly an accident due to the pilot's loss of visual reference in recirculating dust and not due to enemy action,&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC07Jul09&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CP08Jul09&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/07/08/afghan-cda-helicopter-griffon-crash070809.html |title= Afghan dust could have contributed to chopper crash: report |author= [[Associated Press]] |authorlink= |date=July 2009 |work=CBC News |accessdate= 2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/dfs-dsv/nr-sp/index-eng.asp?id=9999 Aircraft Occurrence Summary].
