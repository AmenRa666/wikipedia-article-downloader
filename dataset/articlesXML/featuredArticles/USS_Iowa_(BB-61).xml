'''USS ''Iowa'' (BB-61)''' is the [[lead ship]] of [[Iowa-class battleship|her class]] of [[battleship]] and the fourth in the [[United States Navy]] to be named in honor of the state of [[Iowa]]. Owing to the cancellation of the {{sclass-|Montana|battleship|2}}s, ''Iowa'' is the last lead ship of any class of United States battleships and was the only ship of her class to have served in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II.

During World War II, she carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt across the Atlantic to [[Mers El Kébir]], Algeria, en route to a crucial 1943 meeting in Tehran with Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Britain and Josef Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union. She has a bathtub—an amenity installed for Roosevelt, along with an elevator to shuttle him between decks.&lt;ref name=&quot;photo&quot;&gt;''Iowa'' was not the first US battleship to have a bathtub, the 1912 joiner plans for the [[USS Texas (BB-35)|U.S.S. ''Texas'']] and [[USS New York (BB-34)|U.S.S. ''New York'']] indicate that bathtubs were in the Admiral's Bath, Captain's Bath, Chief of Staff's bath, Junior Officer's Bath, Warrant Officer's Bath, Wardroom Officer's Baths, and the Sick Bay Bath when those ships were constructed. [[commons:File:Captain's Bath.jpg|photo]] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HALF_DECK_FWD._-1.tif] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Forward_Gun_Deck_USS_Texas_(BB-35).JPG] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2nd_deck_join2.JPG] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Admiral's_Bath_USS_Texas_(BB-35).jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; When transferred to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] in 1944, ''Iowa'' shelled beachheads at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] in advance of Allied amphibious landings and screened [[aircraft carrier]]s operating in the [[Marshall Islands]]. She also served as the Third Fleet [[flagship]], flying [[William Halsey, Jr.|Adm. William F. Halsey]]'s flag at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay. During the [[Korean War]], ''Iowa'' was involved in raids on the [[North Korea]]n coast, after which she was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]], better known as the &quot;mothball fleet.&quot; She was reactivated in 1984 as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] plan and operated in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets to counter the recently expanded [[Soviet Navy]]. In April 1989, [[USS Iowa turret explosion|an explosion of undetermined origin]] wrecked her No. 2 gun turret, killing 47 sailors.

The ''Iowa'' was decommissioned for the last time in the year 1990, and was initially stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in 1995. She was reinstated from 1999 to 2006 to comply with federal laws that required retention and maintenance of two ''Iowa''-class battleships. In 2011 USS ''Iowa'' was donated to the [[Los Angeles]]–based non-profit Pacific Battleship Center and was permanently moved to Berth 87 at the [[Port of Los Angeles]] in 2012, where she was opened to the public as the [[USS Iowa Museum|USS ''Iowa'' Museum]].

==Construction==
{{Main article|Iowa-class battleship|Armament of the Iowa class battleship}}

USS ''Iowa'' was the lead ship of [[Iowa-class battleship|her class]] of &quot;[[fast battleship]]&quot; designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 August 1942 which [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] attended and was [[sponsor (military)|sponsored]] by native Iowan [[Ilo Wallace]] (wife of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]]), and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 22 February 1943 with Captain [[John L. McCrea]] in command.&lt;ref name=Iowa-DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Iowa | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/i/iowa-iii.html | accessdate =14 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first ship of her class of battleship to be commissioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order&quot;&gt;{{NVR url|id=BB61|title=''Iowa''}}. [[Naval Vessel Register]]. The Department of Defense. Retrieved on 6 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

USS ''Iowa''{{'}}s main battery consisted of nine [[16&quot;/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|{{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}/50 caliber Mark 7 guns]], which could fire {{convert|2700|lb|kg|abbr=on}} armor-piercing shells {{convert|20|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}. Her secondary battery consisted of twenty [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}/38 cal gun]]s in twin mounts, which could fire at targets up to {{convert|12|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain [[air superiority]] came a need to protect the growing fleet of Allied [[aircraft carrier]]s; to this end, ''Iowa'' was fitted with an array of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] to defend Allied carriers from enemy airstrikes.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Battleships I&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Johnston | first = Ian |author2=McAuley, Rob   | title =The Battleships | publisher=Channel 4 | year =2002 | location = London | page =120 | isbn = 0-7522-6188-6 | oclc = 59495980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II (1943–45)==

===Shakedown and service with the Atlantic Fleet===
On 24 February 1943, ''Iowa'' put to sea for a [[sea trial|shakedown]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and along the Atlantic coast. She got underway on 27 August for [[Argentia|Argentia, Newfoundland]], to counter the threat of the German battleship {{Ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} which was reportedly operating in Norwegian waters, before returning to the United States on 25 October for two weeks of maintenance at the Norfolk Navy Yard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussiowa.org/general/html/detail.htm |title=USS Iowa(BB-61) Detailed History |accessdate=9 August 2008 |work=USS Iowa Veterans Association |publisher=The Veteran's Association of the USS Iowa (BB-61) |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After refueling and gathering her escorts, ''Iowa'' carried President Roosevelt, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]], Chief of Staff [[William D. Leahy|Admiral William D. Leahy]], [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff of the Army]] [[General George C.

Porter|DD-579|2}} which was involved in several mishaps, the most serious of which involved a torpedo drill which went awry when a torpedo from ''William D. Porter'' discharged from its tube and headed toward ''Iowa.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa II&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonner |first=Kit |url=http://www.ussiowa.org/general/html/willie_d.htm |title=The Ill-Fated USS William D.

''Iowa'' was unhurt and trained her main guns on ''William D. Porter'', concerned that the smaller ship may have been involved in some sort of assassination plot.

''Iowa'' completed her presidential escort mission on 16 December by returning the President to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa II&quot;/&gt; Roosevelt addressed the crew of ''Iowa'' prior to leaving by stating, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;from all I have seen and all I have heard, the ''Iowa'' is a 'happy ship,' and having served with the Navy for many years, I know—and you know—what that means.&quot; He also touched on the progress made at the conference before concluding his address with &quot;...&amp;nbsp;good luck, and remember that I am with you in spirit, each and every one of you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roosevelt |first=Franklin D. |authorlink=Franklin D.

===Service with Battleship Division 7, Admiral Lee===
[[Image:USS Iowa (BB-61) Preps.jpg|thumb|right|''Iowa'' in the Pacific; {{USS|Indiana|BB-58|2}} can be seen in the distance]]

As [[flagship]] of [[Battleship Division 7]] (BatDiv 7), ''Iowa'' departed the United States on 2 January 1944 for the Pacific Ocean, transiting the [[Panama Canal]] on 7 January in advance of her combat debut in the campaign for the [[Marshall Islands]]. From 29 January to 3 February, she supported carrier air strikes made by Rear Admiral [[Frederick C. Sherman]]'s Task Group 38.3 (TG 38.3) against [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] atolls. Her next assignment was to support [[Operation Hailstone|air strikes]] against the major Japanese naval and logistics base at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], [[Caroline Islands]]. ''Iowa'', in company with other ships, was detached from the support group on 16 February 1944 to conduct an anti-shipping sweep around Truk, with the objective of destroying enemy naval vessels escaping to the north. On 21 February, she was underway with the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] (TF 58 or TF 38, depending on whether it was part of the [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th Fleet]] or [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]]) while it conducted the first strikes against [[Saipan]], [[Tinian]], [[Rota (island)|Rota]], and [[Guam]] in the [[Mariana Islands]]. During this action, ''Iowa'', along with her sister ''New Jersey'', sank the Japanese [[light cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Katori||2}}, the cruiser having escaped Truk the day before following [[Operation Hailstone]], the US air attack on Truk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

On 18 March 1944, ''Iowa'', flying the flag of Vice Admiral [[Willis A. Lee]] ([[List of major U.S. Commands of World War II|Commander Battleships, Pacific]]), joined in the bombardment of [[Mili Atoll]] in the Marshall Islands. Although struck by two Japanese {{convert|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} projectiles, ''Iowa'' suffered negligible damage. She then rejoined TF 58 on 30 March, and supported air strikes against the [[Palau Islands]] and [[Woleai]] of the Carolines for several days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt;

From 22–28 April, ''Iowa'' supported air raids on [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] (now known as Jayapura), [[Aitape]], and [[Wake Island]]s to support Army forces on Aitape and at [[Tanahmerah Bay|Tanahmerah]] and [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bays]] in [[New Guinea]]. She then joined the Task Force's second strike on [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], on 29 and 30 April, and bombarded Japanese facilities on [[Pohnpei|Ponape]] in the Carolines on 1 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt;

In the opening phases of the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]], ''Iowa'' protected the American carriers during air strikes on the islands of Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Rota, and [[Pagan Island]] on 12 June. ''Iowa'' was then detached to bombard enemy installations on Saipan and Tinian on 13–14 June, which resulted in the destruction of a Japanese ammunition dump. On 19 June, in an engagement known as the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], ''Iowa'', as part of the battle line of TF 58, helped repel four massive air raids launched by the Japanese Middle Fleet. This resulted in the almost complete destruction of Japanese carrier-based air-forces, with ''Iowa'' claiming the destruction of three enemy aircraft. ''Iowa'' then joined in the pursuit of the fleeing enemy fleet, shooting down one [[torpedo plane]] and assisting in splashing another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

Throughout July, ''Iowa'' remained off the Marianas supporting air strikes on the Palaus and landings on Guam. After a month's rest, ''Iowa'' sailed from Eniwetok as part of the Third Fleet, and helped support the [[Battle of Peleliu|landings on Peleliu]] on 17 September. She then protected the carriers during air strikes against the Central Philippines to neutralize enemy air power for the long-awaited invasion of the Philippines. On 10 October, ''Iowa'' arrived off [[Okinawa]] for a series of air strikes on the [[Ryukyu Islands]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. She then supported air strikes against [[Luzon]] on 18 October and continued this duty during General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[Battle of Leyte|landing on Leyte]] on 20 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt;

In a last-ditch attempt to halt the United States campaign to recapture the Philippines, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] struck back with ''Shō-Gō'' 1, a three-pronged attack aimed at the destruction of American amphibious forces in [[Leyte Gulf]]. The plan called for Vice-Admiral [[Jisaburō Ozawa]] to use the surviving Japanese carriers as bait to draw US carriers of TF 38 away from the Philippine beachheads, allowing Imperial Japanese Admirals [[Takeo Kurita]], [[Kiyohide Shima]], and [[Shōji Nishimura]] to take surface task forces through the [[San Bernardino Strait]] and [[Surigao Strait]], where they would rendezvous and attack the US beachheads.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iowa'' accompanied TF 38 during attacks against the Japanese Central Force under the command of Admiral Kurita as it steamed through the [[Sibuyan Sea]] toward San Bernardino Strait. The reported results of these attacks and the apparent retreat of the Japanese Central Force led Admiral [[William F. Halsey|William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey]] to believe that this force had been ruined as an effective fighting group; as a result, ''Iowa'', with TF 38, steamed after the Japanese Northern Force off [[Cape Engaño (Luzon)|Cape Engaño]], Luzon. On 25 October 1944, when the ships of the Northern Force were almost within range of ''Iowa''{{'}}s guns, word arrived that the Japanese Central Force was attacking a group of American [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]] off [[Samar (island)|Samar]]. This threat to the American beachheads forced TF 38 to reverse course and steam to support the vulnerable escort carrier fleet. However, the fierce resistance put up by the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] in the [[Battle off Samar]] had already caused the Japanese to retire and ''Iowa'' was denied a surface action. Following the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], ''Iowa'' remained in the waters off the Philippines screening carriers during strikes against Luzon and Formosa. She sailed for the West Coast late in December 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:USS Iowa 1945 LOC 182971pu.jpg|thumb|left|''Iowa'' in drydock in San Francisco, undergoing repairs and modernization after being damaged during Typhoon Cobra]]

On 18 December, the ships of TF 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|Typhoon Cobra]] overtook the force—seven fleet carriers, six light carriers, eight battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 destroyers—during their attempt to refuel at sea. At the time, the ships were operating about {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Luzon in the [[Philippine Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PT&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Typhoons and Hurricanes: Pacific Typhoon, 18&amp;nbsp;December 1944 | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq102-4.htm | work=|publisher=United States Navy | accessdate=8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carriers had just completed three days of heavy raids against Japanese airfields, suppressing enemy aircraft during the American [[amphibious assault|amphibious operations]] against [[Mindoro]] in the Philippines. The task force rendezvoused with [[Captain (U.S. Navy)#U.S. Navy|Captain]] Jasper T. Acuff and his fueling group on 17 December with the intention of refueling all ships in the task force and replacing lost aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cobra&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Third Fleet in Typhoon Cobra, December 1944 | url = http://www.compass.dircon.co.uk/cobra2.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051018002436/http://www.compass.dircon.co.uk/cobra2.htm | archivedate = 18 October 2005 | work=History of US Naval Operations in World War II |publisher=Samuel Eliot Morison | accessdate=8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the sea had been growing rougher all day, the nearby cyclonic disturbance gave relatively little warning of its approach. On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the task force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the vessels were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane-force winds. Three destroyers–{{USS|Hull|DD-350|2}}, {{USS|Monaghan|DD-354|2}}, and {{USS|Spence|DD-512|2}}–capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;PT&quot;/&gt; Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured. Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars, and some 146 planes on various ships were swept overboard or damaged beyond economical repair by fires or impacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cobra&quot;/&gt; ''Iowa'' reported zero injured sailors as a result of the typhoon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Pacific Typhoon, 18 December: Personnel Casualties Suffered by Third Fleet, 17–18 December 1944, Compiled from Official Sources | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq102-4c.htm | work=|publisher=United States Navy | accessdate=8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but suffered a loss of one of her float planes, and damage to one of her shafts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cobra&quot;/&gt; The damaged shaft required ''Iowa'' to return to the US, and she arrived at San Francisco on 15 January 1945, for repairs. During the course of the overhaul ''Iowa'' had her bridge area enclosed, and was outfitted with new search radars and fire-control systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

''Iowa'' sailed on 19 March 1945 for Okinawa, arriving on 15 April to relieve her sister ship {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}. From 24 April, ''Iowa'' supported carrier operations which aimed to establish and maintain air superiority for ground forces during their struggle for the island. She then supported air strikes off southern [[Kyūshū]] from 25 May to 13 June. Afterward, she sailed toward northern [[Honshū]] and [[Hokkaidō]], and participated in strikes on the Japanese home islands on 14–15 July by bombarding [[Muroran, Hokkaidō|Muroran]], Hokkaidō, destroying steel mills and other targets. The city of [[Hitachi, Ibaraki|Hitachi]] on Honshū was shelled beginning the night of 17 July and lasting to 18 July. On 29 and 30 July, ''Iowa'' trained her guns on [[Kahoolawe]]&lt;!--in Hawaii?  back from Japan??--&gt; for a bombardment and continued to support fast carrier strikes until the cessation of hostilities on 15 August as a result of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

On 27 August, ''Iowa'' and her sister ship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}} entered [[Sagami Bay]] to oversee the surrender of the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt; Two days later, she entered [[Tokyo Bay]] with the occupation forces. Here, a number of sailors from the ''Missouri'' were temporarily stationed on ''Iowa'' for the duration of the surrender ceremony which took place aboard the ''Missouri''.&lt;ref name=Missouri-DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Missouri | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/m/missouri-iii.html | accessdate =14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving as Admiral Halsey's flagship for the surrender ceremony on 2 September, ''Iowa'' remained in the bay as part of the occupying force. As part of the ongoing [[Operation Magic Carpet]], she received homeward bound GIs and liberated US [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] before departing Tokyo Bay on 20 September, bound for the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

==Post-World War II (1945–49)==
''Iowa'' arrived in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], on 15 October 1945, then sailed for [[Long Beach, California]], where she engaged in training operations until returning to Japan in 1946 to serve as flagship for the 5th Fleet. She returned to the United States on 25 March 1946 and resumed her role as a training ship. During her usual routine of drills and maneuvers she also embarked Naval Reserve elements and [[midshipman|midshipmen]] for training. In October, ''Iowa'' underwent a period of overhaul and modernization, which resulted in the addition of the SK-2 Radar and the loss of a number of 20&amp;nbsp;mm and 40&amp;nbsp;mm gun mounts. In July, following the [[Bikini atomic experiments]], the old battleship {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}} was selected as a target for a [[live fire exercise]] to be carried out by ''Iowa'' and other sea and air assets of the navy. The exercise began with separate shellings from a [[destroyer]], [[Heavy Cruiser|heavy cruiser]], and ''Iowa'', but this did not sink the ship, and so ''Nevada'' was finished off with one [[aerial torpedo]] hit amidships, sinking her {{convert|65|mi|km|abbr=on}} from [[Pearl Harbor]] on 31 July 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bonner, Kermit| title=Final Voyages|publisher=Turner Publishing Company | isbn=1-56311-289-2 | year=1996|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NVR url|id=BB36|title=''Nevada''}}. [[Naval Vessel Register]]. The Department of Defense. Retrieved on 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1948, as part of the post World War II draw down of the armed forces, ''Iowa'' was inactivated at San Francisco and formally decommissioned into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]] on 24 March 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

==Korean War (1951–52)==
In 1950, [[North Korea]] [[Korean War|invaded]] South Korea, prompting NATO members, including the United States, to intervene in the name of the United Nations. President [[Harry S. Truman]] was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but he quickly ordered US forces stationed in Japan to transfer to South Korea. Truman also sent US based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to the area to support South Korea. As part of the naval mobilization, ''Iowa'' was reactivated on 14 July 1951, and formally recommissioned on 25 August, with Captain William R. Smedberg, III, in command. ''Iowa'' sailed for Korean waters in March 1952. On 1 April she relieved her sister ship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64}} and became the flagship of [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Robert P. Briscoe]], Commander of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt; In her first combat operation of the Korean War, ''Iowa'' fired her main guns near Wonsan-[[Sŏngjin]] on 8 April 1952, with the goal of striking North Korean supply lines. In the company of other naval vessels ''Iowa'' again engaged North Korean forces the following day, this time against enemy troop concentrations, supply areas, and suspected gun positions in and around [[Suwon Dan]] and [[Kojo, Korea|Kojo]]. In support of South Korea's [[I Corps (South Korea)|I Corps]], ''Iowa'' shelled enemy positions on 13 April, killing 100 enemy soldiers, destroying six gun emplacements, and wrecking a division headquarters. The next day she entered [[Wonsan]] Harbor and shelled warehouses, observation posts and railroad marshaling yards before moving out to rejoin the UN flotilla aiding ground forces around [[Kosong]]. On 20 April, in her first combat action above the [[38th parallel north#Korea|38th parallel]], ''Iowa'' shelled railroad lines at [[Tanchon]], where four railroad tunnels were destroyed, before sailing to [[Chindong]] and Kosong for a two-day bombardment of North Korean positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:USS Iowa (BB-61) fires at North Korean target in mid-1952.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''Iowa'' fires a {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} shell towards a North Korean target in 1952.]]

On 25 May ''Iowa'', following her sister ship ''Missouri''{{'}}s example, arrived in the waters off [[Chongjin]], a North Korean industrial center approximately {{convert|48|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} from the Russian border. Upon arrival, ''Iowa'' proceeded to shell the industrial and rail transportation centers in Chongjin, after which she moved south to aid the [[X Corps (United States)|US X Corps]]. ''En route'' to US positions, ''Iowa'' again bombarded Sŏngjin, destroying several railroad tunnels and bridges in the area. On 28 May, ''Iowa'' rejoined the main body of the US fleet supporting the X Corps, heavily shelling several islands in Wonsan Harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

Throughout June, ''Iowa'' trained her guns on targets at [[Mayang-do]], Tanchon, Chongjin, [[Chodo]]-[[Sokcho]] and the ports of [[Hŭngnam]] and Wonsan in support of the UN and South Korean forces. On 9 June, a helicopter from ''Iowa'' rescued a downed pilot from the carrier {{USS|Princeton|CV-37|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt; At the time, ''Princeton'' was operating with TF&amp;nbsp;77, and with other carriers in the task force who were involved in a bombing campaign against North Korean supply lines, troop concentrations, and infrastructure; additionally, the carriers were flying [[close air support]] missions for ground forces fighting against the North Korean forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Princeton | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/p/princeton-v.html | accessdate =14 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, ''Iowa'' received a new skipper, Captain Joshua W. Cooper, who assumed command of the battleship for the remainder of her Korean War tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

On 20 August, ''Iowa'' took aboard nine wounded men from the destroyer {{USS|Thompson|DD-627|2}} after ''Thompson'' was hit by a Chinese artillery battery while shelling enemy positions at Sŏngjin. At the time, ''Iowa'' was operating {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Sŏngjin, and after receiving the wounded destroyer crewmen, ''Iowa'' covered ''Thompson'' as she retreated into safer waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Thompson | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/thompson-ii.html | accessdate =14 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:USS Iowa (BB-61) firing her 406 mm guns at North Korean coastal defenses in 1952.jpg|thumb|right|''Iowa'' fires her guns off the coast of Koje on 17 October 1952.]]

On 23 September, [[General (United States)|General]] [[Mark W. Clark]], the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard ''Iowa''. Clark observed ''Iowa'' in action as her guns shelled the Wonsan area for a third time, accounting for the destruction of a major enemy [[ammunition dump]]. On 25 September, ''Iowa'' fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30-car train.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt; The following month, ''Iowa'' was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a [[feint]] to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them within striking distance of the battleships' big guns. During the operation, ''Iowa'' provided anti-aircraft support to {{USS|Mount McKinley|AGC-7|2}}, an amphibious force command ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

===Post-Korean War (1953–57)===
''Iowa'' embarked midshipmen for at-sea training to Northern Europe in July 1953, and shortly afterwards took part in Operation Mariner, a major NATO exercise, serving as flagship of Vice Admiral [[Edmund T. Wooldridge]], commander of the [[United States Second Fleet|2nd Fleet]]. Upon completion of this exercise, ''Iowa'' operated in the [[Virginia Capes]] area. Later, in September 1954, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral R. E. Libby, Commander, Battleship Cruiser Force, United States Atlantic Fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt;

From January–April 1955, ''Iowa'' made an extended cruise to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as the flagship of the Commander, [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]]. She departed on a midshipman training cruise on 1 June, and upon her return entered Norfolk for a four-month overhaul. Afterward, ''Iowa'' continued intermittent training cruises and operational exercises, until 4 January 1957 when she departed Norfolk for duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Upon completion, ''Iowa'' embarked midshipmen for a South American training cruise and joined in the International [[Naval Review]] off [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] on 13 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt;

On 3 September, ''Iowa'' sailed for Scotland for NATO's [[Operation Strikeback]]. She returned to Norfolk on 28 September, and departed Hampton Roads for the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] on 22 October. She was decommissioned on 24 February 1958 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt;

==Reactivation (1982–84)==
[[Image:Iowa Modernization.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''Iowa'' in drydock undergoing modernization]]

As part of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s and  [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to create an expanded [[600-ship Navy]], ''Iowa'' was reactivated and moved under tow to [[Avondale Shipyard]] near [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], for refitting and equipment modernization in advance of her planned recommissioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa-DANFS&quot;/&gt; During the refit, ''Iowa'' had all of her remaining [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm]] anti-aircraft guns removed, due to their ineffectiveness against modern [[Fighter aircraft|fighter jets]] and [[anti-ship missile]]s. Additionally, the two {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} gun mounts located at mid-ship and in the [[:wikt:aft|aft]] on the [[Port (nautical)|port]] and [[starboard]] sides of the battleship were removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS Iowa&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = BB-61 Iowa-class | format = specifications | url = https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm | publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] | date = 21 October 2000 | accessdate=26 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iowa'' was then towed to [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]], [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt; where over the next several months the battleship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available. Among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 [[Boeing Harpoon|AGM-84 Harpoon]] anti-ship missiles, eight [[Armored Box Launcher]] mounts for 32 [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] missiles, and a quartet of [[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanx]] [[Close-in weapon system]] [[Gatling gun]]s for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS Iowa&quot;/&gt; ''Iowa'' was the first battleship to receive the [[RQ-2 Pioneer]] [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]]. She could carry up to eight of the remotely controlled drones, which replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16&amp;nbsp;inch (410&amp;nbsp;mm)/50 cal Mark 7 guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=1100&amp;tid=2100&amp;ct=1 |title=RQ-2A ''Pioneer'' Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) |accessdate=8 January 2009 |author=United States Navy |authorlink=United States Navy |date=28 August 2008 |publisher=United States Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fas drone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/program/collect/pioneer.htm |title=Pioneer Short Range (SR) UAV |accessdate=2 March 2007 |last=Pike |first=John |date=5 March 2000 |publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included in her modernization were upgrades to [[radar]] and [[fire-control system]]s for her guns and missiles, and improved [[electronic warfare]] capabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS Iowa&quot;/&gt; Armed as such, ''Iowa'' was formally recommissioned on 28 April 1984, ahead of schedule, within her budget at a cost of $500&amp;nbsp;million, and under the command of Captain Gerald E. Gneckow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt; In order to expedite the schedule, many necessary repairs to ''Iowa''{{'s}} engines and guns were not completed and the mandatory Navy [[Board of Inspection and Survey]] (InSurv) inspection was skipped.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 26. Although ''Iowa'' was refurbished within budget, the final price tag was $50&amp;nbsp;million above the originally projected cost, mainly because of overtime pay for the ship's contractors.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakedown and NATO exercises (1984–89)===
From April–August 1984, ''Iowa'' underwent refresher training and naval gunfire support qualifications in the Atlantic Ocean. She spent the rest of 1984 on a [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] cruise in the area around Central America. During this cruise she aided in several humanitarian operations, including in [[Costa Rica]] and [[Honduras]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farrar |first=George |date=October 1985 |title=Civic action in Costa Rica |journal=All Hands |issue=823 |pages=40–1 |publisher=Naval Media Center |location=Washington D.C. |url=http://www.navy.mil/media/allhands/acrobat/ah198510.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2009 |issn=0002-5577}}&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to the United States in April 1985 for a period of routine maintenance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Uss iowa bb-61 pr.jpg|thumb|right|''Iowa'' fires a full broadside of nine {{convert|16|in|adj=on}}/50-caliber and six {{convert|5|in|adj=on}}/38 cal guns during a target exercise near [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques Island]], [[Puerto Rico]], on 1 July 1984. [[Shock wave]]s are visible in the water.]]

In August 1985, ''Iowa'' joined 160 other ships for Exercise Ocean Safari, a NATO naval exercise aimed at testing NATO's ability to control sea lanes and maintain free passage of shipping. Owing to bad weather, ''Iowa'' and the other ships were forced to ride out rough seas, but ''Iowa'' made use of the time to practice hiding herself from enemy forces. While serving with the exercise force, ''Iowa'' crossed the [[Arctic Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| date=January 1986 |title=Ocean Safari '85 |journal=All Hands |issue=826 |page=29 |publisher=Naval Media Center |location=Washington D.C. |url=http://www.navy.mil/media/allhands/acrobat/ah198601.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2009 |issn=0002-5577}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, she took part in Baltic operations, and fired her phalanx guns, {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns in the [[Baltic Sea]] on 17 October while operating with US and other allied ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dooley |first=Alan |date=May 1986 |title=Into the bear's backyard |journal=All Hands |issue=830 |pages=26–31 |publisher=Naval Media Center |location=Washington D.C. |url=http://www.navy.mil/media/allhands/acrobat/ah198605.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2009 |issn=0002-5577}}&lt;/ref&gt; After these operations she returned to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

Beginning on 17 March 1986, ''Iowa'' underwent her overdue [[InSurv]] inspection. The inspection, which ''Iowa'' ultimately failed, was conducted under the supervision of Rear Admiral [[John D. Bulkeley]]. Bulkeley found that the ship was unable to achieve her top speed of {{convert|33|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} during a full-power engine run, and recommended to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] and Lehman that ''Iowa'' be taken out of service immediately. Rejecting this advice, Lehman instead instructed the leaders of the Atlantic Fleet to ensure that ''Iowa''{{'}}s deficiencies were corrected.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 26–7. The problems discovered during Bulkeley's inspection included [[hydraulic fluid]] leaks in all three main gun turrets, totaling 55&amp;nbsp;gallons per turret per week; Cosmoline (anticorrosion lubricant) which had not been removed from all the guns; deteriorated bilge piping; frequent shorts in the electrical wiring; pump failures; unrepaired soft patches on high-pressure steam lines; and frozen valves in the ship's firefighting system. Main Turret Three leaked so much oil, hydraulic fluid, and water that the crew referred to it as the &quot;rain forest&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, ''Iowa'' returned to the waters around Central America and conducted drills and exercises while providing a military presence to friendly nations. On 4 July, President [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]] boarded ''Iowa'' for the International [[Naval Review]], which was held in the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster-Simeon |first=E. |date=September 1986 |title=Liberty Weekend |journal=All Hands |issue=834 |page=21 |publisher=Naval Media Center |location=Washington D.C. |url=http://www.navy.mil/media/allhands/acrobat/ah198609.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2009 |issn=0002-5577}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April, CAPT [[Larry Seaquist|Larry Ray Seaquist]] assumed command of the battleship and her crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 28, gives 25 April as the date of the change of command.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August, ''Iowa'' set sail for the North Atlantic, and in September she participated in Exercise Northern Wedding by ferrying [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] ashore and assisting helicopter gunships. During the exercise ''Iowa'' fired her main guns at [[Cape Wrath]] range in Scotland in support of a simulated [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] on 5–6 September, firing a total of 19 {{convert|16|in|adj=on}} shells and 32 {{convert|5|in|adj=on}} shells during a 10-hour period and operating in rough seas. During the live fire exercise, a small number of ''Iowa'' marines were put ashore to monitor the fall of shot and advise the battleship of gunnery corrections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connors |first=Tracy |date=January 1987 |title=Northern Wedding '86 |journal=All Hands |issue=838 |page=26 |publisher=Naval Media Center |location=Washington D.C. |url=http://www.navy.mil/media/allhands/acrobat/ah198701.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2009 |issn=0002-5577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, ''Iowa'' visited ports in England and Germany before returning to the United States in October.

[[Image:Iowa drone.jpg|thumb|left|Crewmen recover an RQ-2 Pioneer [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] aboard ''Iowa''.]]

In December, the ship became the testbed for the Navy's [[RQ-2 Pioneer|RQ-2&amp;nbsp;Pioneer]] [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]] (UAV). The drone was designed to serve as an aerial spotter for the battleship's guns, thereby allowing the guns to be used against an enemy without the need for an airplane or helicopter spotter. Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard ''Iowa''.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas drone&quot;/&gt;
[[File:USS Iowa (BB-61) alongside USS Midway (CV-41) in 1987.JPEG|thumb|''Iowa'' conducting an [[underway replenishment]] with {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}} in the [[Persian Gulf]] in December 1987]]
From January–September 1987 ''Iowa'' operated in the waters in and around Central America and participated in several exercises until sailing for the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on 10 September to join the 6th Fleet based there. She remained in the Mediterranean until 22 October, when she was detached from the 6th Fleet and departed for operations in the North Sea. On 25 November, as part of [[Operation Earnest Will]], ''Iowa'' transited the [[Suez Canal]] and set sail for the [[Persian Gulf]], which at the time was one of the battlefields of the first Gulf War (also referred to as the [[Iran–Iraq War]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt; The presence of US naval vessels in the gulf was in response to a formal petition from [[Kuwait]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Kuwaiti Call for Help Led to U.S. Role in Gulf |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=4 July 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose ships were being raided by Iranian forces who were attempting to cut off weapons shipments from the United States and Europe to [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime in Iraq, via Kuwaiti territory. This phase of the war would later be called the &quot;[[Tanker War]]&quot; phase of the Iran-Iraq War.&lt;ref name=kelley-0706&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Kelley | first=Stephen Andrew | title=Better Lucky Than Good: Operation Earnest Will as Gunboat Diplomacy | publisher=[[Naval Postgraduate School]] |date = June 2007| url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/kelley07.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=9 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iowa'' and other vessels operating in the gulf were assigned to escort Kuwaiti tankers from Kuwaiti ports to the open sea, but because US law forbade military escorts for civilian ships flying a foreign flag, the tankers escorted by the United States were reflagged as US merchant vessels and assigned American names.&lt;ref name=kelley-0706/&gt; For the remainder of the year ''Iowa'' escorted Kuwaiti gas and oil tankers reflagged as US merchant ships from the Persian Gulf through the [[Strait of Hormuz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;

On 20 February 1988, ''Iowa'' departed from the Persian Gulf, transited the Suez Canal, and set sail for the United States, arriving at Norfolk on 10 March for routine maintenance. In April, she participated in the annual Fleet Week celebrations before returning to Norfolk for an overhaul. On 26 May, [[Fred Moosally]] replaced Larry Seaquist as Captain of the ''Iowa''.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt; After the overhaul, Moosally took ''Iowa'' on a shakedown cruise around [[Chesapeake Bay]] on 25 August. Encountering difficulty in conning the ship through shallow water, Moosally narrowly missed colliding with the [[frigate]] {{USS|Moinester|FF-1097|2}}, destroyer {{USS|Farragut|DDG-37|2}}, and the cruiser {{USS|South Carolina|CGN-37|2}} before running aground in soft mud outside the bay's main ship channel near the Thimble Shoals. After one hour, ''Iowa'' was able to extricate herself without damage and return to port.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 58–60. According to Thompson, the near-misses with the other navy ships were recorded in ''Iowa''{{'}}s log as attempts to &quot;render honors&quot; to them. Although other US Navy vessels observed ''Iowa'' grounded in the mud, the incident apparently was not acted upon by Moosally's superiors. Mike Fahey, the ship's executive officer, warned the other officers on ''Iowa'' to never mention the grounding to anyone, including superior Navy officers.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iowa'' continued with sea trials throughout August and September, then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October, during which the ship passed an Operation Propulsion Program Evaluation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 65–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 1989, during an improperly authorized gunnery experiment off [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques Island]], ''Iowa'' fired a {{convert|16|in|adj=on}} shell {{convert|23.4|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}, setting a record for the longest-ranged {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} shell ever fired. In February, the battleship sailed for [[New Orleans]] for a port visit before departing for Norfolk. On 10 April, the battleship was visited by the commander of the 2nd Fleet, and on 13 April she sailed to participate in a fleet exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa I&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 70-7. 20 January long-range, experimental shot was not authorized by the Department of the Navy. The shot was planned and directed by ''Iowa''{{'}}s Master Chief Fire Controlman Stephen Skelley and Gunnery Officer Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Michael Costigan using increased powder charges and specially-designed shells. The Turret One gun crew leaders considered defying the order because of the unauthorized nature and perceived danger of the experiment, but in the end fired the experimental loads. John McEachren, a mid-level civilian employee at the Navy's Sea Systems Command, improperly authorized the experiment without informing his superiors.&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Iowa'' was undergoing modernization in the early 1980s, her sister ship {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}} had been dispatched to Lebanon to provide offshore fire support.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJ DANFS&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = New Jersey | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/n/new-jersey-ii.html | accessdate =8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, ''New Jersey'' was the only commissioned battleship anywhere in the world, and it was found that, in an effort to get another battleship commissioned to relieve ''New Jersey'', the modernization of ''Iowa'' was stepped up, leaving her in poor condition when she recommissioned in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;cu&quot;/&gt; It was also determined that Captain Fred Moosally was more concerned with the maintenance of the missiles than the training and manning of guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garzke&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Garzke |first=William H. |author2=Dulin, Robert O.  |title=Battleships |url=http://www.combie.net/webharbor/museum/bb61-2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311000204/http://www.combie.net/webharbor/museum/bb61-2.html|archivedate=11 March 2007|accessdate=24 August 2008 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |year=1995|page=|nopp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powder from the same lot as the one under investigation was tested at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division]]. [[Spontaneous combustion]] was achieved with the powder, which had been originally milled in the 1930s and improperly stored in a barge at the Navy's [[Yorktown, Virginia]] Naval Weapons Station during a 1988 dry-docking of ''Iowa''.&lt;ref name=&quot;memories&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fas 16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide&quot;/&gt; As it degrades, gunpowder gives off [[ether]] gas, which is highly flammable and could be ignited by a spark. This revelation resulted in a shift in the Navy's position on the incident, and Admiral [[Frank Kelso]], the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] at the time, publicly apologized to the Hartwig family, concluding that there was no real evidence to support the claim that he had intentionally killed the other sailors.&lt;ref name=&quot;memories&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At the same time, he also pointed out that there was not enough evidence to exonerate Hartwig of the alleged charges, either.

[[File:USS Iowa (BB-61) decommissions.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A flag hoist lies on the deck near the bow of ''Iowa'' following the ship's decommissioning ceremony at [[Norfolk, Virginia]]]]

With the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget and the battleships were deemed uneconomical; as a result, ''Iowa'' was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990, after a total of 19 years of commissioned service. She was the first of the reactivated battleships to be decommissioned, and this was done earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged turret. ''Iowa'' was originally berthed at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] and later at [[Naval Station Newport]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when the ship began her journey under tow to California. The ship arrived in [[Suisun Bay]] near San Francisco on 21 April 2001 and joined the [[reserve fleet]] there, where she remained in reserve until struck again from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in March 2006. She and her sister ships had been struck previously in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS Iowa&quot;/&gt; She remained at the Suisun Bay anchorage until November 2011.

[[File:NISMF Philadelphia 1995 DN-SC-97-00422.JPG|thumb|The [[Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility]] at [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] in 1995; ''Iowa'' is the battleship moored on the seaside of the wharf in the far left of the picture, next to {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}}.

Section 1011 of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] of 1996 required the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the ''Iowa''-class battleships that had been struck by the Navy in 1995; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy reserve fleets (or &quot;mothball fleet&quot;). The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in the Marine Corps' amphibious operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDAA1996&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1995_r/h104406.htm |title=National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996 (Subtitle B-Naval Vessels and Shipyards) |publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=20 September 2012 |date=13 December 1995 |page=844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to ''Iowa''’s damaged turret, the Navy selected ''New Jersey'' for placement into the mothball fleet, even though the training mechanisms on ''New Jersey'''s {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns had been welded down. The cost to fix ''New Jersey'' was considered less than the cost to fix ''Iowa'';&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS Iowa&quot;/&gt; as a result, ''New Jersey'' and ''Wisconsin'' were reinstated to the Naval Vessel Register and placed back in the reserve fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDAA1996&quot;/&gt;

''New Jersey'' remained there until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 required the [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] to list and maintain ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' on the Naval Vessel Register. The Act also required the Secretary of the Navy to strike ''New Jersey'' from the Naval Vessel Register and transfer the battleship to a not-for-profit entity in accordance with section 7306 of [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10, United States Code]]. It also required the transferee to locate the battleship in the [[New Jersey|State of New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/1999NDAA.pdf |format=PDF |title=Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 (Subtitle B-Naval Vessels and Shipyards) |accessdate=12 March 2007 |publisher=105th Congress, United States Senate and House of Representatives |pages=200–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy made the switch in January 1999, allowing ''New Jersey'' to open as a museum ship in her namesake state.&lt;ref name=&quot;showboat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.battleshipnewjersey.org/history/milestone_dates.php |title=Battleship New Jersey |publisher=Battleship New Jersey Museum and Memorial|accessdate=26 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 2006, the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] exercised his authority to strike ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' from the NVR, which cleared the way for both ships to be donated for use as [[museum ship]]s, but the United States Congress remained &quot;deeply concerned&quot; over the loss of the naval surface gunfire support that the battleships provided, and noted that &quot;navy efforts to improve upon, much less replace, this capability have been highly problematic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NDAA 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/hr109-452/title2.pdf| title = National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 | accessdate =12 March 2007 | format = PDF | pages = 193–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a partial consequence, Congress passed {{USPL|109|163}}, the National Defense Authorization Act 2006, requiring that the battleships be kept and maintained in a state of readiness should they ever be needed again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress 68&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?sel=DOC&amp;&amp;item=&amp;r_n=hr452.109&amp;&amp;&amp;sid=cp109WUZzm&amp;&amp;refer=&amp;&amp;&amp;db_id=cp109&amp;&amp;hd_count=&amp; |title=House Report 109-452—National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007: Report of the Committee on Armed Services (House of Representatives) on H.R. 5122 together with Additional and Dissenting Views |accessdate=15 January 2009 |author=Committee on Armed Services (House of Representatives) |date=6 May 2006 |work=National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress ordered that  measures be implemented to ensure that, if need be, ''Iowa'' could be returned to active duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress 68&quot;/&gt; These measures closely mirrored the original three conditions that the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 laid out for the maintenance of ''Iowa'' while she was in the &quot;mothball fleet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS Iowa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress 104&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=104th Congress, House of Representatives |url=http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/1996NDAA.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 |accessdate=17 December 2006 |date=10 February 1996 |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfw&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ron |last=Russel |title=USS Iowa, Any Takers? |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2007-09-12/news/battleship-anyone/ |agency=Village Voice Media |work=San Francisco Weekly |location=San Francisco, California |date=11 September 2007 |accessdate=17 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
