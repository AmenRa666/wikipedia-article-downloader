==Unknown==
are you soure WAVE is an acronym and not a backronym¡?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/190.161.61.85|190.161.61.85]] ([[User talk:190.161.61.85|talk]]) 01:18, 30 June 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Is this correct? ==

I moved the following paragraph here because I could not verify it.  Sources I've seen indicate that the WAVES were disbanded after WWII:

The WAVES continued to serve through the [[Vietnam War]].  WAVES officer candidates were trained for 16 weeks at the Newport, Rhode Island Naval Base.  Enlisted WAVES were trained at [[Bainbridge, Maryland]].  During the 1970's consideration was given to allowing WAVES to serve aboard ships.  Ultimately, LT Valerie Zeller, USNR,  was assigned to two weeks reserve duty aboard the USS Sanctuary in 1975.  A few years later, the WAVES were disbanded and women were allowed to serve on ships and be assigned to all Navy specialties.

**The WAVES were NOT disbanded at the end of World War II.  Most of them were discharged, but a small number of dedicated officers and enlisted women under the leadership of Captain Joy Bright Hancock were laying plans for a campaign to have the WAVES made a permanent part of the Regular Navy.  Their hard work paid off in 1948, when the women's components of all the armed forces were made permanent.

See Hancock, Capt. Joy Bright, ''Lady in the Navy'' US Naval Institute Press.

I have re-written some of the opening paragraphs explaining the differences between the WAAC, WAC, and WAVES.  I realize this article is not about the WAAC or the WAC, but it incorrectly stated that the WAC came into existence about two months before the WAVES.  In fact it was the WAAC (Women's AUXILIARY Army Corps).  Also, it's not really possible to discuss the beginning of any of the women's services without some mention of the others.

I am also wondering whether the famous WAVE uniform designed by Mainbocher should be mentioned.  This article is not about fashion, but in the beginning proper uniforms were a major consideration.  It also demonstrates how the Navy took a more organized approach to these issues than the Army did, and why the WAVE uniform was somewhat more fashionable than the uniform of the WAAC/WAC.

== Mildred Fover??? ==

The article stated that the first Director of the WAVES was '''Mildred H. Fover'''.  I have no idea where that came from, but I have corrected the mistake by changing the name to Mildred McAfee, who was in fact first Director of the WAVES, as is mentioned further along in the article.

::I only wish I could substantiate my dim memory that [[Grace Hopper]], late in her career, was in the habit of calling herself &quot;The last WAVE&quot;. 

== White uniform ==

Have I correctly identified this uniform? [[User:Jim.henderson|Jim.henderson]] ([[User talk:Jim.henderson|talk]]) 11:42, 18 November 2013 (UTC)

:Apparently yes, being a good match for [[:File:Waves recruiting poster.jpg]] which is a better illustration anyway. [[User:Jim.henderson|Jim.henderson]] ([[User talk:Jim.henderson|talk]]) 21:51, 19 November 2013 (UTC)


=== PURSE ===

It appears to be the correct dress white uniform for an enlisted WAVE during World War II.  The one thing wrong is the color of the purse, which I believe should have been white, though I believe this rule was later relaxed and I've also heard of a white cover that could be put on the standard black purse.

My source is the letters my late mother wrote home during her service with the WAVES in World War II in which she discussed buying a dress white uniform from another WAVE, but she was apparently not able to acquire the white purse before the war ended.

:Thank you. I have made a note in the description in [[:Commons:File:WAVE uniform WWII N-Y HS jeh.jpg]] and would appreciate any corrections. [[User:Jim.henderson|Jim.henderson]] ([[User talk:Jim.henderson|talk]]) 15:33, 9 December 2013 (UTC)

== Article improvement ==


The article lists an abundance of reference sources (under numerous headings), yet very little of the WAVES story has found its way into the article itself. Should anyone be watching this page, I plan to begin expanding the article with the expectation of upgrading its Start-class rating.

First, though, lets turn to the lead, which incorrectly states, ‘‘their official name was the U.S. Naval Reserve (Women's Reserve), but the nickname as the WAVES stuck.’’ Actually, the official name was Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service. Elisabeth Raynard, attached to the U.S. Navy from Barnard College, constructed the name. In explaining how she came up with the nautical name, Reynard said: “I realized that there were two letters which had to be in it: W for women and V for volunteer, because the Navy wants to make it clear that this is a voluntary service and not a drafted service. So I played with those two letters and the idea of the sea and finally came up with Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service – WAVES”.

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[WAVES]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=699074607 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20110509071122/http://www.history.navy.mil/ar/bravo/bupers-00w.htm to http://www.history.navy.mil/ar/bravo/bupers-00w.htm
