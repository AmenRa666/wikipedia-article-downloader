The '''Cambodian–Thai border dispute''' began in June 2008 as the latest round of a century-long dispute between Cambodia and Thailand involving the area surrounding the 11th century [[Preah Vihear Temple]], in the [[Dângrêk Mountains]] between the [[Choam Khsant District|Choam Khsant]] district in the [[Preah Vihear Province|Preah Vihear]] Province of northern Cambodia and the [[Amphoe Kantharalak|Kantharalak]] district (''[[amphoe]]'') in [[Sisaket Province]] of [[northeastern Thailand]].

According to the Cambodian ambassador to the United Nations, the most recent dispute began on 15 July 2008 when about 50 Thai soldiers moved into the Keo Sikha Kiri Svara pagoda vicinity which he claims is located in Cambodia's territory about {{convert|300|m}} from the Temple of Preah Vihear.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.un.int/&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/20090511123927/http://www.un.int/cambodia/Bulletin_Files/July08/Letter_18_Jul.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand claims the demarcation has not yet been completed for the external parts of the area adjacent to the temple, which was adjudged to be Cambodian by a nine to three decision of the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) in 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nation5August&quot;&gt;'''The Nation Newspaper'''. August 5, 2008. VOLUME 33 NO 51950&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2008, the dispute had expanded to the 13th century [[Prasat Ta Muen Thom|Ta Moan temple]] complex {{convert|153|km}} west of Preah Vihear ({{coord|14|20|57|N|103|15|59|E|}}), where Cambodia has accused Thai troops of occupying a temple complex it claims is on Cambodian land. The Thai foreign ministry denied that any troops had moved into that area until several were killed in an encounter in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamoan.net/ |title=Thom – Prasat Ta Moan – Ta Muen Temple – Ta Moan Temple – Prasat Ta Muen – Prasat Ta Moan – Khmer Temple Cambodia |publisher=Ta Moan |date=August 3, 2008 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;phnompenhpost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2011042248663/Online-Edition/new-fighting-at-border.html |title=Search, Phnom Penh Post |publisher=Phnompenhpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was reached in December 2011 to withdraw troops from the disputed area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-16294309 |work=BBC News | title=Thailand and Cambodia reach deal on temple border | date=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 2013, the ICJ declared in a unanimous decision that the 1962 ICJ judgment had awarded all of the [[promontory]] of Preah Vihear to Cambodia and that Thailand had an obligation to withdraw any Thai military, police, or guard forces stationed in that area.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICJ-11Nov&quot;/&gt; However, it rejected Cambodia's argument that the judgment had also awarded the hill of Phnom Trap (three kilometers northwest of the temple) to Cambodia, finding that it had made no ruling on sovereignty over the hill.

== Background ==
The Preah Vihear temple area has been the subject of often rancorous debate within Cambodia and Thailand and between the two countries since the late 19th century.

The temple complex was built during the 9th and 10th centuries CE under the auspices of the [[Khmer Empire]]. As the empire reached its zenith and began a [[Dark ages of Cambodia#Cambodia's struggle for survival, 1432-1863|slow decline]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] began to grow into the modern state of Thailand. &lt;!-- Now we are talking about centuries after the Khmer Empire. Please, add general dates -or centuries- for clarity. --&gt;[[Siam]] and Vietnam [[Dark ages of Cambodia#Domination by Thailand and by Vietnam|expanded into]] Cambodian territory in turn during the Ayutthaya, [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]], and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] eras.{{citation needed|date = November 2013}}

The [[Franco-Siamese War#Consequences|Franco-Siamese treaty of 1867]] forced Siam to renounce [[suzerainty]] over Cambodia, with the exception of [[Battambang Province (Thailand)|Battambang]], [[Siem Reap Province|Siem Reap]], [[Banteay Meanchey]], and [[Oddar Meancheay]] Provinces,&lt;ref name=&quot;CaseStudyPhraViharn&quot;&gt;[http://www.charnvitkasetsiri.com/PDF/PreahVihearFor20June.pdf Prasat Phra Viharn – Case study of political history – Nationalism], ''Page 5 of 15'' {{th icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been officially incorporated into the Kingdom of Siam. During the 1904 state visit of [[King Rama V]] to France, Siam agreed to cede the four provinces to France in exchange for regaining Thai sovereignty over [[Trat Province]] and [[Amphoe Dan Sai]] of [[Loei Province]], which had been occupied by France.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaseStudyPhraViharn&quot; /&gt;

In 1907 the Thai-Cambodian border was mapped by the French on behalf of a bilateral border commission. According to the 1904 agreement, the border would follow the natural watershed between the countries. However, the resulting map deviated by showing Preah Vihear Temple as being in Cambodia, even though it is on the Thai side of the watershed. Thailand accepted the map for official use&lt;!-- you need this to fully understand the modern problem--&gt;. The Thais discovered the error when they made their own survey in the 1930s, but the ICJ ruled that they had waited too long to protest and lost the temple by &quot;acquiesance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/45/4857.pdf ''Case Concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits], [1962] I.C.J. Reports 6, p. 23''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Changing provinces titles are very important and complicated. Make sure you get the correct accurate information --&gt;
Immediately prior to [[World War II]], the Thai government attempted to negotiate an adjustment of the border with [[French Indochina]]. However, this came to an end with the [[Battle of France#Surrender and armistice|French surrender in 1940]] to [[Nazi Germany]]. The government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram then pressed the colonial government of French Indochina for the return of territory Thailand had lost in the 1904 and 1907 exchanges: [[Battambang Province (Thailand)|Battambang Province]] of Thailand (modern day [[Battambang Province]] and [[Pailin]] municipality, Cambodia), [[Phibunsongkhram Province]] (modern day [[Siem Reap Province]], [[Oddar Meancheay Province]], and [[Banteay Meanchey Province]] Cambodia), [[Nakhon Champa Sak Province]] (modern day [[Champassack Province]], Laos, [[Preah Vihear Province]], Cambodia), and Saiyaburi Province of Laos (modern day [[Xaignabouli Province]], Laos); ''([[#External links|See map below]]) ''&lt;ref name=&quot;CaseStudyPhraViharn&quot; /&gt; The French colonial government refused to comply and fighting broke out along the border. In December 1940, Phibunsongkhram ordered an outright invasion of French Indochina, starting the [[French-Thai War]]. The Thai army and air force was better equipped and had the advantage of numbers against the [[Vichy France|Colonial French]] forces; they pushed back the French Foreign Legion and French colonial troops with little difficulty. However, the more modern French Navy caught the Thai fleet by surprise and won a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Koh Chang]]. Imperial Japan intervened to mediate the conflict, concerned that the conflict would affect their own plans for Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;EQPlus&quot;&gt;'''Important events during the reign of King Rama VIII''' – Bangkok; E.Q. Plus adventure series, 2008. 160 pages. ISBN 978-974-06-9559-2 {{th icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general [[armistice]] was declared on 28 January 1941. On 9 May a peace treaty was signed in Tokyo, the French being coerced by the Japanese into relinquishing their claim on the territories demanded by Thailand.

On 7 December 1941, a few hours before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Japan demanded the right to move troops across Thailand to the Malayan frontier. Before the Thais could respond, the [[Japanese Invasion of Thailand]] began across the Cambodian border and at seven points along the sea coast. The Thai forces resisted, but were soon beaten by the Japanese. After only six or seven hours, Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] arrived in Bangkok and ordered an immediate ceasefire. Japan was reluctantly granted free passage, and after Japan's easy conquest of [[Singapore]], Phibunsongkhram signed a military alliance with Japan on 21 December 1941. It contained a secret protocol in which Tokyo agreed to help Thailand regain the territories it had lost to the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonial powers. In exchange, Thailand promised to assist Japan in its war against the Allies.

After the end of the war, Prime Minister [[Pridi Phanomyong]] agreed to return the &quot;liberated&quot; territories to France, in return for he and Thailand not being regarded as an aggressor&lt;!-- this was one of the charges at Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes tribunals &quot;waging a war of aggression&quot;--&gt; nor a member of the [[Axis Power#Thailand|Axis Power]]s. He also requested admission to the newly created United Nations. Initially, both the UK and the [[Soviet Union]] regarded Thailand as an aggressor, despite its active anti-Japanese underground movement. The United States intervened in gratitude to the [[Free Thai Movement]] and prevailed on its wartime allies to agree.

With [[Colonial Cambodia#Campaign for independence|Cambodian Independence]] and the French withdrawal in 1953, the Thai military occupied Preah Vihear Temple in 1954 in keeping with the border line of the natural watershed. The temple had been built facing north to serve the plains above it, not those of the Cambodian plain far below. However, based on the 1907 French map, Cambodia protested, insisting that it was inside their territory. Both countries finally agreed to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice and abide by its decision.

In 1962 the [[International Court of Justice|International Court of Justice (ICJ)]] awarded ownership of Preah Vihear Temple to Cambodia by a nine to three vote, stating the 1907 map clearly showed Preah Vihear as being in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/45/4857.pdf ''Case Concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits], [1962] I.C.J. Reports 6''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the court had only ruled that the temple belong to Cambodia, and did not comment on the adjacent land to the north. Thailand reluctantly handed over the temple but continues to claim the surrounding area, insisting the border has never officially been demarcated here.&lt;ref name=&quot;preah-vihear.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preah-vihear.com|title=Preah-Vihear.com - Unesco's World Heritage site|publisher=Preah-vihear.com|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ownership dispute revived in recent years when Cambodia submitted an application to [[UNESCO]] requesting that Preah Vihear be designated as a [[World Heritage site]]. Thailand contended the application requested the designation include the land surrounding the temple, which Thailand still considers its territory. In the interest of cross-border relations Cambodia withdrew the application, and after winning support from Thailand, submitted &lt;!-- new map = new submission, not a re-submission--&gt; a modified map requesting the designation only for the temple itself.

The [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD), a right wing Thai protest group, turned the temple into a [[cause célèbre]] [[wedge issue]] in its battles against the [[People Power Party (Thailand)|People Power Party]] government of Prime Minister [[Samak Sundaravej]] in their attempts to unseat the former and current [[Cabinet of Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://bangkokpost.net/090708_News/09Jul2008_news13.php |work=Bangkok Post | title =WHC plan for Preah Vihear 'most unusual' |accessdate =July 20, 2008|archiveurl=http://khmernz.blogspot.com/2008_07_09_archive.html |archivedate= July 9, 2008
|quote=WHC plan for Preah Vihear 'most unusual' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;news2&quot;/&gt; In 2006 PAD-led street protests led first to the Thai general election of April 2006, largely boycotted by the opposition and won by then-incumbent Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s [[Thai Rak Thai]] Party. This was followed by the military coup of June 2006, which ousted Thaksin, the caretaker prime minister. Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej was viewed as a proxy for the self-exiled Thaksin Shinawatra, who now lives abroad to avoid conviction for corruption.

Across the border, the [[Cambodian People's Party]] (CPP) government of Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] used the possibly coincidental timing of [[UNESCO]]'s annual meeting and the listing of the temple as a [[World Heritage]] site in campaigning for the 27 July 2008 parliamentary election.&lt;ref name=&quot;news2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7507425.stm |title = Political tensions driving temple row |accessdate =July 20, 2008 |last=Head |first=Jonathan |publisher=BBC News | date=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline ==
{{prose|date=November 2013}}

=== Lead-up to 2008 fighting ===
* In January 2008, the Thai Defense Ministry from the 56th Cabinet of Thailand protested Cambodia's attempt to register the temple as a UNESCO World Heritage Site without agreement from Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sanook.com/social/social_239605.php |title=กลาโหม ล็อบบี้ทั่วโลกประณาม เขมร ชนวนระเบิดศึก เขาพระวิหาร ภาค 2 |publisher=News.sanook.com |accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2008, Cambodia informed Thailand of their plan to register Preah Vihear Temple as a World Heritage Site.
* In April 2008, Thailand (the 57th cabinet) and Cambodia planned a talk on the issue before the registration. Thailand insisted that it would support the registration of the temple, but that the process &quot;must not affect the disputed borderline&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2008/04/25/thailand-cambodia-and-unesco-meet-over-preah-vihear/ |title = Thailand, Cambodia and UNESCO meet over Preah Vihear | publisher=The Southeast Asian Archaeology Newsblog |accessdate =July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 18 June 2008, Thailand and Cambodia issued a joint communique regarding the temple registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nationmultimedia.com/2008/07/08/headlines/headlines_30077585.php |title = Joint communique with Cambodia is unconstitutional|accessdate =July 20, 2008|date=July 8, 2008|work=The Nation |location=Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 22 June 2008, Cambodia closed the border crossing to Preah Vihear in response to Thai protests held at the border crossing. The protests were championed by an anti-Thaksin opposition figure, [[Sonthi Limthongkul]], who claimed the government of Thai Prime Minister Samak Sudaravej had gained business concessions in Cambodia in return for ceding Thai territory to Cambodia when negotiating over the Preah Vihear site map that would be presented to UNESCO in [[Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;news2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7011368406 |title = Cambodia Closes Border With Thailand At Preah Vihear Temple | publisher=AHN | date=July 20, 2008 |accessdate =July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 20 June 2008 the ''Nation'' newspaper in Bangkok published an editorial online highly critical of the People's Alliance for Democracy for its use of Preah Vihear temple in its campaign against the People Power Party government of Prime Minister Samak Sudaravej.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2008/06/30/politics/politics_30076876.php |title = Bangkok's Independent Newspaper |accessdate =July 20, 2008 |date = June 30, 2008 |last=Winichakul |first=Thongchai}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 2 July 2008, as UNESCO began its annual meeting in [[Quebec]], Canada, the ''Bangkok Post'' online published a Deutsche Presse-Agentur (German Press Agency) report that erroneously stated that Preah Vihear partially sits on Thai territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=128686 |title = Bangkok Post Breaking News |accessdate =July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Thai government's decision to support Cambodia's bid for World Heritage listing, anti-Thaksin Shinawatra opposition figures mounted a legal challenge against Thai Foreign Minister [[Noppadon Pattama]].
** The Thai Constitutional Court finally upheld the suit on 7 July 2008 in an eight to one judgment that the foreign minister's joint communique with Cambodia was &quot;unconstitutional&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssInvestmentServices/idUSBKK2838520080709 |title = Thai rulings fuel election talk, PM not worried | publisher=Reuters |accessdate =July 20, 2008 | date=July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://enews.mcot.net/view.php?id=5126 |publisher=MCOT English News |title = Thai Court rules Thai-Cambodian communique in breach of charter |accessdate =July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst UNESCO met in Quebec, Canada, there were about 20 Thai people standing and protesting outside holding sign &quot;Noppadon, you are a LIAR&quot; and Thai flags.
* On 8 July 2008, thousands of Phnom Penh residents marched through the streets in celebration of the inscription of Preah Vihear temple by UNESCO. On the same day, the Municipality of Phnom Penh held an evening outdoor concert at [[Wat Phnom]] to celebrate the inscription of Preah Vihear temple by UNESCO earlier in the day. The concert was nationally broadcast on [[Cambodian Television Network|CTN]], emceed by Cambodia's biggest television star and featured traditional Khmer performances as well as a fireworks display. Despite persistent rain, thousands of Cambodians attended.&lt;ref name=&quot;news2&quot;/&gt;
* On 10 July 2008, Thai Foreign Minister Nappadon Pattama resigned over the listing of Preah Vihear by UNESCO.

The statement also said Thai forces had fired 75- and 105-mm shells loaded with [[poisonous gas]] into Cambodia's territory, an allegation that could not be independently verified and that Thailand rejected. A Cambodian field commander claimed that the &quot;poison smoke&quot; caused several soldiers who inhaled it to lose strength in their arms and legs. Col. Suos Sothea, deputy commander of the artillery unit, said that six rounds of cluster shells had landed in villages about {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} inside Cambodia, but caused no casualties since residents had already been evacuated. Col. Tawatchai Samutsakorn, commander of Thailand's 2nd Army Region, denied absolutely that cluster bombs or poison gas had been employed. Tawatchai said one Thai soldier died, bringing the two-day casualty toll to four dead and 17 wounded, and that 15,000 civilians had been evacuated from the area of fighting.

==== July 2011 ====
*Following a request from Cambodia to order Thai troops out of the area, the judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] by a vote of 11–5 ordered both countries to immediately to withdraw their military forces from disputed areas straddling their border and imposed restrictions on both their armies and police forces. A &quot;provisional demilitarized zone&quot; would make Thai troops leave positions they have long occupied and Cambodia's to leave the temple's immediate vicinity. The court also called for officers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to be allowed into the area to observe the cease-fire as called for by the UN Security Council last February.

:Both sides said they were satisfied with the decision. Thai Foreign Minister Kasit, speaking outside the court, said that a withdrawal of armed Cambodians from the temple complex &quot;has been our consistent position.&quot; Further noting that the decision is binding on both countries, he added that Thailand would withdraw its forces and facilitate the observers' deployment, and further agreed to allow unhindered supplies to Cambodian civilian personnel at the temple complex.

:[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Cambodia)|Cambodian Foreign Minister]] [[Hor Namhong]] said a demilitarised zone would mean &quot;a permanent cease-fire...tantamount to a cessation of aggression&quot; by Thailand. He also said he was satisfied with the dispatch of truce observers, which he said Cambodia had been seeking since last February, but made no reference to the demand for Cambodian troops to abandon the temple grounds.

:The court said its ruling would not prejudice any final ruling on where the border in the area between Thailand and Cambodia should fall. It could take the court many months or even years to reach that decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UN orders troops away from temple |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/un-orders-troops-away-from-temple-2315713.html|work=The Independent |date=July 18, 2011 | at=Asia |accessdate=July 18, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Abhisit, caretaker prime minister since the just-concluded [[Thai general election, 2011|Thai general election]], said that Thai soldiers would not pull out of the disputed area until the military of both countries agreed on the mutual withdrawal. &quot;We need to talk to the Cambodians as the Cambodians also have to pull out their troops,&quot; Abhisit said at a news conference in Bangkok. &quot;So there has to be some kind of mechanism to verify, to do it in an orderly manner. And therefore it depends on the two sides to come together and talk,&quot; he said, suggesting that an existing joint border committee would be the appropriate place to plan a coordinated pullback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UN court draws DMZ for Thai, Cambodia troops |last=Max |first=Arthur |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/news/2011/07/un-court-draws-dmz-thai-cambodia-troops | agency=AP |newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner |date=July 18, 2011 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings at the International Court of Justice==
[[File:Provisional demilitarised zone - icj - 18 july 2011 - 001.jpg|Provisional demilitarized zone pursuant to the Order of 18 July 2011|300px|right|thumb]]

On 28 April 2011 Cambodia filed a request for interpretation of the 1962 judgment, as well as a request for the indication of [[Provisional measure of protection|provisional measures]], in the Registry of the [[International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Docket&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/17704.pdf|format=PDF|title=Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) ''(Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits'', para 1|publisher=Icj-cij.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2011 the court rejected Thailand's attempt to have the case dismissed and indicated provisional measures requiring both states to withdraw their soldiers from a &quot;provisional demilitarized zone&quot; containing the area in dispute and some of its environs, continue their co-operation with ASEAN and observers appointed by it, and refrain from doing anything that might &quot;aggravate or extend the dispute&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Request for 
Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning'' the Temple  of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) ''(Cambodia v. Thailand), Provisional Measures, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (II)'', pp. 555-556, para. 69, points B.1, B.3 and B.4 of the 
operative part.[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/16564.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It also ordered Thailand not to obstruct Cambodia's access to the Temple of Preah Vihear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/16564.pdf ''Request for  Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning'' the Temple  of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) ''(Cambodia v. Thailand), Provisional Measures, I.C.J. Reports 2011 (II)'', pp. 555-556, para. 69, point B.2 of the  operative part.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 2013 the International Court of Justice gave judgment, ruling that the 1962 judgment awarded all of the [[promontory]] to Cambodia and ordering the withdrawal of Thai soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;''Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning'' the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) ''(Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits'', para 108, point 2 of the operative part.[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/17704.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a tense buildup to the decision in which dozens of Thai schools had closed ahead of the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2013/11/un-rule-thai-cambodian-border-row-201311116485209849.html |title=UN rules for Cambodia in Thai border row - Asia-Pacific |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court first concluded that it had jurisdiction and the request for interpretation was admissible, finding that a &quot;dispute exists between the Parties as to the meaning and scope of the 1962 judgment pursuant to Article 60 of the Statute [of the ICJ].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning'' the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) ''(Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits'', para 57.[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/17704.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The court said that the 1962 judgment had three important features:&lt;ref name=&quot;icj-cij1962&quot;&gt;''Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning'' the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) ''(Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits'', para 76.[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/17704.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; it involved an issue of &quot;territorial sovereignty...and that it was not engaged in delimiting the frontier&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;icj-cij1962&quot;/&gt; the &quot;Annex I map played a central role in the reasoning of the Court...&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;''Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning'' the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) ''(Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits'', para 77.[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/17704.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and that it made clear that it was only dealing with the small area in the &quot;region of the Temple of Preah Vihear&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning'' the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) ''(Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits'', para 78.[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/17704.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The court unanimously declared:&lt;ref&gt;''Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning'' the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) ''(Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits'', para 107.[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/17704.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Court therefore concludes that the first operative paragraph of the 1962 Judgment determined that Cambodia had sovereignty over the whole territory of the promontory of Preah Vihear, as defined in paragraph 98 of the present Judgment, and that, in consequence, the second operative paragraph required Thailand to withdraw from that territory the Thai military or police forces, or other guards or keepers, that were stationed there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the court rejected Cambodia's argument that Phnom Trap had also been awarded to it by the 1962 judgment, concluding that the reference to the &quot;vicinity&quot; of the Temple of Preah Vihear in the operative part of the 1962 judgment was not intended to extend to it. Phnom Trap, known by Thais as Phu Ma-khuea (ภูมะเขือ, &quot;[[Solanum]] Hill&quot;), is the hill three kilometers northwest of the temple and comprises over 4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the &quot;4.6 square km&quot; that both states agreed was in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;''Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning'' the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) ''(Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits'', para 92.[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/17704.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the verdict, hundreds of Thai villagers left the area in expectation of the ruling to be unfavorable to them. There were also fears of renewed clashes amid rising nationalist rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sattar |first=Maher |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/ruling-doesn-quell-thai-cambodia-border-row-2013111312207531747.html |title=Ruling doesn't quell Thai-Cambodia border row - Features |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civilian effects ==
After the initial attack on 4 February 2011, the Cambodian army fired [[BM-21 Grad]] rockets into the town of Sao Thong Chai about {{convert|5|km}} from the border.
