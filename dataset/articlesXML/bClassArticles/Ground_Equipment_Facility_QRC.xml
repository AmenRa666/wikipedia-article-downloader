The FAA facility and the larger area of the former [[:Category:Stations of the United States Air Force|Air Force Station]] are part of [[Ricketts Glen State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |title=Ricketts Glen State Park Official map http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/parks/rickettsglen/rickettsglen_mini.pdf |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 648th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated on 30 April 1948 at [[Watertown Air Force Station#History|Pine Camp, New York (which became operational June 1950]] as the [[655th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron|655th AC&amp;WS's]] [[Lashup Radar Network|Lashup station L-6]].&lt;!--Winkler--&gt;  The 648th AC&amp;WS transferred in December 1949 to [[Fort Indiantown Gap|Indiantown Gap Army Installation (AIN)]] and {{c.|1 January 1951}} began operations at the initial site with a General Electric AN/CPS-6B radar scanner.{{r|Radomes}} Site construction on {{convert|98|acre|adj=on}} had begun in 1950 and was completed September 21, 1951.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}  On September 21, 1951, the last of the 658th personnel arrived at the site from Fort Indiantown Gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rowland |first=Chuck |date=c. 1956 |title=26th Air Division yearbook |url=http://www.radomes.org/museum/showpicture.php?name=data/newsletters/648th-1.jpg |location=image of page at Radomes.org |accessdate=2014-04-19 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The radar and operations moved to Ricketts Glen State Park, Pennsylvania, by 1 February 1952.{{r|Johnson}}

===Benton Air Force Station===
On 1 December 1953, the radar station at Ricketts Glen State Park was designated '''Benton Air Force Station'''{{r|Johnson}} which initially provided tracking data to a [[Manual Air Defense Control Center]], e.g., on August 15, 1958, the 26th Air Division/[[Syracuse Air Defense Sector]]'s &quot;Combat Alert Center (Manual)&quot; at [[Roslyn AFS]] began using Benton data for manual [[Ground-controlled interception|GCI]].  But in less than two months, the &quot;manual division&quot; headquarters at [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport|Hancock Field]]/[[Syracuse AFS]] was eliminated&lt;!--NORAD1958B p. 16--&gt;--&quot;the 26th was moved out of Roslyn and established at Syracuse as a [computerized] SAGE division on 1 September&quot; 1958.  But [the Syracuse DC with [[AN/FSQ-7]]] did not become operational until 1 January 1959&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NORAD Historical Summary |version=1958b}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[cf.]] the Office of Civil Defense and Mobilization warning center at [[Stewart AFB]]—1 of 3 for national civil defense—was moved to Syracuse and redesignated the &quot;OCDM 26th [[National Warning System|Warning Center]]&quot; on 1 July 1959).  On 1 July 1959, concurrent with the discontinuance of Eastern NORAD Region, the warning center was moved from Stewart AFB, New York, to Syracuse, New York, and redesignated the OCDM 26th Warning Center.''&quot;  Benton's data was initially entered in the &quot;Manual Inputs&quot; terminals of the Syracuse's [[Air Defense Direction Center|SAGE Direction Center]].

A [[Burroughs AN/FST-2 Coordinate Data Transmitting Set]] was installed early in 1960{{r|Klinot}} to transmit data to the Syracuse DC{{r|Radomes}} and the May 1960 [[Highlands Army Air Defense Site|Highlands AADS]] ([[Project Nike|Nike]] [[Missile Master]]).  One of the 1st 4 Sperry AN/FPS-35 Frequency Diversity Radars&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radomes.org/museum/savethe35.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Site 3) became operational at Benton in 1961{{r|Winkler}}—the radar was {{Convert|70|ST|t LT|abbr=on}} with a red/white [[checkerboard]] pattern.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}  A new [[Ground Air Transmit Receive|GATR annex]] (R-[[tbd]]) was completed &quot;about {{convert|4|mi|km}} from the main site as part of the SAGE modernization&quot;{{r|Klinot}} (u,e,m after the 1st GATR was completed in April 1961), and Benton AFS was assigned to the [[Boston Air Defense Sector]] (Stewart AFB DC) on September 4, 1963.  A &quot;Two Row Angular Contact Ball&quot; bearing that had been &quot;procured as a spare for the Lincoln Labs CCM-Mark I Radar was installed in the AN/FPS-35 at Benton&quot; and failed at 25,000 hours.&lt;ref name=RADC&gt;{{Cite report |last1=Scheiderich |first1=Jerome P |last2=Bocchi |first2=William J |date=April 1971 |title=Bearing Improvement Program for Large Rolling Element Bearings |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/891286.pdf |format=Technical Report RADC-TR-71-81 |number=AD891286 |accessdate=2014-04-21 |quote=The work reported herein was accomplished under System 416L daring the time period from 1959 to 1964 and under Job Order No. 911+20000 from 196k to 1969.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;In 1963 the search radar was complemented by Avco AN/FPS-26A and an GE AN/FPS-6&quot; to perform SAGE height finding requests.{{r|Winkler}}

====FAA, NUDETS, and missile tracking operations====
By the end of 1963 Benton AFS was a joint-use site for both the USAF and FAA{{r|Winkler}} (by 1967, it was providing [[air traffic control|tracks to the &quot;traffic control]] facility in New York&quot;.{{r|Klinot}}{{Where|date=April 2014}}  A February 5, 1962 contract for a prototype nuclear detection system established sensors at the Benton, [[Bedford Air Force Station|Bedford (Virginia)]], and [[Temperanceville, Virginia#History|Temperanceville (Virginia)]] stations&lt;ref&gt;NORAD/CONAD 1962 Historical Summary Jan-Jun p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1st phase of the NUDETS &quot;became operational on 1 July 1964 [and] consisted of a regional data processing center at Benton AFS, Pa., and sensors located at Benton, [[Thomas, West Virginia]], [[Manassas Air Force Station]], and Hermanville, Maryland&quot; (RP-54A/Z-227A, {{Coord|38|13|40|N|076|24|33|W|name=RP-54A|display=inline}}).&lt;ref&gt;Cite NORAD Historical Summary p. 64 &quot;Phase I became operational on 1 July 1964 in the Washington, D.C. area to serve the needs of the National Military Command System. … The deployment plan was first called Deuces Wild but was changed to Thirsty Camel in October 1965 when it was thought to have been compromised.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Benton's FPS-35 was modified and &quot;tested during the summer of 1962&quot; to track [[Cape Canaveral]] missile launches (&quot;marginal ability&quot;), and Benton AFS had [[Backup Interceptor Control]]&lt;!--&quot;A-9&quot; appendix code in Winkler--&gt; capability by December 1962{{r|Winkler}}([[General Electric AN/GPA-37 Course Directing Group]]).  An [[AN/FPS-8]] backup search radar owned/operated by the FAA was in place by September 1967, when new &quot;AN/GPA-98, ECM training simulator, and [[AN/FYQ-48]], the new digital data processor which replaces the AN/FST-2&quot; were planned.{{r|Klinot}}  Before 1974 when the AN/FPS-35 was replaced, [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] direction-finding equipment was used{{r|Klinot}} after the radar &quot;scopes would light up like light bulbs&quot; almost every morning for a half-hour{{r|Bartizek}}—a noisy [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] TV tuner in the area was located which was being used for a &quot;soap opera on one of the local channels&quot;.{{r|Bartizek}}

===Formerly used defense site===
After [[Project Concise]] [[Base Realignment and Closure|Air Defense closures were announced]] on November 22, 1974; the radar facility of Benton AFS transferred to the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] on June 30, 1975{{r|Johnson}} (the squadron was also inactivated on that date.){{r|Johnson}} as an auxiliary radar for [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport]]{{Citation needed|reason=The info with the term &quot;auxiliary&quot; is in one of the references.|date=April 2014}}—other buildings and barracks transferred to the [[Red Rock Job Corps Center]]{{r|Radomes}} in 1978.{{r|Bartizek}}  In 1995, Benton was the backup air traffic control radar when the airport near Avoca needed data.&lt;ref&gt; http://archives.timesleader.com/1995/1995_15/1995_10_28_RADAR_NOT_USED_FOR_SOME_LANDINGS_THE_SYSTEM_AT_THE_AREA_S_INTERN.html &lt;/ref&gt;  After 2001 the FAA site became part of the [[Joint Surveillance System]], and the &quot;FPS-67B, now Common [[Air Route Surveillance Radar|Air-Route Surveillance Radar]] (CARSR)&quot;{{r|Radomes}} was used in a 2004 FAA test.&lt;ref&gt; http://llwebprod2.ll.mit.edu/publications/journal/pdf/vol16_no1/16_1_6Thompson.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, a new maintenance contract was issued for the &quot;Qrc Arsr Hvac Pwr Project&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; government-contracts.findthebest.com/l/1155154/Btn-Construction-Incorporated-Federal-Aviation-Administration-DTFAEN13C00399 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Assigments===
Benton AFS and its USAF squadron were assigned to several larger units of [[Air Defense Command]] ([[Aerospace Defense Command]] after 1968),{{r|Johnson}} but after data transmission was automated in 1960, its radar tracks were provided to more than one Direction Center (e.g., &quot;three air divisions simultaneously - [[35th Air Division|35th]], [[21st Air Division|21st]], and [[34th Air Division]]s&quot; in September 1967):
* [[503d Aircraft Control and Warning Group]], 1 January 1951
* [[26th Air Division]], 6 February 1952
* [[4710th Defense Wing]], 10 February 1953
* [[4709th Defense Wing]], 30 June 1953
* [[4707th Air Defense Wing]], 8 July 1956
* [[4622d Air Defense Wing]], 18 October 1956
* Boston Air Defense Sector, 8 January 1957
* Syracuse Air Defense Sector, 15 August 1958
* Boston Air Defense Sector, 4 September 1963
* 35th Air Division, 1 April 1966
* 21st Air Division, 19 November 1969 – 30 June 1975
