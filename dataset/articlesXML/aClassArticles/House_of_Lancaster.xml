The '''House of Lancaster''' was the name of two [[cadet branch|cadet branches]] of the royal [[House of Plantagenet]]. The first house was created when [[Henry III of England]] created the [[Earl of Lancaster|Earldom of Lancaster]]{{mdash}}from which the house was named{{mdash}}for his second son [[Edmund Crouchback]] in 1267. Edmund had already been created [[Earl of Leicester]] in 1265 and was granted the lands and privileges of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], after de Montfort's death and [[attainder]] at the end of the [[Second Barons' War]].&lt;ref name=Weir2008&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Edmund's son [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], inherited his father-in-law's estates and title of [[Earl of Lincoln]] he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England, with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels.&lt;ref name=Jones2012p371&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought him{{mdash}}and [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster|Henry]], his younger brother{{mdash}}into conflict with their cousin [[Edward II of England]], leading to Thomas's execution. Henry inherited Thomas's titles and he and his son, who was also called [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry]], gave loyal service to Edward's son{{mdash}}[[Edward III of England]].

The second house of Lancaster was descended from [[John of Gaunt]], who married the heiress of the first house. Edward III married all his sons to wealthy English heiresses rather than following his predecessors' practice of finding continental political marriages for royal princes. [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], had no male heir so Edward married his son John to Henry's heiress daughter and John's third cousin [[Blanche of Lancaster]]. This gave John the vast wealth of the House of Lancaster. Their son [[Henry IV of England|Henry]] usurped the throne in 1399, creating one of the factions in the [[Wars of the Roses]]. There was an intermittent dynastic struggle between the descendants of Edward III. In these wars, the term Lancastrian became a reference to members of the family and their supporters. The family provided England with three kings: [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], who ruled from 1399 to 1413, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] (1413–1422), and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] (1422–1461 and 1470–1471).

The House became extinct in the male line upon the murder in the [[Tower of London]] of Henry VI, following the battlefield execution of his son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]], by supporters of the [[House of York]] in 1471. Lancastrian [[Cognatic kinship|cognatic descent]]{{mdash}}from John of Gaunt and Blanche of Lancaster's daughter [[Philippa of Lancaster|Phillipa]]{{mdash}}continued in the royal houses of Spain and Portugal while the Lancastrian political cause was maintained by [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]]{{mdash}}a relatively unknown scion of the [[House of Beaufort|Beauforts]]{{mdash}}eventually leading to the establishment of the [[House of Tudor]]. The Lancastrians left a legacy through the patronage of the arts{{mdash}}most notably in founding [[Eton College]] and [[King's College, Cambridge]]{{mdash}}but to historians’ chagrin their propaganda, and that of their Tudor successors, means that it is Shakespeare’s partly fictionalized history plays rather than medievalist scholarly research that has the greater influence on modern perceptions of the dynasty.&lt;ref name=Galbraith&gt;{{harvnb|Galbraith|1982|pp=223–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the Earls of Lancaster==

After the supporters of [[Henry III of England]] suppressed opposition from the English nobility in the [[Second Barons' War]], Henry granted to his second son [[Edmund Crouchback]] the titles and possessions forfeited by [[attainder]] of the barons' leader, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], including the [[Earl of Leicester|Earldom of Leicester]], on 26 October 1265. Later grants included the first [[Earl of Lancaster|Earldom of Lancaster]] on 30 June 1267 and that of [[Earl Ferrers]] in 1301. Edmund was also [[Count of Champagne]] and Brie from 1276 by right of his wife.&lt;ref name=Weir2008&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry IV of England]] would later use his descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne, even making the spurious claim that Edmund was the elder son of Henry but had been passed over as king because of his deformity.&lt;ref name=Weir1995&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edmond1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seal (emblem)|Seal]] of Edmund Crouchback]] Edmund's second marriage to [[Blanche of Artois]], the widow of [[Henry I of Navarre|the King of Navarre]], placed him at the centre of the European aristocracy. Blanche's daughter [[Joan I of Navarre]] was queen regnant of Navarre and through her marriage to [[Philip IV of France]] was queen consort of France. Edmund's son [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas]] became the most powerful nobleman in England, gaining the Earldoms of [[Earl of Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[Earl of Salisbury|Salisbury]] through marriage to the heiress of [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln]]. His income was £11,000 per annum{{mdash}}double that of the next wealthiest earl.&lt;ref name=Jones2012p371&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas and his younger brother [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster|Henry]] served in the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of their cousin King [[Edward II of England]] on 25 February 1308; Thomas carried Curtana, the [[Sword of Mercy]], and Henry carried the royal sceptre.&lt;ref name=Jones2012p363&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially supporting Edward, Thomas became one of the [[Lords Ordainers]], who demanded the banishment of [[Piers Gaveston]] and the governance of the realm by a baronial council. After Gaveston was captured, Thomas took the lead in his trial and execution at Warwick in 1312.&lt;ref name=Jones2012p375&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=375–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's authority was weakened by poor governance and defeat by the Scots at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]]. This allowed Thomas to restrain Edward's power by republishing the [[Ordinances of 1311]]. Following this achievement Thomas took little part in the governance of the realm and instead retreated to [[Pontefract Castle]].&lt;ref name=Jones2012p390&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Edward to regroup and re-arm, leading to a fragile peace in August 1318 with the [[Treaty of Leake]]. In 1321 Edward's rule again collapsed into civil war. Thomas raised a northern army but was defeated and captured at the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]]. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered but because he was Edward's cousin he was given a quicker death by beheading.&lt;ref name=Jones2012p400&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry joined the revolt of Edward's wife [[Isabella of France]] and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Mortimer]] in 1326, pursuing and capturing Edward at [[Neath]] in South Wales.&lt;ref name=Jones2012p400&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Edward's deposition at the Parliament of Kenilworth in 1326 and reputed murder at [[Berkeley Castle]],&lt;ref name=Davies1999&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas's conviction was posthumously reversed and Henry regained possession of the Earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, Salisbury and Lincoln that had been forfeit for Thomas's treason. His restored prestige led to him knighting the young King [[Edward III of England]] before his coronation.&lt;ref name=Jones2012p422&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer lost support over the [[Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton]] that formalised Scotland's independence, and his developing power in the [[Welsh Marches]] provoked jealousy from the barons. When Mortimer called a parliament to make his new powers and estates permanent with the title of [[Earl of March]] in 1328, Henry led the opposition and held a counter-meeting. In response, Mortimer ravaged the lands of Lancaster and checked the revolt. Edward III was able to assume control in 1330 but Henry's further influence was restricted by poor health and blindness for the last fifteen years of his life.&lt;ref name=Waugh&gt;{{harvnb|Waugh|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee1997p115&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duchy and Palatinate of Lancaster==
{{See also|County palatine }}
{{House of Lancaster||Royal Arms of England (1399-1603).svg}}
Henry's son, also called [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry]], was born at the castle of [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire|Grosmont]] in [[Monmouthshire]] between 1299 and 1314.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir2008p77&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the younger Henry's memoirs, he was better at [[Historical European martial arts|martial arts]] than academic subjects and did not learn to read until later in life.&lt;ref name=fowler26&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was coeval with Edward III and was pivotal to his reign, becoming his best friend and most trusted commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones2012p471b&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was knighted in 1330, represented his father in [[Parliament of England|parliament]] and fought in Edward's Scottish campaign.&lt;ref name=fowler30&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of the [[Hundred Years' War]], Henry took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great English victory in the naval [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340.&lt;ref name=fowler34&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he was required to commit himself as hostage in the [[Low Countries]] for Edward’s considerable debts. He remained hostage for a year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release.&lt;ref name=fowler35&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=35–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1345, Edward III launched a major, three-pronged attack on France. The [[William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]] attacked from [[Brittany]], Edward from [[Flanders]], and Henry from [[Aquitaine]] in the south.&lt;ref name=Jones2012p471b&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving rapidly through the country, Henry confronted the [[Bertrand I, 1st Comte de l'Isle|Comte d'Isle]] at the [[Battle of Auberoche]] and achieved a victory described as &quot;the greatest single achievement of Lancaster's entire military career&quot;.&lt;ref name=fowler58&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=58–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ransom from the prisoners has been estimated at £50,000.&lt;ref name=fowler61&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward rewarded Henry by including him as a founding knight of the [[Order of the Garter]].&lt;ref name=McKisack&gt;{{harvnb|McKisack|1959|pp=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; An even greater honour was bestowed on Lancaster when Edward created him [[Duke of Lancaster]]. The title of duke was relatively new in England, with only Cornwall being a previous ducal title. Lancaster was also given [[County palatine|palatinate]] status for the county of [[Lancashire]], which entailed a separate administration independent of the crown.&lt;ref name=fowler173&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=173–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two other counties palatine; [[County Durham|Durham]] was an ancient ecclesiastical palatinate and [[Chester]] was crown property.

In 1350, Henry was present at the naval victory at [[Battle of Les Espagnols sur Mer|Winchelsea]], where he saved the life of the [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]].&lt;ref name=fowler193&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=193–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent 1351-2 on [[Northern Crusades|crusade]] in [[Old Prussians|Prussia]] where a quarrel with [[Otto the Mild, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Otto, Duke of Brunswick]], almost led to a duel between the two men, which was only averted by the intervention of  [[John II of France]].&lt;ref name=fowler106&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=106–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As campaigning in France resumed, Henry participated in the last great offensive of the [[Rheims]] campaign of 1359–60{{mdash}}the first phase of the Hundred Years' War{{mdash}}before returning to England where he fell ill and died, most likely of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]], at [[Leicester Castle]].&lt;ref name=fowler217&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=217–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward III of England married [[John of Gaunt]], his third surviving son, to Henry's heiress [[Blanche of Lancaster]]. On Henry's death, Edward conferred on Gaunt the second creation of the title of Duke of Lancaster, which made Gaunt, after Edward, the wealthiest landowner in England. Gaunt enjoyed great political influence during his lifetime, but upon his death in 1399 his lands were confiscated by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].  Gaunt's exiled son and heir Henry of Bolingbroke returned home and gathered military support in clear contravention of Richard's [[Treason Act 1397|treason act of 1397]], which included a definition of treason  of &quot;or [to] ... raiseth People and rideth against the King to make War within his Realm ...&quot;. Although he claimed his aim was restoration of his Lancaster inheritance, this Act and Henry's knowledge of Richard's character{{mdash}}suspicious and vindictive{{mdash}}probably meant Henry knew that only by removing Richard from power could he be secure.&lt;ref name=Brown2010&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|Summerson|2010|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry unified popular opposition to Richard II, took control of the kingdom and Richard{{mdash}}recognising that he had insufficient support to resist{{mdash}}surrendered to Henry’s forces at [[Conwy Castle]]. Henry instigated a commission to decide who should be king. Richard was forced to abdicate and although Henry was not next in line, he was chosen by an unlawfully constituted parliament dominated by his supporters.&lt;ref name=Weir1995p36&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=36–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first unrest of his reign and a revolt by the Earls of Salisbury, Gloucester, Exeter and Surrey, Richard reputedly starved to death.&lt;ref name=Saul1995&gt;{{harvnb|Saul|1997|pp=424–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate as to whether this was self-inflicted or ordered by Henry to end the risk of restoration without leaving incriminating marks on the body.&lt;ref name=Tuck2004&gt;{{harvnb|Tuck|2004|pp=209–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign of Henry IV==

There is much debate amongst historians about Henry's accession, in part because some see it as a cause of the Wars of the Roses. For many historians, the accession by force of the throne broke principles the Plantagenets had established successfully over two and a half centuries and allowed any magnate with sufficient power and Plantagenet blood to have ambitions to assume the throne. Richard had attempted to disinherit Henry and remove him from the succession. In response Henry’s legal advisors, led by [[William Thirning]], dissuaded Henry from claiming the throne by right of conquest and instead look for legal justification.&lt;ref name=Mortimer2012p297&gt;{{harvnb|Mortimer|2012|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Henry established a committee to investigate his assertion that his mother had legitimate rights through descent from Edmund Crouchback, whom he said was the elder son of Henry III of England but was set aside because of deformity, no evidence was found. The eight-year-old [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March]], was the [[heir general]] to Richard II by being the grandson of Edward III's second son, [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], and also the son of Richard's last nominated heir. In desperation, Henry's advisors made the case that Henry was [[heir male]] to Henry III and this was supported by thirteenth-century entails.&lt;ref name=Mortimer2012p298&gt;{{harvnb|Mortimer|2012|pp=298–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer's sister [[Anne de Mortimer]] married [[Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge]], son of Edward III's fourth son [[Edmund of Langley]], consolidating Anne's place in the succession with that of the more junior [[House of York]].&lt;ref name=Weir1995p235&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child Mortimer was not considered a serious contender and as an adult he showed no interest in the throne, instead loyally serving the House of Lancaster. Mortimer informed Henry V when Conisburgh, in what was later called the [[Southampton Plot]], attempted to place him on the throne instead of Henry's newly crowned son{{mdash}}their mutual cousin{{mdash}}leading to the execution of Conisburgh and the other plotters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry IV was plagued with financial problems, the political need to reward his supporters, frequent rebellions and declining health{{mdash}}including [[leprosy]] and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swanson|1995|p=298}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Percy|Percy family]] had been some of Henry's leading supporters, defending the North from Scotland largely at their own expense, but revolted in the face of lack of reward and suspicion from Henry. [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)]] was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]]. In 1405, Hotspur's father [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], supported the [[Archbishop of York]], [[Richard le Scrope]], in another rebellion, after which the elder Percy fled to Scotland and his estates were confiscated. Henry had Scrope executed in an act comparable to the murder of another Archbishop{{mdash}}[[Thomas Beckett]] by men loyal to Henry II. This would probably have led to Henry's excommunication but the church was in the midst of the [[Western Schism]], with competing popes keen on Henry's support; it protested but took no action.&lt;ref name=Weir1995p49&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1408, Percy invaded England once more and was killed at the [[Battle of Bramham Moor]].&lt;ref name=Lee1997p138&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|pp=138–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wales, [[Owain Glyndŵr]]'s widespread rebellion was only suppressed with the recapture of [[Harlech Castle]] in 1409, although sporadic fighting continued until 1421.&lt;ref name=Davies1995p293&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1995|pp=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry IV was succeeded by his son [[Henry V of England|Henry V]],&lt;ref name=Weir2008p130&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|2008|pp=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually by his grandson [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] in 1422.&lt;ref name=Weir2008p133&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|2008|pp=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Henry V and the Hundred Years' War==

{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1415–1453)}}
[[File:Agincour.JPG|right|thumb|Henry V's victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]]]

[[Henry V of England]] was a successful and ruthless monarch.&lt;ref name=Schama2656&gt;{{harvnb|Schama|2000|pp=265–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was quick to re-assert the claim to the French throne he inherited from Edward III, continuing what was later called the Hundred Years' War. The war was not a formal, continuous conflict but a series of English raids and military expeditions from 1337 until 1453. There were six major royal expeditions; Henry himself led the fifth and sixth, but these were unlike the smaller, frequent, provincial campaigns.&lt;ref name=Davies419&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1997|pp=419–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Henry's first major campaign{{mdash}}and the fifth major royal campaign of the war{{mdash}}he invaded France, captured [[Harfleur]], made a [[chevauchée]] to [[Calais]] and won a near-total victory over the French at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] despite being outnumbered, outmanoeuvred and low on supplies.&lt;ref name=Schama265 &gt;{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second campaign, he recaptured much of Normandy and in a treaty secured a marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]]. The terms of the [[Treaty of Troyes]] were that Henry's and Catherine's heirs would succeed to the throne of France. This condition was contested by the [[Charles VII of France|Dauphin]] and the momentum of the war changed. In 1421, Henry's brother [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], was killed at the [[Battle of Baugé]], and Henry V died of dysentery at [[Vincennes]] in 1422.&lt;ref name=Weir2008p133&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|2008|pp=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HumphreyDoG&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harriss|2004|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry VI of England]] was less than a year old but his uncles{{mdash}}led by Henry V's brother [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]]{{mdash}}continued the war.&lt;ref name=Johndob&gt;{{harvnb|Stratford|2004|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were more victories, including the [[Battle of Verneuil]], but it was impossible to maintain campaigning at this level. [[Joan of Arc]]'s involvement helped the French remove the siege of Orleans&lt;ref name=Davies76&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1999|pp=76–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; and win the [[Battle of Patay]] before Joan was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, tried as a witch and burned at the stake. The Dauphin was crowned and continued the successful [[Fabian tactics]] of avoiding full frontal assault and exploiting logistical advantage.&lt;ref name=Weir1995p82&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=82–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Henry VI and the fall of the House of Lancaster==

{{main|Wars of the Roses|House of York }}
{{see also|List of members of the House of Plantagenet|Issue of Edward III of England}}

The Hundred Years' War caused political division between the Lancastrians and the other Plantagenets during the minority of Henry VI: Bedford wanted to maintain the majority of the Lancastrian’s French possessions; [[Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester]] wanted to hold only Calais; and [[Cardinal Beaufort]] desired a negotiated peace.&lt;ref name=HumphreyDoG&gt;{{harvnb|Harriss|2004|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir1995p72&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=72–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloucester's attacks on Beaufort forced the latter from public life but brought him little advantage as the earl of Suffolk’s influence over the king enabled him to direct policy for the rest of the decade. Gloucester remained heir presumptive but in 1441 his ambitious wife, [[Eleanor Cobham]], consulted astrologers on the likelihood of the king's death and was arrested for treasonable necromancy{{mdash}}although  Gloucester was not implicated he was discredited forced into retirement. In 1447 Suffolk had him arrested and within days he died in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;HumphreyDoG&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harriss|2004|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England's ally [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy]] defected to Charles, when the English ambassadors' refusal to renounce the claim to the French crown stalled negotiations, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)]].&lt;ref name=Weir1995p86&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=86,101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French reorganised the superior numbers of their feudal levies into a modern professional army and retook Paris, Rouen, Bordeaux and Normandy. Victories at the [[Battle of Formigny]] in 1450 and  the [[Battle of Castillon]] in 1453 brought the war to an end with the House of Lancaster losing forever all its French holdings, except Calais and the Channel Islands.&lt;ref name=Weir1995p156&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir1995p172&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry VI proved to be a weak king and vulnerable to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontations, such as the [[Percy–Neville feud]].&lt;ref name=Schama266&gt;{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the common purpose of the war in France, Henry's cousin [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York]], and [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], used their networks to defy the crown.&lt;ref name=Castor&gt;{{harvnb|Castor|2000|pp=3–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry became the focus of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the [[Great Slump (15th century)|Great Slump]].&lt;ref name=Hicks44&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|2010|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, [[Jack Cade]] raised a rebellion to force Henry to address the economic problems or abdicate his throne.&lt;ref name=Weir147&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=147–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the yeoman brothers [[John and William Merfold]].&lt;ref name=Mate156&gt;{{harvnb|Mate|2006|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Choosing the Red and White Roses.jpg|right|thumb|Symbolic representation of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in art]]

Henry's marriage to [[Margaret of Anjou]] prompted criticism from [[Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York]], because it included the surrender of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and an extended truce with France. York was Henry's cousin through his descent from Edward III sons Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Edmund, Duke of York. This gave York political influence but he was removed from English and French politics through his appointment as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;croftonrichduke&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Crofton|2007|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to England, York was conscious of the fate of Henry's uncle Humphrey at the hands of the Beauforts and suspicious that Henry intended to nominate [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset]], as heir presumptive, and recruited military forces. Armed conflict was avoided because York lacked aristocratic support and was forced to swear allegiance to Henry. However, when Henry later underwent a mental breakdown, York was named regent. Henry was trusting and not a man of war, but Margaret was more assertive and showed open enmity towards York{{mdash}}particularly after the birth of a male heir that resolved the succession question and assured her position.&lt;ref name=&quot;croftonrichdukeeleven&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Crofton|2007|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Robin Storey, &quot;If Henry's insanity was a tragedy; his recovery was a national disaster&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;storey&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Storey|1986|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Henry's sanity returned, the court party reasserted its authority but York and his relatives, the Nevilles, defeated them at the [[First Battle of St Albans]]. Historian [[Anthony Goodman (historian)|Anthony Goodman]] suggests that around 50 men were killed; among them were Somerset and two Percy lords, [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford]], creating feuds that would confound reconciliation attempts despite the shock to the ruling class caused by the armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threatened with treason charges and lacking support, York, [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, fled abroad. Henry was captured by the opposition when the Nevilles returned and won the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; York joined them, surprising parliament by claiming the throne and then forcing through the [[Act of Accord]] stating that Henry would remain as monarch for his lifetime and that York would succeed him. The disinheriting of [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Henry's son Edward]] was unacceptable to Margaret so the conflict continued. York was killed at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] and his head was displayed at [[Micklegate Bar]], York, along with those of [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], and Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury{{mdash}}both of whom were captured and beheaded.&lt;ref name=Weir257&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret gained the support of the Scottish queen [[Mary of Guelders]], and with a Scottish army she pillaged into southern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The citizens of London feared the city being plundered and enthusiastically welcomed York's son [[Edward IV of England|Edward, Earl of March]].&lt;ref name=&quot;crowned&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret's defeat at the [[Battle of Towton]] confirmed Edward's position and he was crowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Disaffected with Edward's marriage to [[Elizabeth Woodville]] and preferment of her formerly Lancastrian-supporting family, Warwick and Clarence defected to the Lancastrians.  The alliance was sealed with the marriage of Henry's son Edward to Anne, Warwick's daughter. Edward and [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], fled England. When they returned, Clarence switched sides at the [[Battle of Barnet]] and Warwick and his brother were killed. Henry, Margaret and Edward of Lancaster were caught at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] before they could escape back to France.  Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, was executed on the battlefield and [[John Beaufort, Marquess of Dorset]], was killed in the fighting{{mdash}}meaning that when his brother [[Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset]], was executed two days later, the Beaufort family became extinct in the legitimate male line. The captive Henry was murdered on 21 May 1471 in the [[Tower of London]] and buried in [[Chertsey Abbey]], extinguishing the House of Lancaster.&lt;ref name=End&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespeare’s history plays===

{{Quote box|align=right|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;This royal throne of kings, this sceptr’d isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war,
This happy breed of men, this little world,
This precious stone set in the silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house
Against the envy of less happier lands;
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England...
&lt;/poem&gt;
|source=—John of Gaunt’s speech in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', &lt;br&gt;Act II, Scene I, 40–50&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|1999|p=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

It is a source of irritation to historians that Shakespeare’s influence on the perception of the later medieval period exceeds that of academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|1999|p=506}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the chronology of Shakespeare's [[Shakespearean history|history plays]] runs from [[King John (play)|King John]] to [[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]], they are dominated by eight plays in which members of the House of Lancaster play a significant part,  voicing speeches on a par with those in [[Hamlet]] and [[King Lear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|1999|p=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plays are:
*''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''
*''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]''
*''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]''
*''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''
*''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]''
*''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]''
*''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]''
*''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.

According to the historian [[Norman Davies]], the plays were constrained by the political and religious requirements of Tudor England. While they are factually inaccurate, they demonstrate how the past and the House of Lancaster are remembered in terms of myth, legend, ideas and popular misconceptions. Shakespeare avoided contentious political and religious issues to dubiously illustrate Tudor England as having rejected medieval conflict and entered an era of harmony and prosperity. The famous patriotic &quot;sceptr'd isle&quot; speech is voiced by John of Gaunt, a man who spent the majority of his life in Aquitaine, and is a piece of poetic licence that illustrates English prejudices. ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' is one-sided with little sympathy for the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|1999|p=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these historical lines illustrate historical myth rather than realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Belsey|1992|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Succession===

Lancastrian [[Cognatic kinship|cognatic descent]] from John of Gaunt and Blanche's daughter Phillipa continued in the royal houses of Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=Phillipa&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of the Lancastrian court party coalesced support around [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]]{{mdash}}a relatively unknown scion of the [[Beaufort family|Beauforts]]. They had been amongst the most ardent supporters of the House of Lancaster and were descended illegitimately from John of Gaunt by his mistress [[Katherine Swynford]]. Although later legitimised by Richard II, Henry IV had formally and permanently debarred them from the succession to avoid competition with the House of Lancaster’s claims to the throne. By some calculations of primogeniture, there were as many as 18 people{{mdash}}including both his mother and future wife{{mdash}}with more right to the throne. By 1510, this figure had increased with the birth of an additional 16 possible Yorkist claimants.&lt;ref name=Tudor148&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the House of Lancaster extinct, Henry claimed to be the Lancastrian heir through his mother [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]]. His father was Henry VI's maternal half-brother. In 1485, Henry Tudor united increasing opposition within England to the reign of [[King Richard III of England|Richard III]] with the Lancastrian cause to take the throne. To legitimise his questionable claim, Henry married [[Elizabeth of York]]{{mdash}}Edward IV of England's daughter{{mdash}}and promoted the [[House of Tudor]] as a dynasty of dual Lancastrian and Yorkist descent.&lt;ref name=Tudor&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|2008|pp=146–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion, education and the arts===
[[File:Cambridge King's College Chapel 2011 03.jpg|right|thumb|[[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]]]

The Lancastrians were both pious and well read. Henry IV was the first English king known to have possessed a vernacular Bible, supported the canonization of [[John Twenge]], gave a pension to the anchoress Margaret Pensax and maintained close relations with several Westminster recluses. His household accounts as king record conventional payments to large numbers of paupers (12,000 on Easter day 1406) and the intercession for him of twenty-four oratores domini regis at 2d each per day. However, his reliance on the church was both personal and political. [[Thomas Arundel|Archbishop Arundel]] gave the Lancastrians vital support and carried other bishops with him. In return the church required support for religious orthodoxy against heresy. [[Lollards]] were suppressed and heresy was made a capital offence in England under the statute of [[De haeretico comburendo]] even though Henry could not afford to overly antagonize his supporters with Lollard sympathies, including those among his Lancastrian retainers.&lt;ref name=Brown2010&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|Summerson|2010|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the author of the Gesta Henrici quinti, Henry V aimed ‘to promote the honour of God, the extension of the Church, the deliverance of his country and the peace and tranquillity of kingdoms’. He was deeply religious, engaged with ecclesiastical issues and saw that his role as king was to honour God, extend the church, fight heresy and defend the established social order. All his victories, especially Agincourt, were attributed to divine intervention. Henry V founded [[Syon Abbey]] in 1415, as penance for his father’s execution of Archbishop Scrope, and three monasteries in London: for [[Carthusian]], [[Bridgettine]] and [[Celestines|Celestine]] orders.&lt;ref name=H5&gt;{{harvnb|Allmand|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equally devout Henry VI continued the architectural patronage begun by his father, founding [[Eton College]] and [[King's College, Cambridge]] and leaving a lasting educational and architectural legacy in buildings including [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College Chapel]] and [[Eton College Chapel]].&lt;ref name=Eton&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lancastrian regime was founded and legitimised by formal lying that was both public and official. This has been described as &quot;a series of unconstitutional actions&quot; based &quot;upon three major acts of perjury&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sherbourne&gt;{{harvnb|Sherborne|1994|pp=218,239}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[K.B. McFarlane]] found it hard &quot;to think of another moment of comparable importance in medieval English political history when the supply of information was so effectively manipulated as it was by Henry IV on this occasion&quot;.&lt;ref name=McFarlane&gt;{{harvnb|McFarlane|1972|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lancastrians patronised poets for [[panegyric]] purposes for years before Henry IV ascended the throne, including [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] who dedicated [[The Book of the Duchess]] to Blanche of Lancaster around 1368. In 1400, poets in the pay of Henry IV were directed to [[propaganda]] purposes. [[John Gower]] based his [[Cronica Tripertita]] on the official Lancastrian accounts of the usurpation:&quot;The Record and Process of the Deposition of Richard II&quot; from 1399. Gower also produced a number of further favourable works including &quot;In praise of peace&quot; which was dedicated to Henry IV.&lt;ref name=Brewer&gt;{{harvnb|Brewer|2012|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
