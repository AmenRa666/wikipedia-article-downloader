The '''Walls of Dubrovnik''' ({{lang-hr|Dubrovačke gradske zidine}}) are a series of [[defensive wall|defensive stone walls]] that have surrounded and protected the citizens of the afterward proclaimed maritime [[city-state]] of [[Dubrovnik]] ([[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]]), situated in southern [[Croatia]], since the city's founding prior to the 7th century as a [[Byzantium]] [[Castra|castrum]] on a rocky island named Laus (Ragusia or Lave).&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&quot;''...city's founding before the 7th century as a Byzantine castrum on a rocky island named Laus...''&quot; The 7th century recorded by Constantine Porphyrogenitus as city's founding was probably the last act of peoples movement to Ragusia settlement, hurried by Slavs migration into these areas.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruno Milić&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Milić | first=Bruno | pages=242–245 | title=Razvoj grada kroz stoljeća II, Srednji vijek | publisher=[[Školska knjiga]] | location=Zagreb | year=1995 | language=Croatian | isbn=953-0-31641-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; With numerous additions and modifications throughout their history, they have been considered to be amongst the great [[fortification]] systems of the [[Middle Ages]], as they were never breached by a hostile army during this time period.&lt;ref name=inyourpocket&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/croatia/dubrovnik/sightseeing/essentialdubrovnik/venue/5761-the_city_walls_bastions_and_gates_pile__ploe.html | title=The City Walls, Bastions and Gates Pile &amp; Ploče | work=Inyourpocket.com | publisher=[[In Your Pocket City Guides]] | accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the old city of Dubrovnik, which includes a substantial portion of the old walls of Dubrovnik, joined the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref name=Britannica-Dubrovnik&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dubrovnik|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/172803/Dubrovnik|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/95 | title=Old City of Dubrovnik | work=World Heritage | publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]] | accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This complex structure, amongst the largest and most complete in [[Europe]], protected the freedom and safety of a &quot;civilised&quot; and &quot;sophisticated&quot; republic that flourished in peace and prosperity for some five centuries.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&quot;''..., protected the freedom and safety of a &quot;civilised&quot; and &quot;sophisticated&quot; republic that flourished in peace and prosperity for five centuries.''&quot; This sentence refers to the time of the Republic of Ragusa from 1358 to 1808. However, walls protected the city of Dubrovnik, before and after that particular time period.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LonelyPlanet&gt;{{cite book | last=Oliver | first=Jeanne | pages=227–229 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=SXVSki2c_nwC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=walls+of+Dubrovnik&amp;q=walls%20of%20Dubrovnik | title=Croatia | edition=4th | year=2007 | publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] | isbn=978-1-74104-916-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walls were reinforced by three circular and 14 quadrangular [[tower]]s, five [[bastion]]s (bulwarks), two angular fortifications and the large St. John's Fortress. Land walls were additionally reinforced by one larger bastion  and nine smaller semicircular ones, like the [[casemate]] Fort Bokar, the oldest preserved fort of that kind in Europe.&lt;ref name=geographica&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geographica.hr/site/public/download/project_city_walls_of_dubrovnik.pdf | title=City walls of Dubrovnik | publisher=Geographica d.o.o. | format=PDF | accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[moat]] that ran around the outside section of the city walls, which were armed by more than 120 [[cannon]]s, provided superb city defense capabilities.&lt;ref name=diu&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diu.hr/en/sights/city_walls/ | title=The city walls | work=Diu.hr | publisher=Dubrovnik International University | accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former city walls==
The construction of the first [[limestone]] forts around the city began in the [[Early Middle Ages]], towards the end of the 8th century. But, the &quot;old chronicles&quot; say that some sort of castle reliably existed on the Lave peninsula quite a long time prior to that.&lt;ref name=&quot;diu&quot;/&gt; It is certain that the early town on Laus Island was also surrounded by defensive walls, probably mainly by wooden palisades.&lt;ref name=&quot;croatiatraveller&quot;/&gt; The fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long invasion by the [[Saracen]]s in the 9th century proves how well the city was fortified.&lt;ref name=&quot;LonelyPlanet&quot;/&gt;

The city first spread towards the uninhabited eastern part of the islet, which explains why the current name for the southeast part of the city, near St. John's Fortress, is called ''Pustijerna''. The name &quot;Pustijerna&quot; comes from the Latin statement &quot;post terra&quot;, which means &quot;outside the town&quot;. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the defensive wall enclosed the eastern portion of the city. When the sea channel separating the city from mainland was filled with earth in the 11th century, the city merged with the settlement on land, and soon, a single wall was built around the area of the present-day city core.&lt;ref name=sitiunescoadriatico&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sitiunescoadriatico.org/index.php?pg=2077 | title=City Walls | work=Sitiunescoadriatico.org | publisher=[[Province of Ferrara]] | accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this same time period, Dubrovnik and the surrounding area were described as a part of the [[Croats|Croatian]] (''Grwasiah'') entity, in one of the works by the famous [[Arab]] geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]].&lt;ref name=Oman&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author=G. Oman, Al-Idrīsī | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam | edition=New | volume=3 | origyear=1971 | year=1986 | pages=1032–35 | publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] | isbn=90-04-03275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Nuzhat al-Mushataq fi ikhtiraq al-afaq'' ({{lang-en|Joy for those who wish to sail over the world}}) from 1154, he mentioned Dubrovnik as the southernmost city of &quot;the country of Croatia and Dalmatia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=croatianhistory&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/et01.html | title=Croatia&amp;nbsp;– historical and cultural overview | work=Croatianhistory.net | first=Darko | last=Zubrinic | location=Zagreb  | year=1995 | accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic city plan dates from 1292, when the port was rebuilt following a fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica-Dubrovnik&quot;/&gt; The whole city was entirely enclosed in the 13th century, except for the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[monastery]], which came under its protection later on, during the 14th century.&lt;ref name=dubrovnik-guide&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dubrovnik-guide.net/walls.htm | title=Dubrovnik City walls | work=Dubrovnik-guide.net | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city walls have been preserved to the present day, not only because of the knowledge of the skilled construction workers and the constant care provided by city dwellers that maintained and rebuilt the structures as needed, but also because of the brilliantly reputed diplomacy in Ragusa, which managed on many occasions to avoid dangerous measures taken by enemies against the Republic of Ragusa.&lt;ref name=&quot;sitiunescoadriatico&quot;/&gt;

[[File:View-of-Dubrovnik.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The view from the spot where you first come out on top of the walls of Dubrovnik]]

The present shape of the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full independence from [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] suzerainty, but the peak of its construction lasted from the beginning of the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century. Being constructed very solidly, the walls were generally unaffected by a [[1667 Dubrovnik earthquake|strong earthquake occurring in 1667]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diu&quot;/&gt;
The largest stimulus for continued development and emergency repairs and works of the Ragusan fortresses came as a result of the danger of unexpected attack by [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] military forces, especially after they conquered [[Constantinople]] in 1453.&lt;ref name=JamesStewart&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | pages=285–293 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=KIhFr8klMowC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=walls+of+Dubrovnik&amp;q=walls%20of%20Dubrovnik | title=Croatia | publisher=Cadogan Guides | year=2006 | isbn=1-86011-319-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The city was also under latent danger of attack by the Venetians.&lt;ref name=&quot;diu&quot;/&gt; For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to preserve their city-republic by skillful maneuvering between [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. A strategic treaty with Turkey protracted Ragusa’s liberty and maintained the opportunity for a major trading role between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica-Dubrovnik&quot;/&gt;

The irregular parallelogram surrounding Dubrovnik consists of four strong fortresses at its most significant points. To the north is the strong circular Minčeta Tower, and to the east side of the city port is the Revelin Fortress. The western city entrance is protected by the strong and nicely-shaped Fort Bokar, and the strong, freestanding, St. Lawrence Fortress (also known as [[Lovrijenac]]), protects the western side of the city from possible land and sea assaults. The large and complex St. John Fortress is located on the southeast side of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;sitiunescoadriatico&quot;/&gt;

===Land Walls===
The main wall on the landside is {{convert|4|m}} to {{convert|6|m}} thick, and, at certain locations, the walls reach up to 25 meters (80&amp;nbsp;feet) in height.&lt;ref name=&quot;JamesStewart&quot;/&gt;
The land walls stretch from Fort Bokar in the west to the detached Revelin Fortress in the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;geographica&quot;/&gt; On the landside, the wall is protected with an additional range of slanted supporting walls as defense against artillery fire, especially against possible Ottoman attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;JamesStewart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=RobinHarris&gt;{{cite book | first=Robin | last=Harris | year=2003 | title=Dubrovnik, A History | publisher=[[Saqi Books]] | isbn=0-86356-332-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gates====
The town has four city gates: two that lead to the harbor and two (with drawbridges) that lead to the mainland. During the time period when the [[Austrian Empire]] controlled the city, two more gates were opened in the wall.&lt;ref name=gulet&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gulet-croatia.info/destinations/dalmatia-dubrovnik/Dubrovnik.asp | title=Dubrovnik | work=Gulet-croatia.info | publisher=ADRIA travel | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication with the outside world on the land side was maintained with the city through two main well-protected city [[gate]]s, one placed on the western side of the city and the other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;sitiunescoadriatico&quot;/&gt;

=====Gate of Pile=====
The Pile Gates are a well-fortified complex with multiple doors, defended by Fort Bokar and the [[moat]] that ran around the outside section of the city walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;sitiunescoadriatico&quot;/&gt; At the entrance gate to the Old Town, on the western side of the land walls, there is a stone bridge between two [[Gothic architecture|Gothic arches]], which were designed by the esteemed architect [[Paskoje Miličević Mihov|Paskoje Miličević]] in 1471. That bridge connects to another bridge, a wooden [[drawbridge]] which can be pulled up.&lt;ref name=dubrovnik-online&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dubrovnik-online.net/english/monuments.php | title=Monuments of Dubrovnik | work=Dubrovnik-online.net | publisher=Dubrovnik Online | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the republican era, the wooden drawbridge to the Pile Gate was hoisted each night with considerable pomp in a ceremony which delivered the city's keys to the Ragusan [[Rector (politics)|rector]]. Today, it spans a dry moat whose garden offers respite from crowds. Above the bridges, over the arch of town's principal gateway, there is a statue of city patron [[Saint Blaise]] ({{lang-hr|Sveti Vlaho}}), with a model of the [[Renaissance]] city. After passing the Pile Gate's original [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] inner gateway, it is possible to reach one of a three access points to the city walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;JamesStewart&quot;/&gt;

=====Gate of Ploče=====
On the eastern side of the land walls stands the second major entrance to the city, the Gate of Ploče. This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch.&lt;ref name=&quot;sitiunescoadriatico&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt; The Outer Gate of Ploče was designed and constructed by architect [[Mihajlo Hranjac]] in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miličević. Miličević was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-online&quot;/&gt;

=====Gate of Buža=====
The Gate of Buža (meaning &quot;hole&quot;) is located on the northern side of the land walls. This gate is relatively new compared to the other gates, as it was constructed during the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=Bradtguide&gt;{{cite book | first1=Piers | last1=Letcher | first2=Robin | last2=McKelvie | first3=Jenny | last3=McKelvie | pages=145–146 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=JM6TwY9_1ZkC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=Gate+of+Buza&amp;q=Gate%20of%20Buza | title=Dubrovnik | publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] | edition=2nd | date=May 2007 | origyear=2005 | isbn=978-1-84162-191-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea Walls===
The main wall on the sea-facing side of Dubrovnik stretches from Fort Bokar in the west to St. John Fortress in the south, and to the Revelin Fortress on the land-side. These walls are 1.5 to 5 meters (5–16&amp;nbsp;feet) thick, depending on their location and its strategic importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;geographica&quot;/&gt; The purpose of these walls were to help defend the city from sea-based attacks, particularly from the Republic of Venice, which was often considered a threat to Dubrovnik's safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobinHarris&quot;/&gt;

====City Harbour====
One of the oldest sectors of Dubrovnik was constructed around a [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] castle by the sea, which stretched landwards a bit more than it does today. It was constructed on the site of the [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]] [[cathedral]] and the [[Rector's Palace, Dubrovnik|Rector's Palace]], thus encircling the city's harbour. The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miličević in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a [[triptych]] painted by the artist [[Nikola Božidarević]] around 1500.&lt;ref name=tzdubrovnik&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tzdubrovnik.hr/eng/vodic_novost.php?id=1540&amp;id_main=1606#.UKeip2dD1pE | title=The City Harbour | work=Tzdubrovnik.hr | publisher=Dubrovnik Tourist Board | accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent portion of the harbour is the three enormous arches (the fourth original arch was walled in) of a large [[arsenal]] built in the late 12th century and enlarged in the latter part 15th century. The harbour is also the oldest [[shipyard]] within the city and is still in use today.&lt;ref name=&quot;tzdubrovnik&quot;/&gt;

Porporela was built in 1873, next to St. John Fortress. The Kase jetty ([[Breakwater (structure)|Kaše Breakwater]]) was built in 1485, according to the design of Paskoje Miličević, in order to defend the harbour and protect it from south-eastern winds and waves. The breakwater thus shortened the [[boom (navigational barrier)|harbour's bulky chain]] stretched in the night from the St. John Fortress to St. Luke's tower. It was constructed of huge stone blocks laid over wooden foundations without [[Binder (material)|binder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tzdubrovnik&quot;/&gt;

Today, the arsenal hosts the City Café and a movie theatre, whereas both the harbour and Porporela have become pleasant promenades and tourist attractions.&lt;ref name=&quot;tzdubrovnik&quot;/&gt;
{{wide image|A Panoramic from Revelin.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|A panorama from Revelin Fortress at City Harbour.}}

====Gates====
In the city port area, one of the most significant areas of the maritime trade city, there were two entrances: the Gate of Ponte (port) and the Fishmarket Gate. The entire layout of the Dubrovnik streets, as well as a range of expansions, was intended for fast and effective communication with the forts of the city walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;sitiunescoadriatico&quot;/&gt;

=====Gate of Ponte=====
Constructed in 1476, the Gate of Ponte is situated westwards from the Great Arsenal. The city wall, built at the same period, leads from the Gate to St. John Fortress. The present-day street of Damjan Juda was formed in the 15th century when the sewage system was completed, and building houses against the western city wall was no longer allowed.&lt;ref name=&quot;tzdubrovnik&quot;/&gt;

=====The Fishmarket Gate=====
The Fishmarket Gate, built in 1381, stands eastward from the Great Arsenal. The three arches of the 15th century Small Arsenal, where small boats were repaired, are situated a bit further. The old tower of St. Luke's protects the harbour in the east, and the harbour entrance is encircled and guarded by the Revelin Fortress.&lt;ref name=&quot;tzdubrovnik&quot;/&gt;

===Forts within walls===
The [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 to the Ottomans was a clear sign to the cautious citizens of Dubrovnik that ample defensive measures were quickly needed, the strengthening of its defensive structures the foremost of the issues. The [[Fall of Bosnia to the Ottomans|fall of Bosnia]], which followed soon in 1463, only hastened the works. As a result, the Republic invited the architect [[Michelozzo|Michelozzo di Bartolomeo of Florence]] to direct the improvement of the city's defenses. His work in Dubrovnik resulted in the construction and expansion of numerous buildings of key importance for the defense of Dubrovnik.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt;

====Minčeta Tower====
The Minčeta Tower was built by a local builder named [[Nicifor Ranjina]] and Italian engineers sent by [[Pope Pius II]] in 1463, at the height of the Turkish threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Harriet | last=Towers Bjelovucic | page=59 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=f-cUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=ivan+stojanovic&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=minceta | title=The Ragusan republic: victim of Napoleon and its own conservatism | publisher=Brill | year=1970 | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally as a strong four-sided fort, it is the most prominent point in the defensive system towards the land. The tower's name derives from the name of the [[House of Menčetić|Menčetić family]], who owned the ground upon which the tower was built. By its height and impressive volume, the tower dominates the northwestern high part of the city and its walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt; In the middle of the 15th century, around the earlier quadrilateral fort, [[Michelozzo]] built a new round tower using new warfare technique and joined it to the new system of low [[Counterscarp|scarp walls]]. The full six-meter (20&amp;nbsp;feet) thick walls of the new tower had a series of protected gun ports. The architect and sculptor [[Giorgio da Sebenico]] of [[Zadar]] continued the work on the Minčeta tower. He designed and built the high narrow round tower while the [[battlement]]s are a later addition. The tower was completed in 1464 and became the symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&quot;''...symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.''&quot; Dubrovnik citizens surrendered to the French army in 1806 by permitting their entrance into the city. Although Dubrovnik was not conquered by France in war, two years later in 1808, Marshal [[Auguste de Marmont]] abolished the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamated its territory into the French Illyrian Provinces.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt;

After a long excavation, a 16th-century cannon foundry was discovered under Minčeta Tower in Gornji ugao (Upper Tower). It is now a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatiatraveller.com/southern_dalmatia/Dubrovnik/Walls.htm|title=Dubrovnik's Walls|work=croatiatraveller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Minčeta Tower is the highest point of the wall, it is considered to offer a seemingly &quot;unforgettable&quot; view on the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt;

====Fort Bokar====
The Fort Bokar, often called &quot;Zvjezdan&quot;, is considered to be amongst the most beautiful instances of harmonious and functional fortification architecture. Built as a two-story casemate fortress by Michelozzo from 1461 to 1463, while the city walls were being reconstructed, it stands in front of the medieval wall face protruding into space almost with its whole cylindrical volume. It was conceived as the key point in the defense of the Pila Gate, the western fortified entrance of the city; and after the Minčeta Tower, it is the second key point in the defense of the western land approach to the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt; It is said to be the oldest casemented fortress in Europe, which contains a small lapidary collection and numerous cannons.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-online&quot;/&gt;

====St. John Fortress====
The St. John Fortress ({{lang-hr|Sveti Ivan}}), often called Mulo Tower, is a complex monumental building on the southeastern side of the old city port, controlling and protecting its entrance. The first fort was built in the mid 14th century, but it was modified on several occasions in the course of the 15th and 16th centuries, which can be seen in the triptych made by the painter Nikola Božidarević in the Dominican monastery. The painting shows Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt; Dominant in the port ambiance, the St. John Fortress prevented access of [[Piracy|pirates]] and other enemy ships. Always cautious at the first sign of danger, the inhabitants of Dubrovnik used to close the entry into the port with [[boom (navigational barrier)|heavy chains]] stretched between the St. John Fortress and the Kase jetty, and they also used to wall up all the port entries to the Great Arsenal.&lt;ref name=bestindubrovnik&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bestindubrovnik.com/must_see/4/default.aspx# | title=The Old Port | work=Bestindubrovnik.com |accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the fortress houses an [[aquarium]] on the ground floor, stocked with fishes from various parts of the Adriatic Sea. On the upper floors there is an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and a [[maritime museum]] devoted to the Republic Maritime Period, the Age of Steam, the [[Second World War]], and the section of techniques of sailing and navigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-online&quot;/&gt;

===Detached forts===

====Revelin Fortress====
In the period of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a detached fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Ploče Gate was built to the east of the city in 1462. The name Revelin derives from ''rivelino'' (ravelin), a term in military architecture which refers to work built opposite the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack. Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First [[Holy League (1495)|Holy League]], and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired [[Antonio Ferramolino]], an experienced builder of fortresses in the service of the [[Spain|Spanish]] admiral [[Andrea Doria|Doria]], a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new, much stronger Revelin Fortress. It took 11 years to build it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt;

The new Revelin became the strongest of the city fortresses, safeguarding the eastern land approach to the city. Shaped in the form of an irregular quadrilateral with one of its sides descending towards the sea, it is protected by a deep ditch on the other. One bridge crosses the protective ditch and connects it to the Ploče Gate, while another bridge connects it to the eastern suburb. The construction work was executed so perfectly so that the devastating [[1667 Dubrovnik earthquake|earthquake of 1667]] did not damage Revelin. Divided into three large vaulted rooms in its interior, Revelin became the administrative center of the Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt;

====St. Lawrence Fortress====
{{Main article|Lovrijenac}}
St. Lawrence Fortress ({{lang-hr|Lovrijenac}}), often called Dubrovnik's Gibraltar, is located outside the western city walls, {{convert|37|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=timemert&gt;[http://www.timemert.com/family.htm Dubrovnik] Tim Emert. Retrieved 5 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress has a quadrilateral court with mighty arches and, as its height is uneven, it has 3 terraces with powerful parapets with the broadest one looking south towards the sea. Lovrijenac was defended with 10 large cannons, the largest and most famous of which was called &quot;Lizard&quot; ({{lang-hr|Gušter}}). The walls exposed to enemy fire are almost 12 meters (39&amp;nbsp;feet) thick, but the large wall surface facing the city does not exceed 60 [[centimetre]]s (2&amp;nbsp;feet). Two [[drawbridge]]s lead to the fort, there being the inscription ''&quot;Non Bene Pro Toto Libertas Venditur Auro&quot;''&amp;nbsp;– &quot;Freedom is not to be sold for all the treasures in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt; above the gate. To ensure loyalty, the troops in St. Lawrence Fortress were rotated every 30 days. And to ensure complete loyalty, they were given only 30 days of rations when they went into the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;timemert&quot;/&gt; According to old scripts it was built in only three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-online&quot;/&gt;

Today its interior is one of the most dignified stages in Europe, and a well-known place for [[William Shakespeare's Hamlet]] performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-online&quot;/&gt;

===Walls of Ston===
{{Main article|Walls of Ston}}
The Walls of Ston are originally a series of defensive stone walls of more than {{convert|7|km|mi}} long.&lt;ref name=citywallsdubrovnik&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.citywallsdubrovnik.hr/hr-stonske.htm | work=Citywallsdubrovnik.hr | publisher=Društvo prijatelja dubrovačke starine | title=Stonske zidine | language=Croatian | accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its small size, the well protected Republic of Ragusa decided to use [[Pelješac]] to build another line of defense. At Pelješac's narrowest point, just before joining the mainland, a wall from [[Ston]] to Mali Ston was built.&lt;ref name=vthawaii&gt;{{cite web | first=Aloha | last=Dean | url=http://www.vthawaii.com/EXTRA/Ston/Ston.html | title=Ston and Mali (the little) Ston&amp;nbsp;– Second longest wall in all of Europe | work=Vthawaii.com | publisher=VTHawaii.Com | accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's {{convert|5.5|km|mi|adj=on}} long wall that links these two small communities has the shape of a pentagon. It was completed in the 15th century along with other 40 towers and 5 fortresses. The &quot;wall&quot; meant protection to the precious salt pans that greatly contributed to Dubrovnik's wealth, which are still being worked today. It is the second longest wall in Europe, surpassed only by the [[Hadrian's Wall]] between [[Scotland]] and [[England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vthawaii&quot;/&gt;

===Falcon Fortress===
{{Main article|House of Sanković}}
The Falcon Fortress ({{lang-hr|Soko Grad}}) was one of the largest and most important fortresses on the territory of the Republic of Ragusa, due to its position in the mountainous region near the Bosnian inland. It was built at the location of earlier [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] and later [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fortifications, evident from the remains of ceramics and Roman bricks in its walls. In 1391, the [[House of Sanković|Sanković brothers]], at that time the rulers of [[Konavle]], gave to the Republic of Rag full authority over the Falcon Fortress, while it came under republic's final possession only in 1423.&lt;ref name=kulturniturizam&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kulturniturizam.croatia.hr/Destinations/DestinationDocument.aspx?idLanguage=2&amp;idDestination=2&amp;idCategory=824&amp;idDocument=2597 | title=The Sokol (Falcon) Fortress | work=Kulturniturizam.croatia.hr | publisher=[[Croatian National Tourist Board]] | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its strategic importance, the Republic of Ragusa constantly invested in the maintenance of the fortress, which contained a cistern, a powder storage, wine and food cellars, sentry-boxes, military barracks, and sanctuary buildings to accommodate refugees from nearby villages in the event of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;kulturniturizam&quot;/&gt;

===Imperial Fortress===
{{Main article|Illyrian Provinces}}
The Fortress is placed at the top of the mountain [[Srđ]], just above the city of Dubrovnik. It was built in 1806 by [[Auguste de Marmont|Marshal Marmont]], called the Imperial, in honor of emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. The fortress was strategically important to defend the northern side of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oiv.hr/default.asp?ru=125&amp;gl=200710030000001&amp;sid=&amp;jezik=1 |title=Odašiljački objekti OIV-a | work=Oiv.hr | publisher=[[Odašiljači i veze]] | language=Croatian | accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevlaka Fortress===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Dalmatia}}
This fortress is placed at Ponta Oštro, at the very end of [[Prevlaka]] peninsula. It was built in the mid-19th century, between 1856 and 1862, as part of the fortification system of the [[Bay of Kotor]] at the time of the Austrian Empire. By its monumentality and unique structure, it presents an exceptional example of military architecture of its time. Today, the fortress is out of use and badly damaged by various destructions during history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.omega-engineering.hr/projekt.php?idproj=79&amp;lang=eng | title=Prevlaka Fortress | work=Omega-engineering.hr | publisher=Omega Engineering d.o.o. | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saracen siege in 866–867===
{{Main article|Byzantine–Arab Wars (780–1180)}}
In 866, a major [[Arab people|Arab]] raid along [[Dalmatia]] struck [[Budva]] and [[Kotor]], and then laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867. The city appealed to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Basil I|Basil the Macedonian]], who responded by sending over one hundred ships.&lt;ref name=JohnVanAntwerpFinep257&gt;{{cite book | last=Fine | first=John Van Antwerp | page=257 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YbS9QmwDC58C&amp;pg=RA1-PA257&amp;dq=Arab+raid+of+Dubrovnik,+Fine&amp;q=Arab%20raid%20of%20Dubrovnik | title=The early medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the sixth to the late twelfth century | year=1991 | publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] | isbn=0-472-08149-7&lt;!--9780472081493--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the 866–867 Saracens' siege of Dubrovnik, which lasted fifteen months, was raised due to the intervention of Basil I, who sent a fleet under the command of [[Niketas Oryphas]] in relief of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=H.T. | last=Norris | year=1994 | title=Islam in the Balkans | publisher=C.

===Venetian siege in 948===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)}}
With the weakening of [[Byzantium]], Venice began to see Ragusa as a rival who needed to be brought under her control, but the attempt to conquer the city in 948 failed. The citizens of the city attributed this to [[Saint Blaise]], whom they adopted as the patron saint of the city.&lt;ref name=short&gt;{{cite book | first=Frederick Bernard | last=Singleton | page=68 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qTLSZ3ucaZMC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=A+Short+History+of+the+Yugoslav+Peoples&amp;q=Venetian%20siege%20in%20948 | title=A Short History of the Yugoslav Peoples | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1985 | isbn=0-521-27485-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nemanja's siege in 1185===
{{Main article|Stefan Nemanja}}
After some territorial disputes, war broke out between [[Stefan Nemanja]], [[Grand prince]] of [[Serbian Grand Principality|Raška]], and the city of Dubrovnik, at that time under [[Normans|Norman]] [[suzerainty]]. In 1185, Nemanja attacked the city and laid siege to it,&lt;ref name=JohnVanAntwerpFine&gt;{{cite book | last=Fine | first=John Van Antwerp | pages=8–9 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=QDFVUDmAIqIC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Nemanja+attacked+the+city+of+Dubrovnik#v=onepage&amp;q=Nemanja%20attacked%20the%20city%20of%20Dubrovnik | title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest | year=1994 | publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] | isbn=0-472-08260-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a Ragusan counter-attack drove Nemanja's forces back. According to chronicles from Dubrovnik, which are accepted by most historians, the siege ultimately failed.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;However, there are some indications that the siege was severe and possibly resulted in a partial or integral penetration of Nemanja's forces into part of the city's area.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnVanAntwerpFine&quot;/&gt; How much help Dubrovnik received from the Normans while repelling the siege is also not known exactly.&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnVanAntwerpFine&quot;/&gt;

===Venetian and Fourth Crusades siege in 1205===
{{Main article|Fourth Crusade}}
In 1205, the Republic of Venice invaded [[Dalmatia]] with the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]]. Ragusa was forced to pay a tribute, eventually becoming a source of supplies for Venice, thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the [[Siege of Zara]], used as Venice's naval base in the southern [[Adriatic Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Frederic Chapin | last=Lane | page=63 | url=http://www.flipkart.com/venice-maritime-republic-frederic-chapin/080181460x-76w3fuf6cb#previewbook | title=Venice, a Maritime Republic | publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | year=1973 | isbn=0-8018-1460-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, after liberation from Venetian supremacy, extensive work was done on the walls to ensure the republic's liberty.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubrovnik-guide&quot;/&gt;

===Siege by Stjepan Vukčić Kosača in 1451===
{{Main article|Stjepan Vukčić Kosača}}
In 1451, the very powerful Bosnian regional lord Herzeg [[Stjepan Vukčić Kosača]] attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 [[ducat]]s, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, and an annual income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him, along with the promise of hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. Stjepan was so scared by the threat that he finally raised the siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viator&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first= | last=Medieval and Renaissance Studies | pages=388–389 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=v9swtfALoisC&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq=Stjepan+Vuk%C4%8Di%C4%87+Kosa%C4%8Da&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q= | title=Viator | publisher=University of California Press | year=1978 | isbn=0-520-03608-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian siege in 1806===
{{Main article|Napoleonic Wars}}
By 1800, the Republic had a highly organized network of consulates and consular offices in more than eighty cities and ports around the world. In 1806, the Republic surrendered to the forces of the [[First French Empire]] to end a months-long siege by the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] fleet during which 3,000 [[Round shot|cannonballs]] fell on the city. The French lifted the siege and Ragusa was saved.

===Anglo-Austrian siege in 1814===
{{Main article|Siege of Ragusa}}
Austria [[War of the Sixth Coalition|declared war on France]] in August 1813 and by the Autumn the [[Royal Navy]] enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea. Working in conjunction with the Austrian armies now invading the Illyrian Provinces and Northern Italy Rear Admiral [[Thomas Fremantle (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Fremantle's]] ships were able to rapidly transport British and Austrian troops from one point to another, forcing the surrender of the strategic ports one after another December.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ6:257&quot;&gt;James, Vol. 6, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[William Hoste]] with his ship [[HMS Bacchante (1811)|HMS ''Bacchante'']] (38 guns) along with HMS ''Saracen'' an 18 gun brig, arrived at Ragusa already blockaded by Pro Austrian Croat forces led by Todor Milutinović. The British with the Austrians were able to take the Imperial fortress and positions on Lokrum island. By hauling cannon up to Srđ hill they bombarded the city until the French General [[Joseph Hélie Désiré Perruquet de Montrichard|Joseph de Montrichard]] decided it was best to surrender. British and Croat troops entered the city via the Pile gates shutting the Ragusan rebels out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cosic2000&quot;/&gt;{{rp|141}}

===Yugoslav army siege in 1991–1992===
{{Main article|Siege of Dubrovnik}}
The Siege of Dubrovnik ({{lang-hr|Opsada Dubrovnika}}) is a term marking the battle and siege of the city of Dubrovnik and the surrounding area in [[Croatia]] as part of the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. Dubrovnik was besieged and attacked by forces of the Serb-dominated [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) in late 1991, with the major fighting ending in early 1992, and the Croatian counterattack finally lifting the siege and liberating the area in mid-1992. At the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), the prosecution alleged that, &quot;It was the objective of the Serb forces to detach this area from Croatia and to annex it to Montenegro.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Summary&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/ind/en/mil-2ai020728e.htm | title=Investigative Summary | publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] | date=23 October 2002 | accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the [[American Institute of Architects]] condemned the bombardment of the city's buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zaknic | first=Ivan | date=November 1992 | title=The Pain of Ruins: Croatian Architecture under Siege | jstor=1425208 | journal=Journal of Architectural Education | publisher=Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture | volume=46 | issue=2 | page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, in conjunction with [[UNESCO]], found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) had been hit by projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at [[United States dollar|$]]9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY Press release&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icty.org/sid/7948 | title=Full Contents of the Dubrovnik Indictment made Public | publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] | date=2 October 2001 | accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a testament to the resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ehq.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/2/197 | title=Dubrovnik’s Artistic Patrimony, and its Role in War Reporting (1991) | author=Pearson, Joseph (2010)| work=European History Quarterly, Vol. 40, No. 2, pp. 197-216 | accessdate=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
