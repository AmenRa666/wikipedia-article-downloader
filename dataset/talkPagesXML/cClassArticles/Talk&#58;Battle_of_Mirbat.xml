== Talaiasi Labalaba Rank ==
I watched a documentary on the SAS's actions in Oman and it stated that Talaiasi Labalaba, the Fijian trooper, was a Corporal, not a Sgt.

He's a Corporal on this list: http://www.specwarnet.net/europe/memorial.html [[User:Hakluyt bean|Hakluyt bean]] ([[User talk:Hakluyt bean|talk]]) 02:17, 3 May 2008 (UTC)

::I stand corrected: '''Staff Sgt''' according to the [http://www.royalirishrangers.co.uk/role.html Royal Irish Rangers] website [[User:Hakluyt bean|Hakluyt bean]] ([[User talk:Hakluyt bean|talk]]) 02:25, 3 May 2008 (UTC)
:::And Staff Sergeant according to his citation for a Mention in Despatches in the ''London Gazette''. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 17:18, 24 November 2008 (UTC)
::::Although it should be noted that the rank an individual holds within the SAS is not necessarily the same one they hold in their parent regiment. On joining the SAS all rankers are reduced to the rank of trooper, but they continue to officially hold the rank they previously held and are promoted according to their length of service. So Labalaba could quite easily have been a corporal in the SAS but a staff sergeant in the Royal Irish Rangers. All citations would use his official army rank. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 11:36, 25 June 2010 (UTC)

By the way, Frederick Forsyth's story The Veteran describes a fictious case of one of the SAS survivors being robbed and killed in London around 1996.[[Special:Contributions/89.102.197.114|89.102.197.114]] ([[User talk:89.102.197.114|talk]])

== Fatal casualty discrepancy ==

Evening all.  Nice to see a Wikipedia article on this battle.  But I think the contradictory description of the Brit/Fijian/Omani Government fatalies needs to be cleared up.  The fact box clearly states that TWO members of this allied force were killed in the battle.  However, the article then goes onto state that not only Labalaba and Tobin were killed in action, but that the Omani soldier, Walid Khamis, died too, (&quot;...the Omani soldier fell dead after being shot in the stomach with a 7.62mm bullet.&quot;)  So that makes three killed.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.185.21.121|86.185.21.121]] ([[User talk:86.185.21.121|talk]]) 19:13, 31 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


:And yet, later on the article states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''An Omani from the fort, Walid Khamis, was injured during the battle and received the Sultan's Gallantry Medal'' 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:Contradictory. Seems like disjointed editing. So did Khamis die during the battle after all, did he survive, or was his injury eventually fatal?

== Award for corporal Labalabas courage. ==

I read in a book about cpl. Labalabas courage and death, i have read that because of Labalabas valor during the battle, many of his colleagues in the SAS agreed that he should receive the [[Victoria Cross]], but he did'nt!

Labalaba was only mentioned in dispatches, the SAS has since Labalabas death asked the quinn to award him the medal, but she has refused.

::This is a rediculously outlandish claim. If you wish to dispute the article, please provide more substantial evidence (ie. an [[ISBN]] reference), and try to present it with some articulation: the poor quality of English draws into question the credibility. --[[User:Sonicandfffan|Sonicandfffan]] ([[User talk:Sonicandfffan|talk]]) 17:00, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

:::That was unnecessary.  Not every user of WP has English as a first language.  You've misspelt the word 'ridiculously' btw.  [[User:Hakluyt bean|Hakluyt bean]] ([[User talk:Hakluyt bean|talk]]) 03:25, 29 September 2008 (UTC)


For your info Channel 5 in UK is going to be screening a docu drama about Mirbat in November.

Labalaba could have been awarded the VC, but he couldn't have been awarded any other medal because at the time of the action only the VC (and GC) could be awarded posthumously. Failing the VC, an MiD was therefore the only award available to him. Today he would probably have been awarded a posthumous [[Conspicuous Gallantry Cross]]. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 17:16, 24 November 2008 (UTC)

== Kealy's death. ==
Is there any evidence that Kealy has been murdered? I did not read the Fiennes's book, but without proper citation it sounds hard to believe, and the explanation from &lt;ref&gt;[1]&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. Kealy died of exposure during an excersise in Brecon Beacons) seems more plausible.

::It does state the word ``alleged``--[[User:Rockybiggs|Rockybiggs]] ([[User talk:Rockybiggs|talk]]) 13:28, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

In one section it says operating the 25 pounder gun is a &quot;three man job&quot;. A later section says &quot;4-6&quot;. Which is correct?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/194.202.122.223|194.202.122.223]] ([[User talk:194.202.122.223|talk]]) 15:10, 28 July 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The standard crew is six, per the WP entry on the gun

The gun detachment comprised the following: No 1 - detachment commander (a sergeant), No 2 - operated the breech and rammed the shell, No 3 - layer, No 4 - loader, No 5 - ammunition, No 6 - ammunition, normally the 'coverer' - second in command and responsible for ammunition preparation and operating the fuze indicator.

The official 'reduced detachment' was 4 men. [[User:Winterbadger|Winterbadger]] ([[User talk:Winterbadger|talk]]) 18:14, 6 October 2009 (UTC)

== Omani participants ==

I'm adjusting the OB listing, as it seems a bit unfair to simply ignore the Omani troops who participated. [[User:Winterbadger|Winterbadger]] ([[User talk:Winterbadger|talk]]) 18:54, 6 October 2009 (UTC)

::Given that all available first-hand testimony attests that the Omani soldiers (with one notable exception) decided to ignore the battle and hole up in the fort, why should they be included?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.143.252.125|86.143.252.125]] ([[User talk:86.143.252.125|talk]]) 14:25, 12 May 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:::Weren't there a hundred or so firqat 'reservists' involved in this one as well? I remember being told that although the adoo rocked up when the main firqat force was out on a job, there was a substantial group of fighters - mostly old men and boys still in training - who put up some kind of fight in the area between the town fence and the building line. I'll have to chase it up - I think the old boy who told me about it has turned up his toes though.[[Special:Contributions/213.121.242.7|213.121.242.7]] ([[User talk:213.121.242.7|talk]]) 12:41, 25 March 2011 (UTC)


:::well bro i read this &quot;In the service of th Sultan by Ian Gardiner&quot; - as per that omani participants were very limited.there were a dozzen or so Omanis under the SAS at Mirbat, and as far as i recollect as per the author..it was solely SAS vs Adoo --[[User:Pranav21391|Pranav]] ([[User talk:Pranav21391|talk]]) 18:14, 25 March 2011 (UTC)

==Potentially useful source==
This Daily Telegraph obituary for [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/7734339/Wing-Commander-Bill-Stoker.html Wing Commander Bill Stoker] provides information that might be potentially useful for an expansion of the final stages of this engagement.--[[User:Jackyd101|Jackyd101]] ([[User talk:Jackyd101|talk]]) 23:38, 24 July 2010 (UTC)
I note that Pete &quot;Snapper&quot; Winner does not appear in the list of soldiers who participated; is this an oversight? He discusses the action in his new book Soldier 'I', was also noted by McNab in Seven Troop to have been present [iTunes audiobook and printed versions] and also appears in the Discovery SAS Heroes documentary on Mirbat [repeated 15th Sept 2010; UK].  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/94.0.55.151|94.0.55.151]] ([[User talk:94.0.55.151|talk]]) 07:43, 13 September 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
