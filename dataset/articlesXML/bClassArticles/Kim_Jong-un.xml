On 9 March 2014, Kim Jong-un was elected unopposed to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. At {{age|1984|1|8}} years of age, Kim is the first North Korean leader born after the country's founding.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Schule Liebefeld-Steinhölzli, Köniz.jpg|thumb|left|The Liebefeld-Steinhölzli public school in [[Köniz]], [[Switzerland]], which Kim Jong-un is reported to have attended.]]

Scarce information on Kim Jong-un's early life comes from [[North Korean defectors]] and people who have claimed to witness him abroad, such as during his school attendance in Switzerland. Some of the information has been conflicting and contradictory, perhaps conflating him with his brother, [[Kim Jong-chul]], who also attended school in Switzerland around the same time. Nevertheless, there has been some consensus on information about his early life. North Korean authorities have stated that his birthdate is 8 January 1982, but South Korean intelligence officials believe the actual date is a year later. [[Dennis Rodman]] said that the birthdate is 8 January 1983 after meeting Kim in September 2013.&lt;ref name=NYTRodman&gt;{{cite news|title=Rodman Gives Details on Trip to North Korea|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 September 2013|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/world/asia/rodman-gives-details-on-trip-to-north-korea.html|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Jong-Un was the second of three children [[Ko Yong-hui]] bore to Kim Jong-il; his elder brother Kim Jong-chul was born in 1981, while his younger sister, [[Kim Yo-jong]], is believed to have been born in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Kim Jong-un’s sister is having a ball |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2957573 |archive-date=16 October 2015 |work=Korea JoongAng Daily |date=8 August 2012 |last1=Lee |first1=Young-jong |last2=Kim |first2=Hee-jin |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016211015/koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2957573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim Yo Jong&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Kim Yo Jong |url=https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/kji-2/kim-yo-jong/ |publisher=North Korea Leadership Watch |accessdate=15 October 2014 |date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to reports first published in Japanese newspapers, he went to school in [[Switzerland]] near [[Bern]]. First reports claimed he attended the private English-language International School in [[Gümligen]] under the name &quot;Chol-pak&quot; or &quot;Pak-chol&quot; from 1993-98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/01/AR2009060103750.html|work=The Washington Post|author=Blaine Harden|title=Son Named Heir to North Korea's Kim Studied in Switzerland, Reportedly Loves NBA|date=3 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/7810203/Rare-photos-of-Kim-Jong-ils-youngest-son-Kim-Jong-un-released.html|location=London, UK|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=Peter Foster|title=Rare photos of Kim Jong-il's youngest son, Kim Jong-un, released|date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3245311/School-days-struggles-of-the-dictators-son-Kim-Jong-un.html|location=London, UK|work=The Sun|first1=Allan|last1=Hall|title=Profile|date=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described as shy, a good student who got along well with his classmates and was a basketball fan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/02/kim-jong-il-names-son-successor|title=North Korean leader Kim Jong‑il ‘names youngest son as successor'|agency=Associated Press |work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|issn=0261-3077|date=2 June 2009 |archive-date=16 October 2015|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016211014/www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/02/kim-jong-il-names-son-successor}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]] by an older student, who was thought to be his bodyguard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henckel2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.welt.de/welt_print/article3985896/Kim-Jong-un-und-sein-Unterricht-bei-den-Schweizern.html|title=Kim Jong-un und sein Unterricht bei den Schweizern|work=Die Welt|issn=0173-8437|location=Berlin|first=Elisalex|last=Henckel|date=24 June 2009|language=German|archivedate=27 July 2015|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727053343/www.welt.de/welt_print/article3985896/Kim-Jong-un-und-sein-Unterricht-bei-den-Schweizern.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, it was reported that Kim Jong-un attended the Liebefeld Steinhölzli school in [[Köniz]] near Bern under the name &quot;Pak-un&quot; or &quot;Un-pak&quot; from 1998 until 2000 as the son of an employee of the Embassy of North Korea. Authorities of Köniz confirmed that a student from North Korea, registered as the son of a member of the Embassy, attended the school from August 1998 until the autumn of 2000, but were unable to give details about his identity. Pak-un first attended a special class for foreign-language children and later attended the regular classes of the 6th, 7th, 8th, and part of the final 9th year, leaving the school abruptly in the autumn of 2000.

In April 2012, new documents came to light indicating that Kim Jong-un had lived in Switzerland since 1991 or 1992, earlier than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lematin.ch/suisse/kim-jongun-reste-neuf-ans-suisse/story/20273993|title=Kim Jong-un est resté neuf ans en Suisse|author=Titus Plattner|accessdate=24 April 2012|date=21 April 2012|work=Le Matin|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laboratory of Anatomic Anthropology at the [[University of Lyon]], France, after comparing the picture of the boy Pak-un taken at the Liebefeld Steinhölzli school in 1999 with a picture of Kim Jong-un from 2012 came to the conclusion that the two faces show a conformity of 95%.

===Pre-2010 Party Conference speculation===
His eldest half-brother, [[Kim Jong-nam]], had been the favorite to succeed, but reportedly fell out of favor after 2001, when he was caught attempting to enter Japan on a [[fake passport]] to visit [[Tokyo Disneyland]].&lt;ref name=rthk&gt;[http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?main&amp;20090718&amp;56&amp;597742 Kim Jong-il's grandson seen at concert].

Despite the elder Kim's plans, it was not immediately clear after his death whether Jong-un would in fact take full power, and what his exact role in a new government would be.&lt;ref name=&quot;Branigan2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim Jong-il, North Korean leader, dies|first=Tania|last=Branigan|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-il-north-korean-leader-dies|work=The Guardian|date=19 December 2011|archive-date=14 August 2015|location=London, UK|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814114449/www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-il-north-korean-leader-dies |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts had predicted that when Kim Jong-il died, [[Jang Sung-taek]] would act as [[regent]], as Jong-un was too inexperienced to immediately lead the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace2013&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim Jong‑il's heir Kim Jong‑un made general|first1=Rick|last1=Wallace|first2=Michael|last2=Sainsbury|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/kim-jong-ils-heir-kim-jong-un-made-general/story-e6frg6so-1225931178505 |newspaper=The Australian|issn=1038-8761|date=29 September 2010 |archive-date=25 December 2013 |dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225061032/www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/kim-jong-ils-heir-kim-jong-un-made-general/story-e6frg6so-1225931178505}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 December 2011, North Korean television showed Jang Sung-taek in the uniform of a general in a sign of his growing sway after the death of Kim Jong-il. A Seoul official familiar with North Korea affairs said it was the first time Jang has been shown on state television in a military uniform. His appearance suggested that Jang had secured a key role in the North's powerful military, which pledged its allegiance to Kim Jong-un.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shim2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-north-power-idUSTRE7BO02I20111225|title=North Korean power‑behind‑throne emerges as neighbors meet|publisher=Reuters|date=25 December 2011 |archive-date=7 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107225817/www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-north-power-idUSTRE7BO02I20111225|dead-url=no|first1=Sung-won|last1=Shim|first2=Kiyoshi|last2=Takenaka|first3=Chris|last3=Buckley|editor-first=Yoko|editor-last=Nishikawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Korea's cult of personality]] around Kim Jong-un was stepped up following his father's death.

On 26 December 2011, the leading North Korean newspaper ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]'' announced that Kim Jong-un had been acting as chairman of the Central Military Commission,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/topics/2011/12/26/81/4603000000AEN20111226003700315F.HTML N.

On 9 January 2012, a large rally was held by [[Korean People's Army]] in front of [[Kumsusan Memorial Palace]] to honor Kim Jong-un and demonstrate loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Military Rallies in Keumsusan Square|author=So Yeol Kim|accessdate=10 January 2012|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01700&amp;num=8664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assuming official titles===
On 27 March 2012, Kim was elected to the Fourth Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea. On 11 April, that conference elected him as leader of the party under the newly created title of First Secretary. This position replaced the post of General Secretary, which was awarded &quot;eternally&quot; to Kim Jong-il. At the conference, Kim Jong-un also took his father's post as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, as well as his father's old seat on the Politburo Presidium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kim Takes More Top Posts |author=Chris Green |accessdate=12 April 2012 |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01700&amp;num=9100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech made prior to the Conference, Kim Jong-un declared that &quot;Imbuing the whole society with Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the highest programme of our Party&quot;. On 13 April 2012, the 5th Session of the 12th Supreme People's Assembly appointed Kim Jong-un [[Chairman of the National Defence Commission]].

On 15 April 2012, during a military parade to commemorate Kim Il-sung's centenary, Kim Jong-un made his first public speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC |accessdate=14 April 2012 |date=14 April 2012 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17718011 |title=N Korea's Kim Jong-un speaks publicly for first time}}&lt;/ref&gt; That speech became the basis of &quot;[[Onwards Toward the Final Victory]]&quot;, a repeatedly aired propaganda hymn dedicated to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Branigan2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Tania|last=Branigan|title=North Korea's Kim Jong-un gets new official theme song|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/06/north-korea-kim-jong-un-song|archive-date=2 August 2015|work=The Guardian|date=6 July 2012|issn=0261-3077|location=London, UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802102716/www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/06/north-korea-kim-jong-un-song|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012,&lt;ref name=&quot;Green2012&quot;/&gt; Kim Jong-un was promoted to [[Wonsu (North Korea)|wonsu]] (roughly translated to [[marshal]]), the highest active rank in the military. The decision was jointly issued on by the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee]] and the [[Central Military Commission (North Korea)|Central Military Commission]] of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]], the [[National Defence Commission of North Korea|National Defence Commission]], and the [[Presidium]] of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]], the [[Korean Central News Agency]] subsequently announced.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

The only higher rank is [[Dae Wonsu]] (roughly translated as [[Grand Marshal]] or [[Generalissimo]]) which was held by Kim's grandfather, Kim Il-sung, and which was awarded posthumously to his father, Kim Jong-il, in February 2012.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Green2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Chris|title=Kim Jong Eun Promoted to Marshal|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01700&amp;num=9533|accessdate=18 July 2012|work=Daily NK|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promotion confirmed Kim's role as top leader of the North Korean military and came days after the replacement of Chief of General Staff [[Ri Yong-ho]] by [[Hyon Yong-chol]].&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

During a 2012 performance marking the anniversary of the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]], security around Kim reportedly increased dramatically because Kim &quot;is extremely nervous about the possibility of an emergency developing inside North Korea&quot; caused by &quot;mounting opposition to his efforts to rein in the military&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choe Dec 6&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Kim Jong-un Beefs Up Security Amid Fear of Unrest |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/12/06/2012120601143.html |work=Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=6 December 2012 |date=6 December 2012 &lt;!-- at 11:41 KST --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, satellite photos revealed a half-kilometer-long ({{convert|0.5|km|ft|disp=out}}) propaganda message carved into a hillside in [[Ryanggang Province]], reading, &quot;Long Live General Kim Jong-un, the Shining Sun!&quot; The message, located next to an artificial lake built in 2007 to serve a hydroelectric station, is made of Korean syllable blocks measuring {{convert|15|by|20|m}}, and is located approximately {{convert|9|km}} south of [[Hyesan]] near the [[China–North Korea border|border with China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NationalPost2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Half-kilometre long Kim Jong-un propaganda message visible from space|work=National Post|issn=1486-8008|archive-date=21 December 2015|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/half-kilometre-long-kim-jong-un-propaganda-message-visible-from-space|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221115623/news.nationalpost.com/news/half-kilometre-long-kim-jong-un-propaganda-message-visible-from-space|date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim Jong-il's personal chef [[Kenji Fujimoto]] stated, &quot;Stores in Pyongyang were brimming with products and people in the streets looked cheerful. North Korea has changed a lot since Kim Jong-un assumed power. All of this is because of leader Kim Jong-un.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCurry2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Justin|last=McCurry|date=10 August 2012|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/kim-jong-il-japan-chef|title=Kim Jong‑il's personal Japanese chef returns to land he fled|work=The Guardian|archivedate=2 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702173449/www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/kim-jong-il-japan-chef|dead-url=no|location=London, UK|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially, Kim Jong-un is part of a [[triumvirate]] heading the executive branch of the North Korean government along with Premier [[Pak Pong-ju]] and parliament chairman [[Kim Yong-nam]] (no relation). Each nominally holds powers equivalent to a third of a president's powers in most other presidential systems. Kim Jong-un commands the armed forces, Pak Pong-ju heads the government, and Kim Yong-nam handles foreign relations. Nevertheless, it is generally understood that Kim Jong-un, like his father and grandfather before him, exercises absolute control over the government and the country.  Indeed, a constitutional amendment enacted by his father explicitly named the NDC (first) chairman as &quot;the supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;leon_DPRK&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = DPRK has quietly amended its Constitution | last = Petrov | first = Leonid | work = Leonid Petrov's KOREA VISION | date = 12 October 2009 | accessdate = 12 September 2015 | url = https://leonidpetrov.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/dprk-has-quietly-amended-its-constitution/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|others=Amended and supplemented on April 1, Juche 102 (2013), at the Seventh Session of the Twelfth Supreme People's Assembly|title=Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/book/download.php?4+4047|year=2014|format=PDF|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|location=Pyongyang|isbn=978-9946-0-1099-1|page=22|chapter=Article 100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2012, Kim met with [[Li Jianguo]], who &quot;briefed Kim on the [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|18th National Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of China]]&quot;, according to the state's official news agency, the [[Korean Central News Agency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;letter Dec 3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Kim Jong-un Gets Letter from China's New Leader|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/12/03/2012120301309.html|publisher=Chosun.com|accessdate=6 December 2012|date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from [[Xi Jinping]] was hand-delivered during the discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;letter Dec 3&quot;/&gt;

In 2013, Kim re-established his grandfather's style when he made his first New Year's address, a break from the approach of his father. Kim Jong-il never made televised addresses during his 17 years in power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/01/world/asia/north-korea-kim-speech/index.html In first New Year speech, North Korea's Kim Jong Un calls for economic revamp], CNN.com, 2 January 2013; retrieved 23 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In lieu of delivering a speech, Kim Jong-il contributed to and approved a New Year's Day editorial, jointly published by ''Rodong Sinmun'' (the daily newspaper of the Korean Workers' Party), ''[[Joson Inmingun]]'' (the newspaper of the Korean People's Army), and ''[[Chongnyon Jonwi]]'' (the newspaper of the [[Kim Il-sung Socialist Youth League]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/ &quot;KJU Delivers New Year's Day Address&quot;].

In May 2014, following the collapse of an apartment building in Pyongyang, Kim Jong-un was said to be very upset at the loss of life that resulted. A statement issued by the country's official news agency the [[Korean Central News Agency]] used the rare expression &quot;profound consolation and apology&quot;. An unnamed government official was quoted by the [[BBC]] as saying Kim Jong-un had &quot;sat up all night, feeling painful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = North Korea offers rare apology after apartment building collapses | last = Chasmar |first = Jessica | work = The Washingtion Times | date = 18 May 2014 | accessdate = 2 January 2015 | url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/18/north-korea-offers-rare-apology-after-apartment-bu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the height of the building and the number of casualties was not released, media reports described it is a 23-story building and indicated that more than a hundred people may have died in the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = North Korea: Apology over Pyongyang building collapse | work = BBC News | date = 18 May 2014 | accessdate = 4 August 2016 | url = http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27459186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2014, Kim Jong-un was elected to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. He was unopposed, but voters had the choice of voting yes or no.

===Economic policies===
In August 2012, Kim Jong-un announced economics reforms similar to China.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Firn (6 August 2012) [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9455190/Kim-Jong-un-planning-China-like-reforms-in-North-Korea.html Kim Jong-un 'planning China-like reforms in North Korea']. ''The Daily Telegraph''. Retrieved 23 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Kim began to be mentioned by the North Korean state media as &quot;supreme leader&quot; (''chego ryongdoja'') at this time.

A set of comprehensive economic measures, the &quot;Socialist Corporate Responsible Management System&quot;, were introduced in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFES1&quot;/&gt; The measures increase the autonomy of enterprises by granting them &quot;certain rights to engage in business activities autonomously and elevate the will to labor through appropriately implementing the socialist distribution system&quot;. Another priority of economic policies that year was agriculture, where the ''pojon'' (vegetable garden) responsibility system was implemented. The system reportedly achieved a major increase in output in some collective farms.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFES1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150224_0001 |title=&quot;Socialist Enterprise Management System&quot; under Full Implementation |publisher=Institute for Far Eastern Studies |date=24 February 2015 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korean media were describing the economy as a &quot;flexible collectivist system&quot; where enterprises were applying &quot;active and evolutionary actions&quot; to achieve economic development.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFES2&quot;/&gt; These reports reflect Kim's general economic policy of reforming management, increasing the autonomy and incentives for economic actors. This set of reforms known as the &quot;May 30th measures&quot; reaffirms both socialist ownership and &quot;objective economic laws in guidance and management&quot; to improve living standards. Other objectives of the measures are to increase the availability of domestically manufactured goods on markets, introduction of defence innovations into the civilian sector and boost international trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFES2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150115_0001 |title=Kim Jong Un Stresses the Principles of Market Economy through ‘May 30th Measures’ |publisher=Institute for Far Eastern Studies |date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim's claim is considered unlikely, partly because a hydrogen bomb would be an extremely large and sudden step up in technology for a country that struggled to develop much simpler fission weapons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Holly Yan|title=North Korea nuclear bomb test: 7 key questions answered|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/06/asia/north-korea-bomb-test-key-questions/|accessdate=23 March 2016|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly because no seismic activity consistent with a successful hydrogen bomb test has been observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTDoubts&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sang-hung|first=Choe|title=North Korea Claims It Tested Hydrogen Bomb but Is Doubted|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb-claim-reactions.html|accessdate=6 January 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kim made the claim that his family &quot;turned the {{abbr|DPRK|Democratic People's Republic of Korea}} into a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation&quot;. The boastful claim was made during a visit by Kim to the Phyongchon Revolutionary Site, a museum dedicated to his grandfather Kim Il-sung.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim has H-bomb?&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Kim Jong-Un claims North Korea has a hydrogen bomb |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/12/10/kim-jong-un-claims-north-korea-has-hydrogen-bomb/?intcmp=hplnws |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other unsupported claims===

In June 2016, Kim announced via a spokesman that North Korean scientists had created a &quot;wonder drug&quot;, composed of [[ginseng]] and a mixture of other unspecified ingredients, capable of curing [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Ebola virus disease]], other viral diseases, and &quot;a number of cancers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot;&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jong-un-claims-to-have-cured-aids-ebola-and-cancer-with-single-miracle-drug-10332386.html Kim Jong-un claims to have cured Aids, Ebola and cancer with single miracle drug] Independent.co.uk (June 8, 2016), retrieved September 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  No clinical support was cited, other than an unpublished African trial claiming &quot;56 % complete cure and 44 % considerable cure&quot; of HIV/AIDS, and unspecified &quot;data from foreign health entities&quot; claiming &quot;splendid effects&quot; in preventing and curing various viral &quot;epidemics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kumdang2.com/treatment-of-diseases/epidemic-diseases-including-bird-flu-and-new-flu-aids/ Epidemic diseases including Bird Flu and New Flu, AIDS].

===Purges and executions===
As with all reporting on North Korea, individual reports of purges and executions are almost impossible to definitively verify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trianni|first1=Francesca|title=Did Kim Jong Un Really Execute His Uncle’s Extended Family?|url=http://time.com/2087/did-kim-jong-un-really-execute-his-uncles-extended-family/|accessdate=28 May 2016|work=TIME.com|date=27 January 2014|location=1:04-1:10 in embedded video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of numerous purges and executions are based in part on interviews with North Korean defectors, analysis of media issued by North Korea, non-independently-verifiable analysis of closed-source data from intelligence agencies, and occasionally satellite imagery.

In December 2013, Kim Jong-un's uncle [[Jang Sung-taek]] was arrested and executed for treachery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21591581-kim-jong-un-has-managed-improbable-feat-making-north-korea-even-scarier-crying-uncle Crying uncle] ''[[The Economist]]'', 14 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Jang Sung-taek is believed to have been executed by machine gun. [[Yonhap]] has stated that, according to multiple unnamed sources, Kim Jong-un has also put to death members of Jang's family, to completely destroy all traces of Jang's existence through &quot;extensive executions&quot; of his family, including the children and grandchildren of all close relatives. Those reportedly killed in Kim's purge include Jang's sister Jang Kye-sun, her husband and ambassador to Cuba, Jon Yong-jin, and Jang's nephew and ambassador to Malaysia, Jang Yong-chol. The nephew's two sons were also said to have been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com//news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20140127000056&amp;cid=1101|title=Jang Sung-taek's remaining family executed by Kim Jong-un|work=[[Want China Times]]|date=27 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705171755/www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx/?id=20140127000056&amp;cid=1101|archivedate=5 July 2015|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=N Korea executes relatives of Kim Jong-Un's dead uncle: reports|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-27/north-korea-executes-family-of-uncle-of-kim-jong-un-reports-say/5221194|accessdate=28 May 2016|work=ABC News|date=27 January 2014|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Jang's removal, it was announced that &quot;the discovery and purge of the Jang group ... made our party and revolutionary ranks purer ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/830936.shtml Kim’s uncle stripped of all posts, expelled from WPK] ''[[Xinhua News Agency]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and after his execution on 12 December 2013 state media warned that the army &quot;will never pardon all those who disobey the order of the Supreme Commander&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/12/13/12/0301000000AEN20131213002400315F.html N.

O Sang-hon ({{korean|오상헌|rr= O Sangheon|mr=O Sanghŏn|context=north}}) was a deputy security minister in the [[Ministry of Public Security (North Korea)|Ministry of Public Security]] in the government of [[North Korea]] who was reportedly killed in a political purge in 2014. According to the Korean newspaper ''[[Chosun Ilbo]]'', O was executed by [[flamethrower]] for his role in supporting Kim Jong-un's uncle [[Jang Song-taek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/10750082/North-Korean-official-executed-by-flame-thrower.html|title= North Korean official 'executed by flame-thrower'|author=Julian Ryall|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2014/04/07/2014040700892.html|title=N.Korea Shuts Down Jang Song-taek's Department|publisher=Chosun Ilbo|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, analysts were surprised to find that top military general [[Ri Yong-gil]], believed by South Korea to have been executed earlier in the year, was, in fact, alive and well. According to the [[Associated Press]], this South Korean blunder highlights the difficulty even professionals have in piercing the veil of North Korea’s secretive regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ri Yong-gil, North Korean general thought to be executed, is actually alive|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/10/ri-yong-gil-north-korean-general-thought-be-execut/?page=all|accessdate=28 May 2016|work=The Washingtion Times|date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Kim Jong-un showed a change in cultural policy from his father by attending a [[Moranbong band|Moranbong]] concert.
