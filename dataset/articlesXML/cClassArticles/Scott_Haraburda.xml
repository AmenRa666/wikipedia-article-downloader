'''Scott Stanley Haraburda''' is an American soldier, engineer and inventor.  In addition to making key contributions to the development of [[heat exchangers]] and [[spacecraft propulsion]], he led a team of military officers in 2007 to [[Kuwait]] to correct many of the contingency contracting problems identified by the [[Gansler Commission]].  He is known nationally as the president of the Indiana Society of Professional Engineers who led the opposition to a state governmental panel recommendation in 2015 to eliminate licensing of engineers in [[Indiana]].

==Career==

===Military===

Colonel Scott S. Haraburda spent nearly three decades serving in the [[US Army]], providing significant contributions to [[military logistics]], [[CBRN defense|CBRNE defense]], and [[military science]].  In 1991 while he was teaching chemistry at the [[United States Military Academy]], the Army Astronaut Nomination Selection Board nominated Haraburda as a [[NASA Astronaut Corps#Members|NASA astronaut candidate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |first= Glen D. |last= Skirvin |recipient= Captain Scott S. Haraburda |subject= Army Astronaut Nomination Selection |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Army_Astronaut_Candidate_Nomination_Haraburda.pdf |date= 29 May 1991 |publisher= Department of the Army }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
A few years later by means of a competitive selection at the rank of Major, he served as a representative of the [[United States]] to [[Germany]] in 1995 through the ''Army Reserve’s Foreign Exchange Program'' with the [[Bundeswehr]], Germany’s army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Burbach, Mike | title = In step with an ally: Reservist eats, sleeps and trains with German army as part of exchange program | journal = [http://www.usar.army.mil/resources/Pages/WarriorCitizen.aspx Army Reserve Magazine] | volume = 41  | issue = 1  | pages = 20–21 | date = 1996 | quote= A combat support battalion at the [[Zweibrücken|Niederauerbach]] Kaserne (barracks) near the French border in southwestern Germany hosted Haraburda and four other Reservists.

Haraburda visited historical sites, including an abandoned bunker complex on the former [[Maginot Line]]. And various military installations and museums. At a maintenance facility, Haraburda sat in a submerged personnel carrier for 15 minutes during a leak test (a snorkel delivered fresh air).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, he served as the Executive Secretary of the [[Army Science Board]], helping its distinguished members of corporate [[Business executive|executive managers]], senior [[academia]]ns, and retired military [[flag officer]]s formulate recommendations to scientific and technological matters of concern to the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://asc.army.mil/docs/pubs/alt/2006/1_JanFebMar/articles/70_Army_Science_Board_200601.pdf | author=Haraburda, Scott S. |publication-date=2006 |year=2006 |title=Army Science Board — Providing More Than 50 Years of Scientific Advice and Guidance |volume=PB 70-06-01 |issue=January - February - March | periodical= Army AL&amp;T Magazine | pages=70–73 | accessdate= 3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military Logistics====
In late 2007, Colonel Haraburda deployed to [[Kuwait]] for a year to help correct the contingency contracting problems plaguing the [[Theater (warfare)|war zone]].  The Army deployed him to [[Camp Arifjan]] to lead a small military team of logistics officers in applying the [[LOGCAP]] methods as part of the [[Gansler Commission|Gansler Report's]] second recommendation solution.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|In early 2007, several problems involving contingency contracting surfaced, such as the problems that surrounded the high-visibility [[Cockerham bribery case]], along with the suicides of senior-level contracting and logistics professionals.

Contracts increased from $150 million in 2002 to nearly $1 billion in 2006, and are forecast to reach $1 billion in 2007, according to the secretary. While 20 military and civilian Army employees have been indicted on charges of contract fraud, Sec. Geren said the vast majority of Army contracting professionals fulfill operational requirements everyday for Soldiers serving in harm's way. |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This commission released what became known as the [[Gansler Commission|Gansler Report]] in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Commission on Army Acquisition and Program Management in Expeditionary Operations |url= https://acc.dau.mil/adl/en-US/180366/file/31657/Gansler%20Commission_Report_Final_Report_10-31-07.pdf |title= Urgent Reform Required: Army Expeditionary Contracting |publisher=Department of the Army |date=31 October 2007 | quote= [on page 5, the second key improvement needed was to] Restructure organization and restore responsibility to facilitate contracting and contract management in expeditionary and CONUS operations. |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second of the four key improvements involved the organizational restructure and change of responsibilities for contingency contracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Haraburda, Scott S. | author2 = Bloom, Frances A. | author3 = Keck, Robert T. | title = Contracting Agility in LOGCAP-Kuwait  | journal = Army Logistician  | volume = 41  | issue = 4  | pages = 3–8 | date = 2009 | url = http://www.alu.army.mil/alog/issues/JulAug09/pdf/alog_julaug09.pdf | quote= When Secretary Geren visited the Kuwait contracting office in September 2007, he was so impressed with the requirements generation process of the LOGCAP-Kuwait office that he directed that it be used for all requirements within Kuwait.

====CBRNE Defense====
As the commander of the 472d Chemical Battalion from 2002 through 2004 with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, he integrated his units’ training with civilian agencies, such as [[fire department]]s, [[police station]]s, [[hospital]]s, and [[Non-governmental|non-governmental organizations]] (i.e. [[American Red Cross]] to improve the [[Defense Support of Civil authorities|Defense Support of Civil Authorities]] capabilities for large-scale chemical defense missions.  As a result, he was the first commander selected to provide operational command and control over nearly 400 [[CBRN|Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and high- yield Explosives]] (CBRNE) defense soldiers in [[Operation Red Dragon (civil defense exercise)|Operation Red Dragon]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;retire&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Schuette, Rob | title = Red Dragon tests disaster response | journal= Triad | location= Fort McCoy, WI | date= 8 September 2006 | url = http://www.mccoy.army.mil/vtriad_online/09082006/Red_Dragon_Exercise_09-08-06.htm | quote= Red Dragon began as a small exercise at Fort McCoy in 2004 with 400 Soldiers, who were mostly with chemical organizations ...

Dr. Haraburda made significant contributions into optimizing the engineering designs of [[spacecraft propulsion]] and [[heat exchanger]]s.  In the early 1990s, he conducted research on a [[Ion thruster#Electromagnetic thrusters|Microwave Electrothermal Thruster]], to which he developed a simple equilibrium based theory of space-dependent parameters for transport design equations, using helium as the [[monatomic gas]] and nitrogen as the diatomic gas.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Applying the [[Finite Element Method]] (FEM) within the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] in a [[Batch reactor|Batch Reactor]] model of the TM&lt;sub&gt;011&lt;/sub&gt; and TM&lt;sub&gt;012&lt;/sub&gt; [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] resonance modes of a [[microwave cavity]], he predicted the residence time of the reaction to equilibrium.  With his data, he conducted many simulations on NASA's Two-Dimensional Kinetic (TDK) computer program to determine the effects on engine performance from pressure and energy changes along with propellant contamination.  He determined that one should use a minimum power of 1 kWatt to obtain [[specific impulse]]s greater than 1,000 lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;*sec/lb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| author= Haraburda Scott S.| title= Developmental Research for Designing a Microwave Electrothermal Thruster| booktitle= 18th Army Science Conference| volume= 2| pages = 15–29  | date= June 1992| location = Orlando, Florida| url = http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA259319  | accessdate= 24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| author= Haraburda, Scott S. | author2= Hawley, Martin C.| title= Investigations of Microwave Plasmas (Applications in Electrothermal Thruster Systems) | booktitle = 25th Joint Propulsion Conference | publisher= AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE | date= July 1989| location= Monterey, California| url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1989-2378| doi=10.2514/3.62304 | accessdate= 24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| author= Haraburda, Scott S. | author2= Hawley, Martin C.| title = Diagnostic Evaluations of Microwave Generated Helium and Nitrogen Plasma Mixtures | booktitle= 21st International Electric Propulsion Conference | publisher= AIAA/DGLR/JSASS | date = July 1990| location = Orlando, Florida| url= http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1990-2634| accessdate = 24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| author= Haraburda, Scott S. | author2= Hawley, Martin C.| author3= Dinkel, Duane W. | title = Diagnostic Evaluations of Microwave Generated Helium and Nitrogen Plasma Mixtures | booktitle = 21nd International Electric Propulsion Conference | publisher= AIDAA/AIAA/DGLR/JSASS | date = October 1991| location = Viareggio, Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| author= Haraburda, Scott S. | author2= Hawley, Martin C.| title = Theoretical Nozzle Performance of a Microwave Electrothermal Thruster Using Experimental Data | booktitle = 28th Joint Propulsion Conference | publisher= AIAA/SAE/ASME/ASEE | date = July 1992| location = Nashville, Tennessee| url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1992-3110  |  accessdate = 24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| author= Haraburda, Scott S. | author2= Hawley, Martin C.| author3= Asmussen, Jes | title = Review of Experimental and Theoretical Research on the Microwave Electrothermal Thruster | booktitle = 43rd Congress (World Space Congress) | publisher= International Astronautical Federation | date = September 1992| location = Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author= Nickerson, G.R. | author2= Dang, L.D. | author3= Coats, D.E. | title= Engineering and programming manual: Two-dimensional kinetic reference computer program (TDK) | publisher= NASA | url= http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19860007470.pdf | accessdate= 24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | type= Ph.D.  | last = Haraburda  | first = Scott S. | title= Transport phenomena of flow through helium and nitrogen plasmas in microwave electrothermal thrusters | publisher=Michigan State University | year = 2001 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/304703595 | accessdate =23 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also determined that fouling of the walls in the discharge chamber significantly reduces the amount of energy transferred to the propellant, thus reducing the rocket efficiencies.}}  In the mid-1990s, Dr. Haraburda also designed [[Heat exchanger#Helical-coil heat exchangers|Helical-coil heat exchangers]] for fluids with components in multiple phases (solids, liquids, and gases). {{refn|group=lower-alpha|Normal heat exchangers tend to create mechanical problems during operations, such as plugging of small-diameter tubes.&lt;ref name= haraburda&gt;{{cite journal  | author= Haraburda, Scott S. | title= Three-Phase Flow?

There are several simple methods for designing HCHE for all types of manufacturing industries, such as using the Ramachandra K.
