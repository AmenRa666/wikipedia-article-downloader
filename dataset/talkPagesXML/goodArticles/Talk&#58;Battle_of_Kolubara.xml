==Untitled==
A fine article, but you should mention the timely arrival of French artillery ammunition (75mm shells) and frentic attempts to shorten theese shells in time for the counterattack. This was done in Kragujevac war factory. The shells were 2mm too long (by some mistake) for Serbian guns. I think this was also an important factor in this victory.

== Neutrality Disputed Tag ==
The article contains de Neutrality Disputed Tag, but the Talk page does not show specific reasons for it. Please note  [[WP:NPOVD|NPOV Dispute]] policy, which strongly discourages driving-by tagging and recommends the disputes to be discussed on the talk page, pointing to specific issues. Since no such discussion is shown, I think it is fair to remove the tag. [[User:Mcampos69|M.Campos]] ([[User talk:Mcampos69|talk]]) 01:09, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
:It's hardly drive-by.  See my comment above.  I'd have thought even a cursory read of the article would make it clear that it is heavily slanted to the Serbian perspective.  If it`s really necessary, though I can go through it line by line and add tags.   If you want to make a contribution, identifying some quality references in English would be a big step forward. [[User:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog]] ([[User talk:LeadSongDog|talk]]) 04:34, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

Sorry, I did not intended to be offensive with &quot;driving by tagging&quot;. 

You are pointing at one major problem: the information are not sourced. 

I propose the following proceedure, which I believe matches fully the WP policies: if you have factual errors to point out, you may chalenge the information. The bourden of proof lays on whom placed the statement, and if no credible source is stated, you may remove the chalenged point. 

If you believe the problem are not factual errors, but the bias lays in emphasis given to specific points, or in language used (as often happens in controvertial articles), you are welcome to rewrite the text and present it here on talk page for discussion.  

I am afraid the line by line approach is the only way to have the article improved. Tagging is a kind of last resource when an agreement cannot be achieved, and is higly unsatisfactory to the reader.  If there is no discussion about in the talk page, he does not even have the opportunity to understand which are the disputed points. The whole text, even the parts that are correct stay under suspicion, being almost useless.

:Actually, I'm on the verge of putting it up for [[WP:AFD]].  As far as the article shows, it could be pure fiction and we wouldn't know.  The other-language articles are similarly unsourced or poorly sourced.  Have a look.[[User:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog]] ([[User talk:LeadSongDog|talk]]) 14:01, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

Well, if You don't know anything about this battle, how can You say it is POV? Yes, I'm a Serb, but I don't see what it is POV. However, it does require reliable sources. I have a book in Serbian about Serbian campaign in WWI, but it probably won't help. --[[User:BokicaK|&lt;font style=&quot;background: black&quot; face=&quot;Courier&quot; color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;Bojan&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:41, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

I don't want to rush to plaster &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cn}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; all through the article, but that may be the appropriate way to address its lack of attributions if nobody steps up to tackle it.

OK. I think you should place citation tags where they are necessary, then I will add the sources. OK? --[[User:BokicaK|&lt;font style=&quot;background: black&quot; face=&quot;Courier&quot; color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;Bojan&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 07:42, 16 July 2008 (UTC)
:I've made a start at it.  I see at ISBN 0760319375 an assertion of casualty figures (much as given on the article) were for the entire campaign, not just for this battle.

&lt;blockquote&gt;After the [[Battle of Cer]], the Serbian army retreated to the [[right bank]] of the [[Kolubara river]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We should expand this part of the article. After Battle of Cer, under pressure of Allies, inferior Serbian army crossed Sava river and underwent [[Srem]] operation. Serbs conquered Zemun, but final outcome of Srem operation was Serbian retreat. Then, Austrian and Serbian forces waged indecisive [http://www.srpskacrnja.com/mackov_kamen.htm Battle of Mačkov kamen]. In September 1914. Serbian and Montenegrin army attacked Bosnia and entered in Srebrenica, Han Pijesak, Glasinac. Montenegrin army even came near Sarajevo, but in October 1914. Austrians repeled both Serbian and Monenegrin armies back into their countries. From this point Battle of Kolubara begins. --[[User:BokicaK|&lt;font style=&quot;background: black&quot; face=&quot;Courier&quot; color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;Bojan&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:11, 16 July 2008 (UTC)

:This is getting circular.  The way the process works is first identify the sources, second verify their reliability, third include the content.  What we're trying to do is starting from step 3, going to work on step 1, and still haven't touched step 2.  It's made much worse by the fact that few if any of the sources have translations available into English, German, or Hungarian, any of which might help to reduce the skepticism as to their reliability or objectivity.  Here's a workable approach: in each citation add a quote=yadda yadda yadda (English: blah blah blah) 
At least this will reduce the difficulty in testing assertions.[[User:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog]] ([[User talk:LeadSongDog|talk]]) 19:37, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

m8, we(he) don't have any reason to question those books, as biased as that may sound... frankly, i've never encountered any(and i realy mean - ANY) source depicting this battle differently... i understand your concerns, but i don't beleive there's any need for it... first of all, i doubt that bokicak would cite any speculable book written in serbia, secondly, you're the one that's opposing the written history in serbian sources... wouldn't/shouldn't you be the one searching for sources of &quot;the other side&quot; or neutral ones(british, french, etc)? take care. --[[User talk:PrimEviL|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;P&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;rim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;L&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:48, 18 July 2008 (UTC)
:Look at it the other way.  A new reader comes along, sees the assertion, wants to learn more.  Where does (s)he go?  Even if averthing said was correct, this is supposed to be encyclopedic, meaning it should be a tertiary reference.  Without citations, it becomes primary, and wikipedia doesn't do primary.  (Lots of other places for that, including wikibooks.)  Anyhow, I've chased down a number of English sources.  See Further reading.

::it apears to me that you're trying to imply that BokicaK or myself have actualy participated WWI and this battle and we're trying to evocate our memories? :D seriously mate, everything i know about WWI(balcan warfare) is read from either history books in school(every history book in serbia is - as far as i know - written by a redeemed historian) or collection of biographies of 4serbian vojvodas(most notably the one about Zivojin Misic, the commander of the 1st army at the time) or, maybe, some other book... therefore, as far as i'm concerned, the neutrality of this article is hardly disputed, primarily because there is not a single thing that could be potentialy disptuted... your fear is simply based on the fact that the majority of the sources are serbian, but, let me ask you, don't you find that to be most natural thing? regards --[[User talk:PrimEviL|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;P&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;rim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;L&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:48, 19 July 2008 (UTC)
:::ROFL.  This isn't about fear.  In fact I have little sympathy with either side and don't much care what's said in the article if it meets encyclopedic standards. We are writing for a world-wide audience of English readers, not just for readers of Serbian in Serbia.  [[WP:V|Verifiability]] is a core policy, not a guideline.  All readers should be able to verify that what is said comes from [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].  They are not expected to learn a new language to do that.  We avoid relying on [[primary sources]] that may be difficult for readers to access (paper-only archival sources, etc.)  Just because you or I trust a source doesn't mean a specific reader does.  Indeed, the reader of wikipedia may not even know the source's publisher, let alone the author: why would they trust them? Please, just put your energy into making the article better.

::::I just consulted the &quot;World War I: Encyclopedia&quot;, by Tucker and Roberts, page 643, and I was able to confirm most of the information stated in the article. There were also some differences, which I revised according to that source. That book and the Popovic one cover near all the article content.  The only exception are the Potiorek plans after the fall of Belgrade, so the &quot;citation needed&quot; note remains there. If that specific information is chalenged, I will revise it or remove it. But the &quot;Unsourced Tag&quot; is no longer justified and I removed it. 
::::Popovic book in Serbian is a valid source. According to [[WP:NONENG]] (which is part of the very same [[WP:V]] mentioned above), the source in English is preffered (but not mandatory) &quot;assuming the availability of an English-language source of equal quality&quot;.  I am not aware of such source in English(and I had hard time searching for it), but if someone know it, and wish to revise the article according to it, he is always free to do it.
::::I think now we filled all the conditions to remove the &quot;POV tag&quot;. If someone desagrees, he is welcome to state his arguments. But please, be specific.

They are wrong! Austro-Hungarians lost that number of soldiers (KIA+WIA+MIA+POW) IN THE WHOLE 1914. which means they include losses at [[Battle of Cer]], and [[Battle of Drina]], the latter being a battle of similar size, or even biger than this battle, but less known in Serbia as it ended in a draw  (it encompasses all the actions after Cer that Bojan mentioned and more). And the number is from a Serbian source (Savo Skoko and Petar Opačić: Vojvoda Stepa Stepanović) that allegedly used an Austro-Hungarian source (Lezter Krieg by a group of Austrian authors) for their casualties (on the other hand, British historian Cyrill Falls puts them at ~ 215.000 for the whole year, but it is unclear where he got the number). In the whole 1914 the Serbs lost ~ 170.000 soldiers (all sources agree on this).
