== Quick comment ==

Just to note, the first German battlecruiser was {{SMS|Von der Tann}}, not the {{sclass|Moltke|battlecruiser|5}}s. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 02:34, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
:Thanks.  Laid down March 1908, launched March 1909, whereas the ''Moltkes'' were built 1909–1911. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 02:45, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
::Even if one ship isn't considered to constitute a class, I still think it's likely that someone reading quickly would be left with the impression that the ''Moltkes'' were the first battlecruisers, so I made the change. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 02:50, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

Another quick comment, pre-FAC: &quot;(BCS)&quot; probably shouldn't occur twice. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 23:51, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
:One in the lead and once in the main body. Is that a problem?--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 00:16, 14 September 2010 (UTC)
::Linking it twice isn't a problem for me and it's unlikely to be a problem for any reviewer (but no guaranties).  But we don't usually do initialisms or acronyms twice.  It would probably be better to lose the one in the lead. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 00:25, 14 September 2010 (UTC)
:::Okey-dokey!--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 00:29, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

== range ==

Just an observation  that the article quotes ships range at a speed of 10 knots. obviously we are limited by what information is available, but this is an unrealistically slow speed for operational conditions. Rnage would be significantly less at higher speeds. [[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] ([[User talk:Sandpiper|talk]]) 22:13, 30 October 2010 (UTC)

== The 4in secondary gun that was converted to High-Angle from Lion ==
&quot;The starboard after 4-inch (102 mm) gun was removed in early 1917,[13] fitted to a high-angle mount capable of 60° of elevation, and returned in April along with a second, similarly modified gun from Princess Royal's sister ship HMS Lion.[12]&quot;

Note 13 is to pg161 of Burt. That is correct as far as it goes.

Note 12 is creditted to pg83 of Roberts.

Neither author says the 4in gun removed from Lion was put in a High-Angle mount and installed on Princess Royal.

'''Where did that eminate?'''

[[User:Thru-a-hoop|Thru-a-hoop]] ([[User talk:Thru-a-hoop|talk]]) 23:11, 1 April 2013 (UTC)


'''It actually eminated from NJM Cambells 'Warship Special No1: Battlecruisers''''

If anyone is interested, the following is from p27-28 of the above title:

Princess Royal was constructed with four 3 pounder saluting guns, they were reduced to two by 1915 and by 1919 she had the original number of saluting guns back again.

For High-Angle Anti-Aircraft guns, Princess Royal was originally fitted with a Hotchkiss 6 pounder on a HA Mk1c mounting from Oct 1914 to Dec 1916.

A 3in 20cwt Mk1 HA gun was fitted from Jan 1915 to April 1917 when it was moved across to Lion, recieving in exchange one of Lions 4in secondary armament guns that had been fitted into a HA mount. This incoming 4in HA gun was to form a pair with a similar gun removed from Princess Royals secondary battery and put into a similar HA mount. These two 4in HA guns were fitted from April 1917 to May 1919 when they were replaced by a pair of 3in 20cwt Mk1.

Between June 1919 and March 1922, she was equipped with 2x 2 pounder Mk2 AA guns.
