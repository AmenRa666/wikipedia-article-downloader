The '''Kent Yeomanry''' was an [[artillery]] [[regiment]] of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] formed in 1920 by the amalgamation of the [[Royal East Kent Yeomanry|Royal East Kent (The Duke of Connaught's Own) Yeomanry (Mounted Rifles)]] and [[Queen's Own West Kent Yeomanry|West Kent Yeomanry (Queen's Own)]].  For the [[Second World War]] it was expanded to form two [[field artillery]] regiments&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; '''97th (Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery''' and '''143rd (Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; which saw active service in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] and North-West Europe, both with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|BEF]] in [[Battle of France|1940]] and on the [[Second Front]] in 1944–45.  Post war it was reconstituted as '''297th (Kent Yeomanry) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''' before being amalgamated in 1961 with the [[3rd/4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)]] to form the [[Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry]].

==History==

==={{anchor|6RFA|97RFA}}Formation===
Following the experience of the [[First World War]], it was decided that only the fourteen most senior [[yeomanry]] [[regiment]]s would be retained as horsed cavalry,&lt;ref name=Mileham48&gt;{{harvnb|Mileham|1994|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the rest being transferred to other roles.&lt;ref name=Mileham50&gt;{{harvnb|Mileham|1994|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, on 20 August 1920, the [[Royal East Kent Yeomanry|Royal East Kent (The Duke of Connaught's Own) Yeomanry (Mounted Rifles)]]&lt;ref name=MillsEKY&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715140005/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vcav/kentE.htm |date=15 July 2007 |title=Royal East Kent Yeomanry (The Duke of Connaught's Own) (Mounted Rifles) at regiments.org by T.F.Mills }}&lt;/ref&gt; was amalgamated with the [[Queen's Own West Kent Yeomanry|West Kent Yeomanry (Queen's Own)]]&lt;ref name=MillsWKY&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715140005/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vcav/kentW.htm |date=15 July 2007 |title=West Kent Yeomanry (Queen's Own) at regiments.org by T.F.Mills }}&lt;/ref&gt; to form the Kent Yeomanry and simultaneously re-roled as [[field artillery]] to form ''6th (Kent) Army Brigade, [[Royal Field Artillery|RFA]]''.&lt;ref name=MillsKY&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715140005/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vcav/kentYeo.htm |date=15 July 2007 |title=Kent Yeomanry at regiments.org by T.F.Mills }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 the regiment regained its yeomanry title and was renumbered as the ''97th (Kent Yeomanry) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery''.  Within the brigade, two [[Artillery battery|batteries]] were subtitled &quot;Duke of Connaught's Own Yeomanry&quot;{{snd}}385th at [[Canterbury]] and 386th at [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]]{{snd}}and two were subtitled &quot;Queen's Own Yeomanry&quot;{{snd}}387th at [[Bromley]] and 388th at [[Maidstone]].  The regiment's [[Headquarters#Military|HQ]] was also at Maidstone.&lt;ref name=MillsKY/&gt;  Another title change came in June 1924 as the [[Royal Field Artillery]] was reamalgamated back into the [[Royal Artillery]] and the regiment became ''97th (Kent Yeomanry) Field Brigade, RA''.  The final change came in 1938 as artillery [[brigades#United Kingdom|brigades]] became regiments, and the unit became ''97th (Kent Yeomanry) Army Field Regiment, RA'' in November.&lt;ref name=Frederick3435&gt;{{harvnb|Frederick|1984|pp=34&amp;ndash;35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1939 it became clear that a new European war was likely to break out, and the doubling of the Territorial Army was authorised, with each unit forming a duplicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.army.mod.uk/reserve/31793.aspx | title=History of the Army Reserve | publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]] | accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  97th (Kent Yeomanry) Army Field Regiment, RA formed 143rd Field Regiment, RA.&lt;ref name=MillsKY/&gt;  The new regiment continued the tradition of including batteries from both East and West Kent.&lt;ref name=Mileham91&gt;{{harvnb|Mileham|1994|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===

===={{anchor|97th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery}} 97th (Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery====
97th (Kent Yeomanry) Army Field Regiment mobilized on 3 September 1939 at Maidstone under [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Command]] with 385th (Duke of Connaught's Own Yeomanry) and 387th (Queen's Own Yeomanry) Batteries.&lt;ref name=RA97&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/field/page97.html | title=97 (Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment RA(TA) | publisher=The Royal Artillery 1939-45 | first=Derek | last=Barton | accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regiment joined the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|BEF]] in May 1940, initially with [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]]&lt;ref name=RA97/&gt; then with the [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref name=Joslen47&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Battle of France]], the regiment saw action at [[Saint-Valery-en-Caux]] in June 1940; after the German advance the regiment destroyed its guns and equipment and headed to [[Dunkirk]] for evacuation in [[Operation Dynamo]].&lt;ref name=Kentfallen&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kentfallen.com/PDF%20REPORTS/97th%20KENT%20YEOMANRY%20R.A.pdf | title=97th (Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment Royal Artillery | accessdate=7 May 2014 | publisher=Kent War Memorials Transcription Project | first1=David W | last1=Hughes | first2=Neil R | last2=Clark | first3=Kyle D | last3=Tallett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Field regiments had been organised in 1938 into two 12-gun batteries.  The experience of the BEF in 1940 showed the problem with this organisation: field regiments were intended to support an infantry brigade of three battalions.  This could not be managed without severe disruption to the regiment.  As a result, field regiments were reorganised into three 8-gun batteries.&lt;ref name=Forty73&gt;{{harvnb|Forty|1998|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third battery (470th) was formed in the regiment at [[Great Baddow]] in March 1941.&lt;ref name=Frederick525&gt;{{harvnb|Frederick|1984|p=525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regiment arrived in [[Iraq]] on 20 October 1941 and was initially under command of [[Tenth Army (United Kingdom)|Tenth Army]] before being assigned to [[10th Indian Infantry Division]] on 19 November.  On 25 April 1942, 470th Battery left to form part of X (later 164th) Field Regt, RA.  The rest of the regiment arrived in [[Egypt]] with the division on 31 May.  On 5 July it came under command of [[British Troops in Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Joslen505&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=505}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The regiment dropped the &quot;Army&quot; designation on 13 September&lt;ref name=Frederick525/&gt; and on the same date joined the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]].&lt;ref name=Joslen19&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Armed with sixteen [[25 pounder]]s,&lt;ref name=Joslen569&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; the regiment served with 7th Armoured in the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]].&lt;ref name=Joslen21&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 December it was placed under command of GHQ, [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]]&lt;ref name=Joslen483&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=483}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 470th Battery was reformed for the regiment.&lt;ref name=Frederick525/&gt;

In October 1943 it rejoined the 10th Indian Division,{{efn|Kempton does not support this assertion&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kempton|2003a|pp=65&amp;ndash;73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joslen states that the regiment ceased to be under command of Indian Formations on 5 July 1942.&lt;ref name=Joslen505/&gt;}} serving in North Africa, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Italy]], where it ended the war on the Adriatic coast near [[Trieste]].&lt;ref name=RA97/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kentfallen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bellis96&gt;{{harvnb|Bellis|1995|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regimental HQ with 385th, 387th and 470th Batteries were placed in suspended animation{{efn|name=SA|&quot;suspended animation&quot; describes units that continued to exist but without personnel or equipment.&lt;ref name=Bellis8&gt;{{harvnb|Bellis|1994|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} on 15 December 1945.&lt;ref name=Frederick525/&gt;

===={{anchor|143rd Field Regiment, Royal Artillery}} 143rd (Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery====
143rd Field Regiment mobilized on 3 September 1939 at Ashford under [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Command]] with 386th (Duke of Connaught's Own Yeomanry) and 388th (Queen's Own Yeomanry) Batteries.&lt;ref name=RA143&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/field/page143.html | title=143 (Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment RA(TA) | publisher=The Royal Artillery 1939-45 | first=Derek | last=Barton | accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spent the early part of the war in [[Iceland in World War II|Iceland]]. While there, it was reorganised from two 12-gun batteries to three 8-gun batteries when the third battery (507th) was formed in the regiment in May 1941. It was authorised to use the &quot;Kent Yeomanry&quot; designation from 17 February 1942.&lt;ref name=Frederick533&gt;{{harvnb|Frederick|1984|p=533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving back in the UK, the regiment was assigned to the [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]], ''the Polar Bears'', on 26 April 1942; it was to remain with the division for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=Joslen79&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bellis102&gt;{{harvnb|Bellis|1995|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division began landing in [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy]] on 12 June 1944 ([[Normandy landings|D-Day]]) + 6)&lt;ref name=Joslen80&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in the [[North-West Europe Campaign of 1944–1945|North-West Europe Campaign]].&lt;ref name=RA143/&gt;  The regiment gave support to the British and Canadian forces attacking [[Battle for Caen|Caen]] ([[Operation Martlet|First]] and [[Second Battle of the Odon]]).&lt;ref name=Joslen80/&gt; They were also in action around [[Le Havre]] as part of the [[First Canadian Army]], at the [[Turnhout Canal]]&lt;ref name=Kentfallen/&gt; and in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]].&lt;ref name=Joslen80/&gt; The winter of 1944-1945 was spent on the Dutch - German border along the River [[Meuse River|Maas]]. Their final action was at [[Liberation of Arnhem|Second Battle of Arnhem]] in April 1945.&lt;ref name=Kentfallen/&gt;

The Regiment was placed in suspended animation after the war {{efn|name=SA}} on 18 April 1946 and was disbanded on 1 January 1947.&lt;ref name=Frederick533/&gt;

==Battle Honours==
The Kent Yeomanry was the custodian of the [[battle honour]]s of The Royal East Kent Mounted Rifles (The Duke of Connaught's Own) and The West Kent Yeomanry (Queen's Own).&lt;ref name=MillsKY/&gt;{{efn|These were:

The Royal Artillery was present in nearly all battles and would have earned most of the honours awarded to cavalry and infantry regiments.
