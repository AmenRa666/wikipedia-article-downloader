== Suggestions ==
G'day, good work so far with this article. Although it is currently rated start class, I think it wouldn't need too much work to bring it up to GA-class. The main things that I think would be required to bring it up to GA are as follows:
* inline citations: at a minimum, each paragraph should end with an in-line citation that details where the information came from;
* reference base: currently it appears that only one reference has been consulted (Loughnan). While it is to be expected that that work would provide the majority of citations, I think for the sake of balance, a few extra works should also be consulted ;
* images: while it is not strictly a GA requirement, the article would certainly benefit from the addition of a few, if only to break up the text. There may be some on Commons, or some in the Loughan reference. Of course, we need to be careful to abide by copyright rules, though. 
* if you would like a hand or want some advice, I'd be happy to try to help. Thanks for your efforts so far. Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 01:39, 27 August 2015 (UTC)

There's an image here, but it needs permissions. http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/new-zealand-divisional-cavalry-units-italy --[[User:Kges1901|Kges1901]] ([[User talk:Kges1901|talk]]) 09:03, 27 August 2015 (UTC)
:I gave the references a bit of a tidy up. There are unreferenced paragraphs; if this can be addressed, the article would at least be B class. '''&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;[[User:Schwede66|Schwede]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF4500&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Schwede66|66]]&lt;/font&gt;''' 09:22, 27 January 2016 (UTC)
:: These seem to have been added now, good work. I've reassessed as B class now. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 00:24, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
{{od}} G'day, good work with improving this article. Per the post on my talk page, I have a couple of suggestions that you might consider prior to GA: [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 09:43, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
* expansion of the lead: preferably two decent paragraphs for an article this long;
* images: if possible, I would try to add an iconic image to the infobox, and then another in the Italian section to break up the text a bit more. Additionally, some of them could be left aligned to offset the right aligned images;
* copy edit: I think the text needs a bit of a run through with a copy editor's eye. I'd suggest posting it at [[WP:GOCE]];
* spelling: as a New Zealand article it should probably use NZ/British English variation rather than US. So for instance, &quot;maneuvers&quot; --&gt; &quot;manoeuvres &quot; (there are possibly other examples also)
* context: in a few places it would help the reader to explain why movements occurred etc. For instance: 
**&quot;C Squadron completed training in New Zealand and arrived in Britain&quot; --&gt; perhaps it could be said why they were sent to Britain. I assume it was to help defend against a possible German invasion?
**&quot;The regiment embarked for Greece...&quot; --&gt; as above, why were they sent there? I assume it was because a German invasion was expected and the Allies had pledged to help defend Greece
**&quot;On the 17th, Bernard Freyberg decided...&quot; explain who Freyberg was, and include his rank
* in the References, is there an oclc number for the McClymont work?

:Did a ce of the lead and first section, tidied references but left the spellings etc alone. Can anyone point to a NZEng guide pls? Feel free to revert as desired; will continue ce later. Regards [[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 13:52, 23 July 2016 (UTC)
::Finished ce, revert as desired. Regards [[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 16:49, 25 July 2016 (UTC)

== &quot;known as Div Cav&quot; ==

The article notes that the Divisional Cavalry Regiment was &quot;known as Div Cav&quot;. Not really. &quot;Div Cav&quot; is just an abbreviation. It's like saying President Obama &quot;was known as Mr.&quot; and then using &quot;MR&quot; in place of his name.[[Special:Contributions/68.146.140.188|68.146.140.188]] ([[User talk:68.146.140.188|talk]]) 15:28, 20 November 2016 (UTC)</text>
