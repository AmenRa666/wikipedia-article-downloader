== POV ==
This article is very partial on the objectives of France in this operation. First it was not an all French mission, as troops from Senegal, Mauretania, Niger, Chad, Guniea-Bissau and Congo participated. Second it is a someone's personal opinion as the ulterior motives of France are concerned. If France wanted to stop RPF, it would have been an easy task to intervene with air strikes on RPF positions as president [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] asked for; but this was denied. The main problem during this operation was that French forces that were in Rwanda for military cooperation with Rwandan forces were then ask to take a more neutral stance, if other countries had the gut to do this operation the situation may have been different; but here it is no-one else was willing to do something to stop the massacres. There certainly was some massacres inside the Turquoise neutral zone, but overall a lot of lives have been saved regardless of their ethnic origin.&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Blastwizard |Blastwizard ]] ([[User talk:Blastwizard |talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Blastwizard |contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
:Operation &quot;Turquoise&quot; officially was intended to create a secure perimeter in Rwanda, but its informal purposes were to prevent RPF to gain infuence and power in the country. The Foreign Affairs responsible of the RPF decleared that the french troops in Rwanda will not ipmrove the situation. He said at the time that frecnh troops came for the same reason in 1990 and took them long years to leave the country. [[User:Floreen|Floreen]] 14:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

==French intervention==
The French Intervention does not mean that they had guts. They were there to support the Hutu perpetrators of the Genocide. The Rwandan Patriotic Front is the army that had guts, becuase they had no help from any country, and they single handedly stopped the genocide without any major intervention. Remember, the Rwandan Patritic Front had to face the &quot;entire&quot; Hutu genocidal government and extremists who were supported by France. By defeating the Hutu Extremists, the Rwandan Patriotic Front was technically defeating the French who supported the Hutu killers. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:129.89.133.147|129.89.133.147]] ([[User talk:129.89.133.147|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/129.89.133.147|contribs]]) 11 February 2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

&quot;The Rwandan Patriotic Front is the army that had guts, becuase they had no help from any country, and they single handedly stopped the genocide without any major intervention.&quot; Hum, The RPF was supported by Burundi... True they stopped this genocide but they started another one after, look at the situation in the eastern part of Congo today...

==RPF support==
The RPF must have had support. OK, some (4,000) were trained in Uganda and fought in the Ugandan Bush war.( so the article on the Rwanda civil states). However to keep fighting from 1990 to 1994 requires serious funding from some government/corporation. 
Paul Kagame himself was trained at the Command and General Staff College (C&amp;GSC) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas - check the Wikipedia article - Command and General Staff College -.
This leads me to conclude that the RPF were at least partially funded by the US.
Further discussion is welcome. -tk-

== Canada ==
I have removed the contribution
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was also 22 2CDO canadian airborne regiment there, fully combat capable but under orders not to participate in suppression. Furthermore, they were prohibited from taking out the radio stations and the communications in the area. It is unknown what would have happened if the radio stations would have been taken off the air.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
from the article.  It seems both tangential to the topic of the article and speculative. - [[User:BanyanTree|Banyan]][[User talk:BanyanTree|Tree]] 00:25, 30 September 2008 (UTC)</text>
