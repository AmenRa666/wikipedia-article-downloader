== Location ==

There is a problem with the way the coordinates have been added to this page. Can anyone help, please?--[[User:RoslynSKP|RoslynSKP]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 06:51, 26 August 2010 (UTC)

:I now realise its a problem with the coordinates I added. They are wrong but I don't know how to fix them.--[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 06:25, 11 September 2010 (UTC) 

::I have cut the following sentence because it relates to the Magdhaba engagement - 'The commander of the [[British Desert Column|Desert Column]], Lieutenant General [[Philip Chetwode]], who had arrived the day before accompanied [[Anzac Mounted Division]] as observer.'--[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 03:57, 8 September 2010 (UTC)
:::all fixed!--[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 05:26, 15 September 2010 (UTC)
::::The location was south of [[Sheikh Zuweid]] which is wrong. I fixed it to the right place.[[User:Tushyk|Tushyk]] ([[User talk:Tushyk|talk]]) 10:00, 27 January 2014 (UTC)

== Strength and Turkish leaders ==

Sirs, I have the following comments about the article:

1) About strengths: how many soldiers were in those five British mounted brigades?
I have an impression that the British and New Zealanders were actually outnumbered,
but maybe just the opposite was true?
2) Is it really impossible to establish who was the commander on the Turkish side?
3) It seems to me that the article is a little bit overenthusiastic as if written
to the glory of New Zealand's soldiers. I have absolutely no doubts about their valour,
but it seems to me that an encyclopaedic article should be, so to say, more dry and sober.

I hope that my comments do not appear meaningless to you.
Sincerely yours,
[[User:Kosmaty|Kosmaty]] ([[User talk:Kosmaty|talk]]) 23:53, 9 January 2011 (UTC)

:Thank you for your comments. I'm sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you, but I've been away.
# It appears from Falls the official British historian that the Ottoman 31st Regiment (2nd Division) supported by one mountain battery fought against the 3 light horse brigades and the Camel Corps; and that 1,635 prisoners were captured. 
# The overall commander of the force which attacked Romani was Kress von Kressenstein although the regimental commander is not known.
# I agree that this article needs to be substantially re-edited and although the New Zealanders were particularly effective in this engagement the article must be neutral in tone before gaining good article status.

Thank you for your interest.--[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 03:19, 11 November 2011 (UTC)

== Captured what? ==

&quot;They encountered a Bedouin camel patrol {{convert|spell=in|.5|mi|km}} from Sheikh Zowaiid, which was captured.&quot; This is unclear. Did they capture the camel patrol or Sheike Zowaiid? [[User:Folklore1|Folklore1]] ([[User talk:Folklore1|talk]]) 18:07, 3 October 2013 (UTC)
:Thanks have added clarification. --[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 03:35, 4 October 2013 (UTC)

{{Talk:Battle of Rafa/GA1}}

== Map cut ==

A map has been cut which showed the geo-political territorial zones within the region. Given that this battle invaded the opposition's territory, this map provides important context. --[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 22:50, 21 January 2014 (UTC)

== Downes cut ==

Although the GAR calls for the two Downes quotes to be paraphrased they have been cut altogether. This is despite them both giving details about the complex evacuation of the wounded after fighting many miles in advance. --[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 22:54, 21 January 2014 (UTC)

== Citation cut ==

&quot;These successful attacks were supported by aircraft, which bombed the redoubts and trenches. The aircraft had recently been fitted with wireless (they had to drop messages during the Magdhaba attack in December), and during the afternoon reported progress to Desert Column headquarters.&quot; [Cutlack 1941 pp. 49–51, Falls 1930 Vol. p. 254, Anzac Mounted Division War Diary Appendix 24, pp. 3–8 AWM4-1-60-10] The citation to the War Diary has been cut from the article. However, the editor has left most of the information without checking what came from the war diary and what came from the two other sources which are still cited. --[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 23:04, 21 January 2014 (UTC)</text>
