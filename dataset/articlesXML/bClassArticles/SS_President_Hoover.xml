'''SS ''President Hoover''''' was a [[Dollar Steamship Lines]] [[ocean liner]]. She was completed in 1930 and provided a trans-Pacific service between the USA and the Far East. In 1937 she ran aground on an island off [[Taiwan]] and was declared a total loss. She had a [[sister ship]], {{SS|President Coolidge||2}}, that was completed in 1931, was made a [[troopship]] in 1941 and was lost in 1942.

==Building==
Dollar Lines ordered both ships on 26 October 1929.&lt;ref name=Takao1/&gt; The [[Newport News Shipbuilding]] and Drydock Company of [[Newport News, Virginia]], USA built the two ships, completing ''President Hoover'' in 1930 and ''President Coolidge'' in 1931.&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; They were the largest merchant ships built in the USA up to that time.&lt;ref name=HHPLM/&gt; [[First Lady]] [[Lou Henry Hoover]] launched and christened ''Hoover'' on December 9, 1930.&lt;ref name=Takao1/&gt;&lt;ref name=HHPLM/&gt;

Each ship had [[turbo-electric transmission]], with a pair of steam [[turbo generator]]s generating current that powered propulsion motors on the twin [[Propeller (marine)|propeller]] shafts. [[General Electric]] built the turbo generators and propulsion motors for ''Coolidge'' but [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] built the turbo generators and propulsion motors for ''Hoover''.&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; 12 oil-fired [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] high-pressure boilers supplied the steam for ''Hoover''{{'}}s turbo-generators.&lt;ref name=Takao1/&gt; The electric propulsion motors produced 26,500 [[Horsepower#Shaft horsepower|shp]] at 133 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]].&lt;ref name=Takao1/&gt;

{{Rquote|left|This ship is a wonder.|[[Robert Dollar]]|August 6, 1931}}
''Hoover''{{'}}s accommodation was air conditioned&lt;ref name=Takao1/&gt; and there was a 'phone in every cabin.&lt;ref name=APL-Style/&gt; There were swimming pools on deck,&lt;ref name=APL-Style/&gt; gymnasiums,&lt;ref name=APL-Style/&gt; a dance floor&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; and [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis elevators]].&lt;ref name=Takao1/&gt; Décor was in contemporary [[Art Deco]] style and the First Class lounge was decorated with murals by the artist Frank Bergman of New York.&lt;ref name=Takao1/&gt;

[[Robert Dollar]] had bought his first ship in 1895, founded Dollar Lines in 1903 and was now 87 years old. On August 6, 1931, three days before ''Hoover'' was launched, he toured her and declared ''&quot;This ship is a wonder&quot;''.&lt;ref name=Takao1/&gt;&lt;ref name=APL-Style/&gt; Dollar lived until May 1932, just a few months after ''Hoover'' and ''Coolidge'' made their [[maiden voyage]]s.

==Trans-Pacific service==
''Hoover'' and ''Coolidge'' ran between [[San Francisco]] and [[Manila]] ''via'' Japan and China.&lt;ref name=HHPLM/&gt; The [[United States Postal Service]] subsidised them to carry mail, which helped Dollar to run the two ships at a profit.&lt;ref name=HHPLM/&gt;

However, the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931–32, the [[Defense of the Great Wall|Japanese attack on the Great Wall]] in 1933 and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] starting in July 1937 all deterred US travel to the Far East, and Dollar Lines became increasingly unprofitable.&lt;ref name=HHPLM/&gt;

==Bombed in the Yangtze River==
After the [[Battle of Shanghai]] had broken out in August 1937, ''President Hoover'' was diverted from [[Hong Kong]] to evacuate US nationals from [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/Hoover_t.htm |last1=Tully |first1=Anthony |last2=Hackett |first2=Bob |last3=Kingsepp |first3=Sander |title=Stranding of S.S. PRESIDENT HOOVER – December 1937 |series=''Rising Storm'' – The Imperial Japanese Navy and China 1931–1941 |publisher=Imperial Japanese Navy Page |year=2012 |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was moored in the [[Yangtze River]], awaiting clearance to enter the [[Suzhou Creek|Wusong River]]&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; to reach the [[Port of Shanghai]] when, despite a {{convert|30|ft|sing=on}}-long&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; US flag draped on her top deck abaft the bridge&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; to identify her to aircraft as a neutral US ship, the [[Republic of China Air Force]] mistook her for the Japanese [[troopship]] ''[[Asama Maru]]'' and bombed her.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF-Shanghai&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/Marco_t.htm |last1=Hackett |first1=Bob |last2=Kingsepp |first2=Sander |last3=Tully |first3=Anthony |title=The Beginning of The Second Sino-Japanese War – &quot;The Marco Polo Bridge Incident&quot; and the Fall of Peiping and Shanghai – 1937 |series=''Rising Storm'' – The Imperial Japanese Navy and China 1931–1941 |publisher=Imperial Japanese Navy Page |year=2012 |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One bomb hit ''Hoover''{{'}}s top deck, killing a crewman from the mess hall.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; Fragments from another bomb penetrated the main saloon, wounding six crew and two passengers.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; One of ''Hoover''{{'}}s radio officers transmitted a distress call stating that Chinese aircraft were attacking her.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; Both an [[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]] destroyer and a [[Royal Navy]] cruiser came in response, but in the event only medical help was needed.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; Different sources date the incident as 14&lt;ref name=CF-Shanghai/&gt; or 30&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 1937|title=The inexperience of Chinese airmen... |journal=The China Journal |volume=XXVII |issue=3 |url= http://www.takaoclub.com/hoover/wreck.htm |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; August. Despite her casualties ''Hoover'' sustained only minor damage, but she aborted the rescue mission to Shanghai&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; and returned to San Francisco for repairs.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;

[[Chiang Kai-shek]], leader of China's [[Military Affairs Commission|National Military Commission]], had known Robert Dollar and was reportedly furious that his aircraft had attacked his late friend's ship.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; He threatened to have the officer responsible executed until he found that it was his chief air force advisor [[Claire Lee Chennault]].&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; Chiang's wife [[Soong Mei-ling]] had hired Chennault only two months previously, and the Generalissimo relented and instead paid the Texan a $10,000 bonus soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;

==Aground on Kasho-to==
After repairs ''Hoover'' returned to service, departing from San Francisco on 22 November 1937&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; for [[Port of Kobe|Kobe]] and [[Port of Manila|Manila]].&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; She was barely more than half-full, with only 503 passengers.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; During the voyage the Dollar Lines management signaled ''Hoover''{{'}}s [[Sea captain|Master]], George W Yardley, ''&quot;You must be in Manila, absolutely urgent that you arrive not later than 6 a.m. 12th December,&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; make all possible speed&quot;''.&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt;

''Hoover''{{'}}s course from Kobe to Manila avoided Hong Kong, Shanghai and the [[Taiwan Strait]] in order to keep clear of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] zone.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; Instead ''Hoover'' took an unfamiliar course down the east coast of [[Taiwan]],&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; which since 1895 had been [[Japanese rule in Taiwan#Dōka: &quot;Integration&quot; (1915-1937) (1915-1937)|under Japanese rule]]. The Japanese colonial authorities had turned off the [[List of lighthouses in Taiwan|lighthouses in Taiwan]] so ''Hoover'' navigated by [[dead reckoning]].&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; A strong [[monsoon]] blowing from the northeast made it difficult to calculate her course accurately,&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; and a heavy mist made visibility extremely poor.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;

}}
At about 0100 hrs on 11 December&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; (local date) ''Hoover'' struck a reef about {{convert|500|m}}&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; from the shore of Zhongliao Bay&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; on the north coast of [[Green Island, Taiwan|Kasho-to]] (綠島),&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; a [[High island|volcanic island]] about {{convert|18|nmi|km}} off [[Taitung City]] in south-eastern Taiwan. Her bottom was torn open as far aft as her [[engine room]]&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; and she came to rest with a slight list to [[Port and starboard|port]].&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; At about 0200 hrs&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; ''Hoover'' fired [[Flare gun|distress flares]] and her radio officer sent an [[SOS]] signal.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; The [[Hamburg America Line]] cargo ship [[SS Preußen (1922)|D/S ''Preußen'']] received the SOS and arrived around dawn, but the heavy sea&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; and shallow water&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; prevented her from approaching close enough to help.

Captain Yardley tried at first to refloat the ship by having the crew jettison cargo and [[Fuel oil#Bunker fuel|bunker oil]] overboard.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; Thick black [[Fuel oil#Bunker fuel|fuel oil]] spread over the sea and onto the beach,&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; either deliberately discharged&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; or through the reef damaging the ship's bunkers. But as the monsoon continued to blow from the northeast, and lightening ''Hoover'' only helped the wind and strong waves to drive her further onto the reef until she was only {{convert|100|m}} from shore.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;

A junior member of the [[Purser]]'s department, Eugene Lukes, recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''...the general alarms went off, and we were getting all the passengers out, getting everybody up on deck. It was blowing, the seas were starting to smack against the side of the ship, it was pitch black. And pretty soon we could see little bobbing lights along the shoreline, little oil lanterns so we obviously stirred up the natives. As it got lighter we could see that we had ripped out the bottom almost clear back to the engine room. There was a lot of oil, and it oiled the sea and the beach. There was no backing off, so we had to get the passengers ashore. We lowered the lifeboats with people in them.''&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the villagers of Zhongliao fled to the mountains because at the sight of ''Hoover'' close to shore, and the sound and sight of her distress flares, they feared that the Sino-Japanese fighting had reached their island.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; With the dawn, villagers realised what had really happened, and put to sea in motor fishing boats to help.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt;

===Abandoning the ship===
''Hoover''{{'}}s crew prepared to evacuate passengers.&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; In order to keep boats on course between the ship and the shore in the monsoon wind, they put a wire cable ashore and tautened it with a winch aboard ship.&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; In each boat two crewmen wearing strong gloves, one each in the bow and the stern, would slide their hands along the cable to guide boats from ship to shore.&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; Some passengers alleged that ''Hoover''{{'}}s crew were inexperienced, and that when trying to get the wire cable ashore to prepare for the evacuation they capsized two of the lifeboats in shallow water.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758770,00.html |title=The Hoover Affair |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=27 December 1937 |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ashigara.jpg|thumb|The {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Ashigara}} helped to transfer survivors from [[Green Island, Taiwan|Kasho-to]] to [[USS J. Franklin Bell (APA-16)|''President McKinley'']] and [[USS Hugh L. Scott (AP-43)|''President Pierce'']]]]
At low tide around 1300 hrs Yardley ordered the evacuation of the passengers.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; ''Hoover''{{'}}s crew lowered her [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], villagers approached with their boats and both ferried passengers ashore.&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; It took about 15 minutes for a boat to make each trip along the cable from ship to shore.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; Because of the black oil on the water, some of the women passengers were reluctant to step from the lifeboats to wade ashore, so crewmen carried them.&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; At about 1500 hrs the flagship of the [[4th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Japanese 4th Fleet]], the {{sclass|Myōkō|cruiser}} {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Ashigara||2}} arrived with an unidentified {{sclass|Mutsuki|destroyer}} to observe and protect ''Hoover''.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; It took 36 hours from the line being secured to the last passenger being brought ashore.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;

No lives were lost, but some passengers suffered [[hypothermia]] in the December wind and cold and were treated by the [[ship's doctor]].&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; From where they landed the survivors had to walk about {{convert|2|mi|0}} to Zhongliao village.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; There as many as possible were accommodated in the village school, with the remainder being distributed to villagers' houses.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', while the passengers were being taken ashore a small number&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; of the crewmen aboard ''Hoover'' plundered the ship's liquor supply.&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''According to Dr. Claude Conrad, a missionary official of Washington, D. C.: &quot;A majority of the ship's crew came into camp more or less incapacitated and abusive from the effects of free indulgence in the ship's liquor stores. Out of control of officers partially in the same condition, many of the crew men continued most of the night terrorizing passengers and natives.&quot; However, when the liquored seamen began hunting for women passengers sleeping in scattered houses ashore, some officers and other passengers formed a vigilante group to protect them. There was no actual molestation. There would have been no disturbance at all ashore, said some of the passengers, if the Hoover's officers had been permitted by Japanese police to land with their guns.''&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other witnesses reported that some of the passengers also got drunk.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;

===Repatriation from Kasho-to===

The [[United States Navy|US Navy]] had sent two {{sclass-|Clemson|destroyer|2}}s to help: {{USS|Alden|DD-211|6}} from Manila and {{USS|Barker|DD-213|6}} from [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Olongapo Naval Station]].&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; However, in the heavy sea they made only {{convert|12|kn|km/h}} and did not arrive until 1245 hrs the next day, 12 December.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; A Japanese officer from ''Ashigara'' boarded ''Alden'' and cleared the two US warships to enter Japanese [[territorial waters]].&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; ''Alden'' sent a party of two officers and 15 enlisted men aboard ''Hoover'' to secure her [[Coin|specie]] vault, whose contents included [[registered mail]] and other valuables, and both destroyers sent landing parties ashore to restore order among the survivors.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;

On 12 December at about 1500 hrs a Japanese cargo ship, ''Toriyama Maru'', arrived to deliver food and other necessities to the survivors.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; On 13 December [[American Mail Line]]'s [[USS J. Franklin Bell (APA-16)|''President McKinley'']] arrived offshore.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt;

On the morning of 14 December news reached ''Alden'' and ''Barker'' that two days earlier Japanese aircraft had [[USS Panay incident|sunk the US gunboat USS ''Panay'']] in the Yangtze River near [[Nanjing]].&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; ''Alden'' and ''Barker'' discreetly prepared racks of ammunition for their [[4&quot;/50 caliber gun]]s, but the IJN ships continued to stand by and assist.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; ''McKinley'' moved closer inshore and embarked about 400 of ''Hoover''{{'}}s passengers and about 230 of her crew.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; Japanese Navy flat-bottomed boats brought them from the shore out to meet ''McKinley''{{'}}s boats and a motor launch, which then ferried them out to the liner.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; ''McKinley'' then left for Manila, leaving behind ''Hoover''{{'}}s officers, [[steerage]] passengers and the last 100 of her crew on Kasho-to.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;

On 15 December Dollar Lines' [[USS Hugh L. Scott (AP-43)|''President Pierce'']] arrived and rescued ''Hoover''{{'}}s steerage passengers, officers and remainder of her crew.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;&lt;ref name=APL-Memoirs/&gt; USS ''Alden'' remained guarding the wreck until 23 December, when the Japanese authorities took over.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;

Many failed attempts were made to rescue the ship.&lt;ref name=HHPLM/&gt; In February 1938 ''President McKinley'' returned, bringing Chinese laborers and Dollar Lines personnel who carried out some salvage and recovery work.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt; Dollar Lines surveyed the ship and concluded that she would be a [[Marine insurance#Actual total loss and constructive total loss|constructive total loss]].&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;&lt;ref name=HHPLM/&gt; Dollar Lines stripped what it could from the wreck and then sold her for $500,000 to the Kitagawa Ship Salvage Company,&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;&lt;ref name=HHPLM/&gt;

It took the Japanese salvagers the next three years to break up the wreck.&lt;ref name=CF-Stranding/&gt;&lt;ref name=HHPLM/&gt; By then Dollar Steamship Lines as a company had ceased to exist. In June 1938 ''Hoover''{{'}}s sister ship ''President Coolidge'' was arrested for an unpaid debt of $35,000,&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; and in August 1938 the [[United States Maritime Commission]] intervened by reorganising the company as [[American President Lines]].

Members of the US public gave money to the [[American Red Cross]] for a lighthouse to be built near Zhongliao village on Kasho-to (now called [[Green Island, Taiwan|Green Island]]).&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; [[Lyudao Lighthouse]] was designed by Japanese engineers, built by local islanders in 1938&lt;ref name=Takao2/&gt; and is {{convert|33.3|m}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tour.taitung.gov.tw/en/AllInOne_Show.aspx?path=1769&amp;guid=01a632cf-27e0-447e-a3ab-da9c4288d657&amp;lang=en-us |title=Lyudao Lighthouse |series=About Taitung |publisher=Department of Culture and Tourism, Taitung Government |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
