The '''South Sudan Democratic Movement''' (SSDM), sometimes called the '''South Sudan Democratic Movement/Army''' (SSDM/A), was a [[South Sudan]]ese militant group. Along with its armed wing, the South Sudan Defence Army (SSDA), rebelled against the [[government of South Sudan]] led by President [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]] and the [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;athor&quot;&gt;Small Arms Survey - HSBA Baseline Assessment, [http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/pdfs/facts-figures/armed-groups/southern-sudan/emerging/HSBA-Armed-Groups-Athor.pdf Armed Groups: Athor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation &amp; First Rebellion==
The Movement was formed in 2010 by controversial former [[Sudan]] [[People's Liberation Army]] [[general]] [[George Athor]] after he [[Jonglei gubernatorial election, 2010|failed to win the governorship]] of [[Jonglei]] in what was then the [[Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan]] in the state of Jonglei as well as neighbouring [[Upper Nile (state)|Upper Nile]] in the Republic of South Sudan. 

Due to Athor's access to military support from the Sudanese &amp; Eritrean Governments, he was able to attract other dissenting SPLA commanders such as [[Gatluak Gai]] in [[Unity State]], [[David Yau Yau]] in [[Pibor county]], and [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]] commanders [[John Uliny]] and [[Alyuak Ogot]] in [[Upper Nile (state)|Upper Nile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SASS SSDM/A-Athor&quot;&gt;[http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/nc/de/facts-figures/south-sudan/armed-groups/southern-dissident-militias/ssdma-athor.html?sword_list%5B0%5D=ssdm SSDM/A-Athor]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) accused the [[Sudan|North Sudan]]ese government of supporting the SSDM, SPLA officials did not elaborate on what role they believe [[Khartoum]]'s backing has played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/South-Sudan-says-new-evidence,41093|agency=Sudan Tribune|title=South Sudan says new evidence indicates Khartoum supported Athor|first=Ngor|last=Arol Garang|date=24 December 2011|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athor later signed a ceasefire agreement with the Government of South Sudan in January 2011, although the talks broke down and fighting re-erupted in February 2011. Other factions of the SSDM/A would later sign ceasefire agreements with the GOSS, with Yau Yau's faction signing one in June 2011, and Gai's in July 2011. Gai was allegedely murdered by his deputy in July 2011, although it is widely believed the SPLA were responsible, whilst Yau Yau, who had been stationed in Juba awaiting re-integration, would later defect to Khartoum in June 2012 and resume his factions insurgency in Jongeli in July 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;SASS SSDM/A-Athor&quot;/&gt;

Athor himself was killed on 19 December 2011 in [[Equatoria]] by [[South Sudan]]ese troops whilst allegedly attempting to cross into South Sudan from Uganda, resulting in Peter Kuol Chol Awan becoming SSDM/A Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC|title=South Sudan rebel George Athor 'killed'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16273758|accessdate=21 December 2011|newspaper=BBC Online|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Sudanese Government announced that the SSDM/A had signed a peace deal in February 2012, and SSDM/A Commander-in-Chief Peter Kuol Chol Awan travelled to Juba and surrendered to the SPLA on 8 March 2012. This agreement was not accepted by all SSDM/A factions however, and John Uliny's faction in Upper Nile rejected the agreement, with [[John Uliny]] claiming leadership of the SSDM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?mot934 |title=John Uliny - John Olony - Johnson Olony |publisher=[[Sudan Tribune]] |date= |accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remaining active until mid 2013. Small remnants of Athor's original force in Pigi County also rejected the agreement, remaining active until August 2013. The bulk of Athor's forces - some 1,300 - had been disarmed, trained, and were awaiting formal re-integration in Oinykibol training centre in Eastern Equatoria in late September 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;SASS SSDM/A-Athor&quot;/&gt;

==Structure==
Many SSDM fighters are from the [[Murle people|Murle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecitizen.info/opinion/killing-of-civilians-in-jonglei-state-as-government-leaders-watch/|agency=The Citizen|date=26 December 2011|title=Killing of Civilians in Jonglei State as Government Leaders Watch|accessdate=30 December 2011|first=Francis|last=Chagai Bol}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rebuildsudan.org/by-the-founder/juet-massacre-genocide-in-jonglei-south-sudan/|agency=RebuildSudan|title=Juet Massacre: Genocide in Jonglei, South Sudan|first=Michael|last=Ayeun Kuany|date=12 December 2011|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a minority tribe that has [[Sudanese nomadic conflicts|long disputed]] herds of [[livestock]] and pasturing grounds with a fellow cattle ranching tribe, the [[Nuer people|Lou Nuer]]. Under Athor's leadership, Murle tribesmen repeatedly [[2011 South Sudan clashes|clashed]] with the Lou Nuer and the [[armed forces of South Sudan]] throughout much of 2011.

===SSDM/A - Cobra Faction===
[[File:Flag of the South Sudan Defence Army - Cobra Faction.svg|thumb|The flag of the SSDA - Cobra Faction; a splinter of the wider SSDA, led by [[David Yau Yau]].]]
David Yau Yau had been one of the members of the original SSDM/A rebellion, joining following his failure to win a seat in the Jongeli state legislature in the 2010 elections. His main motivation was claimed to be the underdevelopment of Pibor County in Jonglei and the lack of local power-sharing with the Bor government. In the first SSDM/A rebellion Yau Yau's force was relatively small, with ~200 receiving presidential pardons following peace negotiations in June 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;SASS A-Cobra Faction&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/de/facts-figures/south-sudan/armed-groups/southern-dissident-militias/ssdma-cobra-faction.html|title=SSDM/A-Cobra faction|date=15 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yau Yau later returned to Pibor in July 2012 to restart his rebellion, having been dissatisfied with the integration package offered, and being opposed to the ongoing political marginalization of Murle people in Pibor county.&lt;ref name=&quot;SASS A-Cobra Faction&quot;/&gt;

The Cobra Faction later signed a peace agreement on 30 January 2014 which established the semi-autonomous [[Greater Pibor Administrative Area]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/fileadmin/docs/working-papers/HSBA-WP35-Greater-Pibor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015 a splinter from the Cobra Faction; the Greater Pibor Forces, joined with the [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition|forces]] of [[Riek Machar]] in the ongoing [[South Sudanese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article53980|title=Murle faction announces defection to S. Sudan rebels|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, however, the Cobra Faction was declared restored by some of its commanders and declared that it had resumed its struggle against the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;cobra restored&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/top-cobra-faction-general-defects-kiir-government|title=Top Cobra Faction general defects from Kiir government|newspaper=Radio Tamazuj|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SSDM/A-Upper Nile faction===
The SSDM/A-Upper Nile faction was led by [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]] commanders [[John Uliny]] and [[Alyuak Ogot]], and was initially driven largely by disputes between the Shilluk community and the Upper Nile state government over land and county boundaries. Later motivations included revenge over the 2010 disarmament campaign, in which it was claimed the SPLA's 7th Division committed large scale abuses. The South Sudanese Government has claimed the Upper Nile Faction is linked with [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement - Democratic Change|SPLM-DC]], although SPLM-DC leader [[Lam Akol]] denies this.&lt;ref name=&quot;SASS Upper Nile faction&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/nc/de/facts-figures/south-sudan/armed-groups/southern-dissident-militias/ssdma-upper-nile.html?sword_list%5B0%5D=ssdm|title=SSDM/A-Upper Nile|date=15 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
