== Evaluating removal of Scott's &quot;After the Alamo&quot; references ==

Here is my assessment:

This is the first sentence (in bold) removed by {{yo|Bobwolfe23}}  Many were slave owners, and most brought with them significant prejudices against other races, attitudes often applied to the ''Tejanos,'' '''where they mingled with the biases and prejudices of the Tejanos and those of indigenous peoples'''

So, what were these &quot;significant prejudices against other races&quot; held by these U.S. Southerners? According to Dunbar-Ortiz in &quot;An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States,&quot; (2014), Anglo-American racism was based on &quot;Indian hating and white supremacy [which] were part and parcel of 'democracy' and 'freedom.'&quot; (p.117) The populist poet Walt Whitman stated it thusly: &quot;The nigg**, like the Injun, will be eliminated; it is the law of the races, of history.&quot; (p.117)  And finally:  &quot;Whitman's sentiments reflected the established U.S. origin myth that had the frontier settlers replacing the Native peoples as historical destiny, adding his own theoretical twist of what would later be called Social Darwinism.&quot; (p.118) The successive invasions and occupations of Indigenous nations and Mexico was colonialist and imperialist... &quot;Mexico was just another Indian nation to be crushed.&quot; (p.118)

Therefore, in order to define these &quot;prejudices&quot; and give readers a better idea of the mindset and motivation of most &quot;Texians,&quot; I suggest changing the above sentence to:  &quot;Many were slave owners, who brought with them racist attitudes and a belief of white supremacy over Indigenous peoples, African-Americans, and Mexicans.&quot; Comments, anyone?

I'll deal with the second half of the sentence later. [[User:MiztuhX|MiztuhX]] ([[User talk:MiztuhX|talk]]) 02:57, 29 January 2016 (UTC)

:Continuing with the argument to include mention of Texian racism instead of the euphemistic term &quot;significant prejudices.&quot; From &quot;They Called Them Greasers:  Anglo Attitudes toward Mexicans in Texas, 1821-1900&quot; (1983) by Arnoldo de León. Here are a few quotes to get the discussion going:

:&quot;...those who have traditionally dominated Texas history have published works that reveal, in fact and interpretations, serious flaws, deficiencies of research, and detectable bias, especially concerning the relationships between whites and Mexicans...overlooking a long racist and ethnocentric tradition toward blacks and Indians that was transposed upon native Texas ''castas'' as a matter of course.&quot; (ix-x)

:&quot;...I cannot help but support the theory that whites in the nineteenth century were more racists than cultural chauvinists...and that native peoples in the path of white civilization have historically been either exterminated or reduced to a hereditary caste because of the peculiar strain of that racism.&quot; (xi)

:&quot;Anglo settlers who arrived in Texas imported certain ideas from the United States, which regarded the native Mexican population as less than civilized. These attitudes ranged from xenophobia against Catholics and Spaniards to racial prejudice against Indians and blacks. Thus Mexicanos were doubly suspect, as heirs to Catholicism and as descendants of Spaniards, Indians and Africans.&quot; (4)

:&quot;The long history of hostilities against North American Indians on the frontier and the institution of Afro-American slavery molded negative attitudes toward dark skin, 'savagery,' 'vice,' and interracial sex. The majority of those who responded to empresario calls most assuredly thought along those lines, for they came from the states west of the Appalachians and south of the Ohio River—Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi, Georgia, and Kentucky.&quot; (6)

:&quot;Throughout the province, Tejanos had intermarried among themselves and with Christianized Indian women from local missions so that the colonists continued as a mixed-blood population. Their contrast to 'white' and salient kindred to 'black' and 'red' made Mexicans subject to treatment commensurate with the odious connotations whites attached to colors, races, and cultures dissimilar to their own.&quot; (6) 

:There are more quotes, but I think I've proved my point.  Comments, anyone?  [[User:MiztuhX|MiztuhX]] ([[User talk:MiztuhX|talk]]) 17:25, 13 March 2016 (UTC)

::Another source, this time &quot;Myths, Misdeeds, and Misunderstandings:  The Roots of Conflict in U.S.-Mexican Relations&quot; in &quot;It Takes Two to Tango&quot; by Rodríguez O. and Vincent:  &quot;Both the Texas Revolt in 1836 and the Mexican War in 1846-1848 can be easily explained in terms of anti-Catholicism and anti-Spanishness, now transferred to Mexico, along with blatant desires for territorial expansion and expressions of racial superiority.&quot; (7-8)

::Also:  &quot;Whereas the leaders of newly independent Mexico looked to their northern neighbor with expectations of friendship and collaboration, most citizens of the United States perceived the southern republic one as peopled by degenerate, inferior Catholic mongrels, who, like the Indians, did not deserve to retain their land.&quot; (10) [[User:MiztuhX|MiztuhX]] ([[User talk:MiztuhX|talk]]) 22:31, 26 March 2016 (UTC)

:::So, according to these historians, other adjectives to describe Texian colonists would be:  anti-Spanish, anti-Catholic, xenophobic, expansionist, and a sense of being God's chosen people to eradicate (murder) the savages, tame this barren land (steal), and make it productive as a sign of their righteous exceptionalism (Manifest Destiny).  I think by integrating these terms, the article would definitely improve it as it would balance out the current mythic and propagandistic tone of revolt and revolution.[[User:MiztuhX|MiztuhX]] ([[User talk:MiztuhX|talk]]) 20:32, 29 March 2016 (UTC) [[User:MiztuhX|MiztuhX]] ([[User talk:MiztuhX|talk]]) 20:32, 29 March 2016 (UTC)

== Proposal to include population of Texas Indigenous peoples ==

In the Background section:  &quot;Texas was very sparsely populated, with fewer than 3,500 residents,[Note 3] and only about 200 soldiers,[11][12] which made it extremely vulnerable to attacks by native tribes and American filibusters.[13]&quot; 

Note 3 states:  &quot;This number excludes native tribes.&quot;  I would like to replace that with:  &quot;The Indigenous peoples of Texas included the Lupin Apaches, Jumanos, Coahuiltecans, Tonkawas, Karankawas, Caddos, Comanches, and Wichitas.  By the time of Mexican independence, the Indigenous population of the province was around fifty thousand, a number which would later grow in the next decade as some ten thousand Cherokees, Seminoles, Shawnees and many other Indigenous communities east of the Mississippi, avoided forced removal by the United States by taking refuge in Mexico. (Dunbar-Ortiz, 126). [[User:MiztuhX|MiztuhX]] ([[User talk:MiztuhX|talk]]) 03:22, 29 January 2016 (UTC)
::I support including the Native population - but not necessarily mentioning all known tribes. What would be more useful would be an estimate of the ''number'' of indigenous inhabitants of the state's territory. Also the statement about Texas being vulnerable to attacks from Native tribes needs to go - they were not attacking &quot;Texas&quot; but settler communities. [[User:Maunus|·maunus]] · [[User talk:Maunus|snunɐɯ·]] 03:25, 29 January 2016 (UTC)

*Thornton[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9iQYSQ9y60MC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=population+history+of+Texas&amp;ots=IPPrVIgAZ4&amp;sig=DLXLtjUXxziteYVOnjMR3gLo6ho#v=onepage&amp;q=Texas&amp;f=false], giving data from Ewers 1973, gives the 1690 indigenous population of Texas as more than 42,000, and the 1890 indigenous population as a little less than 16,000. So at the time of the revolution it was likely considerably higher than that - perhaps higher than 20,000 people.[[User:Maunus|·maunus]] · [[User talk:Maunus|snunɐɯ·]] 03:49, 29 January 2016 (UTC)

:::Yes, Dunbar-Ortiz agrees.  She states 50,000 Indigenous peoples in Texas by 1821 and another 10,000 who arrived over the next decade. Also, I think it's important to mention each tribe in order to not lump them all together under the generic category of Indigenous peoples. Each tribe was/is a sovereign nation, so it's important to give them their due and recognize their place in history. This is what Dunbar-Ortiz, the author, does in her book. Plus, it serves as a starting point to include other references to specific Indigenous tribes who had interactions with Anglos, Tejanos, and Mexicans during this period in Texas history. There is a whole Native peoples' dynamic that has been left out of this article that I would like to gradually fill in.  But having said that I would be willing to just add a number to get my foot in the door. And I agree with you on your last point about Native tribes not attacking Texas!  :-)  A kind suggestion:  How about rewriting the sentence the way you would like it to read? I would love to read it! [[User:MiztuhX|MiztuhX]] ([[User talk:MiztuhX|talk]]) 03:57, 29 January 2016 (UTC)
:::::::I actually already did. I think the tribal names if necessary would have to go in a footnote, since they are not directly relevant to the topic ofthe revolution.[[User:Maunus|·maunus]] · [[User talk:Maunus|snunɐɯ·]] 04:12, 29 January 2016 (UTC)
::::::::Yes, exactly. The summary I wrote in my first entry would all be included under [Note 3] which would only appear if you place your cursor above it. An interesting side note is that Mexico during the reign of Iturbide considered Native peoples their subjects if they were born in Mexican territory. Their colonization laws also applied to them if they converted to Catholicism. Anyway, let's wait a few days before adding this information to the article to see if any other editors would like to comment. Thanks, [[User:MiztuhX|MiztuhX]] ([[User talk:MiztuhX|talk]]) 05:08, 29 January 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::::What do you mean by &quot;colonization laws&quot; when referring to the period under Iturbide? But yes, lets wait for more input. I think the most pressing problem has already been remedied by making it clear that the population figure only includes settlers.[[User:Maunus|·maunus]] · [[User talk:Maunus|snunɐɯ·]] 05:14, 29 January 2016 (UTC)

== Reverting edits by known sock ==

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz, now confirmed as a blocked sock of SkepticAnonymous, made numerous and questionable edits to this article beginning January 22, 2016.  I have reverted this Featured Article back to its state before this sock made any of the edits. [[User:Maile66|— Maile ]] ([[User talk:Maile66|talk]]) 18:02, 5 June 2016 (UTC)

:Just an F.Y.I., as of this date, the SPI (Sock Puppet Investigation) case against SkepticAnonymous is still open. In addition, [[User:Maile66|— Maile ]] ([[User talk:Maile66|talk]]) is now attempting to link my edits to Prostentic Vogon Jeltz as also being the work of a [[Sockpuppet_(Internet)|sock puppet]].

== Restoring History of Mexico sidebar.  Do not remove again. ==

History of Mexico First Republic was removed.  Don't do that again.  Discuss here anytime, but do not remove a sidebar on a Featured Article.

=='Texas' as adjective==
Hello, I'm not a English native speaker, so understand my doubt, can &quot;Texas&quot; be an adjective? It would be be like &quot;America revolution&quot; instead of &quot;American&quot;.  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:MARX, Julius|MARX, Julius]] ([[User talk:MARX, Julius#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/MARX, Julius|contribs]]) 04:46, 2 October 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Yes, it can, although it's not common; [[Paris Commune]], [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and [[Warsaw Uprising]] are a few comparable examples of &quot;use of the place-name rather than the demonym in the common name of a revolt&quot;. In any case, we go by what something is commonly referred to (if the T.R. were commonly referred to as &quot;Glorious Texas Seperate from Mexico Event&quot; that's the name we'd use), and it's [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Texas+Revolution%2CTexan+Revolution&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CTexas%20Revolution%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3BTexas%20Revolution%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BTexas%20revolution%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BTEXAS%20REVOLUTION%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2CTexan%20Revolution%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3BTexan%20Revolution%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BTexan%20revolution%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BTEXAN%20REVOLUTION%3B%2Cc0 easily demonstrated] that while it was primarily referred to as &quot;Texan Revolution&quot; ''at the time'', since 1900 it's been consistently referred to as &quot;Texas Revolution&quot;. (The spike in the older use in 1935–45 is no doubt due to historic documents being reprinted in connection with the centenary.)&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8209;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Iridescent|Iridescent]] 08:17, 2 October 2016 (UTC)
::By comparison, we have [[Missouri Compromise]], [[California Gold Rush]].  In general when it comes to the individual states, once &quot;an&quot; is put after the state, it is referring to a person who lives there such as Texan, Californian, Arizonan.
