'''No. 3 Aircraft Depot''' (No.&amp;nbsp;3 AD) was a maintenance unit of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).  Formed in March 1942 at [[RAAF Base Amberley|RAAF Station Amberley]], Queensland, its prime function initially was the assembly and despatch of combat aircraft from the United States; it also performed salvage operations. From 1942 until 1947 it took on the role of administering the Amberley base. The depot was responsible for heavy maintenance of the RAAF's [[English Electric Canberra]] jet bombers following their entry into service in 1953. In the 1970s it began maintaining and upgrading the [[General Dynamics F-111C]] swing-wing bomber, along with [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] and [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] helicopters. No.&amp;nbsp;3 AD merged with [[No. 482 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;482 Maintenance Squadron]] in March 1992 to form No.&amp;nbsp;501 Wing, which maintained the F-111 until disbanding in 2001.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:NEA0687No.3AircraftDepot1945.jpg|thumb|left|No. 3 AD personnel at work on a Supermarine Spitfire Mk&amp;nbsp;VIII, July 1945|alt=Three men servicing a single-engined military aircraft]]
No. 3 Aircraft Depot (No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD) was formed at [[RAAF Base Amberley|RAAF Station Amberley]], Queensland, on 16&amp;nbsp;March 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; It came under the control of [[No. 5 Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 (Maintenance) Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The depot's first, temporary, commanding officer was [[Squadron Leader]] W.H. Nicholson. On establishment, No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD's main purpose was the assembly and despatch of combat aircraft manufactured in the United States. In its first six weeks of operation, it assembled 123 [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]] fighters and a dozen [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] medium bombers. The depot was also responsible for the inspection of RAAF [[CAC Wirraway]]s and [[Lockheed Hudson]]s. A further role was salvaging damaged aircraft from units in the local area, and despatching them to [[No. 5 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 Aircraft Depot]] at [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Station Wagga]], New South Wales, for repair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt;

[[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] (later [[Group Captain]]) G.E. Douglas, previously in charge of [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot]] at [[RAAF Williams|Laverton]], Victoria, assumed command of No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD in June 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/douglas-gilbert-eric-10038 |title=Douglas, Gilbert Eric (1902–1970)|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate= 22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Station Headquarters Amberley was dissolved on 1&amp;nbsp;July, and the depot took over the role of command and control of the base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amberley&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations'', pp. 119–123&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, Amberley became one of Australia's largest aircraft maintenance facilities, as well as a way station for [[United States Army Air Forces]] personnel and equipment bound for operations in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Air Power Development Centre |date=September 2008 | title= Superbase #1: RAAF Amberley Past to Future | journal= Pathfinder, Issue 97 | publisher= [[Royal Australian Air Force]]| url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/admin/productfiles/publication/materials/346/pf97_sept08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Airacobras and Marauders, among the aircraft types No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD assembled during World War&amp;nbsp;II were [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks]], [[Republic P-43 Lancer]]s, [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance]]s, [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s, [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]]s, and [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amberley&quot;/&gt;

===Post-war years===
[[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No. 82 (Heavy Bomber) Wing]] and its three squadrons of [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s arrived at Amberley as lodger units between February and April 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About_us/Structure_of_the_RAAF/Air_Command/Air_Combat_Group/No._82_Wing/?RAAF-WzgfY9dEDWSBEvvSRgeZ/WcXQg2nJdR/|title= No. 82 Wing|publisher=Royal Australian Air Force|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of World War&amp;nbsp;II, No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD continued to command and administer the base until the re-establishment of Station Headquarters Amberley in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amberley&quot;/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing converted to [[Avro Lincoln]]s during 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Lincoln, Canberra and F-111'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 1952, when Lincolns flew observation flights as part of [[Operation Hurricane]], the first British atomic test in Australia, No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD was responsible for handling underwing canisters used to collect radioactive particles.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Lincoln, Canberra and F-111'', pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF's first jet bomber, the [[English Electric Canberra]], began replacing the Lincoln in December 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canberra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A84.htm |title=Canberra|publisher= [[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate= 20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Lincoln, Canberra and F-111'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD was responsible for &quot;deep&quot; maintenance of the Canberra, which involved stripping aircraft back to their components. This process was generally required every five years, and could take up to a year to complete. The depot also performed deep maintenance on the [[CAC Sabre]] fighter during its service with the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD's crest was approved by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] in June 1959; the design featured a [[Maltese cross]] in [[Azure (color)|azure]], symbolising the unit's home state of Queensland, surmounted by a cock's head in gold with a red comb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Crests tell history|magazine=RAAF News |volume=4 |issue=11|date= December 1962|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 1966 until January 1969, No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD was commanded by Group Captain [[James Rowland (RAAF officer)|James Rowland]], later [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] and [[Governor of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Marshals-of-the-RAAF/134/Air-Marshals.aspx |title=Air Marshals |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=28 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601193800/http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Marshals-of-the-RAAF/134/Air-Marshals.aspx |archivedate=June 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, the depot was responsible for maintenance of the RAAF's [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters as well as the Canberra bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; It also maintained the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom]]s leased to the RAAF from 1970 to 1973 as an [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in Australian service|interim strike force]] pending delivery of the long-delayed [[General Dynamics F-111C]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 386–388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-111C represented the most significant maintenance challenge undertaken by the RAAF, and No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD's hangars and workshops were extensively revamped before and after the new bomber's entry into service in mid-1973.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', pp. 41, 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; The depot was responsible for major upgrades and complex maintenance involving stripping down the airframe and engines, while intermediate-level servicing was carried out by [[No. 482 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;482 (Maintenance) Squadron]], a unit of No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Lincoln, Canberra and F-111'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maintenance Units'', pp. 66–69&lt;/ref&gt; After [[General Dynamics]] in [[Fort Worth]], Texas, had modified the first of four F-111Cs earmarked to be brought up to RF-111C standard for photographic reconnaissance, No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD modified the remaining three aircraft at Amberley during 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Air Power Development Centre |date=February 2010 | title= Manned ISR: The RF-111C | journal= Pathfinder, Issue 128 | publisher= Royal Australian Air Force| url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/admin/productfiles/publication/materials/411/pathfinder_128_feb10%20small.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982–83, the depot upgraded to C-model standard four [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111As]] delivered to replace the four F-111Cs from the RAAF's original order that had been lost through accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', pp. 162&lt;/ref&gt; It conducted the F-111 [[Pave Tack]] infra-red and laser-guided precision weapons targeting system upgrade in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', pp. 164–167&lt;/ref&gt;  No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD also took on responsibility for maintenance of [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]]s after the helicopters [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook in Australian service|entered service]] with [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron]], based at Amberley, in September 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series3/A15.htm |title=Boeing-Vertol CH-47 Chinook|publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate= 20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depot had no familiarity dealing with significant damage to the Chinook, and when one of the helicopters crashed following an engine failure in 1975 the repairs were not completed until 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinook&quot;/&gt;

From the 1980s, No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD's organisation included a maintenance management squadron made up of individual [[Flight (military unit)|flights]] responsible for the upkeep of equipment, engines, and airframes, the last-mentioned including armament and de-seal/re-seal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; The process for de-sealing and re-sealing the F-111s fuel tanks, which the depot first undertook between 1977 and 1982 and which lasted six months per aircraft, caused controversy owing to the hazardous working conditions for ground crews. Brain damage to personnel caused by chemical exposure resulted in a [[class action]] that cost the Australian government more than [[Australian dollar|A$]]20 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', pp. 206–208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safetyculture.com.au/newsold/Apr07.php|title=F-111 action stalls without getting off the ground|work=Safety Culture|date=11 April 2007|accessdate= 20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16&amp;nbsp;March 1992, No.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;AD merged with No.&amp;nbsp;482 Squadron to form No.&amp;nbsp;501 Wing, which became the largest unit in the RAAF, comprising over 1,200 personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amberley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;  The depot completed its disbandment on 30&amp;nbsp;June that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;501 Wing continued to provide deep maintenance and logistics support for the F-111s at Amberley until 2001, when [[Boeing Australia]] was awarded the maintenance contract.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air Force Australia'', pp. 192, 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt;
