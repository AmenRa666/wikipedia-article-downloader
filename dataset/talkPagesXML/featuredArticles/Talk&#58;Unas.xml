Unas, was also called Unas, Slayer of the Gods. People claimed that he devoured gods to gain their powers.

* The pyramid is supposed to be &quot;Beautiful are the Places of Unas&quot; not Teti. So it has been corrected. A source would be I.E.S. Edwards' &quot;Pyramids of Egypt&quot;    &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Muirwood|Muirwood]] ([[User talk:Muirwood|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Muirwood|contribs]]) 07:23, 2 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

* I have rejigged this page a bit - might delete the 5300BC references, as this seems a bit wild - anyone got a reference for this ? 08:40, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

** There was a bout of vandalism not so long ago, and someone added the text verbatim from this source (scroll to the bottom of the page): http://www.musicsonglyrics.com/N/nilelyrics/nileunasslayerofthegodslyrics.htm. This is from doing a Google search on a few words from the submitted &quot;article&quot;. It appears to be some explanitory text for what I assume is a heavy metal rock band song. The information, as far as I can tell, is not incorrect, thought the 5300BC statement is definitely extreme, as are some of the comments with regard to the &quot;magick&quot; of the hieroglyphic text found on Unas' walls. Since the text is basically a cut and paste from another site, it should either be wholly removed for reasons of copyright infringement, or heavily re-written/edited (preferably with attributions) to make it fit.

*** Yes, most of this was stolen from the explanation to the song &quot;Unas, Slayer of the Gods&quot; by the South Carolina death metal band, Nile.  Karl Sanders, one of the guitarists, vocalists, and the main lyric writer is well-versed in Egyptology, though he has no official degree.  Personally I would trust most of his information, but for the sake of wikipedia, the article needs a more authoritative source than a heavy metal musician with a hobby in Egyptology.  Plus it is plagiarism from the booklet of Nile album ''In Their Darkened Shrines''

** I have moved the section on the pyramid complex to its own article (and removed reference to 5300BC as this seems to be erroneous). I will tify up the new article, as it seems to be rather breathless in style. [[User:Markh|Markh]] 15:41, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

What? Isn't wenis the hard skin at your elbow?

* because that is one of the names he has been refered to as.

but it doesn't say that he has been referred to as wenis?  it has Oenas, Unis, or Ounas.  no wenis.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/118.209.238.62|118.209.238.62]] ([[User talk:118.209.238.62|talk]]) 10:29, 9 November 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Who were Unas' parents?--[[User:Mychele Trempetich|Mychele]] ([[User talk:Mychele Trempetich|talk]]) 15:47, 10 June 2010 (UTC)
::{{U|Mychele Trempetich}} In spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question, Egyptologist think Unas' father was probably his predecessor Djedkare Isesi (mostly because of the apparently smooth transition between the two). The identity of his mother is completely unknown. We might logically suspect one of Djedkare's queens, but the only candidate known to us is Meresankh IV, who was quite possibly a wife of Menkauhor Kaiu instead. (Sorry for the nearly five years delay to get your answer).[[User:Iry-Hor|&amp;#32;Iry-Hor]] ([[User talk:Iry-Hor|talk]]) 07:33, 17 March 2015 (UTC)

== Sarcophagus ==
Article identifies the sarcophagus as black basalt. However, German WP [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unas-Pyramide sidebar] about the Unas Pyramid states it's made of [[Greywacke]], a type of sandstone: ''Am Fußende des Sarkophages aus Grauwacke (nach älteren Bestimmungen fälschlich auch als Basalt angegeben)....'' Also says sarcophagus contained remains of mummies, not &quot;scattered bones.&quot;

(Disclosure: I know nothing about this subject, having discovered it via the July 5 TFA.) [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 20:22, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
::{{u|Sca}} Thank you for the information, I am aware of this and I am not sure where the editors of the German wiki got this because in his book on Egyptian pyramids, Mark Lehner clearly state that the sarcophagus is of black basalt and contained a few bones, not a mummy.[[User:Iry-Hor|&amp;#32;Iry-Hor]] ([[User talk:Iry-Hor|talk]]) 18:28, 18 July 2015 (UTC)
