'''Toul-Croix De Metz Airfield''' is a former military airfield which is located approximately 1 mile northeast of [[Toul]] (Département de Meurthe-et-Moselle, Lorraine); 160 miles east of [[Paris]].

The airfield had its origins in the [[World War I]] [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as an [[History of the Armée de l'Air (1909–42)|''Aéronautique Militaire'']] airfield, later being extensively used by the [[United States Army Air Service]]. It became a permanent airfield between the wars and during the [[Phony War]] with Nazi Germany (1939–1940) was the home of G.C. II/5 (The French Air Force descendant of the World War I [[Lafayette Escadrille]]) equipped with American [[P-36 Hawk|Curtis Hawk 75A]] fighters. Seized in the [[Battle of France]], it became a [[Luftwaffe]] airfield until being captured by the [[United States Third Army]] in September 1944. It then became a [[United States Army Air Forces]] combat airfield until the end of the war.

After the war, the airfield was redeveloped into a private industrial estate.

==History==

===World War I===
'''Gengault Aerodrome''' was established about 1916 by the French Air Force as a combat airfield on the [[World War I]] [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. It is undetermined which French units were stationed at the airfield during the war, however, it is known that airships were hangared and flown from the field. &lt;ref name=&quot;AbAirf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forgottenairfields.com/france/lorraine/meurthe-et-moselle/toul-croix-de-metz-s1147.html  |title= Toul-Croix De Metz Airfield |author=Unknown |access-date= July 6, 2016 |website= Abandoned, Forgotten &amp; Little Known Airfields in Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1918 it was turned over to the [[American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF). When first deployed to France, the Aero Squadrons of the AEF were dispersed among the various army organizations. This made it difficult, however, to obtain coordination of aerial activities. Some higher organization was required. The [[United States Army Air Service]] Aero Squadrons were organized as part of the 2d, 3d and 4th Pursuit Groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaww1.com/index.php4 American Aviators of World War I]&lt;/ref&gt; Known American units at Toul were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II|origyear=1969|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/combat_sq_of_the_af_wwii.pdf |edition= reprint|year=1982|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-405-12194-6|oclc=72556|lccn=70605402|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that other American air units were assigned to Toul during World War I, however they are unidentified. The Americans at Toul flew reconnaissance sorties, protected observation aircraft, attacked enemy observation balloons, strafed enemy troops, flew counter-air patrols, and bombed towns, bridges, and railroad stations behind the enemy's lines.

Some of the most illustrious names in early American Army aviation were assigned to Toul during World War I, including [[Eddie Rickenbacker]]; [[Quentin Roosevelt]]; [[Frank Luke]]; [[Carl Spaatz]]; [[Billy Mitchell (general)|Billy Mitchell]] and others.

The Americans at Toul demobilized and left France after the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]] on 11 November 1918, the last leaving in early 1919.

===Between the wars===
Various French Air Force air regiments were assigned to the base during the 1920s, during which the wartime grass field became a permanent base, with a large technical support area, hangars, barracks and other facilities being constructed.

When [[World War II]] broke out in September 1939, the 35th Aero Regiment was assigned to Toul-Croix De Metz, the 7th squadron of which was the descendant of the World War I [[Lafayette Escadrille]], &quot;Groupe de Chasse II/5, the Escadron Lafayette&quot;. The Regiment was equipped with obsolete [[P-36 Hawk|Curtiss Hawk Model 75s]]. From surviving accounts of the squadron during the [[Battle of France]] the Hawk-equipped Regiment claimed 230 confirmed and 80 probable victories in H75s against only 29 aircraft lost in aerial combat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neam.org/lafescweb/afterthewar.html Lafayette Escadrille - Post WWI]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the French unis, Polish Air Force exiles flew Moraine fighters from the airfield during the early weeks of the German offensive into France and the Low Countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;AbAirf&quot;/&gt;

With the subsequent German [[Blitzkrieg]] and the breakout of the [[Wehrmacht]] at [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]] the French Army and the British Expeditionary Force was overwhelmed.  The units assigned to the field surrendered to the Germans along with the French Armed Forces at the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne]] on 22 June 1940.

===German use during World War II===
Shortly after its capture, the airfield was turned over to the [[Luftwaffe]]. The airfield was initially used primarily as a training base for ground support units. In September 1942, Zerstörerschule 2 (Fighter-Destroyer School 2) (ZS 2) used the base as a training facility for [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] fighter pilots until February 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;vit1&quot;&gt;[http://www.ww2.dk The Luftwaffe, 1933-45]&lt;/ref&gt;

Toul became an operational airfield in July 1944, when [[Kampfgeschwader 53]] (KG 53) arrived at the airfield with [[Heinkel He 111]] medium bombers. The He 111s were used as carrier aircraft for launching [[V-1 Flying Bomb]]s, aimed at targets in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&amp;nbsp;kg 53 withdrew from the airfield at the end of August, ahead of the advancing [[United States Army Central|American Third Army]] which was moving into the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;vit1&quot;/&gt; Toul-Croix De Metz was attacked by USAAF [[Eighth Air Force]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] heavy bombers to attempt to stop these V-1 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/221/383.xml USAFHRA Document 00221383]&lt;/ref&gt;

===American use during World War II===
The IX Engineer Command moved the 826th Engineer Aviation Battalion to Toul airfield on 14 September 1944. The airfield was relatively intact, and began clearing the airport of mines; destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft, and repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. Subsequently, it became a USAAF [[United States Air Forces Central|Ninth Air Force]] combat airfield, designated as [[Advanced Landing Ground]] &quot;A-90&quot; Toul-Croix De Metz the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;eng&quot;&gt;[http://www.ixengineercommand.com/airfields/general.php IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under American control, Toul-Croix De Metz was initially used as a resupply and casualty evacuation (S&amp;E) airfield, with [[C-47 Skytrain]] transports using the airfield frequently, carrying in supplies and moving wounded personnel to hospitals in the rear.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama.&lt;/ref&gt; In October, the 862d EAB moved in and laid down a 5000' [[Pierced Steel Planking]] all-weather runway. The engineers also repaired the barracks and other facilities at the base, allowing it to be used though the winter months.&lt;ref name=&quot;eng&quot;/&gt;

In November, the [[358th Fighter Group]] moved in with [[P-47 Thunderbolts]] and flew operational missions from the base until the beginning of April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. ISBN 0-89201-092-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The airfield was closed, and returned to French control after the war on 30 October 1945.

===Postwar use===
In French control after the war, the airfield was closed and for years was left unused. The growing urban area of [[Toul]] and the need for other, more pressing reconstruction after the war led the Air Ministry to sell off the property to private interests, and not rebuild it as a military airfield. A major reason was that the airfield was physically small, and the cost to purchase additional land to build a jet runway, and other facilities was very high. In addition, the prospect of jet fighter aircraft taking off and landing over the urbanized area around the airfield was highly undesirable. In 1950 when [[NATO]] was looking to locate an [[USAF|American Air Force]] fighter airfield in the area, given the historical American association with Toul, the World War II airfield at [[Toul-Rosières Air Base|Rosieres En Haye]] was made available.&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, Jerome J: U.S. Air Force in France 1950-1967 (2005), Chapter 16, Toul-Rosieres Air Base.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Army use===
In 1951, the abandoned airfield was turned over by the French to the United States Army for use as an Engineering Depot.&lt;ref name=&quot;AbAirf&quot;/&gt; Army units were assigned to the field to clear the remnants of the World War II Army Airfield and completely re-design the facility.   Railroad spurs, new hard-surfaced roads, permanent buildings, warehouses and utilities were put in, and in December 1952 the facility was re-opened as the Toul Engineer Depot.&lt;ref name=&quot;AbAirf&quot;/&gt;

Initially used as a reserve depot for supplies and equipment, but in 1955 the facility was upgraded to become a major depot supporting USAREUR units in both France and Germany.   This was scaled back in 1956 due to budget reductions to support Army Engineering units in France only.&lt;ref name=&quot;AbAirf&quot;/&gt;  Further budget cuts in 1960 led to its consolidation with the Army's Nancy General Depot, and in November 1961 the facility was closed and returned to French military control..&lt;ref name=&quot;AbAirf&quot;/&gt;    

===Current use===
The French government sold the land and all of the buildings to private interests during the 1960s.  Today in aerial photography, clear outlines of former buildings can be seen in grassy areas, as well as the runways and taxiways of the former airfield, the streets put in by the United States Army.   It is now an industrial estate.
