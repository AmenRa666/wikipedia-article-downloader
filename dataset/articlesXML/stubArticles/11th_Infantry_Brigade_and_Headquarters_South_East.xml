The '''11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East''' is a [[Regular army|regular]] [[British Army]] [[brigade]] formation that is part of the Army’s 'Adaptable Force' meaning it has operational units under command, as well as regional responsibilities across the South East of England. The Brigade was re-established on 1 August 2014 when [[145 (South) Brigade (United Kingdom)|145 (South) Brigade]] was re-designated as Headquarters 11th Infantry Brigade. In December 2014 the brigade merged with [[2nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|2 (South East) Brigade]] to form Headquarters 11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/34892.aspx |title=Headquarters 11th Infantry Brigade |work=British Army Website |year=2014 |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brigade served in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Deactivated in 1958, it was reactivated in 2008 to assume command of the planned [[Operation Herrick]] deployment to [[Afghanistan]] in late 2009.
