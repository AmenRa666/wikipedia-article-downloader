==Unreliable Source==
The same editor is using the same unreliable source, published by Nortom, in multiple articles.  The following editors have deemd it to be unreliable (comments are taken from the discussion pages of more than this article):
*[[User:Lysy|Lysy]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia&amp;curid=550549&amp;diff=310788965&amp;oldid=310788461] &quot; cannot comment about these figures but I would also be very suspicious about the books, especially if they are published by the likes of Nortom. We should be very careful with selection of sources for this article and I'd rather stick to books witten by respected historians, where possible, and of course none of them would publish a book at Nortom, which is mainly a Polish nationalistic propaganda outlet. For the same reason I would avoid books published by Ukrainian diaspora or by Russian or Ukrainian authors clearly influenced by Soviet ideology. Can we get any credentials on these Polish authors ? Are they affiliated with any major university?&quot;
*[[User:Radeksz|radek]] ([[User talk:Radeksz|talk]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AChodaczkow_Wielki_massacre&amp;diff=310792609&amp;oldid=310725213] &quot;haven't really read that much about this issue so I comment with some hesitation. However, I do agree with the opinion of Lysy here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia&amp;curid=550549&amp;diff=310788965&amp;oldid=310788461] that publications by Nortom should not be used as sources. Additionally, I have some recollection that Leon Kieres and the IPN stated that there was no evidence of ''Galitzien'' being involved in this particular massacre. I think that Tymek went out of his way on this one to only use reliable sources and that's exactly how these kinds of articles should be approached.&quot;

*Obviously, myself.
It should be noted that this is not a case of Ukrainian vs. Polish editors, as two Polish editors agree that the source is not reliable.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 13:38, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

Publihing house didnt write books, but the authors did. You have no reliable arguments. Lysy and Radek didnt say its not reliable. Stop whitewashing SS-Galizien, you have been warned by admin. You also removed antohers source like Polish radio site. As I said i [[Talk:Chodaczkow Wielki massacre|Chodaczkow talk]], Siekierka's book is used as source for [[Grzegorz Motyka]] book, and were reviewed by 2 polish historians.--[[User:Paweł5586|Paweł5586]] ([[User talk:Paweł5586|talk]]) 16:07, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
:Authors are not historians, and one of the reviewers stated it's one-sided. Radek, a Polish editor, stated &quot;I'd rather stick to books witten by respected historians, where possible, and '''of course none of them would publish a book at Nortom, which is mainly a Polish nationalistic propaganda outlet'''.&quot;[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 00:50, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

::For you most of Polish historians and researchers which are writting about crimes committed by UIA, SS-Galizien arent reliable: Summary: 1. [[Władysław Filar]] - not reliable, 2. [[Edward Prus]] - not reliable, 3. [[Zbigniew Palski]] - not reliable 4. [[Wiktor Poliszczuk]] - not reliable, 5. [[Aleksander Korman]] - not reliable, 6. [[Władysław Siemaszko]] - not reliable, 7. [[Ewa Siemaszko]] - not reliable, 8. Komański &amp; [[Szczepan Siekierka]] - not reliable, 9. [[Stanisław Jastrzębski]] (he is not the same you have found) - not reliable. 

Not reliable authors = not reliable crimes. This is your strategy. How about 150 thousands butchered Poles? They mourdered themselves? You are trying to whitewashing UIA and SS-Galizien becouse you are Ukrainian.--[[User:Paweł5586|Paweł5586]] ([[User talk:Paweł5586|talk]]) 07:02, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

::Please avoid racist comments and false accusations of editing in bad faith and stick to reliable sources.  When Yale historian, graduate of Oxford who also studied in Warsaw, Harvard, Paris and Vienna, and expert on Eastern Europe [[Timothy D. Snyder]] writes of Prus [http://web.mit.edu/CIS/www/migration/pubs/rrwp/9_resolve.html]: &quot;The propagandistic publications of Edward Prus are indefensible in this regard.&quot; I take that seriously.  I also take seriously the opinion of Polish historian [[Rafał Wnuk]] of the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in Lublin [http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:_hiHz9qZZPcJ:www.ciaonet.org/olj/int/int_0701b.pdf+wnuk+para+scientific&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;gl=us] when he writes &quot;The third, para-scientific trend consists of works that are of no scientific value. Their authors play freely with historical facts. They appeal mostly to the reader's emotions. Their use of sources and researchers' findings does not contribute to historical discoveries. Instead it is used to make their &quot;true&quot; version of events credible. It is often only politically involved publicism, not historical work. Edward Prus, Aleksander Korman, and Jacek E. Wilczur are followers of this trend.&quot; He also writes: &quot;In the third, &quot;non-scientific&quot; trend there is a group represented by E. Prus, A.Korman and J. Wilczor. They all strongly support the idea that one cannot talk about a Polish-Ukrainian conflict, but only about the genocide of Poles by Ukrainian nationalists. Works by these authors are written in the form of a lampoon. E.Prus's and J.Wilczor's books do not include footnotes and have only bibliographies. This prevents a reader from confirming facts which are often more than doubtful. For instance, in one of his books E.Prus writes that in Sachryn, near Hrubieszow, Ukrainians murdered each other. However, all of Polish historiography and the memories of Home Army soldiers state clearly that it was an action of Polish underground.&quot; Just because you can list 8 or 80 names of unreliable sources doesn't make then more reliable.  Reliability doesn't depend on sheer numbers.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 12:52, 2 September 2009 (UTC) 

:: This is one-sided view on historians, Wnuk is involved to. He was criticized. And what about Siemaszko, Filar, Szczepański there is nothing against them except bad will.

There were no 4th and 5th regiments in the division so how is this accurate ? --[[User:Jim Sweeney|Jim Sweeney]] ([[User talk:Jim Sweeney|talk]]) 07:59, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

This regiments have same command and nationality squad as SS-Galizien, there were no diffrence beetwen them. Regiments were numbered from 4 to 8, this means it is continuation of 1-3 as SS-Galizien, after Brody battle some SS-Galizien troops also made some atrocities.--[[User:Paweł5586|Paweł5586]] ([[User talk:Paweł5586|talk]]) 13:12, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

:The division regiment were not numbered 1 2 3 and just because they were the same nationality does not mean they were responsible all SS and Police were under the same command [[HSSPF]]. The way to prove your claim is to provide an orbat of the division that includes the 4th to 8th SS Police regiments. --[[User:Jim Sweeney|Jim Sweeney]] ([[User talk:Jim Sweeney|talk]]) 15:44, 2 September 2009 (UTC) 


== Huta Pieniacka ==

The section on Huta Pieniacka and the claim from the Polish historian [[Grzegorz Motyka (historian)]] seems conclusive that it was the 4th and 5th SS police regiments that were involved in this action. Unless a reliable source in English can prove otherwise this section needs deleting as it has nothing to do with the division.--[[User:Jim Sweeney|Jim Sweeney]] ([[User talk:Jim Sweeney|talk]]) 15:40, 2 September 2009 (UTC)
:I respectfully disagree because other sources state otherwise.

::::You make some good points.   I hesitate to support removal of this section, however, due to notability.  Even if the accusations are false, they are prominant enough to warrant inclusion.

Russian sources (Chuyev) also state that it was the 4th and 5th SS Police regiments that took part in the action. They are often mixed up with the SS Galizien Division because they were also often called Galizien. However, when I put this in previously it was removed.  21:47, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

So perhaps the article should read that it was the police regiments who did this although some sources claim incorrectly that the Division did so, and describe the reason for the confusion.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 22:12, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

==[[WP:UNDUE|Undue Weight]]==
We should keep something in mind when describing the massacres conducted by approximately 800 men (less than 5% of the Division's strength), in 2 months in 1944, who were seperated from the Division and placed under non-Division command while committing those crimes. [[WP:UNDUE]] states:
:&quot;Undue weight applies to more than just viewpoints. Just as giving undue weight to a viewpoint is not neutral, so is giving undue weight to other verifiable and sourced statements. An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements.&quot;

I argued against removal of massacre info when Jim Sweeney felt it did not belong here - clearly it should be mentioned, particularly Huta Pieniacka. However when this stuff becomes as lengthy as other sections (such as the Division's battles in Austria) we are violating the principle of undue weight.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 13:35, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;Alleged&quot; War crimes ==

Could editors explain why documented crimes committed by this SS unit were described as &quot;alleged&quot;? Thank you.--[[User:Jacurek|Jacurek]] ([[User talk:Jacurek|talk]]) 03:03, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
:If by &quot;this SS unit&quot; you mean the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galicia you are incorrect.  The documented crimes were by elements of the 4th and 5th regiments not by the unit as a whole. By numbers, those elements made up about 5% or so of the 14th's total strength. Your edit summary is also innaccurate, as with the exception of some of the German personnel the Divison's soldiers were not members of the Nazi Party. Even the Division's Chief of Staff, Wolf-Dietrich Heike, who transferred in directly from the Wehrmacht, was not a member of the party. Referring to the Division or its members as &quot;Nazis&quot; is a bit like referring to every Soviet soldier during World War II as a &quot;Bolshevik&quot; or &quot;Stalinist.&quot; Innacurate and inflammatory.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 03:34, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
::Was this unit involved in any war crimes such as murder of the civilians, Jews etc? --[[User:Jacurek|Jacurek]] ([[User talk:Jacurek|talk]]) 03:57, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
:::Which unit?[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 03:59, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
::::14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galicia.--[[User:Jacurek|Jacurek]] ([[User talk:Jacurek|talk]]) 04:05, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
:::::The &quot;14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galicia&quot; was not involved in war crimes such as murder of civilians, Jews, etc. no more than, say the &quot;U.S. Army&quot; was involved in the [[My Lai Massacre]]. In each case individual units were responsible. Specificallty, in the case of 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galicia, the 4th and 5th Police Regiments were involved in the massacres of a few Polish villages while in the course of their anti-partisan activities (actually, there is no evidence that Jews were being killed en masse by these two regiments, although Jews residing in them probably were along with everyone else). These elements of the Division responsible for the atrocities were not even under Divisional command at the time of the crimes - they were removed from the Division and placed under German police command, then returned to the Division once their mission was over. By numbers, about 95% of the Divison's personnel ''weren't'' involved in those massacres. 
:::::All of the above, of course, is irrelevent with respect to referring to the Division as &quot;Nazi&quot; which is as inaccurate and inflammatory as refering to World War II Soviet soldiers as &quot;Stalinist.&quot;[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 04:24, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
::::::Faustian, I'm assuming that all you wrote is correct since you know about their history more than I do. I also understand the complex Ukrainian WW2 history and the reasons which attracted Ukrainians into German SS divisions. However at the same time I honestly sense a little attempt of whitewashing Ukrainian SS crimes. For example: ''they were removed from the Division and placed under German police command, then returned to the Division once their mission was over'' Still they were the same people. People who committed crimes already but under different command. What or who stopped them from continuing murdering civilians. Did they have special instruction to be &quot;special&quot; and do not murder civilians unlike all other SS ? And then that no Nazis claim? They did serve the Nazis, they fought for the Nazi cause and it is common to call SS formations the Nazis. You see where I'm coming from? This is my honest opinion Faustian and I'm not trying to prove anything I just saying what I feel.--[[User:Jacurek|Jacurek]] ([[User talk:Jacurek|talk]]) 05:29, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
::::::::Which crimes, specifically, am I &quot;whitewashing&quot;? The sources tell us the German police needed troops and ''against the Division's protests'' &quot;borrowed&quot; a number of poorly trained new recruits, several hundreds of whom (out of a total of 12,000 in the Division, and 10,000 in a reserve pool) committed atrocities while engaging in partisan warfare (these sorts of disgusting tragedies aren't that rare in guerrilla warfare - just think of [[My Lai Massacre]] in Viet Nam which was ''very'' similar to Huta Pieniacka). I don't deny or minimize these crimes, indeed I clarify them. 
::::::::Have you read this article? What kind of people [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Waffen_Grenadier_Division_of_the_SS_Galizien_(1st_Ukrainian)#The_Division.27s_Support joined the Division] (basically, Ukrainians opposed to Bandera although later Banderists did infiltrate in large numbers) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Waffen_Grenadier_Division_of_the_SS_Galizien_(1st_Ukrainian)#Organizing_the_Division who organized it]?  I am not familar with &quot;all other SS&quot;, which units committed crimes and which units did not. What is relevent here is what this particular Division and its members did. The evidence links approximately 5% of its personnel to a handful of massacres of civilians that occurred during anti-partisan operations. &quot;Serving Nazis&quot; does not make one a Nazi, no more than &quot;serving Stalin&quot; in the Soviet army makes one a &quot;Stalinist.&quot; If someone is not a member of the Nazi party or a supporter of the Nazi party or Nazi principles he is not a Nazi. Period. The Division's last Commander, [[Pavlo Shandruk]], received the [[Virtuti Militari]] from [[Władysław Anders]].  Are you telling us that Anders gave the highest Polish military medal to a Nazi? Added by [[user:Faustian|Faustian]] 06:31, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
:::::::::Fair answer.--[[User:Jacurek|Jacurek]] ([[User talk:Jacurek|talk]]) 06:56, 16 September 2009 (UTC)

Oof. Ok. Just to get one thing out of the way, Shandruk received the VM from Anders for his part in the defense of Poland in 1939, not anything to do with this division. Just so we're clear on that. Other than that, I do agree that this is essentially an issue of undue weight. Some members of the division participated in the massacre - however, the argument that this kind of thing happens all the time in 'anti-partisan operations' or guerrilla warfare is no excuse. Likewise IIRC, some members of the [[Kaminski Brigade]] who were involved in atrocities during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] were also incorporated into this division later on (as well as Vlasov). So the division at various points in its existence did include some '''small''' but '''not insignificant''' proportion of individuals guilty of war crimes (5% to 20% sounds about right, at a quick glance), at Huta and elsewhere. However, I think it's correct that these war crimes were perpetrated w/o the approval, order or any kind of inspiration from the Ukrainian commanders of the division and as such do not comprise a defining characteristic of this division. So the concern of UNDUE WEIGHT is a legitimate one. Just looking at the article it seems that this massacre is in fact over emphasized here. 

Of course sometimes the shoe is on the other foot and there's definitely some material in, for example, the [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia]], which, for very similar reasons is undue in that article. I'm talking about the emphasis on a couple of &quot;My Lai&quot; events (actually I think that's a bad analogy, but I'm not gonna go into that), which supposedly happen &quot;all the time&quot; in this kind of warfare, perpetrated by a few rogue Polish underground units, against the explicit orders of their command, which are served up as &quot;background&quot; for the killings of Poles that took place. 

So. Please remember that what is true in one article, is also true in another. Please try to stay objective. Speaking of which, since these disputes involve multiple articles, but same arguments and issues, it might be a good idea if folks started making their way over here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2009-09-15/Polish-Ukrainian_WWII_disputes] to discuss things.[[User:Radeksz|radek]] ([[User talk:Radeksz|talk]]) 07:02, 16 September 2009 (UTC)

:Excellent points, though I suspect the figures of war criminals are closer to 5% than 20%. Divisional leaders (both Ukrainian and German) went to great lengths to try to screen and keep out criminal elements, which Germans outside the Division tried to insert into the Division, although they were not always sucessful in doing so. I realize you are quite busy with respect to German-Polish issues but your input is very highly valued on the Ukrainian-Polish stuff, at least by me. I certinly wouldn't object to moving this entire conversation into the mediation cabal section.
:On a seperate note related to the Division's background, while Snyder describes the Division as largely the project of OUN-M, the historian John Armstrong of [[Columbia University]] states that the Division's chief organizer and higherst ranking Ukrainian officer was Dmytro Paliiv, a former member of Poland's interwar parliament, former member of the anti-OUN [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO]] movement and opponent of OUN terrorism. Melnyk's book contains a passage about Himmler's inspection of the Division and his speech to Division officers:
::&quot;There is something I want to tell you: obedience starts the moment you receive an order to do something you find unpleasant. I know if I ordered the Division to exterminate the Poles in this area or that area, I would be a very popular man. But if I tell you or give you the order that the Division is to follow this or that route to the front in full battle order, and fight against the Russians, then that is what will be done, for the Führer will manage to handle the Poles alright- who have ill-treated you in the same way as they have ill-treated our fellow Germans in Poland. You do nothing before the order is given...&quot;
::To which Paliiv, who was present as the spokesman for the Ukrainian officers, replied: &quot;&quot;Let it be permissible in your presence, Herr Reichsführer, for me to state that we Ukrainians are not preparing to slaughter the Poles, and that is not why we voluntarily enlisted into the division Galicia. But after observing German  policies in eastern Europe, we cannot fail to cite how you Germans continue to incite us against the Poles and the Poles against us. I feel that it is necessary to inform you that your Policies in eastern Europe are not correct and lead to nothing good. Forgive me for such an unpleasant rebuttal, but that is the way it is&quot;. 
::Melnyk then wrote: In the absence of any record of Himmler's reaction to Paliiv's comment, it may be assumed that he bore the embarrassment stoically enough at the time.  However, such impudence from a Ukrainian whom Himmler considered to be his racial inferior is hardly likely to have gone unnoticed. It may also explain why a few days after his visit Himmler issued the following order to the Chief of the security Polizei  and SD (Security and intelligence Service) designed to disassociate the Ukrainians from the elite SS establishment once and for all;
::&quot;In the criminal report of the Reichssicherheits-Hauptamtes of 26.5.44, reference is made to a Ukrainian SS man under item 2. This should be correctly defined as a Ukrainian serving in the combat units of the SS.
::I ask you to ensure that the term &quot;SS Man&quot;, which is so precious and highstanding to us, is avoided in all reports, as well as in all official and non-official announcements concerning the people of foreign race which we today organise under the order of the SS.&quot;
:I have read a rumor that Paliiv, who died at Brody, had been assassinated by the Germans rather than being killed in combat.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 13:37, 16 September 2009 (UTC)

== A significant percentage of ethnic Poles in SS-Galizien?==
''but initially it also included a '''significant percentage of ethnic Poles''', some Slovaks and Czechs and incorporated Dutch volunteers and officers[1].''- No other source mentions it. And if the percentage of ethnic Poles was really that significant, it should have been noticed by historians researching this subject. The book is very hard to get. Are you able to provide a copy of the mentioned page - Kleitmann K. G. Die Waffen SS; eine Dokumentation. Osnabreuck, Der Freiwillige, 1965 p. 183, Bandurist? It would be very helpful. Maybe Volksdeutche were taken for ethnic Poles. There were up to 100,000 volunteers and up to 30,000 members, therefore a &quot;significant percentage&quot; would equal thousands of the Poles – and that would be very hard to overlook. Although it also depends what a &quot;significant percentage&quot; means.--[[User:Hedviberit|Hedviberit]] ([[User talk:Hedviberit|talk]]) 00:47, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

:Perhaps the source means citizens of prewar Poland, which was a country with several minorities.

[[User:Tymek|Tymek]] ([[User talk:Tymek|talk]]) 01:52, 1 October 2009 (UTC)

Ethnic Poles were indeed enlisted into the division Mark Rikmenspoel, Waffen SS Encyclopedia, page 190 and also Gordon Williamson, SS Hitler's Instrument of Terror, pages 123-4 mentions Poles alongside Ukrainians. That I guess is the reason the Germans were so adiment to call it the Galizien division. It was only later that the division became almost exclusively Ukrainian. Ukrainian sources tend to avoid mantioning the fact that ethnic Poles were in the division. I asked one of the choristers in my Men's choir who was in the division. Hea slo confirmed that there were ethnic Poles in the division initially. --[[User:Bandurist|Bandurist]] ([[User talk:Bandurist|talk]]) 19:04, 8 October 2009 (UTC)
:Ethnic Poles (unlike ethnic Ukrainians) were considered to be &quot;subhumans&quot; by the Nazi standards and were not admissible into the SS. The &quot;Poles&quot; you are referring to are either [[Volksdeutsche]] or other pre war Polish citizens (Masurians or people from Slask etc.) who were not pure Poles to the Germans.--[[User:Jacurek|Jacurek]] ([[User talk:Jacurek|talk]]) 19:44, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

There is no mention of Volksdeutch. However, the SS really lowered their requirements, scraping the bottom of the barrel. Reading about the training that the volunteers had, a good number could not read nor write because of the &quot;education&quot; they received between the wars left many of them illiterate, and as a result a lot of time was spent just getting the volunteers sufficiently literate to read orders. Many of the ethnic Poles however, who had previous Polsih military service, were placed in positions as NCO's because they were literate. This caused alot of friction in what some saw as a &quot;Ukrainian&quot; division. --[[User:Bandurist|Bandurist]] ([[User talk:Bandurist|talk]]) 20:29, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

:Sure they can.

::The Landwehr book seems to be just a restatement of previously published materials I have found in other books, but written in a readable style. He does seem to feel that the soldiers of the SS were something special physically, and although he does not praise them directly, tends to point out all the positives and rarely reflects on negatives.

lol, can you show me book with Holocaust-denying in Nortom? You didnt read any book from Nortom and you are first to crticize. For your information, Siekierka and Komański arent very rich, they researched UPA crimes since 1990. After up to 10 years collecting recollections of survivors they published their book. Thats all, Nortom had nothing to his research, his results were also published in &quot;Na Rubieży&quot; magazine.--[[User:Paweł5586|Paweł5586]] ([[User talk:Paweł5586|talk]]) 18:32, 28 September 2009 (UTC)

:Hmm, I can take your word for itabout Nortom - the word of someone who keeps placing info cited from Nortom books in various articles - or I can use a reliable source, the The Steven Roth Institute for the study of Contemporary Antisemitism Racism at the [[University of Tel Aviv]] which states [http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2000-1/poland.htm in this article] &quot;antisemitic, Holocaust distorting, as well as Holocaust denying, books published by Rekonkwista, Rachocki, Nortom or Antyk can often be found on the shelves of respectable bookshops. After intervention by the anti-fascist Never Again Association, antisemitic publications of the Nortom publishing house were removed from the official Polish exhibition at the international book fair in Frankfurt/Main in November 2000. Nevertheless, Nortom’s books are still regularly exhibited at numerous book fairs organized in Poland.&quot; It's pretty bad that Nortom books are widely read in Poland; we certainly shouldn't use them for wikipedia articles. But if you disagree I will gladly open an RFC on this and we can then get input from others. As for Siekerka and Komanski - are they historians or just guys that gathered &quot;information&quot; which was then published not by a reputable publisher but by Nortom. According to the [[Szczepan Siekierka|wikipedia article]], Siekerka is a poliical activist while Komanski is a veteran of Polish self-defence forces in Volyn. We don't know if Komanski personally killed any Ukrainian civilians, but according to Yale historian [[Timothy Snyder]] Polish self-defence forces murdered many Ukrainian civilians in Volyn. The proof, in a book published by Yale University Press, can be directly accessed though googlebooks [[http://books.google.com/books?id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=timothy+snyder+27th+infantry+division#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false here, first paragraph]. So again, does a book written by a political activist coauthored by a man who belonged to a military organization that murdered civilians, published not by a university press but by a publisher known for antisemitic Polish nationalist works, get to be treated as a reliable source for purposes of wikipedia articles? I think not.   [[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 05:42, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

::Polish Self-defence was made to protect innocent civilians, try to rembemer that. There were some accidents and revenges against Ukrainian civilians, but it wasnt a very often. In other side UPA had been created to destroy polish population, killing innocent woman and children were a '''main activity''' of UPA members. From UPA hands died few thousand German soldiers, 8340 Soviet solidiers and 2732 representative of soviet authorities (according to Motyka) while UPA mourdered up to 100 000 thousand civilians. '''So stop compared UPA and Polish self-defence, its awful'''. Second I told you that Siekierka and Komański arent nationalists, and their book was reviewed, and were used by historians as source for description of many events. There aresnt any book in Nortom who denied Holocaust, you can find many sorts of books e.g. about [[Pope John Paul II]].

:::Thanks for offering your opinion about Polish self-defence forces which killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians. I have no doubt that Nortom, which publishes anti-semitic, anti-German and anti-Ukrainian works (the three ethnic groups whom the Polish National Democratic Party persecuted in the 1930's) would include info about Jews being killed by UPA.  BTW, I probably added more information about Ukrainian nationalists murdering Jews than have you or most other editors - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia#Policies_conducted_by_Nazi_Germany_.281941.E2.80.931943.29 here is the section I wrote].

::::Yes, I wrote much of that well-referenced section also. Some Jews were indeed murdered by UPA, although they seem to have been &quot;collatioral damage&quot; rather than specific targets - they were hiding in Polish villages and were the murdered along with everyone else in the village. In at least one documented case (I don't have time to dig this up) the Jews in the a village were taken out and spared, watching their Polish neighbors getting killed.  Have you heard of Stella Krenzbach?  There is an article about her in Polish wikiepdia [http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_Krenzbach here]. She wrote, in her memoirs, &quot;&quot;I attribute the fact that I am alive today and devoting all the strength of my thirty-eight years to a free Israel only to God and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. I became a member of the heroic UPA on 7 November 1943. In our group I counted twelve Jews, eight of whom were doctors.&quot; Basically the relationship between UPA and OUN and Jews was complex - the OUN in the German police helped the Germans kill 200,000 Jews (they did play more of a supporting rather than direct role, but learned and applied thiose lessons towards the Poles) while also saving Jewish families and Jewish individuals when they were no longer motivated by the an alliance with Germany to help the Germans. As a German report indicated, the OUN was willing to eiother help or kill Jews, whichever they felt was more useful.  But really, all of this has nothing to do with the 14th Galician Division, Nortom or Landwehr.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 14:43, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

You didnt answer on my questions, maybe this is well-referenced, but for sure this section didnt mention about many facts: 6 thousand Jews [[Lviv pogroms|killed in Lwów]], 1210 Jews killed during massacres of Poles at Volhynia•, did you know SB OUN orders about liqudation Jews in Volhynia, do you know that those Jews who were saved by UPA, was used to work for UPA, then killed. Read 17 paragraph of OUN-B resolution (April 1941 in [[Kraków]]) - ''Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists fighting the Jews as the support, Moscow-Bolshevik regime, and realizing the popular masses, that Moscow is the main enemy''. Do you know how many Ukrainians were killes by self-defence? Unfortunately you see those facts you want to see, and you dont belive in many facts becouse you dont read other side point of view.

•Lviv pogroms you mention were 1941 - before the division - those topics should be mentioned elsewhere (such as here : [[Ukrainische Gruppe Nachtigall]] )&lt;br&gt;
•Volyhnia is already discussed and is nothing to do with the division - (see here : [[Volhynia massacre]])
It would be better if the article was simply limited to the times that the division existed, there are plenty of other places where the massacres are discussed at length, and unreliable sources are not to be included.&lt;br&gt;
At this point in time the article has been chopped and changed so many times that it resembles Galicia itself, fought over by so many different sides that people did not know to whom it belonged.&lt;br&gt;
Despite several major attempts at neutral editing, warring that resulted in several editora being disciplined and general arguing for months on end the article now looks like it has been written by idiots - This is tragic the article has turned to shit and needs some serious work on it.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On that day, early in the morning, soldiers of this division, dressed in white, masking outfits, surrounded the village&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:If that is true, and the details are to be believed, then how did they know what force these soldiers were from ?

:This is the only mention of the documents that specifies anything about what they contain :-
&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the documents, there is a fragment of the &quot;Chronicle of February 25th, 1944.

However, it is difficult to regard the statement as true. The 'Chronicle' does not indicate which German troops committed the crime.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Spring 1944 Regiments 4 and 5 were transferred to 14th SS, as were personnel from Regiments 6 and 7.

:@Chaosdruid, soldiers came to village and people recognized them. There were few survivors. Second thing is that, 23 February (ealier), a patrol of 4 r. Galizien were attacked near Huta Pieniacka by Polish AK. 2 soldiers were killed, and they got Galizien uniforms. An UPA unit came with help. This solders were buried in Brody, and the official chronicle of Galizien recognized them as first Galizien dead in &quot;battle field&quot;. In funeral governor [[Otto Wächter|Wachter]] said: ''Stoimy tu nad zwłokami dwóch poległych, pierwszych poległych Galicyjskich SS-manów'' it means &quot;We stand here on the two dead bodies, first killed the SS Galician&quot; - newspaper: Lwiwski Wisti, 4.III.1944, in: Kwestia ukraińska i eksterminacja ludności polskiej w Małopolsce Wschodniej, Lucyna Kulińska i Adam Roliński, Kraków 2004, p. 322-323.

After 23 February skirmish, Germans sents more troops from 4 regiment to Huta and they made massacre.

Some explanations:
* There were many volunteers (about 80 th.) so Germans wanted to create more divisions (later they recall this idea).
* So Germans created 5 police regiments (4-8), and allocated them from division and send in to anti partisan actions. But (its very important) numbers these regiments started from 4 (not from 1)! This is final evidence: 
**Waffen-Grenadier-Regiment der SS 29 (galizisches Nr. 1)
**Waffen-Grenadier-Regiment der SS 30 (galizisches Nr. 2)
**Waffen-Grenadier-Regiment der SS 31 (galizisches Nr. 3)
**Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Regiment 4 (Polizei)
**Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Regiment 5 (Polizei)
**Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Regiment 6 (Polizei)
**Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Regiment 7 (Polizei)
**Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Regiment 8 (Polizei)
Full name of regiments created in 1943 were: Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Regiment - same name had division in 1943:''' SS Freiwilligen Division &quot;Galizien&quot; - from August 1943 to 27 July 1944 (during training)

The problem is that officialy this regiments were separated, but in fact soldiers 4-8 were were considered to be part of the Division SS-Galicia. The official Chronicle of SS-Galicia considered as the first killed soldiers Division Galicia members of the 4th regiment (they were killed in Huta Pieniacka 23 February 1944).

::::You say that &quot; they were recognised&quot; but that refers to the first time when two were attacked ? Is it possible that the villagers knew every soldier of the division ? I think not (remember the official report you quote say they were wearing white so they couldnt see their uniforms)
::::You say &quot;and a UPA unit came to help&quot; when was that exactly ? surely not when the division were there as they would have had to fight them also ? Is it not possible that it was the UPA speaking in their native Ukrainian that came and committed the massacre ? Is it not possible that it was the Poilce that came and did this act of barbarism ? Surely the fact that the documentation from Ukrainian archives about the 14th SS contradicts the Polish Institution account would also support the facts in the divisions records that they only were responsible for the original two deaths after their initial encounters.
::::Yes, the &quot;Galizien Freiwilligen&quot; refers to all Ukrainians freely in the armed forces, the Police, the special police and the division. It is not correct to assume that just because they were freiwilligen means that they were in the division 14th SS.

* Accordingly to TESSIN  - Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Division has 1-7 regiments; 4-7 regiment were under  [[Ordnungspolizei]] command; 6 and 7 Galizisches SS-Freiwilligen-Rgt folded into division by 31/01/44 Order. 4-5 Galizisches SS-Freiwilligen-Rgt folded into Gal. Ausb.Rgt. 14 (training and replenishment regiment of the division) per order 9. 6.1944. In August 1944 division was restored to 10K  from   Gal. Ausb.Rgt. 14.
That's actually explained the fact why it never used as front-line unit after August 1944.

* The very question is : were the Galizisches SS-Freiwilligen-Rgt 4 to 8 under military command of Fritz Freitag as a part of 14th Waffen SS Grenadier Division of SS or they were  Galizisches SS-Freiwilligen-Rgtn in structure of  Ordnungspolizei  under police command of BdO and SS-Polizei-Fuhrer.

There is out of discussion, that Galizisches SS-Freiwilligen-Rgt 4 (Polizei) and Galizisches SS-Freiwilligen-Rgt 5 (Polizei) were responsible for war crimes agains civilians. The question is - under Ordnugspolizei or Waffen SS command.

As I said before, 23 February a patrol of 4 regiment fighted with Huta Pieniacka selfdefence and AK subunit (they were sent to Huta Pieniacka becouse a few days ealier some Russian partisants had camped in HP). There were two Ukrainian soldiers dead. An UPA unit had helped them so they were able to withdraw. This fact is confirmed by Polish IPN, historians. This two man were buried in Brody. At funeral Wachter said about first two SS- Division Galizien members killed in battle field. This is confirmed by newspaper - Lwiwski Wisti and Swatomir Fortson. Sources are above. Same regiment was sent 28 February to Huta Pieniacka, and together with UPA unit, and some nearby Ukrainian villagers made massacre. 

You said: ''Accordingly to TESSIN  - Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Division has 1-7 regiments'', so is this next proof that 4-7 r. were part od SS-Galizien?--[[User:Paweł5586|Paweł5586]] ([[User talk:Paweł5586|talk]]) 21:18, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

For me best proof about regiments is a fact that there werent any Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Regiment 1-3 (Polizei). Numeration started from 4. It seems to natural continuation: Waffen-Grenadier-Regiment der SS 29 (galizisches Nr. 1), Waffen-Grenadier-Regiment der SS 30 (galizisches Nr. 2), Waffen-Grenadier-Regiment der SS 31 (galizisches Nr. 3), Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Regiment 4 (Polizei)...

:I think we need to adopt one fact given in source above -  Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Division became 14. Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS (gal. Nr. 1) in August 1944 - before such date it was Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Division which without any doubts has 1-7 regiments. Could you agree - when we mentions - 14. Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS (gal. Nr. 1) which appeared in August 1944 - regiments names Waffen-Grenadier-Regiment der SS 29 (galizisches Nr. 1), Waffen-Grenadier-Regiment der SS 30 (galizisches Nr. 2), Waffen-Grenadier-Regiment der SS 31 (galizisches Nr. 3), - correct - at same when we mention period prer August 1944 - mentioning of such names are incorrect - becouse Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Division has  1-7 regiments SS Freiwilligen Regiment. Does I'm clear? While if we spoken about the personnel  - it's almost the same persons. So as for August 1944 14th Waffen SS Grenadier Division of SS= remnants of the 14. Galizisches SS Freiwilligen Division (up to 3K) + Gal. Ausb.Rgt. 14 (training and replenishment regiment of the division) which actually was an  4th + 5th +6 +7 +8 SS Freiwilligen Regiments (up to 4.5-5 K)

Die Gliederung der Division mit drei Regimentern ist eindeutig. Der Umstand, dass das Personal der anderen 4 bzw. 5 &quot;galizischen&quot; Regimenter in die Division übernommen wurde, ändert daran nichts, da besagte Einheiten eindeutig der Ordnungspolizei unterstellt und nie Bestandteil der SS-Division Galizien waren. --Quasimodogeniti 19:36, 10.

You cannot say that the divisions history is lying WITHOUT PROOF just because the Ukrainian version is written by the division themselves and that the german one is correct just because it was written by a single man that you believe knows more than the men themselves.

The fact is this - the book written by Logusz, which is one of THE authoratitive works is written by a University educated man with 2 degrees, states that there were battalions that were not under division control right up to June 1944.

So you are denying, once again, that the author has no credibility even though he has two degrees a BA and an MA and his book is one of THE authoratative books on the 14th division. A quote or two from wikipedia guides to sources :-

&quot;Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources and, to a lesser extent, on tertiary sources.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Secondary sources write about primary sources, often making analytic or  evaluative claims about them.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
and one of the qualifiers is &quot;and books published by respected publishing houses&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

You also try to say that just because someone holds a military rank - what ? what are you trying to say ? THat someone in the reserves cannot have two degrees ? that because he is in the military he will lie ? what are you trying to say here?&lt;br /&gt;

I also would like to remind you of [[Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources#Overview|this]] - &quot;This means that we only publish the opinions of reliable authors, and  not the opinions of Wikipedians who have read and interpreted primary  source material for themselves. Secondary or tertiary sources are needed to establish the topic's  notability and to avoid novel interpretations of primary sources&quot;

And so you mention &quot;eventually incorporated&quot; - that means that they were not originally and you have to prove the time that they were. &quot;The '''burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material'''&quot;

If therefore, there is a conflicting opinion from a reliable trusted source, it would be POV to ignore Logusz, trying to discredit him and thereby get OR into the article. I am here trying to make sure neutrality is maintained and that facts are put in and not untrue statement. You have not convinced me that your statemnts are factually accurate - as Logusz states that there were battalions that were not included into the division as late as June 1944

Faustian &quot;4th and 5th regiments of the division SS-Galicia were subject not to  military but police authority.&quot;
Joodoe &quot;4-7 regiment were under Ordnungspolizei command;&quot;

THe links you send to Tessins books are not working for anyone that does not have a google books account

Is this correct:-

1 You are trying to say that the 14th SS was responsible for war crimes but you do not have the proof you need and Logusz disagrees with what you are saying - that all frewilligen were under control of 14th at the time.&lt;br/&gt;
2 Also that there are three statements from editors that suggest there were battalions and regiments that were also not under the control of the 14th&lt;br/&gt;
3 That you will not accept that there were such things as &quot;Rural police&quot; that were under police control&lt;br/&gt;
4 That you disagree with the [http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/en/19/188/Investigation_of_the_Crime_Committed_at_the_Village_of_Huta_Pieniacka.html Institute of National Rememberance] statements :-
&quot;Among the documents, there is a fragment of the &quot;Chronicle of  February 25th, 1944. Information inferred from the &quot;Chronicle&quot; remains  in contradiction to the hitherto established facts of the investigation.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;soldiers of this division, dressed in white, masking outfits&quot; &quot;...&quot;In the 'Chronicle' it says that these were other German troops, not  the entering 14th Division of SS 'Galizien'.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;In the fragments of 'The Chronicle of the 14th Division of SS  Galizien', there is the following entry on the criminal activity of  Ukrainian guerilla fighters: 'In the village of Demydkowycze, the  underground army fighters encountered the heavily fortified bunkers  nearby where Jews were hidden. The underground army fighters crushed the  bunkers. They killed two hundred Jews'.&quot;

AS for your comment &quot;It's really sorry&quot; once again I ask you to be civil and resist taunting...[[User:Chaosdruid|Chaosdruid]] ([[User talk:Chaosdruid|talk]]) 10:36, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

==Model and Kampfgruppe Beyersdorff==
A really strange claims (again originated from ''Michael O. Logusz Sterling, N.Y.-The writer is a major in the U.S. Army'') about ''SS Kampsgruppe performed its duty well enough that it earned the rare praise of German Field Marshal Walter Model'' - so per Newton, Steven H. (2006). Hitler's Commander: Field Marshal Walter Model – Hitler's Favorite General. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo. ISBN 0306813998 -
&lt;blockquote&gt;
on 29 January 1944, Walter Model' was urgently sent to command Army Group North, which two weeks earlier had seen its stranglehold on Leningrad broken by the Volkhov, Leningrad and 2nd Baltic Fronts. The situation was dire (a circumstance that Model would come to be familiar with): two of the three corps of the German Eighteenth Army had been shattered, and contact lost with the III SS Panzer Corps defending Narva.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On 30 March Model was placed in command of Army Group North Ukraine in Galicia, which was withdrawing under heavy pressure from Zhukov's 1st Ukrainian Front.
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

So per historian, professor at Delaware State University conclusion  [[Walter Model]] at the time slot- when  Kampfgruppe Beyersdorff actually was in action - was not there. While I suppose  it's clear that the [[Wehrmacht]] General and later [[Generalfeldmarschall]] does not care about SS police unit under command of the HSSPF der GG. I suggest such claims also need to be fixed - per historian, professor at Delaware State University data. Thanks[[User:Jo0doe|Jo0doe]] ([[User talk:Jo0doe|talk]]) 16:20, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

В книге рассказывается о предательской работе галицийских националистов против Российской империи. Впервые широкой читающей аудитории предъявлены свидетельства геноцида русского народа в Галиции и планомерного уничтожения всего русского на Западной Украине в первые десятилетия ХХ столетия.&quot; Translated: &quot;New topical work of Sergei Chuyev is a vivid look into the history of cooperation between Ukrainian volunteers with the enemies of Russia. The book tells of the treacherous work of the Galician nationalists against the Russian empire. For the first time the general reading audience presented evidence of genocide of the Russian people in Galicia and the genocide of the Russian people in Western Ukraine in the first decades of the twentieth century.&quot; Obviuously there were no substantial numbers of Russian people in western Ukraine and no evidence of an anti-Russian genocide there.

Given that this article is about the Division, that would seem to be a very notable fact to erase. Yet [[User:Jo0doe|Jo0doe]] did just that.  So why the erasure? It seems that this important piece of information was excluded in order to push a POV blaming the Division itself for this massacre.

In the original Ukrainian, it reads &quot;Далі у звіті йдется про жахливі методи знущання над людьми, які важко вигадати і у можливість яких водночас важко повірити.&quot; Googletranslate to English is clumsy - &quot;Next report ydetsya the horrible methods of abuse of people who are hard to come up and in the possibility that while hard to believe.&quot; My translation - Next the report goes on about horrible method of torture of people, which are hard to come up with and in whose likelihood it is at the same time difficult to believe.&quot; Jo0doe translated this, and place his translation in quotes, as &quot;difficult to invent by anyone excluding witnesses of the real event itself.&quot; This sort of subtle twisting of sources is not good.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 13:32, 29 September 2010 (UTC)

:I found the source online here: [http://www.druhasvetova.sk/view.php?cisloclanku=2009020005]. I note that [[User:Jo0doe|Jo0doe]] ([[User talk:Jo0doe|talk]]) seems to be, as usual, cherry picking the individual bits of information to push his PV and ignoring the rest when he describes this sources simply as &quot;about numerous war crimes at the time of the [[ Slovak National Uprising]].&quot; The source is about much more than that, but by that comment we know how the source would likely be misused by [[User:Jo0doe|Jo0doe]] ([[User talk:Jo0doe|talk]]). Please do not do that with sources.  

:Anyways, the article discusses the military activities first, suggesting those were the most improtant of the Division's activities in Slovakia.  The lengthy article describes numerous incidents (retaliatory shelling of villages in which civilians died, requistioning food supplies from villages which the authors add were not as bad as what the Communist partisans did, beating people, etc.) - no masacrs or such crimes similar to the [[Huta Pieniacka massacre]].  An excerpt thanks to googletranslate from the origianl Slovak: &quot;Apparently crime squad of Wittenmayerovej group also signed Kvačany burning village (northwest of Liptovsky Mikulas) 30 October 1944, the population which has been accused of supporting guerrillas. During direct artillery fire on the village was burnt 11 houses, killed three people (more have been injured) and five other seized and handed over to the hands of police-security services. [47] Such cases of retaliation against the Slovak population were rare, indeed, have been reported in other regions occupied 14th Halych division.  Similarly Haličania acted in some villages of the district of Zilina. There Podhorie 19th January 1945 Ukrainian platoon conducted house searches. &quot;Commander (Ukrainian), this unit has a list of suspects from the village,&quot; accused of partisan activities and for harboring Jews (8 persons), which showed the German headquarters in Lietavska Lucky. After their departure they went to the village of guerrillas and then another Ukrainian guard from the village grandmother. Of their clash at the hands of the Russian partisan Pavlova fell a Ukrainian SS man. Next day - 20 January 1945 was followed by retaliatory action. &quot;This day will remain in living memory Podhorie village&quot; - is set in the contemporary reports. &quot;Late afternoon that day, German troops rushed consisting mainly of Polish Ukrainians from all surrounding crew obkolesili village and some burst into the village and began to torture people. Foot of its citizens, is accused by German soldiers, some of the people shot horespomenutého soldier and therefore gave orders that all men boarded midst village, built a wall around them to school. Each of the citizens certainly calculated to be all shot. This did not happen, but the soldiers started beating the people most flagrant manner. [...] German barbarians began to kindle economic Stavisky citizens ... &quot;- seven barns were burned. [48] So, Communist guerrillas based in a village shot a Ukrainian soldier, in retaliation the village was captured, the men seperated from the women and tortured or beaten, and seven barns were burned. How mch weight should this an incident like this have, in order to be included in the article?  

:Importantly, who is the author/organization that put the info together? The article's author, Michal Smigal, couldn't be found on google. The organization publishing the info, Histroia Nostra, describes itself as &quot;organized rings of non-profit supporters of Slovak history 20th century. Its aim is to promote and develop the historical research, education and publishing activities, organization of cultural-educational events and popularization of history in the broadest sense.&quot; It doesn' seem to be affiliated with any academic organization.

:If the source were legit, info from the article should be incorporated into the article. Of course, it would be absurd to include every incident of barn burning or requisuitioning horses from villages  but a brief summary about military activity against Soviet partisans as well as the effects on the civilian population would be warranted - assuming the source is reliable per wikipedia standards.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 15:12, 11 October 2010 (UTC)

Nor do you deny that although civilians died when villages were shelled in retaliation for partisan attacks no massacres were committed.  Nor that the Division was with war crimes in Slovakia - and yet you claim &quot;numerous examples of the war crimes as described in same way at 14. divízia SS „Galizien“ na Slovensku (1944 – 1945): bojová protipartizánska činnosť a represálie P. Sokolovič. – Bratislava : Ústav pamäti národa, 2008&quot;. Please stop misusing sources to push your POV.

:::BTW, from the soure, info that you totally ignored:
::::pasted googletranslate:&quot;It is at this time (end of January 1945) in ensuring the long and gradual abandonment of the 14th Halych SS division began to appear more unidentified vlasovovské (Cossack) tulle unit - incidence and effect of which researchers often wrong issues and their bloody excesses were also credited to the account of the Ukrainian SS division. Their presence was as evident in the town of Zilina Podhorie district: &quot;In early February, around the German crew started to receive in front of our village and started to show what-so relief. But this did not last long, however, and instead of leaving the invaders, came second. They were Cossacks - Vlasovci. These, beasts in human form, began to relentlessly pursue our heroes - the partisans. &quot;[68] Also, knowledge of their occurrence have been captured from space Vyšná Boca:&quot; On 22 January 1945 on Monday night came to us Vlasovci. These I was most worried about not only because it had over three hundred horses and hay starts, but also because they did brutally - inhuman. [...] It was deplorable that, as the Russians in German uniforms and fought against their own. Therefore, they are very hated partisans and Ca as family izmennikov - renegades homeland. &quot;[69] In another place:&quot; The Germans and Vlasovci arriving in the village looted by people who could. Vlasovci in the month of April 1945 burned down the house Paul Hippo, where he stayed and Stephen Čuboň, príduc after the weapons were stored there. Vlasovci opened fire, helped push the shootout ... Paul's mother hippo conquered, exiled from the village to which she returned after liberation. &quot;[70] Most probably (as suggested historian M. Uhrin) in this case the 580th battalion East riding of Section (580th Ost-Reiter-abtailung) under the command of Major. Kalamorza. The presence of troops in the area vlasovovských Liptov Turca, Orava, Kysuce and central Považie was recorded from late January until the arrival of the Eastern Front in the area in April 1945, ie at a time when 14th SS Division was already outside the territory of Slovakia.&quot; Basically, the Russians were much worse and Russian criems were incorectly attributed to the Division.
::::About looting, again a googletranslation: &quot;It should be noted, however, that such violations are perpetrated by a number of troops passing Slovak counties. As the show period records, &quot;an army passes, and Ukrainian, German and Hungarian as, in large húfoch and the military transports and friction on the carts and motor vehicles, prenocovávajú the villages. Citizenship, lying in villages on the main road Zilina - Trencin and Bystrica - Bradford, suffers greatly those passing troops, because where are stopped, there ruthlessly take feed and straw, reflecting locks humien, stables, and SOPs, and guilty of theft in inns and private homes. &quot;[73] It should also be added, while in several cases in Slovakia, the German military headquarters intervened and remove offenses from their own ranks, it was worse with the Slovak partisans who perpetrated the same crimes. Guerrillas operating in the mountains and forests in Slovakia &quot;forfeited some village residents and require food, clothing, drinks, money and also pigs, cattle and horses. Such prepadávania is rampant and the population is completely helpless against this, &quot;- has been reported from different cities in Slovakia.&quot; [74] etc.
:::So the summary of this source with respect to anti-civilian activites would be that in helping to crush partisans during the Slovak uprising in Slovakia, elements of the Division sporadically cooperated with Sonderkommando and Einsatzkommando, shelled villages in retaliatory strikes that resulted in civilian deaths, beat or interrogated people, and along with other armed forces but to a lesser degree than the partisans themselves confiscated grain and livestock from the civilian population.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 16:54, 11 October 2010 (UTC)

*'''Oppose:''' This technical request has been brought here for discussion. The title you are requesting does not put 'Galizien' in italics, so maybe you wish to consider a further change. I am unclear whether we even need 'Galician' in the article title. If may be of interest to look at the corresponding titles in the German, French and Spanish Wikipedias. Per [[WP:PRECISE]] we don't need to include more words in the title than are necessary for identification of the topic. Why are you calling this division 'Ukrainian' when the whole point for the Nazis of using the Galician terminology was to avoid using Ukrainian? The title of our German article is [[:de:14. Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS (galizische Nr. 1)]] , i.e. it does use Galician but it doesn't use 'Ukrainian.' [[User:EdJohnston|EdJohnston]] ([[User talk:EdJohnston|talk]]) 00:00, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose:''' IMO, this article should be at [[:14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)]]. Italics can be done with the display title template, it shouldn't be done with a move. I have a little bit of knowledge on this issue, having taken four non-Germanic Waffen SS division articles to FA. The original name of the division was the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician), and it did all its fighting (of pretty negligible value) under that name. The reality is that this title was used because Himmler couldn't bring himself to openly acknowledge that he had recruited a division of ''untermensch'' into the Waffen-SS. In early 1945, while it was refitting after being decimated in the Brody-Tarnow pocket, the bit in parentheses was changed to (1st Ukrainian) as a concession to the Ukrainian nationalists that made up the division. The above is drawn from Stein 1984, pp. 185–187, Stein being one of the foremost neutral scholars on the Waffen SS. We could use either, as MILMOS states we can use either the name is was best known under, or its last one. I'd prefer the former, because that was the name it fought under, and is best known as, and it demonstrates the duplicity of the Germans.

*'''Support as nominator''' Other divisions has their 'nicknames' with them. Galizien stands for nickname. (Like 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne, 24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstjäger or 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg) &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Elmasmelih|Elmasmelih]] ([[User talk:Elmasmelih|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Elmasmelih|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
:It is not in any way a &quot;nickname&quot;. It is an integral part of the name of the division, and it has a specific meaning (in terms of where it was recruited). Albanian, Galacian, Croatian, Hungarian, etc. Please have a look at the reliable sources.

*'''Comment'''. The actual formation didn't have a name in the English language, therefore all we offer are the possible translations with grammar based on (more-less) reliable third-party sources drawn from literature in the English language. If you look closely at the article in the German Wikipedia, you will notice that the formation changed its original German name four times in less than two years. All of the names were (at one point or another) their real designations including ''the last one'' ... no longer in the SS, but in the Ukrainian National Army. 
:*SS-Schützendivision &quot;Galizien&quot; (Mai 1943)
:*14. SS-Freiwilligen-Division &quot;Galizien&quot; (30. Juni bis 22. Oktober 1943)
:*14. Galizische SS-Freiwilligen-Division (22. Oktober 1943 bis 27. Juni 1944)

:The article is not about the 1st Ukrainian Division of the Ukrainian National Army (25 April 1945 - ) therefore ''the last name'' in the SS would probably be most appropriate.[http://www.webcitation.org/5gQrFH4OY] How to translate?

:*[[WP:MILMOS#UNITNAME]] is more specific. It states that ''A name originally in a language other than English should be adapted by translating common terms (such as designations of size and type) and transliterating the remainder of the name.'' and ''When a unit or base has had multiple names over the course of its existence, the title should generally be the last name used; however, exceptions can be made in cases where the subject is clearly more commonly known by one of the previous names.'' I suggest that this division is more commonly known as (1st Galician), the name under which it did all its fighting, rather than (1st Ukrainian) which was a sop to the Ukrainian nationalists and only happened when the division was refitting. It did not see action after the name change. Regards, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 00:33, 9 July 2014 (UTC)

== ...not been found guilty of any war crimes by any war tribunal or commission ==

I checked with &quot;Judgment of the International Military Tribunal For The Trial of German Major War Criminals&quot; and the following statement seems to be incorrect and should be removed:

&quot;Although the Galizien Division has '''not been found guilty of any war crimes by any war tribunal or commission''', numerous unproven accusations of impropriety have been levelled at the division and at particular members of the division from a variety of sources. It is difficult to determine the extent of war criminality among members of the division.&quot;

Source clearly says:
 It is impossible to single out any one portion of the SS which was not involved in these criminal activities...
 Conclusions: The SS was utilised for the purposes which were criminal under the Charter involving the persecution and extermination of the Jews, brutalities and killings in concentration camps, excesses in the administration of occupied territories, the administration of the slave labour programme and the mistreatment and murder of prisoners of war...
 In dealing with the SS the Tribunal includes '''all persons who had been officially accepted as members of the SS''' including the members of the Allgemeine SS, members of the Waffen SS, members of the SS Totenkopf Verbaende and the '''members of any of the different police forces who were members of the SS'''&quot;

Exception was made only for the ones who were drafted, and the ones that left SS before 1939

:The statement &quot;&quot;Although the Galizien Division has '''not been found guilty of any war crimes by any war tribunal or commission''', numerous unproven accusations of impropriety have been levelled at the division and at particular members of the division from a variety of sources&quot; has a reliable source.  The statement you provided does not specifically indict the Galician division. It's a blanket statement.  That being said, there is no reason not to change the wording a little to &quot;has not been '''specifically''' found guilty of any war crimes by any war tribunal or commission.&quot;[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 14:10, 29 September 2016 (UTC)
::Galizien division was indicted in war crimes as a part of a bigger criminal organization, by Nuremberg Trial. Resolution of court is quite specific, and the exceptions were quoted above. Omitting or denying this fact is a breach of NPOV, and this should be reflected in the article. The sentence I proposed to remove, is not only confusing (and word &quot;specifically&quot; just adds confusion, then how ''not specifically'' it was found guilty? never explained) it's not exactly scientific saying &quot;by any war tribunal or commission&quot;, as the only commission mentioned is Deschênes Commission. At least two official points of view should be present, &quot;International Military Tribunal&quot; and &quot;Deschênes Commission&quot;, and if any other tribunals, trials or commissions are known, they should be listed too. As I said your source contradicts official documents of the trial if it claims that no tribunal or commission found Galizien SS guilty or someone misinterpreted the source. --[[Special:Contributions/73.202.90.135|73.202.90.135]] ([[User talk:73.202.90.135|talk]]) 08:47, 1 October 2016 (UTC)

==False picture in front of article==

Source is a book by [[Edward Prus]] - not reliable. Ukrainian tryzub wasn't used by Galicia Division in 1943 - all references to Ukraine were not officially allowed (thus, use of Galician lion as symbol, and the name was Galician rather than Ukrainian).  This picture is obviously either fake, or a picture of a unit that is not the Galician division.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 22:37, 21 November 2016 (UTC)

Image is described as one of the &quot;[[Ukrainian Liberation Army]]&quot; here: [http://www.wehrmacht-awards.com/forums/showthread.php?t=97822&amp;page=49].[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 22:40, 21 November 2016 (UTC)

* Your claim that the photograph might be a fake is of course preposterous. However, I'm inclined to believe that the description at source was erroneous. Therefore I'm moving the image to infobox of the [[Ukrainian Liberation Army]]. Although blogs are not reliable either, could you please explain the following caption, especially about the Battalion 118 mentioned there: Роман Крохмалюк у своїй праці “Заграва на Сході” (ст.12) пише: “До певної міри за українською ініціятивою (ОУН) створили німці окрему парамілітарну військову формацію УВВ. Члени цієї формації переходили вишкіл у Криниці, Команчі і Дуклі. Вони брали участь у боях на Східньому фронті на розлогих теренах України”. Ще є в живих учасник УВВ Теодор Ґуль із 118-го батальйону (сот. Шудра).

:: There is a history of people photoshopping swastikas onto Ukrainian images so the possibility of the image being fake is not &quot;preposterous&quot; though I am inclined to view it as an image of the wrong unit.  The quote translated is: &quot;to a certain extent under the initiative of the OUN the Germans created a separate paramilitary military formation UVV (Ukrainian Liberation Army).  Members of this formation underwent training in Krynycki, Komancza and Dukla.  They took part in battles on the eastern front on extensive Ukrainian territories.&quot;[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 16:32, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
