== Declaring my interest ==

Hi there. Anyone who's been following this article will know I've made a lot of changes to it. In the interests of transparency, I am a curator at the IWM. I have endeavoured to abide by [[WP:V]], [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:NOR]], and to stick to facts sourced from [[WP:RS]]. I have declared my interest also at [[WP:COIN]]. Any editor who thinks my edits are inappropriate is invited to discuss them here. Thanks for reading. [[User:IxK85|IxK85]] ([[User talk:IxK85|talk]]) 21:31, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

== Verification of sources == 

Going to add links to aid future verification. Most of the journal articles are accessible via [[JSTOR]], and extracts from [[The Times]] can be accessed through the Times Digital Archive at [http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/archive/]. Subscription is required for both services but many UK public libraries offer remote access.[[User:IxK85|IxK85]] ([[User talk:IxK85|talk]]) 12:42, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

{{Talk:Imperial War Museum/GA1}}

== Transport connections section ==

About the section recently added, I think the bus route information is probably more useful integrated into the infobox where there is already information on the train and underground connections. Also the night bus routes aren't really relevant; the museum is closed for the night before the first night buses pass. --[[User:IxK85|IxK85]] ([[User talk:IxK85|talk]]) 10:39, 23 December 2009 (UTC)

== Restructure - London building/Collections ==

Propose a minor change of structure, to incorporate most of the second paragraph of the Collections section into the London building section, as most of that Collections paragraph is discussing the layout and content of the building. --[[User:IxK85|IxK85]] ([[User talk:IxK85|talk]]) 12:25, 12 April 2010 (UTC)

== Governance ==

Propose to expand the 'Directors' section into a section on Governance, to include the museum's Board of Trustees and its composition.--[[User:IxK85|IxK85]] ([[User talk:IxK85|talk]]) 10:41, 13 April 2010 (UTC)

== Emphasis - history, branches, building/surroundings ==

Although this article already has Good Article status, there are a number of changes I'd like to make. For instance, the History section ought to at least mention the acquisition of each branch as a part of the museum's history; at present the article probably overemphasises the redevelopments of the Southwark building. The individual branch sections might benefit from being rewritten, as the branch articles have improved substantially since the main IWM article was last revised. Also, the paragraph on the park is not directly relevant to the museum, and perhaps might be better placed in the Building section (renamed to something like 'Imperial War Museum London: Building and surroundings'. Discussion always welcome. -[[User:IxK85|IxK85]] ([[User talk:IxK85|talk]]) 09:42, 15 April 2010 (UTC)
:Will go ahead and make the changes above in three edits. --[[User:IxK85|IxK85]] ([[User talk:IxK85|talk]]) 13:00, 16 April 2010 (UTC)

== Attendance figures ==

A recent edit has changed the visitor statistics from the official DCMS figures to newspaper figures, and has removed the total visits to all branches. Given that this page is about the IWM as a whole, and not just IWM London, I propose to revert to the previous stats and reference.--[[User:IxK85|IxK85]] ([[User talk:IxK85|talk]]) 08:44, 21 May 2010 (UTC)
:The source referenced has since changed, and as the figures appear reliable, I've readded the total visitor figure. Propose to alter the link to the ranking, however, to make clear that it refers to IWM London.--[[User:IxK85|IxK85]] ([[User talk:IxK85|talk]]) 17:23, 21 May 2010 (UTC)

== Title and scope of this article ==

This article is now rather outdated as it has the title ''Imperial War Museum'' and covers both the larger network and the main museum in Southwark. Although both had the same name until 2011, as the article itself notes the larger network has since been renamed ''Imperial War Museum'''s''''' and the main museum is now officially ''Imperial War Museum London''. Given that the other branches have their own articles there should really be one for IWM London and another for the larger network – cf. [[Tate Britain]] and [[Tate]], both of which were formerly called the Tate Gallery.

How should this be done? Retitle this page in the plural and create a new ''Imperial War Museum London'' article? Or vice versa – keep ''Imperial War Museum'' as the unofficial but familiar name for the main building and move the content on the organisation as a whole to a new article called ''Imperial War Museums''? I would be inclined to go for the former as that means the least change to the article, but it does raise the question of where ''Imperial War Museum'' would redirect. Any thoughts? [[User:Ham|Ham]] 14:46, 3 October 2013 (UTC)

::Move this to [[Imperial War Museum London]] and leave Imperial War Museum as a redirect to this article, hatnote on the top of this article eg &lt;nowiki&gt;{{for|the organisation|Imperial War Museums}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; But flag your thoughts up at the [[WP:Milhist]] project for more ideas and opinion. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 15:58, 3 October 2013 (UTC)
:::I'd be inclined to move this page to Imperial War Museums, and redirect Imperial War Museum to it. I don't think there's actually a need to create a separate 'IWM London' article. The other branches (HMS ''Belfast'', Cabinet War Rooms, IWM Duxford, IWM North) all have discrete starting points, their own dates of establishment and their own site histories. 'IWM London' by contrast, was, as a name, simply a renaming of a site that had been ''the'' Imperial War Museum since 1936, when other sites became IWM Duxford or IWM North. I think the article makes this sufficiently clear as it stands. [[User:IxK85|IxK85]] ([[User talk:IxK85|talk]]) 16:49, 3 October 2013 (UTC)

== Requested move 4 December 2015 ==

&lt;div class=&quot;boilerplate&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #efe; margin: 2em 0 0 0; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; border: 1px dotted #aaa;&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- Template:RM top --&gt;
:''The following is a closed discussion of a [[WP:requested moves|requested move]]. &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''Please do not modify it.'''&lt;/span&gt; Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on the talk page. Editors desiring to contest the closing decision should consider a [[Wikipedia:move review|move review]]. No further edits should be made to this section. ''

The result of the move request was: '''not moved'''. Chris's suggestion of a split seems worth following up on. [[User:Jenks24|Jenks24]] ([[User talk:Jenks24|talk]]) 15:42, 12 December 2015 (UTC)

[[:Imperial War Museum]] → {{no redirect|Imperial War Museums}} – The organisation has been named &quot;Imperial War Museums&quot; since 2011 and is referred to as such in the lead. However, the article is as much about IWM London as it is the wider organisation, so this is not necessarily straightforward (see discussion above from 2013). [[User:PC78|PC78]] ([[User talk:PC78|talk]]) 16:48, 4 December 2015 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. Still overwhelmingly known in the singular and used to refer only to the London museum. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 14:09, 9 December 2015 (UTC)
**Based on what...? [[User:PC78|PC78]] ([[User talk:PC78|talk]]) 16:08, 9 December 2015 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. The other four sites of the Imperial War Museums all have their own articles, whilst it seems that this article tries to cover both the organisation and the main London site. Perhaps the best solution would be to split the article, with a (probably fairly brief) ''[[Imperial War Museums]]'' article dealing with the organisation, and an ''[[Imperial War Museum London]]'' article covering the Southwark site. Unless that is done, then both the singular and plural names are valid, because they are the correct names for the two subjects of the article, and it comes down to which is the most useful. Which leads me to ... -- [[User:Chris j wood|chris_j_wood]] ([[User talk:Chris j wood|talk]]) 10:54, 10 December 2015 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. Whilst the article covers both the (singular) museum and the (plural) organisation, then I believe more WP readers are likely to be looking up the museum (which has hundreds of thousands of visitors a year) than the organisation running it (which is really only of interest to people in the museum business). I'd personally prefer to resolve this with an article split (see above) but in the absence of that, the current name should stay. -- [[User:Chris j wood|chris_j_wood]] ([[User talk:Chris j wood|talk]]) 11:07, 10 December 2015 (UTC)
