==Comments==
I would like opinions on adding a &quot;use in popular fiction/pop culture&quot; sub-section to this page to include the substance's apperance in the novel Generation-X by Douglas Coupland.

In the novel the character Dag, brings a mason jar full of trinitite as a gift for Claire and subsequently drops the jar causing it to break and spill after Claire's strong and apparently unexpected reaction once Dag explained what it was. If it is relevant to this addition, Couplands story is already well-documented and its contributions discussed in releated pages. The most enduring aspect of the novel is the title itself which popularized the phrase Generation X in America and Canada (though he acknowledges that it was orginally mentioned as a designation for a class system by a non-fiction writer whose name eludes me and was orginally used in the book in the reverse &quot;an x generation&quot;) as well as other neogoloisms such as 'McJob'.

I have not added this to the article as it is in my experience the only known example of trinitite being mentioned in novel and am unsure of adding a single sub-section for a single reference.

Personally, the substance fascinated me when I read about it in Generation X and until recenetly after doing a google search (which also took a fair bit of time due to my error of searching for it under the name 'trinite' instead of the correct 'trinitite') I was unsure if it was an example of artistic liscense or an actual substance formed at the above ground test site.

Trinitite is also featured prominently in &quot;The Green Glass Sea&quot; by [[Ellen Klages]]
ISBN 0670061344, in fact giving it its title.
An earlier short story of the same title can be found at
http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040906/greenglass-f.shtml

The [[Kharitonchik]] article contains very little that isn't contained here, and they are functionally the same thing. Merge and redirect seems like a good idea here. [[User:Kaini|Kaini]] ([[User talk:Kaini|talk]]) 23:48, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

Agreed. [[User:Danapit|Danapit]] ([[User talk:Danapit|talk]]) 13:35, 30 April 2011 (UTC)


I agree as well. [[User:Jax-Kenobi|Jax-Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Jax-Kenobi|talk]]) 18:08, 17 May 2011 (UTC)

== Isn't White Sands National Monument pretty much pure gypsum? ==

We've got some interesting conflicts of information running around the web right now. On one hand, we have very reputable sources working with the assumption that it was quartz sand (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that was fused into the glass, such as http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM33/AM33_360.pdf, and on the other hand we have very reputable sources saying that White Sands is 98% gypsum sand (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), such as http://www.nps.gov/whsa/learn/sand.htm . These are only two examples, the problem seems really widespread across the whole internet and I've found lots of sources supporting both sides. Is this a problem that we should/can fix? Or does someone have a simple explanation? My only current alternative hypothesis being that there's a small area of the White Sands Monument that for some reason is quartz sand, which seems unlikely.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Daemyth|Daemyth]] ([[User talk:Daemyth|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Daemyth|contribs]]) 00:53, 10 March 2016 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
