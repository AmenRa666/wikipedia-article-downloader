==Comments==
This article seems inconsistent with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_formation:

&quot;Some historians and authorities date the formation of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the eighth century BC in Sparta, though this is being revised as it is more likely that the formation was devised in the seventh century BC after the introduction of the Aspis shield (popularly but mistakenly known as the hoplon) by the city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible.&quot;

Aspis seems to be an alternate name for the clipeus. Both are the name of a Carthaginian city. Aspis was apparently the Carthaginian name for the place, while Clipeus was the Roman/Greek term for the location. In either case, the place gave its name to the shield. The shield itself seems to be a shoulder-to-knee (40&quot;) concave shield made of twisted wicker or layered wood, covered with 4-8 layers of ox-hide, and bound with a metal rim. Early versions used a balteus to carry them, but later replaced them with enarmes.

== This article contains no relevant content on the title. ==
Why is the entire article about the contextual meaning of the term '''hoplon''' when a) the title of the article is [[aspis]], and b) this is not Wiktionary? Yeah. --[[Special:Contributions/70.131.61.17|70.131.61.17]] ([[User talk:70.131.61.17|talk]]) 18:59, 14 March 2008 (UTC)

==MILHIST B-class checklist==
This article has a few issues that need to be addressed. First, as raised by the anon above, the definitions of hoplon need to go, as the anon astutely observed, this is not the Wiktionary, nor is it required to illustrate the point that aspis were/are commonly referred to as hoplons. Second, is sources; it appears that there's a source in the end of the main section, but this needs to be properly formatted as an in-line citation with the standard &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.

== Picture misleading ==

Surely there must be a better picture depicting an Aspis other than that painted on a pot. It's a bit misleading, at first glance one assumes the Aspis *is* the pot...  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.53.131.94|70.53.131.94]] ([[User talk:70.53.131.94|talk]]) 02:40, 27 October 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Aspis and hoplon ==

Hi, I noticed that you recently move the article &quot;aspis&quot; to &quot;hoplon&quot;, stating in the edit summary that the former is the more general term and that the latter is more specific.  I didn't see any discussion of this decision on the talk page, and am contacting you to suggest we take a closer look at this.  It appears from my own brief research that &quot;hoplon&quot; is a general term for any [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=opl&amp;lang=greek arms or weapon of war] (hence &quot;hoplite&quot;) but that &quot;aspis&quot; is specifically the Ancient Greek for the traditional heavy wooden round &quot;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=aspis&amp;lang=greek shield]&quot;, and is therefore the more specific term.  Certainly both terms are in common usage today to refer to the same item (the shield), but I wonder if &quot;aspis&quot; is not maybe the more appropriate namespace for the Wikipedia article on the subject.  Can you explain your decision to move it out of &quot;aspis&quot; and over to &quot;hoplon&quot; for me in greater detail?  Much appreciated.  Thanks! &lt;font face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;[[User:KDS4444|&lt;span style=&quot;color:midnightblue&quot;&gt;'''KDS'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:steelblue&quot;&gt;'''4444'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:KDS4444|&lt;span style=&quot;color:limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''Talk''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 17:14, 18 December 2014 (UTC)
:(Copied from my talk page) Thanks for contacting me. I moved the article because its content is all about the hoplites' shield, which according to the article is generally referred to as hoplon, not aspis. But as my knowledge in this area is next to zero, I'm ready to defer to any who have done their research. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Sandstein|&lt;font style=&quot;color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;Sandstein&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 17:58, 18 December 2014 (UTC)
::I did some more research, and have clarified that a move back to ''aspis'' is indeed the most appropriate thing to do.  Have added a new citation in the lead paragraph that explains this in what I hope is sufficient detail to make it clear for future editors: &quot;hoplon&quot; def. means &quot;gear of war&quot;; &quot;aspis&quot; actually means &quot;shield&quot;. &lt;font face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;[[User:KDS4444|&lt;span style=&quot;color:midnightblue&quot;&gt;'''KDS'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:steelblue&quot;&gt;'''4444'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:KDS4444|&lt;span style=&quot;color:limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''Talk''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 08:12, 19 December 2014 (UTC)</text>
