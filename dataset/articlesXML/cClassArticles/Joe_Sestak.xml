'''Joseph Ambrose &quot;Joe&quot; Sestak, Jr.''' (born December 12, 1951) is an American politician and retired [[United States Department of the Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Two-star rank|two-star admiral]]. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he represented {{ushr|PA|7}} in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 2007 to 2011 and was the Democratic nominee for the [[United States Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2010|2010]], losing to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Pat Toomey]]. He was and remains the highest-ranking military official ever elected to the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Sestak-t.html?pagewanted=all|title=Joe Sestak, the 60th Democrat |publisher=NYTimes |date=2010-08-18 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduating near the top of his class at the [[United States Naval Academy]], Sestak served in the [[United States Navy]] for over 30 years and rose to the rank of three-star admiral. He served as the Director for Defense on the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] staff under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] and held a series of operational commands, including commanding the [[USS George Washington (CVN-73)|USS ''George Washington'']] carrier strike group during combat operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] and Indian Ocean in 2002.

Sestak was elected to the House of Representatives in 2006 and reelected in 2008. He declined to run for reelection in 2010, instead running for the Senate. In [[United States Senate Democratic primary election in Pennsylvania, 2010|the Democratic primary]] he defeated incumbent Senator [[Arlen Specter]] (who had recently switched from the Republican Party), 54 percent to 46 percent. In [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2010|the general election]], he was defeated by Republican nominee [[Pat Toomey]], 51 percent to 49 percent, a margin of 80,229 votes out of almost four million cast. Sestak sought a rematch with Toomey in the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2016|2016 election]] but lost the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2016#Democratic primary|Democratic primary]] to [[Katie McGinty]].

==Early life, education and early career==
Sestak was born in [[Secane, Pennsylvania]], the son of Kathleen L. and Joseph Sestak, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delconewsnetwork.com/articles/2009/09/22/obituaries/doc4ab283192d5dc799232498.txt?viewmode=fullstory&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Martin, came to America from the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] village of [[Dolné Lovčice]] in 1922, after World War I, while his father was sent to America in 1924 to join Martin. Sestak's father graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1942, and then fought in both the Atlantic and the Pacific during [[World War II]], rising to the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;philly&quot;&gt;Fitzgerald, Thomas. [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20100411_Sestak_s_tough_fight_for_Senate_seat.html?viewAll=y Sestak's tough fight for Senate seat.] ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]].'' 11 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his service after the war as an engineering officer at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biography1&quot;&gt;[http://www.biography.com/articles/Joseph-Sestak-587188 Joe Sestak Biography]{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sestak attended [[Cardinal O'Hara High School]] in [[Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Springfield, Pennsylvania]], where his mother worked as a math teacher.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Sestak was deeply inspired by his father. He has recalled the time Joseph Sr. spent five hours fixing the family car in the freezing cold of a Philadelphia winter: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I remember going to the window and watching him. And the admiration that I had—just that strong determination of his. Never give in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Joseph-Sestak-587188 |title=Joseph Sestak Biography |publisher=Biography.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Following in his father's footsteps, Sestak was accepted into the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] immediately after graduating from high school, during the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1974, Sestak graduated second in his class of over 900 midshipmen, with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in American political systems.&lt;ref name=navy&gt;VADM Joseph Sestak, USN Ret., Officer Bio File, United States Navy Operational Archives, [[U.S. Naval Historical Center]], Washington Navy Yard, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Between tours at sea, Sestak earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] and a [[Doctor of philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[political economy]] and government from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1980 and 1984, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Malloy, Daniel. [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10095/1047964-178.stm Sestak refuses to back down in race for Specter's seat.] ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.'' 5 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval career==
[[File:US Navy 070902-N-1810F-324 Guided-missile frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG 58) patrols the waters off the coast of Panama during PANAMAX 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Sestak commanded the [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS Samuel B. Roberts]] to victory in the [[Battenberg Cup]].]]
As a [[surface warfare]] officer, Sestak served division officer tours as damage control assistant, combat information center officer and weapons officer on the [[guided missile destroyer]] [[USS Richard E. Byrd (DDG-23)|USS ''Richard E. Byrd'']], and later as weapons officer on the guided missile destroyer [[USS Hoel (DDG-13)|USS ''Hoel'']]. He then served as aide and flag lieutenant to the admiral in charge of United States Navy surface forces in the Pacific.

In January 1986, Sestak became executive officer of the guided missile frigate [[USS Underwood (FFG-36)|USS ''Underwood'']] and was instrumental in the Underwood's winning the coveted [[Battle Efficiency Award|battle E]] and the [[Battenberg Cup]] (awarded to the best ship in the Atlantic fleet). He then served in the Politico-Military Assessment Division of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. On August 30, 1991, Sestak took command of the guided missile frigate [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts'']], which was named the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]]'s best [[surface combatant]] in the 1993 [[Battenberg Cup]] competition.

In July 1993, Sestak became the head of the Strategy and Concepts Branch in the office of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. From November 1994 to March 1997, he was the Director for Defense Policy on the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] staff at the [[White House]], where he was responsible for national security and defense strategy, policies, programs, inter-agency and congressional coordination and regional political-military advice. In May 1997, he became the commander of Destroyer Squadron 14.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;

Sestak then directed the CNO's Strategy and Policy Division (N51), and led the navy's efforts toward the 2000 Quadrennial Defense Review, for which he analyzed the economic value of U.S. defense spending. After [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th]], he became the first director of the Navy Operations Group (Deep Blue), which sought to redefine strategic, operational and budgetary policies in the Global [[War on Terrorism]]. He reported directly to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO), [[Admiral]] [[Vern Clark]], as policy adviser and administrator. Under Clark, Sestak worked to rein in military spending by maximizing fleet efficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;philly&quot;/&gt;

===Controversy over reassignment===
[[File:VADM Joseph A. Sestak, Jr.jpg|thumb|right|Sestak as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs.]]
In the summer of 2005, Sestak was administratively removed from his position as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs (N6/N7), the three-star position in which he had served since 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;removal&quot;&gt;Jacobson, Louis. [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/06/09/sestak_damn_the_torpedoes_full_speed_ahead_96907.html Sestak: Damn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead.] ''Real Clear Politics.'' 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His removal was one of the first changes made by [[Admiral]] [[Michael Mullen]] when he took over as the new [[Chief of Naval Operations]] in July 2005, according to ''[[Navy Times]]''.

Sestak was reassigned as a special assistant to the [[Vice Chief of Naval Operations]], and then opted to retire when his three-year-old daughter was diagnosed with malignant brain cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/bio.asp?bioID=257 |title=Official U.S. Navy bio |publisher=Navy.mil |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy ensued over his departure: it was reported that he was pushed out because he &quot;ruffled feathers&quot; within the Bush Administration and came into conflict with [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] over Sestak's advocacy for spending cuts.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography1&quot; /&gt; In an investigative report by ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Chief of Naval Operations [[Vern Clark]] stated that he&lt;blockquote&gt;
''&quot;wanted straight talk, and this put [Sestak] in the crosshairs. People are going to say what they want to say, but he challenged people who did not want to be challenged. The guy is courageous, a patriot’s patriot.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pa2012.com/2010/04/veterans-tell-specter-to-take-down-ad-against-sestak/ |title=Veterans tell Specter to take down ad against Sestak (VIDEO REPORT) |publisher=Pa2012.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After Sestak retired from the Navy, his daughter made a recovery. He retired as a [[Rear admiral (upper half)|two-star admiral]], not having held the rank of [[Vice admiral (United States)|three-star admiral]] long enough to retain it in retirement.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography1&quot;/&gt;

===Military decorations===
Sestak's decorations include the [[Defense Distinguished Service Medal]], [[Defense Superior Service Medal]], two [[Legion of Merit]] awards, two [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medals]], [[Joint Service Commendation Medal]], three [[Navy Commendation Medal]]s and the [[Navy Achievement Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndu.edu/inss/symposia/jointops00/sestak.html |title=Vice Admiral Joseph A.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===2006 election===
[[File:Joe Sestak and Chris Dodd at children's issues event.jpg|thumb|left|Sestak and Senator [[Chris Dodd]] at a children's issues talk in August 2006]]
{{Main article|Pennsylvania 7th congressional district election, 2006}}
Sestak was the second Democrat to win in Pennsylvania's traditionally [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]] since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The race was in the national spotlight, as it was profiled in [[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]] as the harbinger of the national political climate of the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 elections]] and the most-watched [[Electoral district#Swing seats and safe seats|swing district]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klein |first=Joe |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1535816,00.html |title=In Pennsylvania, it's the Admiral Vs. the Firefighter |publisher=TIME |date=2006-09-17 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, with his daughter's recovery going smoothly, Sestak was motivated to run for Congress by the benefits he received under the [[United States Military]]'s [[TRICARE]] health care program, which gave his daughter the care she needed to treat her brain tumor. Sestak stated that, during his travels to find the best treatment for his daughter, he saw children who didn't have the same quality of care, or couldn't afford the necessary care. Sestak made health-care reform a pillar of his campaign in hopes of giving everyone the same care his family had. He called his congressional service a continuation of his military service, &quot;paying back&quot; the country that took care of his daughter.

Sestak began laying the groundwork for a Congressional run in his home district in Pennsylvania as a Democrat. He was then told he had to first receive the endorsement of the &quot;DCCC.&quot; Sestak first thought this meant his hometown's [[Delaware County Community College]], but he was eventually steered toward the correct DCCC, the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]], and informed its head, [[Rahm Emanuel]], of his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/297056-6 Source: C-SPAN, Dec 13, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel told Sestak he was not ready for the election. Pennsylvania's 7th district is heavily conservative, Republicans outnumbering Democrats 2:1. Sestak decided to run anyway and turned to his brother, Richard, and sisters, Elizabeth and Margaret, who served as his campaign manager, top fundraiser and treasurer, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Murray |first1=Shailagh |last2=Kane |first2=Paul |title=Outsider candidates for Congress seek insider help in general election |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 13, 2010 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/12/AR2010061203926_2.html |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sestak challenged ten-term Republican incumbent [[Curt Weldon]] in the race, and proved a capable fundraiser. In the second quarter of 2006, he raised $704,000 to Weldon's $692,000; in the third, $1.14 million to $912,000. As of September 30, 2006, Sestak had $1.53 million cash on hand, while Weldon had $1.12 million in the bank after making a $500,000 TV ad buy that had not started as of the close of the third quarter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delcotimes.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=17280041&amp;BRD=1675&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=18171&amp;rfi=8 Source: Delaware County Daily Times, Oct 4, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313030526/http://www.delcotimes.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=17280041&amp;BRD=1675&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=18171&amp;rfi=8 |date=March 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sestak received campaign donations from people around the world, including performer [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[John Grisham]], [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], and many Naval officers.

A poll released in late September 2006 showed Sestak and Weldon locked in a statistical dead heat. Sestak led Weldon 44-43 among likely voters in a [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]] [[Keystone Poll]] released September 29. The poll also found that 49 percent of registered voters in the district felt it was time for change in the district and only 37 percent said Weldon deserved reelection.&lt;ref&gt;Bender, William. Sestak’s coffers continue to grow. ''Delaware County Daily Times.'' 4 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers suggested Sestak had seriously eroded Weldon's previous lead; a poll conducted in April 2006 by the pro-Democratic Party organization Democracy Corps had Weldon leading 51 percent to 41 percent. On October 6, the nonpartisan [[Cook Political Report]] moved the race from &quot;Lean Republican&quot; to &quot;Toss Up.&quot; An October 8–10 survey by nonpartisan pollster Constituent Dynamics put Sestak ahead 51–44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majoritywatch.com/ |title=Majority Watch |publisher=Majority Watch |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 13, CQPolitics moved the race from &quot;Leans Republican&quot; to &quot;No Clear Favorite.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, Greg.

===2008 election===
{{See also|Pennsylvania 7th congressional district election, 2008}}
[[Image:Joe Sestak 2008.jpg|thumb|195 px|right|Sestak at a campaign event in October 2008]]
In 2008, Sestak faced Republican nominee [[Wendell Craig Williams]], a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] and attorney. Sestak defeated him by a 20-point margin (59.6 percent to 40.4 percent), a full 8 points more than his 2006 margin, considered by many a [[landslide victory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=13&amp;ElectionID=28&amp;OfficeID=11#7 |title=Sestak V.

Sestak became the second Democrat in the district's history to be reelected.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Legislation and key votes===
Sestak wrote various pieces of bipartisan legislation that successfully passed Congress. In 2008, the ''[[National Journal]]'' identified him as &quot;at the ideological center of the House.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nj.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/pdf/08centrists.pdf The Centrists] ''National Journal.'' 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Steny Hoyer]] named Sestak the most productive freshman member of Congress in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Alex. [http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2007/12/26/past%20stories/19995642.txt Democrat leader: Sestak was most productive freshman in U.S. House.] ''Daily Times.'' 26 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[111th United States Congress]], Sestak's last term in office, Congress passed more bills written by Sestak than bills written by both of Pennsylvania's senators combined.

Most significantly, Sestak created the House Pediatric Cancer Caucus, which he co-chaired; extended benefits for those seeking work ([[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]]) as a part of the JOBS bill; co-wrote the amendment to give small businesses tax credits, as a part of [[Affordable Health Care for America Act|health care reform]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joesestak.com/issues |title=Web Page Under Construction |publisher=Joesestak.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved the first significant federals funds into [[autism]] care and research, nicknamed the &quot;Sestak Amendment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Web Page Under Construction&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joesestak.com/aboutjoe |title=Web Page Under Construction |publisher=Joesestak.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Congress's senior veteran, he was an original cosponsor of the repeal of [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]] as well as the repeal of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]. Sestak also heavily advocated ending bailouts to banks in the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Wall Street Reform]] Bill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web Page Under Construction&quot;/&gt; Sestak voted for the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], but lamented that it did not provide enough accountability measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll046.xml FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 46.] ''House.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; He also voted for the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll037.xml FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 37.] ''House.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll477.xml FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 477.] ''House.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll887.xml FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 887.] ''House.gov''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his legislation that generated attention but eventually failed included researching potential adoption and expansion of [[thorium-based nuclear power]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://itheo.org/articles/congressman-calls-thorium-energy Congressman Calls for Thorium Energy.] ''International Thorium Energy Organisation''&lt;/ref&gt; and the first legislation to restrict the effects of ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepennsylvaniaprogressive.com/diary/2161/sestak-seeks-to-undo-citizens-united-decision Sestak Seeks to Undo Citizens United Decision.] ''The Pennsylvania Progressive''{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media===
In 2007, Sestak's campaign was the first federal campaign to create a [[Facebook]] Fan Page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The few, the proud, the tweet-less |url=https://www.politicopro.com/go/?id=21636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sestak joined [[Twitter]] shortly before he was sworn in for his second term. His congressional account made him the first congressperson on Twitter to use it for an official basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tweet Grader: joesestak1 |url=http://tweet.grader.com/go/tweetingsince/user/Joesestak1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving office, his social networks were merged with his personal accounts, which have been [[Twitter#Verified accounts|verified]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/joesestak |title=Community Page about Joe Sestak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Twitter]]|url=https://twitter.com/joesestak |title=Joe Sestak (@JoeSestak)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sestak is said to have been a prime example of the ''[[Colbert Bump]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Representative Sestak Hopes For Another Colbert Bump|url=http://lezgetreal.com/2009/08/representative-sestak-hopes-for-another-colbert-bump/|publisher=Lez Get Real}}&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing on &quot;[[The Colbert Report]]&quot; in 2008, Sestak spoke of the positive impact of social media and viral video clips of the appearance. He appeared on the show even after Democratic leaders [[Rahm Emanuel]] and [[Nancy Pelosi]] instructed Democrats not to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emanuel to new Democratic members of Congress: Avoid Colbert|url=http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Emanuel_to_new_Dem_members_of_0315.html|publisher=Raw Story}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his first appearance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Know A District - Pennsylvania's 7th - Joe Sestak|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/166773/april-22-2008/better-know-a-district---pennsylvania-s-7th---joe-sestak|publisher=Colbert Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sestak won his election in a landslide in a Republican majority district, and after appearing again in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Sestak|url=http://colbertnation.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/colbert_report/videos/season5/05106/cr_05106_02_v6.jpg?width=133&amp;height=71&amp;quality=0.91&amp;crop=true|publisher=Colbert Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a part of his announcement to run against incumbent Senator [[Arlen Specter]] in the 2010 Democratic primary, Sestak won by a surprising eight points. Sestak did not appear on the show during the 2010 general election, which he narrowly lost. The day after the loss, host [[Stephen Colbert]] lamented the loss and called Sestak a &quot;friend&quot; on air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Hardly Knew Ye|url=http://colbertnation.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/colbert_report/videos/season6/06140/cr_06140_02_16x9.jpg?width=133&amp;height=71&amp;quality=0.91&amp;crop=true|publisher=Colbert Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional staff===
Sestak and his staff were recognized for their successful tenure and he was voted &quot;The Most Productive Member of Congress.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailycollegian&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_862abb1b-32d1-5f6c-95b9-98e22d9921a6.html?mode=jqm |title=Sestak to meet with students |publisher=The Daily Collegian |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2014-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sestak expressed pride in the constituent services his office provided, handling over 10,000 cases since he was elected. &quot;Every person who has worked for me has been tremendous,&quot; he said. His staff serviced four times the constituent cases than that of the average Congressional office, while hosting an average of 15 large summit gatherings in his district each year on key issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;realclearpolitics1&quot;/&gt;

Some critics were quick to cite Sestak's handling of his Congressional staff as evidence to solidify &quot;the perception that he is a taskmaster with a prickly streak.&quot; During his first term in office, Sestak employed 61 people as staff in his official congressional office, while comparable representatives employed a total of 28, 26, and 25 staff members, indicating that Sestak had a high turnover rate. A former aide added that Sestak's staff turnover was not as much of a drawback as one might expect. &quot;Other Members rely on their staff to keep themselves informed, but with him, it's top-down,&quot; the former aide said. &quot;He knows what he wants to accomplish, so in a sense, he just needs people to dictate to.&quot; Sestak acknowledged that his aides spend long hours on duty and that the work is &quot;pretty demanding.&quot; He added that the staff was becoming stabler over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;realclearpolitics1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/06/09/sestak_damn_the_torpedoes_full_speed_ahead_96907.html |title=Sestak: Damn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead? |publisher=Real Clear Politics |date=2009-06-09 |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 presidential election===
Sestak endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] for president in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primaries]] and served as her campaign national security adviser, specializing in veterans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/documents/the-war-over-the-wonks.html&lt;/ref&gt; He told [[Stephen Colbert]] on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' that he trusted her leadership after serving with her in the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Know a District - Pennsylvania's 7th - Joe Sestak|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/166773/april-22-2008/better-know-a-district---pennsylvania-s-7th---joe-sestak}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being Clinton's foreign policy adviser, Sestak served as her superdelegate and a was a surrogate throughout the primary, appearing in several rallies and TV appearances for her, including an ad emphasizing Clinton's foreign policy strengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=War Over The Wonks|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/documents/the-war-over-the-wonks.html|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sestak endorsed [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|general election]] after Obama received the Democratic nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sestakforcongress.com/latest-news/715 |title=Congressman Joe Sestak's (PA-07) Endorsement of Senator Barack Obama for President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces |publisher=Sestakforcongress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 U.S. Senate election==

===Primary election===
{{Main article|United States Senate Democratic primary election in Pennsylvania, 2010}}
[[Image:Joe Sestak 2009.jpg|thumb|230 px|right|Sestak speaking at an &quot;[[Employee Free Choice Act]] Rally&quot; at the Pennsylvania State Democratic Convention in Pittsburgh in June 2009.]]
Whispers of a possible [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] campaign appeared in 2008 after his [[landslide victory]] and $3 million campaign surplus after his reelection. Even before [[Arlen Specter]]'s announcement to switch parties, draft efforts were organized. However, once Specter switched, nationwide support mounted for a possible senatorial campaign. Most prominent was a straw poll conducted by the [[Progressive Change Campaign Committee]] titled &quot;Should a Draft Sestak movement be created to take on Sen. Arlen Specter in the Pennsylvania Democratic primary?&quot; Nationwide, almost 8000 votes were cast with 86 percent responding yes, including 85 percent of Pennsylvanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boldprogressives.org/sestakpollresults.html |title=Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC) |publisher=Boldprogressives.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731175057/http://boldprogressives.org/sestakpollresults.html |archivedate=July 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sestak faced significant opposition to his candidacy from President [[Barack Obama|Obama]], the national [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the state party. Then-Pennsylvania Governor [[Ed Rendell]] appeared on national television and said, &quot;Joe Sestak should not run for the Senate in the Democratic primary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31046903/ns/msnbc_tv-the_ed_show/ 'The Ed Show' for Friday, May 29.] ''[[MSNBC]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Sestak responded, &quot;there’s no more kings, there’s no more kingmakers in America,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pa2012.com/2010/06/sestak-still-hitting-party-leaders |title=Sestak still hitting party leaders |publisher=pa2012.com |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeded to visit all 67 counties of Pennsylvania.

On May 27, 2009, Sestak indicated that he intended to challenge Specter in the [[United States Senate Democratic primary election in Pennsylvania, 2010|2010 Democratic primary]] (pending a final family decision because he hadn't &quot;had the time to sit down with my eight-year-old daughter or my wife to make sure that we are all ready to get in&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/05/27/sestak-i-intend-to-get-in-this-race/ |title=Sestak: 'I intend to get in this race' |publisher=Politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate= 2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, he was overheard saying &quot;[i]t would take an act of God for me to not get in now&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hirschhorn| first =Dan| authorlink = Dan Hirschhorn|url=http://www.pa2010.com/2009/06/sestak-only-an-act-of-god-will-keep-him-out-of-senate-race/ |title=Sestak: Only an 'act of God' will keep him out of Senate race |publisher=pa2010.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll conducted May 20–26, Specter led the Democratic primary with 50 percent, with Sestak at 21 percent and 27 percent undecided. Despite the gap, it was noted that Sestak did not have much statewide recognition at the time, as he represented only one of Pennsylvania's 19 congressional districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = SPECTER TOPS TOOMEY BY 9 PTS.

On August 4, Sestak officially announced his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joesestak.com/welcome/Home/Home.html |title=Home |publisher=JoeSestak.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, Richard, was his campaign manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pa2010.com/2009/04/exclusive-sestak-seen-as-most-likely-to-run-against-specter-in-primary/ |title=Sestak seen as most likely to run against Specter in primary |accessdate=2010-02-19 |date= 2009-04-29 |work=pa2010.com web site |publisher=Sam Rohrer |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pa2010.com%2F2009%2F04%2Fexclusive-sestak-seen-as-most-likely-to-run-against-specter-in-primary%2F&amp;date=2010-02-18 |archivedate=2010-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing Specter's switch from the Republican to the Democratic Party, Sestak has said that the switch was &quot;100 percent&quot; motivated by politics.&lt;ref name= &quot;midweekpolitics.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.midweekpolitics.com/2010/03/17/march-17-2010/ March 17, 2010.] [[Midweek Politics with David Pakman]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At a little after 10 p.m., on May 18, 2010, the Associated Press called the primary for Sestak.&lt;ref name=&quot;admiral&quot;&gt;Toeplitz, Shira. [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0510/37464.html The admiral sinks Arlen Specter.] ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]].'' 18 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Democratic opposition====
Throughout the [[primary election]], the Obama administration and the Democratic Party campaigned heavily against Sestak, as the [[Barack Obama|President]], [[Joe Biden|Vice President]], and numerous [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet members]] and Senators hosted many fundraisers and events for Specter. On September 19, 2009, [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] even shut down the entire [[United States Senate]], as he, the President, and many Senators instead flew to Philadelphia to host a prominent fundraiser for Specter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/16/specter-fundraisers-stall-senate-voting/?feat=home_headlines |title=Specter fundraiser stalls Senate voting |publisher=Washington Times |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event drew controversy for closing federal business and because the money raised during the event would be given to Republicans and conservative [[Political action committee|PACs]] that asked for refunds of contributions given before Specter's party switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MinistryOfTruth |url=http://www.progressiveelectorate.com/diary/1655/specter-uses-dem-donations-to-refund-gop-donors |title=Specter uses Dem donations to refund GOP donors |publisher=The Progressive Electorate |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama's presidential campaign, called &quot;Organizing for America&quot; during the off years, also led efforts against Sestak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/05/president-obamas-campaign-arm-tries-to-get-grassroots-democrats-to-defeat-fellow-progressive.html |title=President Obama’s Campaign Arm Tries to Get Grass-Roots Democrats to Defeat Fellow Progressive&amp;nbsp;— Political Punch |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Job offer to Sestak====
In a February 2010 interview, Sestak responded affirmatively when asked if the Obama administration had offered him a high-level White House job if he would end his candidacy for the Senate. Sestak stated that he had quickly refused the offer.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Thomas. [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/84835732.html Sestak holds to story of job offer.] ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]].'' 20 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to give the specifics of the offer on [[Midweek Politics with David Pakman]], he refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;midweekpolitics.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3knuAaz4xE |title=Midweek Politics with David Pakman&amp;nbsp;– Interview With Congressman Joe Sestak Part 1 of 2 |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmZUt8efiZA |title=Midweek Politics with David Pakman&amp;nbsp;– Interview With Congressman Joe Sestak Part 2 of 2 |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to offer no further details until the Obama administration released [[White House Counsel]] Robert F.

After the report's release, Sestak issued a statement essentially confirming it.&lt;ref name=&quot;sestakstatement&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/05/28/raw-data-sestaks-statement-white-house-report-job-offer/|date=May 28, 2010|accessdate=May 28, 2010|publisher=FOX News|title=RAW DATA: Sestak's Statement on White House Report on Job Offer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican Congressman [[Darrell Issa]] alleged that such an offer and Sestak's failure to report it could be felonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6514669n |title=Who Offered Sestak a WH Job?&amp;nbsp;– CBS News Video |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date= |accessdate= 2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partisan legal analysts have disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalethicsforum.com/blog/2010/05/joe-sestaks-bribe-scandal-another-ethics-sideshow.html |title=Joe Sestak’s &quot;Bribe&quot; Scandal: Another Ethics Sideshow |publisher=Legal Ethics Forum |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General election===
{{main article|United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2010}}
Many cited the Pennsylvania Senate general election as the &quot;marquee race of 2010,&quot; a bellwether of the national stage. After securing the Democratic Party's nomination, calling it &quot;a win for the people, over the establishment, over the status quo, even over Washington, DC,&quot; Sestak enjoyed a slight lead in the polls against the Republican Party's candidate, former Congressman and [[Club for Growth]] President [[Pat Toomey]]. But while Sestak tried to recoup his financial losses after a long primary, Toomey had not faced a competitive primary and aired TV ads much earlier than Sestak. Toomey's effective fundraising and advertising allowed him to rise in the polls, at one point gaining a double-digit lead, causing political pundits to move the race from &quot;Toss Up&quot; to &quot;Lean Republican.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/senate/pennsylvania-senate-race-moves.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Chris | last= Cilizza | title=Pennsylvania Senate race moves to &quot;Lean Republican&quot; | date=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many stopped short of calling the race &quot;Solid Republican&quot; as Sestak had a reputation for campaigning until he &quot;sees the whites of their eyes&quot; and 11th-hour comebacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/senate/pa/pennsylvania_senate_sestak_vs_toomey-1059.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Sestak began airing ads in mid-fall and overcame his deficit in opinion polls, closing to within the margin of error. At the beginning of election night, Sestak led in the exit polls by a large margin, but as more votes were counted and central Pennsylvania's &quot;red T&quot; area began reporting, Toomey caught up. Counting continued until early morning, as the numbers were too close for a winner to be declared. As the percentages stabilized, it became clear Toomey was the winner. Sestak conceded the race to a ballroom full of his supporters at the [[Radnor Hotel]]. He lost by 80,000 votes out of four million cast, a margin large enough to avoid a recount. It was the smallest losing margin of any Pennsylvania Democratic candidate in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/02/AR2010110208465.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Marc | last=Levy | title=Pa.

The total spent on the race was $20 million, the most of any federal election in 2010. After [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]] was decided, conservative [[Political action committees|Political Action Committees]] and corporations broke the record for outside spending, airing ads on Toomey's behalf and causing Sestak to be outspent 3 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politicspa.com/corbett-and-toomey-had-twice-as-many-ads-as-onorato-and-sestak-en-route-to-victory/20147/ | work=PoliticsPA | first=Tom | last= Mulkeen | title=Corbett and Toomey had twice as many ads as Onorato and Sestak | date=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sestak responded to this outside spending at Philadelphia Constitution Hall, arguing, &quot;It is we, the people. Not we, the corporations, nor we, Wall Street.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.issues2000.org/Archive/2010_PA_Senate_Joe_Sestak.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 U.S. Senate election==
{{Main article|United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2016}}
After his defeat, Sestak served as a Distinguished Practice Professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon University's]] [[Heinz College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Faculty Details&quot;&gt;[http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/faculty-details/index.aspx?faculty_id=474]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013 he was named the 2013-14 recipient of the General Omar N.

The same month, Sestak launched an exploratory committee for a rematch with Toomey. He did not officially declare his candidacy as that would contravene the rules of his new appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicspa.com/breaking-sestak-for-senate-with-video/48009/ |title=Breaking: Sestak for Senate (With Video) |publisher=PoliticsPA |date=May 14, 2013 |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, as he campaigned with [[Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 gubernatorial]] nominee [[Tom Wolf (politician)|Tom Wolf]], he said that he would make an official announcement soon.&lt;ref name=soon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/capitol-ideas/mc-joe-sestak-to-launch-official-senate-bid-soon-20140904-story.html |title=Sestak gearing up for official bid against Toomey |publisher=The Morning Call |date=September 4, 2014 |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, he sent out an email confirming that he would run and officially launched his campaign in March 2015 by walking 422 miles across Pennsylvania from the New Jersey to the Ohio borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicspa.com/pa-sen-sestak-prepares-for-battle/61699/ |title=PA-Sen: Sestak Prepares for Battle |publisher=PoliticsPA |date=November 6, 2014 |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beck|first1=Tom|title=PA-Sen: Sestak Kicks Off 2016 Campaign in Philadelphia|url=http://www.politicspa.com/pa-sen-sestak-kicks-off-2016-campaign-in-philadelphia/64238/|accessdate=March 5, 2015|agency=PoliticsPA|date=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare===
Sestak credits his support for health care reform as &quot;payback&quot; to the country that gave him and his family health care while he was in the Navy (the [[TRICARE]] program), especially for successfully treating his daughter's brain tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todaysworkplace.org/tag/rep-joe-sestak/ |title=Today’s Workplace » Rep. Joe Sestak |publisher=Todaysworkplace.org |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports state-provided preventive care and voted for the [[CHAMP Act]].

===Unions===
Sestak is an original cosponsor of the [[Employee Free Choice Act]] and supports the original version that includes [[card check]]. He created the Labor Advisory Committee to address the challenges facing working families in his district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joesestak.com/Health.html Health.] ''Joe Sestak: Democrat for Senate.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical marijuana===
Sestak voted to allow states to regulate [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] by voting for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008, which would have barred the Department of Justice from preventing the implementation of state laws regarding the distribution, possession, and cultivation of medical marijuana. The bill was defeated 165–262.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=14547&amp;can_id=58333 State and Federal Medical Marijuana Law Enforcement and Implementation.] ''[[Project Vote Smart]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
As a candidate, Sestak campaigned to end [[Iraq War|the war in Iraq]]. Once in office in 2007, he supported Congressional efforts to redeploy forces but also voted for the war supplemental the House constructed after President Bush's veto, a bill many critics of the Bush administration called a &quot;blank check&quot; for the continuation of administration policies in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://youngphillypolitics.com/joe_sestak_and_allyson_schwartz_vote_continue_war_unabated Joe Sestak and Allyson Schwartz Vote to Continue the War Unabated.] ''Young Philly Politics.'' 22 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Sestak and other veterans argued that they should not punish soldiers for the President's actions, and supported the bill in order to give the armed forces adequate protection and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicspa.com/congressman-sestak-votes-for-passage-of-war-supplemental-appropriations-measure-also-contains-vital-funding-for-gulf-relief-education-veterans-border-control/13099/ Congressman Sestak Votes for Passage of War Supplemental: Appropriations measure also contains vital funding for Gulf relief, education, veterans, border control.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sestak supported the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act of 2008]], which critics contended continued the Bush administration's policy of [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless wiretapping]] and provided retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies who participated in the [[National Security Agency|National Security Agency's]] &quot;[[terrorist surveillance program]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll437.xml Roll Call Vote for HR 6304, FISA Amendments Act.] ''House.gov''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sestak supported the deployment of additional troops to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] in late 2009, and military actions such as [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|drone strikes in northwest Pakistan]]. He supports the gradual drawdown of troops from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sestak.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:defense&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=34 Defense.] ''Congressman Joe Sestak.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sestak was an opponent of &quot;[[don't ask, don't tell]]&quot;, the policy that excludes gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the military, saying that the policy means &quot;[w]e're absolutely not adhering to the ideals of our nation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Kornreich | first = Lauren | title = Sestak: 'Rogue unit' abused gay sailor | publisher = CNN | date = 2009-10-12 | url = http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/10/12/sestak-rogue-unit-abused-gay-sailor/ | accessdate = 2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sestak was instrumental in bringing to light a [[United States Navy dog handler hazing scandal|two-year pattern of abuse]], including anti-gay hazing, that took place within a [[Military Working Dog]] unit stationed in [[Bahrain]], sparking an investigation that turned up nearly 100 instances of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Witte| first = Brian | title = Petty Officer forced to retire early | agency = Associated Press | date = 2009-10-21 | url = http://www.woodtv.com/dpp/military/military_ap_annapolis_Petty_Officer_to_face_punishment_200910211256153614514 | accessdate = 2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
