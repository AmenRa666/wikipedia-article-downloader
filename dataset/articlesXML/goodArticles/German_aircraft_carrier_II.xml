The [[aircraft carrier]] '''II''' was a proposed conversion project for the incomplete French cruiser [[French cruiser De Grasse|''De Grasse'']]. The ship was laid down in November 1938 and lay incomplete in the [[Arsenal de Lorient]] shipyard when Germany [[Battle of France|invaded France in May 1940]]. In 1942, [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' decided to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary aircraft carrier with a capacity for twenty-three [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s and [[dive bomber]]s. Work ceased in February 1943, however, due to concerns with the ship's design, a severe shortage of material and labor, and the threat of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing raids. The ship was eventually completed as an anti-aircraft cruiser in 1956 by the [[French Navy]].

==Design==
The French cruiser [[French cruiser De Grasse|''De Grasse'']] was laid down at the [[Arsenal de Lorient]] shipyard in [[Lorient]] in November 1938. Work on the unfinished ship stopped following the German [[Battle of France|conquest of France]] in May 1940.&lt;ref name=GC266&gt;Gardiner &amp; Chesneau, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' considered several proposals to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary [[aircraft carrier]]. The final proposal was completed by August 1942, but work on the conversion did not last long. By February 1943, the project had been abandoned, for several reasons. The shipyard suffered from a shortage of labor and materials, and the design staff had significant concerns over the arrangement of the engine system. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] also posed a serious threat, as Lorient was well within the range of Allied bombers. The ship was eventually retaken by the French Navy after the end of the war, and launched in 1946.&lt;ref name=G77&gt;Gröner, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; She was ultimately completed in 1956 as an anti-aircraft cruiser.&lt;ref name=GC266/&gt;

===Characteristics===
The converted ship would have been {{convert|180.4|m|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|192.5|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. She would have had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.4|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.6|m|abbr=on}} as designed. Her designed displacement would have been {{convert|11400|LT}}.&lt;ref name=G76&gt;Gröner, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's propulsion system consisted of two sets of [[Rateau-Bretagne]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, with steam supplied by four [[Indret]] ultra-high-pressure boilers. The engines were rated at {{convert|10000|shp|lk=in}} and would have provided a top speed of {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}. The carrier would have had a range of {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|19|kn|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gröner, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

As converted, the ship was to be armed with several anti-aircraft guns. The heavy anti-aircraft battery consisted of twelve [[10.5 cm FlaK 38|{{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} SK C/33]] guns in twin mountings.&lt;ref name=G77/&gt; The mounts were the Dopp LC/31 type, originally designed for earlier [[8.8 cm SK C/31 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} SK C/31 guns]]. The LC/31 mounting was triaxially stabilized and capable of elevating to 80°. This enabled the guns to engage targets up to a ceiling of {{convert|12500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets, the guns had a maximum range of {{convert|17700|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; The guns fired fixed ammunition weighing {{convert|15.1|kg|abbr=on}}; the guns could fire HE and HE incendiary rounds, as well as illumination shells.&lt;ref name=C248&gt;Campbell, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Close-range anti-aircraft weaponry consisted of twelve [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|abbr=on}} SK C/30]] guns and twenty-four [[2 cm FlaK 30/38/Flakvierling|{{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} Flak 38]] guns.&lt;ref name=G77/&gt; The 3.7&amp;nbsp;cm gun was a single-shot gun, with a [[rate of fire]] of around 30&amp;nbsp;rounds per minute. At its maximum elevation of 85°, the gun had a ceiling of {{convert|6800|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; The 2&amp;nbsp;cm gun was a magazine-fed automatic weapon, firing at up to 500&amp;nbsp;rounds per minute. Twenty and forty-round magazines were supplied for the guns;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's aircraft facilities consisted of a {{convert|177.5|m|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|24|m|abbr=on}} wide flight deck and two elevators. Aircraft were handled in a single hangar, which was {{convert|142|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|18.6|m|abbr=on}} wide. The ship's air complement was to have consisted of eleven [[Bf 109]] fighters and twelve [[Ju 87]] Stuka dive-bombers.&lt;ref name=G77/&gt; The Bf&amp;nbsp;109 fighters were a [[navalized]] version of the &quot;E&quot; model, designated as Bf 109T. Their wings were longer than the land-based model to allow for shorter take-off.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell &amp; Muller, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The Ju&amp;nbsp;87s were to have been the &quot;E&quot; variant, which was a navalized version of the Ju&amp;nbsp;87D, and were modified for [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] launches and were equipped with [[arresting gear]].&lt;ref&gt;Kay &amp; Couper, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
