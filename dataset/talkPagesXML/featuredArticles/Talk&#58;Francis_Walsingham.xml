==Untitled==
I'm curious what 'Fire Over England ' has to do with Francis Walsingham.  There seems to be a spying theme, but no link to Francis in particular.

== The last bit about fiction ==
I'm also curious as to why the last bit was written.  It seems to have been written solely to take a jab at the movie &lt;i&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/i&gt; without offering any insight as to why the character of Walsingham was not portrayed accurately.  I would think that this portion of the article could easily be removed without harming the otherwise informative writeup.  

--[[User:Airosche|Airosche]] 18:36, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Also, wasn't Walsingham portrayed in that HBO movie made in 2006?

If you are referring to the &quot;gloriously inaccurately&quot; comment, it is a while since I saw the film, but I seem to remember Walsingham is shown as a. not religious b. probably homosexual c. sleeping with and murdering Marie de Guise; none of these is at all accurate.  The film's portrait stresses the Machivellianism dimension which would certainly have pained Walsingham who saw himself as a devout Protestant fighting for his country's life.

== Date of birth? ==
''Sir Francis Walsingham (c. 1530 – April 6, 1590) is remembered by history as…''

''Francis Walsingham was born in Scadbury Park, Chislehurst, Kent in about 1532 ''

Which is it? 1530 or 1532? Yes, I realize they're both hedged as &quot;circa&quot; or &quot;about,&quot; but the article should be consistent one way or the other. Which is the more likely birth date?  --[[Dodiad]] 06:26  29 Jul 2006 (UTC)

== Burial place? ==
Anyone know where Walsingham was buried, or entombed? --[[User:Mksmith|Michael K. Smith]] ([[User talk:Mksmith|talk]]) 02:15, 24 April 2008 (UTC)

He was buried in Sir Philip Sidney's tomb in (old) St Paul's and therefore his memorial disappeared in the Great Fire [[User:Mleimon|Mleimon]] ([[User talk:Mleimon|talk]]) 20:35, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

==Edward Stafford==
The statement about Walsingham &quot;winning&quot; over Stafford is simply not borne out by the evidence, I am afraid: The fullest account (the only one using the original Spanish sources, not the translated calendars) so far is the article by [[Geoffrey Parker]]: &quot;Treason and Plot in Elizabethan Diplomacy: The 'Fame of Sir Edward Stafford' Reconsidered&quot; in ''Success Is Never Final'' by the same author (2002). There can be no doubt that Stafford was the best mole the Spaniards had, and Walsingham did not neutralise him before the Armada, when it would have mattered.
So, since there is no reference given, I removed the last sentence about Walsingham and Stafford.

== Walsingham in Fiction updated ==
Changed the ownership in [[Elizabeth_I_(tv series)]] 2005 from [[HBO]] to the actual producers [[Channel Four]] HBO were just the US distributors.[[User:Twobells|Twobells]] ([[User talk:Twobells|talk]]) 12:45, 9 June 2010 (UTC)

I think it best to group literary references together [[User:Sceptic1954|Sceptic1954]] ([[User talk:Sceptic1954|talk]]) 15:00, 11 July 2013 (UTC)
:Davies, Watson and Camden are contemporaries writing eulogistic descriptions of the real man. This is quite different from the modern-day fictional portrayals. [[User:DrKiernan|DrKiernan]] ([[User talk:DrKiernan|talk]]) 15:03, 11 July 2013 (UTC)

Okay, leave it there.  Do you have a link to Watson's eulogy? [[User:Sceptic1954|Sceptic1954]] ([[User talk:Sceptic1954|talk]]) 15:07, 11 July 2013 (UTC)
:Having found and added a reference to Watson's poem I think the death section is too heavy now and we should have a literature section divided into poetry and novels [[User:Sceptic1954|Sceptic1954]] ([[User talk:Sceptic1954|talk]]) 15:20, 11 July 2013 (UTC)
::I see nothing wrong with the length of the section. [[User:DrKiernan|DrKiernan]] ([[User talk:DrKiernan|talk]]) 15:27, 11 July 2013 (UTC)

I didn't mean length, it's rather a bit too much detail which may be better separately[[User:Sceptic1954|Sceptic1954]] ([[User talk:Sceptic1954|talk]]) 16:20, 11 July 2013 (UTC)

:Dr.Kiernan The MOS point you raised can be easily bypassed, there's another poem, by Spenser to be added and the points can be fleshed out a little.  It strikes me that many of those interested i n his death will not be interested in the poetry whilst those who may be interested in the poetry may not find it if it is buried away with the account of his death.  Do you have any especial objection to a separate sub-section on Walsingham in poetry.  It strikes me that all artistic references should go together in the same general section? [[User:Sceptic1954|Sceptic1954]] ([[User talk:Sceptic1954|talk]]) 23:32, 11 July 2013 (UTC)

== Chef? ==
Under &quot;Walsingham's Interests&quot;, there is a sentence &quot;His chef was noteworthy.&quot; What does this mean? Did he have an interest in cooking, or was he a publicist for his cook...? [[User:Norman21|Norman21]] ([[User talk:Norman21|talk]]) 20:38, 12 October 2010 (UTC)
:The above seems to have been written on  21:02, 5 February 2009 by Mleimon. Can anyone verify it? [[User:Norman21|Norman21]] ([[User talk:Norman21|talk]]) 19:06, 27 October 2010 (UTC)

== Related Music ==
Would it be frivolous to list the instrumental song &quot;Walsingham&quot; (written by John Dowland) at the bottom of the page? Title of song listed on [[Songs from the Labyrinth ]] (performed by Edin Karamzov). Would I need to do more than simply list the title and include some information about Dowland and research why the tune was titled &quot;Walsingham&quot;?
[[User:Whooshing|whooshing]] ([[User talk:Whooshing|talk]]) 13:23, 24 June 2012 (UTC)

==Protestant or Puritan==
Several books/texts list Walsingham as a Puritan yet he is listed here as a Protestant?  I was always lead to believe that Proestantism and Puritanism were bothe different?[[Special:Contributions/82.20.8.96|82.20.8.96]] ([[User talk:82.20.8.96|talk]]) 15:49, 22 July 2012 (UTC)
:Puritans are Protestants. The sources used in the article say he was Protestant and that there is no direct evidence he was a Puritan. [[User:DrKiernan|DrKiernan]] ([[User talk:DrKiernan|talk]]) 16:28, 22 July 2012 (UTC)

== Slavery ==

It is not clear if Walsingham benefitted financially from slavery. The article says he &quot;promoted&quot; the activities of Francis Drake.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.144.68.22|86.144.68.22]] ([[User talk:86.144.68.22|talk]]) 14:56, 8 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Drake was certainly involved in slavery. So was Elizabeth.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.144.68.22|86.144.68.22]] ([[User talk:86.144.68.22|talk]]) 12:04, 9 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::Hawkins, Cecil, Walsingham and Drake were all on good terms with each other in 1582.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.144.68.22|86.144.68.22]] ([[User talk:86.144.68.22|talk]]) 12:32, 9 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::::Walsingham's investment is already in the article. [[User:DrKiernan|DrKiernan]] ([[User talk:DrKiernan|talk]]) 15:08, 3 September 2013 (UTC)
:::::The article says &quot;Walsingham was amoung the promoters of Francis Drake's profitable 1578-1581 circumnavigation of the world&quot;. This does not says clearly if Walsingham's promotion was financial or not and does not clearly mention slavery. Walsingham was presiding over England when slavery was legal.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.123.215.180|213.123.215.180]] ([[User talk:213.123.215.180|talk]]) 13:57, 12 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
