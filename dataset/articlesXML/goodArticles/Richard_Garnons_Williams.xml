Colonel '''Richard Davies Garnons Williams''' (15 June 1856&amp;nbsp;– 27 September 1915){{efn|Official sources say 25 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/1763505/GARNONS-WILLIAMS,%20RICHARD%20DAVIES|title=CWGC - Casualty Details Garnons-Williams, Richard Davies|work=cwgc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} was a [[British Army]] officer and Welsh [[rugby union]] player who represented {{nrut|Wales}}, [[Brecon RFC|Brecon]] and [[Newport RFC|Newport]]. He played in the [[1880-81 Home Nations rugby union matches|first Wales international rugby union match]] in 1881.

Garnons Williams became an officer in the British Army in 1876, and retired from regular service in 1892, though he continued to serve in a voluntary capacity until 1906. Already aged 58 at the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], he rejoined the army and was killed in action in 1915.

==Early life and family==
Richard Garnons Williams was born on 15 June 1856 in [[Llowes]], [[Radnorshire]], the second child of the Reverend Garnons Williams of [[Abercamlais]], [[Powys]], and his wife Catherine Frances, the daughter of Fenton Hort, of [[Leopardstown]], [[Dublin]], and sister of [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lifelettersoffen01hortuoft Life and Letters of Fenton John Anthony Hort] Internet Archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; Garnons Williams was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford before being prepared for University by private tuition in Wimbledon, Surrey. He then went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in October 1874.{{sfn|Venn|2011|p=497}}{{sfn|Bebbington|2014}}

His siblings were Reverend Arthur, Richard Davies, Captain Aylmer Herbert, Gerald, Katharine Frances Helena, Annabella Mary, Hugh, who died an infant, Mark Penry Fenton, and Mary Elizabeth.{{sfn|Nicholas|2000|p=121}} Aylmer Herbert joined the [[Royal Navy]] in 1871 and, after receiving his commission in 1880, served until his retirement in 1902, having reached the rank of captain. He then took command of the training ship [[HMS Wellesley (1815)|HMS ''Cornwall'']] until 1904 when he was appointed to command the Lancashire Navy League Sea Training Home at Liscard. He died on 8 February 1916 aged 58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10107/3857999|title=DEATH OF CAPTAIN A H GARNONS WILLIAMS, RN|newspaper=The Brecon County Times|date=17 February 1916|accessdate=10 September 2015|publisher=William Henry Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald was married in April 1892 to Minnie Lilian Court, the youngest daughter of Major Henry Court of Iverfarne, Buckinghamshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://hdl.handle.net/10107/4429364 | title=Marriage of Mr Garnons Williams | publisher=Jones &amp; Son. | date=29 April 1892 | accessdate=10 September 2015 | newspaper=South Wales Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Penry was Fleet Surgeon aboard {{HMS|Hampshire}} and died when his vessel was wrecked in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://hdl.handle.net/10107/3858168 | title=THE LATE FLEET SURGEON GARNONS WILLIAMS | publisher=William Henry Clark | date=29 June 1916 | accessdate=10 September 2015 | newspaper=The Brecon County Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Garnons Williams married Alice Jessie Bircham on 8 January 1885.{{sfn|Venn|2011|p=497}} They had a daughter, Barbara, who married Captain Hume Buckley Roderick of the [[Welsh Guards]] on 9 November 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://hdl.handle.net/10107/4123247 | title=FORTHCOMING MARRIAGE | publisher=Brinley R.

==Rugby==
[[File:Wales1881.jpg|thumb|300px|Wales Rugby Team, 1881. Garnons Williams is standing at the far right of the back row.]]
After going up to Trinity College, Garnons Williams represented [[Cambridge University R.U.F.C.|Cambridge]] at rugby, but did not win a [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1981|pp=145–152}} He played three matches for [[Newport RFC]] in 1880, after he had joined the army: against Manchester Rangers (2 October), Gloucester (4 December), and [[Cardiff RFC|Cardiff]] (18 December).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackandambers.co.uk/Teams/Player?personId=101742#|title=Richard Williams|work=blackandambers.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 he was selected to represent {{nrut|Wales}} in its first ever match, against {{nrut|England}} on 19 February at Blackheath.{{sfn|McCrery|2014|pp=232–233}} The challenge to England came from [[Richard Mullock]] of Newport, who was not an official of the South Wales Football Union, but wanted to bring Wales up to the same level as the other home nations, rather than settle for playing against English and Irish provincial teams. England, for its part, had recently beaten {{nrut|Ireland}} by two tries and two goals to none, and the previous season had become the first winners of the [[Calcutta Cup]] by beating {{nrut|Scotland}} by three tries and two goals to one goal. The date offered to Mullock by the English [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU), 19 February, coincided with a match for the South Wales Cup between Llanelli and cup holders Swansea, thereby limiting Mullock's selection options.{{sfn|Richards|2014|pp=12–15}} England won by eight goals to nil.&lt;ref name=EW81/&gt; It was Garnons Williams' only appearance for Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Scrum|558|Richard Garnons Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Deciding to follow a military career Garnons Williams was accepted into the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military College Sandhurst]], and is also recorded as representing the Sandhurst rugby team. He completed his officer training in 1876, and was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant|sub-lieutenant]]{{efn|Following the [[Cardwell Reforms]] the British Army briefly used the rank of sub-lieutenant before settling on second lieutenant.}} on 26 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=24299|startpage=886|date=25 February 1876|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posted to the [[38th Regiment of Foot]], promoted [[first lieutenant|lieutenant]] on 17 January 1877, and with his [[brevet (military)|army rank]] (but not regimental seniority) backdated to his original commission as sub-lieutenant,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=24634|startpage=5610|date=18 October 1878|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a month later, on 17 February 1877, transferred to the [[7th Regiment of Foot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=24404|startpage=218|endpage=219|date=16 January 1877|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1885 he had been promoted to [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]], and his unit had been renamed the [[Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=25439|startpage=521|date=6 February 1885|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 10 January 1887 he was appointed [[adjutant]] of the 4th Battalion of the regiment, the [[Militia#United Kingdom|Militia]] unit of the regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=25666|startpage=338|date=21 January 1887|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A regular officer was normally given this post in Militia units to organise training and generally maintain standards. His posting lasted the usual 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=26243|startpage=135|date=8 January 1892|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then retired from the regular army on 4 May 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=26284|startpage=2550|date=3 May 1892|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 1894 he was commissioned [[major (United Kingdom)|major]] in the 1st (Brecknockshire) Volunteer Battalion, [[South Wales Borderers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=26539|startpage=4548|date=7 August 1894|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 1 November 1895 was appointed [[Brigade Major]] for the South Wales Brigade of the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=26679|startpage=6103|date=12 November 1895|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July 1899 he was granted the honorary rank of [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27097|startpage=4282|date=11 July 1899|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned his Volunteer commission on 26 May 1906, retaining his rank and with permission to continue wearing his uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27916|startpage=3662|date=25 May 1906|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
He rejoined the British Army shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]] and was posted to his original regiment, joining the 12th (Service) Battalion of the [[Royal Fusiliers]] as a major on 26 September 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=28960|supp=yes|startpage=8854|date=30 October 1914|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted temporary lieutenant colonel on 3 October 1914, and transferred back to the South Wales Borderers to command the Brecknockshire Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=28922|startpage=7819|date=2 October 1914|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith|1980|p=202}} He was later posted back to 12th Royal Fusiliers, and, according to official sources, was killed on 25 September 1915 while leading his battalion at the [[Battle of Loos]]. He is commemorated on the [[Loos Memorial|Loos Memorial to the Missing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=1763505 Casualty details—Garnons Williams, Richard Davies], [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]. Retrieved on 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/warstories/pages/rugbyinternationals.shtml Rugby Heroes who went to War] [[BBC Online]] Matthew Ferris, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At 59 years of age, he was the eldest of the 13 Wales international players to be killed during the war.

A soldier under the command of Colonel Garnons Williams wrote an account of his commanding officer's death, which puts the date of his death as 27 September. Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: &quot;I was very sorry for him, as we could not have had a better, braver officer. He was with us all the time in the front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody could get back to him.&quot; The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://hdl.handle.net/10107/3857874 | title=Col.
