'''Sir Wallace Alan Akers''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FRS}} (9 September 1888 – 1 November 1954) was a British chemist and industrialist. Beginning his academic career at Oxford he specialized in physical chemistry. During the Second World War, he was the director of the [[Tube Alloys]] project, a clandestine programme aiming to research and develop British atomic weapons capabilities, from 1941 to 1945. After the war he was director of research at [[Imperial Chemical Industries]]. He also served as a member of the Advisory Council of the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]], and the committee that drew up the organisation of what became the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]]. He died in 1954 at the age of 66.

==Biography==
Wallace Alan Akers was born in [[Walthamstow]], England, the second child of an accountant, Charles Akers, and his wife, Mary Ethelreda {{nee}} Brown. He was educated at Lake House School in [[Bexhill-on-Sea]], [[Essex]], and [[Aldenham School]] in [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;&gt;{{cite odnb |id=30359|title=Akers, Sir Wallace Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He entered [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he specialised in physical chemistry,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jstor&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lord |last1=Waverley |authorlink1=John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley |first2=Alexander |last2=Fleck |authorlink2=Alexander Fleck, 1st Baron Fleck |title=Wallace Alan Akers |jstor= 769238 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society |publisher=The Royal Society |volume=1 |date=November 1955 |pages=1–4 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1955.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating with [[first class honours]] in 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt;

After university, he joined [[Brunner Mond|Brunner Mond &amp; Company]] in [[Winnington]], [[Cheshire]], as a researcher. In 1924 he joined the [[Borneo Company Limited|Borneo Company]], where he served as its general manager in the Far East. He returned to England in 1928 to join [[Imperial Chemical Industries]], into which Brunner Mond had earlier merged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jstor&quot;/&gt; In 1931 he became the chairman of the Billingham division of ICI. This was mainly concerned with the manufacture of [[ammonia]] using hydrogen under high pressure, ammonia being one of the company's most profitable products at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt;

Between 1933 and 1936 he was involved in a project to produce synthetic petrol from the [[hydrogenation]] of coal. ICI executives envisaged competing with oil companies. It became clear that the process would not be competitive, but since it had defence implications, he sought government subsidies. In this he was opposed by Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], the [[permanent secretary]] at the [[Home Office]]. The change of government following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|October 1931 general election]] brought with it a change in policy, and he was able to secure some financial relief.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt;

A reorganisation of ICI in 1937 ended Akers' chairmanship of the Billingham division, and he was posted to ICI headquarters, where he worked closely with [[Holbrook Gaskell III|Holbrook Gaskell]]. At this time, Britain was starting to re-arm. Munitions contracts had began to roll in, and ICI expanded its production capacity. He became executive manager in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt;

During 1941 Akers was recruited by the British war-time government as director of the [[Tube Alloys]] project, a clandestine programme aiming to research and develop British atomic weapons capabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jstor&quot;/&gt; This helped galvanize both Britain and America to proceed down a path which led to the [[Manhattan Project]], and ultimately the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Edge of Mortal Crimes |first=Ritchie |last=Calder |authorlink=Ritchie Calder |journal=New Scientist |volume=23 |issue=410 | date=24 September 1964 |page=793 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=TEb8Qm5GamoC&amp;pg=PA793&amp;lpg=PA793&amp;dq=%22sir+wallace+akers%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sir%20wallace%20akers%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official Historian [[Margaret Gowing]] noted that &quot;No doubt Akers had been picked for his personality and drive that had been considered so important and which he possessed in abundance&quot;.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=108}}

Akers' ICI background led to difficulties when it came to dealing with the American Manhattan Project.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=172–173}} American officials such as [[Vannevar Bush]], [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]] and [[Leslie Groves]] saw him as &quot;an Imperial Chemical Industries man at heart&quot;,{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=271}} and he aroused American suspicions that British interest in [[atomic energy]] was with its commercial possibilities after the war.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=276}}  As a result, [[James Chadwick]] was appointed the head of the [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|British mission to the Manhattan Project]], but Akers remained director of Tube Alloys until the end of the war.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=173}}

In 1946 Akers returned to the Board of ICI where he served as director of research until April 1953, when he retired, having reached the compulsory retirement age of 65.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jstor&quot;/&gt; He established university research fellowships, and donated money to university laboratories for research purposes. In 1946, he established the Butterwick Research Laboratories to carry out fundamental research, unrelated to commercial objectives. They were later renamed the Akers Research Laboratories in his honour.{{sfn|Boyce|Everett|2003|p=17}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Jstor&quot;/&gt;

Akers was made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36309 |date=31 December 1943 |startpage=20 |supp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37407 |date=28 December 1945 |startpage=2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37502 |date=15 March 1946 |startpage=1387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both for his services to the war effort. He became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1953, and received honorary degrees of [[D.Sc.]] from [[Durham University]] and [[D.C.L.]] from [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jstor&quot;/&gt;

After his retirement, he remained a member of the Advisory Council of the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Jstor&quot;/&gt;  and was part of the three-man April 1953 committee that drew up the organisation of what became the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]]. He was a member of the [[National Gallery]]'s scientific advisory committee, later becoming a trustee, and was the treasurer of the [[Chemical Society]] from 1948 to 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt; He married Bernadette Marie La Marre in 1953, and died at their home in [[Alton, Hampshire]], on 1 November 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt;
