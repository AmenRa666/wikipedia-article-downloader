== Main goal ==

The main goal of the AK was the final uprising ([[Operation Tempest]]), ie. training of future officers and soldiers, collecting arms. Real resistance caused cruel German vengeance, eg. 100 Polish civilians killed for one German, so the AK preferred to act ouside pre-war Poland or in the East, where ethnic Poles consisted a minority.[[User:Xx236|Xx236]] ([[User talk:Xx236|talk]]) 10:05, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

'''Post-war''' paragraph is almost so long as the WWII one, it's biased.[[User:Xx236|Xx236]] ([[User talk:Xx236|talk]]) 10:07, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

One file isn't available.[[User:Xx236|Xx236]] ([[User talk:Xx236|talk]]) 10:09, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

== Operation Vistula ==

Operation Vistula was carried out by the communist forces of UB, KBW and LWP, not Armia Krajowa.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/94.75.112.142|94.75.112.142]] ([[User talk:94.75.112.142|talk]]) 20:04, 23 October 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Recent changes ==

I've already replied to this on my talk page, but I am resposting here, since this is where the discussion should take place:

In regard to this edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armia_Krajowa&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=489663950]:

The source, Timothy Snyder, specifically mentions [[Saugumas]] (Lithuanian police) rather than Lithuanian Defense Force, so we go with what the source says. The second source also references Saugumas. It may very well be true that AK fought against LDF as well (in fact, I'm pretty sure they did), but we need another source for that.

Likewise, the sources given talk about &quot;collaborators&quot;, not &quot;civilians&quot;. The one exception is of course the Dubinki massacre, itself a retaliatory action - but that's exactly what it is, an exception (as the source clearly states) rather than a rule - whereas the killing of Polish civilians by Saugumas was pretty much routine.

Hence I am going to restore original text.[[User:Volunteer Marek|&lt;font color=&quot;Orange&quot;&gt;Volunteer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;Marek&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:32, 28 April 2012 (UTC)

== Plan of section &quot;Interaction with other groups&quot; ==

Currently the section &quot;Interaction with other groups&quot; ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armia_Krajowa&amp;oldid=496089659#Interaction_with_other_groups]) has such subsections:

* Interaction with the Jewish community and Jewish resistance
* Interaction with the Lithuanian Nazi collaborators
* Interaction with Red Army and Soviet partisans
* Interaction with Ukrainian partisans and Nazi collaborators

Wouldn't it be better to shorten all those names to:

* Interaction with Jews
* Interaction with Lithuanians
* Interaction with Soviets
* Interaction with Ukrainians

Among other advantages, that would correct the, er, anomaly, of section &quot;''Interaction with the Lithuanian Nazi collaborators''&quot; starting with &quot;''Although Lithuanian and Polish resistance movements had in principle the same enemies – Nazi Germany and Soviet Union [...]''&quot;...

Afterwards, other problems with neutrality of this section could probably be solved. --[[User:Martynas Patasius|Martynas Patasius]] ([[User talk:Martynas Patasius|talk]]) 22:15, 9 June 2012 (UTC)

==Home Army==
I propose that this article be retitled from &quot;[[Armia Krajowa]]&quot; to &quot;[[Home Army]]&quot;, in the interest of making the specific subject – and, by extension, Poland and its history generally – more accessible to non-Poles.  [[User:Nihil novi|Nihil novi]] ([[User talk:Nihil novi|talk]]) 05:16, 9 April 2014 (UTC)
:*The way it sounds now, Armia Krajowa is so undeniably Polish that it does not even need a country description in its title, but Home Army, if we were to rename it, should really be the [[Polish Home Army]] to be understood... similar to any domestic army. Conversely, [[Wehrmacht]] is a good precedence for keeping it the way it is in my view.

::::The term &quot;''Armia Krajowa''&quot; is immediately recognizable as Polish only to a Pole (or perhaps another Slav), who can also pronounce it correctly.  To a non-Pole, it is not obviously Polish, and moreover will be mispronounced, even with the pronunciation guide.  
::::&quot;[[Wehrmacht]]&quot; is a different matter.  That term is much better known in the world, though it too will be mispronounced by many non-Germans.
::::&quot;[[Home Army]]&quot; already redirects to &quot;[[Armia Krajowa]]&quot;.  But I could, if necessary, settle for &quot;Polish Home Army&quot;.  
::::German history is much better known in the West than Polish history.  It's my purpose to make Polish history more widely familiar by removing needless linguistic impediments.  [[User:Nihil novi|Nihil novi]] ([[User talk:Nihil novi|talk]]) 09:01, 9 April 2014 (UTC)

I have thoroughly edited this article, making it grammatically, stylistically and ''vocabularily'' more readable and accurate.  I wanted to move &quot;''Armia Krajowa''&quot; to the normal English-language rendering, &quot;Home Army&quot;, but the system would not permit it.  It also wouldn't permit variants such as &quot;Polish Home Army&quot; or &quot;Home Army (Poland)&quot;, but it finally did accept the somewhat ungainly &quot;[[Poland's Home Army]]&quot;.

I think &quot;Poland's Home Army&quot; is still easier for non-Poles to work with than &quot;''Armia Krajowa''&quot;, but I would prefer the plain &quot;Home Army&quot;, which up to now redirected to &quot;''Armia Krajowa''&quot;.  I would appreciate it if someone versed in arranging title moves could assist with this.  [[User:Nihil novi|Nihil novi]] ([[User talk:Nihil novi|talk]]) 10:21, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

:*Sorry, you do not have the [[wp:consensus]] for what you just did. The regular channel is to request the [[WP:RM|Renaming of article]] and waiting for feedback. Instead, you chose a less desirable title only because it allowed you to rename the article on your own, without asking for opinion. I oppose it. My first choice was, and still is: '''Armia Krajowa''', similar to Wehrmacht, with no italics. BTW, thanks for other improvements [[User:Nihil novi|Nihil novi]]. [[User:Piotrus]] was already at it in 2005 and I'd like to see what he thinks also.

[[:Armia Krajowa]] → {{no redirect|Home Army}} – I am starting this requested move discussion on behalf of [[User:Nihil novi]], who asked for help with the RM procedure above.

I've copied and pasted the above here because I presume that it might be overlooked where it originally appeared.

I'm a little puzzled by the comment that &quot;a disambiguator is needed&quot;, since &quot;[[Home Army]]&quot; linked — and continues to link — to &quot;[[Armia Krajowa]]&quot;:  which suggests, to me, that there is no ambiguity.

*'''Comment'''. Let me clarify my view: I '''abstain''' with regards to Armia Krajowa vs Home Army, but I '''object''' to Home Army (Poland) as unnecessary. Google Book search shows that the primary context for the expression &quot;Home Army&quot; in English is AK. --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 06:06, 28 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support''' as the [[WP:UCN|common name]] in [[WP:UE|English]] sources.  The disambiguator is not needed as [[Home Army]] ''already directs here'' anyway.  — [[User talk:AjaxSmack|&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #000073;background:#4D4DA6;padding:2px;color:#F9FFFF;text-shadow:black 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Georgia&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''AjaxSmack'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 12:34, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support''' for moving from &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; to &quot;Home Army&quot;. Over the past fifteen years or so I've seen the usage in English language works change on this. Counter-intuitively, earlier &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; was actually more frequent - because it was mostly only written by specialists working in a narrow area. Over time as some elements of Polish history got more exposure in the West, non-specialists entered the conversation and they tended to use &quot;Home Army&quot;. This caused a flip around some kind of tipping point and now my sense is that the latter is more frequent. I also don't think (''oppose'') that the qualification &quot;(Poland)&quot; is needed (i.e. ''oppose'' &quot;Home Army (Poland&quot;)). A look into the sources and the subject shows that *this* particular Home Army is the primary topic here.[[User:Volunteer Marek|Volunteer Marek]] ([[User talk:Volunteer Marek|talk]]) 20:24, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
**Note: If this article does get moved, then we should also consider renaming the template [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Armia_Krajowa] (which is in bad need of reorganization, clean up and expansion).[[User:Volunteer Marek|Volunteer Marek]] ([[User talk:Volunteer Marek|talk]]) 22:47, 2 June 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support''', as proponent of the move from &quot;''[[Armia Krajowa]]''&quot; to &quot;[[Home Army]]&quot; (which latter term currently redirects back to &quot;''Armia Krajowa''&quot;).  I would tend to agree with [[User:Piotrus|Piotrus]], [[User:AjaxSmack|AjaxSmack]], and [[User:Volunteer Marek|Volunteer Marek]] that a disambiguation such as &quot;(Poland)&quot; is not essential, since the usual referent of the term &quot;[[Home Army]]&quot; is the [[World War II]] '''''[[Poland|Polish]]''''' Home Army.  The other military units listed in the &quot;[[Home Guard]]&quot; disambiguation page are &quot;home '''''guards'''''&quot; and the like.

Is it ok then if I also move the Armia Krajowa Template as well, for sake of consistency? [[User:Volunteer Marek|Volunteer Marek]] ([[User talk:Volunteer Marek|talk]]) 21:01, 3 June 2014 (UTC)

== Syntax screwup post-move ==

G'day {{ping|User:Kirill Lokshin}} Can you see what the problem is with this one? Since the recent move it has come up on [[:Category:Military history articles needing attention to tagging]], and I've moved the old MH peer review (had never struck one of those before...), but it's still stuck. Could you have a look? Thanks, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 08:24, 9 June 2014 (UTC)
:{{ping|Peacemaker67}} The issue was a broken link to the old A-Class review.  I've created a redirect from the new title, so the article should no longer be flagged as being tagged incorrectly.

== The name of the article ==

Greetings.
I think that the name should be moved from '''Home Army''' to '''The Polish Home Army''' while ''&quot;Home Army&quot;'' is too general and might lead to some confusion. It's just my suggestion. [[User:Yatzhek|Yatzhek]] ([[User talk:Yatzhek|talk]]) 15:18, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
::A recent RM decided that disambiguation isn't needed. See the above discussion. [[User:RGloucester|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000&quot;&gt;RGloucester &lt;/span&gt;]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 15:25, 18 June 2014 (UTC)

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Home Army]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=712547338 my edit]. You may add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it, if I keep adding bad data, but formatting bugs should be reported instead. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether, but should be used as a last resort. I made the following changes:
