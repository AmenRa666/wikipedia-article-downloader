'''David M. Jones''' (December 18, 1913 – November 25, 2008) was a [[United States Air Force]] pilot and general officer who served with distinction during [[World War II]].  He was one of the [[Doolittle Raid]]ers whose exploits in April 1942 were dramatized in the film ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]''.  He then flew combat missions over North Africa, where he was shot down.  He was a German prisoner of war for two and a half years &amp;mdash; helping with the April 1944 mass escape at [[Stalag Luft III]] .&lt;ref name=ArizonaStarDaily_Sottosanti_20081130/&gt;  

In his last assignment with the Air Force, Jones was the commander of the Air Force Eastern Test Range in [[Cape Canaveral|Cape Kennedy]], Florida as well as the [[U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Manager for Manned Space Flight Support Operations. He retired from the Air Force in 1973.

==Early years; education==
David Mudgett Jones was born on December 18, 1913 in [[Marshfield, Oregon]], the son of David Arthur (Dade) Jones and Grace Mudgett. His father Dade Jones, the son of Welsh immigrants, homesteaded land in Meadow Lake Township, North Dakota in 1896 before marrying Grace and moving to Oregon.

David Jones enlisted in the [[Arizona National Guard]] while he was attending the [[University of Arizona]] at [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], from 1932 to 1936.  His later education included three major [[U.S. military|Armed Forces]] schools: [[Command and General Staff School]] in [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas, 1946; [[Armed Forces Staff College]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], 1948; and the [[National War College]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], 1956.

Jones was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] a [[US Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]] in the [[U.S. Cavalry]] arm of the [[Arizona Army National Guard]], where he served one year of active duty before transferring to the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] and entering pilot training in June 1937. After earning his [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|wings]] in June 1938, he served as a [[Northrop A-17]] pilot with the [[95th Reconnaissance Squadron|95th Attack Squadron]] of the  [[17th Bombardment Group|17th Attack Group]], based at [[March Air Reserve Base|March Field]], California. 

In 1939 the 17th was re-designated a medium bombardment group and transferred to [[McChord Air Force Base|McChord Field]], Washington. By September 1941 it became the first unit of the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] to be fully equipped with the new [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] medium bomber.

==World War II==

===Doolittle Raid===
[[File:DoolittleRaiders Crew5 060217-F-1234P-113 1.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Doolittle Raider Crew No. 5: Front row: '''Capt. David M. Jones''', pilot; Lt. Rodney R. Wilder, copilot; back row: Lt. Eugene F. McGurl, navigator; Lt. [[Denver V. Truelove]], bombardier; Sgt. Joseph W. Manske, flight engineer/gunner.]]
In early 1942, Jones volunteered for the Doolittle Project &amp;mdash; a secret bombing raid to be launched on Japan in retaliation for the December 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=AFLink_20081202&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=December 2, 2008

|title=Airmen bid farewell to two Doolittle Raiders
|date=December 2, 2008
|work=Air Force Link |publisher=United States Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the training phase of this project, he acted as navigation and intelligence officer for the ad hoc squadron of B-25 bombers.  On April 18, 1942, the [[Doolittle Raid]] launched from the [[United States Navy]]'s aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8}}, dropping their bombs on [[Tokyo, Japan|Tokyo]] and four other Japanese cities.&lt;ref name=AFLink_20081202/&gt; This raid was the first good news that the Americans had from the [[Pacific War|Pacific front]].

Lacking the fuel to make a safe landing after the raid, Jones bailed out over [[China]], where he was assisted by the Chinese people in evading capture. He received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his participation as a flight commander in the planning, training and completion of the mission. After escaping capture, Jones was flown to India, where he spent three months with the [[22d Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron|22nd Bomb Squadron]] flying further B-25 missions against the Japanese.

===North Africa and Stalag Luft III===
[[File:Sagan harry-3.jpg|thumb|left|Scene of the &quot;Harry&quot; tunnel in Stalag Luft III.]]
In September 1942, Jones was assigned to the new [[319th Bombardment Group]], preparing for combat in [[North Africa Campaign|North Africa]]. He was assigned to develop low-level bombing tactics and techniques due to his experience with the Doolittle project and his belief in low-level bombing tactics. On December 4, 1942, he was shot down over [[Bizerte]], North Africa, and spent two and a half years as a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Stalag Luft III]].&lt;ref name=AFbio/&gt; As a result of his constant agitation and harassment of the enemy, he was selected for the &quot;escape committee&quot; by fellow prisoners. The committee reviewed escape plans and directed escapes.&lt;ref name=AFbio/&gt;  Jones led the digging team on tunnel &quot;Harry&quot; used in the ''Great Escape'', chronicled in the [[Paul Brickhill]]'s  [[The Great Escape (book)|autobiographical book]], and portrayed in the [[The Great Escape (film)|1963 film]].&lt;ref name=ArizonaStarDaily_Sottosanti_20081130&gt;

|work=Arizona Daily Star |date=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his liberation in April 1945, Jones was commended for leadership among his fellow prisoners.&lt;ref name=AFbio/&gt;

==Post-World War II==
In July 1946, Jones was assigned as an air inspector at Headquarters [[Air Training Command]].  He followed this with attendance at the Armed Forces Staff College, which he completed in 1948.  During this time, the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] was disestablished and his commission was transferred to the newly established [[United States Air Force]].  He then served as Director of War Plans at Headquarters [[Tactical Air Command]] at [[Langley AFB]], Virginia, followed by an assignment as Director of Combat Operations for the [[Ninth Air Force]]; then as Commander of the [[47th Bombardment Group]], until February 1952.

He was then the commander of the [[47th Bombardment Wing]] (a [[B-45 Tornado]] jetbomber wing) at [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia and at [[RAF Sculthorpe]], England until July 1955.&lt;ref name=AFbio/&gt;

===Test pilot===
[[File:B-58 Hustler.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;B-58 Hustler&lt;/center&gt;]]
Jones began working in [[research and development]] in 1956 when he was the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations for the [[Air Proving Ground Command]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida. His experience in bombardment-type aircraft and previous command staff assignments in research and development resulted in his being selected director of the [[B-58 Hustler|B-58]] Test Force, organized in February 1958 at [[Carswell Air Force Base]], Texas. The B-58 Hustler was the first operational jet [[bomber]] capable of Mach 2 [[supersonic]] flight.  During this time, Jones continued to maintain his flight status in the B-58, [[F-102 Delta Dagger|TF-102]], and [[T-33 Shooting Star|T-33]] aircraft;  participating in design speed dashes, low-level penetrations, night, weather, formation and inflight refueling missions. He had more supersonic time testing the [[B-58 Hustler|B-58]] than any senior U.S. Air Force pilot.

In September 1960, he became vice commander of the Wright Air Development Division at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], Ohio.  In October 1961, he was named program manager of the [[GAM-87]] &quot;Skybolt&quot; at [[Air Force Systems Command]]'s Aeronautical Systems Division. When that project was cancelled, he became ASD deputy for systems management and later vice commander.

In August 1964, he became deputy chief of staff for systems at Headquarters [[Air Force Systems Command]] at [[Andrews Air Force Base]], Maryland, which had responsibility for all USAF research, development, and weapon system acquisition.

===NASA===
In December 1964, Jones became Deputy Assistant Administrator for Manned Space Flight with the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA).&lt;ref name=NASA_part2a/&gt; In July 1965, he was given responsibility for development of the [[S-IVB]] Orbital Workshop and spent-stage experiment support module (SSESM) &amp;mdash; a concept of &quot;in-orbit&quot; conversion of a spent S-IVB stage to a shelter.&lt;ref name=NASA_part2a/&gt; In August 1965, he took on the additional duties as of the Saturn/Apollo Applications (SAA) Acting Director.&lt;ref name=NASA_part2a&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 3, 2008

Then, in May 1967, he assumed duties as commander of the [[Air Force Eastern Test Range]], [[Patrick AFB]] and [[Cape Canaveral AFS|Cape Kennedy AFS]], Florida.

==Retirement; death==
Jones retired at the rank of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] on May 31, 1973. He was one of five Doolittle Raiders who later became [[general officer]]s;&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 6, 2008

|title=The Doolittle Tokyo Raiders}}&lt;/ref&gt; the others are [[Jimmy Doolittle|James H. Doolittle]], John A. Hilger, Everett W. Holstrom, and [[Richard A. Knobloch]].
