'''Egon Mayer''' (19 August 1917&amp;nbsp;– 2 March 1944) was a German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[military aviation|military aviator]] during [[World War II]], a [[fighter ace]] credited with 102 enemy aircraft shot down in over 353 combat missions. His victories were all claimed over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] and included 26 four-engine bombers, 51 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s and 12 [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s. Mayer was the first fighter pilot to score 100 victories entirely on the Western Front.

Born in [[Konstanz]], Mayer, who was a [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] pilot in his youth, volunteered for military service in the ''Luftwaffe'' of the [[Third Reich]] in 1937. Following flight training he was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 2|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2]] &quot;Richthofen&quot; (JG 2—2nd Fighter Wing) in 1939. He fought in the [[Battle of France]] and claimed his first aerial victory in that campaign on 13 June 1940. Mayer was appointed ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of the 7. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (7th squadron) of JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot; in June 1941. Two months later, following his 21st aerial victory, he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 1 August 1941. He claimed 16 further victories and was awarded the [[German Cross]] in Gold on 16 July 1942. In November 1942, Mayer was appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of the III. ''[[Luftwaffe Organization#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (3rd group) of JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot;.

Mayer claimed his first victories over [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) four-engine bombers when he shot down two [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es and a [[B-24 Liberator]] on 23 November 1942. Together with fellow fighter ace [[Georg-Peter Eder]], Mayer developed the head-on attack as the most effective tactic against the Allied daylight heavy [[combat box]] bomber formations. He received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] on 16 April 1943 after 63 victories. On 1 July 1943, he replaced [[Walter Oesau]] as ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander) of JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot;. He claimed his 90th victory on 31 December 1943 and on 5 February 1944 became the first pilot on the Channel Front to reach 100 victories. Mayer was [[killed in action]] on 2 March 1944 while leading an attack on a USAAF bomber formation; he was shot down by P-47 Thunderbolt [[escort fighter]]s near [[Montmédy]], France. He was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] that day.

==Early life and career==
Mayer, the son of a farmer, was born on 19 August 1917 in [[Konstanz]] at the [[Bodensee]]. Konstanz at the time was in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] of the [[German Empire]]. Mayer grew up on his parents' farm named ''Hauserhof'' and spent his spare time at the [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] airfield at the [[Bellenberg]] near [[Engen, Germany|Engen]]. He went to school at the ''Langemarck-Realgymnasium''—a secondary school built on the mid-level ''[[Realschule]]'' to achieve the ''[[Abitur]]'' (university entry qualification)—in [[Singen]]. Today, the ''Langemarck-Realgymnasium'', which had been named after the location of the World War I [[First Battle of Ypres|Battle of Langemarck]], is the [[Hegau-Gymnasium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p124&quot;&gt;Stockert 1997, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hegau-Gymnasium Südfront.JPG|thumb|right|The Hegau-Gymnasium in Singen]]
Following his graduation, Mayer volunteered for military service in the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' on 1 November 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p124&quot;/&gt; His military training began at the 2nd Air Warfare School (''[[RAF Gatow|Luftkriegsschule 2]]'') at [[Gatow]], on the southwestern outskirts of Berlin.{{refn|Flight training in the ''Luftwaffe'' progressed through the levels A1, A2 and B1, B2, referred to as A/B flight training. A training included theoretical and practical training in aerobatics, navigation, long-distance flights and dead-stick landings. The B courses included high-altitude flights, instrument flights, night landings and training to handle the aircraft in difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} He was then trained as a fighter pilot and promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (second lieutenant) on 1 August 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p124&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
World War II in Europe began on Friday, 1 September 1939, when German forces [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. Mayer received the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class ({{Lang|de|''Eisernes Kreuz 2. Klasse''}}) on 25 October 1939 and was transferred to [[Jagdgeschwader 2|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2]] &quot;Richthofen&quot; (JG 2—2nd Fighter Wing), named after the after World War I fighter ace [[Manfred von Richthofen]], on 6 December 1939.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)|Organization of the ''Luftwaffe'' during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt; For his entire combat career, with the exception of a brief posting to the fighter pilot school at [[Werneuchen]], Mayer would serve in JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot;. He claimed his first aerial victory on 13 June 1940 during the [[Battle of France]], shooting down an ''[[Armée de l'Air]]'' (French Air Force) [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p124&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Battle of Britain]], Mayer often flew over the [[English Channel]] as the [[wingman]] of [[Helmut Wick]]. He claimed three further victories in this campaign, all over [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s, but was himself shot down or [[forced landing|forced to land]] at the French Coast. Once he had to swim in the Channel for an hour before he was rescued. At the end of 1940 Mayer had four victories to his credit and JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot; was withdrawn from combat to replenish the heavy losses it had sustained. Following a short tour as fighter pilot instructor at the ''[[Jagdfliegerschule]]'' (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, Mayer was sent back to the Channel Front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p124&quot;/&gt;

On 10 June 1941, ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (First Lieutenant) Mayer was appointed ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of 7. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (7th squadron) of JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot;, based at [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise|Saint-Pol]]-[[Brias]]. He claimed his 19th and 20th victory on 23 July 1941 and was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes''}}) on 1 August 1941 after his 21st aerial victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p124&quot;/&gt; He received the award with fellow JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot; pilots ''Oberleutnant'' [[Erich Leie]] and ''Oberleutnant'' [[Rudolf Pflanz]] on that day. The triple award presentation was recorded by the ''[[Die Deutsche Wochenschau|Deutsche Wochenschau]]'' (German Weekly Review),  a [[newsreel]] series released in the cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2000, pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; His score had increased to 28 aerial victories by the end of 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p124&quot;/&gt;

Mayer received the [[German Cross]] in Gold ({{Lang|de|''Deutsches Kreuz in Gold''}}) on 16 July 1942. On 19 August, his 25th birthday, Mayer shot down two Spitfires over Dieppe during [[Operation Jubilee]], his 49th and 50th victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p124&quot;/&gt;

===Group commander===

Mayer was promoted to ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (captain) and was appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of III. ''Gruppe'' of JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot; in November 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p125&quot;&gt;Stockert 1997, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 November, Mayer claimed his first victories over [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) four-engined bombers, when he shot down two [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses]] and a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]]. Together with [[Georg-Peter Eder]], Mayer developed the head-on attack as the most effective tactic against the Allied daylight heavy [[combat box]] bomber formations.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1999, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was based on a ''Kette'' (chain), three aircraft flying in a [[Vic formation|&quot;V&quot; formation]], attacking from ahead and to the left. When in range, the attackers opened fire with a [[Deflection (ballistics)|deflection burst]], aiming in front of the enemy aircraft. Following the attack, the pilots would pull up sharply to the left or right. This gave the attacking fighters the best chance of avoiding the massed firepower of the bombers' guns.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth 2011, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 1943, Mayer shot down three RAF [[Hawker Typhoon]]s, claiming his 60th to 62nd victories. Following his 63rd victory he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub''}}) on 16 April 1943, the 232nd officer or soldier of the Wehrmacht so honored. The presentation was made by [[Adolf Hitler]] in his office at the [[Reich Chancellery]] in Berlin on 11 May 1943. Mayer was then promoted to ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (major) on 1 June 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p126&quot;&gt;Stockert 1997, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1943, Mayer encountered [[Robert S. Johnson]], a future ace from the [[56th Fighter Group]] of the US [[Eighth Air Force]]. Johnson's [[Republic P-47D Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolt]] had been badly shot-up by some [[Focke Wulf Fw 190]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy that would not open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw-190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock to give it the [[coup de grace|''coup de grâce'']]. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1999, pp. 169–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 1943, a flight led by Mayer encountered an RAF Spitfire unit. During the course of the engagement, he claimed one Spitfire shot down and damage to another. He shot down three USAAF P-47s on 26 June 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p126&quot;/&gt;

===Wing commander and death===
Mayer was appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander) of JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot; on 1 July 1943, thus succeeding ''[[Oberst]]'' (Colonel) [[Walter Oesau]]. Command of III. ''Gruppe'' was passed on to the ''Staffelkapitän'' of 8. ''Staffel'', ''Hauptmann'' [[Bruno Stolle]].&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2000, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed three B-17s shot down within 19 minutes on 6 September. The Eighth Air Force was targeting [[Stuttgart]] that day and lost 45 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2000, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December 1943, Mayer shot down three P-47 Thunderbolts. His claimed aerial victories increased to 90 on 30 December 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p126&quot;/&gt; Mayer was credited with four victories on 7 January 1944, three B-24s and one B-17 shot down in the vicinity of [[Orléans]].&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2012, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February 1944 he claimed his 100th victory, the first fighter pilot on the Channel Front to achieve this mark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p126&quot;/&gt;

Mayer's final score stood at 102 when he was shot down and [[killed in action]] by a P-47 Thunderbolt near [[Montmédy]] on 2 March 1944. Flying [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] A-6 (factory number 470468), Mayer had led his ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Stabsschwarm]]'' (headquarters unit) and elements of III. ''Gruppe'', 14 Fw 190s in total, in an attack on B-17s in the area of [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]], but failed to detect the fighter escort of 29 P-47s {{Convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} above. His aircraft was seen taking hits at a range of {{Convert|400|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} in the nose and cockpit. It made a violent [[snap roll]] and went into a vertical dive, crashing within {{Convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} of Montmédy.&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2000, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously decorated with the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern''}}) that day.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier 1986, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research by historian Norman Fortier suggests that Mayer was shot down by Lieutenant Walter Gresham of the [[358th Fighter Squadron]] of the [[355th Fighter Wing]]. The claim is based on [[gun camera]] footage and recollections of Mayer's wingman, who was forced to bail out during the action.&lt;ref&gt;Fortier 2003, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer was buried at the cemetery of [[Beaumont-le-Roger]], France, and in 1955 re-interred at the German War Cemetery in St. Desiré de [[Lisieux]].&lt;ref&gt;Stockert 1997, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
