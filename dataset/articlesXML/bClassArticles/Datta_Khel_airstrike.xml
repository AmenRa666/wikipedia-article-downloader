{{War in North-West Pakistan}}
The '''Datta Khel airstrike''' was an American airstrike carried out on 17 March 2011 in [[Datta Khel]], [[North Waziristan]] that killed 44 people and led to widespread condemnation in [[Pakistan]].  Sherabat Khan Wazir, a top commander of [[Hafiz Gul Bahadur]]'s [[Taliban]] faction, was killed in the strike, and in response Bahadur threatened to end the peace deal struck with the Pakistani government almost four years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;et20110321&quot;/&gt;  The airstrike was part of a long series of [[drone attacks in Pakistan]] carried out by the [[CIA]] and [[United States]] military.  It occurred just two days after ''[[diyya]]'', a form of compensation paid to a victim's family under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], was paid for the release of U.S. CIA operative [[Raymond Allen Davis incident|Raymond Allen Davis]], signaling a resumption of U.S. activity after a several week hiatus while Davis' pardon on murder charges was being negotiated.

==Attack==
According to Pakistani intelligence officials, the attack targeted a compound where several dozen people believed to be [[Taliban]] militants linked to Hafiz Gul Bahadur were meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;tele&quot;&gt;{{cite web | location = UK | url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8388295/Drone-attack-kills-38.html | title=Drone attack kills 38 | accessdate=17 March 2011 | date=17 March 2011 | publisher=The Telegraph|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5xG6hbQMb |archivedate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March 2011, two&lt;ref name=&quot;al jazeera&quot; /&gt; or three&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; missiles were fired within three minutes, killing at least 44 people and injuring around fifteen others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aaj.tv/2011/03/death-toll-reaches-44-in-drone-attack/ | title=Death toll reaches 44 in Drone attack | accessdate=19 March 2011 | date=18 March 2011 | publisher=AAJ News | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xIqp55Lo | archivedate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A security official in [[Peshawar]] said that the building that was attacked was used as a training location and meeting place for militants.&lt;ref name=&quot;al jazeera&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/03/20113178411386630.html | title=Dozens die as US drone hits Pakistan home | accessdate=17 March 2011 | date= 17 March 2011 | publisher=Al Jazeera|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xG6jLBX8 | archivedate = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A car that was transporting additional suspected militants near the location of the primary target was also fired upon.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;

Of those killed, a Pakistani security official said that eleven Taliban personnel were killed in the attack, while the remainder were civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/world/asia/18pakistan.html | title=Drone Attack Kills Civilians in Pakistan | accessdate=17 March 2011 | date=17 March 2011 | publisher=The New York Times | location = USA |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5xG6lJ6ge | archivedate = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a local tribesman, however, the suspected militants were actually a group of tribal elders from a nearby village who were having a business meeting.&lt;ref name= &quot;reuters&quot; /&gt; The meeting was said to be regarding the disputed sale of a [[chromite]] mine in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-03/17/c_13784458.htm | title=80 people reportedly killed in US drone strike in Pakistan | accessdate=17 March 2011 | date=17 March 2011 | publisher=Xinhua | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5xGDwR2UV | archivedate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribesman said that a commander loyal to Bahadur, Sharabat Khan, was present, but only because he was also a tribal elder.&lt;ref name = &quot;reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE72G1W520110317?sp=true | title=Suspected US drone strike in Pakistan, 38 killed | accessdate=17 March 2011 | date=17 March 2011 | publisher=Reuters Africa|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5xG6eCpFP|archivedate = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan was reported to have been killed in the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;  After the attack the Taliban faction led by Hafiz Gul Bahadur threatened to cancel the peace deal with Pakistani government to protest the governments inability to halt drone attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;et20110321&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/135711/waziristan-drone-attack-taliban-faction-threatens-scrapping-peace-deal/|title=Waziristan drone attack: Taliban faction threatens scrapping peace deal|last=Khan|first=Zia|date=21 March 2011|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
General [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]], the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] of [[Pakistan Army]], issued a statement saying that the attack was &quot;in complete violation of human rights&quot; and that &quot;such aggression against people of Pakistan is unjustified and intolerable under any circumstances.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12779232 | title= Pakistan army chief Kayani in US drone outburst | accessdate=17 March 2011 | date=17 March 2011 | publisher=BBC | work = News Online|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5xG6nHssv |archivedate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] condemned the attack, saying that it would only strengthen the hands of militants.  The governor of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Syed Masood Kausar]], also strongly condemned the attack, saying that civilians and policemen were killed.&lt;ref name= &quot;tribune&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://tribune.com.pk/story/133842/drone-strike-kills-8-in-datta-khel/ | title =Gen Kayani condemns 'unjustifiable' drone strike|work=The Express Tribune| accessdate = 17 March 2011|date=18 March 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGFsnCAV| archivedate = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan foreign secretary [[Salman Bashir]] asked the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, [[Cameron Munter]], for an explanation and an apology.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ20110317&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703818204576206873567985708.html | title = Pakistan Slams US Drone Strike | last = Wright | first = Tom | date = 17 March 2011| publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate= 18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the attack, Pakistan said it would not attend talks with the United States on 26 March 2011 in Brussels to discuss the future of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap&quot;/&gt;  The foreign ministry of Pakistan stated that &quot;[i]t is evident that the fundamentals of our relations need to be revisited…  Pakistan should not be taken for granted nor treated as a [[client state]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap&quot;/&gt;  The US embassy in Pakistan refused to comment, saying it was not aware that such talks had been proposed.&lt;ref name= &quot;ap&quot;&gt;{{cite news| publisher = Google | work = Hosted news | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5guMJa4CfkfZdbWn7JkqUjzl_UXag?docId=afea5695a7c34020b9025e6da2b02ca0|title=After strike, Pakistan cancels US-Afghan talks|date=18 March 2011| agency =Associated Press|accessdate=18 March 2011|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5xHZXwYAX |archivedate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack came shortly after CIA contractor [[Raymond Allen Davis incident|Raymond Allen Davis]], who had been arrested on charges of killing two people in January, was released, and protests against his release were expected to intensify after the [[unmanned combat air vehicle|drone strike]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tele&quot;/&gt;

===Protests===
Thousands of Pakistani protesters took to the street following the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;nl20110318&quot;/&gt;  The US Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]] and [[Peshawar]] were closed due to security concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;nl20110318&quot;/&gt;  Thousands of protesters gathered in the capital [[Islamabad]], chanting &quot;[f]riends of the US are traitors&quot;, &quot;[d]own with America&quot; and &quot;[h]ang Zardari.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nl20110318&quot;/&gt;  In [[Miranshah]] more than a thousand locals collected and demanded compensation for the dead and an immediate stop to the drone attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;nl20110318&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/pakistanis-rally-against-the-us/story-fn6sb9br-1226024415214|title=Pakistanis rally against the US | date = 18 March 2011 |work=[[News Limited]]|accessdate=18 March 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xHbQ4GBT| archivedate = 18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
