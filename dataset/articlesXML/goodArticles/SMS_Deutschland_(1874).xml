'''SMS ''Deutschland''''' {{efn|name=SMS}} was the second and final ship of the {{sclass|Kaiser|ironclad}}s; {{SMS|Kaiser|1874|6}} was her sister ship. Named for Germany (''Deutschland'' in German), the ship was laid down in the [[Samuda Brothers]] shipyard in London in 1872. The ship was launched in September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet in July 1875. ''Deutschland'' mounted a main battery of eight {{convert|26|cm|abbr=on}} guns in a central battery [[amidships]]. She was the last [[capital ship]] built for the German Navy by a foreign ship-builder; all subsequent ships were built in Germany.

''Deutschland'' served with the fleet from her commissioning until 1896, though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted with the exception of the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels. She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean, often escorting Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] on official state visits. ''Deutschland'' was rebuilt in the early 1890s as an [[armored cruiser]], though she was too slow to perform satisfactorily in this role. Nevertheless, she spent three years in the [[German East Asia Squadron|East Asia Squadron]] before returning to Germany in 1900. She was used in secondary roles after 1904, until 1908 when she was sold and broken up for scrap.

[[File:SMS Kaiser linedrawing.png|thumb|left|Line-drawing of SMS ''Deutschland'']]

''Deutschland'' was ordered by the Imperial Navy from the [[Samuda Brothers]] shipyard in [[London]], UK; her keel was laid in 1872.{{sfn|Gröner|p=6}} ''Deutschland'' and her sister ''Kaiser'' were ordered shortly after the end of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], under the assumption that the French would quickly attempt a war of revenge.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=109}} The ship was launched on 12 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 20 July 1875.{{sfn|Gröner|p=7}} ''Deutschland'' cost the German government 8,240,000&amp;nbsp;[[German gold mark|gold marks]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=6}} She was the last German [[capital ship]] built by a foreign shipbuilder.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Naval Warfare''|p=120}}

The ship was {{convert|89.34|m|ft|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a beam of {{convert|19.10|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a draft of {{convert|7.39|m|ft|abbr=on}} forward.{{sfn|Gröner|p=6}} ''Deutschland'' was powered by one 2-cylinder [[single expansion engine]], which was supplied with steam by eight coal-fired trunk boilers. The ship's top speed was {{convert|14.6|kn}}, at {{convert|5779|ihp}}. She was also equipped with a [[Full rigged ship|full ship rig]]. Her standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 568 enlisted men.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=6–7}}

She was armed with eight {{convert|26|cm|in|abbr=on}} L/20 guns mounted in a central battery amidships. As built, the ship was also equipped with a single {{convert|21|cm|in|abbr=on}} L/22 gun.{{sfn|Gröner|p=6}} After being rebuilt in 1891–1895, her armament was increased by six {{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} L/22 and one 8.8&amp;nbsp;cm L/30 guns, four and later twelve {{convert|3.7|cm|abbr=on}} [[auto-cannon]]s, and five {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes, all mounted in the ship's hull.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=6–7}} ''Deutschland''{{'}}s armor was made of [[wrought iron]] and backed with [[teak]]. The armored belt was {{convert|127|to|254|mm|abbr=on}} thick; this was backed with {{convert|90|to|226|mm|in|abbr=on}} of teak.{{sfn|Gröner|p=6}}

== Service history ==
[[File:SMS Deutschland before 1896 .jpg|thumb|left|''Deutschland'' in her original configuration]]
Following her commissioning in July 1875, a German crew sailed ''Deutschland'' to Germany. She arrived too late, however, to participate in the annual summer training maneuvers. The ship was ready for the 1876 maneuvers; the squadron consisted of ''Deutschland'', her sister {{SMS|Kaiser|1874|2}}, and the older ironclads {{SMS|Friedrich Carl|1867|2}} and {{SMS|Kronprinz|1867|2}}, commanded by Rear Admiral [[Carl Ferdinand Batsch]]. At around the time Batch's squadron was working up for the summer cruise, the German consul in [[Salonika]], then in the [[Ottoman Empire]], was murdered. Further attacks on German citizens living in the area were feared, and so Batsch was ordered to sail to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to stage a naval demonstration in June 1876. After arriving with the four ironclads, he was reinforced by three unarmored vessels. After the threat of violence subsided in August, Batsch departed with ''Kaiser'' and ''Deutschland''; the other two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean for the rest of the summer.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=122}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 116-125-36, Port Arthur, SMS &quot;Deutschland&quot; im Hafen.jpg|thumb|SMS ''Deutschland'' in 1898 at [[Lüshunkou District|Port Arthur]], China]]
For the 1877 maneuvers, the new turret ironclad {{SMS|Preussen|1873|2}} replaced ''Kronprinz''. The squadron was again sent to the Mediterranean, in response to unrest in the Ottoman Empire related to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]]; the violence threatened German citizens living there. The squadron, again under the command of Batsch, steamed to the ports of [[Haifa]] and [[Jaffa]] in July 1877, but found no significant tensions ashore. Batsch then departed and cruised the Mediterranean for the remainder of the summer, returning to Germany in October.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=122}} The newly commissioned {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1874|2}} and {{SMS|Grosser Kurfürst|1875|2}}, sister ships of ''Preussen'', replaced ''Deutschland'' and ''Kaiser'' in the 1878 maneuvers, during which ''Grosser Kurfürst'' was accidentally rammed and sank with great loss of life.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=124}} ''Deutschland'' and her sister ''Kaiser'' remained in reserve for the next six years. They were reactivated in the spring of 1883 for the summer maneuvers under the command of [[Wilhelm von Wickede]]. Due to their long period out of service, their engines proved troublesome during the training cruise.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=161}} Indeed, the maneuvers were temporarily put on hold when the steam plants in ''Deutschland'', ''Kaiser'', and ''Kronprinz'' broke down.{{sfn|Gottschall|p=98}} Regardless, the 1883 cruise was the first year the German navy completely abandoned the use of sails on its large ironclads. ''Deutschland'' went into reserve during the 1884 maneuvers, which were conducted by a homogenous squadron composed of the four {{sclass|Sachsen|ironclad|6}}s.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=161}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 116-125-38, Tsingtau, Landungsmanöver von Seesoldaten.jpg|thumb|German [[Seebataillon|marines]] from ''Deutschland'' enlarging the [[Zhan Qiao|long pier]] in Tsingtao; ''Deutschland'' is visible in the distance]]
The ship did not see active duty again until the summer of 1889, when ''Deutschland'' joined the fleet that steamed to Great Britain to celebrate the coronation of Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]]; the ship joined her sister ''Kaiser'' and the turret ships ''Preussen'' and ''Friedrich der Grosse'' in the II Division. The fleet then held training maneuvers in the North Sea under command of Rear Admiral [[Friedrich Hollmann]]. ''Deutschland'' and the rest of the II Division became the training squadron for the fleet in 1889–1890, the first year the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] maintained a year-round ironclad force. The squadron escorted Wilhelm II's imperial yacht to the Mediterranean; the voyage included state visits to Italy and the Ottoman Empire. The squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April 1890, when it returned to Germany.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=179}} ''Deutschland'' participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of [[Helgoland]] from British to German control in the summer of 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading [[Kiel]]. The II Division, including ''Deutschland'', served as the training squadron in the winter of 1890–1891. The squadron again cruised the Mediterranean, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Wilhelm Schröder]].{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=192}}

During the winter of 1892–1893, ''Deutschland'' participated in a training squadron alongside the old ironclad {{SMS|König Wilhelm||2}} and the new [[coastal defense ship]]s {{SMS|Siegfried||2}} and {{SMS|Beowulf||2}}. The squadron carried over for the fleet maneuvers during the summer of 1893, when they were joined by the four ''Sachsen''-class vessels.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=195}} In November 1893, the ''Deutschland'', ''König Wilhelm'', and ''Friedrich der Grosse'' were joined by the brand-new [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{SMS|Brandenburg||2}}, under the command of [[Otto von Diederichs]]. The squadron participated in the fall maneuvers in 1894, which simulated a two-front war against France and Russia; ''Deutschland''{{'}}s squadron acted as the Russian fleet during the exercises.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=196}} Between 1894 and 1897, ''Deutschland'' was rebuilt in the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Wilhelmshaven]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=6}} The ship was converted into an [[armored cruiser]]; her heavy guns were removed and replaced with lighter weapons,{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=190}} including eight {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} and eight {{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} guns. Her entire rigging equipment was removed and two heavy military masts were installed in place of the rigging.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=245}} Despite the modernization, she remained quite slow. ''Kaiser'' and the old ironclad ''König Wilhelm'' were similarly converted.{{sfn|Sondhaus ''Weltpolitik''|p=190}} ''Deutschland'' rejoined the fleet on 25 January 1897.{{sfn|Gröner|p=7}}

[[File:Deutschland as armored cruiser.png|thumb|left|''Deutschland'' as an armored cruiser]]
Following Diederichs's [[Kiautschou Bay concession|seizure of Kiautschou Bay]] in November 1897, ''Deutschland'', the [[protected cruiser]] {{SMS|Kaiserin Augusta||2}}, and the [[light cruiser]]s {{SMS|Gefion||2}} and {{SMS|Cormoran|1892|2}} reinforced the East Asia Cruiser Division. The arrival of the four ships allowed the division to be expanded to the [[German East Asia Squadron|East Asia Squadron]].{{sfn|Gottschall|p=165}} [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862–1929)|Prince Heinrich]], with his flag aboard ''Deutschland'', departed Germany in December 1897 with ''Gefion''; the two ships arrived in [[Hong Kong]] in March 1898. Prince Heinrich took the two ships on a tour of Asia, culminating in a state visit to [[Peking]] in April.{{sfn|Gottschall|pp=178–179}} While most of the Squadron went to the Philippines to safeguard German interests during the [[Spanish–American War]] in the summer of 1898, ''Deutschland'', ''Gefion'', and {{SMS|Irene||2}} remained in Chinese waters.{{sfn|Gottschall|p=218}} On 14 April 1899, Diederichs left the East Asia Squadron; command passed to Prince Henry and ''Deutschland'' became the Squadron [[flagship]].{{sfn|Gottschall|p=222}}

''Deutschland'' remained on the East Asia station until 1900. After returning to Germany, ''Deutschland'' was used as a harbor ship, starting on 3 May 1904. She was renamed ''Jupiter'' on 22 November of that year. On 21 May 1906, the ship was stricken from the [[naval register]] and used briefly as a target ship in 1907. The Kaiserliche Marine sold the ship in 1908 for 120,000&amp;nbsp;marks; she was broken up for scrap the following year in Hamburg-Moorburg.{{sfn|Gröner|p=7}}
