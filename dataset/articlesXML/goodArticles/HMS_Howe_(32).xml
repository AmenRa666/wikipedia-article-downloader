'''HMS ''Howe''''' ([[pennant number]] 32) was the last of the five British [[King George V-class battleship (1939)|''King George V''-class]] [[battleship]]s of the [[Royal Navy]]. Built by [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]], she was laid down on 1 June 1937 and launched 9 April 1940. She was originally to have been named ''Beatty'' but this was changed to ''Howe'', after [[Admiral]] [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]].  ''Howe'' was completed on 29 August 1942 after her building time was extended, as needed war supplies were diverted to work of a higher priority such as the construction and repair of both merchant ships and escort ships. Like her sister-ship [[HMS Anson (79)|''Anson'']], ''Howe'' would spend most of her career in the Arctic providing cover for Russian convoys.

In 1943 ''Howe'' took part in [[Operation Husky]] and bombarded [[Trapani|Trapani naval base]] and [[Favignana]] in support of the allied invasions. Along with {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}, ''Howe'' escorted two surrendered Italian battleships to [[Alexandria]].  ''Howe'' was also sent to the Pacific and attached to [[British Pacific Fleet|Task Force 113]], where she provided naval bombardments for the Allied landings at [[Okinawa]] on 1 April 1945.

Following the end of the war, ''Howe'' spent four years as flagship of the Training Squadron at [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], before she was placed in reserve in 1950. The battleship was marked for disposal in 1957, sold for scrap in 1958, and completely broken up by 1961.

==Construction==
In the aftermath of the First World War, the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an [[arms race]] developing between Britain, Japan, France, Italy and the United States. This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the [[tonnage]] of all [[capital ships]] at 35,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the [[London Naval Treaty|Treaty of London]], however, by the mid-1930s Japan and Italy had withdrawn from both of these treaties and the British became concerned about a lack of modern battleships within their navy. As a result, the [[Admiralty]] ordered the construction of a new battleship class: the ''King George V'' class. Due to the provisions of both the Washington Naval Treaty and the Treaty of London, both of which were still in effect when the ''King George V''s were being designed, the main armament of the class was limited to the {{convert|14|in|mm|sing=on|0}} guns prescribed under these instruments. They were the only battleships built at that time to adhere to the treaty and even though it soon became apparent to the British that the other signatories to the treaty were ignoring its requirements, it was too late to change the design of the class before they were laid down in 1937.&lt;ref name=K20&gt;Konstam, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The keel of the ''Howe'', the last ship of the ''King George V'' class, was laid on 1 June 1937 at the Fairfield Shipyard in Govan. She was originally to have been named HMS ''Beatty'', after Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]], commander of the British battlecruiser squadron at the [[Battle of Jutland]], but the name was changed to HMS ''Howe'', after Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Howe'' was launched on 9 April 1940 and completed on 20 August 1942. She carried improved [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament and radar equipment as a result of lessons already learned in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;G224&quot;/&gt;

==Design==
{{Main|King George V-class battleship (1939)}}

''Howe'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|39150|LT|MT}} as built and {{convert|44510|LT|MT}} fully loaded. She had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|744|ft|11.5|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|103|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|29|ft|6|in|m|1}}. Her designed [[metacentric height]] was {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m}} at normal load and {{convert|8|ft|1|in|m}} at deep load.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau (2004), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving four propeller shafts. Steam was provided by eight Admiralty 3-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s, which normally delivered {{convert|100000|shp|lk=on}} but could produce {{convert|110000|shp|abbr=on}} at emergency overload.{{#tag:ref|The [[King George V-class battleship (1939)#Machinery|''King George V''-class]] battleships had their steam plant specifications revised during the building phase, and as built the ships actually delivered {{convert|110,000|shp|abbr=on}} at 230 rpm, and were designed for an overload power of {{convert|125,000|shp|abbr=on}}, which was exceeded in service.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts pp. 284, 304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} This gave ''Howe'' a top speed of {{convert|27.62|kn|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=K20/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; The ship carried {{convert|4210|LT|MT|-2}} of fuel oil.&lt;ref name=G253&gt;Garzke p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; She also carried {{convert|183|LT|MT|-2}} of diesel oil, {{convert|262|LT|MT|-2}} of reserve feed water and {{convert|442|LT|MT|-2}} of freshwater.&lt;ref name=G253/&gt; At full speed ''Howe'' had a range of {{convert|2600|nmi}} at {{convert|27|kn}}.&lt;ref name=G254&gt;Garzke p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armament ===
[[File:HMS Howe (32) c1943.jpg|thumb|left|HMS Howe, 1943]]
''Howe'' mounted 10 [[BL 14 inch Mk VII naval gun|BL {{convert|14|in|mm|sing=on|0}} Mk VII guns]]. The 14-inch guns were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets, one forward and one [[aft]]. The guns could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees. Training arcs were: turret &quot;A&quot;, 286 degrees; turret &quot;B&quot;, 270 degrees; turret &quot;Y&quot;, 270 degrees. Training and elevating was done by hydraulic drives, with rates of two and eight degrees per second, respectively. A full gun [[broadside]] weighed {{convert|15950|lb|kg}}, and a [[salvo]] could be fired every 40 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary armament consisted of 16 [[QF 5.25 inch Mark I naval gun|QF {{convert|5.25|in|mm|sing=on}} Mk I guns]] which were mounted in eight twin mounts, weighing 81 tons each.&lt;ref name=G229&gt;Garzke p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum range of the Mk I guns was {{convert|24070|yd|m|abbr=on}} at 45 degrees with HE shell at {{convert|2672|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, the anti-aircraft ceiling was {{convert|49000|ft|m|1}}. The guns could be elevated to 70 degrees and depressed to 5 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The nominal rate of fire was ten to twelve [[rounds per minute]], but in practice the guns could only fire seven to eight rounds per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;G229&quot;/&gt; Upon commissioning, along with her main and secondary batteries, ''Howe'' carried 48 [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2 pdr {{convert|1.575|in|mm|adj=on}} Mk.VIII]] &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft guns and 18 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} Oerlikon]] AA guns &lt;ref name=&quot;Raven and Roberts, p.291&quot;/&gt;

==Operational history==

=== Home Fleet===
[[File:HMSHoweBTurretSydney1944.jpg|left|thumb|''Howe''{{'}}s &quot;B&quot; turret, Sydney, 1944]]

''Howe'' joined the [[Home Fleet]] on 30 August 1942, her building time extended, owing to more urgent demands of the industry. Like her sister ship [[HMS Anson (79)|''Anson'']], she was to spend the early years of her combat career in Arctic waters, covering convoys bound for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Mason&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 1942, ''Howe'' and her sister ship {{HMS|King George V|41|2}} provided distant cover for convoy RA.51, which safely arrived in Loch Ewe on 9 January 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; ''Howe'' and ''King George V'' also provided distant cover for convoy RA.53 on 1 March 1943 and helped to recover merchantmen whose ships had been sunk.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, however, ''Howe'' was transferred to [[Gibraltar]] with ''King George V'' to take part in [[Operation Husky]], the Allied invasion of [[Sicily]]; the US battleships [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|''Alabama'']] and [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] substituted for their absence from the Home Fleet. The two British ships shelled [[Trapani|Trapani naval base]] and [[Favignana]] during 11–12 July. Based in [[Algiers]], the pair also offered cover during [[Operation Avalanche]]-the Allied landings at [[Salerno]]-setting out on 7 September. On 14 September ''Howe'' and ''King George V'' escorted the surrendered Italian battleships [[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|''Vittorio Veneto'']] and [[Italian battleship Italia (1937)|''Italia'']] to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=G224&gt;Garzke p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheneau (2004) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konstam p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of October 1943, ''Howe'' and ''King George V'' had returned to Britain. At the end of year, ''Howe'' underwent a long overhaul at Devonport, where a number of alterations were made. Her anti-aircraft armament was increased, changes were made to her radar, and her watertight integrity in the stern was improved. Modifications were accomplished in the officers and crew quarters for operations in tropical climates; these included changes in insulation, and the extensive use of air-conditioning equipment.&lt;ref name=G224/&gt;&lt;ref name=C16&gt;Chesneau p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pacific operations ===
[[File:HMS Howe (32) at Auckland 1945.jpg|right|thumb|''Howe'' while visiting Auckland, 1945]]

On 8 August 1944, ''Howe'' arrived at [[Trincomalee]] in [[Ceylon]] to join the [[Eastern Fleet]]-she was the first modern British battleship to be deployed in eastern waters since the loss of [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|''Prince of Wales'']] in December 1941. ''Howe'' was put into action quickly, providing cover for carrier based air operations against targets in [[Sumatra]]. In December she moved to [[Sydney]], where she sailed to [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], for a flag-waving visit. In February 1945, ''Howe'' and ''King George V'' sailed from Sydney to begin operations in earnest in the Pacific theatre; together with four carriers, five cruisers and fifteen destroyers, they made up [[British Pacific Fleet|Task Force 113]].&lt;ref name=C16/&gt;

The first major undertaking for Task Force 113 (now redesignated TF.57) was [[Operation Iceberg]]-offshore support for the US landings at [[Okinawa]]-which got under way on 1 April 1945. The force was subjected to sporadic Japanese [[kamikaze]] attacks, but the two ships emerged unscathed from these actions. ''Howe's'' anti-aircraft batteries also succeeded in shooting down an attacking kamikaze plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garzke p. 225&quot;&gt;Garzke p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; The two ships' principal roles were air defence and land bombardment, the latter being carried out very accurately, particularly by ''Howe'' against anti-aircraft installations on the island of [[Miyako Islands|Miyako]], half way between Okinawa and [[Formosa]].&lt;ref name=C16/&gt;

=== Post war ===
[[File:Ships Bell from HMS Howe, in St. Giles Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 989260.jpg|thumb|upright|right|HMS ''Howe''{{'}}s bell in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh]]
By the first week of June 1945, ''Howe'' was back in Sydney, and almost immediately it was decided to send her for a refit in [[Durban]]. It was here that she saw out the remainder of the war. She was relocated back to [[Portsmouth]] by January 1946. In 1951, ''Howe'' was placed in reserve and towed to Devonport. She was ordered to be scrapped in 1957. On 27 May 1958, ''Howe'' was towed to [[Inverkeithing]] to be broken up by [[Thos W Ward]]. The Royal Navy presented the [[ship's bell]] to [[St Giles' Cathedral]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garzke p. 225&quot;/&gt; In 2012, it was reported that parts from one of the gun turrets may still exist, having been re-used as a turntable at [[Dounreay]] nuclear laboratory.&lt;ref name=BBC2012-05-06&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refits ==
