The [[United States Air Force]]'s '''102d Intelligence Wing''' ('''102 IW'''), of the [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]], is a [[military intelligence]] unit located at [[Otis Air National Guard Base]], [[Massachusetts]]. Its primary subordinate operational unit is the [[101st Intelligence Squadron]]. According to the Air Force, the history of the 102d begins with the [[318th Fighter Group]], which was active during World War II. After the war, the 318th was inactivated, and eventually the 102d Fighter Wing was formed, which had a direct lineage link. In 1946, the 102d was activated at [[Logan International Airport]] where it stayed until 1968, when it moved to Otis Air Force Base. Beginning in 1946, the wing began regular patrols of the Northeastern United States which took place in conjunction with Air Force active duty units. In 1968, the 102d was moved to Otis, where it continued its regular patrols until 1973.

During the time that the wing had a flying mission, the wing deployed to many locations around the globe to assist in missions for the Air Force. In 1961, the wing deployed to France during the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]]. Twenty eight years later, the wing deployed to [[Panama]] during [[Operation Coronet Nighthawk]]. It also participated in [[Operation Northern Watch]], helping to patrol the [[Iraqi no-fly zones|No-Fly Zone]] north of the [[36th parallel north|36th parallel]] in Iraq. During the [[11 September attacks]], the 102d Fighter Wing deployed the first Air Force aircraft toward New York City, but they arrived too late to stop the attacks.

Over the years, the wing has controlled many other Air National Guard units. Following the inactivation of the [[67th Fighter Wing]] in November 1950, the wing was put in charge of a few fighter units on the Atlantic Coast. In 1976, the wing even became responsible for the [[147th Fighter Interceptor Group]], located in Texas.

Military downsizing through the [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) process removed the wing's [[F-15C Eagle]]s beginning in 2007, leaving the 102d with an intelligence gathering mission. If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the [[United States Air Force]] [[Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency]], and is one of three Air National Guard wings under this agency. As commonwealth militia units, the units in the 102d Intelligence Wing are not in the normal [[United States Air Force]] chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the [[Massachusetts National Guard]] unless they are federalized by order of the [[President of the United States]].

==Mission==
According to their home page, the 102d's mission is &quot;to provide world wide precision intelligence and command and control, along with trained and experienced airmen for expeditionary combat support and homeland security.&quot; In addition, the website says that their Air Force based mission is in line with the ability of joint force commanders to keep pace with information and incorporate it into a campaign plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.102iw.ang.af.mil/main/welcome.asp|title=102 IW Mission|publisher=102d Intelligence Wing Public Affairs Office|accessdate=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its strictly military role, the wing shares the overall Air National Guard mission of providing assistance during national emergencies such as natural disasters and civil disturbances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission&quot; /&gt;

==History==
The 102d Intelligence Wing traces its roots to the [[318th Fighter Group]]&lt;ref name=318th&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraryautomation.com/nymas/usaaf5.html  |title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II&amp;nbsp;â€“ Part 5 |accessdate=10 August 2008|publisher=Maurer, Maurer |year= 1986 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227040904/http://libraryautomation.com/nymas/usaaf5.html |archivedate = 27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was formed in 1942. It fought in the Pacific as part of bomber escort missions to Japan, and participated in aircraft carrier operations, rarely experienced by the [[Army Air Force]].&lt;ref name=318th/&gt; The 318th returned to the United States after the war, was inactivated on 12 January 1946.&lt;ref name=318th/&gt;

The wartime 318th Fighter Group was re-designated as the '''102d Fighter Group''', and was allotted to the [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]] on 24 May 1946. It was organized at [[Logan Airport]], Boston, and was extended federal recognition on 22 October 1946 by the [[National Guard Bureau]]. The 102d Fighter Group was bestowed the lineage, history, honors, and colors of the 318th Fighter Group.

From October 1946 the 102nd (previously the 69th Fighter Wing) was commanded by General Louis E. Boutwell until his death in July 1947.  From July 1947 until 1956 the 102nd was commanded by Brigadier General Lyle E. Halstead.

===Cold War===

In the post-war era the National Guard Bureau began a major expansion of its air units. Massachusetts was allotted the [[67th Fighter Wing]], which consisted of the [[101st Fighter Squadron]], the [[131st Fighter Squadron]], the [[132nd Fighter Squadron]], the 202nd Air Service Group, 601st Signal Construction Company, 101st Communications Squadron, 101st Air Control Squadron, [[151st Air Control and Warning Group]], [[567th Air Force Band]], 101st Weather Flight and the 1801st Aviation Engineer Company. The 67th Wing was assigned to [[Air Defense Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guard&quot; /&gt;

Guard units were generally neglected when the [[United States Air Force]] was created.&lt;ref name=&quot;guard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenationsfirst.org/air-national-guard-history.html|title=Commonwealth of Massachusetts Military Division, Air National Guard History|last=|first=|date=29 May 2008|website=|publisher=National Guard Museum &amp; Archives|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029022638/http://thenationsfirst.org/air-national-guard-history.html|archive-date=29 October 2016|dead-url=no|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the introduction of jet fighters, the Guard units were left with generally overused World War II propeller aircraft, and had few funds for training.&lt;ref name= guard/&gt; As the Cold War intensified, the Air Force looked to the Guard to fill United States-based interception missions and started overhauling their organization.&lt;ref name= guard/&gt; Although the [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]] wasn't federalized for the [[Korean War]], many airmen volunteered for active duty and flew in [[Korea]].&lt;ref name= guard/&gt; On 1 November 1950, the 67th Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the '''102d Fighter Wing''', including just the 101st and 131st squadrons and their associated support units,&lt;ref name= guard/&gt; and at some point before 1961 the wing was renamed a Tactical Fighter Wing. Additionally, the wing kept the 567th, and the 1801st.&lt;ref name= guard/&gt; The squadrons were issued [[F-84B Thunderjet]]s, but these were recalled and replaced by [[F-51 Mustang]]s which were flown until 1954 when the [[F-94 Starfire]] replaced the Mustangs.&lt;ref name= guard/&gt; In 1952 the [[253rd Combat Communications Group]] was activated and added to the 102d.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; In 1958 the Wing converted to the [[F-86H Sabre]].&lt;ref name= guard/&gt;

From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was commanded by [[Brigadier General]] [[Charles W. Sweeney]], pilot of the [[B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[Bockscar]]'' that dropped the [[Fat Man]] [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]] on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalguard.mil/About-the-Guard/Today-in-Guard-History/August/|title=Today in Guard History (August) History|last=|first=|date=|year=2008|website=|publisher=National Guard|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20161110102734/http://www.nationalguard.mil/About-the-Guard/Today-in-Guard-History/August/|archive-date=10 November 2016|dead-url=no|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, the wing developed from a rather new unit to the mainstay of air defense in the Northeastern United States.&lt;ref name= guard/&gt;

====Berlin Wall Crisis====
[[File:F 86h 52 2116 138tfs phal 0761.jpg|thumb|North American YF-86H-5-NA Sabre of the 138th Tactical Fighter Squadron/102d Tactical Fighter Wing deployed at Phalsbourg&amp;nbsp;â€“ 1962|alt=A jet is seen perpendicular to the camera while parked on the ground]]

On 16 August 1961, when the [[Berlin Wall]] crisis was unfolding, several [[United States Air Force Reserve]] units were notified of their pending recall to active duty. On 1 October the wing and its three squadrons, the 101st, 131st and 138th were placed on active duty at [[Otis Air Force Base]].&lt;ref name= one/&gt;

In late October, the 102d departed Logan for [[Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base]], [[Phalsbourg]], France.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; The wing had 82 Sabres, plus two [[C-47 Skytrain]]s and six [[T-33 Shooting Star]]s for support and training purposes. During the crisis, the wing controlled the 102d Tactical Fighter Group, the [[104th Tactical Fighter Group]], and the [[174th Tactical Fighter Group]] from New York.&lt;ref name=philippe/&gt; The 102d's primary mission was to provide close air support to [[NATO]] ground forces, including the [[Seventh Army (United States)|Seventh Army]],&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; and air interdiction.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; During the blockade, the 102d did not incur any losses.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Starting on 5 December 1961 the 102d began deploying to [[Wheelus Air Base]], Libya for gunnery training.

During its time in Europe, the 102d participated in several [[United States Air Force]] and [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] exercises, including a deployment to [[Leck Air Base]], West Germany near the Danish border. At Leck, ground and support crews from both countries exchanged duties, learning how to perform aircraft maintenance and operational support tasks.

The 102d returned to the United States in August 1962.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Regular Air Force personnel and a group of Air National Guard personnel who volunteered to remain on active duty formed the [[480th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] of the newly activated [[366th Tactical Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Globalsecurity390th&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/390fs.htm|title=390th Fighter Squadron|date=26 April 2005|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relocation to Otis====

In 1968, the 102d Tactical Fighter Wing moved to [[Otis Air Force Base]], and was reassigned from the [[Air Defense Command]] to the [[Tactical Air Command]] the next year. The wing flew the [[F-84F Thunderstreak]] from 1964 until June 1971, when a squadron of [[F-100D Super Sabres]] was transferred directly from units fighting the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;philippe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippecolin.net/102ndFW.html|title=The 102d Fighter Wing|last=|first=|date=22 January 2008|website=|publisher=Philippe Colin|accessdate=29 May 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080827210002/http://www.philippecolin.net/102ndFW.html|archivedate=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were superseded soon after by the [[Mach 2]] [[F-106 Delta Darts]] and on 10 June 1972, the unit became the '''102d Air Defense Wing'''.&lt;ref name=philippe/&gt; On 30 December 1973, Otis Air Force Base was inactivated and transferred to the [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]] as [[Otis Air National Guard Base]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Factsheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Otis Air National Guard Base and the Massachusetts Military Reservation|url=http://www.102iw.ang.af.mil/resources/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=13153|publisher=102d Intelligence Wing Public Affairs Office|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wing intercepted [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Tupolev Tu-95 Bear]] bombers on many occasions, the first of which occurred off [[Long Island]] on 25 April 1975.&lt;ref name=Winghistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.102iw.ang.af.mil/resources/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=13142|title=History of the 102d Intelligence Wing|accessdate=5 May 2010|publisher=United States Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these incidents involved escorting the Bears to [[Cuba]]. The wing occasionally shadowed drug smuggling aircraft, and on one occasion was scrambled to escort an unidentified object, which later turned out to be a weather balloon.&lt;ref name=ghost&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/25/otis_sees_its_last_landing/|title=Otis sees its last landing|accessdate=29 May 2008|publisher=Boston News|date=29 May 2008 | first=Tania | last=Deluzuriaga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the '''102d Fighter Interceptor Group''' was inactivated and reformed as the '''102d Fighter Interceptor Wing'''. It assumed authority for the [[177th Fighter Interceptor Group]] at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base]] and the [[125th Fighter Interceptor Group]] at [[Jacksonville Air National Guard Base]]. Both units flew the F-106. It also assumed command of the [[107th Fighter Interceptor Group]] at [[Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station]] and the [[147th Fighter Interceptor Group]] at [[Ellington Field]], Texas. The latter two flew the [[F-4C Phantom]].&lt;ref name=philippe/&gt;

[[File:Holl-f15a.jpg|F-15 from the [[49th Fighter Wing]] that was transferred to the 102d|right|thumb|alt=A jet sits perpendicular to the camera while parked on a tarmac]]

The 102d Fighter Interceptor Wing lost its F-106s on 5 January 1988. Between January and April 1988, the wing converted to the [[F-15A Eagle]], which it received from the [[5th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] which was inactivating at [[Minot Air Force Base]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Baugher|first=Joe|title=Service of F-15 Eagle with USAF and ANG|url=http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f15_11.html|publisher=Joe Baugher|accessdate=12 December 2010|date=15 April 2000| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101124001707/http://joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f15_11.html| archivedate= 24 November 2010 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then resumed its alert commitment at Otis, and also established a new Detachment 1 at [[Loring Air Force Base]], taking over for the inactivating 5th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. The 102d was the first Air National Guard unit to be equipped with the F-15.&lt;ref name=philippe/&gt;

On 24 January 1989, airmen monitoring the radar at the [[Northeast Air Defense Sector]] at [[Griffiss Air Force Base]] spotted a plane which was not following any known flight plan. The order was then given to &quot;scramble the Eagles,&quot; after repeated attempts to contact the pilot failed. Two jets then took off from Loring to search for the &quot;unknown rider.&quot; The pilots later came across a plane that was blacked out, with no lights on inside or outside. The pilot was a narcotics smuggler from [[Colombia]]'s [[Medellin drug cartel]]. He was carrying had a street value of two hundred million dollars in the amount of 500 kilograms of [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mega&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mega.nu/ampp/drugwar/j91.html |title=The Border Guards-NORAD: The eyes and ears of North America|last=McKenna|first=Pat|publisher=[[United States Air Force]]|accessdate=27 April 2010|location=Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050111014013/http://www.mega.nu/ampp/drugwar/j91.html |archivedate = 11 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Cold War===

====Local defense====
[[File:F-15Cs Massachusetts ANG in flight 2007.jpg|left|thumb|[[F-15]]s from [[Otis Air National Guard Base]]|alt=Two jets fly in formation]]
The wing continued its air defense mission after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1992, the wing deployed eight pilots, five F-15 Eagles, and 48 maintenance and security personnel, for five days training at [[Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay]], [[Labrador, Canada]].&lt;ref name=Factsheet /&gt; The same year, with the reorganization of the Air Force, the wing was reassigned from the disbanding [[Tactical Air Command]] to the newly formed [[Air Combat Command]].&lt;ref name=globalfs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/101fs.htm|title=Global Security History of the 101st Fighter Squadron|accessdate=29 May 2008|publisher=Global Security|date=29 May 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080507000731/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/101fs.htm| archivedate= 7 May 2008 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1993, the wing deployed 50 personnel from the 102d Civil Engineering Squadron under field conditions, to the island of [[Eleuthera]] in the [[Bahamas]]. They helped rebuild schools and municipal facilities damaged by [[Hurricane Andrew]].&lt;ref name=Middleton /&gt;

On 11 February 1993, jets were scrambled to intercept the hijacked [[Lufthansa Flight 592]], which eventually landed at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] without incident. The planes were joined by F-16s from the [[177th Fighter Wing]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The F-15s initially intercepted the aircraft off the coast of eastern Canada. The planes then began to trail the jet at a distance of {{convert|10|mi|adj=on}}. As they approached the airport, the distance decreased to {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}}. The fighters then did a low fly-by as the plane landed. They continued to circle around the airport until they returned to Otis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historycommons&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=otis_air_national_guard_base|title=Profile: Otis Air National Guard Base|year=2010|publisher=Historycommons.org|accessdate=22 April 2010|location=Falmouth, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the 102d received more [[F-15A/B Eagle]]s from the [[32nd Fighter Group]] at [[Soesterberg Air Base]], which was inactivating as part of the post [[Cold War]] draw down of forces in Europe.&lt;ref name=Baugher /&gt;

====Deployments====
Between 1991 and 1995, the 102d deployed to [[Panama]] as part of [[Operation Coronet Nighthawk]], which was a drug interdiction operation. In 1992 the wing became simply the '''102d Fighter Wing''' as part of an Air Force-wide renaming of units.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, B. (2006). ''United States Air Force Unit Designations Since 1978''. {{ISBN|1-85780-197-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wing was deployed from 1995 to 1998 to [[Iceland]] for periodic 45-day deployments. In 1998, the wing's members also trained and deployed to Iceland, Canada, Korea, and Europe. The next year, the 102d participated in [[Operation Northern Watch]] and was deployed to [[Turkey]] in order to enforce the no-fly zone over Iraq north of the 36th Parallel. In 2000, personnel were deployed to the Middle East and Europe in order to participate in [[Operation Southern Watch]].&lt;ref name=Middleton/&gt;

[[File:011106-F-4308R-004.jpg|right|thumb|F-15 over New York City after 9/11|alt=A jet flies over New York City]]

Around 8:30 on the morning of 11 September 2001, the Otis Air Base Operations Center received a call from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s Cape Cod Facility Calls Operations Center that it might be receiving a call from the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]]'s [[Northeast Air Defense Sector]]. The manager of the Cape Cod facility then called the 102d at [[Otis Air National Guard Base]] as they figured &quot;...a call [to Otis Air Base] will be coming from NEADS soon and a scramble order is likely.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Historycommons&quot; /&gt; He called the base because he figured that the pilots would appreciate the heads up. When he called the Otis operations center, the superintendent of aviation management, Mark Rose, answered. He was initially confused by the call as no identification was given. Lieutenant Colonel [[Timothy Duffy]] was then handed the phone and alerted of the situation. On his radio, he called pilot Major [[Daniel Nash (pilot)|Daniel Nash]], the pilot who was sharing alert duty, and told him to get ready for a coming alert call. He also told him to suit up and get ready for a scramble call.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historycommons&quot; /&gt;

Soon after, the commander of the [[101st Fighter Squadron]] phoned the [[Northeast Air Defense Sector]] and asked for permission to launch the fighter jets. The sector in turn responded by ordering the commander of the weapons team which controlled the jets, Major Kevin Naspany, to place the fighters on &quot;battle stations.&quot; This resulted in a warning siren sounding at Otis and the pilots scrambled to their jets. Four to five minutes later, the scramble order was received and the jets took off. Officially, this occurred at 8:46&amp;nbsp;am, with a six-minute difference between the official and unofficial accounts. Duffy radioed his command post for guidance and was told among other things that [[American Airlines Flight 11]] was a [[Boeing 737]], when in reality it was a [[Boeing 767|767]]. Once in the air, their radar kicked in, allowing them to effectively intercept the plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historycommons&quot; /&gt;

Difficulties in accurately locating Flight 11 caused a delay of five minutes, to 8:43&amp;nbsp;am, before the scramble order was given and pilots Duffy and Nash could respond. When Flight 11 hit the North Tower at 8:46, the two jets were still readying for flight and did not take off until 8:52&amp;nbsp;am.

Major Naspany was then asked what to do with the fighters and he responded by saying, &quot;Send 'em to New York City still. Continue! Go! This is what I got. Possible news that a 737 just hit the World Trade Center. This is a real-world...Continue taking the fighters down to the New York City area, JFK [International Airport] area, if you can. Make sure that the FAA clears itâ€”your route all the way through...Let's press with this.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Historycommons&quot; /&gt; Unsure of their target, they were directed to a holding pattern in military-controlled airspace Whiskey 105 off of [[Long Island]] to avoid New York area air traffic. At 9:03&amp;nbsp;am, [[United Airlines Flight 175]] hit the South Tower as the fighters were progressing to their holding position. The [[Northeast Air Defense Sector]] was not advised of this hijacked aircraft until 9:03.

Between 9:09 and 9:13, the jets stayed in a holding pattern. Soon after, they headed toward [[Manhattan]] and arrived at 9:25, where they established a [[Combat air patrol|Combat Air Patrol]] over the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;ntsb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/Flight_%20Path_%20Study_AA11.pdf |title=Flight Path Study&amp;nbsp;â€“ American Airlines Flight 11 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |date=19 February 2002|accessdate=25 May 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080530061803/http://www.ntsb.gov/info/Flight_%20Path_%20Study_AA11.pdf| archivedate= 30 May 2008 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch1.htm |title='We Have Some Planes'   |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=25 May 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080511160550/http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_ch1.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2008 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt; |date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Record&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=9/11 recordings chronicle confusion, delay |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/17/911.transcript/ |date=17 June 2004|publisher=CNN |accessdate=24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While all of this was going on, senior battle staff at [[Otis Air National Guard Base|Otis]] were watching the news when [[United Airlines Flight 175]] crashed into the South Tower. This immediately caused one commander to shout out, &quot;We need to go to battle staff!&quot; This order caused senior commanders to disperse and head towards nearby operations buildings. Inside, the gathered together in the battle cab of the installation operations center. Soon after, a voice came over the base's loudspeakers: &quot;The commander has ordered the 102d core battle staff to assemble. Please report to the operations building immediately.&quot; Mobilization of the wing began to occur after this time. At the time of the order, eighteen planes were ready for flight and commanders began to prepare based on what they anticipated they would be asked to do. Most of these actions were guessing because there had never been an attack on the country before. Knowing that they couldn't await on guidance from the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]], the recalled all training flights and began loading fuel and weapons onto all available fighter jets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historycommons&quot; /&gt;

Meanwhile, at the battle cab, a maintenance squadron officer was told, &quot;Listen, I want you to generate as many airframes [i.e. fighter jets] as you can!&quot; This immediately caused all personnel to be called back and they were ordered to work on the remaining jets. This rush involved the placement of missiles on all jets, including some newer missiles which were rarely pulled out. Six jets which were on a training mission were traversing through the Whiskey Airspace when they were told by the [[Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center]] to head back to Otis immediately. Once landed, the pilots were told to park their jets but leave the engines on. Finally, the first planes took off at 10:20 in the morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historycommons&quot; /&gt;

After a while, an order was received to launch all available fighters. Pilots were briefed on the national emergency and the potential that they might have to take out an aircraft. At this point, someone then ran into the room and said that there had been an order that was received from the [[Northeast Air Defense Sector]] that all available jets must launch. The pilots then ran out to their aircraft with speaker Treacy saying &quot;Go, go, go!&quot; In the haste that the morning had become, not all the jets had been refueled and a majority of the jets were still unarmed. The handful of jets that were armed were sent up with one or two missiles. The standard missile load involves at least two missiles at launch. This is after the handlers had worked at a &quot;furious pace&quot; and &quot;hurried to fix all available jets with live weapons.&quot; Arming of the jets even began fifteen minutes after the South Tower had been hit. this fact would later lend credence to the theory that there was an idea floating around to ram the hijacked planes with a jet. Starting around 10:30 and ending at six that night, all twenty one planes were put into the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historycommons&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2222205.stm|title=US considered 'suicide jet missions'|date=29 August 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 April 2010|location=Falmouth, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial shock of the attacks had passed, questions arose about how the military handled the hijacking and subsequent response with the jets. Some thought that the jets had been purposely kept from flying immediately to New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conspiracy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://my.telegraph.co.uk/jah_wibble/jah_wibble/4546101/Conspiracies/#dsq-content|title='Conspiracies!'|last=|first=|date=7 July 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160307003453/http://my.telegraph.co.uk/jah_wibble/jah_wibble/4546101/Conspiracies/#dsq-content|archive-date=7 March 2016|via=|accessdate=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The questions arising from the response time of the jets come from the practice of [[Cold War]] era policies which prohibited the immediate response to an emergency like a hijacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pentagon Delay&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080101300.html |title= '9/11 Panel Suspected Deception by Pentagon' |date=2 August 2006|work=Washington Post|accessdate=7 November 2008 | first=Dan | last=Eggen}}&lt;/ref&gt; First responder and pilot Daniel Nash said that he could not recall being told that the North Tower was hit but he did remember seeing the smoke over {{convert|70|mi|adj=on}} away.&lt;ref name=Conspiracy/&gt; It is also claimed by conspiracists that the calculations of North American Aerospace Defense Command were incorrect because according to their own calculations, the planes were flying at 24% of their maximum speed.&lt;ref name=Conspiracy/&gt; This statement takes into account the time in which the planes were in a holding pattern over military airspace.

More than 600 wing members were mobilized for [[Operation Noble Eagle]], and the wing began flying around-the-clock [[combat air patrol]] missions immediately thereafter. This continued until February 2002.&lt;ref name=Factsheet/&gt; On 22 December 2001 the wing escorted ''American Airlines Flight 63'' as a direct result of [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]] [[2001 shoe bomb plot|trying to blow up a plane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nationalguardpressrelease&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article-View/Article/573154/air-guard-wing-ends-fighter-mission-embraces-intelligence/|title=Air Guard wing ends fighter mission, embraces intelligence|last=Haskell|first=Bob|date=28 January 2008|website=|publisher=[[National Guard (United States)|The National Guard]]|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20161110104132/http://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article-View/Article/573154/air-guard-wing-ends-fighter-mission-embraces-intelligence/|archive-date=10 November 2016|dead-url=no|accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the buildup to the invasion of Afghanistan, six F-15s and 161 personnel were sent to the [[Persian Gulf]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001/09/20/army-ready.htm|title=U.S. force buildup under way|date=20 September 2001|work=USA Today|accessdate=22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wing also patrolled the skies of the Northeastern United States during this time period. The wing though never deployed for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. The wing converted from the F-15A/B to the F-15C/D in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMARC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarcexperience.com/AMARCArticle102ndFW.asp|title=102d Fighter Wing, Massachusetts ANG|last=|first=|date=16 August 2006|website=|publisher=The AMARC Experience|accessdate=22 November 2008}} &lt;/ref&gt; These planes came from [[Kadena Air Base]].&lt;ref name=philippe/&gt;

====BRAC 2005====
The Base Realignment and Closure 2005 commission originally planned to close [[Otis Air National Guard Base]] and dissolve the 102d.&lt;ref name=globalfw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/102fw.htm|title=Global Security History of the 102d Fighter Wing|accessdate=29 May 2008|publisher=Global Security|date=29 May 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080531145114/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/102fw.htm| archivedate= 31 May 2008 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locals argued that this would leave a huge gap in the national air defenses. Commission officials, after visiting the base, decided to keep it open, but the 102d would still lose its planes, only this time they were only going to the [[104th Fighter Wing]], based at [[Barnes Municipal Airport]].&lt;ref name=ghost/&gt;

In May 2006 it trained with the [[Israeli Air Force]]'s [[115 Squadron (Israel)|115 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dunes&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Raanan|last=Weiss|journal=Air Forces Monthly|title=Dogfighting over the Dunes|issue=269|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wing hosted the [[Cape Cod Air Show &amp; Open House]], its last air show with the [[F-15C Eagle]] at the end of Air Force Week in August 2007. The wing shared a commonality with the [[101st Air Refueling Wing]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Airshow&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capecodairshow2007.org/displays.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120230554/http://www.capecodairshow2007.org/displays.htm |archivedate=20 November 2008|title=''Displays''|year=2007|publisher=capecodairshow2007.org|accessdate=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[103d Fighter Wing]],&lt;ref name=Airshow/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nationalguard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ng.mil/news/theonguard/2007/2007-08.pdf|title=The On Guard|last=Haskell|first=Bob|date=August 2007|publisher=[[United States Air National Guard]]|page=2|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[104th Fighter Wing]],&lt;ref name=Airshow/&gt; which due to commission decisions, also changed the type of planes that they flew. Beginning in 2007, the F-15s began moving to [[Barnes Municipal Airport]]. With the grounding of the [[F-15 Eagles]], the [[158th Fighter Wing]], which is based in [[Vermont]] took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies earlier than expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falcon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforcemag.com/DRArchive/Pages/2007/December%202007/December%2004%202007/1050eagle.aspx|title='A Falcon for an Eagle''|last=|first=|date=14 December 2007|website=|publisher=airforce-magazine.com|archive-date=29 October 2013|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interruption of the F-15's flight, coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the [[104th Fighter Wing]], created some issues.&lt;ref name=Falcon/&gt;

[[File:Otis Air Show 2007.jpg|right|thumb|F-15 From 101st Fighter Squadron during the 2007 Cape Cod Air Show|alt=A jet sits on the tarmac while a crowd surrounds it. People are seen climbing into the jet's cockpit.]]

On 24 January 2008, the 102d Fighter Wing flew its last patrol mission.&lt;ref name=ghost/&gt; The unit's wing commander, Colonel Anthony Schiavi, led the flight, accompanied by Major Daniel Nash, who was one of the first responders for 9/11. Fire trucks were on hand when the team landed a half-hour later, giving the planes and the pilots the customary ceremonial hose-down for the last time.&lt;ref name=ghost/&gt;

====New mission====
When it was announced that the wing would be restructured and [[Otis Air National Guard Base]] would remain open, discussions began about the future of the 102d. Staff of the 102d and those at [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]] headquarters considered a plan centered on the idea that the wing could transition to an intelligence mission to support the growing [[War on Terror]]. The idea hit a roadblock when it was announced that the funds which the wing could use to convert into its new mission had been depleted.&lt;ref name=Limbo&gt;{{cite news|title=New Otis Mission in Limbo|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20070602/NEWS/706020341|newspaper=[[Cape Cod Times]]|accessdate=29 May 2008|date=2 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Governor [[Deval Patrick]] announced that the wing would adopt an intelligence role as soon as the aircraft left.&lt;ref name=&quot;Secure&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20070917/NEWS/709170310|title=Otis Air Base 'Secure'|last=Lehmert|first=Amanda|date=17 September 2007|newspaper=Cape Cod Times|accessdate=25 November 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109214111/http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20070917/NEWS/709170310|archivedate=9 November 2016|deadurl=no|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original Base Realignment and Closure commission plans only hinted at a [[Distributed Common Ground System]] being created at Otis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brac.gov/docs/final/Chap1AirForceFindingsandRecommendations.pdf|title= Department of the Air Force|accessdate=7 November 2008|publisher= [[United States Air Force]]|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans did not include the air guardsmen affected by the loss of their jobs. The issue was resolved when the Air Force announced its plans, right before the F-15s started to leave for Barnes.&lt;ref name=Secure/&gt;

The 102d Fighter Wing was formally re-designated the '''102d Intelligence Wing''' on 6 April 2008 and was planned to reach full operational capacity in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080407/NEWS/804070326|title=A change of the Guard at Otis|accessdate=29 May 2008|publisher=Massachusetts National Guard|date=7 April 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110518095349/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080407/NEWS/804070326|archivedate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the wing had the option of moving with the F-15s to Barnes, but most decided to stay behind and train for new missions. The crash trucks went to Barnes, leaving the [[brush breaker]]s of the [[Massachusetts Military Reservation]] behind. The buildings formerly occupied by the fighter wing, including the hangars, will be occupied by the intelligence mission.&lt;ref name=Limbo/&gt;

On 6 November 2009, ground was broken on new facilities for the 102d Intelligence Wing. The building will eventually replace the temporary facilities that the wing is now operating in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091107/NEWS/911070331|title=Mission breakthrough at Otis|last=Brennan|first=George|date=7 November 2009|newspaper=[[Cape Cod Times]]|accessdate=20 November 2009|location=Otis Air National Guard Base| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091109080110/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091107/NEWS/911070331| archivedate= 9 November 2009 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
