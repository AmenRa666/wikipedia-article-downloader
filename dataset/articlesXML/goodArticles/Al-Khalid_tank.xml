An evolution of Chinese and Soviet tanks, the design is considerably smaller and lighter than most Western main battle tanks. It is based on the Chinese Type 90-II, which combined technologies from several Soviet and Western tanks.&lt;ref name=CiarAK/&gt; The Al-Khalid is unusual in that it was designed to be adaptable for manufacture, so that it can be easily integrated with a variety of foreign engines and transmissions. The current production variant of the Al-Khalid uses a diesel engine and transmission supplied by the KMDB design bureau of [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ukraine&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.ria.ru/business/20130218/179551243.html |title=Ukraine to Deliver 110 Battle Tank Engines to Pakistan |agency=RIA Novosti |date=18 February 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh6hHW3r?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.ria.ru%2Fbusiness%2F20130218%2F179551243.html |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first production models entered service with the Pakistan Army in 2001.

Pakistan plans start the production of next generation [[Al-Hyder tank]] (Main Battle Tank 3000) after the completion of orders for Al-Khalid MBT. The country placed an order with Ukraine's Engine design bureau to further upgrade the tanks with a new engine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janes.com/article/65742/ukraine-to-provide-engines-for-pakistan-s-improved-al-khalid-mbt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In the 1970s, the leaders of China's [[People's Liberation Army]] were concerned about the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat, and requested an improved main battle tank (MBT) to replace the old and obsolete [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] tank. Thus in 1980, [[Norinco]] was formed, and the Inner Mongolia First Machine Group Corporation was tasked with developing a series of new tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norinco.com/ |title=Norinco |publisher=Norinco.com |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint development deal was signed with Pakistan in January 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;paktribune&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.paktribune.com/news/print.php?id=183554|title=Al Khalid MBT-2000 / Type 2000 Main Battle Tank|date=9 July 2007|publisher=PakTribune.com|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial Chinese-built prototypes were tested in Pakistan in August 1991. Pakistan completed its manufacturing plant at Taxila in 1992. Pakistan spent more than [[United States dollar|US$]]20 million over the next eight years on the co-development of a model suitable for its needs and on creating a capability to manufacture it locally.&lt;ref name=&quot;paktribune&quot; /&gt; The Director General of [[Heavy Industries Taxila|Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT)]] Lt Gen [[Hamid Javaid]] and [[Major General]] Muhammad Asad supervised the project. The design team modified the tank to accept a foreign-built engine. Several different prototypes were evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rupeenews.com/2008/02/pakistans-500-al-khalid-tanks-have-beeen-in-production-since-2001-newer-generational-tanks-now-being-exported-via-ideas-2008/ |title=Pakistan's 500 Al-Khalid tanks have been in production since 2001: Newer generational tanks now being exported via IDEAS 2008 |publisher=Rupee News |date= |accessdate=24 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317133453/http://rupeenews.com/2008/02/pakistans-500-al-khalid-tanks-have-beeen-in-production-since-2001-newer-generational-tanks-now-being-exported-via-ideas-2008/ |archivedate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of high ambient temperatures and the fine sand or dust that would be encountered in operational areas such as the deserts of southern Pakistan, the development of high performance cooling and air filtering systems was emphasised during the planning stage of the project. Implementation of a hydro-gas suspension system was considered but, after technical evaluation, it was found to be impractical due to various limitations such as problems with reliability and maintainability. Installation of the [[Renk|Renk 304]] transmission was also considered but disregarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;dj1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/nov/mbt-2000.htm |title=Development of MBT-2000 (Al-Khalid) |date=November 2000 |publisher=DefenceJournal.com |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh6dSwWp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defencejournal.com%2F2000%2Fnov%2Fmbt-2000.htm |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early version was armed with a Chinese gun and [[fire-control system]], and had a German-designed [[MTU Friedrichshafen|MTU]]-396 diesel engine which was built under licence in China. Another version was equipped with a more advanced Western digital fire-control system and powered by a Perkins {{convert|1200|hp|abbr=on}} Condor diesel engine (as in the British [[Challenger 1 tank|Challenger]]) and SESM ESM500 [[automatic transmission]] (as in the French [[Leclerc]]). This version was considered too expensive, and under-performed in the extreme heat of southern Pakistan. Finally, a version was tested with the compact Ukrainian 6TD-2 1,200&amp;nbsp;hp diesel engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ukraine&quot;/&gt; This configuration was chosen by Pakistan for the production version of the tank and came to be known as Al-Khalid. Ukraine also sold [[T-80UD]] tanks to Pakistan, which were powered by a similar engine.

The final tank design resulting from a decade of co-operative development was designated ''Type 90-IIM''. The Chinese company Norinco showed the new Type 90-IIM during the March 2001 Abu Dhabi Defense Expo, under the export name ''MBT 2000''. The version powered by the Ukrainian engine, intended for domestic production in Pakistan, was named ''Al-Khalid''.&lt;ref name=&quot;military-today2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=ARG |url=http://www.military-today.com/tanks/type_90_II.htm |title=Type 90-II Main Battle Tank |publisher=Military-Today.com |accessdate=23 June 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh6wJzEg?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.military-today.com%2Ftanks%2Ftype_90_II.htm |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the development period, [[Heavy Industries Taxila]] gained experience after building the [[Type 85-IIAP]] under Chinese licence and prepared to begin production of the Al-Khalid tank in 1999. A pilot batch of fifteen tanks was inducted into the 31st Cavalry Regiment of Pakistan’s Armoured Corps on 20 July 2001. Pakistan signed a contract with Ukraine's [[Malyshev Factory]] in May 2002 for the delivery of 315 [[Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau|KMDB 6TD-2]] diesel engines over three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pakistandefence&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanidefence.com/news/MonthlyNewsArchive/2002/April2002.htm |title=Pakistan's, $150 Million Contract Signed With Ukraine |date=April 2002 |publisher=PakistanDefence.com |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh763BUc?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pakistanidefence.com%2Fnews%2FMonthlyNewsArchive%2F2002%2FApril2002.htm |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional batch of Al-Khalid tanks was delivered on 23 September 2004. Pakistan planned to build a total of 600 Al-Khalid tanks for its [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;globalsecurity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/mbt-2000.htm|title=Al Khalid MBT-2000 / Type 2000 Main Battle Tank|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104171710/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/mbt-2000.htm | archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a US-based market and special research organisation reported findings showing that the Al-Khalid, along with two other MBTs, would account for nearly 45% of all new MBTs built until 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;fi&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.forecastinternational.com/press/release.cfm?article=89 |title=Main Battle Tank Rolls On as a Dominan Battlefield and Market Force |date=1 March 2006 |publisher=Forecast International |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh7GVkFQ?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forecastinternational.com%2Fpress%2Frelease.cfm%3Farticle%3D89 |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, it was reported that Malaysia was considering purchasing the Al-Khalid after evaluation by Malaysian military personnel, but Malaysia eventually backed out without stating any reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciar.org/ttk/mbt/mbt/mbt.pakistan.al-khalid.malaysia-purchase.2002-05-15.html |title=Malaysia May Purchase Pakistani Tanks &quot;Al-Khalid&quot;, in Construction of Which Ukraine Participates |publisher=Ciar.org |accessdate=21 September 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh7IxKHP?url=http%3A%2F%2Fciar.org%2Fttk%2Fmbt%2Fmbt%2Fmbt.pakistan.al-khalid.malaysia-purchase.2002-05-15.html |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saudi Arabian Army]] began conducting trials of the Al-Khalid's desert performance in April 2006, after expressing interest in purchasing a batch of the tanks 2 years earlier. No order for the tank was placed despite the symbolic naming of the tank after [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;janes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;idex&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idexnews.com/News.asp/id/810|title=Pakistani tank for Saudi Arabia|publisher=IdexNews.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816082146/http://www.idexnews.com/News.asp/id/810|archivedate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, Lt. Gen [[Sarath Fonseka]] of the [[Sri Lanka Army]] held talks with his Pakistan Army counterparts regarding the sale of military equipment, weapons and ammunition. The supply of 22 [[Al-Khalid]] [[main battle tank|MBTs]] to the Sri Lanka Army was reportedly finalised during these talks in a deal worth over US$100 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;indianexpress1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/pak-played-key-role-in-lankas-victory-over-tamil-tigers/467482/ |title=Pak played key role in Lanka's victory over Tamil Tigers |work=The Indian Express |date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh7P6suD?url=http%3A%2F%2Farchive.indianexpress.com%2Fnews%2Fpak-played-key-role-in-lankas-victory-over-tamil-tigers%2F467482%2F |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unveiling==

Al-Khalid was revealed on 17 July 1991, by the then [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif]], along with the then [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Pakistani Chief of Army Staff]], [[Mirza Aslam Beg]], in a ceremony held at the [[Heavy Industries Taxila|Heavy Rebuild Factory (HRF)]], [[Taxila]]. In his speech, the Prime Minister said that the completion of the project was a big step towards self-reliance. The Army Chief said that for the first time in history, not only had technology been transferred to Pakistan, but the design was also made by Pakistani engineers themselves.&lt;ref name=Encyclopaedia&gt;{{cite book|title=Pakistan Chronicle|year=2010|publisher=Wirsa Publications|location=94/1, 26th St., Ph. 6, D.H.A., Karachi|isbn=9789699454004|page=688|author=Aqeel Abbas Jafari|edition=1st|language=Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Al-Khalid.jpg|thumbnail|right|Al-Khalid]]

===Armament===
Al-Khalid is designed with a 125&amp;nbsp;mm bore, 48 calibre long [[smoothbore]], auto-frettaged and chrome-plated gun barrel which is manufactured from highly stiff electroslag remelting steel. The gun is then put under stringent quality control process to ensure standard barrel life of 1,100 rounds EFC; barrels that cannot pass this test are rejected. This gun provides very high internal chamber pressures for APFSDS, HEAT FS and guided missiles. The gun can also fire the following types of conventional ammunition: [[Kinetic energy penetrator|APFSDS]], [[HEAT-FS]] and [[HE-FS]]. The gun is a modified variant of both the ZPT-98 and KBA-3 series of 125&amp;nbsp;mm smooth bore gun for Al-Khalid MBT which provided compatibility with Ukrainian ATGMs such as Kombat. The gun retains qualities of both Chinese and Ukrainians mated with indigenous design for better and accurate firepower on stationary and moving targets alike. The Gun-launched, laser-guided [[anti-tank guided missile]]s can also be launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Cast |place=RU |url=http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/2-2001/ff/atdjm/?form=print |title=MDB |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh7bO9xg?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmdb.cast.ru%2Fmdb%2F2-2001%2Fff%2Fatdjm%2F%3Fform%3Dprint |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iasc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategycenter.net/research/pubID.48/pub_detail.asp |title=Report On the International Defense Exhibition and Seminar (IDEAS) |date=29 October 2004 |author=Richard Fisher Jr |publisher=International Assessment and Strategy Center |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh7e9e9V?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.strategycenter.net%2Fresearch%2FpubID.48%2Fpub_detail.asp |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Khalid also fires a Pakistani [[depleted uranium]] round, the Naiza 125&amp;nbsp;mm DU round which gives an armour penetration of 570&amp;nbsp;mm RHA at 2&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_4.shtml |title=IDEAS 2002 Defence Expo Report |publisher=ACIG |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh7g2h09?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acig.org%2Fartman%2Fpublish%2Farticle_4.shtml |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is equipped with a muzzle reference system and dual-axis stabilisation system.&lt;ref name = &quot;HITMBT&quot; /&gt; Elevation and azimuth control is achieved by electro-hydraulic power drives. The automatic ammunition-handling system for the main gun has a 24-round ready-to-fire magazine and can load and fire at a rate of eight rounds per minute.&lt;ref name = &quot;HITMBT&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.depo.org.pk/index.php?id=7&amp;a=org_prod_listings&amp;pid=43&amp;product=Armoured%20Fighting%20Vehicles%20and%20Upgrades | publisher = Depo | place = PK | title = Heavy Industries Taxila | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219193339/http://www.depo.org.pk/index.php?id=7&amp;a=org_prod_listings&amp;pid=43&amp;product=Armoured%20Fighting%20Vehicles%20and%20Upgrades | archivedate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tank is also equipped with a 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm-coaxial machine gun, a 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm externally mounted air-defence machine gun that can be aimed and fired from within the tank, and smoke grenade launchers.

The gunner is provided with a dual-magnification day sight and the commander with a panoramic sight for all-around independent surveillance. Both sights are dual-axis image stabilised and have independent laser range-finders. The tank has hunter-killer capability, giving the commander the ability to acquire new targets independently while the gunner is engaging another target. The automatic target-tracking system is designed to work when tank and target are both moving. [[Night vision]] for the gunner and commander is achieved through a dual-magnification [[Thermography|thermal imaging]] sight. Both sights are integrated with the fire-control system.&lt;ref name=&quot;HITMBT&quot; /&gt;  The production Al-Khalid tank has a fire-control system of western origin. In the MBT 2000, the Chinese Norinco fire-control system takes inputs from ten sensors.  The ballistic computation time is less than one second. The manufacturer claims routine first round hits on standard {{convert |8|ft|m|abbr=on}} square targets at ranges over 2,000 metres.&lt;ref name=&quot;dj1&quot; /&gt;

* Effective range: 200 to 7,000 metres
* Sensor: laser ranging from 200 to 9,990 metres
* French Auto-tracking, interfaced with gunner station, firing four types of munitions, gunner's thermal imaging sight, commander's image intensification night vision sight, gyro-stabilised and UPS power supply system.

Prototypes were demonstrated with various fire-control systems of Chinese and western origin, but the production model Al-Khalid MBTs use a Western fire-control system (FCS) and gun control system (GCS).&lt;ref name=&quot;dj1&quot; /&gt;

The tank is equipped with the &quot;Integrated Battlefield Management System&quot; (IBMS), named &quot;Rebar&quot;, a digital communications system developed domestically by HIT and CARE (Centre for Advanced Research in Engineering).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Care |url=http://www.carepvtltd.com/products/products.htm |title=Products |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh7lcxSv?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carepvtltd.com%2Fproducts%2Fproducts.htm |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises a flat-screen display mounted inside the tank which communicates with those of other vehicles, including command posts such as the [[Sakb|HIT Sakb]].  It uses a [[data-link]] to facilitate secure communication of battlefield information between units, including tank video footage and information from [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;iasc&quot; /&gt;

A project to manufacture the first Pakistani tank gun barrel was started by Pakistan's Strategic Plans Division (SPD) in 2000. In April 2011, it was reported that the first Pakistani-produced tank gun barrel was ready to be delivered to HIT for installation on the Al-Khalid and [[Al-Zarrar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/621771/locally-produced-gun-delivered-to-hit-for-tanks |title=Locally-produced gun delivered to HIT for tanks &amp;#124; DAWN.COM |work=Dawn |location=Pakistan |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh85YHep?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dawn.com%2Fnews%2F621771%2Flocally-produced-gun-delivered-to-hit-for-tanks |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, HIT imported 125&amp;nbsp;mm gun barrel blanks from France for the two tanks which would then be machined in Pakistan by HIT. The first Pakistani gun barrel blank was produced at Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC) in a joint project involving HIT, People's Steel Mills Limited (PSML) and other defence-related organisations.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; The specialist grade steel was produced at PSML and the resulting steel block was passed on to HMC. HMC then pressed the block to a length of 5 metres and square cross-section, before forging it into a 125&amp;nbsp;mm smoothbore barrel. The barrel was then heat treated several times in facilities such as a large vertical furnace.  The process took 2–3 months and was watched by experts from other defence-related organisations.  The barrel was to be capable of firing at 4 rounds per minute as well as being compatible with the autoloader and its 24-round magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; According to a HIT official, a joint team proved to the [[Pakistan Army]] that strict standards would be met before the army approved production of a first batch of 50 gun barrels by HMC. The Pakistani gun barrels would likely be installed on upgraded versions of the Al-Khalid which are under development by HIT. A Rs200 million PKR contract has been finalised by HIT for the first 50 barrel batch, which is slightly lower than the barrels imported from France. After production of the first batch of local tank gun barrels in 2011, Heavy Machinery Complex is planning to explore manufacture of artillery guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Daiji World |url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=99597&amp;n_tit=Pakistan+Produces+its+First+Tank+Gun | title= Pakistan Produces its First Tank Gun| accessdate = 3 May 2011 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh8DAQw7 | archivedate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobility===
The production model Al-Khalid is powered by a 6TD-2 liquid-cooled [[diesel engine]], designed by the [[Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau|Kharkiv Morozov Design Bureau (KMDB)]] of [[Ukraine]]. The 6TD-2 is a [[supercharged]] 6-cylinder engine delivering {{convert|1,200|hp|kW}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;morozov1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morozov.com.ua/eng/body/addmotor.php |title=KMDB – Tank Power Pack with 6TD-2 Engine |publisher=Morozov.com.ua |accessdate=20 June 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh8A2kUu?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.morozov.com.ua%2Feng%2Fbody%2Faddmotor.php |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2-stroke]] design, with the pistons arranged horizontally in an [[opposed piston engine|opposed piston configuration]], makes the engine very compact and therefore more suitable for being fitted into relatively small vehicles such as the Al-Khalid MBT.&lt;ref name=&quot;morozov1&quot;/&gt;

The 6TD-2 engine drives a French-designed hydro-mechanical [[automatic transmission]], the SESM ESM500, which is also fitted to the [[Leclerc|Leclerc MBT]]. Capable of manual and fully automatic power-shifting, the transmission has 5 forward and 2 reverse speeds along with a braking system that incorporates carbon friction brakes and a secondary speed-retarding system. Gear changes are controlled by a [[torque converter]] which is made more efficient by addition of an automatic lock-up clutch. There is also a mechanical back-up system for use in emergencies, able to shift 2 gears forward and reverse.&lt;ref name=&quot;morozov1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.uos.ua/produktsiya/bronetehnika/60-tankovie-dizelnie-dvigateli |title=Тhe tank diesel engine |publisher=En.uos.ua |accessdate=20 June 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh8Iqf5B?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.uos.ua%2Fproduktsiya%2Fbronetehnika%2F60-tankovie-dizelnie-dvigateli |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Al-Khalid is fairly lightweight compared to the Western tanks, weighing 46 tonnes compared to the 60 tonne [[M1 Abrams]] and [[Leopard 2]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dj2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/august/armaments.htm |title=Towards Self-reliance in Armaments |date=August 2001 |author=Sardar F.S. Lodi |publisher=DefenceJournal.com |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh6UXsn1?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defencejournal.com%2F2001%2Faugust%2Farmaments.htm |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[power-to-weight ratio]] of 26.66 [[hp/tonne]] gives acceleration from 0 to 32&amp;nbsp;km/h (0 to 20&amp;nbsp;mph) in 10 seconds and a maximum speed of 70&amp;nbsp;km/h, the speed and agility also helping to improve survivability.&lt;ref name=&quot;dj2&quot;/&gt;

A [[Vehicle snorkel|snorkel]] allows the tank to cross water obstacles up to 5 metres deep, after some preparation by the crew. Navigation is assisted by an [[inertial navigation system|inertial navigation system (INS)]] and a [[GPS]] satellite navigation system.

===Protection===
Al-Khalid has modular composite armour and [[explosive reactive armour]], high hardened steel plates over rolled homogeneous layers. The composite armour includes classified elements and NERA inserts. Vehicle also has overpressure nuclear-biological-chemical defence system, an effective thermal smoke generator, internal fire extinguisher and explosion-suppression system. The infrared signature of the tank is reduced by infra-red reflective paint. Al-Khalid 1 is equipped with newly developed indigenous explosive reactive armour AORAK Mk.2, which is not only lightweight, but also more resistant to APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FS rounds. ERA is developed by [[Global Industrial Defence Solutions]] (GIDS) Corporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;janes&quot;/&gt; Al-Khalid is also equipped with an active protection system known as [[Varta (countermeasure system)|VARTA]]. HIT is working on an indigenous APS system for future batches especially for Al-Khalid 2. In tests it has 350mm-450mm vs APFSDS and 450mm-550mm vs HEAT.

An advanced laser detection system from Al Technique Corporation (ATCOP) is present, the ATCOP LTS&amp;nbsp;1 laser threat warning system developed by Institute of Industrial Control Systems. LTS&amp;nbsp;1 consists of a mast-mounted sensor and operator's control box, which includes a display showing threats 360 degrees around the tank. It can detect [[laser rangefinder]]s and [[laser target designator]]s and responds automatically by triggering acoustic alarms, smoke generators and other countermeasure systems. LTS&amp;nbsp;1 can detect laser devices operating in the 0.8 to 1.06&amp;nbsp;µm waveband, has a 360° field of view in azimuth (resolution of 15°) and a field of view in elevation of -15° to +90°. Operating voltage is 12V or 24V DC nominal with power consumption being 8 W nominal. The sensor head is 165&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and 35&amp;nbsp;mm high and the control box is 80 x 130 x 55&amp;nbsp;mm in size.

Laser Threat Sensor LTS786P is an early warning device which gives audio and visual alarms of threat by sensing a laser beam aimed at it from any direction. The exact location of the threat (incoming beam) is indicated by nine LEDs, covering all directions above the horizon. It has the capability to differentiate between a Laser Range Finder, Laser Target Designator or a Laser Target Tracker Signal. Provision of sensor output signal, interfacing for appropriate countermeasures, is also available. It can be used on stationary or moving objects of any size or shape. The maximum operating range is 10&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIDS195&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gids.com.pk/ta_Backup/prodetail.php?prodid=195 |title=LASER THREAT SENSOR (LTS786P) |publisher=Gids.com.pk |accessdate=21 September 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qh5n4I5o?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gids.com.pk%2Fta_Backup%2Fprodetail.php%3Fprodid%3D195 |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
