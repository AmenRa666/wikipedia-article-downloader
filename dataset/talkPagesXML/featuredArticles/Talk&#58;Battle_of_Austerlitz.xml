There are some myths and stories about the battle included in the article - one of which is: 

&quot;Another story features an unfortunate French soldier running from Cossacks; apparently, the soldier climbed through a chimney trying to hide, but the Cossacks found and killed him anyway.&quot;

Is something missing from this? It seems like a pretty ordinary event from a battle at this time - a guy runs away, tries to hide, gets killed. Ok, it's a chimney - but still it seems a bit pointless [[User:Gardar Rurak|Gardar Rurak]] 00:43, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

I've heard a few legends about the Coalition defeat causing the fervently anti-Bonaparte British PM William Pitt the Younger to die of a broken heart.

The naming should be consistent, It should be Slavkov u Brna(Austerlitz) and Brno(Brünn). First being an official name in Czech and English language. Austerlitz and Brunn is in German. The name of the battle shouldn't be changed as &quot;Battle of Austerlitz&quot; is a common name.
Also the place of the battle should be &quot;Slavkov u Brna, Czech Republic&quot; to conform with contemporary English name for the place. (the same case as for battles which took place in contemporary Germany for instance)
([[User:194.212.194.194|194.212.194.194]] 16:50, 10 August 2007 (UTC))

I second the above comment. It looks absolutely bizarre to me to see all these German place names. It's like seeing an article in English in which the US is referred to as &quot;Die Vereinigten Staten&quot; Does wikipedia have a place naming standard? I don't even see why it should be necessary to include the germanized names at all, except for cases like 'Austerlitz' and 'Brünn'.

== Location distance from Brno ==
I cite from article: &quot;The battle took place at Austerlitz (Slavkov u Brna) about 6.5 km (four miles) east of Brünn (Brno) in Moravia.&quot; If you look at the map, you see the battle took place between Brno and Slavkov. In fact, centers of Brno and Slavkov are more than 20 kms far away (I guess some 28 kms, but I do not remember precisely). As the military actions took place on large area, this characterization (6.5 km from Brno) seems to be very unprecise and perhaps even wrong. --[[User:Ruziklan|Ruziklan]] 21:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

== Just a thought ==
&quot;Napoleon redirected his gunners to fire at the ice. The men drowned in the viciously cold ponds... Many regard this incident as one of Napoleon's cruelest acts in war.&quot;

It's a referenced statement so I'm not disputing it or anything (not sure about the &quot;many&quot; part though, who?)... just found it rather an odd point of view, that drowning fleeing enemies is somehow more cruel than shooting them in the back and leaving them to bleed to death or tearing them apart with shrapnel. One way to look at it is that both drowning and freezing are relatively peaceful ways to go, their bodies would have been releasing endorphins. Not that I'm suggesting it was in any way merciful, just, doesn't really seem more cruel than regular war, just a tad more creative. [[User:121.45.189.3|121.45.189.3]] 15:21, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

Well I guess the cruelty is that all these soldiers on pond were just fleeing the battle trying to save their lives as the battle was basicly over. Interesting is that according to official report of Austrian army only two soldiers drowned there and same states local chronicles ( 3 soldiers ), when the pond was cleaned afterwads they found only horses and cannons.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.100.4.188|82.100.4.188]] ([[User talk:82.100.4.188|talk]]) 18:16, 7 February 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:It could be said that they fought, but if they did, they fought under the name of the Austrians, since the Austrian Emperor was named as also the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Once that name was neglected by the Austrian Emperor after that battle, there was no more head of state, and more importantly no actual nation for him to be emperor over.

: Nah... the usual obsessive anti-French rhetoric pervasive in the US. Historians (i.e. experts of history, not TV anchors) agree that the French lost about 1,300 soldiers. This statistics is not too hard to verify accurately, since the Napoleon army was thoroughly organized and rosters of the troops were kept updated. It could be that another 8,000 guys died in the following years after being wounded in battle, but that's irrelevant. If a 45 year old ex-soldier dies of alcoholism 20 years after the end of the war, the same alcoholism he acquired while serving in the army, he still should not be counted as a casualty.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.45.191.193|75.45.191.193]] ([[User talk:75.45.191.193|talk]]) 05:02, 24 July 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Official French army report says 1389 dead and 7260 wounded soldiers that is in total loss of 8649 (as among losses are usually counted all dead and wounded), but than French propaganda says only around 1800 wounded, dont forget that history is written by winners so most of the numbers and statistics are coming from French side sometime directly from Napoleon himself. There is legend that one of the French officers asked Wienna citizens why they are preparing so many beds after battle (10000 by order of French army) and he was given reply &quot;these 10000 beds are for your 1800 wounded soldiers&quot;

&quot;The battle was a tactical masterpiece of the same stature as the ancient battles of Gaugamela and Cannae, in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC&quot; - the citation for this doesn't give a page number, and seems to be stating it as fact when I believe that such a statement is the assessment of a certain historian, and likely to be a matter of much debate - therefore shouldn't it read &quot;the battle has been cited by X, Y [et al.] to be a tactical masterpiece of the same stature as the ancient battles of Gaugamela and Cannae, in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.&quot; What is more, the citation is for something called &quot;Encyclopedia of warfare&quot;... is there a better citation or a more renowned historian/source to quote? I didn't want to spoil a FA by sprinkling &quot;attribution needed&quot; tags all over it. Any thoughts? --[[User:SGGH|S.G.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;(GH)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User_talk:SGGH|ping!]]&lt;/sub&gt; 15:00, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

== Sun of Austerlitz ==
If the article is going to refer to the 'legendary Sun of Austerlitz', shouldn't it at least explain what that is and why it's so legendary? --[[Special:Contributions/2.105.139.62|2.105.139.62]] ([[User talk:2.105.139.62|talk]]) 16:01, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

== Four Columns ==
As it's written on the main article the Allies had four columns to attack the French right flank. But when Soult's IV Corps assaulted the Pratzen hights they fought some of the delayed detatchments of the Russian IV Corps and destroyed them. As you let us to understand the IV Corps was the fourth attacking column and after its destruction it is written that the French also enacountered some of the detatchments of the Second Column which forced them to withdraw to the slopes. How is that possible? I mean those Allied forces that forced the French back before they were counter-attacked by Saint-Hilaire's division must be logically detatchments of the THIRD column or I have misunderstood something with their deployment. Can somone give me a specific explanation about this?

== Odd sentence ==
What does &quot;This battle is one of four that Napoleon never awarded a victory title, the others being Marengo, Jena, and Friedland&quot; mean? [[User:Myrvin|Myrvin]] ([[User talk:Myrvin|talk]]) 18:43, 18 June 2015 (UTC)

This [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u_WvcSLuvtwC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=austerlitz+napoleon+victory+title&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ghKDVdjoKISp7AbpooHQCQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=austerlitz%20napoleon%20victory%20title&amp;f=false] says that N gave his marshals titles of many of his other battles, but kept Austerlitz for himself. Not that I understand what that means either. I can't see the other battles mentioned. [[User:Myrvin|Myrvin]] ([[User talk:Myrvin|talk]]) 18:51, 18 June 2015 (UTC)

The article [[victory title]] makes some sense of this. The present article seems to be saying that, for each of his victories apart from the four named ones, he gave a title, based on the battle, to one of his marshals. [[User:Myrvin|Myrvin]] ([[User talk:Myrvin|talk]]) 19:09, 18 June 2015 (UTC)

:From the hundreds of battle Napoleon fought, it's absolutely impossible he just didn't gave titles from these four. And actually the book just said he didn't gave a victory title of Austerlitz, nothing more. [[User:Bertdrunk|Bertdrunk]] ([[User talk:Bertdrunk|talk]]) 00:07, 19 June 2015 (UTC)
::We need to change it then. Do you have access to the cited book? [[User:Myrvin|Myrvin]] ([[User talk:Myrvin|talk]]) 06:34, 19 June 2015 (UTC)
:::No, but I assume it's safe to edit it or change the ref for your book. [[User:Bertdrunk|Bertdrunk]] ([[User talk:Bertdrunk|talk]]) 16:34, 19 June 2015 (UTC)

== Why on earth are Davout's men not counted in the overall number of Frenchmen? ==
It is quite bizarre to not include Davout's III corps in the table especially as they contributed significantly to the battle. The actual number should be 75,000 men as accurately estimated by Robert Goetz in his dedicated military history of the battle of Austerlitz. So why on earth are Davout's men not included in the count?[[User:Parsa1993|Parsa1993]] ([[User talk:Parsa1993|talk]]) 05:26, 18 March 2016 (UTC)

== Dead and wounded ==
Why does it list the Coalition dead and wounded as one big number, &quot;16,000&quot;, but then gives the French dead and wounded separately, &quot;1,305 dead,
6,940 wounded&quot;. 
I gives the impression of smaller numbers then simply writing &quot;8,245 dead and wounded&quot;, which the reader can instantly see is roughly half the number, without having to do mental arithmetic. Giving two numbers, one in the &quot;1,000&quot; range and one in the &quot;6,000&quot; range seems to have a similar effect as writing &quot;$9.99&quot; instead of &quot;$10.00&quot; (a tactic which is proven to work). The only time the total numbers are given is when the captured are included into the count as well, which gives an even greater impression of disparity. Which, undoubtedly there was, I just think it should be as transparent as possible.[[User:AnnaGoFast|AnnaGoFast]] ([[User talk:AnnaGoFast|talk]]) 14:01, 23 June 2016 (UTC)</text>
