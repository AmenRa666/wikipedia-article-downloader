'''Stephen I''', also known as '''King Saint Stephen''' ({{lang-hu|Szent István király}}; {{lang-la|Sanctus Stephanus}}; {{lang-sk|Štefan I. or Štefan Veľký}}; {{circa}} 975 – 15 August 1038 AD), was the last [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians]] between 997 and 1000 or 1001, and the first [[King of Hungary]] from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038. The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in or after 975 in [[Esztergom]]. At his birth, he was given the pagan name '''Vajk'''. The date of his baptism is unknown. He was the only son of Grand Prince [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|Géza]] and his wife, [[Sarolt]], who was descended from the prominent family of the ''[[Gyula (title)|gyulas]]''. Although both of his parents were baptized, Stephen was the first member of [[Árpáds|his family]] to become a devout Christian. He married [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela of Bavaria]], a scion of the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty]].

After succeeding his father in 997, Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative, [[Koppány]], who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors. He defeated Koppány mainly with the assistance of foreign knights, including [[Vecelin]], [[Hont-Pázmány#Notable members of the clan|Hont and Pázmány]], but also with help from native lords. He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by [[Pope Sylvester II]]. In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftains{{mdash}}including the [[Black Hungarians]] and his uncle, [[Gyula III|Gyula the Younger]]{{mdash}}he unified the [[Carpathian Basin]]. He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]], to withdraw from Hungary in 1030.

Stephen established at least one archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries; thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He encouraged the spread of Christianity with severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs. His system of local administration was based on [[Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary|counties]] organized around fortresses and administered by [[Ispán|royal officials]]. Hungary, which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign, became a preferred route for [[pilgrims]] and merchants traveling between [[Western Europe]] and the [[Holy Land]] or [[Constantinople]].

He survived all of his children. He died on 15 August 1038 and was buried in [[Székesfehérvár Basilica|his new basilica]], built in [[Székesfehérvár]] and dedicated to the [[Holy Virgin]]. His death caused civil wars which lasted for decades. He was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory VII]], together with his son, [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]], and Bishop [[Gerard of Csanád]], in 1083. Stephen is a popular saint in Hungary and the neighboring territories. In Hungary, his [[feast day]] (celebrated on 20 August) is also a [[Public holidays in Hungary|public holiday]] commemorating the foundation of the state.

== Early years ({{circa}} 975–997) ==

Stephen's birth date is uncertain because it was not recorded in contemporaneous documents.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=64}} Hungarian and Polish chronicles written centuries later give three different years: 967, 969 and 975.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}} The unanimous testimony of his three late 11th-century or early 12th-century [[hagiographies]] and other Hungarian sources, which state that Stephen was &quot;still an adolescent&quot; in 997,&lt;ref&gt;''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 5), p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; substantiate the reliability of the later year (975).{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=64}}{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}} Stephen's ''[[Life of Saint Stephen, King of Hungary (Vita minor)|Lesser Legend]]'' adds that he was born in [[Esztergom]],{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=64}}{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}}&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Stephen I|url=http://britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/565415/Stephen-I|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|year=2008|accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which implies that he was born after 972 because his father, [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians]], chose Esztergom as royal residence around that year.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=64}} Géza promoted the spread of Christianity among his subjects by force, but never ceased worshipping pagan gods.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=51}}{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=331}} Both his son's ''[[Life of Saint Stephen, King of Hungary (Vita maior)|Greater Legend]]'' and the nearly contemporaneous [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] described Géza as a cruel monarch, suggesting that he was a despot who mercilessly consolidated his authority over the rebellious Hungarian lords.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=331}}{{sfn|Bakay|1999|p=547}}

Hungarian chronicles agree that Stephen's mother was [[Sarolt]], daughter of [[Gyula II|Gyula]], a [[gyula (title)|Hungarian chieftain]] with jurisdiction either in [[Transylvania]] or in the wider region of the confluence of the rivers [[Tisza]] and [[Mureș River|Maros]].{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=44}}{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|p=147}} Many historians{{mdash}}including Pál Engel and [[Gyula Kristó]]{{mdash}}propose that her father was identical with &quot;Gylas&quot;, who had been baptized in [[Constantinople]] around 952 and &quot;remained faithful to Christianity&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''John Skylitzes: A Synopsis of Byzantine History, 811–1057'' (ch. 11.5.), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Byzantine chronicler [[John Skylitzes]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=24}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=28}} However, this identification is not unanimously accepted; historian [[György Györffy]] states that it was not Sarolt's father, but his younger brother, who was baptized in the Byzantine capital.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=44}} In contrast with all Hungarian sources, the ''[[Polish-Hungarian Chronicle]]'' and later [[Poles|Polish]] sources state that Stephen's mother was Adelhaid, an otherwise unknown sister of Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland]], but the reliability of this report is not accepted by modern historians.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=46}}
[[File:Stephen I's birth (Chronicon Pictum 037).jpg|thumbnail|right|alt=Miniature of an illuminated manuscript depicting a birth.|Stephen's birth depicted in the ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'']]
Stephen was born as [[Vajk (given name)|Vajk]],&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=27}} a name derived from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''baj'', meaning &quot;hero&quot;, &quot;master&quot;, &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;rich&quot;.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=78}} Stephen's ''Greater Legend'' narrates that he was baptized by the saintly Bishop [[Adalbert of Prague]],{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=78}} who stayed in Géza's court several times between 983 and 994.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=329}}{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=16}} However, Saint Adalbert's nearly contemporaneous ''Legend'', written by [[Bruno of Querfurt]], does not mention this event.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=78}}{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=329}}{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=16}} Accordingly, the date of Stephen's baptism is unknown: Györffy argues that he was baptized soon after birth,{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=78}} while Kristó proposes that he only received baptism just before his father's death in 997.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=16}}

Stephen's official hagiography, written by Bishop [[Hartvik|Hartvic]] and sanctioned by [[Pope Innocent III]], narrates that he &quot;was fully instructed in the knowledge of the grammatical art&quot; in his childhood.&lt;ref name=Hartvic&gt;''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 4), p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}} This implies that he studied Latin, though some scepticism is warranted as few kings of this era were able to write.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}} His two other late 11th-century hagiographies do not mention any grammatical studies, stating only that he &quot;was brought up by receiving an education appropriate for a little prince&quot;.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}} Kristó says that the latter remark only refers to Stephen's physical training, including his participation in hunts and military actions.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}} According to the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', one of his tutors was a Count Deodatus from [[Kingdom of Italy (imperial)|Italy]], who later founded a monastery in [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]].{{sfn|Györffy|1983|p=132}}

According to Stephen's legends, Grand Prince Géza convoked an assembly of the Hungarian chieftains and warriors when Stephen &quot;ascended to the first stage of adolescence&quot;,&lt;ref name=Hartvic/&gt; at the age of 14 or 15.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|pp=79–80}}{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=17}} Géza nominated Stephen as his successor and all those present took an oath of loyalty to the young prince.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=17}} Györffy also writes, without identifying his source, that Géza appointed his son to rule the &quot;[[Principality of Nitra|Nyitra ducate]]&quot; around that time.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=78}} Slovak historians, including [[Ján Steinhübel]] and Ján Lukačka, accept Györffy's view and propose that Stephen administered Nyitra (now [[Nitra]], Slovakia) from around 995.{{sfn|Steinhübel|2011|p=19}}{{sfn|Lukačka|2011|p=31}}

Géza arranged Stephen's marriage, to [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], daughter of [[Henry the Wrangler]], [[Duke of Bavaria]], in or after 995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Kristó|2001|pp=16–17}} This marriage established the first family link between a Hungarian ruler and a Western European ruling house,{{sfn|Molnár|2001|p=20}} as Gisela was closely related to the [[Ottonian dynasty]] of [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=16}} According to popular tradition preserved in the [[Scheyern Abbey]] in [[Bavaria]], the ceremony took place at the [[Scheyern]] castle and was celebrated by Saint Adalbert.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=17}} Gisela was accompanied to her new home by Bavarian knights, many of whom received land grants from her husband and settled in Hungary,{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=81}} helping to strengthen Stephen's military position.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=18}} Györffy writes that Stephen and his wife &quot;presumably&quot; settled in Nyitra after their marriage.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=81}}

== Reign (997–1038) ==

=== Grand Prince (997–1000) ===
{{see also|Grand Prince of the Hungarians}}
Grand Prince Géza died in 997.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=27}}{{sfn|Lukačka|2011|p=33}} Stephen convoked an assembly at Esztergom where his supporters declared him grand prince.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=83}} Initially, he only controlled the northwestern regions of the [[Carpathian Basin]]; the rest of the territory was still dominated by tribal chieftains.&lt;ref name='Kristó_web'&gt;{{cite web |last = Kristó |first = Gyula |title = Koppány leverése [Koppány's defeat] |work = Szent István király [King Saint Stephen] |publisher =Magyar Elektronikus Könyvtár |year =2001 |url =http://mek.oszk.hu/05000/05000/html/kristo013.html | accessdate =2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen's ascension to the throne was in line with the principle of [[primogeniture]], which prescribed that a father was succeeded by his son.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=18}} On the other hand, it contradicted the traditional idea of [[seniority]], according to which Géza should have been succeeded by the most senior member of the [[Árpád dynasty]], which was [[Koppány]] at that time.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=18}}{{sfn|Kontler|1999|pp=52–53}} Koppány, who held the title Duke of [[Somogy County (former)|Somogy]], had for many years administered the regions of [[Transdanubia]] south of [[Lake Balaton]].{{sfn|Molnár|2001|p=20}}{{sfn|Lukačka|2011|p=33}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=30}}
[[File:Stephen I executing the rebel Koppány (Chronicon Pictum 038).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Koppány's execution|[[Koppány]]'s execution after his defeat by Stephen]]
Koppány proposed to Géza's widow, Sarolt, in accordance with the pagan custom of [[levirate marriage]].{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=83}}{{sfn|Kristó|2001|pp=18–19}}{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=11}} He also announced his claim to the throne.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=83}} Although it is not impossible that Koppány had already been baptized, in 972,{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=83}} most of his supporters were pagans, opponents of the Christianity represented by Stephen and his predominantly German retinue.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=19}} A charter of 1002 for the [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]] writes of a war between &quot;the Germans and the Hungarians&quot; when referring to the armed conflicts between Stephen and Koppány.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|pp=83–84}} Even so, Györffy says that ''Oszlar'' (&quot;[[Alans|Alan]]&quot;), ''Besenyő'' (&quot;[[Pechenegs|Pecheneg]]&quot;), ''Kér'' and other place names, referring to ethnic groups or [[Hungarian tribes]] in Transdanubia around the supposed borders of Koppány's duchy, suggest that significant auxiliary units and groups of Hungarian warriors{{mdash}}who had been settled there by Grand Prince Géza{{mdash}}fought in Stephen's army.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=84}}

Kristó states that the entire conflict between Stephen and Koppány was only a feud between two members of the [[Árpád dynasty]], with no effect on other Hungarian tribal leaders.&lt;ref name='Kristó_web'/&gt; Koppány and his troops invaded the northern regions of Transdanubia, took many of Stephen's forts and plundered his lands.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=19}} Stephen, who according to the ''Illuminated Chronicle'' &quot;was for the first time girded with his sword&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 39.64), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; placed the brothers [[Hont-Pázmány#Notable members of the clan|Hont and Pázmány]] at the head of his own guard and nominated [[Vecelin]] to lead the royal army.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|pp=63, 83}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=39}} The latter was a German knight who had come to Hungary in the reign of Géza.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=63}} Hont and Pázmány were, according to [[Simon of Kéza]]'s ''[[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]]'' and the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', &quot;knights of [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabian]] origin&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Simon of Kéza: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 78.), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; who settled in Hungary either under Géza or in the first years of Stephen's reign.&lt;ref name='Kristó_web'/&gt; On the other hand, Lukačka and other Slovak historians say that Hont and Pázmány were &quot;Slovak&quot; noblemen who had joined Stephen during his rule in Nyitra.{{sfn|Lukačka|2011|pp=32–33}}

Koppány was besieging [[Veszprém]] when he was informed of the arrival of Stephen's army.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=84}} In the ensuing battle, Stephen won a decisive victory over his enemies.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=11}} Koppány was killed on the battlefield.{{sfn|Molnár|2001|p=20}} His body was quartered and its parts were displayed at the gates of the forts of Esztergom, [[Győr]], [[Gyulafehérvár]] (Alba Iulia, [[Romania]]) and Veszprém in order to threaten all of those who were conspiring against the young monarch.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=11}}{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=53}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=85}}

Stephen occupied Koppány's duchy and granted large estates to his own partisans.{{sfn|Lukačka|2011|p=33}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|pp=85–86}} He also prescribed that Koppány's former subjects were to pay [[tithe]]s to the Pannonhalma Archabbey, according to the deed of the foundation of this monastery which has been preserved in a manuscript containing [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]].{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=351}} The same document declares that &quot;there were no other bishoprics and monasteries in Hungary&quot; at that time.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=52}} On the other hand, the nearly contemporary Bishop [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] stated that Stephen &quot;established bishoprics in his kingdom&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicon_193&quot;&gt;''The'' Chronicon ''of Thietmar of Merseburg'' (ch. 29.), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; before being crowned king.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=52}} If the latter report is valid, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Veszprém|dioceses of Veszprém]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Győr|Győr]] are the most probable candidates, according to historian [[Gábor Thoroczkay]].{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|pp=52–54}}

=== Coronation (1000–1001) ===
{{see also|King of Hungary|Coronation of the Hungarian monarch}}
[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|right|alt=St Stephen's modern sculpture in Budapest|King Saint Stephen's modern sculpture in [[Budapest]]]]
By ordering the display of one part of Koppány's quartered corpse in Gyulafehérvár, the seat of his maternal uncle, [[Gyula III|Gyula the Younger]], Stephen asserted his claim to reign all lands dominated by Hungarian lords.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=20}} He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=21}} However, the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}}

Thietmar of Merseburg writes that Stephen received the crown &quot;with the favour and urging&quot;&lt;ref name='Chronicon_193'/&gt; of Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] ([[r.#Historiography|r.]] 996–1002),{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=343}} implying that Stephen accepted the Emperor's suzerainty before his coronation.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} On the other hand, all of Stephen's legends emphasize that he received his crown from [[Pope Sylvester II]] (r. 999–1003).{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Kristó{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=22}} and other historians{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=96}} point out that Pope Sylvester and Emperor Otto were close allies, which implies that both reports are valid: Stephen &quot;received the crown and consecration&quot;&lt;ref name='Chronicon_193'/&gt; from the Pope, but not without the Emperor's consent. Around 75 years after the coronation, [[Pope Gregory VII]] (r. 1075–1085), who claimed suzerainty over Hungary, declared that Stephen had &quot;offered and devotedly surrendered&quot; Hungary &quot;to [[Saint Peter]]&quot; (that is to the [[Holy See]]).{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=343}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=96}}&lt;ref&gt;''Pope Gregory VII's letter to King Solomon of Hungary, claiming suzerainty over that kingdom'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In a contrasting report, Stephen's ''Greater Legend'' states that the King offered Hungary to the [[Virgin Mary]].{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=96}} Modern historians{{mdash}}including Pál Engel, and Miklós Molnár{{mdash}}write that Stephen always asserted his sovereignty and never accepted papal or imperial suzerainty.{{sfn|Molnár|2001|p=20}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} For instance, none of his charters were dated according to the years of the reign of the contemporary emperors, which would have been the case if he had been their vassal.{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}} Furthermore, Stephen declared in the preamble to his ''First Book of Laws'' that he governed his realm &quot;by the will of God&quot;.{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}&lt;ref&gt;''Laws of King Stephen I'' (Stephen I:Preface), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date of Stephen's coronation is unknown.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=22}} According to later Hungarian tradition, he was crowned on the first day of the second millennium, which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=27}}{{sfn|Kristó|2001|pp=22–23}} Details of Stephen's coronation preserved in his ''Greater Legend'' suggest that the ceremony, which took place in Esztergom or [[Székesfehérvár]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubicon.hu/ma_files/2013_06_004-17.pdf Királykoronázások és temetések Székesfehérváron (2013/6)]&lt;/ref&gt; followed the rite of the coronation of the German kings.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=98}} Accordingly, Stephen was [[Anointment|anointed]] with [[chrism|consecrated oil]] during the ceremony.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=98}} Stephen's portrait, preserved on his royal cloak from 1031, shows that his crown, like the Holy Roman Emperor's diadem, was a [[hoop crown]] decorated with [[gemstones]].{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=97}}

Besides his crown, Stephen regarded a spear with a flag as an important symbol of his sovereignty.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=97}} For instance, [[Coinage in the Kingdom of Hungary|his first coins]] bear the inscription LANCEA REGIS (&quot;the king's spear&quot;) and depict an arm holding a spear with flag.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=97}} According to the contemporaneous [[Adémar de Chabannes]], a spear had been given to Stephen's father by Emperor Otto III as a token of Géza's right to &quot;enjoy the most freedom in the possession of his country&quot;.{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=41}} Stephen is styled in various ways{{mdash}}''Ungarorum rex'' (&quot;king of the Hungarians&quot;), ''Pannoniorum rex'' (&quot;king of the Pannonians&quot;) or ''Hungarie rex'' (&quot;king of Hungary&quot;){{mdash}}in his charters.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=343}}

=== Consolidation (1001–{{circa}} 1009) ===
Although Stephen's power did not rely on his coronation,{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=343}} the ceremony granted him the internationally accepted legitimacy of a Christian monarch who ruled his realm &quot;[[by the Grace of God]]&quot;.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=23}} All his legends testify that he established an [[Archdiocese of Esztergom|archbishopric with its see in Esztergom]] shortly after his coronation.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=54}} This act ensured that the Church in Hungary became independent of the prelates of the Holy Roman Empire.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=53}}{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=54}} The earliest reference to an archbishop of Esztergom, named [[Domonkos I, Archbishop of Esztergom|Domokos]], has been preserved in the deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey from 1002.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=54}} According to historian [[Gábor Thoroczkay]], Stephen also established the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kalocsa-Kecskemét|Diocese of Kalocsa]] in 1001.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=58}} Stephen invited foreign priests to Hungary to evangelize his kingdom.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p= 54}} Associates of the late Adalbert of Prague, including [[Radla]] and [[Astrik]], arrived in Hungary in the first years of his reign.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=336}}{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|pp=55–57}} The presence of an unnamed &quot;Archbishop of the Hungarians&quot; at the [[synod]] of 1007 of [[Frankfurt]] and the consecration of an altar in [[Bamberg]] in 1012 by Archbishop Astrik show that Stephen's [[prelate]]s maintained a good relationship with the clergy of the Holy Roman Empire.{{sfn|Bakay|1999|p=547}}

The transformation of Hungary into a Christian state was one of Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=14}} Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects to give up their pagan rituals.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|pp=331, 333}} His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=333}} For example, his ''First Book of Laws'' from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of [[feast day]]s and the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] before death.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=334}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p= 135}} His other laws protected property rights{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=15}} and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p= 135}}

Disturbed on this account Emperor Conrad came upon the Hungarians with a great army.

Stephen's biographer, Hartvic, narrates that the King, whose children died one by one in infancy, &quot;restrained the grief over their death by the solace on account of the love of his surviving son&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 19), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]].{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=48}} However, Emeric was wounded in a hunting accident and died in 1031.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=16}} After the death of his son, the elderly King could never &quot;fully regain his former health&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 45.69), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; according to the ''Illuminated Chronicle''.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=48}} Kristó writes that the picture, which has been preserved in Stephen's legends, of the king keeping the [[vigils]] and washing the feet of paupers, is connected with Stephen's last years, following the death of his son.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=32}}

Emeric's death jeopardized his father's achievements in establishing a Christian state,{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=169}} because Stephen's cousin, [[Vazul]]{{mdash}}who had the strongest claim to succeed him{{mdash}}was suspected of an inclination towards paganism.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|pp=58–59}} According to the ''[[Annales Altahenses|Annals of Altaich]]'' Stephen disregarded his cousin's claim and nominated his sister's son, the Venetian [[Peter Orseolo]], as his heir.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=170}} The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded, and his three sons, [[Levente]], [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew]] and [[Béla I of Hungary|Béla]], were expelled from Hungary.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=170}} Stephen's legends refer to an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king's life by members of his court.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=32}} According to Kristó, the legends refer to a plot in which Vazul participated and his mutilation was a punishment for this act.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=32}} That Vazul's ears were filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources, including the ''Illuminated Chronicle''.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=32}}

In the view of some historians, provisions in Stephen's ''Second Book of Laws'' on the &quot;conspiracy against the king and the kingdom&quot; imply that the book was promulgated after Vazul's unsuccessful plot against Stephen.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=135}}&lt;ref&gt;''Laws of King Stephen I'' (Stephen II:19), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view has not been universally accepted.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=135}} Györffy states that the law book was issued, not after 1031, but around 1009.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=136}} Likewise, the authenticity of the decree on tithes is debated: according to Györffy, it was issued during Stephen's reign, but Berend, Laszlovszky and Szakács argue that it &quot;might be a later addition&quot;.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=351}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=136}}

== Legacy ==

=== Founder of Hungary ===
Stephen has always been considered one of the most important statesmen in the history of Hungary.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=51}} His main achievement was the establishment of a Christian state that ensured that the Hungarians survived in the Carpathian Basin, in contrast to the [[Huns]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and other peoples who had previously controlled the same territory.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=51}} As Bryan Cartledge emphasizes, Stephen also gave his kingdom &quot;forty years of relative peace and sound but unspectacular rule&quot;.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=17}}

His successors, including those descended from Vazul, were eager to emphasize their devotion to Stephen's achievements.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p=106}} Although Vazul's son, [[Andrew I of Hungary]], secured the throne due to a [[Vata pagan uprising|pagan uprising]], he prohibited pagan rites and declared that his subjects should &quot;live in all things according to the law which King St. Stephen had taught them&quot;, according to the 14th-century ''Illuminated Chronicle''.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p=106}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 60.86), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1526)|medieval Hungary]], communities that claimed a privileged status or attempted to preserve their own &quot;[[Privilege (law)|liberties]]&quot; often declared that the origin of their special status was to be attributed to King Saint Stephen.{{sfn|Tringli|2001|p=129}} An example is a 1347 letter from the people of [[Táp]] telling the king about their grievances against the Pannonhalma Archabbey and stating that the taxes levied upon them by the abbot contradicted &quot;the liberty granted to them in the time of King Saint Stephen&quot;.{{sfn|Tringli|2001|p=139}}

Stephen's cult emerged after the long period of anarchy characterizing the rule of his immediate successors.{{sfn|Magyar|1996|p=24}}&lt;ref name='Diós'&gt;{{cite web |last=Diós |first=István |title=Szent István király [King Saint Stephen] |work=A szentek élete [Lives of Saints] |publisher=Szent István Társulat |date= |url=http://www.katolikus.hu/szentek/0820.html |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that Stephen became an object of veneration before his canonization.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=127}} For instance, the first member of the royal family to be named after him, [[Stephen II of Hungary|Stephen II]], was born in the early 12th century.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=129}}

Stephen's canonization was initiated by Vazul's grandson, King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], who had consolidated his authority by capturing and imprisoning his cousin, [[Solomon, King of Hungary|Solomon]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=35}} According to Bishop Hartvic, the canonization was &quot;decreed by apostolic letter, by order of the Roman see&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 24.), p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the ceremony was permitted by Pope Gregory VII.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=125}} The ceremony started at Stephen's tomb, where on 15 August 1083 masses of believers began three days of fasting and praying.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=124}} Legend tells that Stephen's coffin could not be opened until King Ladislaus held Solomon in captivity at [[Visegrád]].{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=124}} The opening of Stephen's tomb was followed by the occurrence of healing miracles, according to Stephen's legends.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=35}} Historian Kristó attributes the healings either to [[Folie à deux|mass psychosis]] or deception.{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=35}} Stephen's legends also say that his &quot;balsam-scented&quot; remains were elevated from the coffin, which was filled with &quot;rose-colored water&quot;, on 20 August.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=124}} On the same day, Stephen's son, Emeric, and the bishop of Csanád, Gerard, were also canonized.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=33}}

{{Quote|Having completed the office of [[Vespers]] the third day, everyone expected the favors of divine mercy through the merit of the blessed man; suddenly with Christ visiting his masses, the signs of miracles poured forth from heaven throughout the whole of the holy house.

Stephen's first legend, the so-called ''Greater Legend'', was written between 1077 and 1083.{{sfn|Berend|2001|p=375}} It provided an idealized portrait of the king,{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=90}} one who dedicated himself and his kingdom to the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Berend|2001|p=375}} However, Stephen's ''Lesser Legend''{{mdash}}composed around 1100,{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=90}} under King [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman]]{{sfn|Berend|2001|p=375}}{{mdash}}emphasized Stephen's severity.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=90}} A third legend, also composed during King Coloman's reign by Bishop Hartvic, was based on the two existing legends.{{sfn|Berend|2001|p=375}} Sanctioned in 1201 by [[Pope Innocent III]], Hartvic's work served as Stephen's official legend.{{sfn|Berend|2001|p=375}} Gábor Klaniczay wrote that Stephen's legends &quot;opened a new chapter in the legends of holy rulers as a genre&quot;, suggesting that a monarch can achieve sainthood through actively using his royal powers.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=136}} Stephen was the first triumphant ''[[Miles Christianus|miles Christi]]'' (&quot;Christ's soldier&quot;) among the canonized monarchs.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=134}} He was also a &quot;[[Confessor of the Faith|confessor king]]&quot;, one who had not suffered martyrdom, whose cult was sanctioned, in contrast with earlier holy monarchs.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=16}}

Stephen's cult spread beyond the borders of Hungary.&lt;ref name='Diós'/&gt; Initially, he was primarily venerated in Scheyern and [[Bamberg]], in Bavaria, but his relics were also taken to [[Aachen]], [[Cologne]], [[Montecassino]] and [[Namur, Belgium|Namur]].&lt;ref name='Diós'/&gt; Upon the liberation of [[Buda]] from the Ottoman Turks, [[Pope Innocent XI]] expanded King Saint Stephen's cult to the entire Roman Catholic Church in 1686,&lt;ref name='Diós'/&gt; and declared 2 September his [[feast day]].{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=160}}&lt;ref name='Diós'/&gt; As the feast of Saint [[Joachim]] was moved, in 1969, from 16 August,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Calendarium Romanum&quot; (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), pp. 98 and 135&lt;/ref&gt; the day immediately following the day of Stephen's death, Stephen's feast was moved to that date.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Calendarium Romanum&quot; (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), pp. 100, 137&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen is venerated as the patron saint of Hungary,&lt;ref name='Diós'/&gt; and regarded as the protector of kings, masons, stonecutters, stonemasons and bricklayers,{{sfn|Guiley|2001|p=314}} and also of children suffering from severe illnesses.{{sfn|Guiley|2001|p=314}} His canonization was recognized by [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]] [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=Uj_Ember&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papp |first=Tamás |title=Az ortodox egyház is szentként tiszteli: Országalapító királyunk és a keleti hagyományok kapcsolatáról [Venerated also by the Orthodox Church: On the connections between our king founding our state and the Oriental traditions] |journal=Új Ember |volume=34–35 |issue=LXI |publisher=Magyar Katolikus Egyház |location=Budapest |date=2005-08-21 |language=Hungarian |url=http://ujember.katolikus.hu/Archivum/2005.08.21/0201.html |issn=1418-1657 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the calendar of the Hungarian Catholic Church, Stephen's feast is observed on 20 August, the day on which his relics were [[translation (relics)|translated]].&lt;ref name='Diós'/&gt; In addition, a separate feast day (30 May) is dedicated to his &quot;Holy Dexter&quot;.&lt;ref name='Diós'/&gt;

=== Holy Dexter ===

Stephen's intact dexter, or right hand ({{lang-hu|Szent Jobb}}), became the subject of a cult.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=33}}{{sfn|Csorba|2004|p=7}} A cleric named Mercurius stole it, but it was discovered on 30 May 1184 in [[Bihar County]].{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=124}} The theft of sacred relics, or ''furta sacra'', had by that time become a popular topic of saints' biographies.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=146}} Bishop Hartvic described the discovery of Stephen's right hand in accordance with this tradition, referring to adventures and visions.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=146}} An abbey erected in Bihar County (now [[Sâniob]], Romania) was named after and dedicated to the veneration of the Holy Dexter.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=33}}

{{Quote|Why is it, brothers, that his other limbs having become disjointed and, his flesh having been reduced to dust, wholly separated, only the right hand, its skin and [[sinews]] adhering to the bones, preserved the beauty of wholeness? I surmise that the inscrutability of divine judgement sought to proclaim by the extraordinary nature of this fact nothing less than that the work of love and alms surpasses the measure of all other virtues.&amp;nbsp;...

The Holy Dexter was kept for centuries in the Szentjobb Abbey, except during the Mongol invasion of 1241 and 1242, when it was transferred to Ragusa (now [[Dubrovnik]], Croatia).{{sfn|Csorba|2004|p=7}} The relic was then taken to Székesfehérvár around 1420.{{sfn|Csorba|2004|p=7}} Following the [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman occupation]] of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary in the mid-16th&amp;nbsp;century, it was guarded in many places, including [[Bosnia]], Ragusa and Vienna.&lt;ref name='Szent_Jobb'&gt;{{cite web |title=A Szent Jobb története [History of the Holy Dexter]  |work=Szent István Bazilika: Történet [St. Stephen's Basilica: History] |publisher=Szent István Bazilika, Budapest |year= 1991 |url=http://www.bazilika.biz/a-szent-jobb-tortenete/a-szent-jobb-tortenete |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was returned to Hungary in 1771, when Queen [[Maria Theresa]] donated it to the cloister of the [[Sisters of Loreto]] in Buda.&lt;ref name='Szent_Jobb'/&gt; It was kept in [[Buda Castle]]'s St. Sigismund Chapel between around 1900 and 1944, in a cave near [[Salzburg]] in 1944 and 1945, and again by the Sisters of Loreto in Buda, between 1945 and 1950. Finally, since 1950, the Holy Dexter has been in [[St. Stephen's Basilica]] in Budapest.&lt;ref name='Szent_Jobb'/&gt; An annual procession celebrating the relic was instituted in 1938, and continued until 1950, when the procession was forbidden by the Communist government.&lt;ref name='Szent_Jobb'/&gt; It was resumed in 1988.&lt;ref name='Szent_Jobb'/&gt;

=== ''Admonitions'' ===
According to Stephen's ''Greater Legend'', the king &quot;himself compiled a book for his son on moral education&quot;.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|pp=166–167}} This work, now known as ''Admonitions'' or ''De institutione morum'',{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=166}} was preserved in manuscripts written in the [[Late Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=343}} Although scholars debate whether it can actually be attributed to the king or a cleric, most of them agree that it was composed in the first decades of the 11th&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=343}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=167}}

The ''Admonitions'' argues that kingship is inseparably connected with the Catholic faith.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=343}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=167}} Its author emphasized that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates, but is entitled to punish clergymen who do wrong.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=343}} One of its basic ideas was that a sovereign has to cooperate with the &quot;pillars of his rule&quot;, meaning the prelates, aristocrats, ''ispáns'' and warriors.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=167}}

{{Quote|My dearest son, if you desire to honor the royal crown, I advise, I counsel, I urge you above all things to maintain the Catholic and Apostolic faith with such diligence and care that you may be an example for all those placed under you by God, and that all the clergy may rightly call you a man of true Christian profession. Failing to do this, you may be sure that you will not be called a Christian or a son of the Church. Indeed, in the royal palace, after the faith itself, the Church holds second place, first constituted and spread through the whole world by His members, the apostles and holy fathers, And though she always produced fresh offspring, nevertheless in certain places she is regarded as ancient. However, dearest son, even now in our kingdom the Church is proclaimed as young and newly planted; and for that reason she needs more prudent and trustworthy guardians lest a benefit which the divine mercy bestowed on us undeservedly should be destroyed and annihilated through your idleness, indolence or neglect.|Stephen's ''Admonitions'' to his son, Emeric{{sfn|O'Malley|1995|pp=46–47}}}}

A popular hymn, still sung in the churches, was first recorded in the late {{nobr|18th century}}.&lt;ref name=Pomogats/&gt; It hails King St. Stephen as &quot;radiant star of Hungarians&quot;.&lt;ref name=Pomogats/&gt; [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] composed his ''[[König Stephan|King Stephen Overture]]'' for the inauguration of the Hungarian theatre in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in 1812.&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{cite web |last=Keller |first=James M. |title=Beethoven: Overture to King Stephen, Opus 117 |publisher=San Francisco Symphony |year=2013 |url=http://www.sfsymphony.org/Watch-Listen-Learn/Read-Program-Notes/Program-Notes/BEETHOVEN-%C2%A0Overture-to-King-Stephen,-Opus-117-%E2%94%82-Ma.aspx |accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to musician James M. Keller, &quot;[t]he descending unisons that open the ''King Stephen Overture'' would seem to prefigure the opening of the ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]''{{nobr|; ...}} [a]nd then a later theme, introduced by flutes and clarinets, seems almost to be a {{nobr|variation ...}} of the famous ''Ode &quot;To Joy&quot;'' melody of the Ninth Symphony's finale&quot;.&lt;ref name=Keller/&gt; Hungarian composer [[Ferenc Erkel]] named his last complete [[opera]] from 1885, ''István király'' (&quot;King Stephen&quot;), after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bóka |first=Gábor |title=István király – a kottától az operáig [King Stephen – from sheet music to the opera] |publisher=Opera-Világ |date=13 August 2013 |url=http://operavilag.net/interjuk/istvan-kiraly-a-kottatol-az-eloadasig/ |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[Zoltán Kodály]] wrote a choral piece titled ''Ének Szent István Királyhoz'' (&quot;Hymn to King Stephen&quot;).&lt;ref name=Breuer&gt;{{cite book|last=Breuer|first=János|title=Kodály-kalauz |year=1982 |publisher=Zeneműkiadó |isbn=0-328-47359-6 |pages=293, 318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1983, [[Levente Szörényi]] and [[János Bródy]] composed a [[rock opera]]—''[[István, a király]]'' (&quot;Stephen, the King&quot;)—about the early years of his reign. Seventeen years later, in 2000, Szörényi composed a sequel called ''Veled, Uram!'' (&quot;You, Sir&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=hu&amp;u=http://vivalamusical.hu/kritikak/veled-uram&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DVeled,%2BUram!%26biw%3D800%26bih%3D403|title=Veled, Uram!
