The '''8th Rifle Division''' was a military [[formation (military)|formation]] of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]] in the [[Winter War]], the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], and [[World War II]]. It was formed three times.

==First Formation 1918–1941==
The division was formed by the executive order of the Moscow district military office and was based on the 5th Moscow Infantry Division, 1st Infantry Division in Tula, 2nd Infantry Division in Tambov and the 5th Infantry Division in [[Kaluga]].

In September 1918 it was named the ''8th Infantry Division''. On 11 October 1918, it was renamed the 8th Rifle Division. The division received a number of awards between the 1920s and 1930s. On 8 December 1921 it was given the name &quot;Minsk.&quot; On 29 February 1928 it was awarded the [[Honorary Revolutionary Red Banner]] on the 10th anniversary of the Red Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rkka.ru/handbook/reg/8sd18.htm|title = 8th Minsk Red Banner Rifle Division|date = |access-date = 21 Jan 2016|website = rkka.ru|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 1926 it was named &quot;Dzerzhinsky,&quot; and in 1932  was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]]. A reference to being 'formed at [[Semipalatinsk]] prior to 1936' in Poirer and Connor's ''Red Army Order of Battle'' remains unconfirmed by Russian sources, suggesting that said rumours are indeed ''false''. The unit's full title appears to have become the 8th Minsk Red Banner Order of Red Banner of Labor Dzerzhinsky Rifle Division.

[[Brigade Commander]] Vladimir Yakovlevich Kolpakchi took command of the unit in 1937. The division took part in the [[Polish Campaign]] as part of the 16th Rifle Corps, [[11th Army (Soviet Union)|11th Army]]. [[Brigade Commander]] Fursin(?) held command from December 1940 (1939?) to 4 February 1940. On 22 January 1940, it was part of the 13th Rifle Corps of the [[Northwestern Front]] during the [[Winter War]], but had been shifted to the 23rd Rifle Corps by 31 January 1940. On 5 February 1940 [[Brigade Commander]] Fedor Dmitrievich Rubtsov took command. On 8 March 1940 it was part of the Northwestern Front's 15th Rifle Corps. On 27 April 1940 [[Colonel]] Nicholas I. Fomin took command from Rubtsov. On 22 June 1941, it was part of the 1st Rifle Corps, [[10th Army (Soviet Union)|10th Army]], itself part of the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]].

Major components at the beginning of [[Operation Barbarossa]] seem to have included the 151st, 229th, and 310th Rifle Regiments, the 62nd Light [[Artillery]] Regiment, the 117th [[Howitzer]] [[Artillery]] Regiment, and the 2nd Reconnaissance Company. During the [[Second World War]] it was part of the 'Operational Army' from 22 June 1941 to 4 July 1941.

The division was stationed at [[Łomża]]. In accordance with the [[Western Special Military District]] covering plan, the division was to take up positions in the Osovetsky Fortified Region and along the 1939 state border with [[German-occupied Poland]] in the areas of Shchuchin, Brzozowo, Ptak, and Servatki.

On the first day of the war the Division [[Headquarters|HQ]] came under aerial bombardment. On 23 June 1941 the Division held the front in the [[Ščučyn]] region as well. On 25 June 1941 the division conduct a withdrawal while the [[Białystok]] and, because the prisoners were rounded up. On 27 June 1941, at the headquarters of the front had no information not only about the division, but also on [[10th Army (Soviet Union)|10th Army]], which included the division.

By 1 July 1941 the division was still part of 1st Rifle Corps, but 1st Rifle Corps had been diverted directly to the Western Front. In early July, the division was destroyed in the [[Białystok]] area, as part of the [[Battle of Białystok–Minsk|German encirclement west of Minsk]]&lt;ref&gt;Craig Crofoot, Armies of the Bear&lt;/ref&gt; but unorganized resistance continued until the end of July. The division was officially disbanded on 19 September 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Second Formation 1941==
The division was ordered to reform in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:ru:8-я стрелковая дивизия (2-го формирования)]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 July 1941 the division reformed in the [[Presnensky District|Krasnopresnensky District]] of [[Moscow]], as the 8th Krasnopresnenskaya [[Peoples' Militia]] Rifle Division under the command of the [[Moscow Military District]]. The division contained an unusually large number of writers, musicians and historians; the writers were put together in the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 24th Rifle Regiment, which became known as the &quot;Writers' Company&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rodric Braithwaite, ''Moscow 1941'', Vintage Books, New York, 2007, p 109&lt;/ref&gt; By 10 July 1941, the regiments of the division had moved to the forest near Nicholas Urupino and Buzlanova. In late July, the division engaged in the fortification of defensive lines on the [[Mozhaysk]] line of defense. From at least 1 August 1941 to its destruction, the division was part of the [[32nd Army (Soviet Union)|32nd Army]], itself part of the [[Reserve Front]]. 
On 4 August 1941 the division took positions on the [[Rzhev]]-[[Vyazma]] line of defence, and from 30 August 1941, in positions on the eastern shore of the [[Dnieper River]] as well. On 24 August 1941 the formation was formally renamed the 8th Rifle Division. It included the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th Rifle Regiments. In October, in connection with the beginning of the German [[Operation Typhoon]] it moved to the east of [[Yelnya]].
The division entered combat on 4 October 1941, the next day, 5 October 1941, losing more than half of its personnel. On 6 October 1941 it was cut off from the main organs of the regiments. Some of the division's surviving fighters were able to join [[Soviet partisans|partisan]] units. While the division was effectively destroyed on 6–7 October 1941 it was not formally disbanded until 30 November 1941.

==Third Formation==
The Third Formation of the 8th Rifle Division traces its origins to the 458th Rifle Division, which was formed in [[Semipalatinsk]] and [[Ayaguz]] in the [[Central Asian Military District]] on 25 December 1941. In early 1942 it was redesignated as the 8th Rifle Division.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:ru:8-я стрелковая дивизия (3-го формирования)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Its rifle regiments, inherited from the original division, were the 151st, 229th, and 310th. Its full name became the 8 Rifle Yampol'skaya Red Banner Order of Suvorov Division, after winning the honorific '[[Yampil, Vinnytsia Oblast|Yampol]]'.
On 1 April 1942 the division was part of the Stavka Reserve. By 1 July 1942 it had been assigned to the [[Bryansk Front]]'s [[42nd Army (Soviet Union)|42nd Army]]. By 1 October it was part of [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|13th Army]], and stayed assigned to that formation On 1 July 1943 it was assigned to the [[Soviet Central Front]]'s [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|13th Army]], as part of the 15th Rifle Corps. It participated in the Voronezh-Kastornoye, [[Eastern Carpathians]], and the [[Prague Offensive|Prague]] offensives, the [[Battle of Kursk]], [[Lower Dnieper Offensive|the crossing of the Dnieper]] and the [[Desna River|Desna]] and [[Pripyat River]]s. It defended [[Mtsensk]], participated in the liberation of [[Kromy]], [[Nevel (town)|Nevel]], [[Novgorod-Seversky]], and [[Chernigov]].
