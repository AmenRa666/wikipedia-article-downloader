'''SS ''Czar''''', or '''''Царь''''' in [[Russian language|Russian]], was an [[ocean liner]] for the [[Russian American Line]] before World War I. The ship was later known as '''''Estonia''''' for the [[Baltic American Line]], '''''Pułaski''''' for the [[Gdynia America Line]] and as a British [[Ministry of War Transport]] troopship, and as '''''Empire Penryn''''' after World War II. The liner was built in [[Glasgow]] for the Russian American Line in 1912 and sailed on North Atlantic routes from [[Liepāja|Libau]] to [[New York City|New York]]. On one eastbound voyage in October 1913, ''Czar'' was one of ten ships that came to the aid of the burning Uranium Line steamer {{SS|Volturno|1906|2}}.

After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the ship came under the control of the [[British Shipping Controller]] and was managed by the [[Thomas Wilson Sons &amp; Co.|Wilson Line]] and later, the [[Cunard Line]]. Under Cunard management in 1918 as HMT&lt;ref group = Note&gt;In this case, ''HMT'' stands for ''His Majesty's Transport''. For other uses as a ship prefix, see [[ship prefix|here]], under the heading of &quot;United Kingdom&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Czar'', she was employed as a troopship carrying United States troops to France as part of the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Cruiser and Transport Force]]. After the end of World War I, the ship was returned to the [[East Asiatic Company]], the parent company of the Russian American Line, who placed her on their Baltic American Line sailing in roundtrip passenger service to New York under the name ''Estonia''. She was sold to the [[Poland|Polish]] Gdynia America Line in 1930, and renamed SS ''Pułaski'' the following year for Polish passenger service to North and South America.

After the outbreak of World War II, ''Pułaski'' was initially used as a French and, after the [[Fall of France]], a British troopship. ''Pułaski'' sailed variously in the North Atlantic, between African ports, and in the Indian Ocean. In 1946, the ship's name was changed to ''Empire Penryn'' and continued trooping duties under the management of [[Lamport &amp; Holt]]. She was scrapped in 1949 at [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]].

== Launching and early career ==
[[Ocean liner]] SS ''Czar'' was launched on 23 March 1912 by [[Barclay Curle &amp; Company]] of [[Glasgow]], Scotland, for the [[Russian American Line]], a subsidiary of the Danish [[East Asiatic Company]]. ''Czar'' had a {{GT|6,503|disp=long}} and measured {{convert|425|ft|m}} long by {{convert|53.2|ft|m}} [[Beam (nautical)|abeam]] and had two [[steamship funnel|funnels]] and two [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s. She was driven by twin [[screw propeller]]s at {{convert|15|knots|km/h}} by two [[steam engine]]s. ''Czar'' had accommodations for 30 passengers in first class, 260 in second class, and 1,086 in third class and [[steerage]].&lt;ref name=TSL&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/descriptions/ShipsCC.html | title = Ship Descriptions - C | publisher = TheShipsList.com | accessdate = 29 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Czar'' sailed on her maiden voyage on 30 May 1912 from Libau (present-day [[Liepāja]], Latvia) to [[Copenhagen]] and New York,&lt;ref name=TSL /&gt; arriving in the latter city on 13 June. She replaced {{SS|Lituania|1889|2}} on the Libau–New York route, and sailed opposite various combinations of {{SS|Kursk||2}}, {{SS|Russia||2}}, {{SS|Birma||2}}, and {{SS|Dwinsk||2}} through July 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Immigration Information Bureau, pp. 163, 172, 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- == SS ''Volturno'' rescue == --&gt;
On her 5 August 1913 sailing from Libau, ''Czar'' carried a young [[Mark Rothko]] and his family on their way to join his father in the United States; Rothko went on to become a well-known American [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painter and printmaker.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss et al., p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; On her October 1913 eastbound crossing, ''Czar'' responded to the distress calls of the Uranium Line steamer {{SS|Volturno|1906|2}} on fire in the middle of the Atlantic The liner joined nine other ships that came to the aid of the stricken ship. Amidst stormy seas, ''Czar''{{'}}s crew rescued 102 passengers from ''Volturno'', more than any other of the rescue ships, apart from the {{SS|Grosser Kurfürst}} which rescued 105.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Need more money for Volturno aid | url =  http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9805E2DA113CE633A25751C2A9669D946296D6CF | format = pdf | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 22 October 1913 | accessdate = 30 July 2008 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1914, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] of the United Kingdom, on recommendation of the [[Board of Trade]], awarded 19 of ''Czar''{{'}}s crew the [[Sea Gallantry Medal|Silver Sea Gallantry Medal]], along with a £3 award each.&lt;ref name=Sea_Gallantry&gt;{{cite news | title = Gallantry at sea | url = http://ca.geocities.com/volturno@rogers.com/volturno43.html | format = reprint | work = [[The Times]] | date = 11 March 1914 | accessdate = 30 July 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://ca.geocities.com/volturno%40rogers.com/volturno43.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+03:07:59|archivedate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War I ==
After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, ''Czar'' switched to service from [[Archangel (Russian city)|Archangel]] to New York,&lt;ref name=TSL /&gt; but ran only sporadically through 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Immigration Information Bureau, pp. 186, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the East Asiatic Company suspended service on the Russian American Line, and transferred several ships, including ''Czar'', to British registry.&lt;ref name=TSL /&gt; The British shipping controller initially placed the liner under the management of [[John Ellerman]]'s [[Thomas Wilson Sons &amp; Co.|Wilson Line]], but ''Czar'' was transferred to the [[Cunard Line]] management by the end of 1917.&lt;ref name=Mariners&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mariners-l.co.uk/EmpireP.html | title = EMPIRE - P | work = The 'Empire' Ships | publisher = Mariners | accessdate = 29 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known by this time as HMT ''Czar'', the ship, along with former Russian American Line ships {{HMT|Czaritza||2}}, ''Kursk'', and ''Dwinsk'', was attached to the [[Cruiser and Transport Force]] of the [[United States Navy]], and made three trips carrying American troops to France.&lt;ref&gt;Gleaves, p. 240. (Page 240 shows the date as &quot;July 1, 1916&quot;, but is wrong. See p. 102 for a description of the appendices with the correct date of 1 July 1918, listed.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Czar'' sailed on her first voyage with American troops on 16 April 1918, when she departed from the [[Hoboken Port of Embarkation]], with U.S. Navy transports {{SS|Maui|1916|2}}, {{USS|Calamares|ID-3662|2}}, {{USS|Pocahontas|ID-3044|2}}, {{USS|El Oriente|ID-4504|2}}, and British troopship HMT ''Czaritza''. The convoy was joined by transport {{USS|Mount Vernon|ID-4508|2}}&lt;ref group = Note&gt;{{USS|Mount Vernon|ID-4508|2}} had sailed from Hoboken on 19 April 1918, three days after ''Czar'' and her group.&lt;/ref&gt; and was escorted by American [[cruiser]] {{USS|Seattle|ACR-11|2}}. The convoy arrived safely in France on 28 April.&lt;ref name=C&amp;W-607-608&gt;Crowell and Wilson, pp. 607–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources do not report when ''Czar'' returned to the United States, but she had done so by early June.

''Czar'' loaded troops at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and set out on her second U.S. convoy crossing on 14 June, sailing with American transports {{USS|Princess Matoika|ID-2290|2}}, {{USS|Wilhelmina|ID-2168|2}}, {{USS|Pastores|ID-4540|2}}, and {{USS|Lenape|ID-2700|2}}. On the morning of 16 June, lookouts on ''Princess Matoika'' spotted a submarine and, soon after, a torpedo missed that ship by a few yards.&lt;ref name=Cutchins-66&gt;Cutchins and Stewart, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that morning, the Newport News ships met up with the New York portion of the convoy—which included {{USS|DeKalb|ID-3010|2}}, {{USS|Finland|ID-4543|2}}, {{USS|Kroonland|ID-1541|2}}, {{USS|George Washington|ID-3018|2}}, {{USS|Covington|ID-1409|2}}, {{USS|Rijndam|ID-2505|2}}, Italian steamer {{SS|Dante Alighieri||2}}, and British steamer ''Vauben''—and set out for France.&lt;ref name=Cutchins-67&gt;Cutchins and Stewart, p. 67.&lt;!-- time of meeting--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=C&amp;W-610-611&gt;Crowell and Wilson, pp. 610–11.&lt;!-- list of ships --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The convoy was escorted by American [[cruiser]]s {{USS|North Carolina|ACR-12|2}} and {{USS|Frederick|CA-8|2}}, and [[destroyer]]s {{USS|Stevens|DD-86|2}} and {{USS|Fairfax|DD-93|2}};&lt;ref name=C&amp;W-610-611 /&gt; [[battleship]] {{USS|Texas|BB-35|2}} and several other destroyers joined in escort duties for the group for a time.&lt;ref name=Cutchins-67 /&gt; The convoy had a false alarm when a floating barrel was mistaken for a submarine, but otherwise uneventfully arrived at Brest on the afternoon of 27 June.&lt;!-- date of arrival from C&amp;W --&gt;&lt;ref name=C&amp;W-610-611 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutchins-68&gt;Cutchins and Stewart, p. 68.&lt;!-- false alarm, uneventful nature of trip, time of day arrival --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMT Czar.jpg|thumb|left|HMT ''Czar'' seen in port, c. 1917–1920]]
When she departed Newport News on 7 October, ''Czar'' began her last voyage ferrying American troops to France. Sailing in company with U.S. Navy transports {{USS|Tenadores|1913|2}}, {{USS|Susquehanna|ID-3016|2}}, and {{USS|America|ID-3006|2}}, she rendezvoused with American transport {{USS|Kroonland|ID-1541|2}}, Italian steamer {{SS|Caserta||2}}, and British steamer ''Euripides'' out of New York. The convoy ships were escorted by cruisers ''Seattle'' and {{USS|Rochester|ACR-2|2}}, and destroyers {{USS|Murray|DD-97|2}} and {{USS|Fairfax|DD-93|2}}. The ships arrived safely in France on 20 October.&lt;ref name=CW-618&gt;Crowell and Wilson, p. 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1919 and into 1920, HMT ''Czar'' continued transporting Commonwealth troops under Cunard management. The troopship primarily sailed between British ports and Mediterranean ports such as [[Trieste]], [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]], and [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;''Czar''{{'}}s ports of call were listed in the &quot;Movements of liners&quot; or &quot;Latest shipping news&quot; features in ''The Times'' newspaper. For visits to the ports of [[Trieste]], [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]], and [[Constantinople]], see the editions of 30 December 1920 (p. 19), 27 February 1920 (p. 19), 30 January 1919 (p. 14), and 14 June 1920 (p. 23), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; One typical voyage from Alexandria returned 1,600 officers and men—who had been serving in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], and [[Egypt]]—to Plymouth in January 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Seasick soldiers | work = The Times | date = 14 January 1920 | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Czar'' also played a role in the [[North Russia Campaign]] of the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] when the liner departed [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] for North Russia on 28 August 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Movements of liners | work = The Times | date = 30 August 1919 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
H.M.T. Czar arrived in the Tyne, from Murmansk last Friday (15 August 1919), with about 1,800 British and Italian troops from the Syren Force North Russia. Amongst them were about 100 officers, N.C.O's and men of the 6th and 13th Battalions Yorkshire Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;The Seham Weekly News for weekending 22 August 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interwar civilian service ==
By late 1920, ''Czar'' had been returned to the East Asiatic Company, which placed her in service for the [[Baltic American Line]] under the new name of ''Estonia''. For her first Baltic American trip she sailed from Glasgow on 11 January 1921 for New York, [[Danzig]], and Libau, arriving at the latter by mid-February. Departing from Libau on 23 February, she began a regular Libau – Danzig – Boston – New York service, sailing opposite {{SS|Lituania|1915|2}} and {{SS|Polonia||2}}.&lt;ref name=TSL /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Immigration Information Bureau, p. 203.&lt;!-- other ships --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = Note&gt;{{SS|Lituania|1912|2}} and {{SS|Polonia||2}} were the former ''Czaritza'' and ''Kursk'', respectively. See: {{cite web| url = http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/balticam.htm | title = Baltic American Line | publisher = TheShipsList.com | date = 5 February 2005 | accessdate = 29 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1925, ''Estonia'' was reconditioned and outfitted with accommodations for 290 cabin-class and 500 third-class passengers. The following March, her accommodations were altered for 110 cabin-class, 180 tourist-class, and 500 third-class passengers. Her last voyage for the Baltic American Line began on 31 January 1930 when she sailed from Danzig to Copenhagen, [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], and New York. Sold to the [[Poland|Polish]]-owned [[Gdynia America Line]], she sailed 13 March for one more trip on the Danzig – New York route under the name ''Estonia''. Before her next voyage on 25 April, she was renamed ''Pułaski'', after Polish soldier and [[American Revolutionary War]] general [[Kazimierz Pułaski]]. SS ''Pułaski'' continued sailing the same route through August 1935, when she was moved to [[Gdynia]] – [[Buenos Aires]] service. She began her last voyage on this route on 21 April 1939.

== World War II ==
[[File:SS Pułaski.jpg|thumb|right|SS ''Pułaski'' seen in port c. 1930–1939]]
With the signing of the [[Anglo-Polish military alliance]] impending, ''Pułaski'' sailed from Gdynia to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] on 24 August 1939.&lt;ref name=TSL /&gt; On 26 September, the ship left [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] for [[Gibraltar]] (calling there on 2 September) and [[Piraeus]], where she arrived on 13 October.&lt;ref name=CPDB&gt;{{cite web | title = Port Arrivals/Departures: Pulaski | url = http://convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=PULASKI~armain | work = Arnold Hague's Ports Database | publisher = Convoy Web | accessdate = 29 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Picking up Polish soldiers there, she sailed five days later for [[Marseille]], where she eventually arrived on 2 December.&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt; Until March 1940, ''Pułaski'' underwent a refit in [[Marseille]] after which she sailed [[ship chartering|under charter]] to the French [[Fabre Line]].&lt;ref name=WS&gt;{{cite web | title = SS Pulaski | url = http://warsailors.com/forum/read.php?1,5961,5965#msg-5965 | publisher = WarSailors.com | date =  27 March 2003 | accessdate = 29 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1930s, the Fabre Line sailed ships on a Marseille–[[Dakar]] route with intermediate stops in other African ports.&lt;ref&gt;Brochure: {{cite book | title = Services Combinés, Fabre - Farissinet: Dakar et coté occidentale d'Afrique | publisher = Compagnie Générale de Navigation à Vapeur Cyprien Fabre | year = 1939 }} (Summary of port information online [http://www.timetableimages.com/maritime/images/fabre.htm here].)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March, ''Pułaski'' departed Marseille on the first of three voyages from that port. She sailed to [[Algiers]] and from there to [[Dakar]] on 13 March. ''Pułaski'' left Dakar for [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Konakry]], [[French Guinea]], returning to Dakar in early April. Sailing for Marseille on 5 April, the ship returned on 13 April as a part of convoy DF 29. Leaving again about two weeks later, she repeated the trip and returned to Marseille on 29 May as a part of convoy DF 41.&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt; By the time of her return, the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] had been underway for nearly three weeks.

''Pułaski'' sailed on her third and final French voyage on 6 June. The liner arrived at Dakar on 15 June, and sailed the next day for Freetown, where she arrived on 18 June.&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt; Likely because of the confusion surrounding the [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|French surrender]] on 22 June, ''Pułaski''{{'}}s movements over the next days are unrecorded, but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by [[Vichy France|Vichy]] authorities. That evening, ''Pułaski''{{'}}s crew raised steam and sailed the ship out of the harbor in defiance of the detainment. After taking fire from [[shore battery|shore batteries]] at Konakry,&lt;ref name=WS /&gt; the ship arrived back at Freetown on 9 July.&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt;

=== British trooping duties ===
On 14 August, ''Pułaski'', {{SS|Kościuszko||2}} (the latest name of the former ''Czaritza''), and {{MS|Batory||2}} were chartered by the [[Ministry of War Transport]] for trooping duties and placed under the management of [[Lamport &amp; Holt]] of [[Liverpool]]. All three ships retained their Polish crews but also carried a Lamport &amp; Holt liaison officer aboard.&lt;ref name=L&amp;H&gt;{{cite journal| last = Heaton | first = P.

''Pułaski'' and about half of the ships departed the convoy at Liverpool on 7 September, while the other half continued on for [[Methil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/sl2/index.html?sl.php?convoy=44!~slmain | title = Convoy SL.44 | work = Arnold Hague Convoy Database | publisher = ConvoyWeb | accessdate = 29 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pułaski'' next made her way to the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] in late October. Between 10 May and 12 June 1941, she sailed on three roundtrip trooping runs between Clyde and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt; In late June, ''Pułaski'', loaded with 2,047 troops, sailed from Clyde to join convoy WS 9B headed for Freetown.&lt;!-- sailing location --&gt;&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt;&lt;ref name=WS.9B&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/misc/index.html?yy.php?convoy=WS.9B!~miscmain | title = Convoy WS.9B | work = Arnold Hague Convoy Database | publisher = ConvoyWeb | accessdate = 29 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- convoy data --&gt; The convoy arrived at its destination on 13 July. After three days, ''Pułaski'' and four other ships sailed on to [[Cape Town]], arriving on 27 July. Leaving behind one ship at Cape Town, ''Pułaski'' and the others sailed on 30 July to their final destination of [[Aden]], where they arrived in mid August.&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt;&lt;ref name=WS.9B /&gt;

[[File:Allidina-Visram.jpg|thumb|left|''Pułaski'' made several stops in [[Kilindini]], where the [[British Eastern Fleet]] was based in 1942. The British code-breaking operation [[FECB]] was housed in the Allidina Visram school in 1942-43 (pictured here in 2006).]]
Over the next seven months, ''Pułaski'' operated in the [[Indian Ocean]], primarily sailing between Middle Eastern and East African ports. Beginning in late August, ''Pułaski'' sailed between Aden and ports of [[Suez]], [[Durban]], [[Berbera]], [[Mombasa]], [[Massawa]], [[Port Sudan]], and [[Kilindini]]. From Kilindini, in March 1942, the liner sailed to [[Colombo]] and back to Durban on 8 April.&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt; While at Durban, a fire gutted the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]] in what may have been sabotage.&lt;ref name=WS /&gt;

The damaged ''Pułaski'' made her way to [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] in [[South Africa]] on 11 April where she remained under repair until June. Departing East London on 25 June, she resumed her Middle Eastern and African runs between Aden, Suez, and Durban. In November, the transport departed Aden and called at [[Basra]], [[Bandar Abbas]], and [[Karachi]], before returning to Durban in early December. After nearly a two-month stay at Durban, ''Pułaski'' returned to her trooping duties in the Indian Ocean on 1 February 1943. She made her first visits to [[Diego Suarez, Malagasy Republic|Diego Suarez]], [[Zanzibar]], and [[Tamatave]] in March, and [[Djibouti]] in April.&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt;

After a return to East London from Durban on 30 May, the ship put in for another extended stay, this time for four months. Resuming her trooping runs on 29 September, ''Pułaski'' began a year of almost continuous sailing. During this span, which lasted until mid-September 1944, the ship called at [[Bombay]] twice in addition to numerous stops in Aden, Suez, Durban, and Kilindini. Putting in at Durban on 15 September,&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt; ''Pułaski'' had a general refit over the next four months.&lt;ref name=WS /&gt;

''Pułaski'' resumed her Indian Ocean service when she left Durban on 21 January 1945, headed for Kilindini. She visited [[Dar es Salaam]] for the first time in April, and departed from her first visit to [[Madras]] on [[Victory in Europe Day]], 8 May 1945. Headed to [[Akyab]], [[Burma]], she started the first of five India–Burma roundtrips through July. Over the next months, she shuttled between [[Rangoon]], [[Calcutta]] (where she was docked on [[Victory over Japan Day]]), [[Chittagong]], Madras, and Colombo, arriving at the latter port for the final time on 12 September. From Colombo she sailed into the [[Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]] for [[Singapore]] where she arrived for the first of several visits on 14 September, two days after the Japanese garrison there surrendered. Through the end of 1945, ''Pułaski'' continued sailing between Singapore and India, making additional stops at [[Port Swettenham]], Chittagong, [[Sourabaya]], and [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]].&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt;

''Pułaski'' arrived at Calcutta on 23 December 1945.&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt; After this time, the ship continued to sail in trooping duties in the Indian Ocean, though her specific movements are not known.&lt;ref group = Note&gt;The ship's movements after December 1945 are not found in source materials.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1946, ''Pułaski'' was purchased by the Ministry of War Transport for £100,000.&lt;ref name=WS /&gt; It was around this time the Polish crews of ''Pułaski'' and ''Kościuszko'' refused to be repatriated to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-occupied Poland. The crew members all signed British articles.&lt;ref name=L&amp;H /&gt; On 16 April 1946, ''Pułaski'' was formally handed over to British authorities, who renamed the vessel ''Empire Penryn'': ''Empire'' to match the naming convention for miscellaneous British [[auxiliary ship]]s; ''Penryn'' for the port of [[Penryn, Cornwall]].&lt;ref name=WS /&gt; Remaining under Lamport &amp; Holt management,&lt;ref name=L&amp;H /&gt; ''Empire Penryn'' performed trooping duties in the Mediterranean. The ship was taken out of service in 1948, and was scrapped at [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=WS /&gt;
