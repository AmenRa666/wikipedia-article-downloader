== Last revision... ==

Taksen, I've reverted the last edit because there's no source for this information - you need to show which book or article it came from (NB: I'm happy to help if I can). The other question I'd have is why this particular individual is important; there were hundreds of prisoners in Bastille over the years, so it might be worth explaining in a few words why he's worth mentioning here, e.g. &quot;The notable writer Jean-Louis Favier was one of those extensively questioned.&quot; or something like that. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 19:01, 22 February 2012 (UTC)

:Yesterday I started this article on [[Jean-Louis Favier]]; then someone wanted more links, because there were not any. Today I made three links where they would appropriate. Actually I missed a list of famous or interesting prisoners, so I could have added his name there. Now I had to put it somewhere in the text, which seemed to me &quot;dense&quot; and &quot;finished&quot;. Actually I expected a revert would happen, and earlier today I was thinking of translating De la Boumelles from the German Wikipedia, than I would have added something interesting for you, but I was too tired after cleaning my windows.  
:Before yesterday I knew nothing of Favier, but he seems really interesting, not only because an empty link existed already. He is interesting, because he was friendly with [[Prince Henry of Prussia]], who could have been appointed as king of the USA. Working on someone's biography gives me information on other people, I didn't expect.[[User:Taksen|Taksen]] ([[User talk:Taksen|talk]]) 20:59, 22 February 2012 (UTC)

== Copies of the Bastille's design? ==
&quot;The innovative design proved influential in both France and England and was widely copied.&quot; - This is an unusual assertion and at the least should be documented. Some examples would be nice as well.[[Special:Contributions/171.159.192.10|171.159.192.10]] ([[User talk:171.159.192.10|talk]]) 17:12, 29 April 2013 (UTC)
:Have a look in the body of the main article for the examples and references. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 17:28, 29 April 2013 (UTC)

== the &quot;Men with pickaxes&quot; picture ==

I don't think this picture is really appropriate for the way its used, mostly because at this resolution the men with pickaxes are next to invisible, and not clearly people. the lines on the far left that are apparently people could be anything really. [[Special:Contributions/74.134.235.157|74.134.235.157]] ([[User talk:74.134.235.157|talk]]) 19:50, 15 July 2013 (UTC)
:I've tweaked the caption slightly. See what you think. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 20:20, 15 July 2013 (UTC)

== Bibliographies... ==

83.114.190.238, the bibliography in a Wikipedia article is used for works referenced in the article; as noted previously, Cottret, Monique (1986), ''La Bastille à prendre : histoire et mythe de la forteresse royale'', is not used to support any the facts in the article, and so should not be in the bibliography. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 14:42, 1 November 2014 (UTC)
:Absolutely wrong. The 1986 book has influenced all further investigations. See Schama in particular. The chronology of research should also be taken into consideration.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/83.114.190.238|83.114.190.238]] ([[User talk:83.114.190.238|talk]]) 14:53, 1 November 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::I think you may have been confused by what I meant; in a Wikipedia article, the bibliography covers the works that are used ''in the specific Wikipedia article'' to support specific facts, for example in the in-line citations; Cottret 1986 is not used in any of the citations (have a look at the version before you added the additional work into the bibliography, and you'll see various citations to Cottret's 2010 chapter, but none to Cottret's 1986 book). If you're new to editing the wiki, take a look at [[Wikipedia:Citing sources]] which gives more details on how to cite sources.
