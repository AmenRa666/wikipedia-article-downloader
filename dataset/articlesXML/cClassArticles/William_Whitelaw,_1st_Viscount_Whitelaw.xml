'''William Stephen Ian Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KT|CH|MC|PC|DL}} (28 June 1918 – 1 July 1999), often known as '''Willie Whitelaw''', was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician who served in a wide number of [[Cabinet minister|Cabinet positions]], most notably as [[Home Secretary]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].

==Early life==
Whitelaw was born at the family estate, Monklaw, at [[Nairn]], in northeast [[Scotland]]. He never knew his father, William Alexander Whitelaw (born 1892), a member of a Scottish landed gentry family,&lt;ref&gt;A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland, 1898, volume 2, ed. Bernard Burke, pg 1585, 'Whitelaw of Gartshore'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb1015-gd101&lt;/ref&gt; who was killed in the [[First World War]] when he was a baby. Whitelaw was raised by his mother and paternal grandfather, [[William Whitelaw (Perth MP)|William Whitelaw]] (1868–1946), of Gartshore, Dumbartonshire, an [[Harrow School|Old Harrovian]] and alumnus of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;The Railway Gazette, volume 37, 1922, pg 553&lt;/ref&gt; landowner, M.P. for Perth 1892–1895, and chairman of the London and North-Eastern Railway Company.&lt;ref&gt;Current Biography Yearbook 1975, H. W. Wilson &amp; Co., 1976, pg 438&lt;/ref&gt; His grandmother Dorothy was the niece of the former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and author [[Benjamin Disraeli]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb1015-gd101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland, 1898, volume 2, ed. Bernard Burke, pg 1585, 'Whitelaw of Gartshore'&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitelaw was educated first at [[Wixenford School]], Wokingham, before passing the entrance exam to [[Winchester College]].   From there he went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he won a [[University Sporting Blue|blue]] for golf and joined the [[Officer Training Corps]]. By chance he was in a summer camp in 1939 on the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and was granted a regular, not wartime, [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the [[British Army]], in the [[Scots Guards]], later serving in the [[British 6th Guards Tank Brigade|6th Guards Tank Brigade]], a separate unit from the [[Guards Armoured Division]]. He commanded [[Churchill tank]]s in [[Normandy]] during the Second World War and during [[Operation Bluecoat]] in late July 1944. His was the first Allied unit to encounter German ''[[Jagdpanther]]'' tank destroyers, being attacked by three out of the twelve of these vehicles which were in Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Operation Bluecoat |first=I. |last=Daglish |publisher=Pen &amp; Sword |year=2009 |pages=70–73|isbn=0-85052-912-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battalion's second-in-command was killed when his tank was hit in front of Whitelaw's eyes, and Whitelaw succeeded to this position, holding it, with the rank of Major, throughout the advance through the [[Netherlands]] into Germany and until the end of the war. He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his actions at Caumont; a photograph of [[Field-Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] pinning the medal to his chest appears in his memoirs. After the end of the war in Europe, Whitelaw's unit was to have taken part in the invasion of Japan, but the [[Pacific War]] ended before this. Instead he was posted to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], before leaving the army in 1946 to take care of the family estates of Gartshore and Woodhall in [[Lanarkshire]], which he inherited on the death of his grandfather.

==Political career==
After early defeats as a candidate for the constituency of [[East Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Dunbartonshire]], he became Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith and the Border]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 general election]], and represented that constituency for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Pcommons1.htm leighrayment.com House of Commons: Paddington to Platting]&lt;/ref&gt; He held his first government posts under [[Harold Macmillan]] as a [[Lord of the Treasury]] (government whip) between 1961 and 1962 and under Macmillan and then Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home]] as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour]] between 1962 and 1964. In 1964 Douglas-Home appointed him as Opposition [[Chief Whip]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} He was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] in January 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44210|date=30 December 1966|startpage=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heath Government, 1970–1974===
When the Conservatives returned to power in 1970 under [[Edward Heath]], Whitelaw was made [[Lord President of the Council]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]], with a seat in the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=45134|date=23 June 1970|startpage=6953}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] after the imposition of direct rule in March 1972 and he served in that capacity until November 1973. During his time, in Northern Ireland he introduced [[Special Category Status]] for paramilitary prisoners. He attempted to negotiate with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] with the then PIRA Chief of Staff [[Seán MacStiofáin]] in July 1972. The talks ended in an agreement to change from a seven-day truce, to an open-ended truce, which did not last long. As a briefing for prime minister Edward Heath later noted, Whitelaw &quot;found the experience of meeting and talking to Mr MacStíofáin very unpleasant&quot;. MacStiofáin in his memoir, complimented Whitelaw, saying he was the only Englishman ever to pronounce his name in Irish correctly.&lt;ref&gt;MacStiofáin, Seán ''Revolutionary in Ireland'', pp. 281–89&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Northern Ireland in 1973 to become [[Secretary of State for Employment]] shortly before the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] was reached, to confront the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] over pay demands. The dispute was followed by the Conservative party losing the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Also in 1974, Whitelaw became a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/misc/compofhonor.htm leighrayment.com Companions of Honour]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opposition, 1974–1979===
Soon after [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour Party returned to government, Heath appointed Whitelaw as Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Chairman of the Conservative Party. After a second defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]] – during which Whitelaw had accused [[Harold Wilson]] of going &quot;round and round the country stirring up apathy&quot;, Heath was forced to call a [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975|leadership election]] in 1975. Whitelaw loyally refused to run against Heath; however, and to widespread surprise, [[Margaret Thatcher]] narrowly defeated Heath in the first round. Whitelaw stood in his place and lost convincingly, against Thatcher in the second round. The vote polarised along right-left lines, with in addition the region, experience and education of the MP having their effects.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Cowley and Matthew Bailey, &quot;Peasants' Uprising or Religious War? Re-Examining the 1975 Conservative Leadership Contest,&quot; ''British Journal of Political Science'' (2000) 30#4 pp. 599–629 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/194287 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitelaw managed to maintain his position as Deputy Leader until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], when he was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] in Thatcher's new government.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher: From Grantham to the Falklands'' (2013) p 427&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home Secretary, 1979–1983===

Thatcher was a firm fan of Whitelaw's, and appointed him Home Secretary in her first Cabinet, later writing of him &quot;Willie is a big man in character as well as physically. He wanted the success of the Government which from the first he accepted would be guided by my general philosophy. Once he had pledged his loyalty, he never withdrew it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Thatcher]], ''The Downing Street Years'' (HarperCollins, 1993), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Home Secretary, Whitelaw adopted a hard-line approach to law and order. He improved police pay and embarked upon a programme of extensive prison building. His four-year tenure in office, however, was generally perceived as a troubled one. His much vaunted &quot;[[short, sharp shock]]&quot; policy, whereby convicted young offenders were detained in secure units and subjected to quasi-military discipline won approval from the public but proved expensive to implement and largely ineffectual in stemming burgeoning crime rates. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}  He was the British Home Secretary during the 6-day long [[Iranian Embassy siege]] in London, 30 April 1980 – 5 May 1980.

In March 1981, he approved [[Wolverhampton]] council's 14-day ban on political marches in the borough in response to a planned [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] demonstration there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xgdfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4Y0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6565,4462303&amp;dq=wolverhampton+million+unemployment&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inner city]] decay, unemployment and what was perceived at the time as heavy-handed policing of [[ethnic minorities]] (notably the application of what some called the &quot;notorious&quot; [[sus law]]) sparked major riots in London, [[Liverpool]], Bristol and a spate of disturbances elsewhere. The [[Provisional IRA]] escalated its bombing campaign on England.

===Leader of the House of Lords, 1983–1988===
Two days after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], Whitelaw received a [[hereditary peer]]age (the first created for 18 years) as '''Viscount Whitelaw''', of Penrith in the County of Cumbria.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=49394 |date=21 June 1983 |startpage=8199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher appointed him [[Lord President of the Council]] and [[Leader of the House of Lords]]. Lord Whitelaw faced many challenges in attempting to manage the [[House of Lords]], facing a major defeat over abolition of the [[Greater London Council]] within a year of taking over. However, his patrician and moderate style appealed to Conservative peers and his tenure is considered a success. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

During his period as Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Lords, Margaret Thatcher relied on Whitelaw heavily, famously announcing that &quot;every Prime Minister needs a Willie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2003/jun/18/changes-to-government-departments#S5LV0649P0_20030618_HOL_105]&lt;/ref&gt; He chaired the &quot;[[star chamber]]&quot; committee that settled the annual disputes between the limited resources made available by Treasury and the spending demands of other government departments. It was Whitelaw who managed to dissuade Thatcher in November 1980 from going to [[Leeds]] to take charge of the [[Yorkshire Ripper]] investigation personally. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Resignation===
After a stroke in December 1987, he was forced to resign. Some people, [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], among them, argued that Whitelaw's retirement marked the beginning of the end of the Thatcher premiership, as he was no longer around as often to give sensible advice and to moderate her stance on issues, or to maintain a consensus of support in her own Cabinet and Parliamentary Party.

==Retirement and death==
[[File:Whitelaw grave.jpg|thumb|200px|The grave of William Whitelaw]]

During his retirement and up until his death Lord Whitelaw was the chairman of the board of Governors at [[St Bees School]], Cumbria. He was appointed a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=52351|date=30 November 1990|startpage=18550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of natural causes, aged 81, in 1999, survived by his wife of 56 years, [[Celia Whitelaw, Viscountess Whitelaw|Celia, Viscountess Whitelaw]] (1 January 1917 – 5 December 2011), a [[World War II]] [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]], volunteer, philanthropist/charity worker and horticulturist. The couple had four daughters. Although Whitelaw was given a hereditary peerage, the title became extinct on his death as his daughters were unable to inherit.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} His home for many years was the mansion of [[Ennim]] just outside the village of [[Blencow|Great Blencow]] near [[Penrith, Cumbria]]. He was buried at [[St Andrew's Church, Dacre|St. Andrew's Parish Church]], [[Dacre, Cumbria]].

==In popular culture==
* Whitelaw was portrayed by [[John Standing]] in the [[BBC]] production of ''[[The Falklands Play]]'' (2002) by [[Ian Curteis]].
* The character of Whitelaw also appeared in a smaller role in ''[[Margaret (2009 film)|Margaret]]'', where he was portrayed as a moderating influence on Thatcher and [[Michael Heseltine]] in Cabinet. Whitelaw was played by [[Robert Hardy]].
* Part of a speech detailing the &quot;[[Short, sharp shock]]&quot; concept of juvenile offender incarceration given by Whitelaw during 1979 is excerpted in the fadeout at the end of [[Gerry Rafferty]]'s song &quot;The Garden of England&quot; (1980), from the album [[Snakes and Ladders (Gerry Rafferty album)|''Snakes and Ladders'']]: {{Cquote|''We Conservatives have always maintained the need for an experiment with a tougher regime for depriving young football hooligans of their leisure time. I can announce today that the experiment promised in our election manifesto is to begin in Surrey ... These will be no holiday camps. We will introduce on a regular basis drill, parades, and inspections ... from 6:45am 'til lights out at 9:30pm. Life will be conducted at a brisk tempo.''}}
* The folk album, ''England's Vietnam – Irish Songs of Resistance,'' by the Men of No Property (Folkways Records, 1977), contains a track called ''Tuten Carson's Tomb.'' The song portrays a tour guide supposedly guiding visitors through the [[St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast|St Anne's Cathedral]] tomb of [[Ulster Unionist]] leader [[Sir Edward Carson]] and pointing out artifacts. Referring to Whitelaw's period as the first [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], it contains the line, &quot;A flak vest made of solid jade/A gift that Whitelaw made.&quot;
