The '''Yugoslav submarine ''Smeli''''' (Daring) was the second of the {{sclass-|Osvetnik|submarine|0}} [[diesel-electric]] [[submarine]]s built by [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]], [[Nantes]], France for the navy of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia). She was launched in 1928, and was built to a partial [[double hull]] Simonot design similar to the French {{sclass-|Circé|submarine|4}}. She was armed with six {{convert|550|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]], one {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and one {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]], and could dive to {{convert|80|m|ft}}.

Prior to [[World War II]] she participated in several cruises to [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] ports. During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, she was captured by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian forces]] at the [[Bay of Kotor]]. Initially designated ''N2'', her armament was changed and her [[conning tower]] modified. Due to her age and shallow diving depth, when she was commissioned into the [[Regia Marina]] as '''''Antonio Bajamonti''''' her service was limited to training and experimentation. She was [[scuttling|scuttled]] at [[La Spezia]] in [[Liguria]] by the Italians in September 1943 the day after the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender]].

==Description and construction==
Yugoslav naval policy in the [[interwar period]] lacked direction until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=732}} although it was generally accepted that the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of [[submarine]]s, coastal [[torpedo boat]]s, [[torpedo bomber]]s and conventional [[bomber]] aircraft to perform this role. The {{sclass-|Osvetnik|submarine|0}} submarines were intended to meet part of this challenge.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=779}}

''Smeli'' was built for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) by the [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] company (ACL) at [[Nantes]], France. Her partial [[double hull]] design{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=171}} was based on plans by ACL's chief engineer, G. Simonot,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} and was similar to the French {{sclass-|Circé|submarine|4}}.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}} Her [[Serbo-Croatian]] name translates as &quot;Daring&quot;. Along with her [[sister ship|sister submarine]] of the class, {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Osvetnik||2}}, she had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|66.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a surfaced [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|3.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Her surfaced [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|630|LT}} or {{convert|809|LT}} submerged, and her crew consisted of 43 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} She had an operational depth of {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}}

She had two shafts driven by two [[MAN SE|MAN]] (Maschinenfabrik) [[diesel engine]]s (when surfaced) or two Nancy electric motors (when submerged), and carried {{convert|25|t|LT}} of [[fuel oil]]. The diesel engines were rated at {{convert|1480|bhp|lk=in|abbr=on}} and the electric motors at {{convert|1000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}}, and she was designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|14.5|kn|lk=in}} under diesel power while surfaced, and {{convert|9.2|kn}} on her electric motors when submerged.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}} She was armed with six {{convert|550|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]] (four bow-mounted, two stern-mounted), one {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and one {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}  She had a surfaced radius of action of {{convert|3500|nmi}} at {{convert|9|kn}}, and {{convert|75|nmi|lk=no}} at {{convert|5|kn}} submerged.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}}

==Service history==
''Smeli'' was the second of her class, and the fourth submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]]). She was launched on 1 December 1928.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} She and ''Osvetnik'' arrived in the [[Bay of Kotor]] on 9 December 1929.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}} In October 1934, ''Smeli'' visited [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]], and the [[Kelibia]] [[Roadstead|Roads]] off the coast of Tunisia.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=544}} In August and September 1937, ''Smeli'', along with the British-made submarine [[Yugoslav submarine Hrabri|''Hrabri'']] and the depot ship [[Yugoslav minelayer Zmaj|''Zmaj'']], visited Greece, including the port of [[Piraeus]], and the islands of [[Crete]] and Corfu.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=838}}

When the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] began on 6 April 1941, she was in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast along with the three other submarines of the Submarine Division.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=267}} On 17 April she was captured by the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] [[XVII Corps (Italy)|XVII Corps]] at the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=251}}{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=457}} Still in good condition, she was taken as war booty, and initially designated ''N2''. She was refitted and modernised at [[Pula|Pola]] in the upper Adriatic, which involved the replacement of some of her armament and modifications to her [[conning tower]]. Her new displacement was {{convert|665|LT}} ({{convert|822|LT}} submerged).{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|pp=170–171}} She was commissioned by the Italians as the {{sclass-|Bajamonti|submarine|0}} ''Antonio Bajamonti'', named after the [[Antonio Bajamonti|19th-century politician]] and mayor of the [[Dalmatia]]n port of [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. Despite her stability when submerged and good diving rate, her age and shallow diving depth limited her uses to training and experimentation.{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|pp=170–171}} She was [[scuttling|scuttled]] by the Italians at [[La Spezia]] in [[Liguria]] on 9 September 1943, the day after the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}
