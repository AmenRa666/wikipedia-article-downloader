{{Campaignbox Seven Years' War: European}}

The '''Battle of Cape Finisterre''' was a naval engagement fought off the Northern Spanish [[Atlantic]] coast near [[Cape Finisterre]] between British and French squadrons during the [[Seven Years' War]]. A British force comprising the 74-gun [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Bellona (1760)|HMS ''Bellona'']] and 36-gun [[frigate]] [[HMS Brilliant (1757)|HMS ''Brilliant'']] was sailing from [[Lisbon]] to Britain with a cargo of [[Bullion coin|specie]] when on 13 August they encountered a French force comprising the 74-gun [[French ship Courageux (1753)|''Courageux'']] and the 32-gun frigates [[French frigate Malicieuse|''Malicieuse'']] and [[French frigate Hermione|''Hermione'']]. The British ships immediately chased the French squadron, maintaining contact through the night, and on the following morning two separate engagements occurred as ''Brilliant'' fought the French frigates and ''Bellona'' battled ''Courageux''.

In a short but hard-fought engagement both ships of the line were damaged. The battle was decided when ''Bellona''{{'}}s captain, [[Robert Faulknor (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Faulknor]] succeeded in manoeuvering his ship into a [[raking fire|raking]] position, inflicting severe damage and appalling casualties on ''Courageux'', forcing the French ship to surrender. Although outnumbered, ''Brilliant'' successfully held off the French frigates, preventing them from intervening in the battle between the ships of the line, ''Malicieuse'' and ''Hermione'' both successfully withdrew following the surrender of ''Courageux''. ''Courageux'' was subsequently repaired and recommissioned in the Royal Navy, serving for 35 years in two later conflicts.

==Action==

===Background===
Following their defeat [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in 1759, the [[French Navy]] was no longer able to compete with the [[Royal Navy]] for control of European waters in the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC232&quot;&gt;Clowes, p.232&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1761 the Royal Navy capitalised on its regional dominance to [[Capture of Belle Île|invade]] [[Belle Île]], an island off [[Brittany]], which was captured in June.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC236&quot;&gt;Clowes, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; With the main French Atlantic fleet confined to harbour, smaller squadrons were sent to conduct raiding operations. One squadron comprised the 74-gun [[ship of the line]] [[French ship Courageux (1753)|''Courageux'']] under Captain Dugué L'Ambert and the 32-gun frigates [[French frigate Malicieuse|''Malicieuse'']] under Captain Longueville and [[French frigate Hermione|''Hermione'']] under Captain Montigney, which was sent to the [[West Indies]]. After a very successful raiding cruise, the squadron returned to European Waters in early August.&lt;ref name=&quot;ES148&quot;/&gt;

In the late evening of 13 August 1761 L'Ambert's squadron was sailing towards the Spanish coast, off [[Cape Finisterre]], when sails were sighted close inshore to the north east.&lt;ref name=&quot;LG1&quot;/&gt; This was a British squadron of the 74-gun ship of the line [[HMS Bellona (1760)|HMS ''Bellona'']] under Captain [[Robert Faulknor (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Faulknor]] and 36-gun frigate [[HMS Brilliant (1757)|HMS ''Brilliant'']] under Captain [[John Loggie]] sailing from [[Lisbon]] to Britain with a cargo of more than £100,000 in [[Bullion coin|specie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ES148&quot;/&gt; The French initially identified both British ships as ships of the line and turned away in the face of perceived British superiority, attempting to escape in the darkness, but the bright [[moonlight]] enabled the British to remain in pursuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC306&quot;&gt;Clowes, p.306&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle===
At 05:00 on the morning of 14 August, L'Ambert changed his opinion of the strength of the British squadron, assuming that ''Bellona'' was a 50-gun [[fourth rate ship]]. Confident of victory, he turned his squadron back towards Faulknor's ships, ordering ''Malicieuse'' and ''Hermione'' to attack ''Brilliant'' while he led ''Courageux'' against ''Bellona''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC306&quot;/&gt; The ships of the line approached one another head on, L'Ambert pulling ''Courageux'' alongside ''Bellona'' at 06:25 and opening fire with his [[broadside]] at close range. Faulknor delayed his response until the second broadside, his crew firing two broadsides of their own in quick succession while he backed his sails, throwing ''Bellona'' into reverse and swinging alongside ''Courageux''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ES148&quot;&gt;Shelton, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; The French ship's gunnery was however more effective in the initial stages of the action, and Faulknor's [[mizenmast]] was brought crashing down nine minutes after the first gunfire.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC307&quot;/&gt; When a crewman expressed dismay at this damage, Faulknor was reported to have responded &quot;Confound you! you rascal, what has a two-decked ship to do with a mizen-mast in the time of action. See and knock away his mizenmast.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ES148&quot;/&gt;

Faulknor was now concerned that, with his ability to manoeuvere his ship compromised, L'Ambert might take the opportunity to escape, and he planned to initiate a [[naval boarding|boarding action]] to seize ''Courageux'',&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC307&quot;/&gt; but the French ship sheered away, her own mizenmast coming down at 06:45. Despite the severe damage to his sails and rigging, Faulknor then attempted to [[Jibe (sailing)|wear around]], successfully bringing ''Bellona'' across the French ship's starboard stern quarter and firing a series of [[raking fire|raking]] broadsides. These causes enormous damage to the hull of ''Courageux'', killing and wounding hundreds of sailors and convincing the mortally wounded L'Ambert to [[strike his colours]] and surrender at 07:04.&lt;ref name=&quot;LG1&quot;/&gt; Some of the lower deck guns on the French ship had continued firing after the surrender, and Faulknor ordered two further broadsides to be fired into the shattered hull of ''Courageux'' to ensure its compliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ES148&quot;/&gt;

While ''Bellona'' and ''Courageux'' fought their duel, ''Brilliant'' successfully fought off the two French frigates from 06:00 to 07:30, attacked first by ''Malicieuse'' and then by ''Hermione'' in turn, deliberately preventing them from intervening in the battle between the larger ships. When it became clear that L'Ambert had surrendered, the French frigates made sail and retreated, ''Brilliant'' remaining with ''Bellona'' and their prize. British losses in the battle numbered six killed and 28 wounded on ''Bellona'' and five killed and 16 wounded on ''Brilliant'', while losses on ''Courageux'' alone were listed in Faulknor's after action report as the very high figures of 240 killed and 110 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;LG1&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=10136|startpage=2|date=1 September 1761|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[William Laird Clowes]] considers that this discrepancy was probably the result of differences in British and French tactical doctrine, the French trained to fire at the masts and rigging of an enemy ship in order to disable them, while British doctrine trained crews to fire into the hull of enemy ships to kill the crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC307&quot;&gt;Clowes, p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
The captured ''Courageux'' was taken to Lisbon under a prize crew,&lt;ref name=&quot;LG1&quot;/&gt; to be greeted by cheering crowds.&lt;ref name=&quot;ES148&quot;/&gt; A later historian wrote &quot;I can only compare the conduct of the ''Bellona'' to that of a dextrous gladiator, who not only plants his own blows with certainty, but also guards against those of his antagonist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ES148&quot;/&gt; Writing in 1825, historian [[Edward Pelham Brenton]] listed the battle as one of only four decisive encounters between single ships of the line of comparable size in the history of warfare under sail (the others being the [[Battle of Ushant (1782)|Battle of Ushant]] in 1782 when [[HMS Foudroyant (1758)|HMS ''Foudroyant'']] captured ''[[French ship Pégase (1781)|Pégase]]'', the [[Battle of the Raz de Sein]] in April 1798, when [[HMS Mars (1794)|HMS ''Mars'']] captured ''[[HMS Hercule (1798)|Hercule]]'' and the [[Battle of Pirano]] in February 1812 when [[HMS Victorious (1808)|HMS ''Victorious'']] captured ''[[French ship Rivoli (1810)|Rivoli]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EPB388&quot;&gt;Brenton, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;  Following repairs, ''Courageux'' joined the Royal Navy as HMS ''Courageux'', serving for 35 years and seeing action in the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolutionary War]] before being wrecked in a storm at [[Monte Hacho]] on 18 December 1796 with the loss of more than 470 lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;TG41&quot;&gt;Grocott, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;
