'''Khamis Gaddafi''' (27 May 1983 – 29 August 2011) was the seventh and youngest son of former [[Libya under Gaddafi|Libyan leader]] [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and the [[military commander]] in charge of the [[Khamis Brigade]] of the [[Libyan Army (1951–2011)|Libyan Army]]. He was part of his father's inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/02/2011227192852808945.html|title=Inside Gaddafi's inner circle|work=Al Jazeera|date=27 February 2011|accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] in 2011, he was a major target for [[anti-Gaddafi forces|opposition forces]] trying to overthrow his father.&lt;ref name=arraideathsource&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thURLSzjiIE|title=نعي لشهيد خاض معارك باسلة الشهيد خميس القذافي|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
At age three, Khamis Gaddafi was injured in the 15 April 1986 [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|U.S. bombing of Libya]], suffering head injuries when the [[Bab al-Azizia]] military compound was attacked in retaliation for the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Greenwood Library of American War Reporting: The Vietnam War &amp; post-Vietnam conflicts|page=346|last=Copeland|first=David A.|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|year=2005|isbn=978-0-313-32930-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the military academy in [[Tripoli]], receiving a [[bachelor's degree]] in military arts and science, further graduating from the [[Frunze Military Academy]] in [[Moscow]] and the Academy of the General Staff Academy of the Armed Forces of the [[Russian Federation]]. In 2008, Gaddafi visited [[Algeria]], where he was received by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ELPAIS22feb&quot;/&gt;

In April 2010, he began a [[master's degree]] at the [[IE Business School]] (formerly known as [[Instituto de Empresa]]), in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ELPAIS22feb&quot;&gt;{{cite news|language=Spanish|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/hijo/Gadafi/estudia/master/Madrid/elpepuint/20110222elpepuint_29/Tes|title=Un hijo de Gadafi estudia un master en Madrid|work=El País|date=22 February 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|location=Madrid|trans_title=Gaddafi's son is studying a Masters in Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was expelled by the institution in March 2011 for &quot;his links to the attacks against the Libyan population&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg4March&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-04/madrid-s-ie-business-school-expels-qaddafi-s-son-from-mba-1-.html|title=Madrid’s IE Business School Expels Qaddafi's Son From MBA|work=Bloomberg L.P.|date=4 March 2011|accessdate=20 June 2011|first=Emma|last=Ross-Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, Gaddafi worked as an intern at [[AECOM|AECOM Technology Corporation]]. According to Paul Gennaro, AECOM's Senior Vice President for Global Communications, Gaddafi was touring the [[United States]] in February 2011 as part of his internship, including visiting military sites and landmarks. This trip was cut short on 17 February after the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] began, and Gaddafi returned to Libya. U.S. government officials later denied any role in planning, advising or paying for the trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8408270/Khamis-Gaddafi-toured-US-military-facilities-weeks-before-Libya-crisis.html|title=Khamis Gaddafi toured US military facilities weeks before Libya crisis|work=The Telegraph|date=26 March 2011|accessdate=20 June 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the Libyan civil war==
{{main|Khamis Brigade}}
After hurrying back to Libya to aid his father in the civil war, Khamis Gaddafi commanded the assault on [[First Battle of Zawiya|Zawiya]], leading the [[Khamis Brigade]], a [[special forces]] [[brigade]] of the [[Armed forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libyan Armed Forces]] loyal to [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;International Business Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/114681/20110221/khamis-gaddafi-mercenaries-chad-benghazi.htm|title=Khamis Gaddafi Recruits Mercenaries to Shoot Protestors|date=11 February 2011|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/02/18/998374/gadhafi-rallies-supporters-amid.html|title=Libyan forces storm protest camp in Benghazi|agency=Associated Press|work=News Observer|first=Maggie|last=Michael|date=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afrol.com/articles/37412|title=Khamis Ghaddafi: The agent of fear|work=Afrol News|date=23 February 2011|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle resulted in pro-Gaddafi forces retaking the city. He also assisted in [[2011 Tripoli clashes|suppressing anti-regime demonstrations]] in and around the capital Tripoli in late February-early March. His forces also took part in the [[Battle of Misrata]]. In June 2011, he was reported to be commanding pro-Gaddafi forces in [[Zliten]] by a soldier captured from his brigade who also reported that Khamis Gaddafi had told his troops to &quot;take Misrata or I will kill you myself. If you don’t take Misrata, we are finished.&quot;&lt;ref name=alive/&gt;

== Rumors of death ==

=== Libyan civil war ===

==== 13 March 2011: Alleged suicide attack on Bab al-Azizia ====
On 20 March 2011, it was reported by the anti-Gaddafi Al Manara Media that Khamis Gaddafi had died from injuries sustained when pilot Muhammad Mokhtar Osman allegedly crashed his plane into [[Bab al-Azizia]] a week earlier. This was not confirmed by any independent news source. The crashing of the plane itself had also not been previously reported or confirmed by any other independent media except Al Manara and the Algerian ''Shuruk'' newspaper, which is closely connected to Al Manara, and with it there is a possibility of the reports being part of the propaganda operations by the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1368410/Libya-crisis-Gaddafi-uses-civilians-human-shields-prevent-military-targets.html|location=London|work=Daily Mail|first=Richard|last=Hartley-Parkinson|title=For the sins of his father: Gaddafi's son 'killed in kamikaze pilot attack on barracks'|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailyplanetdispatch.com/gaddafis-son-khamis-killed-by-kamikaze-pilot-claim/856968|title=Gaddafi's Son Khamis Killed By Kamikaze Pilot Claims|work=Daily Planet Dispatch|date=21 March 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|first=Chris|last=Loy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-Gaddafi Libyan government subsequently denied that he was killed on 21 March.&lt;ref name=denied&gt;{{cite news|work=Yedioth Ahronoth|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4045624,00.html|title=Libya denies report of Gaddafi son's death|date=21 March 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] stated that she was aware of reports that one of Gaddafi's sons had been killed in non-coalition air strikes, after hearing them from &quot;many different sources&quot;, but that the &quot;evidence is not sufficient&quot; for her to confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-diane-sawyer-moammar-gadhafi-allies-seeking/story?id=13196414|title=Exclusive: Gadhafi, Allies May Be Seeking Way Out, Clinton tells ABC News|work=ABC News|date=22 March 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|first=Huma|last=Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/africa/libya-live-blog-march-23|title=Libya Live Blog – March 23|work=Al Jazeera|date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 2011, [[Al Arabiya]] television reported that a source had confirmed the death of Khamis Gaddafi,&lt;ref name=GBVOICE&gt;{{cite web|work=Global Voices Online|url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/25/libya-is-khamis-gaddafi-really-dead/|title=Libya: Is Khamis Gaddafi Really Dead?|date=25 March 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|first=Amira|last=Al Hussaini}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others including [[Al Jazeera]] continued to call it a rumour.&lt;ref name=rumour&gt;{{cite news|work=Al Jazeera|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/africa/live-blog-libya-march-26|title=Live Blog Libya – 26 March|date=26 March 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2011, the Libyan government showed footage of what it said was live footage of Khamis Gaddafi greeting supporters in [[Tripoli]], in an attempt to refute the claims,&lt;ref name=&quot;video&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first1=Joseph|last1=Nasr|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFLDE72R29Z20110329|title=Libya TV says shows live footage of Khamis Gaddafi|work=Reuters|date=29 March 2011|agency=Reuters|accessdate=11 August 2011|last2=Amara|first2=Tarek}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it had used false live images before and these images were not verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/africa/libya-live-blog-march-19|title=Live Blog – 19 March|work=Al Jazeera|date=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 June 2011, a captured pro-Gaddafi soldier in [[Misrata]] told the rebels that Khamis Gaddafi was alive in [[Zliten]], and was leading the soldiers there.&lt;ref name=&quot;alive&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyan-rebels-stage-insurrection-in-zlitan/2011/06/10/AGpi44OH_story.html|title=Libyan rebels stage insurrection in Zlitan|work=The Washington Post|date=10 June 2011| accessdate=5 August 2011|last=Fadel|first=Leila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====5 August 2011: Airstrike in Zliten====
On 5 August 2011, citing spies operating among the ranks of forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi, Mohammed Zawawi, a spokesman for the United Revolutionary Forces, told the [[Agence France Press]] news agency that Khamis Gaddafi had been killed overnight, stating that &quot;there was a aircraft attack by [[NATO]] on the Gaddafi operations room in Zliten and there are around 32 Gaddafi troops killed. One of them is Khamis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8683248/Gaddafi-son-killed-in-Nato-strike-Libyan-rebels-claim.html|title=Gaddafi son killed in Nato strike, Libyan rebels claim|work=The Telegraph|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=5 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This report was officially denied by Libyan government spokesman [[Moussa Ibrahim]]. &quot;It's false news. They invented the news about Mr. Khamis Gaddafi in Zliten to cover up their killing,&quot; Ibrahim told [[Reuters]] in Tripoli. &quot;This is a dirty trick to cover up their crime in Zliten and the killing of the al-Marabit family.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/05/libya-son-denial-idAFLDE7740GV20110805|title=Tripoli denies Gaddafi son killed in NATO raid|work=Reuters|date=5 August 2011|agency=Reuters|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO was also unable to confirm the reports of Khamis's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/126902573.html|date=6 August 2011|first1=Rami|last1=al-Shaheibi|title=Libya regime: Gadhafi son alive|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=8 August 2011|last2=al-Shalchi|first2=Hadeel}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August, a man who appeared to be Khamis Gaddafi was on Libyan state television speaking to a woman who had allegedly been severely injured by a NATO airstrike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE77818V20110809|title=Libyan TV shows footage of Khamis Gaddafi|work=Reuters|date=9 August 2011|agency=Reuters|accessdate=10 August 2011|last=Nasr|first=Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====22 August 2011: Reports of bodies in Tripoli====
On 22 August, Al Jazeera reported that the bodies of both Khamis Gaddafi and his father's intelligence chief [[Abdullah Senussi]] may have been discovered in Tripoli during the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|battle for the city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/world/africa/23mystery.html|work=The New York Times| first=Rick|last=Gladstone|title=Qaddafi's Whereabouts Still a Mystery in Libya|date=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a rebel commander later stated that he believed Khamis Gaddafi was in [[Bab al-Azizia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.cntv.cn/20110823/100261.shtml|title=Qaddafi's sixth son Khamis may hide in Bab al-Aziziya: rebel|date=22 August 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|work=CNTV|location=Benghazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senussi was found alive and captured in [[Mauritania]] on 17 March 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17413626|title=Gaddafi spy chief Abdullah al-Senussi held in Mauritania|date=17 March 2012|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/9150099/Muammar-Gaddafis-spy-chief-Senussi-arrested-in-Mauritania.html|title=Muammar Gaddafi's spy chief Senussi 'arrested in Mauritania'|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=17 March 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was extradited to Libya on 5 September for trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mauritania 'extradites Libya ex-spy chief Abdullah al-Senussi'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19487228|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====29 August 2011: Airstrike near Tarhuna====
On 29 August, it was reported that anti-Gaddafi fighters 60&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Tripoli]] claimed that a NATO [[AgustaWestland Apache|Apache]] helicopter had fired on Khamis Gaddafi's [[Toyota Land Cruiser]], destroying the vehicle. A man who claimed to be Khamis Gaddafi's bodyguard said he had been killed. No visual confirmation was immediately available.&lt;ref name=&quot;sky&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16058574|title=Rebels: Gaddafi's Son 'Killed In Air Strike'|work=Sky News|date=29 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, ''[[The Guardian]]'' interviewed a former guard being held captive in [[Tarhuna]]. His personal guard, Abdul Salam Taher Fagri, a 17-year-old from [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], recruited in Tripoli, later confirmed that Khamis Gaddafi was indeed killed in this attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;deathsource&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2032801/Khamis-Gaddafi-killed-Rebels-took-vengeance-despite-car-armoured-like-tank.html|title=The car was armored like a tank.

He was burned.&quot; Three other guards being held in separate cells apparently gave similar accounts, leading their captors to believe the accounts of all four to be credible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/31/rebel-forces-surround-gaddafi-town|title=Rebel forces surround Libyan town where Gaddafi is believed to be hiding|date= 31 August 2011|first1=Martin|last1=Chulov|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts of the attack that reportedly killed Gaddafi suggested fire from a [[technical (vehicle)|technical]], rather than a helicopter, destroyed his vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;deathsource&quot;/&gt;

The [[National Transitional Council]] claimed on 4 September that it was now certain Khamis Gaddafi was dead and had been buried near Bani Walid.&lt;ref name=&quot;siege&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14780957|title=Libya conflict: Fear for civilians in Bani Walid siege|work=BBC News|date=4 September 2011|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-September 2011, a report stated that Gaddafi was in Bani Walid, but had left the city and his men to their fate.&lt;ref name=BaniWalid&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/10/gaddafi-beni-walid-rebels-nato|title=Gaddafi's diehard secret police dig in as Nato jets blast desert stronghold|work=The Guardian|date=10 September 2011|first1=Chris|last1=Stephen|first2=Abdul|last2=Raufund|first3=David|last3=Smith|accessdate=15 October 2011|location=Tripoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''[[International Business Times]]'' reported on 15 September that Khamis Gaddafi was still presumed dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/214519/20110915/gadhafi-daughter-hana-gaddafi-alive.htm|work=International Business Times|title=Gadhafi's Mysterious Daughter Hana: Did She Ever Exist?|date=15 September 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October, the Syrian-based pro-Gaddafi TV station [[Arrai TV]] posted a message mourning his death on 29 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE79G01U20111017|title=TV station mourns death of Gaddafi's son Khamis in Libya|publisher=Reuters|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist Robert Worth met with former Tripoli Yarmouk prison captor Marwan Gdoura, who confessed that after the execution of around 100 prisoners he fled the city with some 200 loyalists under the command of Khamis Gaddafi, who was killed in gunbattle. Afterwards, he witnessed his older brother [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] receiving condolences in Bani Walid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/magazine/in-libya-the-captors-have-become-the-captive.html?pagewanted=3 &quot;In Libya, the Captors Have Become the Captive&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2012, a report from Human Rights Watch said &quot;Khamis Gaddafi, a son of Muammar who commanded the elite 32nd &quot;Khamis&quot; Brigade of the Libyan military, was killed on 29 August as he fled Tripoli, in what is believed to have been a NATO airstrike on his convoy.&lt;ref name=hrw12&gt;{{cite web|title=Death of a Dictator|url=http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/libya1012webwcover_0_0.pdf|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=19 December 2012|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one report published after the capture of [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] asserted that the older Gaddafi told interrogators that Khamis Gaddafi was still alive and may be hiding in [[Tarhuna]].&lt;ref name=arraideathsource/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/314862|title=Khamis Gaddafi still alive in Libya, NTC official says |publisher=Digital Journal|date=22 November 2011|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 2012, ''[[Stratfor]]'' reported the capture of Khamis Gaddafi by fighters from Zintan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stratfor.com/situation-report/libya-gadhafi-son-captured|work=Stratfor|title=Gadhafi Son Captured|date=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was denied by the NTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/320232|work=DigitalJournal|title=Khamis Gaddafi's capture baseless rumour, according to NTC|date=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid a [[Siege of Bani Walid (2012)|military campaign against Gaddafi loyalists]] in [[Bani Walid]], the deputy prime minister of Libya claimed in a tweet that Khamis Gaddafi was killed during fighting in the town on 20 October 2012, a year to the day Gaddafi's father Muammar was [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|captured and killed]] by rebel forces in [[Sirte]]. A statement from the Libyan National Congress's spokesman, Omar Hamdan, claimed Gaddafi was killed &quot;in battle&quot;, but gave no further details. His body was purportedly found after a day of heavy fighting between the town's pro-Gaddafi garrison and militias allied to the Libyan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephen|first=Chris|title=Khamis Gaddafi 'killed during fighting in Bani Walid'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/20/khamis-gaddafi-killed-bani-walid-muammar|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=21 October 2012|location=London|date=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youngest son of Colonel Gaddafi dead after Bani Walid siege – Libya deputy PM|url=http://rt.com/news/khamis-gaddafi-libya-captured-874|publisher=Russia Today|date=20 October 2012|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khamis Gaddafi found dead in Beni Walid|url=http://en.trend.az/regions/met/arabicr/2079132.html|publisher=Trend|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cask J.

A government spokesman denied that there was any official confirmation about the capture of Mussa Ibrahim to [[Agence France-Presse]], and did not even talk about the rumor of Khamis Gaddafi's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.timeslive.co.za/africa/?articleId=6966522|work=TimesLIVE Mobile|title=Clashes in Gaddafi bastion kill 26, confusion over former aide's capture|date=21 October 2012|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] described the report of Gaddafi's death as an unconfirmed rumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middle-east/2012/10/21/libyan-turmoil-persists-year-after-gadhafi-death/FVo38xuWBp6DgD2aS06jRI/story.html |title=Libyan turmoil persists year after Gadhafi death |publisher=Boston |date=21 October 2012 |accessdate=19 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124025315/http://www.boston.com/news/world/middle-east/2012/10/21/libyan-turmoil-persists-year-after-gadhafi-death/FVo38xuWBp6DgD2aS06jRI/story.html |archivedate=24 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Musa Ibrahim, the former spokesman of Muammar Gaddafi, personally disproved the message on the arrest saying he was not even in Libya and denied the most recent reports on the death of Khamis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algeria-isp.com/actualites/politique-libye/201210-A12416/libye-declaration-docteur-moussa-ibrahim-octobre-2012.html Statement of Dr. Moussa Ibrahim (20 October 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October, government spokesman Nasser Al-Manaa retracted and apologised for false reports from the government and the National Congress regarding the killing of Gaddafi and the capture of Ibrahim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/10/24/bani-walid-falls/|title=Bani Walid falls|publisher=Libya Herald|date=24 October 2012|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
