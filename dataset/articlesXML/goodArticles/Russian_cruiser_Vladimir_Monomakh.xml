'''''Vladimir Monomakh''''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Мономах}}) was an [[armoured cruiser]] built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] during the 1880s. The vessel was named after [[Vladimir II Monomakh]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]]. She spent most of her career in the [[Far East]], although the ship was in the [[Baltic Sea]] when the [[Russo-Japanese War]] began in 1904. ''Vladimir Monomakh'' was assigned to the Third Pacific Squadron and participated in the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in May 1905. She was tasked to protect the Russian transports and was not heavily engaged during the daylight portion of the battle. The ship was [[torpedo]]ed during the night and was [[scuttled]] the following morning by her captain to prevent her capture by the Japanese.

==Design and description==
''Vladimir Monomakh'' was classified as a semi-[[armored frigate]] and was an improved version of the preceding {{ship|Russian cruiser|Minin||2}}. The ship was designed with high endurance and high speed to facilitate her role as a [[commerce raider]] able to outrun enemy [[battleship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alliluev, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; She was laid out as a [[Central battery ship|central battery ironclad]] with the armament concentrated amidships. The iron-hulled ship was fitted with a [[Naval ram|ram]] and was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce [[biofouling|fouling]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 123–25&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's hull was subdivided by ten transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s and she had a double bottom {{convert|1.73|m|ftin}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;Alliluev, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew numbered approximately 550 officers and men. ''Vladimir Monomakh'' was {{convert|307|ft|9|in|m|1}} [[overall length|long overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|51|ft|10|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|25|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=s9&gt;Silverstone, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; The ship displaced {{convert|5593|LT|MT}} at [[deep load]].&lt;ref name=w68&gt;Watts, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship had two [[Marine steam engine#Compound|vertical compound steam engines]], each driving a four-bladed, manganese-bronze {{convert|18|ft|adj=on}} propeller. Steam was provided by six cylindrical [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s at a pressure of {{convert|70|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The engines produced {{convert|7044|ihp|lk=in}} during [[sea trial]]s which gave the ship a maximum speed around {{convert|15.8|kn|lk=in}}. ''Vladimir Monomakh'' carried {{convert|900|LT|t}}&lt;ref name=w44&gt;Wright, pp. 124–25&lt;/ref&gt; of coal which gave her an economical range of {{convert|6200|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. She was [[ship rig]]ged with three masts&lt;ref name=s9/&gt; and had a total sail area of {{convert|26000|sqft}}. To reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]] while under sail, her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s were retractable.&lt;ref name=w44/&gt;

''Vladimir Monomakh'' was armed with four {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} guns, one at each corner of the [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] that were [[sponson]]ed out over the sides of the hull. Eight of the dozen {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} guns were mounted between the eight-inch guns in the central battery and the remaining four were outside the battery at the ends of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 124, 126&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-[[torpedo boat]] defence was provided by four 9-pounder and ten [[Hotchkiss gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alliluev, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was also equipped with three above-water {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=w44/&gt;

The ship's [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|belt]] was composed of [[compound armour]] and extended the full length of the ship. It was six inches thick amidships, but reduced to {{convert|4.5|in|0}} at the ship's ends. It extended {{convert|2|ft|1}} above the waterline and {{convert|4|ft|1}} below.&lt;ref name=w4&gt;Wright, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Transverse bulkheads {{convert|3|-|4|in|0}} thick protected the guns in the battery from [[raking fire]].&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau and Kolesnik, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; The sponsons of the 8-inch guns were equally thick. The protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|0.5|in|mm|0|adj=on}} thick.&lt;ref name=w4/&gt;

==Career==
Construction began on ''Vladimir Monomakh'' on 22 February 1881 at the [[Baltic Shipyard]] in [[St. Petersburg]], although the formal keel-laying ceremony was not held until 21 May. She was launched on 22 October 1882&lt;ref&gt;Alliluev, pp. 7–8, 11&lt;/ref&gt; and completed on 13 July 1883.&lt;ref name=w7/&gt; The ship's total cost was 3,348,847 [[ruble]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Although the second vessel to be laid down in the ''Dmitri Donskoy'' class, ''Vladimir Monomakh'' was completed first. Due to constant changes during construction, the design of both vessels diverged considerably by the time of completion.&lt;ref name=w7&gt;Watts, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was named after [[Vladimir II Monomakh]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]].&lt;ref name=w4/&gt;

On 11 October 1884, ''Vladimir Monomakh'' began a leisurely voyage from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the Far East. She made port visits in [[Kristiansand]], Norway and [[Portland Harbour]], England before reaching [[Malta]] on 25 November. The ship spent most of the next six weeks in Greek waters before arriving at [[Port Said]], Egypt on 12 January 1885 to transit the [[Suez Canal]]. ''Vladimir Monomakh'' encountered the British [[ironclad]] battleship {{HMS|Agamemnon|1879|6}} there and was followed by her all the way to Japan as tensions were rising between Great Britain and Russia in early 1885. The ship arrived in [[Nagasaki]] in March 1885 and was appointed [[flagship]] of the Russian [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]] under Rear Admiral A.E. Kroun. Based out of [[Vladivostok]], she normally wintered in warmer waters. For example, ''Vladimir Monomakh'' visited [[Manila]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies]] and [[Penang Island]] between November 1885 and March 1886. She returned to [[Kronstadt]] in 1887 and was refitted in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 131, 133, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vladimir Monomakh'' departed Kronstadt for the Mediterranean on 6 November 1889 where she remained for the next year. She joined the official escort for the [[Tsarevich]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]’s visit to the Far East. The Tsarevich travelled aboard the {{ship|Russian cruiser|Pamiat Azova||2}} and ''Vladimir Monomakh'' provided protection. The two ships reached Singapore on 2 March 1891, and reached Vladivostok on 23 May. Once at Vladivostok, Captain [[Oskar Stark]] was appointed commander of the ship and ''Vladimir Monomakh'' was overhauled through August. She wintered over again at Nagasaki, departing for Europe on 23 April 1892 and reached Kronstadt in August, where the ship was given a thorough refit beginning on 22 September. The heavy sailing rig was replaced by three signal masts, her funnels were fixed in place, and her boilers were also upgraded. ''Vladimir Monomakh'' was reclassified as a 1st Class Cruiser on 13 February 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 1894 the ship, now under the command of Captain [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]], was ordered back to the Mediterranean. In view of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–95, the Council of Ministers ordered on 1 February 1895 that the Mediterranean Squadron reinforce the 2nd Pacific Squadron. She reached the Chinese [[treaty port]] of [[Yantai|Chefoo]] on 16 April and became the [[flagship]] of Rear Admiral [[Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev]], 2nd in command of the Pacific Fleet, on 13 May. ''Vladimir Monomakh'' remained at Chefoo until late in the year before sailing to Vladivostok and then to [[Kobe]], Japan in January 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 135–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship only remained there for a short time before she was ordered back to Kronstadt for a major modernization. Her obsolete 8-inch and 6-inch guns were replaced with five new 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] 6-inch and six {{convert|120|mm|adj=on}} [[Canet gun]]s. The ship's six original boilers were replaced by a dozen cylindrical boilers.&lt;ref name=w6&gt;Wright, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vladimir Monomakh'' was transferred back to the Pacific Fleet in November 1897 and reached Nagasaki in February 1898. After the [[Triple Intervention]] expelled the Japanese from [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]], ''Vladimir Monomakh'' was part of the Russian force which subsequently occupied that strategic harbor. In June 1900, she transported troops involved in the suppression of the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In September 1900, on her return to Port Arthur, she accidentally rammed and sank the merchant vessel ''Crown of Aragon''. In December 1901, she rendezvoused with ''Dmitri Donskoy'' at [[Hong Kong]], and the two ships returned to the [[Mediterranean]] via the [[Suez Canal]]. ''Vladimir Monomakh'' remained in the Mediterranean until August 1902, and reached Kronstadt in October. In 1903–04 some of her {{convert|47|mm|adj=on}} Hotchkiss guns were replaced by {{convert|75|mm|adj=on}}.&lt;ref name=w6/&gt;

===Russo-Japanese War===
[[File:Vladimir Monomakh cruiser 02.jpg|thumb|left|''Vladimir Monomakh'' between 1893 and 1905]]
In February 1905, ''Vladimir Monomakh'' was assigned to the Third Pacific Squadron, which was sent to reinforce Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]]'s Second Pacific Squadron. The Third Pacific Squadron transited the Suez Canal and joined the 2nd Pacific Squadron at [[Cam Ranh Bay]] in [[French Indochina]] on 14 May 1905 where they was assigned to the Cruiser Division commanded by Rear Admiral [[Oskar Enkvist]].&lt;ref name=w6/&gt;

At the decisive [[Battle of Tsushima]] on 27 May 1905, ''Vladimir Monomakh'' was positioned to the right side of the Russian [[line of battle]], guarding the transports and so avoided the pounding that the other vessels of Second Pacific Squadron received, although she engaged the Japanese cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Izumi||2}}. The Japanese ship was hit several times and driven off, but only three crewmen were killed and seven wounded. ''Vladimir Monomakh'' was hit several times itself and had one 120&amp;nbsp;mm gun destroyed and its crew killed. The most dangerous hit was a shell that burst over a 6-inch shell hoist and started an ammunition fire. The prompt flooding of the magazine averted an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 136–37&lt;/ref&gt;

At nightfall, the Japanese torpedo boats engaged the surviving Russian warships and the cruiser claimed to have sunk one of her attackers at 8:25 p.m. ''Vladimir Monomakh'', mistaking one of her attackers for a Russian destroyer, was hit around 8:40 by a single torpedo which ruptured her hull near the No. 2 coal bunker, but sank the torpedo boat. The damage was severe but her crew kept her afloat and her engines operational, although she continued to take on water. The next morning, however, ''Vladimir Monomakh'' headed towards [[Tsushima Island]] and began to unload her wounded into her surviving boats. Captain Vladimir Aleksandrovich Popov gave the order to abandon ship, and ordered the [[seacock]]s to be opened to scuttle the vessel rather than surrender it to the Japanese. The ship sank at 10:20 a.m. and the crew was captured by the Japanese auxiliary cruisers {{SS|Sado Maru}} and {{SS|Manchu Maru}}. ''Vladimir Monomakh'' was officially removed from the [[navy list]] on 28 September 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 137–38&lt;/ref&gt;
