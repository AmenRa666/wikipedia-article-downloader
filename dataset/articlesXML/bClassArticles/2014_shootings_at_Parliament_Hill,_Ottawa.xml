&lt;!--don't repeat merely descriptive title of article here; see [[WP:REDUNDANCY]]--&gt;A series of shootings occurred on October 22, 2014, at [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]]. At the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|Canadian National War Memorial]], Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a [[Canadian Army|Canadian soldier]] on [[Ceremonial Guard#Sentry duty|ceremonial sentry]] duty. He then entered the nearby [[Centre Block]] parliament building, where members of the [[Parliament of Canada]] were attending [[caucus]]es. After wrestling with a constable at the entrance, Zehaf-Bibeau ran inside and had a shootout with parliament security personnel.  He was shot 31 times by six officers and died at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/garbled-radio-call-delayed-police-response-to-parliament-hill-attacker-rcmp-1.2403906 ctvnews.ca: &quot;Garbled radio call delayed police response to Parliament Hill attacker: RCMP&quot;], 3 Jun 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=opp&gt;{{cite report|title=Independent Investigation Into the Death of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/about/house/newsroom/articles/2015-06-03-Report-e.pdf|accessdate=29 July 2015|publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|date=22 October 2014|isbn=978-0-660-02415-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parlsumm&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/about/house/newsroom/articles/2015-06-03-Summary-e.pdf parl.gc.ca: &quot;October 22, 2014 House of Commons Incident Response Summary&quot;], 3 Jun 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Following the shootings, the [[Downtown Ottawa|downtown core of Ottawa]] was placed on [[wikt:lockdown|lockdown]] while police searched for any potential additional threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ottawa-shooting-deadly-attacks-force-canada-to-face-up-to-global-terror-threat-9814811.html  |title=Ottawa shooting: Deadly attacks force Canada to face up to a global terror threat |first=Tim |last=Walker |work=The Independent |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) investigation into the shootings is ongoing.&lt;ref name=rcmp-oct27/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/autopsies-underway-after-ottawa-gun-rampage |title=Autopsies underway after Ottawa gun rampage |date=October 23, 2014 |work=Ottawa Citizen |first=Robert |last=Bostelaar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was a 32-year-old Canadian [[habitual offender]] and [[substance dependence|drug addict]] from Montreal. Considered by several acquaintances to have mental issues, he had been observed by acquaintances and [[mosque]] staff exhibiting erratic behaviour. Zehaf-Bibeau, who had a Libyan-Canadian father, had [[Religious conversion|converted]] to [[Islam]] in 2004 and visited Libya. At the time of the shooting, Zehaf-Bibeau planned to leave Canada for the Middle East, living in a [[homeless shelter]] in Ottawa while waiting for the processing of his Canadian passport application. According to RCMP Commissioner [[Bob Paulson]] the &quot;passport issue was central to what was driving&quot; Zehaf-Bibeau.&lt;ref name=developed/&gt; Zehaf-Bibeau made a video prior to the attack in which he expressed his motives as being related &quot;to Canada's foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs.&quot;&lt;ref name=wrr/&gt; To acquaintances and co-workers, he had previously expressed support for jihadists and others in the Middle East resisting the West's intervention, but was not known to the police to be a terrorism risk. In his mother's opinion, the attack was the &quot;last desperate act&quot; of someone with a [[mental disorder]] who felt trapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=National Post |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/10/25/michael-zehaf-bibeau-mother-says-killing-was-last-desperate-act-of-a-mentally-ill-person/ |title=Ottawa shooting by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was ‘last desperate act’ of a mentally ill person, his mother writes |first=Douglas |last=Quan| date=October 25, 2014 |accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two incidents, which attracted international attention, raised concerns about the effectiveness of police actions to prevent terrorist attacks, the prevention of radicalization and the security measures in place at federal and provincial legislatures. The Canadian government had already prepared a bill to expand the powers and courtroom anonymity and surveillance powers of the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS), Canada's spy agency, which was due to be introduced the day of the shootings, and was postponed by the event. The government introduced new anti-terrorism measures with the ''[[Anti-terrorism Act, 2015]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csis-powers-beefed-up-under-new-bill-tabled-by-steven-blaney-1.2814314 |title=CSIS powers beefed up under new bill tabled by Steven Blaney |first=Mas |last=Susana |date=October 27, 2014 |accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security at Parliament Hill is to be stepped up.

==Background==
On October 20, in the [[2014 Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu ramming attack]], Martin Couture-Rouleau attacked two [[Canadian Armed Forces]] soldiers. Rouleau was a 25-year-old [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] who became a [[Muslim]] [[Religious conversion|convert]] in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/22/us-canada-attacks-suspect-idUSKCN0IB2IX20141022 |title=Canada probes Michael Zehaf-Bibeau as possible suspect in Ottawa shooting: source|work=Reuters |accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a supporter of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |first1=Mark |last1=Gollom |first2=Tracey |last2=Lindeman |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/who-is-martin-couture-rouleau-1.2807285 |title=Who is Martin Couture-Rouleau? |date=October 22, 2014 |publisher= |accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rouleau used his car to [[hit and run|run down]] the two soldiers before being fatally shot by police after an ensuing car chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=National Post|last1=Bell|first1=Stewart|title=‘He seemed like a typical and fairly boring convert': Inside Martin Rouleau’s rapid descent to extremism |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/10/21/he-seemed-like-a-typical-and-fairly-boring-convert-inside-martin-rouleaus-rapid-decent-to-extremism/ |accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the soldiers, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, age 53, subsequently died from his injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;

The terror threat level in Canada was on October 21 raised to medium in light of Vincent's death and due to &quot;an increase in online 'general chatter' from radical groups including Islamic State and al-Qaeda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=BBC News |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29722094|title=Canada lifts terror threat level from low to medium|date=October 22, 2014 |accessdate=October 22, 2014 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his address to the nation following the shootings on October 22, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] referred to the October 20 incident as an ISIL-inspired terrorist attack.&lt;ref name=cbc-pols/&gt; Although both the October 20 and 22 attacks led to the death of Canadian soldiers, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) has ruled out any direct connection between the events of October 20 and 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bnd.com/2014/10/23/3470864_canadian-police-no-link-between.html?rh=1 |agency=Associated Press |title=Canadian police: no link between soldier attacks |date=October 23, 2014 |work=BND |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024050638/http://www.bnd.com/2014/10/23/3470864_canadian-police-no-link-between.html?rh=1 |archivedate=October 24, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shootings==

===National War Memorial===
[[File:Ottawa War Memorial Sentries.jpg|thumb|Nathan Cirillo was on sentry duty at the National War Memorial, similar to the sentries in this picture, when he was fatally shot.]]
Shortly before 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[UTC−04:00|EDT]], on October 22, 2014, witnesses saw Zehaf-Bibeau arrive at the National War Memorial carrying a rifle, which was later identified as a .30–30 [[Winchester Model 1894|Winchester Model 94]] lever-action hunting rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/23/canada-police-ottawa-gunman-video-passport-motive|first=Lauren |last=Gambino|title=Canadian police release video of Ottawa parliament gunman during attack|newspaper=The Guardian|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dressed in blue jeans and a black jacket, with a [[Palestinian keffiyeh|keffiyeh]] scarf over the lower part of his face.&lt;ref name=oc-picture/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/22/us-canada-attacks-shooting-idUSKCN0IB1PY20141022 |title=Canada's Parliament attacked near where prime minister was speaking, Harper safe |work=Reuters |date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He approached Corporal Nathan Cirillo of [[The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)]], who was one of three [[wikt:sentry|sentries]] from the [[Ceremonial Guard]] posted at the [[Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]]. At close range, Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cirillo twice in the back,&lt;ref name=post-chase/&gt; fatally wounding him. Cirillo, like all others who have stood sentry at the memorial, carried an unloaded firearm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/soldier-shot-at-war-memorial-in-ottawa |title=UPDATE: Day of chaos in the capital leaves soldier and terrorist dead|first=Andrew |last=Duffy |work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only minutes before the end of the sentries' shift, which ended at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=macleans-20141230&gt;{{cite news |work=Macleans |title=Bearing witness: New voices recall the Ottawa shooting |url=http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/bearing-witness-new-voices-recall-the-ottawa-shooting/ |first=Julie |last=Smyth |date=December 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cpl. Kyle Button and Cpl. Branden Stevenson, two other soldiers on sentry duty, attempted to stop Zehaf-Bibeau, but they were shot at by him and forced to flee to the other side of the Memorial.&lt;ref name=macleans-20141230/&gt; Zehaf-Bibeau then pulled down his scarf, held his rifle one-handedly over his head and yelled, &quot;For Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/gunman-yelled-for-iraq-ottawa-shooting-eyewitness-1.2810689 |title=Gunman yelled 'For Iraq:' Ottawa shooting eyewitness |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cpl.

Meanwhile, Zehaf-Bibeau returned to his vehicle, a small grey Toyota car, which was parked on the south side of [[Wellington Street (Ottawa)|Wellington Street]] behind the memorial, and drove west along Wellington a short distance to Parliament Hill, where he abandoned his vehicle. Past scattering bystanders, he ran through a gate in the fence surrounding the Parliament Hill precinct and carjacked a parliamentary vehicle assigned to [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]], which he drove to the Centre Block parliament building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Glen McGregor |author2=David Reevely |author3=Dean Tweed |author4=Dennis Leung |url=https://postmediaottawacitizen2.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/1023shootingupdate-gr.jpg |title=Terror in the Capital |publisher=''Ottawa Citizen'' |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RCMP officers on patrol in the precinct witnessed the carjacking and pursued the vehicle to the base of the [[Peace Tower]].&lt;ref name=post-chase /&gt;

A photograph of Zehaf-Bibeau was taken by a tourist at the war memorial during the shootings.&lt;ref name=oc-picture/&gt; It shows him holding the rifle and wearing a scarf over part of his face, with part of the War Memorial behind him. Ottawa police seized the camera and then took their own photograph of the image using a cellphone. French-Canadian journalist William Reymond received a copy of the photograph via the Internet, anonymously, apparently a copy of a tweet originating from the Ottawa Police of the cellphone picture. Reymond then took a picture of the image as it was displayed on his computer monitor and posted it to Twitter a few hours later after confirming the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=National Post |title=First photo of Ottawa gunman taken by tourist who witnessed shooting at National War Memorial, sources say |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/10/24/first-photo-of-ottawa-gunman-taken-by-tourist-who-witnessed-shooting-at-national-war-memorial-sources-say/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image was re-tweeted by an ISIL sympathizer, leading to erroneous media reports that the image originated from an ISIL Twitter account.&lt;ref name=oc-picture/&gt;

===Parliament buildings===
[[File:Hall of Honour-Centre Block-Ottawa.jpg|thumb|left|The Hall of Honour in the [[Centre Block]], where Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was killed in an exchange of gunfire]]
Zehaf-Bibeau entered the Centre Block through the main entrance under the Peace Tower, where Samearn Son was one of two constables on duty. Son saw the rifle in Zehaf-Bibeau's hand, immediately grabbed it, and pulled it towards the floor while yelling, &quot;Gun! Gun! Gun!&quot; In the ensuing struggle, Son was shot in the foot and had to let go of the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-shooting-michael-zehaf-bibeau-s-movements-revealed-by-security-video-1.2810673 |title=Ottawa shooting: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's movements revealed by security video |work=[[CBC News]]|date=October 23, 2014 |accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other RCMP officers converged on Zehaf-Bibeau, Son limped out of the building and calmly told a CBC reporter outside, &quot;I will survive.&quot;&lt;ref name=cbc-reconstruct&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |title=Ottawa shooting: Reconstructing the Centre Block shootout |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-shooting-reconstructing-the-centre-block-shootout-1.2821338 |first=Terry |last=Milewski}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just inside the Centre Block, Zehaf-Bibeau exchanged gunfire with security personnel and was wounded.&lt;ref name=cbc-dec-1/&gt;

Zehaf-Bibeau then ran along the Hall of Honour corridor toward the Library of Parliament. Pursued by RCMP officers, he passed, on his left, the door to a committee room in which Stephen Harper and the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) were meeting. Directly opposite was the door to another [[Caucus#In Commonwealth nations|caucus]] room, where [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|leader of the opposition]], [[Thomas Mulcair]], and [[New Democratic Party]] MPs were gathered. (The Liberals, as the third party, were holding their caucus meeting in a chamber downstairs.) During the shooting, one bullet penetrated the outer doors to the NDP caucus room.&lt;ref name=cbc-dec-1/&gt; Inside their room, NDP MPs dove for cover. Across the hall, Harper was hidden in a closet while Conservative MPs made a barricade at the doors, grabbing flagpoles to use as rudimentary spears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Chase |title=MPs fashioned spears while Harper whisked into closet |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-attack-mps-fashioned-spears-while-harper-hid-in-closet/article21278580|accessdate=October 23, 2014 |work=[[The Globe &amp; Mail]] |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=veryproud/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Local MPs talk about the shooting on Parliament Hill |url=http://barrie.ctvnews.ca/local-mp-s-talk-about-the-shooting-on-parliament-hill-1.2065635 |accessdate=October 22, 2014 |work=[[CKVR-DT|CTV News Barrie]] |date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ottawa shooting: N.L.

Zehaf-Bibeau grew up in Eastern Canada, including Ottawa and Montreal.&lt;ref name=freeze /&gt; His mother is Susan Bibeau, a [[French-Canadian]] Quebecer from Montreal and deputy chairperson of a division of [[Immigration and Refugee Board|Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board]]. His father is a businessman, Bulgasem Zehaf,&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; a [[Libya]]n immigrant to Quebec who opened the Tripoli café in Montreal. Zehaf is reported to have fought in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War]];&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;freeze&quot;/&gt; the ''[[Washington Times]]'' reported that Mr. Zehaf had returned to his hometown of Zawiyah in Libya to join the uprising against the [[Muammar Gaddafi]] regime. The couple split up before Zehaf-Bibeau's birth, but reconciled a short while after and were married.&lt;ref name=star-1027/&gt; Zehaf and Bibeau divorced in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;/&gt; After the divorce, Zehaf-Bibeau was removed from a private school with strict discipline and put in a secondary school known for pupils fighting with other students from local schools.&lt;ref name=dm-exclusive/&gt; Zehaf-Bibeau continued to live in the Montreal area until 2007, when he spent time in Libya before moving to Western Canada to become a miner and labourer.&lt;ref name=freeze /&gt;

Zehaf-Bibeau became a [[habitual offender]] with an extensive criminal record for several offences, including [[larceny]], [[drug possession]], and [[parole]] violations. He had received several criminal convictions, at least one of which resulted in a [[custodial sentence]] of 60 days' [[incarceration]].&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; In November 2001, just after his 19th birthday, he was convicted of possessing a false credit card and impaired driving.&lt;ref name=np-4/&gt; In 2004, he pleaded guilty to drug possession for [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[Phencyclidine|PCP]]. He failed to appear at the trial date in 2006, but appeared three years later to plead guilty to marijuana possession and was given a discharge. In 2011, he was charged with [[robbery]] and &quot;uttering threats&quot; in [[Vancouver]], but only convicted of the lesser charge of uttering threats.&lt;ref name=criminal&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/michael-zehaf-bibeau-slain-ottawa-shooter-had-criminal-record-in-quebec-b-c-1.2809562 |title=Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, slain Ottawa shooter, had criminal record in Quebec, B.C. |work=[[CBC News]] |date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that he committed the 2011 robbery so that he would be incarcerated, in order to kick his drug habit.

Zehaf-Bibeau arrived in Ottawa on or before October 2, ostensibly to pursue securing a passport. Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a [[Canadian passport]] and a [[background check]] was in progress.

That document had expired, and Zehaf-Bibeau told officials that he wanted a new passport so he could visit family and friends in Libya.&lt;ref name=cbc-libyan-passport/&gt;

===Before the shootings===
Zehaf-Bibeau had been staying at the Ottawa Mission, a [[homeless shelter]] in Ottawa near Parliament Hill. According to other residents of the mission, Zehaf-Bibeau and two other men had been trying to get a vehicle. Others said of Zehaf-Bibeau and the other two men, &quot;You knew they were up to something shifty, pacing around a lot and everything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |title=Shooter Zehaf-Bibeau was staying at Ottawa Mission before rampage: witnesses |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/shooter-zehaf-bibeau-was-staying-at-ottawa-mission-before-rampage-witnesses |first=David |last=Henderson |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle used by Zehaf-Bibeau was purchased one day before the shootings.&lt;ref name=&quot;post-chase&quot;/&gt; One resident of the mission noted that Zehaf-Bibeau's mood had changed three days before the attacks, and he attributed it to Zehaf-Bibeau going back on drugs. Zehaf-Bibeau reportedly told the other residents that he was &quot;anti-Canadian&quot; and to pray because &quot;the world is ending&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-shooting-michael-zehaf-bibeau-not-among-90-being-probed-rcmp-say-1.2810113 |title=Ottawa shooting: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau not among 90 being probed, RCMP say |first=Dean |last=Beeby |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another resident reported that Zehaf-Bibeau had shown a lot of interest in the Parliament buildings, including asking how easy was it to get into the Parliament buildings.&lt;ref name=post-1113/&gt;

A day before the attack, multiple witnesses saw Zehaf-Bibeau engaged in a &quot;heated discussion&quot; with another man while waiting to register his purchase of the vehicle used in the shootings. According to a witness, Zehaf-Bibeau said &quot;If soldiers bombed your family, wouldn’t you want to kill them?&quot;. Staff in the registry office asked him to lower his voice or leave. The purchase was disallowed by the office because of his out-of-province identification. The purchase was never registered and Zehaf-Bibeau pasted a piece of junk mail on the car to mimic a temporary license permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/shooter-was-overheard-talking-about-bombings-civilian-deaths |title=Shooter was overheard talking about bombings, killing civilians |first=Glen |last=McGregor |work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How Zehaf-Bibeau obtained his gun has not been determined.&lt;ref name=ctv/&gt; At the time of the shootings, Zehaf-Bibeau was legally prohibited from possessing or acquiring firearms.&lt;ref name=GunControlFailure/&gt; Additionally, his previous criminal charges and convictions, history of drug abuse, and lack of a fixed address all would have prevented him from receiving a [[Possession and Acquisition Licence|Canadian Firearms Licence]].&lt;ref name=GunControlFailure/&gt; A knife that Zehaf-Bibeau had with him on October 22 was determined to have originated from a relative's home.&lt;ref name=ctv/&gt;

===After the shootings===
On November 15, it was reported that Zehaf-Bibeau's body had remained at the Ottawa coroner's office for examination. According to the procedure to be followed by the coroner, the examination must report the entry and exit wound of each gunshot wound, and a toxicology report. After the examination is complete, his remains must be buried according to Islamic convention. The issue of accepting his body for an eventual funeral was problematic for the Ottawa Muslim Association mosque: &quot;while denouncing what he did as a crime, a terrorist attack against a soldier who was serving the country, we say that if he's believing in God, if he's a Muslim, then he should be buried,&quot; said imam Samy Metwally. &quot;We will give him a funeral service.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/michael-zehaf-bibeau-s-remains-still-being-examined-at-coroner-s-office-1.2836394 |title=Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's remains still being examined at coroner's office |first=Evan |last=Dyer |date=November 15, 2014 |accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on November 18, the coroner in an interview announced that the body was released &quot;over a week ago&quot;.

==Aftermath==

===Ottawa===
Ottawa's downtown core was put under [[lockdown]] while a search began for a potential second shooter.&lt;ref name=Star /&gt; Buildings under lockdown included Canada's parliament, the [[University of Ottawa]] and the [[Embassy of the United States, Ottawa|United States embassy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC live&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;M breaking&quot; /&gt; Initially, police reported a third shooting had taken place near the [[Rideau Centre]] mall at the same time. A few hours later, police corrected this mistaken report, stating that only two shootings took place.&lt;ref name=Star/&gt; [[File:Ottawa-shootings-map.png|thumb|left|The locations of the two shooting incidents: 1. the war memorial, 2. the Centre Block]]

At a press conference at 14:00, Ottawa police confirmed Cirillo's death without using his name, pending notification of his family. The RCMP confirmed Zehaf-Bibeau's death, without his name or any other details, citing the ongoing investigation. The National Defence headquarters, the parliament buildings and other government facilities remained in lockdown while a search of the area took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-shooting-soldier-dies-of-injuries-gunman-also-shot-dead-1.2808710 |title=Ottawa shooting: Soldier dies of injuries, gunman also shot dead|publisher=[[CBC News]] |first=Dean |last=Beeby |date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas around Parliament Hill including a mall and a university remained closed for hours with buildings in lockdown, with police searching buildings room by room for shooters. Police lifted the lockdown on all public schools in and around Ottawa's downtown core at around 5:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.  Parliament Hill remained under lockdown until well past 21:00 and, even after MPs and staffers were allowed to leave the Centre Block, streets directly adjacent to Parliament Hill and the National War Memorial remained closed to the public the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Ottawa Sun |url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/10/22/much-of-downtown-ottawa-in-lockdown-after-parliament-hill-shooting |title=Road closures, Parliament Hill still closed to public: Cops |first1=Danielle |last=Bell |first2=Doug |last2=Hempstead |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament Hill reopened to the public on October 24, and Parliament Buildings tours resumed on October 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/10/25/parliament_hill_again_open_to_the_public_tours_to_resume_monday.html |title=Parliament Hill again open to the public; tours to resume Monday |author =Canadian Press |date=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and government response==
Initially, the [[Ottawa Police Service]] (OPS) said they were investigating the shooting at the war memorial, while the RCMP was investigating the shooting at Centre Block.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;M breaking&quot; /&gt; However, on October 23, the OPS announced that the shooting had been declared a matter of national security and, as such, the entire investigation would be turned over to the RCMP. It was also announced that the RCMP had in turn asked the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] (OPP) to conduct a standard independent investigation into the response of police and security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-shooting-rcmp-takes-over-investigation-opp-to-probe-police-conduct-1.2813339 |title=Ottawa shooting: RCMP takes over investigation, OPP to probe police conduct |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OPP to lead independent probe of Parliament Hill security|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/opp-to-lead-independent-probe-of-parliament-hill-security-1.2071640|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCMP on October 23 released security video showing Zehaf-Bibeau's movements across the Parliament Hill precinct. They also announced that Zehaf-Bibeau was not one of 93 suspected extremists on a RCMP high-risk traveller list, though email written by Zehaf-Bibeau had been found on a computer belonging to an unnamed individual charged with terrorism offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CTV News |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/rcmp-show-dramatic-security-video-of-gunman-behind-ottawa-shootings-1.2068134 |title=RCMP show dramatic security video of gunman behind Ottawa shootings |first=Andrea |last=Janus |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting, RCMP Commissioner Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau's mother had told the RCMP that he wanted to go to Syria, but she denied this, stating that, in a recorded interview, she had told the RCMP that he had wanted to go to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=reuters-oct26/&gt;

It was announced by the RCMP on October 26 that they had &quot;persuasive evidence&quot; showing Zehaf-Bibeau's attack had been &quot;driven by ideological and political motives.&quot;&lt;ref name=ctv/&gt; According to the RCMP, Zehaf-Bibeau had recorded a video of himself prior to the attack in which, Commissioner Paulson alleged that &quot;[Zehaf-Bibeau] was quite deliberate, he was quite lucid and he was quite purposeful in articulating the basis for his actions. They were in respect, broadly, to Canada's foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs.&quot; The RCMP did not release the video, which they said they were studying for &quot;its intelligence and evidence value&quot;, but Paulson said they hoped to release it eventually.&lt;ref name=wrr/&gt;

Paulson appeared before a parliamentary committee on October 27 to brief MPs. &quot;While we are facing this threat at home, we must focus our efforts on preventing individuals traveling abroad to commit acts of terrorism. Preventing the individuals from traveling is critical. If these individuals return with training and/or battle experience, they pose an even greater threat to Canada and our allies.&quot;&lt;ref name=reuters-oct27&gt;{{cite news |title=Canada must do more to rein in threat from radicals: police head |url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN0IF0OE20141027?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |accessdate=October 27, 2014 |work=Reuters |date=October 27, 2014 |first1=Randall |last1=Palmer |first2=David |last2=Ljunggren |first3=Richard |last3=Valdmanis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That day, the government, after delay caused by the shootings, introduced a bill to broaden the powers of the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS). Among other powers, it would allow the agency to operate internationally and introduce a program to revoke Canadian citizenship of dual nationals who are convicted of terrorism.&lt;ref name=reuters-oct27/&gt; The [[Canadian Civil Liberties Association]] urged the government to not over-react: &quot;before we take steps to expand existing police and intelligence power, we need answers about why the power that we have were not used, or were insufficient, to prevent or avoid recent tragedies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccla.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014-10-27-Open-Letter-to-Members-of-Parliament.pdf |first=Sukanya |last=Pillay |title=Open Letter to Members of Parliament |date=October 27, 2014 |accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 29, [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] [[Peter MacKay]] said the government would work to prevent the promotion of terrorism online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Global News |title=Thomas Mulcair says Ottawa gunman was a criminal, but not a terrorist |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1642555/thomas-mulcair-says-ottawa-gunman-was-a-criminal-but-not-a-terrorist/ |date=October 29, 2014 |agency=Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media reported on November 13 that security video taken at the Centre Block parliament building showed that Zehaf-Bibeau had taken a tour of the  building three weeks before the attack. The security video was not released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CTV News |date=November 13, 2014 |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/gunman-in-ottawa-attack-had-toured-parliament-1.2100761 |title=Gunman in Ottawa attack had toured Parliament }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large knife was found next to Zehaf-Bibeau's body after he was killed, and it was reported that the RCMP's working theory of his actions was that he intended to behead someone.&lt;ref name=post-1113/&gt;

On November 23, the government announced that they would unify the various security forces of the House of Commons and the Senate under one command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |title='Unified security force' to patrol Parliament Hill following Ottawa shooting |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/unified-security-force-to-patrol-parliament-hill-following-ottawa-shooting-1.2849932 |date=November 24, 2014 |accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the two separate forces had been identified as a point of failure in the October 22 incident. Other areas suggested to be addressed was the need for better surveillance equipment including a central surveillance officer, and a lack of networking between the forces, including the RCMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/attack-on-parliament-exposed-systemic-security-gaps-says-ex-jtf2-commander-1.2840770 |title=Attack on Parliament exposed 'systemic' security gaps, says ex-JTF2 commander |date=November 19, 2014 |first=Terry |last=Milewski |accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, RCMP Commissioner Paulson said the RCMP would not release the video of Zehaf-Bibeau's alleged motives. Members of Parliament had called for its release, stating that he should not comment on it without releasing it for public discussion. Paulson said releasing a partial transcript was possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/rcmp-may-not-release-zehaf-bibeau-video-commissioner |title=Hill gunman was wounded just moments before fatal shootout |first1=Dylan |last1=Robertson |first2=Jordan |last2=Press |date=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, CBC News reported that Centre Block security video showed that Zehaf-Bibeau had been shot once in an exchange of gunfire with Commons security before running along the Hall of Honour towards the Library of Parliament.&lt;ref name=cbc-dec-1/&gt; On December 3, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', ''[[National Post]]'' and ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' major newspapers called for the videos to be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=National Post |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/12/03/full-pundit-julian-fantinos-long-goodbye/ |title=Full Pundit: Julian Fantino’s long goodbye |first=Chris |last=Selley |date=December 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press |author =Editorial |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/editorials/public-eyes-on-parliament-shooting-284573631.html |title=Public eyes on Parliament shooting |date=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, Prime Minister Harper suggested that the attacker may not have been acting alone, but did not elaborate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Reuters |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/17/us-canada-attacks-idUSKBN0JV2WT20141217?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews |title=Canada PM says Parliament attacker may not have been lone wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on national television, Harper would not confirm he was hidden in a closet during the shootings, but said his first concern was to extricate himself from the location. &quot;All you hear is a whole lot of shooting coming towards you, and you don't know if that's a firefight or whether it's just a bunch of guys with automatic weapons wiping everybody out in their path.&quot; After the incident, Harper's first call was to his mother to reassure her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=CBC News |date=December 17, 2014 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-says-rcmp-training-prepared-him-for-oct-22-attack-1.2876904 |title=Stephen Harper says RCMP training prepared him for Oct. 22 attack }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario Provincial Police started two further investigations into the incident. After October 22, the OPP started a review of the RCMP actions on Parliament Hill. On October 29, the House of Commons Speaker asked the OPP to review the conduct of House of Commons constables. On November 24, the RCMP asked the OPP to review Zehaf-Bibeau's actions from the Memorial to Parliament Hill. The RCMP will then act on revising its security after the reviews are complete. Until that time, the RCMP has increased its numbers around Parliament by rotating new officers for two-month terms to Parliament Hill security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Globe and Mail |title=Ontario police asked to start third probe into Parliament Hill shooting |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ontario-police-asked-to-start-third-probe-into-parliament-hill-shooting/article22197472/ |date=December 24, 2014 |first1=Josh |last1=Wingrove |first2=Daniel |last2=Leblanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2015, the Canadian House of Commons public safety committee passed a motion to invite RCMP Commissioner Paulson to &quot;publicly display and discuss the video&quot; that Zehaf-Bibeau recorded at a future meeting of the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |title=Ottawa shooting: MPs invite RCMP to 'publicly' show Zehaf-Bibeau video |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-shooting-mps-invite-rcmp-to-publicly-show-zehaf-bibeau-video-1.2960445 |date=February 24, 2015 |accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioner Paulson showed the video (minus 18 seconds which the RCMP said might be pertinent to investigations into accomplices) at the public safety committee meeting of March 6. Zehaf-Bibeau is quoted as saying: &quot;This is in retaliation for Afghanistan and because Harper [Prime Minister Stephen Harper] wants to send his troops to Iraq. Canada's officially become one of our enemies by fighting and bombing us and creating a lot of terror in our countries and killing us and killing our innocents. So, just aiming to hit some soldiers just to show that you're not even safe in your own land, and you gotta be careful. We'll not cease until you guys decide to be a peaceful country and stay to your own and stop going to other countries and stop occupying and killing the righteous of us who are trying to bring back religious law in our countries. Thank you.&quot; The video was recorded in the car, in Ottawa, on the day of the shootings and was found in the car abandoned in front of Parliament. Paulson said he believes that someone else was involved, and if they were found to have aided Zehaf-Bibeau, that they would be charged with terrorism offences. Paulson also said a post-mortem test for drugs and alcohol on Zehaf-Bibeau was negative and that he had a long knife tied to his wrist when he was killed by Parliament Hill security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |title=Michael Zehaf-Bibeau warns in video: 'You gotta be careful' |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/michael-zehaf-bibeau-warns-in-video-you-gotta-be-careful-1.2984170 |date=March 6, 2015 |first=Laura |last=Payton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulson further briefed Parliament that the RCMP has over 130 full-time investigators and staff on the case. Paulson reiterated the RCMP's position that Zehaf-Bibeau was a terrorist under Section 83.01 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], and that he would have been charged with terrorism offences had he survived. OPP investigators also possess the security video taken inside the Parliament building when Zehaf-Bibeau was killed. The RCMP did not determine the source of the gun Zehaf-Bibeau used. They found witnesses to him loading it into his car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |title=6 things we learned about Michael Zehaf-Bibeau and Parliament Hill shooting |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/6-things-we-learned-about-michael-zehaf-bibeau-and-parliament-hill-shooting-1.2984759 |date=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 2015, the RCMP released the full transcript of Zehaf-Bibeau's video. The missing 18 seconds included Zehaf-Bibeau asking God to praise his actions and curse those he is targeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Full transcript of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau video released |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/05/29/full-transcript-of-michael-zehaf-bibeau-video-released.html |date=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the CBC reported some information from the OPP report. The CBC reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was hit 31 times by police including a shot to the back of the head by RCMP Constable Curtis Barrett after which the RCMP stopped firing. He was then hand-cuffed although he was already dead. Vickers himself shot 15 times. After entering the Centre Block, there was an exchange of gunfire between Zehaf-Bibeau and House of Commons Security Corporal Malo. Zehaf-Bibeau then ran down the Hall of Honour. House of Commons Security Constable Louis Letourneau shot at Zehaf-Bibeau 15 times, hitting him once, an event recorded on Centre Block security video. Four RCMP officers advanced on Zehaf-Bibeau, who took one more shot, narrowly missing RCMP Constable Barrett, then started a barrage at Zehaf-Bibeau. The OPP report concluded that the officers' actions were all justified.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc-15-06-01&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |title=Ottawa gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was shot 31 times, police report to reveal |date=June 1, 2015 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-gunman-michael-zehaf-bibeau-was-shot-31-times-police-report-to-reveal-1.3096073 |first=Evan |last=Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OPP report also contained the information that it was determined that Zehaf-Bibeau shot Corporal Cirillo three times in the back at the War Memorial, not twice as was previously reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc-15-06-01&quot;/&gt;

In October 2015, CTV News reported that it had obtained an &quot;unredacted&quot; copy of the OPP report. In it, it was reported that four RCMP officers were involved in the shootout: Const. Curtis Barrett, Const. Martin Fraser, Sgt. Rick Rozon and Corp. Dany Daigle. According to CTV News, the constables were told after Kevin Vickers was applauded for his actions that &quot;the Kevin Vickers train has left the station but you guys will get internal recognition.&quot; Recognition was to include a commissioner’s commendation and recommendation for a Governor General’s Award. According to CTV, the officers did not receive commendations and were on stress leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CTV News |author =CTVNews.ca staff |title=Mounties who helped end Parliament Hill attack still not recognized |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/mounties-who-helped-end-parliament-hill-attack-still-not-recognized-1.2608529 |date=October 13, 2015 |accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the war memorial was reopened to the public, a makeshift memorial to Cirillo grew in front of it; residents laid out flowers, cards, and wreaths.

Considerable media attention was paid to the ideology and pathology of Zehaf-Bibeau.

There has also been criticism of the government's labelling the shooting as a terrorist attack.

A national poll by the Angus Reid organization released on November 25, 2014 revealed that Canadians in general were also split as well on whether the attack and shooting was an act of terrorism or mental illness. 38% felt that it was the result of mental illness, while 36% felt it was terrorism, with 25% undecided. Asked about what the federal government should do as a result, 54% felt that more initiatives should be done to prevent radicalization, while 34% favoured harsher punishments. On how to deal with homegrown terrorists, 54% felt that indefinite incarceration only motivated persons to commit crimes, while 46% felt it prevented violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Angus Reid |url=http://angusreid.org/homegrown-terrorism-radicalization-canada-overblown-serious-threat/#II |title=Attack on Parliament Hill: terrorism or mental illness?

President [[Barack Obama]] was briefed about the attacks. The [[White House]] released a statement that read: &quot;President Obama condemned these outrageous attacks, and reaffirmed the close friendship and alliance between our people.&quot;&lt;ref name=obama /&gt; In the following week, [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] made a visit to Ottawa, which included laying a wreath at the National War Memorial in honour of the soldier killed.

[[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service|Pulitzer Prize]]-winning American journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] said in a column on ''[[The Intercept]]'' that the Canadian government was exploiting the shootings by, wasting, &quot;no time in seizing on the incident to promote its fear-mongering agenda over terrorism, which includes pending legislation to vest its intelligence agency, CSIS, with more spying and secrecy powers in the name of fighting ISIS.&quot; He also said that the shootings weren't an act of terrorism, writing that, &quot;...to the extent the term [terrorism] has any common understanding, it includes the deliberate (or wholly reckless) targeting of civilians with violence for political ends. But in this case in Canada, it wasn’t civilians who were targeted. If one believes the government’s accounts of the incident, the driver waited two hours until he saw a soldier in uniform. In other words, he seems to have ''deliberately avoided attacking civilians'', and targeted a soldier instead – a member of a military that is currently fighting a war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/22/canada-proclaiming-war-12-years-shocked-someone-attacked-soldiers/ |title=Canada, at War for 13 Years, Shocked That 'A Terrorist' Attacked Its Soldiers |first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |publisher=The Intercept |date=October 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporter Jacob Siegel of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' suggested that the attacks by Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were connected with the [[2014 New York City hatchet attack]]. Like them, the New York attacker was labelled as a &quot;lone wolf,&quot; although Siegel writes that those who are moved from anger to spontaneous deadly action most often fit the profiles of borderline psychotics more than hardcore believers.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; He cites a 2010 study by terrorism analyst Brian Jenkins of the [[RAND Corporation]], which states that it would be more appropriate to describe &quot;lone wolves&quot; as &quot;stray dogs&quot; which, &quot;&quot;while still dangerous, skulk about, sniffing at violence, vocally aggressive but skittish without backup.&quot;&lt;ref name=DB&gt;{{cite web |last1=Siegel|first1=Jacob |title=Lone Wolves, Terrorist Runts, and the Stray Dogs of ISIS: Why ISIS and al Qaeda rely on loners and losers to carry out their terrorist agenda in the West |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/24/in-canada-the-stray-dogs-of-isis.html |accessdate=November 7, 2014 |publisher=Daily Beast |date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British====
Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] said he was &quot;appalled by [the] attack in Ottawa&quot; and offered his full support to his Canadian and Commonwealth counterpart, Stephen Harper, and the Canadian people as they dealt with the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;india&quot;/&gt;

An editorial in the ''The Guardian'' on October 26 said &quot;it is hard to judge the exact significance of this week’s events&quot; and &quot;[Canada's] diversity is reflected in an acute sensitivity to the risks of conflating the threat of terror with Islam itself, which represents the country’s second largest faith community.&quot;  The editorial ended with:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 And only a fortnight ago, its parliament voted to join the coalition in support of the US bombing of Isis targets: the country’s security agencies were clear that they believed the decision would heighten the risk of a terrorist attack.  Lawmakers were drafting legislation to combat radical violence before this latest attack. Politicians should now pause before succumbing to the temptation to rush through laws that further restrict civil liberties in the name of national security. It would be a betrayal of all that Canada represents if it allowed exceptional, and horrific, events to remould that society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/23/guardian-view-terror-attacks-ottawa-hold-tolerance-diversity|title=''The Guardian view on the terror attacks in Ottawa: hold fast to tolerance and diversity.

That would risk handing victory to the terrorists'', Editorial, ''The Guardian'', October 23, 2014|author =Editorial|work=the Guardian|accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also in ''The Guardian'', Emer O'Toole, a columnist and assistant professor at [[Concordia University]] commented that &quot;The uncertainty of the situation was belied, however, by....inflammatory rhetoric&quot; and further that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Harper’s minimal statement after Justin Bourque shot and killed three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in Moncton, New Brunswick, in June, made no mention of terror. Yet Bourque’s actions bore the hallmarks of a conservative and conspiratorial anti-state worldview reminiscent of Norwegian killer Anders Breivik. There was no appeal to Canadian solidarity in the face of an attack on &quot;our country, our values, on our society&quot;; there was no affirmation to &quot;remain vigilant against those at home and abroad who would harm us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/23/ottawa-shooting-canada-terrorism-draconian-response|title=''Canada won’t be cowed by terrorism, or by a draconian response to its threat.

An editorial in ''[[The Economist]]'' from November 8, 2014, in discussing the impact on US-Canada border security, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;The attack in Ottawa last month by a lone gunman, who killed a Canadian soldier and stormed parliament, seems likely to make matters worse. Although there is still uncertainty about the motives of the gunman, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau—possibly a deranged outcast, possibly a religious extremist—the United States is reviewing security along the 5,525-mile (8,890km) line which separates the two countries (including the Alaskan land border).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21631103-violence-ottawa-has-thickened-once-seamless-border-souring-mood-both|title=''Undefended no more: Violence in Ottawa has thickened a once-seamless border, souring the mood on both sides'', ''The Economist'', 8 November 2014|work=The Economist|accessdate=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
