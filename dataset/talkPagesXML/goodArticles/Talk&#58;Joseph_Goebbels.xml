== Missing an obvious point ==


This is a very good article but it's missing what I would have thought was a fairly obvious point: why is his last name spelled as &quot;Goebbels&quot; instead of as &quot;G√∂bbels&quot;. I realized it is universally spelled without the umlaut, but shouldn't there be some explanation why? How is his name spelled on his birth certificate? Shouldn't there be an explanation of this (presumably in a footnote) when his name is presented in the first sentence?  __[[Special:Contributions/209.179.86.123|209.179.86.123]] ([[User talk:209.179.86.123|talk]]) 17:38, 20 January 2016 (UTC)
:The sources we used to prepare the article don't cover this point. The German wiki also uses &quot;Goebbels&quot; without any comment on the spelling. ‚Äî [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;üçÅ&lt;/span&gt; ([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 20:39, 20 January 2016 (UTC)
::It is quite common for German ''names'' to be spelled in full without umlaut. [[Goethe]] and [[Emmy Noether]] spring to mind. There is no &quot;why&quot;, any more than for any other point of custom.

==Goebbels &quot;contributions&quot; in World War I==
He would later falsely claim that his leg deformity was a result of a war wound; the nearest personel contribution Goebbels would make toward World War I was as from June 1917 to October 1917 as a B√ºrosoldat (office soldier) beim Vaterl√§ndischen Hilfswerk {Self help unit} in Rheydt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?f=45&amp;t=70253&amp;p=635790&amp;hilit=Rheydt#p635790 Dr Jodef Goebbels 1917-1923]&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;‚Äî&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/50.5.87.37|50.5.87.37]] ([[User talk:50.5.87.37|talk]]) 15:47, 17 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Goebbels wrote that he was a communist in the mid 1920s ==

Goebbels wrote in his diary in 1924 &quot;&quot;Communism. Jewry. I am a German communist.&quot; The source is Peter Longerich's Goebbels, p. 26

Shouldn't this be included in the article?--[[User:John Bird|John Bird]] ([[User talk:John Bird|talk]]) 22:35, 27 October 2016 (UTC)

:I would be very interested in see the whole entry for that day, or at least the most pertinent part, to get some context here. My immediate reaction is that G is actually musing about a contrast, not an identification with Communism. &quot;I am a German Communist&quot; seems (to me) to be indicating that he is saying &quot;I am a national socialist&quot;. [[User:Irondome|Irondome]] ([[User talk:Irondome|talk]]) 23:04, 27 October 2016 (UTC)

Most of Longerich's biography of Goebbels is freely available to read via Google books (just type in &quot;German communist&quot;). Goebbels in the early to mid 1920s identified much more with socialism than any form of nationalism. He admired Lenin, read a lot of Russian novelists such as Dostoevsky, saw Russia as Germany's natural ally and openly called himself a German communist, see pages 26 and 534.

Goebbels wasn't talking about any contrast, in the 1920s he was much more influenced by socialist thinkers and read Marx and other left-wing thinkers and identified himself as such, it was this that actually drew him to Nazism. Remember the name of the party was 'National Socialist' and Goebbels personally identified much more with the latter part than the former.--[[User:John Bird|John Bird]] ([[User talk:John Bird|talk]]) 01:14, 28 October 2016 (UTC)
 
:Yeah I know his affiliations with the Strasser brothers. So he was a left wing nazi basically. [[User:Irondome|Irondome]] ([[User talk:Irondome|talk]]) 12:12, 28 October 2016 (UTC)
::Yes, he was, at the time, part of the left leaning &quot;socialist&quot; part of the Party. But, that did not last and he changed to Hitler's Munich based wing of the Party in 1926, after convincing himself that Hitler was &quot;the greatest thing since sliced bread&quot;, so to speak; Hitler won out in the end. [[User:Kierzek|Kierzek]] ([[User talk:Kierzek|talk]]) 12:18, 28 October 2016 (UTC)
:::Page 39-40 of Longerich: Longerich implies that Goebbels thought Communism is flawed because several of its top leaders in the USSR were Jews. Page 43, Goebbels studies the works of Karl Marx and Rosa Luxemburg, but finds his own antisemitism gets in the way of accepting. Page 48‚Äì49, Longerich says that Goebbels' notion of socialism was not about state control of the means of production, but rather about controlling and organizing the society and its citizens. Therefore it was not true socialism, but something else. Page 49, he goes on to say that Goebbels wished to be viewed as a radical left-leaning member of the NSDAP, and hence being a socialist was &quot;a fanciful pose he liked to strike.&quot; ‚Äî [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;üçÅ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 22:18, 28 October 2016 (UTC)

User:Diannaa

That's correct but his earlier adherence to left-wing politics should be included in the article, including his own words of describing himself as a 'German communist', it was the 'socialist' part of the Nazi party that made an impact on the young Goebbels, not the nationalist side of it. It was only ''after'' he joined the Nazi party that he started to adhere to nationalist beliefs.--[[User:John Bird|John Bird]] ([[User talk:John Bird|talk]]) 10:06, 29 October 2016 (UTC)
:Those aspects are discussed in the article; so, I am at a loss what you feel needs to be added. And he continued to be &quot;left leaning&quot; (and conflicted) until during 1926 when Hitler &quot;won him back over&quot; and the &quot;Northern sector&quot; lost out. [[User:Kierzek|Kierzek]] ([[User talk:Kierzek|talk]]) 15:19, 29 October 2016 (UTC)

== Inclusion of quotes from Goebbels' diaries about the extermination of the Jews ==

Here are two quotes from Goebbels' diaries:

February 14, 1942: 

{{quote|The F√ºhrer once again expressed his determination to clean up the Jews in Europe pitilessly. There must be no squeamish sentimentalism about it. The Jews have deserved the catastrophe that has now overtaken them. Their destruction will go hand in hand with the destruction of our enemies. We must hasten this process with cold ruthlessness.}}

March 27, 1942: 

{{quote|A judgment is being visited upon the Jews that, while barbaric, is fully deserved by them. The prophecy which the F√ºhrer made about them for having brought on a new world war is beginning to come true in a most terrible manner. One must not be sentimental in these matters. If we did not fight the Jews, they would destroy us. It's a life-and-death struggle between the Aryan race and the Jewish bacillus.}}

Does anyone feel that these need to be included in the article?--[[User:John Bird|John Bird]] ([[User talk:John Bird|talk]]) 19:08, 5 November 2016 (UTC)
:I don't; in fact I just removed them. It's self-serving stuff he told himself to justify what they were doing, and I don't think we should include it. ‚Äî [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;üçÅ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 21:50, 5 November 2016 (UTC)
::I don't believe they should be included either. They are verbiage which is not needed and self-serving. [[User:Kierzek|Kierzek]] ([[User talk:Kierzek|talk]]) 00:52, 7 November 2016 (UTC)

== Quote removal ==

Just wanted to add a longer explanation of why I removed the quote in {{diff|Joseph Goebbels|748964320|prev|this edit}}. It doesn't tell us anything that isn't already covered, and without a detailed off-topic explanation of who Kerrl is and why his opinion is important, it lacks context. For these reasons I think we should not include it. ‚Äî [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;üçÅ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 14:12, 11 November 2016 (UTC)
:I agree, it really does not add information which is not already covered. [[User:Kierzek|Kierzek]] ([[User talk:Kierzek|talk]]) 14:24, 11 November 2016 (UTC)</text>
