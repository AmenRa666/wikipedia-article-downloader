'''USS ''Lanikai''''', was a [[schooner]]-rigged diesel powered yacht commissioned into the [[United States Navy]] during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], before being transferred to the [[Royal Australian Navy]].

The ship was built as MY ''Hermes'' by W. F. Stone of [[Oakland, California]], in 1914, for the Williams-Diamond Company, agents for the trading company ''Jaluit-Gesellschaft'' of [[Hamburg]], Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavSource&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/130096.htm |title=Patrol Yacht HMAS Lanikai, ex-USS Lanikai, ex-USS Hermes |publisher=NavSource Naval History |accessdate=2009-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==

===World War I, 1917&amp;ndash;1919===
The German vessel was in port at [[Honolulu]] when the United States entered World War I in April 1917. Taken over by the Navy by Executive Order, she was commissioned at Honolulu as '''USS ''Hermes''''' on 1 April 1918, Lt. John T. Diggs in command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hermes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/h5/hermes.htm |title=Hermes |publisher=[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]] |accessdate=2009-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally intended as a submarine patrol vessel, ''Hermes'' performed this duty out of Honolulu during the summer of 1918. On 31 August she sailed on a cruise among the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands|islands northwest of Hawaii]], including [[Laysan]] and [[Wake Island|Wake]], to search for survivors of shipwrecks, signs of enemy activity, and to conduct a survey on wildlife and particularly birds for the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Biological Survey Commission]], Washington. After returning to Pearl Harbor on 2 October, she continued as a patrol craft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hermes&quot;/&gt;

===Inter-war activities, 1919&amp;ndash;1941===
''Hermes'' was ordered decommissioned on 16 January 1919 and placed at the disposal of the [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaiian territorial government]] for use as a tender to [[Leper colony|leper colonies]]. When the territorial government decided they could not afford her upkeep, ''Hermes'' was turned over to the Pacific Air Detachment, whom she served as a store ship and general auxiliary craft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hermes&quot;/&gt;

''Hermes'' was sold on 21 October 1926 to the Lanikai Fish Company and renamed ''Lanikai'', and sold again in 1929 to the Hawaiian Sea Products Company. Laid up in 1931, the yacht was sold in 1933 to [[Castle &amp; Cooke|Northrup Castle]] of Honolulu, and sold in 1936 to Harry W. Crosby of [[Seattle]], Washington. In 1937 she was sold to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studios for use in making the film ''[[The Hurricane (1937 film)|The Hurricane]]'', starring [[Jon Hall (actor)|Jon Hall]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]]. Following completion of the film she was used as the MGM yacht until sold on 6 April 1939 to E. M. Grimm of the Luzon Stevedoring Company of [[Manila]], Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavSource&quot;/&gt;

===World War II===

====Operations in the Philippines, 1941&amp;ndash;1942====
''Lanikai'' was taken into the United States Navy at [[Cavite Navy Yard]], Philippine Islands, under charter from Luzon Stevedoring Co., on 5 December 1941, and commissioned the same day with Lieutenant (and future admiral) [[Kemp Tolley]] in command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanikai&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/l3/lanikai.htm |title=Lanikai |publisher=[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]] |accessdate=2009-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in November 1941 it became apparent to the American Government that Japanese forces were tactically deposed for major operations in [[Southeast Asia]], but their precise target was unknown. A large convoy was steaming south from the [[Formosa Straits]], and it was hoped that learning the destination of these ships might reveal Japan's intentions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanikai&quot;/&gt;

On 2 December, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] ordered, through [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Admiral [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Harold R. Stark]], that the Commander in Chief, [[Asiatic Fleet]], Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]] &quot;charter three small vessels to form a defensive information patrol... to observe and report by radio Japanese movements in the west [[South China Sea|China Sea]] and [[Gulf of Siam]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanikai&quot;/&gt;

''Lanikai'' was one of the small ships chartered to learn of Japan's intentions. Fitted out at Cavite, with the greatest dispatch, the schooner lay at the entrance of [[Manila Bay]] in the early hours of 8 December (7 December east of the [[International Date Line]]) awaiting daylight to thread her way through the dangerous minefields which guarded the harbor. Tolley's orders read: &quot;Patrol off the entrance of [[Cam Ranh Bay]] and report the direction taken by the Japanese Fleet when it emerges.&quot; However, at 0300 word of Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] arrived with orders to return to Manila.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanikai&quot;/&gt;

In ensuing weeks, the schooner patrolled the approaches to Manila Bay and served as dispatch vessel within the harbor. On 10 December she survived the devastating Japanese air raid which destroyed Cavite Navy Yard. On Christmas Day, she assisted in the evacuation of Manila, carrying Army Officers and equipment to [[Corregidor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanikai&quot;/&gt;

====Escape to Australia, 1941&amp;ndash;1942====
As a result of plans and actions of Lt. Comdr. [[Charles L. Adair|Charles Adair]], Flag Lieutenant to Admiral Hart, approval was obtained for ''Lanikai'' to attempt to escape to the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. On the evening of 26 December, carrying as passengers one Dutch and three American officers, ''Lanikai'', with her Filipino crew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1973/6/1973_6_56.shtml |title=THE STRANGE MISSION OF THE Lanikai |author=[[Kemp Tolley]] |date=October 1973 |work=[[American Heritage Magazine]] |publisher=[[American Heritage Publishing]] |accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; got underway from [[Mariveles, Bataan|Mariveles harbor]], Luzon, &quot;destination unknown&quot;. Heading generally south, hiding in friendly coves during daylight, and traveling principally at night, the schooner sailed from island to island as Japanese forces spread across the East Indies with explosive speed. Storms covered her as she crossed the three large stretches of open water which lay between Luzon and Australia, and offered no coves for daylight concealment. When, as happened all too often, enemy aircraft approached the lightly armed schooner, they were preoccupied for the most part, with bigger game; but, at [[Surabaya]], Java, on 3 February 1942, three Japanese bombs straddled the schooner so close aboard that ''Lanikai'' crewmen put off in a skiff to pick up a large quantity of stunned fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanikai&quot;/&gt;

In late February, under full sail despite heavy seas, ''Lanikai'' headed due south from [[Tjilatjap]], Java. This course was taken to avoid enemy forces which might be searching the direct route from Java to [[Darwin, Australia]]. On 1 March, while about 200 miles east of [[Christmas Island]], a large Japanese task force was sighted on the port bow. Evasive action by ''Lanikai'' was successful. On 18 March, 82 days after departing Mariveles, the schooner arrived at [[Fremantle, Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanikai&quot;/&gt;

====Service in Australia, 1942&amp;ndash;1945====
After replenishment and repairs, she got underway, on 4 April, to cruise along the northwest Australian coast and search for possible Japanese coast watchers. Lt. Comdr. Adair relieved Lt Comdr. Tolley of command of the vessel on 27 April and continued the search into mid-May. ''Lanikai'' was decommissioned at Fremantle on 22 August, and was transferred to the [[Royal Australian Navy]] in which she served on harbor defense throughout the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanikai&quot;/&gt;

===Fate, 1945&amp;ndash;1947===
At the end of the war, ''Lanikai'' was sent back to the Philippines, and returned to her previous owner at Manila in 1946, but the owner refused to accept her in such poor condition. While undergoing repair at Subic Bay, the US Naval Base North of Manila, ''Lanikai'' sank during a typhoon in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavSource&quot;/&gt;  In 2003 the wreck of the vessel was found in Nabasan Bay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wreckage of 'Suicide' US warship found in Subic |author=Tonette Orejas |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6bhjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eyUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1976,6042521&amp;dq=lanikai+subic+bay+2003&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=14 November 2003 |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artifacts later salvaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Old ship stirs World War II mystery  |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/04/27/2003138341 |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |date=27 April 2004 |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificwrecks.com/ships/usn/lanikai.html |title=
