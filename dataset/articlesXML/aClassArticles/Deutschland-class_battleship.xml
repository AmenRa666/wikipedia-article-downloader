The '''''Deutschland'' class''' was a group of five [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the German [[Kaiserliche Marine]]. The class comprised {{SMS|Deutschland|1904|2}}, {{SMS|Hannover||2}}, {{SMS|Pommern||2}}, {{SMS|Schlesien||2}}, and {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}}. Built between 1903 and 1908, the ships closely resembled those of the preceding {{sclass-|Braunschweig|battleship|4}}, though they had stronger armor protection. They were made obsolete before they were even completed by the launch of the revolutionary [[Royal Navy]] battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906. As a result, they were the last ships of that type built for the German Navy. They were followed by the {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|1}}s, Germany's first [[dreadnought battleship]]s.

With the commissioning of the ''Deutschland'' class, the fleet had enough battleships to form two full battle squadrons; the fleet was then reorganized into the [[High Seas Fleet]], which saw combat during [[World War I]]. Despite their obsolescence, all five of these ships were present at the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May – 1 June 1916. In the confused night actions, ''Pommern'' was torpedoed and sunk. After the battle, the four surviving ships were removed from the front-line fleet and employed in secondary tasks. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] permitted Germany to retain several old battleships for coastal defense, including the four ''Deutschland''-class ships.

However, instead of being used as a coastal defense ship, ''Deutschland'' was broken up in 1920–1922. ''Hannover'' was to be converted into a target vessel, although this was never done. She was eventually broken up in 1944–1946. ''Schlesien'' and ''Schleswig-Holstein'' were the only two vessels of the class to see continued front-line service in the [[Reichsmarine]] and later the [[Kriegsmarine]]. Both ships saw limited duty during [[World War II]], which was inaugurated by the firing of ''Schleswig-Holstein''{{'}}s main guns at the Polish fortress at [[Westerplatte]]. Near the end of the war the two ships were both sunk.

== Design ==

The five ''Deutschland''-class battleships were the last pre-dreadnoughts built by the German Navy. They were similar to the preceding ''Braunschweig''-class ships—''Deutschland'' was nearly identical, though the design was modified slightly after the lead ship was laid down. The four subsequent ships had a somewhat different boiler arrangement and slightly thicker armor compared to the ''Braunschweig''-class ships.{{sfn|Staff|p=5}} All five vessels of the ''Deutschland'' class dispensed with the turret mountings for the secondary {{convert|17|cm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} guns; all of these guns were mounted in [[casemate]]s in the hull. The ships were built despite rumors of the capabilities of the revolutionary {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} then under construction.{{sfn|Hore|p=69}} Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] insisted on their construction, since larger ships would have necessitated widening the [[Kiel Canal|Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]]. This would have put a prohibitive strain on the naval budget for the year.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Gray|p=141}}

=== General characteristics ===
[[File:Deutschland class line-drawing.png|thumb|left|Line-drawing of the ''Deutschland'' class]]

The ''Deutschland''-class ships were {{convert|125.90|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|127.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[length overall|overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22.20|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.21|m|ftin|abbr=on}} forward. The ships were designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|13191|t|LT|sp=us|0}} with a standard load, and displaced up to {{convert|14218|t|LT|sp=us|0}} at full load.{{sfn|Gröner|p=21}} The ''Deutschland''-class ships' hulls were built with transverse and longitudinal steel frames. Steel hull plates were riveted to the structure created by the frames. The hull was split into twelve [[watertight compartment]]s, although ''Pommern'' had thirteen compartments. The hull included a [[double bottom]] that ran for 84&amp;nbsp;percent of the length of the ship.{{sfn|Gröner|p=20}}

The ships handled less easily than the preceding ''Braunschweig''-class ships, though they suffered less marked [[weather helm]]. Their [[metacentric height]] was {{convert|.98|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gröner|p=21}} The ships' crews numbered 35 officers and 708 enlisted men. When one of them was a squadron [[flagship]], the crew was augmented by 13 officers and 66 enlisted men; while serving as a second command ship, 2 officers and 23 enlisted men were added to her standard crew.{{sfn|Gröner|p=20}} After she became a training ship in 1935, ''Schlesien''{{'}}s crew consisted of 29 officers and 559 enlisted men, plus up to 214 cadets. ''Schleswig-Holstein'' differed somewhat; her crew as a training ship numbered 31 officers and 565 men and up to 175 [[sea cadets|cadets]]. ''Deutschland'' and her sisters carried a number of smaller vessels, including two picket boats, one admiral's barge, two [[Launch (boat)|launches]], one [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnace]], two [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], two [[yawl]]s, and two [[dinghy|dinghies]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=21}}

=== Machinery ===

''Deutschland'' and her sisters were equipped with three-shaft [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple expansion steam engines]]. The ships had a single rudder and three screw propellers. The two outer propellers were three-bladed, and {{convert|4.80|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter. The center screw had four blades and was {{convert|4.50|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=18–20}} Steam was supplied to the engines by twelve marine-type boilers, four for each engine, with the exception of ''Deutschland''.{{sfn|Gröner|p=20}} This ship was boilered as in ''Braunschweig'', with eight marine-type boilers and six cylindrical boilers.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=18–20}} ''Deutschland''{{'}}s engines were rated at {{convert|16000|PS|ihp kW|lk=on|abbr=on|0}}, while the other four ships' engines were rated at {{convert|17000|PS|ihp kW|lk=on|abbr=on|0}}. The design speed for all of the ships was {{convert|18|kn|link=on}}, though on trials all five ships exceeded the figure.{{sfn|Gröner|p=21}}

The ships were designed to carry {{convert|700|t|sp=us}} of coal, though additional spaces could be utilized as fuel storage, which increased fuel capacity to {{convert|1540|t|sp=us}}. This provided a maximum range of {{convert|4800|nmi|sp=us}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|p=21}} Electrical power was supplied from four turbo-generators that supplied {{convert|260|kW}} each at 110&amp;nbsp;[[volts]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=20}}

=== Armament ===

[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-38, &quot;SMS Deutschland&quot;, vorderer Geschützturm.jpg|thumb|''Deutschland''{{'}}s forward main battery turret|alt=Two long gun barrels jut out of a wide, round gun turret aboard a warship; the deck is covered in heavy chains, winches, and cranes]]

The armament of the ''Deutschland'' class was nearly identical to that of the preceding ''Braunschweig'' class, although it was rearranged slightly and increased in number. The primary armament consisted of four [[28 cm SK L/40 gun|{{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/40]]{{efn|name=gun nomenclature}} quick-firing guns in two twin [[Gun turret|turrets]], one forward and one to the rear of the main superstructure. The turrets were the Drh.L. C/01 model, which allowed elevation to 30° and depression to −5°. At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets out to {{convert|18830|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The guns fired {{convert|240|kg|lb|abbr=on}} shells in both high-explosive and [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] (AP) types. [[Muzzle velocity]] for both types of shells was 820&amp;nbsp;m/s (2,690&amp;nbsp;f/s). At a range of {{convert|12000|m|yd|abbr=on}}, the AP shells could penetrate armor plating up to {{convert|160|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.{{sfn|NavWeaps (28 cm/40)}}

The secondary battery consisted of fourteen {{convert|17|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns mounted in casemates amidships. Five were emplaced in the top deck and two one deck higher in the superstructure on either side. The casemates allowed elevation to 22° and depression to −5°. At 22°, the guns could engage targets {{convert|14500|m|yd|abbr=on}}. Each gun was supplied with 130 armor-piercing shells, and [[rate of fire|fired at a rate]] of approximately 5 per minute. The guns had an arc of train of 160°.{{sfn|NavWeaps (17 cm/40)}}

The ships were armed with twenty-two {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} quick-firing guns in single mounts, which were manually operated. The guns fired {{convert|15.4|lb|kg|abbr=on}} high-explosive shells at up to 12 rounds per minute.{{sfn|Gröner|p=20}}{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Gray|p=140}} They were supplied with 140 shells each. The guns could hit targets out to {{convert|11000|m|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|NavWeaps (8.8 cm/35)}}

=== Armor ===

The ''Deutschland''-class ships were equipped with [[Krupp cemented armor]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=20}} ''Deutschland'' had a slightly different arrangement in the [[belt armor]] and the citadel in the superstructure. ''Deutschland''{{'}}s belt was {{convert|225|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the waterline and tapered to {{convert|140|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the lower edge. Her sister ships' belts was increased in thickness to {{convert|240|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the waterline and down to {{convert|170|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the bottom edge. In ''Deutschland'', the citadel armor was {{convert|160|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, while on the other four ships the armor was 170&amp;nbsp;mm thick. All five ships had an armored deck that was {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.{{sfn|Staff|p=6}}

The main battery gun turrets had armored sides that were {{convert|280|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick and roofs that were {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The [[barbette]]s that held the turrets were armored with {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick steel. The casemate guns were protected by {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick armor plating. Their forward [[conning tower]]s were protected by {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the sides, while the rear conning towers had {{convert|140|mm|in|abbr=on}} worth of armor.{{sfn|Staff|p=6}}

== Construction ==

''Deutschland'' was ordered for the German fleet under the contract designation &quot;N.&quot;{{efn|name=provisional names}} She was laid down at the [[Germaniawerft]] dockyard in 1903, under construction number 109.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=20–21}} She was launched on 20 November 1904; once she left the stocks fitting out work commenced. This included the installation of the ship's armament, completion of the interior compartments, and the finishing of the superstructure. By mid 1906 work on the ship was finished. ''Deutschland'' was commissioned into the fleet on 3 August of that year.{{sfn|Gröner|p=22}} ''Hannover'' was ordered as &quot;O&quot; and laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven]] in 1904.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=20–21}} She was launched on 29 September 1905 and commissioned on 1 October 1907.{{sfn|Gröner|p=22}}

''Pommern'' was laid down at the [[AG Vulcan]] dockyard in Stettin under the provisional name &quot;P&quot; in 1904.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=20–21}} She was launched on 2 December 1905 and commissioned into the fleet on 1 October 1907.{{sfn|Gröner|p=22}} In 1904, ''Schlesien'' was laid down at the [[Schichau-Werke]] in Danzig under the provisional name &quot;R.&quot;{{sfn|Gröner|pp=20–21}} She was launched on 28 May 1906 and commissioned on 5 May 1908.{{sfn|Gröner|p=22}} ''Schleswig-Holstein'' was ordered from the Germaniawerft dockyard under the contract name &quot;Q.&quot; Her keel was laid there in 1905.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=20–21}} Launched on 17 December 1906, ''Schleswig-Holstein'' was completed by July 1908 and commissioned on the 6th, the last ship of the five to join the fleet.{{sfn|Gröner|p=22}}

== Service history ==

Following their commissioning beginning in 1906, the ships joined the II Battle Squadron of the ''Heimatflotte'' (Home Fleet), which also included the ''Braunschweig''-class ships.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Gray|p=141}} ''Deutschland'' replaced {{SMS|Kaiser Wilhelm II||2}} as the flagship of the fleet. Once the II Battle Squadron was complete, the fleet was reorganized as the [[High Seas Fleet|''Hochseeflotte'']] (High Seas Fleet).{{sfn|Herwig|p=45}} The five ships conducted several training cruises and fleet maneuvers every year until 1914; these included cruises into the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea and annual tours of Norway.{{sfn|Staff|p=8–15}} In 1913, ''Deutschland'' was replaced as fleet flagship by the new dreadnought {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}}.{{sfn|Staff|p=10}} The five ships were in Norway for the annual fleet visit in July 1914. The threat of war forced the cruise to be cut short, and all of the ships were back in German ports by the end of the month.{{sfn|Staff|p=11}}

=== World War I ===

The ships of the ''Deutschland'' class continued to serve in the II Battle Squadron during [[World War I]]. The ships conducted patrols in the mouth of the [[Elbe River]] in the first weeks of the war while the rest of the fleet was still being mobilized. They also took part in most of the major fleet actions in the first two years of the war. This primarily included acting as a support force for the battlecruisers that bombarded the English coast in the hopes of luring out a portion of the British fleet.{{sfn|Staff|pp=10–15}}

The five ships participated in the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May – 1 June 1916 under the command of Admiral von Mauve,{{sfn|Tarrant|p=286}} where they formed the Second Battle Squadron (the Squadron was completed by a sixth pre-Dreadnought, the [[SMS Hessen|''Hessen'']] of the {{sclass-|Braunschweig|battleship|4}}). Towards the end of the fleet battle on the evening of 31 May, the five ''Deutschland''-class ships came to the aid of the mauled battlecruisers of the [[I Scouting Group]]. The ''Deutschland''s intervened and prevented the British battlecruisers under Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]] from pursuing the German ships.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=195}} In the darkness, the Germans had difficulty making out their targets and failed to score any hits; the British, however, managed to hit three of the ''Deutschland''s. ''Pommern'' was forced briefly to haul out of line.{{sfn|London|p=71}} During the night actions, ''Pommern'' was torpedoed. The torpedo detonated an ammunition magazine and destroyed the ship, killing all hands on board.{{sfn|London|p=89}} The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven by mid-day of 1 June, where the undamaged dreadnoughts of the {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Helgoland|battleship|4}}es took up defensive positions.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=263}}

By the end of 1916, the four remaining ships were withdrawn from service with the fleet. They were placed into reserve on 15 August 1917. ''Deutschland'' and ''Schleswig-Holstein'' became barracks ships in Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, respectively. ''Hannover'' was used as a guard ship in the [[Danish straits|Danish belt]], and ''Schlesien'' became a training ship in Kiel.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Gray|p=141}} Guns removed from these ships starting in 1917 were used by the Imperial Army in World War I as [[28 cm SK L/40 &quot;Bruno&quot;|railway guns]].

=== Inter-war years ===

Following the German defeat in World War I, three of the ''Deutschland''-class battleships were allowed to be retained in the German Navy, which was reorganized as the [[Reichsmarine]]: ''Hannover'', ''Schleswig-Holstein'' and ''Schlesien'', along with several of the ''Braunschweig''-class battleships.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=5–6}} ''Deutschland'' was instead scrapped in 1922.{{sfn|Gröner|p=22}} The three remaining pre-dreadnought battleships were modernized in the 1920s,{{sfn|Williamson|p=6}} which included the replacement of the ships' 17&amp;nbsp;cm guns with {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} pieces.{{sfn|''Proceedings''|p=1014}}

''Hannover'' was the first of all the old battleships to come in service with the Reichsmarine in February 1921 as fleet flagship in the Baltic. Her first homeport was Swinemünde but she was transferred to Kiel in 1922. In 1923 the German Navy adopted a new command structure and {{SMS|Braunschweig||2}} became flagship of the Fleet. In October 1925, ''Hannover'' was moved to the North Sea station. She was decommissioned in March 1927 when ''Schlesien'' returned to active service. With newly built masts but still three funnels she entered service again replacing {{SMS|Elsass||2}} in February 1930 until September 1931.{{sfn|Hildebrand|p=47 f|loc=Vol. 3}}

In 1932, ''Schleswig-Holstein'' was re-boilered and converted into a cadet training ship.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Chesneau|p=222}} One of the most significant changes visually was the trunking of the two forward funnels into a single larger smoke stack.{{sfn|Miller|p=99}} ''Schlesien'' was made the flagship of the battleship squadron in January 1933.{{sfn|Mueller|p=89}} In May 1935, the Reichsmarine was again reorganized as the [[Kriegsmarine]]. By this time, only ''Schlesien'' and ''Schleswig-Holstein'' were still operating as warships; the four ''Braunschweig''-class ships had been disposed of or converted into auxiliary ships.{{sfn|Williamson|p=6}}

''Hannover'' was struck from the navy list in 1936 and destined for the scrapyard. There were ideas to rebuilt her as a target ship especially for aircraft, although this never occurred. ''Schlesien'' was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Chesneau|p=222}} The following year, ''Schlesien'' toured South America, including a stop in Argentina in December.{{sfn|Newton|p=184}} By 1939, both ships had been replaced in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.{{sfn|Williamson|p=7}}{{efn|name=Nazi era construction}}

=== World War II ===

In August 1939, ''Schleswig-Holstein'' conducted what was purported to be a ceremonial tour of the Baltic to commemorate the sinking of the light cruiser {{SMS|Magdeburg}} in August 1914. At the conclusion of the tour, the ship was towed into the port of [[Danzig]] opposite the Polish military depot at [[Westerplatte]]. At 04:47 on 1 September, ''Schleswig-Holstein'' fired the first shots of [[World War II]], when she [[Battle of Westerplatte|opened fire on the base in Westerplatte]].{{sfn|Williamson|pp=7–8}} A detachment of marines then stormed the fortress, which resisted for seven days. Throughout the battle, ''Schleswig-Holstein'' provided artillery support. During the operation ''Schlesien'' remained in her training ship role, though she briefly acted as an [[icebreaker]] for [[U-boat]]s.{{sfn|Williamson|p=8}}

''Schleswig-Holstein'' and ''Schlesien'' then participated in the [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|occupation of Denmark]] and [[invasion of Norway]], respectively, in April 1940. Afterward, ''Schleswig-Holstein'' was again removed from front-line service and used as a training ship, while ''Schlesien'' resumed her ice-breaking duties. In March 1941, ''Schlesien'' escorted mine-layers in the Baltic. After returning from this operation, she became a barracks ship in [[Gotenhafen]].{{sfn|Williamson|p=8}}

In mid-1944, ''Schlesien''{{'}}s and ''Schleswig-Holstein''{{'}}s anti-aircraft armament was considerably strengthened to allow them to be used as an air defense ships in the port of [[Gotenhafen]]. ''Schleswig-Holstein'' was attacked by [[RAF]] bombers in December 1944, and although she was sunk in shallow water, her weapons could still be used. After a fire permanently disabled the ship, her crew was sent ashore to assist in the defense of [[Malbork|Marienburg]].{{sfn|Williamson|p=8}} Starting in 1944, ''Hannover'' was broken up for scrap; work lasted until 1945.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Chesneau|p=222}} Schlesien provided fire support for German troops in the vicinity of Gotenhafen between 15 and 21 March 1945.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=398}} In April, ''Schlesien'' was moved to [[Swinemünde]] to restock her ammunition supply as well as evacuate 1,000 wounded soldiers from the front. On 3 May she struck a mine outside Swinemünde; the following day she was scuttled by her crew in shallow water. Both ships were broken up in situ after the war.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Gray|pp=141–142}}

| The five nearest vessels are the ''Deutschland''-class ships.
}}

{{efn
| name = Deutschland powerplant
| These figures are for the four later ships; ''Deutschland'' had a slightly different powerplant that produced {{convert|16000|PS|ihp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}}, though her speed remained the same.
}}

{{efn
| name = Deutschland armor
| Figure for the four later ships; ''Deutschland''{{'}}s belt armor was only up to {{convert|225|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.
}}

{{efn
| name = gun nomenclature
| In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, &quot;SK&quot; (Schnelladekanone) denotes that the gun is quick loading, while the L/40 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/40 gun is 40 [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]], meaning that the gun is 40 times long as it is in diameter.
}}

{{efn
| name = provisional names
| German warships were ordered under provisional names; new additions to the fleet were given letter designations, while those that were intended to replace older vessels were given &quot;[[Ersatz]] (name of the ship to be replaced)&quot;.
}}

{{efn
| name = Nazi era construction
| The German navy began a construction program under the Nazi regime which included the {{sclass-|Deutschland|cruiser}}s and the {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship}}s and culminated in the {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s. These ships were all built to replace the old pre-dreadnoughts in German service. See: {{harvnb|Williamson|p=6}} and {{harvnb|Gröner|pp=31, 33, and 60}}.
