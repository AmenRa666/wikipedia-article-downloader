The '''Catalina affair''' ({{lang-sv|Catalinaaffären}}) was a military confrontation and [[Cold War]]-era diplomatic crisis in June 1952, in which [[Soviet Air Force]] fighter jets shot down two [[Sweden|Swedish]] aircraft over international waters in the [[Baltic Sea]]. The first aircraft to be shot down was an unarmed [[Swedish Air Force]] [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Tp 79]], a derivative of the [[Douglas DC-3]], carrying out radio and radar signals intelligence-gathering for the [[National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden)|National Defence Radio Establishment]]. None of the crew of eight was rescued.  

The second aircraft to be shot down was a Swedish Air Force Tp 47, a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Catalina]] flying boat, involved in the search and rescue operation for the missing DC-3. The Catalina's crew of five were saved.  The [[Soviet Union]] publicly denied involvement until [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] in 1991. Both aircraft were located in 2003, and the DC-3 was salvaged.

== Aircraft and crew ==

=== DC-3 ===
The first aircraft involved was a Swedish Air Force Douglas DC-3A-360 Skytrain,&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnusson 2007, p. 9&quot;/&gt; a military transport derivative of the [[DC-3]] known in Swedish service as Tp 79. It carried the serial number 79001. In the media coverage following the event, it became known simply as &quot;the DC-3.&quot;

The aircraft was manufactured in 1943 with original US serial number 42-5694, and was delivered to [[USAAF]] [[15th Airlift Squadron|15th Troop Carrier Squadron]] ([[61st Air Base Group|61st Troop Carrier Group]]). It saw action in northern Africa before being stationed at [[RAF Barkston Heath]]. It was flown on February 5, 1946, from [[Orly Air Base]] via [[Hanau Army Airfield]] to Bromma and was registered as SE-APZ on May 18, 1946 as a civil aircraft to Skandinaviska Aero AB.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson 2007, p. 9 and 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RZJets&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= RZJets database entry|publisher=Rzjets |url=http://www.rzjets.net/aircraft/?reg=224538 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 1952, it disappeared east of the isle of [[Gotska Sandön]] while carrying out [[signals intelligence]]-gathering operations for the Swedish National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA).&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnusson 2007, p. 11&quot;&gt;Magnusson 2007, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was lost with its entire crew of eight in the incident. Three of the eight crew members were military personnel from the Swedish Air Force, and the other five were civilian signals intelligence (SIGINT) operators from the National Defence Radio Establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson 2007, pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catalina ===
[[File:Catalina TP 47 Mattias B.JPG|thumb|Tp 47 Canso (Catalina) at the Swedish Air Force Museum.]]
Three days after the initial incident, on June 16, 1952, two Consolidated PBY-5 Catalina [[flying boats]], known in Swedish service as Tp 47, searched for the DC-3 north of [[Estonia]]. One of the aircraft, carrying airframe serial no. 47002,&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnusson 2007, p. 11&quot;/&gt; was shot down by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aircraft, but the crew of five ditched near the West German freighter ''Münsterland'' and were rescued.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Catalina Affair |publisher=[[BBC]] |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A790049 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SwedishAirForceMuseum1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=A Troubled Time |publisher=Swedish Air Force Museum |url=http://www.flygvapenmuseum.se/en/Exhibitions/Acts-of-Secrecy/ |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ASN19520616-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19520616-1 |title= Accident description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The Soviet Union denied shooting down the DC-3, but a few days later a life raft with Soviet shell [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] was found. In 1956, while meeting the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Swedish Prime Minister]] [[Tage Erlander]], the Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] admitted that the Soviet Union had shot down the DC-3. This information was not released to the public at the time.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}

Sweden maintained for nearly 40 years that the plane was undertaking a navigation training flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grisell 2007, p. 3&quot;&gt;Grisell 2007, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Only after pressure from crewmembers' families&lt;ref name=&quot;Almeberg2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 1991 General Fyodor Shinkarenko ([[:ru:Шинкаренко, Фёдор Иванович|ru]]), a colonel in the early 1950s, admitted he had ordered the DC-3 shot down in 1952 by scrambling a [[MiG-15]]bis to intercept it.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwedishAirForceMuseum1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnusson 2007, p. 12&quot;&gt;Magnusson 2007, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==
[[File:DC-3 wreck at the Swedish Air Force Museum (starboard propeller and front).jpg|thumb|DC-3 wreckage exhibited at the Swedish Air Force Museum.]]

On June 10, 2003, airline captain Anders Jallai and historian Carl Douglas with the Swedish company Marin Mätteknik AB found the remains of the downed DC-3 by using [[sonar]] at {{Convert|126|m|abbr=on}} depth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnusson 2007, p. 9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovgren2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FRA 2003, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DN2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web

After 52 years, the remains of the DC-3 were lifted to the surface on March 19, 2004 by freezing the wreck with some {{convert|200|m3|abbr=on}} of sediments.&lt;ref name=&quot;FriGeo&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion ==
Bullet holes on 79001 showed that the DC-3 was shot down by a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15bis]] fighter. The exact splashdown time was also determined, as one of the clocks in the cockpit had stopped at 11:28:40 [[Central European Time|CET]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson 2007, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; To this date the remains of four of the eight-man crew have been found and positively identified.&lt;ref&gt;Holmlund 2008, pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt;
