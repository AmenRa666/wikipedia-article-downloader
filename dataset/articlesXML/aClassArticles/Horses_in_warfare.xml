[[File:Scotland Forever crop.jpg|thumb|''[[Scotland Forever!]]'' depicting the charge of the [[Royal Scots Greys]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]].]]

The first use of '''horses in warfare''' occurred over 5,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of horses [[equestrianism|ridden]] in warfare dates from [[Eurasia]] between 4000 and 3000&amp;nbsp;BC. A [[Sumer]]ian illustration of warfare from 2500&amp;nbsp;BC depicts some type of [[equidae|equine]] pulling wagons. By 1600&amp;nbsp;BC, improved [[horse harness|harness]] and [[chariot]] designs made chariot warfare common throughout the [[Ancient Near East]], and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350&amp;nbsp;BC. As formal [[cavalry]] tactics replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360&amp;nbsp;BC, the Greek cavalry officer [[Xenophon]] had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in [[technology]], including the invention of the [[saddle]], the [[stirrup]], and later, the [[horse collar]].

Many different types and sizes of horse were used in war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven, and whether they were being used for [[reconnaissance]], cavalry charges, [[Raid (military)|raiding]], communication, or supply. Throughout history, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s as well as horses played a crucial role in providing support to armies in the field.

Horses were well suited to the warfare tactics of the [[nomad]]ic cultures from the [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]]. Several [[East Asia]]n cultures made extensive use of cavalry and chariots. [[Muslim]] warriors relied upon [[light cavalry]] in their campaigns throughout [[North Africa]], [[Asia]], and Europe beginning in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. Europeans used several types of war horses in the [[Middle Ages]], and the best-known [[heavy cavalry]] warrior of the period was the armoured [[knight]]. With the decline of the knight and rise of gunpowder in warfare, light cavalry again rose to prominence, used in both European warfare and in the conquest of the [[Americas]]. Battle cavalry developed to take on a multitude of roles in the late 18th century and early 19th century and was often crucial for victory in the [[Napoleonic wars]]. In the Americas, the use of horses and development of mounted warfare tactics were learned by several tribes of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] and in turn, highly mobile horse regiments were critical in the [[American Civil War]].

Horse cavalry began to be phased out after [[World War I]] in favour of [[armoured warfare|tank warfare]], though a few horse cavalry units were still used into [[World War II]], especially as scouts. By the end of World War II, horses were seldom seen in battle, but were still used extensively for the transport of troops and supplies. Today, formal battle ready horse cavalry units have almost disappeared, though the [[United States Army Special Forces]] used horses in battle during the [[2001 invasion of Afghanistan]].  Horses are still seen in use by organized armed fighters in [[Third World]] countries. Many nations still maintain small units of mounted riders for patrol and [[reconnaissance]], and military horse units are also used for ceremonial and educational purposes. Horses are also used for [[historical reenactment]] of battles, [[Mounted police|law enforcement]], and in [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] competitions derived from the riding and training skills once used by the military.

==Types of horse used in warfare==
A fundamental principle of [[equine conformation]] is &quot;form to function&quot;. Therefore, the type of horse used for various forms of warfare depended on the work performed, the weight a horse needed to carry or pull, and distance travelled.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Conquerors'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Weight affects speed and endurance, creating a trade-off: armour added protection,&lt;ref&gt;Krebs ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; but added weight reduces maximum speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1198889,00.html|title=Bred for Speed&amp;nbsp;... Built for Trouble|journal=TIME|accessdate=2008-11-07|date=2006-05-28|author=Park, Alice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, various cultures had different military needs. In some situations, one primary type of horse was favoured over all others.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, G., ''The Arabian'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, multiple types were needed; warriors would travel to battle riding a lighter horse of greater speed and endurance, and then switch to a heavier horse, with greater weight-carrying capacity, when wearing heavy armour in actual combat.&lt;ref name=NicolleCK14&gt;Nicolle, ''Crusader Knight'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The average horse can carry up to approximately 30% of its body weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aerc.org/AERC_Rider_Handbook110303.asp|title=Chapter 3, Section IV: Size|author=American Endurance Ride Conference|accessdate=2008-08-07|date=November 2003|work=Endurance Rider's Handbook|publisher=AERC}}&lt;/ref&gt; While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, ''A Treatise on Roads and Pavements'', pp. 22&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cotner1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horsepullresults.com/LacledeCountyFairgroundsarticle.asp|title=Mighty horses pull more than their weight at fair|author=Luthy, Dusty|accessdate=2008-08-08|work=The Lebanon Daily Record|publisher=Horsepull Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses [[horse harness|harnessed]] to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight,&lt;ref name=dynamometer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easterndrafthorse.com/History/historydyn.htm|title= History of the draft horse dynamometer machine|author=Eastern Draft Horse Association|work=History|publisher=Eastern Draft horse Association|accessdate=2008-07-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080609233345/http://www.easterndrafthorse.com/History/historydyn.htm |archivedate = June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easterndrafthorse.com/Rules/EDHARules.htm |title=Eastern Draft Horse Association Rules|author=Eastern Draft Horse Association|work=History|publisher=Eastern Draft horse Association|accessdate=2008-07-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080609233413/http://www.easterndrafthorse.com/Rules/EDHARules.htm |archivedate = June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horsepull.com/Record%20Loads.htm |title=Records |author=Horsepull.com |work=|publisher=Horsepull.com |accessdate=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, horses that were [[driving (horse)|driven]] varied in size and had to make a trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', pp. 9&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy supply wagons, [[artillery]], and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses.&lt;ref name=Chamberlin146&gt;Chamberlin, ''Horse'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a [[horse collar]] than they could with a [[Breastplate (tack)|breast collar]], and even less with an ox [[yoke]].&lt;ref name=Chamberlin106&gt;Chamberlin, ''Horse'', pp. 106&amp;ndash;110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light-weight===
[[File:Edouard Detaille - Vive L'Empereur - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Hussar]]s were a [[Light cavalry|light type of cavalry]] between the 15th and 19th century. Here, [[4th Hussar Regiment (France)|French hussars]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].]]
Light, [[oriental horse]]s such as the ancestors of the modern [[Arabian horse|Arabian]], [[Barb (horse)|Barb]], and [[Akhal-Teke]] were used for warfare that required speed, endurance and agility.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, G., ''The Arabian'', pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; Such horses ranged from about {{hands|12}}  to just under {{hands|15}}, weighing approximately {{convert|800|to|1000|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Conquerors'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; To move quickly, riders had to use lightweight [[horse tack|tack]] and carry relatively light weapons such as bows, light spears, javelins, or, later, rifles. This was the original horse used for early chariot warfare, raiding, and light [[cavalry]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, G., ''The Arabian'', pp. 9, 13&amp;ndash;14, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively light horses were used by many cultures, including the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, G., ''The Arabian'', pp. 13&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mongols]], the [[Arab]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, G., ''The Arabian'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Throughout the [[Ancient Near East]], small, light animals were used to pull chariots designed to carry no more than two passengers, a driver and a warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, G., ''The Arabian'', pp. 2, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett29&quot;&gt;Bennett ''Conquerors'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In the European [[Middle Ages]], a lightweight war horse became known as the [[rouncey]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, ''A Knight and His Horse'', pp. 11&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medium-weight===
[[File:Mooko-HakataWall.jpg|thumb|Arriving Japanese [[samurai]] prepares to man the fortification against invaders of the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]], painted c.&amp;nbsp;1293 AD. By this time, a medium-weight horse was used.]]

Medium-weight horses developed as early as the [[Iron Age]] with the needs of various civilizations to pull heavier loads, such as chariots capable of holding more than two people,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett29&quot;/&gt; and, as [[light cavalry]] evolved into [[heavy cavalry]], to carry heavily armoured riders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards11ff&quot;&gt;Edwards, G., ''The Arabian'', pp. 11, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scythians]] were among the earliest cultures to produce taller, heavier horses.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, ''Cavalcade'', pp. 36&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt; Larger horses were also needed to pull supply wagons and, later on, artillery pieces. In Europe, horses were also used to a limited extent to maneuver [[cannons]] on the battlefield as part of dedicated [[horse artillery]] units. Medium-weight horses had the greatest range in size, from about {{hands|14.2}} but stocky,&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards11ff&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyland85&quot;/&gt; to as much as {{hands|16}},&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, ''English Medieval Knight 1300–1400'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; weighing approximately {{convert|1000|to|1200|lb|kg}}. They generally were quite agile in combat,&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Conquerors'', pp. 54, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; though they did not have the raw speed or endurance of a lighter horse. By the [[Middle Ages]], larger horses in this class were sometimes called [[destrier]]s. They may have resembled modern [[Baroque horse|Baroque]] or [[heavy warmblood]] breeds.{{#tag:ref|The [[Royal Armouries]] used a 15.2 hand [[Lithuanian Heavy Draught]] mare as a model for statues displaying various 15th and 16th century horse armour, as her body shape was an excellent fit.&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, ''The Warhorse 1250–1600'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} Later, horses similar to the modern [[warmblood]] often carried European cavalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;/&gt;

===Heavy-weight===
Large, heavy horses, weighing from {{convert|1500|to|2000|lb|kg}}, the ancestors of today's [[draft horse|draught horse]]s, were used, particularly in Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled heavy loads like supply wagons and were disposed to remain calm in battle. Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest-armoured [[knight]]s of the European Late [[Middle Ages]], though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle horse, was a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included draught animals or not.&lt;ref&gt;See Clark, &quot;Introduction&quot;, ''Medieval Horse'', pp. 22&amp;ndash;27 and Prestwich, ''Armies and Warfare in the Middle Ages'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included the ancestors of the [[Percheron]], agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Gies, ''Daily Life in Medieval Times'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ponies===
The British Army's 2nd Dragoons in 1813 had 340 ponies of {{hands|14.2}} and 55 ponies of {{hands|14}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first= M|title=Wellington's Victories.

===Other equids===
Horses were not the only [[equidae|equids]] used to support human warfare. [[Donkeys]] have been used as pack animals from antiquity&lt;ref&gt;Hamblin, ''Warfare'', p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-05-213.pdf | title=Special Forces Use of Pack Animals | work= Field Manual FM 3-05.213 |publisher= Army Special Forces |date=June 2004|accessdate=2008-11-02|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mule]]s were also commonly used, especially as pack animals and to pull wagons, but also occasionally for riding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubbell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hubbell, Gary |date=Dec 2006|number= |title= 21st century Horse Soldiers |journal= Western Horseman |volume=| doi = |page=45&amp;ndash;50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because mules are often both calmer and hardier than horses,&lt;ref name=Genetics190&gt;Equine Research ''Equine Genetics'' p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; they were particularly useful for strenuous support tasks, such as hauling supplies over difficult terrain. However, under gunfire, they were less cooperative than horses, so were generally not used to haul [[artillery]] on battlefields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cotner1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/americas-civil-war-horses-and-field-artillery.htm|author=Cotner, James R.|title=America's Civil War: Horses and Field Artillery |work=America's Civil War |publisher=Historynet.com |date=March 1996 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of a mule and work to which it was put depended largely on the breeding of the [[mare]] that produced the mule. Mules could be lightweight, medium weight, or even, when produced from draught horse [[mare]]s, of moderate heavy weight.&lt;ref name=Ensminger85&gt;Ensminger, ''Horses and Horsemanship'', pp. 85&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and deployment==
:''See also [[Horse training]]''
[[File:Kastor Niobid krater Louvre G341.jpg|thumb|[[Kastor]] wearing a [[pilos]]-like helmet, detail from a scene representing the gathering of the [[Argonauts]], from an Attic [[red-figure]] calyx-[[krater]], ca. 460–450 BC,  [[Orvieto]] ([[Volsinii]]), Italy.]]
The oldest known manual on training horses for chariot warfare was written c.&amp;nbsp;1350 BC by the [[Hittites|Hittite]] horsemaster, [[Kikkuli]].&lt;ref name=Chamberlin48&gt;Chamberlin ''Horse'' pp. 48&amp;ndash;49&lt;/ref&gt; An ancient manual on the subject of training riding horses, particularly for the [[Ancient Greek]] [[cavalry]] is ''Hippike'' (''[[On Horsemanship (Xenophon)|On Horsemanship]]'') written about 360 BC by the Greek cavalry officer [[Xenophon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hope&quot;&gt;Hope, ''The Horseman's Manual'', ch. 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest texts from Asia was that of [[Chanakya|Kautilya]], written about 323 BC.&lt;ref name=Chamberlin48/&gt;

Whether horses were trained to pull chariots, to be ridden as light or heavy cavalry, or to carry the armoured knight, much training was required to overcome the horse's natural instinct to flee from noise, the smell of blood, and the confusion of combat. They also learned to accept any sudden or unusual movements of humans while using a weapon or avoiding one.&lt;ref name=Hyland115&gt;Hyland, ''The Medieval Warhorse'', pp. 115&amp;ndash;117.&lt;/ref&gt; Horses used in close combat may have been taught, or at least permitted, to kick, strike, and even bite, thus becoming weapons themselves for the warriors they carried.&lt;ref name=Gravett29&gt;Gravett, ''Tudor Knight'', pp. 29&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cultures, a war horse used as a riding animal was trained to be controlled with limited use of [[rein]]s, responding primarily to the rider's [[riding aids|legs and weight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Au&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.efanational.com/?Page=369&amp;MenuID=Sports%2F11757%2F0%2F%2CDressage%2F11732%2F0%2F0|title= Dressage Explained |accessdate=2008-07-16|author= Equestrian Federation of Australia|work= EFA Website|publisher=Equestrian Federation of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horse became accustomed to any necessary [[horse tack|tack]] and protective armour placed upon it, and learned to balance under a rider who would also be laden with weapons and armour.&lt;ref name=Hyland115/&gt; Developing the balance and agility of the horse was crucial. The origins of the discipline of [[dressage]] came from the need to train horses to be both obedient and manoeuvrable.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usdf.org/about/about-dressage/history.asp|title= History of Dressage|accessdate=2008-07-16 |author= United States Dressage Federation |work= USDF Website|publisher= United States Dressage Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Haute ecole'' or &quot;High School&quot; movements of [[classical dressage]] taught today at the [[Spanish Riding School]] have their roots in manoeuvres designed for the battlefield. However, the ''[[airs above the ground]]'' were unlikely to have been used in actual combat, as most would have exposed the unprotected underbelly of the horse to the weapons of foot soldiers.&lt;ref name=Chamberlin197&gt;Chamberlin, ''Horse'', pp. 197&amp;ndash;198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses used for [[chariot tactics|chariot warfare]] were not only trained for combat conditions, but because many chariots were pulled by a team of two to four horses, they also had to learn to work together with other animals in close quarters under chaotic conditions.&lt;ref name=Roman214&gt;Hyland, ''Equus'', pp. 214&amp;ndash;218.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological innovations==
Horses were probably ridden in prehistory before they were driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Amschler, Wolfgang |date=June 1935|title= The Oldest Pedigree Chart |journal= The Journal of Heredity |volume=  26| issue = 6| doi = |page=233&amp;ndash;238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trench&quot;&gt;Trench, ''A History of Horsemanship'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest tools used to control horses were [[bridle]]s of various sorts, which were invented nearly as soon as the horse was [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]].&lt;ref&gt;Budiansky, ''The Nature of Horses'', pp. 50&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of [[bit (horse)|bit]] wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the [[Botai culture]] in northern [[Kazakhstan]], dated 3500&amp;ndash;3000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartwick&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.hartwick.edu/anthonyd/harnessing%20horsepower.html|title=The Earliest Horseback Riding and its Relation to Chariotry and Warfare|author1=Anthony, David W.  |author2=Dorcas R. Brown|work= Harnessing Horsepower|publisher=Institute for Ancient Equestrian Studies|accessdate=2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harness and vehicles===
[[File:Ägyptischer Maler um 1355 v. Chr. 001.jpg|thumb|[[Chariot]]s and [[archery|archers]] were weapons of war in [[Ancient Egypt]].]]
The invention of the wheel was a major technological innovation that gave rise to [[chariot]] warfare. At first, equines, both horses and [[asinus|onagers]], were hitched to wheeled carts by means of a [[yoke]] around their necks in a manner similar to that of [[oxen]].&lt;ref name=Pritchard&gt;Pritchard, ''The Ancient Near East'', illustration 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a design is incompatible with [[equine anatomy]], limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal. By the time of the [[Hyksos]] invasions of [[Egypt]], c.&amp;nbsp;1600 BC, horses were pulling chariots with an improved [[horse harness|harness]] design that made use of a [[breastplate (tack)|breastcollar]] and [[Breeching (tack)|breeching]], which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight.&lt;ref name=Chamberlin102&gt;Chamberlin, ''Horse'', pp. 102&amp;ndash;108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the chariot had become obsolete as a tool of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the [[horse collar]] in China during the 5th century AD ([[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 322&quot;&gt;Needham, ''Science and Civilization in China'', p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century,&lt;ref name=Chamberlin109&gt;Chamberlin, ''Horse'', pp. 109&amp;ndash;110.&lt;/ref&gt; and became widespread by the 12th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham317&quot;&gt;Needham, ''Science and Civilization in China'', p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major innovations that revolutionised the effectiveness of mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup.&lt;ref name=Techniques70&gt;Bennett and others, ''Fighting Techniques'', pp. 70, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs to protect themselves from the horse's spine and [[withers]], and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's [[English saddle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett43&quot;&gt;Bennett, ''Conquerors'' p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Scythians]] and [[Assyria]]ns used pads with added felt attached with a [[surcingle]] or [[horse tack|girth]] around the horse's [[horse anatomy|barrel]] for increased security and comfort.&lt;ref name=Ellis14/&gt; Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hope&quot;/&gt;

The saddle with a solid framework, or &quot;[[Saddle#Parts of an equestrian saddle|tree]]&quot;, provided a bearing surface to protect the horse from the weight of the rider, but was not widespread until the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hope&quot;/&gt; However, it made a critical difference, as horses could carry more weight when distributed across a solid saddle tree. A solid tree, the predecessor of today's [[Western saddle]], also allowed a more built-up seat to give the rider greater security in the saddle. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] are credited with the invention of the solid-treed saddle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science Show&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s70986.htm|title= The Horse in History|accessdate=2008-07-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006030339/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s70986.htm |archivedate=2008-10-06|author= Newby, Jonica, Jared Diamond and David Anthony|work= The Science Show|date=1999-11-13|publisher= Radio National}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An invention that made cavalry particularly effective was the stirrup. A toe loop that held the big toe was used in India possibly as early as 500 BC,&lt;ref name=Chamberlin110&gt;Chamberlin, ''Horse'', pp. 110&amp;ndash;114.&lt;/ref&gt; and later a single stirrup was used as a mounting aid. The first set of paired stirrups appeared in China about 322 AD during the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_madeinchina/2005-07/21/content_70825.htm|title=The invention and influences of stirrup|author=China Daily|work=The Development of Chinese Military Affairs|publisher=Chinese Ministry of Culture|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellis51&gt;Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp. 51&amp;ndash;53.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the invention of paired stirrups, which allowed a rider greater leverage with weapons, as well as both increased stability and mobility while mounted, nomadic groups such as the [[Mongol military tactics and organization|Mongols]] adopted this technology and developed a decisive military advantage.&lt;ref name=Chamberlin110/&gt;  By the 7th century, due primarily to invaders from Central Asia, stirrup technology spread from Asia to Europe.&lt;ref name=Dictionary300&gt;Bennett, ''Dictionary of Ancient &amp; Medieval Warfare'', p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pannonian Avar|Avar]] invaders are viewed as primarily responsible for spreading the use of the stirrup into central Europe.&lt;ref name=Curta319&gt;Curta, '&quot;The Other Europe,'' p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fields&gt;{{cite book |author=Fields, Nic |title=The Hun: : Scourge of God AD 375-565 |publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd. |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-84603-025-3  |page=50|others=Illustrations by Christa Hook; Page layout by Mark Holt; Index by Glyn Sutcliffe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eHLNqa-pc0C&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while stirrups were known in Europe in the 8th century, pictorial and literary references to their use date only from the 9th century.&lt;ref name=Warfare88/&gt; Widespread use in Northern Europe, including England, is credited to the [[Viking]]s, who spread the stirrup in the 9th and 10th centuries to those areas.&lt;ref name=Warfare88&gt;Nicolle, ''Medieval Warfare Sourcebook: Warfare in Western Christendom'', pp. 88&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seaby&gt;{{cite journal |title=Viking Stirrups from England and their Background |publisher=Medieval Archeology, Volume 24 |year=1980 |pages=87–122, see in particular map on page 91 &quot;The evolution of stirrup forms in Europe&quot; |author1=Seaby, Wilfred A.  |author2=Woodfield, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Christiansen&gt;{{cite book |author=Christiansen, Eric |title=The Norsemen in the Viking age |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=0-631-21677-4 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Standard of Ur - War.jpg|thumb|The &quot;War Panel&quot; of the [[Standard of Ur]]]]

The first [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence of horses used in warfare dates from between 4000 and 3000 BC in the [[steppe]]s of [[Eurasia]], in what today is [[Ukraine]], [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]]. Not long after [[domestication of the horse]], people in these locations began to live together in large fortified towns for protection from the threat of horseback-riding raiders,&lt;ref name=&quot;Science Show&quot;/&gt; who could attack and escape faster than people of more sedentary cultures could follow.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Conquerors'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORYKEEGAN188&quot;&gt;Keegan, ''A History of Warfare'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Horse-mounted nomads of the [[steppe]] and current day [[Eastern Europe]] spread [[Indo-European Languages]] as they conquered other tribes and groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, Azar. &quot;War in Human Civilization&quot;. Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of horses in organised warfare was also documented early in recorded history. One of the first depictions of equids is the &quot;war panel&quot; of the [[Standard of Ur]], in [[Sumer]], dated c.&amp;nbsp;2500 BC, showing horses (or possibly onagers or mules) pulling a four-wheeled wagon.&lt;ref name=Pritchard/&gt;

===Chariot warfare===
{{See also|Chariot|Chariot tactics}}

Among the earliest evidence of chariot use are the burials of horse and chariot remains by the [[Andronovo culture|Andronovo]] (Sintashta-Petrovka) culture in modern Russia and [[Kazakhstan]], dated to approximately 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Crouwel, J.H.  |author2=M.A. Littauer|date=Dec 1996|number= |title= The Origin of the True Chariot|journal= Antiquity|volume=  70| issue = 270| doi = |pages=934&amp;ndash;939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest documentary evidence of what was probably chariot warfare in the [[Ancient Near East]] is the Old Hittite [[Anitta]] text, of the 18th century BC, which mentioned 40 teams of horses at the siege of [[Salatiwara]].&lt;ref&gt;Drower, &quot;Syria&quot; in ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 493&amp;ndash;495.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hittites]] became well known throughout the ancient world for their prowess with the chariot. Widespread use of the chariot in warfare across most of Eurasia coincides approximately with the development of the [[composite bow]], known from c.&amp;nbsp;1600 BC. Further improvements in wheels and axles, as well as innovations in weaponry, soon resulted in chariots being driven in battle by [[Bronze Age]] societies from China to Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartwick&quot;/&gt;

The [[Hyksos]] invaders brought the chariot to [[Ancient Egypt]] in the 16th century BC and the Egyptians adopted its use from that time forward.&lt;ref&gt;Hitti, ''Lebanon in History'', pp. 77&amp;ndash;78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drower, &quot;Syria&quot; in ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 452, 458.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kupper, &quot;Egypt&quot; in ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest preserved text related to the handling of war horses in the ancient world is the Hittite manual of [[Kikkuli]], which dates to about 1350 BC, and describes the conditioning of chariot horses.&lt;ref name=Chamberlin48/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drower, &quot;Syria&quot; in ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chariots existed in the [[Minoan civilization]], as they were inventoried on storage lists from [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]],&lt;ref name=Life94&gt;Adkins, ''Handbook to Life in Ancient Greece'', pp. 94&amp;ndash;95.&lt;/ref&gt; dating to around 1450 BC.&lt;ref name=Willetts209&gt;Willetts, &quot;Minoans&quot; in ''Penguin Encyclopedia of Ancient Civilizations'' p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Chariots were also used in China as far back as the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1600&amp;ndash;1050 BC), where they appear in burials. The high point of chariot use in China was in the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (770&amp;ndash;476 BC), although they continued in use up until the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name=Dictionary67&gt;Bennett, ''Dictionary of Ancient &amp; Medieval Warfare'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptions of the tactical role of chariots in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] are rare. The [[Iliad]], possibly referring to [[Mycenae]]n practices used c.&amp;nbsp;1250 BC, describes the use of chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle, rather than for actual fighting.&lt;ref name=Life94/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.html|title= The Iliad|accessdate=2011-10-30 |author= Homer|work= The Internet Classics Archive|publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Julius Caesar]], invading Britain in 55 and 54 BC, noted British charioteers throwing javelins, then leaving their chariots to fight on foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10657/10657.txt|title= &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; and Other Commentaries, Chapter 33 |accessdate=2008-07-17 |author= Caius Julius Caesar|work= Project Gutenberg EBook|publisher= Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warry220&gt;Warry, ''Warfare in the Classical World'', pp. 220&amp;ndash;221.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knight-Iran.JPG|thumb|Depiction of a [[Sasanian]] Persian [[Cataphract]] from [[Taq-e Bostan]] ]]
Some of the earliest examples of horses being ridden in warfare were [[Mounted archery|horse-mounted archers]] or spear-throwers, dating to the reigns of the [[Assyria]]n rulers [[Ashurnasirpal II]] and [[Shalmaneser III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trench&quot;/&gt; However, these riders sat far back on their horses, a precarious position for moving quickly, and the horses were held by a handler on the ground, keeping the archer free to use the bow. Thus, these archers were more a type of [[mounted infantry]] than true cavalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hope&quot;/&gt; The Assyrians developed [[cavalry]] in response to invasions by nomadic people from the north, such as the [[Cimmerians]], who entered [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] in the 8th century BC and took over parts of [[Urartu]] during the reign of [[Sargon II]], approximately 721 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, G., ''The Arabian'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Mounted warriors such as the [[Scythians]] also had an influence on the region in the 7th century BC.&lt;ref name=Ellis14&gt;Ellis, ''Cavalry'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; By the reign of [[Ashurbanipal]] in 669 BC, the Assyrians had learned to sit forward on their horses in the classic riding position still seen today and could be said to be true [[light cavalry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hope&quot;/&gt; The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] used both light horse scouts and heavy cavalry,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hope&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trench&quot;/&gt; although not extensively, possibly due to the cost of keeping horses.&lt;ref name=Life94/&gt;

[[Heavy cavalry]] was believed to have been developed by the Ancient [[Persian Empire|Persians]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Trench&quot;/&gt; although others argue for the [[Sarmatians]].&lt;ref name=Perevalov&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perevalov, S.

Once gunpowder was invented, another major use of horses was as [[draft animal|draught animals]] for [[heavy artillery]], or [[cannon]]. In addition to [[field artillery]], where horse-drawn guns were attended by gunners on foot, many armies had [[Artillery battery|artillery batteries]] where each gunner was provided with a mount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nofi124&quot;&gt;Nofi, ''The Waterloo Campaign'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Horse artillery units generally used lighter pieces, pulled by six horses. &quot;9-pounders&quot; were pulled by eight horses, and heavier artillery pieces needed a team of twelve. With the individual riding horses required for officers, surgeons and other support staff, as well as those pulling the artillery guns and supply wagons, an artillery battery of six guns could require 160 to 200 horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nofi130&quot;&gt;Nofi, ''The Waterloo Campaign'', pp. 128&amp;ndash;130.&lt;/ref&gt; Horse artillery usually came under the command of cavalry divisions, but in some battles, such as [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], the horse artillery were used as a rapid response force, repulsing attacks and assisting the infantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH415&quot;&gt;Holmes, ''Military History'', p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;  Agility was important; the ideal artillery horse was 15 to 16 hands high, strongly built, but able to move quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cotner1&quot; /&gt;

{{main|History of the horse in South Asia|}}

The literature of ancient [[India]] describes numerous horse nomads. Some of the earliest references to the use of horses in South Asian warfare are [[Puranas|Puranic]] texts, which refer to an attempted invasion of India by the joint cavalry forces of the [[Saka]]s, [[Kambojas]], [[Yona|Yavanas]], [[The Pahlavas|Pahlavas]], and [[Paradas]], called the &quot;five hordes&quot; (''pañca.ganah'') or &quot;[[Kshatriya|Kśatriya]]&quot; hordes (''Kśatriya ganah''). About 1600 BC, they captured the throne of [[Ayodhya]] by dethroning the [[Vedic period|Vedic]] king, Bahu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Partiger&quot;&gt;Partiger, ''Ancient Indian Historical Tradition'', pp. 147&amp;ndash;148, 182&amp;ndash;183.&lt;/ref&gt; Later texts, such as the [[Mahābhārata]], c.&amp;nbsp;950 BC, appear to recognise efforts taken to [[horse breeding|breed]] war horses and develop trained mounted warriors, stating that the horses of the [[Indus River|Sindhu]] and Kamboja regions were of the finest quality, and the Kambojas, Gandharas, and Yavanas were expert in fighting from horses.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, ''Post-Gupta Polity (A.D. 500-750)'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hopkins, Edward W. |year=1889|number= |title= The Social and Military Position of the Ruling Caste in Ancient India, as Represented by the Sanskrit Epic |journal= Journal of American Oriental Society |volume= 13 | doi = 10.2307/592444|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bongard-Levin, ''Ancient Indian Civilization'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In technological innovation, the early toe loop stirrup is credited to the cultures of India, and may have been in use as early as 500 BC.&lt;ref name=Chamberlin110/&gt; Not long after, the cultures of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Greece]] clashed with those of central Asia and India. [[Herodotus]] (484&amp;ndash;425 BC) wrote that [[Gandhara|Gandarian]] mercenaries of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] were recruited into the army of emperor [[Xerxes I of Persia]] (486&amp;ndash;465 BC), which he led against the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, IV.65&amp;ndash;66.&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, the &quot;Men of the Mountain Land,&quot; from north of [[Kabul River]],{{#tag:ref|Possibly the [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] cavalry, from south of the [[Hindu Kush]] near medieval [[Kohistan District (Pakistan)|Kohistan]]&lt;ref name=Olmstead232&gt;Olmstead, ''History of Persian Empire'', p. 232; Raychaudhuri ''Political History of Ancient India'', p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} served in the army of [[Darius III of Persia]] when he fought against [[Alexander the Great]] at [[Battle of Gaugamela|Arbela]] in 331 BC.&lt;ref name=Olmstead232/&gt; In battle against Alexander at Massaga in 326 BC, the Assakenoi forces included 20,000 cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Sastri, ''Age of the Nandas and Mauryas'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mudrarakshasa|Mudra-Rakshasa]] recounted how cavalry of the Shakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, [[Kirata]]s, [[Saka|Parasika]]s, and [[Bahlikas]] helped [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (c.&amp;nbsp;320&amp;ndash;298 BC) defeat the ruler of [[Magadha]] and take the throne, thus laying the foundations of [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Dynasty]] in Northern India.&lt;ref&gt;Mudra-Rakshasa II.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] cavalry used gunpowder weapons, but were slow to replace the traditional composite bow.&lt;ref name=Gordon230&gt;Gordon, ''The Limited Adoption of European-style Military Forces by Eighteenth Century Rulers in India'', pp. 229&amp;ndash;232.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the impact of European military successes in India, some Indian rulers adopted the European system of massed cavalry charges, although others did not.&lt;ref name=Gordon241&gt;Gordon, ''The Limited Adoption of European-style Military Forces by Eighteenth Century Rulers in India'', p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century, Indian armies continued to field cavalry, but mainly of the heavy variety.

===East Asia===
[[File:Yabusame00.jpg|thumb|Yabusame archers, [[Edo period]]]]
{{main|Horses in East Asian warfare}}
The Chinese used [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]s for horse-based warfare until light cavalry forces became common during the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] era (402&amp;ndash;221 BC). A major proponent of the change to riding horses from chariots was [[King Wuling of Zhao|Wu Ling]], c.&amp;nbsp;320 BC. However, conservative forces in China often opposed change, and cavalry never became as dominant as in Europe. Cavalry in China also did not benefit from the additional cachet attached to being the military branch dominated by the nobility.&lt;ref name=Ellis19&gt;Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp. 19&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese [[samurai]]  fought as cavalry for many centuries.&lt;ref name=Turnbull15&gt;Turnbull, ''War in Japan'', pp. 15&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt; They were particularly skilled in the art of using archery from horseback. The archery skills of mounted samurai were developed by training such as [[Yabusame]], which originated in 530 AD and reached its peak under [[Minamoto Yoritomo]] (1147&amp;ndash;1199 AD) in the [[Kamakura Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yabusame.or.jp/english/html/t_Trekishi_E.html |title=The History of the Takeda school Kyuubadou |publisher=The Takeda School of Horseback Archery |accessdate=2008-11-35 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518050330/http://www.yabusame.or.jp/english/html/t_Trekishi_E.html |archivedate=May 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They switched from an emphasis on [[Mounted archery|mounted bowmen]] to mounted spearmen during the [[Sengoku period]] (1467&amp;ndash;1615 AD).

===Middle East===

[[File:Higueruela.jpg|thumb|upright|Spanish and Moorish light cavalry ([[jinetes]]) skirmish at the 1431 [[Battle of La Higueruela]]]]

During the period when various [[Caliphate|Islamic empires]] controlled much of the [[Middle East]] as well as parts of [[West Africa]] and the [[Iberian peninsula]], [[Muslim]] armies consisted mostly of cavalry, made up of fighters from various local groups, [[mercenary|mercenaries]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] tribesmen. The latter were considered particularly skilled as both lancers and mounted archers. In the 9th century the use of [[Mamluk]]s, slaves raised to be soldiers for various Muslim rulers, became increasingly common.&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, ''The Medieval Warhorse'', pp. 108&amp;ndash;110.&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile tactics, advanced [[selective breeding|breeding]] of horses, and detailed training manuals made Mamluk cavalry a highly efficient fighting force.&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, ''The Medieval Warhorse'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; The use of armies consisting mostly of cavalry continued among the Turkish people who founded the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Their need for large mounted forces lead to an establishment of the [[sipahi]], cavalry soldiers who were granted lands in exchange for providing [[military service]] in times of war.&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, ''The Warhorse 1250–1600'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Mounted Muslim warriors conquered North Africa and the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the 7th and 8th centuries AD following the Hegira, or [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]], of [[Muhammad]] in 622 AD. By 630 AD, their influence expanded across the [[Middle East]] and into western [[North Africa]]. By 711 AD, the light cavalry of Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and controlled most of the Iberian peninsula by 720.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Conquerors'', pp. 97&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt; Their mounts were of various oriental types, including the North African [[Barb (horse)|Barb]]. A few [[Arabian horse]]s may have come with the [[Ummayad]]s who settled in the [[Guadalquivir]] valley.

During the European [[Middle Ages]], there were three primary types of war horses: The [[destrier]], the [[Courser (horse)|courser]], and the [[rouncey]], which differed in size and usage. A generic word used to describe medieval war horses was ''charger,'' which appears interchangeable with the other terms.&lt;ref name=Prestwich347&gt;Prestwich, ''Armies and Warfare'', p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval war horse was of moderate size, rarely exceeding {{hands|15.2}}. Heavy horses were logistically difficult to maintain and less adaptable to varied terrains.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH416&quot;/&gt; The destrier of the [[early Middle Ages]] was moderately larger than the courser or rouncey, in part to accommodate heavier armoured [[knight]]s.&lt;ref name=France23&gt;France, ''Western Warfare'', pp. 23&amp;ndash;25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, destriers were not as large as [[draft horse|draught horses]], averaging between {{hands|14.2}} and {{hands|15}}.&lt;ref name=Hyland85&gt;Hyland, ''The Medieval Warhorse'', pp. 85&amp;ndash;86.&lt;/ref&gt; On the European continent, the need to carry more armour against mounted enemies such as the [[Lombards]] and [[Frisians]] led to the [[Franks]] developing heavier, bigger horses.&lt;ref name=Ellis47&gt;Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp. 47&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the amount of armour and equipment increased in the later Middle Ages, the height of the horses increased; some late medieval horse skeletons were of horses over 15 hands.&lt;ref name=France23/&gt;

[[Stallion (horse)|Stallions]] were often used as destriers due to their natural aggression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bumke&quot;&gt;Bumke, ''Courtly Culture'', pp.&amp;nbsp;175–178.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there may have been some use of [[mare]]s by European warriors,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bumke&quot;/&gt; and mares, who were quieter and less likely to call out and betray their position to the enemy, were the preferred war horse of the [[Moors]], who invaded various parts of Southern Europe from 700 AD through the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, G., ''The Arabian'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gelding]]s were used in war by the [[Teutonic Knights]], and known as &quot;monk horses&quot; (German ''Mönchpferde'' or ''Mönchhengste''). One advantage was if captured by the enemy, they could not be used to improve local bloodstock, thus maintaining the Knights' superiority in horseflesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ekdahl|first1= Sven|editor1-first= Helen |editor1-last= Nicholson|title=The Military Orders |type= |edition= |series= |volume= 2 Welfare and Warfare|date= |year=1998 |month= |origyear= |publisher= Ashgate|location= Farnham, Surrey|isbn=978-0-86078-679-5|page= |pages= |trans_chapter= |chapter=Horses and Crossbows: Two Important Warfare Advantages of the Teutonic Order in Prussia  |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uses====
The heavy cavalry charge, while it could be effective, was not a common occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich, ''Armies and Warfare in the Middle Ages'', p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;  Battles were rarely fought on land suitable for heavy cavalry. While mounted riders remained effective for initial attacks,&lt;ref&gt;Barber, ''The Reign of Chivalry'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the 14th century, it was common for knights to dismount to fight,&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich, ''Armies and Warfare'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; while their horses were sent to the rear, kept ready for pursuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sadler32&quot;&gt;Sadler, ''Border Fury'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pitched battle]]s were avoided if possible, with most offensive [[Medieval warfare|warfare]] in the early Middle Ages taking the form of [[siege]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and others, ''Fighting Techniques of the Medieval World'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the later Middle Ages as mounted raids called ''[[chevauchée]]s'', with lightly armed warriors on swift horses.{{#tag:ref|Chevauchées were the preferred form of warfare for the English during the [[Hundred Years' War]]&lt;ref&gt;See for example Barber. ''The Reign of Chivalry'' pp. 34&amp;ndash;38.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scots in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Wars of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich, ''Armies and Warfare in the Middle Ages'', pp. 10, 198&amp;ndash;200.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}
[[File:Jousting renfair.jpg|thumb|[[Jousting]] is a [[hastilude|sport]] that evolved out of [[heavy cavalry]] practice.]]

The war horse was also seen in [[hastilude]]s—martial war games such as the [[joust]], which  began in the 11th century both as sport and to provide training for battle.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, ''The Tournament in England'', pp. 4&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialised destriers were bred for the purpose,&lt;ref name=Hyland88&gt;Hyland, ''The Medieval Warhorse'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; although the expense of keeping, training, and outfitting them kept the majority of the population from owning one.&lt;ref name=Ellis43&gt;Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp. 43, 49&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt; While some historians suggest that the tournament had become a theatrical event by the 15th and 16th centuries, others argue that [[jousting]] continued to help cavalry train for battle until the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref name=Tournaments&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watanabe-O'Kelly, Helen |title=Tournaments and their Relevance for Warfare in the Early Modern Period |journal=European History Quarterly |issue=20 |year=1990 |pages=451–463 |doi=10.1177/026569149002000401 |volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition====
The decline of the armoured knight was probably linked to changing structures of armies and various economic factors, and not obsolescence due to new technologies. However, some historians attribute the demise of the knight to the invention of [[gunpowder]],&lt;ref name=Hale54&gt;Hale, ''War and Society'', pp. 54&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt; or to the [[English longbow]].&lt;ref name=Ellis65&gt;Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp. 65&amp;ndash;67.&lt;/ref&gt; Some link the decline to both technologies.&lt;ref name=Techniques123&gt;Bennett, ''Medieval Fighting Techniques'', pp. 123&amp;ndash;124.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others argue these technologies actually contributed to the development of knights:  [[plate armour]] was first developed to resist early medieval [[crossbow]] bolts,&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;Williams, &quot;The Metallurgy of Medieval Arms and Armour&quot; in ''Companion to Medieval Arms and Armour'', pp. 51&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; and the full harness worn by the early 15th century developed to resist longbow arrows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey&quot;/&gt; From the 14th century on, most plate was made from hardened steel, which resisted early musket ammunition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;/&gt; In addition, stronger designs did not make plate heavier; a full harness of musket-proof plate from the 17th century weighed {{convert|70|lb|kg}}, significantly less than 16th century tournament armour.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, ''A Knight and his Horse'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The move to predominately infantry-based battles from 1300 to 1550 was linked to both improved [[infantry tactics]] and changes in [[List of medieval weapons|weaponry]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and others, ''Fighting Techniques of the Medieval World'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, the concept of a combined-arms professional army had spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey&quot;&gt;Carey and others, ''Warfare in the Medieval World'', pp. 149&amp;ndash;50, 200&amp;ndash;02.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional armies emphasized training, and were paid via contracts, a change from the ransom and pillaging which reimbursed knights in the past.  When coupled with the rising costs involved in outfitting and maintaining armour and horses, the traditional knightly classes began to abandon their profession.&lt;ref&gt;Robards, ''The Medieval Knight at War'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;  Light horses, or ''prickers'', were still used for scouting and reconnaissance; they also provided a defensive screen for marching armies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sadler32&quot;/&gt;  Large teams of draught horses or [[oxen]] pulled the heavy early [[cannon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, ''Border Fury'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other horses pulled wagons and carried supplies for the armies.

===Early modern period===
During the [[early modern period]] the shift continued from heavy cavalry and the armoured knight to unarmoured [[light cavalry]], including [[Hussars]] and [[Chasseurs à cheval]].&lt;ref name=Cowley&gt;{{cite book |title=The Reader's Companion to Military History |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-618-12742-9|page=215 |author1=Cowley, Robert  |author2=Geoffrey Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Light cavalry facilitated better communication, using fast, agile horses to move quickly across battlefields.&lt;ref name=Ellis98&gt;Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp. 98&amp;ndash;103.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio of footmen to horsemen also increased over the period as infantry weapons improved and footmen became more mobile and versatile, particularly once the musket [[bayonet]] replaced the more cumbersome pike.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Seven Ages of the British Army'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Elizabethan era]], mounted units included [[cuirassier]]s, heavily armoured and equipped with lances; light cavalry, who wore mail and bore light lances and pistols; and &quot;[[petronel]]s&quot;, who carried an early [[carbine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ages32&quot;&gt;Carver, ''Seven Ages of the British Army'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; As heavy cavalry use declined armour was increasingly abandoned and [[dragoon]]s, whose horses were rarely used in combat, became more common: [[mounted infantry]] provided reconnaissance, escort and security.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ages32&quot;/&gt;  However, many generals still used the heavy mounted charge, from the late 17th century and early 18th century, where sword-wielding wedge-formation shock troops penetrated enemy lines,&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Seven Ages of the British Army'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; to the early 19th century, where armoured heavy cuirassiers were employed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH188&quot;&gt;Holmes, ''Military History'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Light cavalry continued to play a major role, particularly after the [[Seven Years' War]] when Hussars started to play a larger part in battles.&lt;ref name=Hollins&gt;{{cite book |title=Hungarian Hussar 1756–1815 |publisher=Osprey |year=2003 |isbn= 1-84176-524-4|page=5 |author1=Hollins, Emir  |author2=Darko Pavlovic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some leaders preferred tall horses for their mounted troops this was as much for prestige as for increased shock ability and many troops used more typical horses, averaging 15 hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH416&quot;&gt;Holmes, ''Military History'', p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cavalry tactics altered with fewer mounted charges, more reliance on drilled manoeuvres  at the [[trot (horse gait)|trot]], and use of firearms once within range.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Seven Ages of the British Army'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ever-more elaborate movements, such as wheeling and [[caracole]], were developed  to facilitate the use of firearms from horseback. These tactics were not greatly successful in battle since [[pikemen]] protected by [[musketeers]] could deny cavalry room to manoeuvre. However the advanced [[equestrianism]] required survives into the modern world as [[dressage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dressage.ponyclub.org/PDFs/Articles/history%20of%20dressage%20by%20rebecca%20barber.pdf |title=The History of Classical Horsemanship |work= |accessdate=2010-09-19 |author=Barber, Rebecca A. |publisher=United States Pony Clubs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727182012/http://www.dressage.ponyclub.org/PDFs/Articles/history%20of%20dressage%20by%20rebecca%20barber.pdf |archivedate=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan341&quot;&gt;Keegan, ''History of Warfare'', p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;  While restricted, cavalry was not rendered obsolete. As infantry formations developed in tactics and skills, artillery became essential to break formations; in turn, cavalry was required to both combat enemy artillery, which was susceptible to cavalry while deploying, and to charge enemy infantry formations broken by artillery fire. Thus, successful warfare depended in a balance of the three arms: cavalry, artillery and infantry.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, ''History of Warfare'', p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

As regimental structures developed many units selected horses of uniform type and some, such as the [[Royal Scots Greys]], even specified colour. Trumpeters often rode distinctive horses so they stood out. Regional armies developed type preferences, such as British [[field hunter|hunters]], [[Hanoverian (horse)|Hanoverians]] in central Europe, and [[Russian Don|steppe ponies]] of the [[Cossack]]s, but once in the field, the lack of supplies typical of wartime meant that horses of all types were used.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH417&quot;&gt;Holmes, ''Military History'', p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since horses were such a vital component of most armies in early modern Europe, many instituted [[Stud farm#State stud farms|state stud farms]] to breed horses for the military. However, in wartime, supply rarely matched the demand, resulting in some cavalry troops fighting on foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH416&quot;/&gt;

===19th century===
{{see also|Horses in the Napoleonic Wars}}
[[File:Ludwig Elsholtz Napoleon I. mit seinen Generalen.jpg|thumb|&quot;[[Napoleon I]] with his Generals&quot; by [[Ludwig Elsholtz]]. This painting shows light cavalry horses which come into use as officer's mounts in 18th- and 19th-century Europe.]]

In the 19th century distinctions between heavy and light cavalry became less significant; by the end of the [[Peninsular War]], heavy cavalry were performing the scouting and outpost duties previously undertaken by light cavalry, and by the end of the 19th century the roles had effectively merged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colonial25&quot;&gt;Haythornthwaite, ''The Colonial Wars Source Book'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Most armies at the time preferred cavalry horses to stand {{hands|15.2}} and weigh {{convert|990|to|1100|lb|kg}}, although [[cuirassier]]s frequently had heavier horses. Lighter horses were used for scouting and raiding. Cavalry horses were generally obtained at 5 years of age and were in service from 10 or 12 years, barring loss. However losses of 30–40% were common during a campaign due to conditions of the march as well as enemy action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nofi109&quot;&gt;Nofi, ''The Waterloo Campaign'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mares and [[gelding]]s were preferred over less-easily managed stallions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nofi108&quot;&gt;Nofi, ''The Waterloo Campaign'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the cavalry's main offensive role was as shock troops. In defence cavalry were used to attack and harass the enemy's infantry flanks as they advanced. Cavalry were frequently used prior to an infantry assault, to force an infantry line to break and reform into formations vulnerable to infantry or artillery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nofi204&quot;&gt;Nofi, ''The Waterloo Campaign'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Infantry frequently followed behind in order to secure any ground won&lt;ref name=&quot;Nofi1756&quot;&gt;Nofi, ''The Waterloo Campaign'', pp. 175&amp;ndash;176.&lt;/ref&gt; or the cavalry could be used to break up enemy lines following a successful infantry action.

Mounted charges were carefully managed. A charge's maximum speed was 20&amp;nbsp;km/h; moving faster resulted in a break in formation and fatigued horses. Charges occurred across clear rising ground, and were effective against infantry both on the march and when deployed in a [[Line (formation)|line]] or [[Column (formation)|column]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nofi176&quot;&gt;Nofi, ''The Waterloo Campaign'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  A foot [[battalion]] formed in line was vulnerable to cavalry, and could be broken or destroyed by a well-formed charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hay12&quot;&gt;Haythornthwaite, ''British Infantry of the Napoleonic Wars'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional cavalry functions altered by the end of the 19th century. Many cavalry units transferred in title and role to &quot;mounted rifles&quot;:&amp;nbsp;troops trained to fight on foot, but retaining mounts for rapid deployment, as well as for patrols, scouting, communications, and defensive screening. These troops differed from [[mounted infantry]], who used horses for transport but did not perform the old cavalry roles of reconnaissance and support.&lt;ref&gt;Kinloch, ''Echoes of Gallipoli'', p. 18&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-Saharan Africa==
[[File:Group of Kanem-Bu warriors.jpg|thumb|right|Kanem-Bu warriors armed with spears. ''The Earth and Its Inhabitants'', 1892.]]
Horses were used for warfare in the central [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] since the 9th century, where they were considered &quot;the most precious commodity following the slave.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Azevedo, ''Roots of Violence'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The first conclusive evidence of horses playing a major role in the warfare of [[West Africa]] dates to the 11th century when the region was controlled by the [[Almoravid]]s, a Muslim [[Berber people|Berber]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Law, ''The Horse in West African History'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 13th and 14th centuries, cavalry became an important factor in the area. This coincided with the introduction of larger breeds of horse and the widespread adoption of saddles and stirrups.&lt;ref&gt;Law, ''The Horse in West African History'', pp. 127–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased mobility played a part in the formation of new power centers, such as the [[Oyo Empire]] in what today is [[Nigeria]]. The authority of many African Islamic states such as the [[Bornu Empire]] also rested in large part on their ability to subject neighboring peoples with cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Law, ''The Horse in West African History'', pp. 176–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite harsh climate conditions, endemic diseases such as [[trypanosomiasis]] the [[African horse sickness]] and unsuitable terrain that limited the effectiveness of horses in many parts of Africa, horses were continuously imported and were, in some areas, a vital instrument of war.&lt;ref&gt;Law, ''The Horse in West African History'', p. 76–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of horses also intensified existing conflicts, such as those between the [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people]] in Namibia during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cocker, ''Rivers of Blood, Rivers of Gold'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

The African slave trade was closely tied to the imports of war horses, and as the prevalence of slaving decreased, fewer horses were needed for raiding.  This significantly decreased the amount of mounted warfare seen in West Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Law176&quot;&gt;Law, ''The Horse in West African History'', pp. 176–77.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[Scramble for Africa]] and the introduction of modern firearms in the 1880s, the use of horses in African warfare had lost most of its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Law176&quot;/&gt;  Nonetheless, in [[South Africa]] during the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), cavalry and other mounted troops were the major combat force for the British, since the horse-mounted Boers moved too quickly for infantry to engage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinloch20&quot;&gt;Kinloch, ''Echoes of Gallipoli'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The Boers presented a mobile and innovative approach to warfare, drawing on strategies that had first appeared in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pakenham, ''The Boer War'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  The terrain was not well-suited to the British horses, resulting in the loss of over 300,000 animals. As the campaign wore on, losses were replaced by more durable African [[Basuto pony|Basuto ponies]], and [[Waler horse]]s from [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MH416&quot;/&gt;

==The Americas==

[[File:Comanche Osage fight.jpg|thumb|right|[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s quickly adopted the horse and were highly effective light cavalry. ''Comanche-Osage fight.'' [[George Catlin]], 1834]]

The horse had been extinct in the [[Western Hemisphere]] for approximately 10,000 years prior to the arrival of Spanish [[Conquistador]]s in the early 16th century. Consequently, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] had no warfare technologies that could overcome the considerable advantage provided by European horses and gunpowder weapons. In particular this resulted in the conquest of the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization|Inca]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Conquerors'', pp. 195, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  The speed and increased impact of cavalry contributed to a number of early victories by European fighters in open terrain, though their success was limited in more mountainous regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker143&quot;&gt;Parker, ''Warfare'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Incas' well-maintained roads in the [[Andes]] enabled quick mounted raids, such as those undertaken by the Spanish while resisting the  [[siege of Cuzco]] in 1536&amp;ndash;7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker143&quot;/&gt;

Indigenous populations of South America soon learned to use horses. In Chile, the [[Mapuche]] began using cavalry in the [[Arauco War]] in 1586. They drove the Spanish out of [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía]] at the beginning of the 17th century.  Later, the Mapuche conducted mounted raids known as [[Malón]]es, first on Spanish, then on Chilean and Argentine settlements until well into the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, &quot;Warfare Reorganization and Readaptation at the Margins of Spanish Rule&quot; in ''The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas'', pp. 138&amp;ndash;187.&lt;/ref&gt;  In North America, [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] also quickly learned to use horses. In particular, the people of the [[Great Plains]], such as the [[Comanche]] and the [[Cheyenne]], became renowned horseback fighters. By the 19th century, they presented a formidable force against the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref name=Ellis156&gt;Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp. 156&amp;ndash;163.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
Although cavalry was used extensively throughout the world during the 19th century, horses became less important to warfare after the beginning of the 20th century. [[Light cavalry]] was still seen on the battlefield at the beginning of the 20th century, but formal mounted cavalry began to be phased out for combat during and immediately after [[World War I]], although units that included horses still had military uses well into [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Waller&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qmfound.com/horse.htm|author= Waller, Anna L. |title=Horses and Mules and National Defense|year= 1958|accessdate=2008-07-17|work=Office of the Quartermaster General|publisher=Army Quartermaster Foundation, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Horses in World War I}}
[[World War I]] saw great changes in the use of cavalry. The mode of warfare changed, and the use of [[trench warfare]], [[barbed wire]] and [[machine gun]]s rendered traditional cavalry almost obsolete. [[Tank]]s, introduced in 1917, began to take over the role of shock combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carver123&quot;&gt;Carver, ''Britain's Army in the 20th Century'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the War, cavalry skirmishes were common, and horse-mounted troops widely used for reconnaissance.&lt;ref name=&quot;WILL46&quot;&gt;Willmott, ''First World War'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] cavalry were an effective flanking force during the &quot;[[Race to the Sea]]&quot; in 1914, but were less useful once [[trench warfare]] was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;WILL60&quot;&gt;Willmott, ''First World War'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WILL99&quot;&gt;Willmott, ''First World War'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; There a few examples of successful shock combat, and cavalry divisions also provided important mobile firepower.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH188&quot;/&gt; Cavalry played a greater role on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], where trench warfare was less common.&lt;ref name=&quot;WILL99&quot;/&gt;  On the Eastern Front, and also against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the &quot;cavalry was literally indispensable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MH188&quot;/&gt; [[British Empire]] cavalry proved adaptable, since they were trained to fight both on foot and while mounted, while other European cavalry relied primarily on shock action.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH188&quot;/&gt;

On both fronts, the horse was also used as a [[packhorse|pack animal]]. Because railway lines could not withstand artillery bombardments, horses carried ammunition and supplies between the railheads and the rear trenches, though the horses generally were not used in the actual trench zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORYKEEGAN308&quot;&gt;Keegan, ''A History of Warfare'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; This role of horses was critical, and thus horse [[fodder]] was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORYKEEGAN308&quot;/&gt; Following the war, many cavalry regiments were converted to mechanised, armoured divisions, with light tanks developed to perform many of the cavalry's original roles.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Britain's Army in the 20th Century'', pp. 7, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:PolishCavalryAttack.jpg|thumb|Polish Cavalry during a [[Polish Army]] manoeuvre in late 1930s.]]
{{main|Horses in World War II}}
Several nations used horse units during [[World War II]]. The [[Poland|Polish]] army used cavalry to defend against the armies of [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|1939 invasion]].&lt;ref name=Davies324&gt;Davies, ''God's Playground Volume II'', pp. 324&amp;ndash;325.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the Germans and the [[Red Army|Soviet Union]] maintained cavalry units throughout the war,&lt;ref name=&quot;MH417&quot;/&gt; particularly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MH188&quot;/&gt;  The British Army used horses early in the war, and the final British cavalry charge was on March 21, 1942, when the Burma Frontier Force encountered [[Japan]]ese infantry in central [[Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''Encyclopedia of World War II'', p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The only American cavalry unit during World War II was the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry]]. They challenged the Japanese invaders of [[Luzon]], holding off armoured and infantry regiments during the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941–42)|invasion of the Philippines]], repelled a unit of tanks in [[Binalonan]], and successfully held ground for the Allied armies' retreat to [[Battle of Bataan|Bataan]].&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, ''The United States Cavalry'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the war, horses and mules were an essential form of transport, especially by the British in the rough terrain of Italy and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams-museum.org.uk/historyRAVC.htm|title=History of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps|accessdate=2008-07-18|author=Army Medical Services Museum|work=RAVC History|publisher=Army Medical Services Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army utilised a few cavalry and supply units during the war, but there were concerns that the Americans did not use horses often enough. In the campaigns in [[North Africa]], generals such as [[George S. Patton]] lamented their lack, saying, &quot;had we possessed an American cavalry division with pack artillery in Tunisia and in Sicily, not a German would have escaped.&quot;&lt;ref name=Waller/&gt;

The German and the Soviet armies used horses until the end of the war for transportation of troops and supplies. The German Army, strapped for motorised transport because its factories were needed to produce tanks and aircraft, used around 2.75 million horses—more than it had used in World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORYKEEGAN308&quot;/&gt; One German infantry division in Normandy in 1944 had 5,000 horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH417&quot;/&gt; The Soviets used 3.5 million horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORYKEEGAN308&quot;/&gt;

==Recognition==
[[File:Horse Memorial-002.jpg|thumb|A memorial to the horses that served in the [[Second Boer War]].]]
While many statues and memorials have been erected to human heroes of war, often shown with horses, a few have also been created specifically to honor horses or animals in general.  One example is the [[Horse Memorial]] in [[Port Elizabeth]] in the [[Eastern Cape]] province of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sahra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://196.35.231.29/sahra/HeritageSitesDetail.aspx?id=21179|title=Horse Memorial|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]]|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both horses and mules are honored in the [[Animals in War Memorial]] in [[Hyde Park, London|London's Hyde Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4037873.stm |title=Animal war heroes statue unveiled |publisher = BBC News| date=2004-11-24| accessdate=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses have also at times received medals for extraordinary deeds. After the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] during the [[Crimean War]], a surviving horse named Drummer Boy, ridden by an officer of the [[8th King's Royal Irish Hussars|8th Hussars]], was given an unofficial campaign medal by his rider that was identical to those awarded to British troops who served in the Crimea, engraved with the horse's name and an inscription of his service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458954/War-horses-medal-from-valley-of-death-up-for-sale.html |title=War horse's medal from valley of death up for sale |author= Bennett, Will |publisher=  Telegraph.co.uk | date= 2004-04-04 |accessdate= 2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more formal award was the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals|PDSA]] [[Dickin Medal]], an animals' equivalent of the [[Victoria Cross]], awarded by the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] charity in the United Kingdom to three horses that served in World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;

==Modern uses==
[[File:US Special Forces on horseback, Afghanistan, 2001.jpg|thumb|Afghan and United States military forces on horseback in [[Afghanistan]], 2001]]

Today, many of the historical military uses of the horse have evolved into peacetime applications, including exhibitions, [[historical reenactment]]s, work of [[law enforcement officer|peace officer]]s, and competitive events. Formal combat units of mounted cavalry are mostly a thing of the past, with horseback units within the modern military used for reconnaissance, ceremonial, or crowd control purposes. With the rise of mechanised technology, horses in formal national militias were displaced by [[tank]]s and [[armored fighting vehicle]]s, sometimes still referred to as &quot;cavalry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Bielakowski, Alexander M. |date=Jan 2007|title= General Hawkins's war: The Future of the Horse in the U.S. Cavalry |journal= The Journal of Military History |volume=  71| issue = 1|page=137 |doi=10.1353/jmh.2007.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active military===
Organised armed fighters on horseback are occasionally seen. The best-known current examples are the [[Janjaweed]], militia groups seen in the [[Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]], who became notorious for their attacks upon unarmed civilian populations in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lacey, Marc|date= May 4, 2004|number= |title= In Sudan, Militiamen on Horses Uproot a Million |journal= New York Times|volume= |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/04/international/africa/04DARF.html?ex=1399003200&amp;en=b72ea0a4b892076d&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND |accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations still maintain small numbers of mounted military units for certain types of patrol and reconnaissance duties in extremely rugged terrain, including the conflict in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pelton, Robert Young |date=Feb 15, 2002|title= Afghan War Eyewitness on Warlords, Future, More |journal= National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0215_020215_peltoninterview.html|accessdate=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law enforcement and public safety===
[[File:Policja konna Poznań.jpg|thumb|upright|Mounted police in [[Poznań]], [[Poland]]]]
{{Main|Mounted police|Mounted search and rescue}}

[[Mounted police]] have been used since the 18th century, and still are used worldwide to control traffic and crowds, patrol public parks, keep order in processionals and during ceremonies and perform general street patrol duties. Today, many cities still have mounted police units. In rural areas, horses are used by law enforcement for mounted patrols over rugged terrain, crowd control at religious shrines, and border patrol.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, E., ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural areas, law enforcement that operates outside of incorporated cities may also have mounted units. These include specially deputised, paid or volunteer [[mounted search and rescue]] units sent into roadless areas on horseback to locate missing people.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite web |url= http://www.nwhsar.org/|title= Northwest Horseback Search and Rescue|accessdate=2008-07-17 |author=Northwest Horseback Search and Rescue |work= NHSR Website|publisher=Northwest Horseback Search and Rescue }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement in [[protected area]]s may use horses in places where mechanised transport is difficult or prohibited. Horses can be an essential part of an overall team effort as they can move faster on the ground than a human on foot, can transport heavy equipment, and provide a more rested rescue worker when a subject is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nwhsar.org/pages/whyhorseback.html|title= Why Search on Horseback?|accessdate=2006-11-09 |author=Northwest Horseback Search and Rescue |work= NHSR Website|publisher=Northwest Horseback Search and Rescue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonial and educational uses===
{{See also|Historical reenactment}}
[[File:Charge3.jpg|thumb|Horse Cavalry Detachment of the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division demonstrating a mock cavalry charge at [[Fort Bliss, Texas]]]]

Many countries throughout the world maintain traditionally trained and historically uniformed cavalry units for ceremonial, exhibition, or educational purposes. One example is the Horse Cavalry Detachment of the U.S. Army's [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hood.army.mil/1stcavdiv/horseDet/history.asp |title=Horse Cavalry Detachment |accessdate=2008-07-17 |author=First Cavalry Division |work=FCD Website |publisher=First Cavalry Division |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614014807/http://www.hood.army.mil/1stcavdiv/horseDet/history.asp |archivedate=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This unit of active duty soldiers approximates the weapons, tools, equipment and techniques used by the United States Cavalry in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubbell&quot;/&gt; It is seen at change of command ceremonies and other public appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubbell&quot;/&gt; A similar detachment is the [[Governor General's Horse Guards]], Canada's [[Household Cavalry]] regiment, the last remaining mounted cavalry unit in the Canadian Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/gghg/regiment/cavalry-cavalerie-eng.asp|title= Governor General's Horse Guards|accessdate=2012-03-20 |author= Canadian Department of National Defense|work= Canadian National Defense Website|publisher= Canadian Department of National Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf|title= The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces|accessdate=2008-07-18|date=1999-01-04 |author= Canadian Department of National Defense|work= The Saskatchewan Dragoons Website|publisher= Canadian Department of National Defense|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nepal]]'s King's Household Cavalry is a ceremonial unit with over 100 horses and is the remainder of the Nepalese cavalry that existed since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Haviland, Charles|date=June 8, 2008|title= Nepalese cavalry to be relocated|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7442323.stm|accessdate=2008-08-07|journal= BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important ceremonial use is in military funerals, which often have a [[caparisoned horse]] as part of the procession, &quot;to symbolize that the warrior will never ride again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=26315|title=Military to Support Reagan Funeral|work=American Forces Press Service News Articles|accessdate=2008-12-16|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equestrian sport===
{{Main|Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Dressage|Show jumping|Eventing}}
Modern-day Olympic equestrian events are rooted in cavalry skills and classical horsemanship.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, ''Olympic Equestrian'', pp. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt; The first equestrian events at the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] were introduced in 1912, and through 1948, competition was restricted to active-duty officers on military horses.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards &amp; Geddes, ''The Complete Horse Book'', p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Only after 1952, as mechanisation of warfare reduced the number of military riders, were civilian riders allowed to compete.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards &amp; Geddes, ''The Complete Horse Book'', p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSKUA76733420080807|title=Factbox for Equestrianism|work=Reuters Website|accessdate=2008-08-07|author=Reuters|date=August 7, 2008|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dressage traces its origins to [[Xenophon]] and his works on cavalry training methods, developing further during the [[Renaissance]] in response to a need for different tactics in battles where firearms were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitingvienna.com/sights/other/spanishridingschool/history/ |title=History of the Spanish Riding School |work=Visiting Vienna|accessdate=2008-07-21|author=Brownlow, Mark|publisher=Mark Brownlow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-phase competition known as [[Eventing]] developed out of cavalry officers' needs for versatile, well-schooled horses.&lt;ref&gt;Price &amp; Burt, ''The American Quarter Horse'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[show jumping]] developed largely from [[fox hunting]], the cavalry considered jumping to be good training for their horses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/equestrian/story/2008/05/02/f-olympics-equestrian-history-showjumping.html| title=Gold, silver, bronze?
