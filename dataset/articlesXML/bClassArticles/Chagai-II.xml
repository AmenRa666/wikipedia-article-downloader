'''Chagai-II''' is the [[codename]] assigned to the second [[Atomic tests|atomic test]] conducted by [[Pakistan]], carried out on 30 May 1998 in the [[Kharan Desert]] in Balochistan Province of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Govt. of Balochistan, Pakistan studies&quot; /&gt; ''Chagai-II'' took place two days after Pakistan's first successful [[nuclear test|test]], ''[[Chagai-I]]'', which was carried out on 28 May 1998 in the [[Ras Koh Hills|Ras Koh area]] in [[Chagai District]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan]].

The initial goals were to test the new designs of the weapon rather than studying the effects, and were different from the first tests in that they were primarily conducted by the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC), with the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] [[Military engineering|engineering formations]] having only a supporting role.&lt;ref name=&quot;PakDef, original aired on GEO TV in 2005&quot; /&gt;

The tests detonated [[Implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion-type]] [[Boosted fission weapon|boosted-fission]] [[Weapon-grade#plutonium|military-grade plutonium]] devices, contrary to the [[Chagai-I]] tests that were [[weapons-grade uranium]] devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;PakDef, original aired on GEO TV in 2005&quot; /&gt; The performance of these tests made it a total of six tests performed by Pakistan in May 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;PakDef, original aired on GEO TV in 2005&quot; /&gt;

==Test preparations==

===Selection and planning===

The [[Kharan Desert]] is a [[Dune|sandy]] and [[Mountain ranges of Pakistan|mountainous]] desert, with very high temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Federation of American Scientsits&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=FAS|title=Kharan Desert|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/pakistan/facility/kharan.htm|website=https://fas.org/|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is characterised by very low rainfall, high summer temperature, high velocity winds, poor soils, very sparse vegetation and a low diversity of plant species; its average temperature are recorded  {{convert|55|C|F}} in summer and  {{convert|2.5|C|F}} in winter session (sources vary).&lt;ref name=&quot;Govt. of Balochistan, Pakistan studies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Govt. of Balochistan, Pakistan|title=District Profile: Kharan|url=http://balochistan.gov.pk/DistrictProfile/DDP%20Final%202012/Kharan/Kharan.pdf|website=http://balochistan.gov.pk/|publisher=Govt. of Balochistan, Pakistan studies|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kharan documentary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Kharan documentary|url=http://www.slideshare.net/arslan6575/kharan-desert|publisher=Kharan documentary|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pakistan 360&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pakistan 360|title=Kharan Desert|url=http://pakistan360degrees.com/tag/desert/|website=http://pakistan360degrees.com/|publisher=Pakistan 360|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mares|1999|pp=301–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety and security required an isolated, remote, and [[Residency (domicile)|inhabitant]] area with [[List of extreme weather records in Pakistan|extreme weather]] conditions to prevent any possible [[Radioactive Fallout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rehman|1999|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Geological survey|survey]] was commenced by nuclear physicist Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] assisted by [[seismologist]] Dr. Ahsan Mubarak; it received final approval from [[Munir Ahmad Khan|Munir Ahmad]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation (1999) and Defence Journal of Pakistan (2000)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Azam|first=Rai Muhammad Saleh |title=When Mountains Move|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/june/chaghi.htm |work=Rai Muhammad Saleh Azam |publisher=The Nation (1999) and Defence Journal (2000) |accessdate=8 May 2012 |location=Karachi, Pakistan|pages=1|date=June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[granite]] mountains, the PAEC requirement was to find a suitable site in a desert region with almost no wildlife to prevent any kind of [[mutation]], and to study blast effects of the weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Khan|2012|pp=280–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weapon-testing sites were suspected to be located at [[Kharan Desert|Kharan]], in a desert valley between the [[Ras Koh Hills|Ras Koh]] region to the north and [[Siahan Range]] to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Sublette of the nuclear weapon archive&quot;/&gt; Subsequently, the [[Chagai Hills|Chagai]]-[[Ras Koh]]-Kharan were cordoned off, becoming restricted entry zones closed to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Sublette of the nuclear weapon archive&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sublette  |first =Carey |title=Historical Background:§Preparing to Build the Bomb | work =Nuclear Weapon Archive  |publisher =nuclearweaponarchive.org  |date=2 January 2002  | url =http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Pakistan/PakOrigin.html |accessdate =2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nuclear explosion craters schema 1.png|right|thumb|260px|According to the PAEC, the weapon-testing labs were deeply crafted, L-shaped horizontal tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=PAEC Govt.|title=The Weapon-Testing Laboratories: An illustration by PAEC.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo3WbA8zXZk|publisher=Government of Pakistan release|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A close depiction can be seen in diagram d, e, and f. The tests left a crater as its mark, similar to the illustration above, US copyright.]]

After PAEC officials clearing with Prime minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], the preparations and [[Military logistics|logistics]] matters were given to the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation (1999) and Defence Journal of Pakistan (2000)&quot;/&gt; A secretly coded telegram was sent from the [[Prime Minister's Secretariat (Pakistan)|Prime Minister's Secretariat]] to [[V Corps (Pakistan)|V Corps]] Brigadier Muhammad Sarfraz.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation (1999) and Defence Journal of Pakistan (2000)&quot;/&gt; A helicopter, was arranged for the civilian scientists by Sarfraz.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation (1999) and Defence Journal of Pakistan (2000)&quot;/&gt; In 1977, Sarfraz was dispatched to the [[Military Engineering Service]] to commission [[Military engineering|engineering formations]] of the Pakistan military by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation (1999) and Defence Journal of Pakistan (2000)&quot;/&gt; The PAEC officials readily agreed that the secondary tests would be scientific in nature with the armed forces playing the engineering roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation (1999) and Defence Journal of Pakistan (2000)&quot;/&gt;

The Special Development Works (SDW), assisted by the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], [[Pakistan Army Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering]] (PEME), and [[Frontier Works Organisation]] (FWO), spearheaded the engineering of the potential sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Khan|2012|pp=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military engineers were well aware of satellite detection, therefore the site at Kharan was constructed with extra cautions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rehman|1999|pp=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SDW built around 24 cold test sites, 46 short tunnels, and 35 underground accommodations for troops and command, control and monitoring facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Khan|2012|pp=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test site was {{convert|300|by|200|ft}} and was L-shaped [[Shaft (civil engineering)|horizontal shafts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rehman|1999|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive installations of diagnostic cables, [[motion sensors]], and monitoring stations were established inside the test site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rehman|1999|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took nearly 2–3 years for the SDW to prepare and preparations were completed in 1980, before Pakistan acquired the capability to physically develop an atomic bomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation (1999) and Defence Journal of Pakistan (2000)&quot;/&gt;

After posting at the [[General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)|General Headquarters]], Sarfraz transferred the work to Lieutenant-General [[Zahid Ali Akbar Khan|Zahid Ali Akbar]], the [[Engineer-in-Chief (Pakistan Army)|Engineer-in-Chief]] of the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Printwise Publications&quot;&gt;Rehman, Shahidur, Long Road to Chagai:§The nuclear development under Army: General Zahid Ali, Printwise Publications, Islamabad (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The modernisation of the tests labs were undertaken by the FWO; the FWO uncredited work in the construction of the weapon-testings labs in Kharan Desert, and had supervised the entire construction on the sites along with the SDW.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rehman|1999|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Final preparations were overseen by then-Lieutenant-Colonel [[Zulfikar Ali Khan]] and PAEC chairman [[Munir Ahmad Khan|Munir Ahmad]], assisted by Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]], the [[Chief Technical Officer|Member (Technical)]] of PAEC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Sublette of the nuclear weapon archive&quot;/&gt;

==Test and blast yields==

The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) teams of scientists and engineers arrived at the site led by Dr. [[Samar Mubarakmand]], a [[nuclear physicist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Sublette of the nuclear weapon archive&quot;/&gt; The tests were conducted on 30 May 30, 1998 at 13:10&amp;nbsp;[[Hour|hrs]] (1:10&amp;nbsp;pm) ([[Pakistan Standard Time|PST]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Sublette of the nuclear weapon archive&quot;/&gt; The [[atomic bomb]] was small in size but very efficient and produced a very powerful [[shock wave]] and [[Nuclear weapon yield|blast yield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PakDef, original aired on GEO TV in 2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rehman|1999|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Khan|2012|pp=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The devices were [[boosted fission weapon]]s using [[Weapons-grade#Weapons-grade plutonium|military-grade]] plutonium, yielding 60.1% of the first tests performed two days earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;PakDef, original aired on GEO TV in 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mir|first1=Hamid|title=Interview with Samar Mubarakmand|url=http://pakdef.org/geo-tv-capital-talk-special-interview-with-dr-samar-mubarakmand-n-i-h-i-s-i-chairman-nescom/|website=http://pakdef.org/|publisher=PakDef, original aired on GEO TV in 2005 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) calculated that the blast yield was 20&amp;nbsp;[[kilotonne|kt]] of [[TNT equivalent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Sublette of the nuclear weapon archive&quot;/&gt; Although the [[American Physical Society]] estimated the yield at {{convert|8|ktonTNT}} based on data received by their computer,&lt;ref name=&quot;Binnington Reed&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Binnington Reed|first=Thomas |title=The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation |year=2009 |publisher=Zenith Press |isbn=978-0760335024 |page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pike|2004|pp=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Reed|2009|pp=250–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc. |issn=0096-3402 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAsAAAAAMBAJ |page=24 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] confirmed the TPG blast calculations in an interview in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khan 2012 200–202&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Published in Nuclear weapon archives data&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Khan|first1=Kamran |authorlink1=Kamran Khan (journalist) |title=Interview with Abdul Qadeer Khan |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Pakistan/KhanInterview.html |accessdate=14 June 2015 |work=The News International |agency= |via=nuclearweaponarchive.org |date=30 May 1998 |location=Islamabad |pages=1–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A crater now takes the place of what used to be a small hillock in the rolling desert, marking the ground zero of the nuclear test.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation (1999) and Defence Journal of Pakistan (2000)&quot;/&gt; The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (or PAEC) had tested one or more plutonium nuclear devices, and the results and data of the devices were successful as was expected by the Pakistan's mathematicians and seismologists.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation (1999) and Defence Journal of Pakistan (2000)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
