== Ku Klux Klan members in United States politics ==

Isn't it noteworthy that Harry Truman was also a Klansman for a while: [[Ku Klux Klan members in United States politics]] --[[Special:Contributions/41.151.80.123|41.151.80.123]] ([[User talk:41.151.80.123|talk]]) 20:59, 8 January 2014 (UTC)

== Palestine and Israel ==

I came upon this and I noticed that the section on recognition of Israel seems to be written with bias in.  
As read, it (1) implies Truman unequivocally supported the Zionist position, thus only presenting a partial truth and (2) completely omits his serious needs of financial support in an election cycle to continue to a second term.

The brief description explains support of the arab position as realpolitik hammered by the State Dept purely on the value of oil, and the zionist position as an honorable position bending towards justice (to borrow a phrase from MLK).

For example:
&quot;Truman replied that he would decide his policy on the basis of justice, not oil.&quot; 

The discussion omits much of what Truman thought, especially as he pushed for a bi-national state, with an internationalized Jerusalem, and expected Palestinians to be equals in the resulting political order.  He later expressed strong words condemning the ejection and system depopulation of Palestinians from their lands.  Of course, none of this is here.

The discussion also completely omits zionist support of his campaign to extend his presidency for another 4 years.  

These are all heavy and serious topics that need to be added into this section.  No doubt he thought something should be done, and these need to be explained clearly, as it currently provided a skewed perspective of what this president thought.  I'm not making any changes as of yet, as I'm not a fan of changing sections without opening a forum to host this in, however, the section as-is is incredibly misleading and should be corrected.

-------------------------------
To be sure, Truman had no regrets about Israel after he left office. Israeli Prime Minister Ben Gurion recounted how when, during a meeting in New York in 1961, he praised the former president for his “constant sympathy with our aims in Israel … tears suddenly sprang to his eyes.” But in the years leading up to, and in the months following, American recognition of Israel in May 1948, Truman was filled with doubt and regret about his role. &lt;u&gt;The rosy portrayal of Truman’s unquestioning commitment to and constant sympathy with Israel, which is often linked to a picture of the younger Truman as a Christian Zionist, is dead wrong.&lt;/u&gt;

As president, &lt;b&gt;Truman initially opposed the creation of a Jewish state. Instead, he tried to promote an Arab-Jewish federation or binational state. &lt;/b&gt;He finally gave up in 1947 and endorsed the partition of Palestine into separate states, but &lt;b&gt;he continued to express regret in private that he had not achieved his original objective, which he blamed most often on the “unwarranted interference” of American Zionists.&lt;/b&gt; After he had recognized the new state, he pressed the Israeli government to negotiate with the Arabs over borders and refugees; and &lt;b&gt;expressed his disgust with “the manner in which the Jews are handling the refugee problem.” &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:Harry S. Truman]] → {{no redirect|Harry S Truman}} – His middle name is S. The article does not mention that it stands for something, for a good reason: it stands for nothing other than itself. Therefore to &quot;pretend&quot; to abbreviate it when there is no abbreviation to be had is confusing. Not suggesting we should delete either, but I think we should switch to call the fella by his correct name. In case of doubt, I am not from the United States, so I have no particular bias on this other than correctness. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 14:03, 14 September 2015 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' - see [[Talk:Harry S. Truman#No mention in article of the &quot;S&quot; vs &quot;S.&quot; issue?|the discussion above]] on this very issue. For most cases I would say we should research what standard practice is for Scots with a middle initial rather than a full middle name, but this is a President of the United States. The article (or [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harry_S._Truman&amp;oldid=336427650#Truman.27s_middle_initial an older version of it]) mentions that the [[AP Stylebook|Associated Press Stylebook]] specifically recommends the inclusion of the period for Truman's name specifically, that's a very big indicator for how this article should be titled.

*'''Oppose''' We're a tertiary source.  We may have a MOS, but on substantive matters such as a president's name, we bow to the sources and overwhelmingly, they refer to Truman with an (.) after the S.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 16:25, 14 September 2015 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. Reliable sources use a period, so we do too. '''[[User:Calidum|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: symbol;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0d254c&quot;&gt;Calidum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 17:38, 14 September 2015 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' Per everything that has already been said. Harry used a period, reliable sources use a period, and therefore the article uses a period. [[User:Jojhutton|&lt;font color=&quot;#A81933&quot;&gt;JOJ&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Jojhutton|&lt;font color=&quot;#CC9900&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Hutton&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 00:58, 15 September 2015 (UTC)
*'''Withdrawn'''. I was asked most politely on my talk page to consider withdrawing this nomination by [[User:George Ho]]. by nominator. I can see a [[SNOWBALL]] coming me, but I still feel it is ''wrong'' to list anyone's name wrongly. Redirects are fine to it, but this is just ''wrong'', we list the real name first, nicknames, given names, [[ekename]]s, and so on after.

::This came up via my listing at [[WP:RFD#Harry S Truman]] where it was a procedural close by {{ping|User:BDD}} as that it should be  brought to [[WP:RM]]. So I did. I would have let it lie there (both BDD and I are regulars over at RfD).

::I realise I am going to &quot;lose&quot; this one, but sincerely would thank you all for your considered input and I hope you will accept that I couldn't find all the links you did, it depends on how one searches. I still think it would be only fair on a fellow to give his name as what his [[given name]] was. We don't have [[Harold S Truman]] or [[Harold S. Truman]] for example, as [[misnomers]], but I see this is not a misnomer from the RS given. (Since I sign often just &quot;S.&quot; in real life, like [[Kafka]]'s protagonists were just [[K.]]).

:::'''as an aside'''. Oddly enough, and this is complete coincidence I assure you, on one of the fillers at the start and ends of ad breaks (I forget what those are called) on the UK's [[Yesterday Channel]] or as I tend to call it the Hitler Channel (I was watching something about the [[Siege of Stalingrad]], it was pure coincidence, I had time to kill whereas neither Stalin not Hitler had time enough to) were the words on the caption, and I noted to my surprise that the caption said &quot;The middle name of Harry S. Truman was S&quot;. So perhaps it's kinda right but wrong at the same time: [[WP:NAME]] obviously is [[WP:COMMONNAME]], but this is on the fulcrum, it just seems the wrong way around to me, that we should use the given name and redirect to it.

::Thank you all for your good faith. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew#top|talk]]) 21:26, 18 September 2015 (UTC)

== End of WW II ==

In the introduction, the text states that the Allies concluded WW2 a few weeks after the death of FDR and Truman's ascendancy to the presidency. Clearly, it means the war in Europe not WW2. But I didn't correct the sentence because it seems the author's original intent was to connect the end of the war in Europe to the beginning of the Cold War, given its vital place in Truman's presidency. But this needs to be done without the factual error that WW2 in its entirety ended a few weeks after Truman became president. I'll leave it to someone else (I'm new to editing Wikipedia) to find a way to correct the error without losing the connection of the end of the war in Europe to the beginning of the Cold War.

==Recognizing Israel==
I don't think we should quote his memoirs regarding his motivations for recognizing Israel, because it's all in hindsight, and a better approach would be to describe his attitudes leading up to the recognition.  I think the following paragraph properly summarizes what can be found in reliable sources:
{{cquote|In 1944, then Senator Truman said: &quot;Today, not tomorrow, we must do all that is humanly possible to provide a haven for all those who can be grasped from the hands of Nazi butchers. Free lands must be opened to them.&quot;   But he did not support any and all methods of accomplishing that humanitarian goal, and in particular was initially no fan of Israeli independence, as he explained on November 24, 1945: &quot;I told the Jews that if they were willing to furnish me with five hundred thousand men to carry on a war with the Arabs, we could do what they are suggesting in the Resolution [favoring a state]  - otherwise we we will have to negotiate awhile....What I am trying to do is to make the whole world safe for the Jews. Therefore, I don't feel like going to war for Palestine.&quot;  But he did ultimately support recognition of Israel, due not just to moral considerations, but also for other reasons such as his very difficult reelection battle, his desire that Israel not turn to the Soviet Union for friendship, and the need to alleviate difficulties in Europe without resorting to unpopular increases in immigration to the United States.    All the same, Truman had reservations, and wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt in 1947: &quot;Jews are like all underdogs. When they get on top they are just as intolerant and as cruel as the people were to them when they were underneath.&quot;}}

== His name is Harry S Truman, not Harry S. Truman. ==

His middle name was S, and pretending that S. is correct, based on the idea that if a mistake is pervasive, then the mistake should be considered correct, is a falsehood, and is perpetuating an error. This very article states that his middle name is S and stands for nothing. Reporting facts is to be unbiased, and fact finding is not a democracy. Facts are facts and do not change. The fact is that his name is, in fact, Harry S Truman. This is one of the most taught and remembered facts in American history, and it is time to correct this article. Thank you.
