The '''Fairey Flycatcher''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] single-seat [[biplane]] [[Aircraft carrier|carrier-borne]] [[fighter aircraft]] made by [[Fairey Aviation Company]] which served in the period of 1923 to 1934. It was produced with a conventional undercarriage for [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] use, although this could be interchanged with [[floatplane|floats]] for catapult use aboard [[Battleship|capital ship]]s.

==Design and development==
The Flycatcher was designed to meet the requirements of [[List of Air Ministry Specifications|Specification N6/22]] for a carrier and floatplane fighter to replace the [[Gloster Nightjar]], powered by either the [[Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar]] or the [[Bristol Jupiter]] [[radial engine]]s. Both Fairey and [[Parnall]] submitted designs to meet this specification, with Fairey producing the Flycatcher, and Parnall, the [[Parnall Plover]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor Fairey p113&quot;&gt;Taylor 1974, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of three prototype Flycatchers made its maiden flight on 28 November 1922, powered by a Jaguar II engine,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thetford navy p119&quot;&gt;Thetford 1978, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; although it was later fitted with a Jupiter IV.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor Fairey p114&quot;&gt;Taylor 1974, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Small orders were placed for both the Flycatcher (for nine aircraft) and Plover (for ten aircraft) to allow service evaluation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor Fairey p114-5&quot;&gt;Taylor 1974, pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; After trials, the Flycatcher was ordered for full production.

===Technical description===
The Flycatcher was a remarkable design for its time and was one of the earliest aircraft specifically designed for operation from [[aircraft carriers]].&lt;ref&gt;Crosby 2009, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flap (aircraft)|Flap]]s ran the entire trailing edges of both wings. These could be lowered for landing and takeoff, providing the aircraft with the capability of using only {{convert|50|yd|m|abbr=on}} of deck space &quot;to come and go.&quot;

The [[fuselage]] was made of both wood and metal with fabric covering. A rather cumbersome [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] could be changed for twin floats or a wheel/float combo for amphibian use.

Hydraulic wheel brakes were added to assist the aircraft in stopping in the confined space of an aircraft carrier. [[Tailhook|Arrestor hook]]s on the undercarriage spreader bar were a feature of early models, designed to engage the [[Arresting gear#Components|arrestor wires]] strung out on the carrier deck.

==Operational history==
Production of the Flycatcher began at Fairey's Hayes factory in 1923, entering service with No. 402 Flight [[Fleet Air Arm]]. The Flycatcher was flown from all [[United Kingdom|British]] carriers of its era. Some 192 were produced. A typical deployment was on the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Courageous|50|6}}, where 16 Flycatchers would serve alongside 16 [[Blackburn Ripon]]s and 16 reconnaissance aircraft.

Very popular with pilots, the Flycatchers were easy to fly and very manoeuvrable. It was in these planes that the Fleet Air Arm developed the combat tactics used in the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The Flycatcher saw service with the [[Home Fleet|Home]], [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean]], [[East Indies Station|East Indies]] and [[China Station|China]] fleets.

During its service on the [[China]] station, the Flycatcher was active against Chinese [[pirates]] in the waters near [[Hong Kong]].

;Flycatcher Mk I
: Single-seat fighter aircraft for the Royal Navy.
;Flycatcher Mk II
: Prototype of planned replacement for Flycatcher I. Fundamentally a completely different aircraft from the Flycatcher I, the all-metal Flycatcher II was first flown on 4 October 1926 by [[Norman Macmillan (RAF officer)|Norman Macmillan]], competing against the [[Gloster Gnatsnapper]], [[Hawker Hoopoe]], [[Armstrong Whitworth Starling]] and [[Vickers Type 123|Vickers Type 123/141]] to meet specification N.21/26. Specification later abandoned.  No production.

==Museum exhibits==
[[File:DUXFORD 2.jpg|thumb|right|The replica Flycatcher G-BEYB at the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]] during the 1990s.]]
No aircraft survives, but the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]] holds a replica Flycatcher that was built in 1977. Registered as G-BEYB, it was flown until 1996, when it was put on static display. It is currently held in the museum's reserve collection, to which the public has only occasional access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fleetairarm.com/exhibit/fairey-flycatcher-replica-s1287/6-30-8.aspx &quot;Fairey Flycatcher (replica) (S1287).&quot;] ''Fleet Air Arm Museum.''
