The '''Yermolayev Yer-2''' was a long-range [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[medium bomber]] used during [[World War II]]. It was developed from the [[Bartini Stal-7]] prototype [[airliner]] before the war. It was used to bomb [[Berlin]] from airbases in [[Estonia]] after [[Operation Barbarossa]] in 1941. Production was terminated in August 1941 to allow the factory to concentrate on building higher-priority [[Ilyushin Il-2]] [[ground-attack aircraft]], but was restarted at the end of 1943 with new, fuel-efficient, [[Charomskiy ACh-30]]B [[aircraft Diesel engine]]s.

Although designed as a long-range medium bomber it was flown on tactical ground-attack missions during the [[Battle of Moscow]] with heavy losses. The survivors were flown, in ever dwindling numbers, until August 1943 when the last examples were transferred to schools. However, the resumption of production in 1943 allowed the aircraft to resume combat operations in April 1945. The Yer-2 remained in service with Long-Range Aviation until it was replaced by four-engined bombers such as the [[Tupolev Tu-4]]  at the end of the 1940s.

==Development==
[[Robert Ludvigovich Bartini|Roberto Bartini]] had designed and built the [[Bartini Stal-7|Stal-7]] airliner whilst he was the chief designer at the ZOK NII GVF ({{lang-ru|''Zavod Opytno Konstrooktorskoye Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Institoot Grazhdanskovo Vozdooshnovo Flota''}}&amp;nbsp;— &quot;Factory for Special Construction at the Scientific Test Institute for the Civil Air Fleet&quot;). The performance of the Stal-7 was exceptional, particularly in respect to its payload; at gross overload weight over 56% of the total weight was payload.&lt;ref name=g4&gt;Gordon, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; During flight trials with maximum all-up weight the prototype crashed on takeoff in early 1938, resulting in the arrest of Bartini and his imprisonment in a [[Siberian]] [[Gulag]] in February 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Gunston, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The Stal-7 lay unrepaired until [[Vladimir Yermolaev]] was appointed as chief designer at [[Yermolaev|OKB-240]] after Bartini's arrest, with the task of transforming the Stal-7 design into a long-range bomber, a task made easier since Bartini had reserved space for a bomb bay in the fuselage. After repair the Stal-7 carried on with the flight-test programme, including a record-breaking nonstop flight on 28 August 1939 when it flew [[Moscow]]—[[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]]—[[Sevastopol]]—Moscow; a distance of {{convert|5,086|km|mi|abbr=on}} at an average speed of {{convert|405|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=g4/&gt;

Preliminary design of the DB-240 ({{lang-ru|''dahl'niy bombardirovschik''}}—&quot;long-range bomber&quot;), as the bomber version was designated, was completed by the beginning of 1939 and the construction of two prototypes began the following July. The DB-240 retained little apart from the general layout of the Stal-7 as the structure was almost completely redesigned. The pilot's cockpit was offset to port to improve his downward view and the navigator/bomb aimer sat in the extensively glazed nose with a {{convert|7.62|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[ShKAS]] machine gun, the radio operator sat below and to starboard of the pilot and the dorsal gunner in a partially retractable turret with one {{convert|12.7|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Berezin UB]]T machine gun. Another ShKAS was fitted in a ventral hatch. Up to {{convert|2000|kg|abbr=on|0}} of bombs could be carried in the bomb bay and two {{convert|500|kg|adj=on|0}} bombs could be carried externally. Up to {{convert|4600|kg|abbr=on|0}} of fuel could be carried. The DB-240 had been designed to use the experimental [[Klimov VK-106|Klimov M-106]] [[V12 engine]]s, but the less-powerful [[Klimov M-105]] engine had to be substituted because the M-106 was not available.&lt;ref name=g5&gt;Gordon, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

The DB-240 prototype flew for the first time on 14 May 1940 and began its State acceptance tests on 27 September 1940. The weaker engines prevented the DB-240 from reaching its designed performance.  It could only attain {{convert|445|km/h|abbr=on|0}} at {{convert|4250|m|abbr=on|0}} instead of the expected {{convert|500|km/h|abbr=on|0}} at {{convert|6000|m|sp=us|0}}. Its defensive armament was deemed inadequate and other problems included an excessively long take-off run and engine defects. However, these did not offset its virtues of a heavy bomb load and long-range ({{convert|4100|km|0|sp=us}} carrying {{convert|1000|kg|abbr=on|0}} of bombs). It was ordered into production at Factory No. 18, in [[Voronezh]], as the Yermolayev Yer-2.&lt;ref name=g5/&gt;

Manufacture began in March 1941, with approximately 50 aircraft delivered by 22 June 1941. These aircraft were about {{convert|5|-|8|km/h|abbr=on}} slower than the prototype and their normal weight increased {{convert|1220|kg|abbr=on|0}} to {{convert|12520|kg|abbr=on|0}}. Production was terminated in August, 1941 with only 128 built to allow the factory to concentrate on the higher-priority [[Ilyushin Il-2]] ground-attack aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 355–56&lt;/ref&gt;

A Yer-2 was modified with experimental [[Mikulin AM-37]] engines, a reinforced undercarriage, armored seats for the navigator and gunner, and 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm UBT machine guns in place of its original ShKAS weapons. It first flew in July 1941 and was able to reach {{convert|505|km/h|abbr=on|0}} at {{convert|6000|m|abbr=on|0}}, but the range was reduced to ({{convert|3500|km|abbr=on|0}} carrying {{convert|1000|kg|abbr=on|0}} of bombs. One significant problem with this version was the excessive takeoff roll which hindered operations from grass airstrips.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was unreliable, however, and had cooling problems that the Mikulin [[OKB]] did not have the resources to resolve so it was cancelled in October when the factory was forced to evacuate from Moscow by the German advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kotelnikov|first=Vladimir|title=Russian Piston Aero Engines|publisher=Crowood Press|location=Marlborough, Wiltshire|date=2005|page=110|isbn=1-86126-702-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Charomskiy M-40]]F Diesel engine was also evaluated in a Yer-2 in 1941. This engine, like all Diesels, offered a greatly reduced [[Brake specific fuel consumption|fuel consumption]] compared to a standard gasoline-powered engine, but at a great penalty in weight. These engines increased the gross takeoff weight to {{convert|13500|kg|abbr=on|0}} which required the undercarriage to be reinforced and the wing area increased to keep the same [[wing loading]]. The M-40F-powered aircraft reached a maximum speed of {{convert|430|km/h|abbr=on|0}} at {{convert|6050|m|abbr=on|0}}. However, the M-40 was not yet ready for service use and the project was cancelled.&lt;ref name=g8&gt;Gordon, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft/engine combination did have enough potential that development work continued using the closely related, but more mature, [[Charomskiy ACh-30]]B Diesel engine. The cockpit was modified to accommodate two pilots side-by-side and the wing and tailplane areas were increased. The 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm UBT machine gun in the dorsal turret was replaced by a {{convert|20|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[ShVAK cannon]] and the nose and ventral ShKAS machine guns were exchanged for 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm UBT machine guns. Up to {{convert|5460|kg|abbr=on|0}} of fuel could be carried. The Yer-2/ACh-30B was placed into production at Factory No. 39 in [[Irkutsk]] at the end of 1943 and the first production aircraft was submitted to its State acceptance trials the following month. Some excess aircraft were converted as Yer-2ON VIP transports.&lt;ref name=g8/&gt;

==Operational history==
The Yer-2 was not in squadron service when Germany invaded on 22 June 1941, but the 420th and 421st Long-Range Bomber Regiments ({{lang-ru|Dahl'niy Bombardirovchnyy Aviapolk}}—DBAP) were formed shortly afterwards. However neither regiment flew any operational missions until later in the summer.&lt;ref name=g5/&gt; On the evening of 10 August Yer-2s of the 420th DBAP, accompanied by [[Petlyakov Pe-8]]s of the 432nd DBAP, attempted to bomb Berlin from Pushkino Airfield near [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. The airfield was too short to accommodate a fully loaded Yer-2, but three bombers did manage to take off regardless. Two managed to bomb Berlin, or its outskirts, but only one successfully returned; the other was shot down by 'friendly' [[Polikarpov I-16]]s when it reentered Soviet airspace and the third aircraft went missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geroi.apifarm.ru/doc/first/34/1|script-title=ru:Водопьянов Михаил Васильевич|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three crews from the 420th DBAP bombed [[Königsberg]] during the nights of 28–29 August and 30 August–1 September from [[Ramenskoye Airport]], southeast of [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;420BAP&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://allaces.ru/cgi-bin/s2.cgi/sssr/struct/p/bap420.dat|title=420-й дальнебомбардировочный авиационный полк ОН|date=29 November 2009|publisher=Allaces.ru|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1941 63 Yer-2s were in service, but only 34 were operational.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADD&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ilpilot.narod.ru/vvs_tsifra/gl_3/3.118.html|script-title=ru:Качественный состав боевых самолетов Дальней авиации на важнейшие даты Великой Отечественной войны 1941–1945 гг.|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 420th DBAP had flown 154 [[sortie]]s by the beginning of November (6 in August, 81 in September, 67 in October) and had lost 30 of its 40 aircraft. Over half of these (19) were due to non-combat losses. Losses were extremely high over the autumn and winter as they were inappropriately committed against German tactical frontline targets during the [[Battle of Moscow]] at low altitudes and only 12 were in service on 18 March 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADD&quot;/&gt; On 4 August 1942 the 747th DBAP had only ten Yer-2s on hand and it was briefly committed during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].&lt;ref name=747BAP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://allaces.ru/cgi-bin/s2.cgi/sssr/struct/p/bap421.dat|title=421-й дальнебомбардировочный авиационный полк 747-й авиационный полк дальнего действия|date=8 October 2007|publisher=Allaces.ru|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors were flown, in ever dwindling numbers, until August 1943 when the last few aircraft were transferred to schools by the 2nd Guards DBAP and the 747th DBAP.&lt;ref name=747BAP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://allaces.ru/cgi-bin/s2.cgi/sssr/struct/p/apdd748.dat|title=748-й дальнебомбардировочный авиационный полк 748-й авиационный полк дальнего действия 2-й гвардейский Смоленский Краснознаменный авиационный полк дальнего действия 2-й гвардейский бомбардировочный Смоленско-Будапештский дважды Краснознаменный авиационный полк|date=29 November 2009|publisher=Allaces.ru|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yer-2 was placed back into production at the end of 1943, but none of the new bombers had been issued to combat units by 1 June 1944. However 42 were in service on 1 January 1945 and 101 on 10 May 1945 after the war ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADD&quot;/&gt; The first combat mission undertaken by Yer-2s after they returned to production was a raid on [[Königsberg]] on 7 April 1945 by the 327th and 329th Bomber Aviation Regiments ({{lang-ru|Bombardirovchnyy Aviatsionyy Polk}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bergstrom|first=Christer|title=Bagration to Berlin—The Final Air Battles in the East: 1944–1945|publisher=Classic Publications|location=Hersham, Surrey|date=2008|page=108|isbn=978-1-903223-91-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained in service with Long-Range Aviation units until replaced by four-engined bombers like the [[Tupolev Tu-4]] in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name=g8/&gt;
