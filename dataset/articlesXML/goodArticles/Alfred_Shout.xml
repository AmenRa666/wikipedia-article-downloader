'''Alfred John Shout''', [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (8 August 1882&amp;nbsp;– 11 August 1915) was a New Zealand-born soldier and an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. Shout was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions at [[Battle of Lone Pine|Lone Pine]] in August 1915, during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. After the Turks had counterattacked and seized a large stretch of the Australians' front line, Shout gathered a small party of men and charged down one trench throwing bombs. He killed eight Turks, and managed to clear others to retake the trench. In a similar action later that day, and supported by another officer, he recaptured further ground amid hard fighting. In the final push forward, Shout simultaneously lit three bombs to lob at the Turks. He successfully threw two, but the third burst just as it was leaving his hand. Shout was grievously wounded, and died three days later.

Born in [[Wellington]], Shout had served in the [[Second Boer War]] as a teenager. He rose to [[sergeant]] and was [[mentioned in despatches]] for saving a wounded man before he was discharged in 1902. He remained in South Africa for the next five years, serving as an artilleryman in the [[Cape Colonial Forces]] from 1903. With his Australian-born wife and their daughter, Shout emigrated to [[Sydney]] in 1907. The family settled in [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]], where Shout worked for [[Resch's]] Brewery as a [[Carpentry|carpenter]] and [[joiner]]. He was also active in the [[Citizens Military Force|Militia]], being [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] just prior to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In August 1914, he enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] for active service and was appointed a [[lieutenant]] in the [[1st Battalion (Australia)|1st Battalion]]. After a period of training in Egypt, he took part in the [[Landing at Anzac Cove|Anzac landings at Gallipoli]] on 25 April 1915. For his leadership during the invasion and its immediate aftermath, Shout was awarded the [[Military Cross]] and later mentioned in despatches. Shout's three gallantry awards at Gallipoli made him the most highly decorated member of the AIF for the campaign.

Alfred John Shout was born in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, on 8 August 1882.{{#tag:ref|There is discrepancy between sources regarding Shout's date of birth. {{Harvnb|Higgins|1988|}}, in Shout's ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' entry, states it to be 7 August 1881. {{Harvnb|Staunton|2005|p=37}} also gives 7 August, though records the year to have been 1882. Shout's Australian Imperial Force service file, however, notes it to be 8 August 1882, which is the date given in {{Harvnb|Arthur|2005|p=677}}, {{Harvnb|Bean|1941a|p=295}}, {{Harvnb|Snelling|1995|p=178}} and {{Harvnb|Wigmore|1963|p=47}}.

At one point during the engagement, he ventured out under heavy rifle fire to retrieve a wounded man, and brought him back to a place of safety. As a result of his &quot;great courage&quot; in this action, Shout was [[mentioned in despatches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs178&quot;/&gt; He was promoted to [[sergeant]] on 7 May 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27311|date=7 May 1901|startpage=3114|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discharged from the Border Horse 16 days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boer&quot;/&gt; He then joined the Stellenbosch District Mounted Troop and,&lt;ref name=&quot;Queen's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendant&quot;/&gt; having &quot;served with distinction&quot; during his time in South Africa, left the service in 1902.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;

Shout decided to remain in South Africa after his discharge and, in 1903, enlisted in the [[Cape Colonial Forces]]. He was made a sergeant in [[Cape Field Artillery|Prince Alfred's Own Cape Field Artillery]], with which he served until 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs178&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendant&quot;/&gt; While living in [[Cape Town]], Shout married Rose Alice Howe, an Australian from [[Sydney]], in 1905; the couple had a daughter named Florence Agnes Maud on 11 June that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cenotaph&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Queen's&quot;/&gt; In 1907, the Shout family emigrated to Australia, settling in the Sydney suburb of [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]]. Here, Shout gained employment as a [[Carpentry|carpenter]] and [[joiner]] at [[Resch's]] Brewery.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs178&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendant&quot;/&gt; Though his keen interest in the military remained, and he joined the 29th Infantry Regiment of the part-time [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Military Force]] (CMF) shortly after arriving in Sydney. He was also a regular visitor of the [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]] rifle range, where he gained a reputation as an excellent shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs178&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wigmore&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wigmore|1963|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendant&quot;/&gt; A foundation member of the 29th Infantry Club, Shout was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in the CMF on 16 June 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs178&quot;/&gt;

Following the outbreak of the First World War, Shout enlisted in the recently raised [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) on 27 August 1914 for service overseas. He was posted to the [[1st Battalion (Australia)|1st Battalion]] as a second lieutenant in F Company, commanded by Lieutenant Cecil Sasse.

As part of an endeavour to defeat the [[Ottoman Empire]] and force a supply route through to Russia via the [[Bosporus]] and the [[Black Sea]], the British War Council formulated an invasion plan of the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com.rp.nla.gov.au/view/10.1093/acref/9780195517842.001.0001/acref-9780195517842-e-497|title=Gallipoli|accessdate=29 June 2013|last1=Dennis|first1=Peter|last2=Grey|first2=Jeffrey|author-link2=Jeffrey Grey|last3=Morris|first3=Ewan|last4=Prior|first4=Robinand|last5=Bou|first5=Jean|work=The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History|publisher=Oxford Reference Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arthur|2005|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April 1915, the men of the [[1st Brigade (Australia)|1st Australian Brigade]]—of which the 1st Battalion was part—[[Landing at Anzac Cove|landed ashore at Anzac Cove]] between 05:30 and 07:30 among the second and third waves of Australian troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bean|1941a|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st Battalion was meant to be held in reserve, but was soon forced into battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlyon141&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlyon|2002|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallipoli&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anzacsite.gov.au/5environment/vc/shout.html|title=Captain Alfred Shout|accessdate=21 December 2009|work=Gallipoli and the Anzacs|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a request for reinforcements, Shout moved up with one of the 1st Battalion's companies to the hill feature &quot;Baby 700&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlyon141&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean296&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bean|1941a|pp=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving at the position around 11:00,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean296&quot;/&gt; he led a party of men to hold the rear left flank of the hill as part of the Australians' rearguard action.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs178&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bean|1941a|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied position on Baby 700 had become dire by that afternoon, which was compounded by the small number of available infantry in the area and the complete lack of artillery support, when the Turks launched a counter-assault. By this time, Shout and Lieutenant [[Leslie Morshead]] of the [[2nd Battalion (Australia)|2nd Battalion]] were the only two surviving officers in their sector of the line. At 16:30, the Turks broke through the defensive line and the Australians were forced to abandon their position on Baby 700. Shout was one of the last to evacuate, and withdrew down towards the beach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendant&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bean|1941a|pp=314–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his retreat, Shout encountered Lieutenant Colonel [[George Braund]], commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, on Walker's Ridge. Braund dispatched Shout to the beach with a request for reinforcements. Shout duly relayed the message, and was immediately tasked with leading 200 stray men to reinforce the thin defensive line near Braund's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bean|1941a|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlyon|2002|pp=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shout established a post at the base of the ridge as dusk began to set in, and his men started to dig in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bean|1941a|p=471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=...&amp;nbsp;Lieutenant Shout was a hero. Wounded himself several times, he kept picking up wounded men and carrying them out of the firing line. I saw him carry fully a dozen men away. Then another bullet struck him in the arm, and it fell useless by his side. Still he would not go to the rear. &quot;I am here with you boys to the finish&quot;, was the only reply he would make&amp;nbsp;... A little later Lieutenant Shout was wounded again, and fell down. It was cruel to see him. He struggled and struggled until he got to his feet, refusing all entreaties to go to the rear. Then he staggered and fell and tried to rise again. At last some men seized him and carried him away, still protesting.

By 27 April, Shout had been continually in action without rest since the landing. That morning, he was sent to Walter's Ridge to replace a wounded officer in a vulnerable sector of the line.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs178&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bean|1941a|pp=508–509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shout and his men were subjected to accurate and heavy rifle fire throughout the day, as the Turks shot from the scrub just beyond the Australians' trench. To combat this, he reorganised his men and, exposing himself to the Turks' fire, ventured out to reconnoitre the enemy's position in order to accurately direct his men's rifle fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1068827--20-.pdf|title=Recommendation for Alfred John Shout to be awarded the Military Cross|accessdate=8 October 2016|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though wounded early in the action, Shout refused to leave the frontline.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs178&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallipoli&quot;/&gt; As the fighting wore on, the Turks closed in on the Australian trench and Shout led a bayonet charge to hold them at bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt; He was later wounded a second time, with a bullet passing through his arm and rendering it useless, but still he refused to leave. Soon after, he was wounded a third time and evacuated for medical treatment. Throughout the engagement, Shout had carried several wounded men out of the frontline.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs178&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallipoli&quot;/&gt; Cited for his &quot;conspicuous courage and ability&quot; at Walker's Ridge, Shout was awarded the [[Military Cross]];&lt;ref name=&quot;MCGaz&quot;/&gt; the first member of his battalion to be so honoured.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs161&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Snelling|1995|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notification and accompanying citation for the medal was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 3 July 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCGaz&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29215|date=3 July 1915|startpage=6541|supp=yes|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shout's wounds proved not to be serious and he soon rejoined the 1st Battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs178&quot;/&gt; On 11 May, he was injured once again, suffering another bullet wound to his arm. He was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS ''Gascon'' but, having sufficiently recovered, rejoined his unit fifteen days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; On 20 May, Shout was [[Mentioned in Despatches|mentioned in the despatch]] of General [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Sir Ian Hamilton]], the General Officer Commanding [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]], in recognition of his efforts from the landing on 25 April up to 5 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29251|date=5 August 1915|startpage=7668|supp=yes|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 29 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;

An artillery barrage had preceded the attack, though according to historian Robin Prior the results had been &quot;feeble&quot; and the advance was hard fought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prior|2010|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, within half an hour the Australians had breached the Turkish trenches and seized their objectives.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs147&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AFPine&quot;/&gt; Despite the initial success, the Australian casualties had been heavy and the 1st Battalion was ordered forward in preparation for the expected Turkish counter-attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valour&quot;/&gt; The battle descended into &quot;bitter, savage fighting&quot; over the next three days,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; predominantly in the form of &quot;deadly bombing duels&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valour&quot;/&gt;

At 09:00 on 9 August, the 1st Battalion relieved the 3rd Battalion on the Lone Pine front at a position known as Sasse's Sap. Soon after, the Turks renewed their attack and recaptured a stretch of the sap.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean564&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bean|1941b|pp=564–565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determined to rout these men, and supported by a small number of his own soldiers, Shout charged down one trench throwing bombs. He killed eight Turks, and managed to clear others to retake the trench.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, Captain Cecil Sasse—Shout's former company commander—gathered three men with sandbags, and cleared another {{convert|20|yd|m}} section of the sap.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs163&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Snelling|1995|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armed with a rifle, Sasse charged down the trench at the front of his men. They discovered a group of Turks focused on, and firing in, a different direction; Sasse's party killed 12 and forced the remainder to flee. Sasse then continued to keep the Turks at bay with rifle fire as his men barricaded the trench with the sandbags.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean564&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Infantry Battalion War Diary|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/bundled/RCDIG1008889.pdf|work=Australian Imperial Force unit war diaries, 1914–18 War|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|There appears to be some confusion regarding Shout's and Sasse's actions on the morning of 9 August. Some sources connect the two actions, to say that Shout and Sasse operated in unison to clear a trench in the morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs163&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrett198&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Perrett|2004|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, official historian [[Charles Bean]] and other more recent scholarship indicates that the two actions were separate. As Shout and Sasse did work together in the afternoon, it is possible that the actions have become confused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean564&quot;/&gt;|group=Note}}

Sasse, described by official historian [[Charles Bean]] as &quot;elated&quot; by the achievement that morning, approached Shout with a proposal to repeat the feat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean564&quot;/&gt; Shout agreed. The duo assembled a party of eight men this time to carry sandbags and extra bombs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallipoli&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs163&quot;/&gt; Having reconnoitred the Turks' position, the previously erected barricade was shoved down and, side-by-side, Sasse and Shout ran forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean564&quot;/&gt; While Sasse fired his revolver and Shout lobbed bombs, the Australian party advanced in short stages along the trench and built a barricade each time they halted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt; Shout was fighting with &quot;splendid gaiety&quot; throughout the assault,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean564&quot;/&gt; &quot;laughing and joking and cheering his men on&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs163&quot;/&gt; As the Australians progressed further, the two officers located a suitable position to raise their final barricade. Readying himself for this final push forward, Shout simultaneously lit three bombs. He successfully threw two, but the third burst just as it was leaving his hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean564&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrett198&quot;/&gt; Shout was grievously wounded. The explosion incinerated his right hand and part of the left, destroyed his left eye, cut his cheek, and caused burns to his chest and leg.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs163&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VC&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29328|date=15 October 1915|startpage=10153|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the severity of his injuries, Shout maintained consciousness and was dragged out of the firing line, where he remained cheerful, &quot;drank tea and sent a message to his wife&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean564&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs163&quot;/&gt;

The announcement of Shout's VC was promulgated in the ''London Gazette'' on 15 October 1915, reading:&lt;ref name=&quot;VC&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|''War Office, 15th&amp;nbsp;October, 1915.''

His Majesty The KING has been pleased to award the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and Men: —

Captain Alfred John Shout, 1st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force.

For most conspicuous bravery at Lone Pine trenches, in the Gallipoli Peninsula.

On the morning of the 9th&amp;nbsp;August, 1915, with a very small party Captain Shout charged down trenches strongly occupied by the enemy, and personally threw four bombs among them, killing eight and routing the remainder.

In the afternoon of the same day, from the position gained in the morning, he captured a further length of trench under similar conditions, and continued personally to bomb the enemy at close range under very heavy fire until he was severely wounded, losing his right hand and left eye.

This most gallant officer has since succumbed to his injuries.}}

Considerable confusion reigned following Shout's death. Army Headquarters in [[Melbourne]] cabled Rose Shout on 15 August to inform her that Alfred had been wounded. Confirmation of his death was subsequently conveyed to her, but was contradicted by a later cable on 23 August. This communication stated that Shout was not dead, but alive and was returning to Australia aboard the ''Thermistocles''. The press in Australia published news of his pending return, adding that he would arrive in Sydney in mid-September. This proved to be a case of mistaken identity. Shout's death was confirmed by 26 August; a Lieutenant A.J. Shirt, also of the 1st Battalion, was the officer aboard the ''Thermistocles''. Rose Shout received a ministerial apology for the clerical errors and distress caused.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs163&quot;/&gt;

Shout is commemorated on the [[Lone Pine Memorial]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/719048/SHOUT,%20ALFRED%20JOHN|title=Shout, Alfred John|work=Casualty Details|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was remembered by the citizens of Darlington with a memorial plaque. The [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]], [[Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar|Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson]], unveiled the plaque at the Darlington Town Hall in a ceremony on 20 November 1915. The plaque has since entered the collections of the [[Victoria Barracks, Sydney|Victoria Barracks Museum]] in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs163&quot;/&gt; In 1916, to honour &quot;the heroic and glorious deeds and death&quot; of Shout and relieve the financial strain placed upon his wife, a collection was taken up by local citizens in Sydney to provide Rose and their daughter with a house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=19 September 1916|title=Case of Mrs. Shout|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/15682052?searchTerm=Mrs%20Shout&amp;searchLimits=|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephens|first=A.G.|date=27 September 1916|title=Captain A.

Until 2006 Shout's medals were in the possession of his family. However, that year Shout's grandson decided to sell the medals to relieve some of the family debt and financial burdens. At the time Shout's VC was the only one to the AIF at Gallipoli not in the collection of the [[Australian War Memorial]]. The medals were auctioned by the Sydney firm Bonhams &amp; Goodman on 24 July 2006, and realised a world record hammer price of [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1 million. The sale surpassed, almost doubling, the previous auction records for a medal—set by the [[Naval Gold Medal]] awarded to [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet]]—and the price paid for a VC, 
previously held by that awarded to [[Norman Cyril Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 July 2006|title=Gallipoli VC Medal Sets Auction Record|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Gallipoli-VC-medal-sets-auction-record/2006/07/24/1153593264537.html|newspaper=[[The Age]]|access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shout's medals were purchased by media mogul [[Kerry Stokes]], who subsequently donated the set to the Australian War Memorial for display in the Hall of Valour.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria Cross|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/vic_cross/|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
