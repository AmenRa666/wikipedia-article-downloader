The term '''&quot;Fucking New Guy&quot; (FNG)''' is a [[term of disparagement|derogatory term]], made popular within [[combatant]]s, [[military chaplain]]s, and [[combat medic]]s of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] deployed to South East Asia during the [[Vietnam War]], usually to refer to newcomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Cornell  | first1 = George | title = G.I. Slang in Vietnam  | journal =  The Journal of American Culture  | volume = 4  | issue = 2  | pages = 195–200 | publisher = [[Blackwell Publishing]]  | location = Oxford  | date = [[Summer]] | year = 1981  | doi = 10.1111/j.1542-734X.1981.0402_195.x  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnam War overview==
Usually, but not always, the term referred to recruits fresh from the [[United States]] who joined pre-existing units in [[Vietnam]]. Every unit had a FNG, and the term was used across all unit types, from front line combat through to support and medical units. The term was not gender specific; female personnel could be FNGs as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author = Sexton, Julia A.  | title = Warrior Women of the Crimea and Vietnam: A Comparison of Fact and Fiction | version = Final | publisher = Unpublished | date = May 2002 | url = http://www.illyria.com/documents/julia_chap5.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2008-04-06 }}  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016132254/http://www.illyria.com/documents/julia_chap5.pdf |date=October 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FNG phenomenon grew out of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]]'s individual rotation policy during the Vietnam War, under which individual troops were rotated in and out in twelve-month tours with already deployed units in Vietnam. In other modern American wars before and since, military units have been maintained and have deployed as a whole.  During this period, because of the [[Cold War]], the United States faced the need of maintaining a large presence of troops not only in Southeast Asia, but in [[South Korea]] and [[Western Europe]] as well.  The [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] administration lacked the political capital and will that would have been required to call up the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] and [[Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States|Reserves]] or to convince [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] to extend the tours of duty of draftees beyond twenty-four months. Lacking sufficient ground combat units to sustain a unit-based rotation strategy, the individual rotation policy was adopted.&lt;ref name=hn&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Mark DePu | title = Vietnam War: The Individual Rotation Policy | publisher = HistoryNet | url = http://www.historynet.com/vietnam-war-the-individual-rotation-policy.htm | accessdate = 2008-11-19 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FNGs were an important part of the [[Group dynamics|group dynamic]] of U.S. units in Vietnam and their treatment had at its core an overall sense of  &quot;us&quot; (those with experience of the war) and &quot;them&quot; (those who were back in the United States). As one soldier said, FNGs were ''&quot;still shitting stateside chow&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last1 = Mathers | first1 = Danny L., Rifleman, B Company, 1/61 | title = New Guys | url = http://one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com/161pg14a.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-06 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in combat units that the FNG was truly ignored and hated by his colleagues. An FNG in a combat unit was ''&quot;treated as a non-person, a pariah to be shunned and scorned, almost vilified, until he passed that magic, unseen line to respectability&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAM&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |editor=Tim Page |editor2=John Pimlott |title=NAM: The Vietnam Experience 1965-1975 |chapter=FNG's |publisher=Hamlyn |year=1988 |pages=441–443 |isbn=0-600-56311-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the surface, such treatment of new members in the unit happened for simple survival reasons. New recruits had a higher [[Attrition warfare|attrition]] rate than experienced troops, and the small units of veteran [[jungle warfare]] troops simply saw them as a liability. ''&quot;They talked too loud and made too much noise while moving around, didn't know what to take into the bush or even how to wear it properly, couldn't respond to basic combat commands, fired too much ammo, and tended to flake out on even the easiest 10-[[Klick (kilometer)|klick]] moves. An' Christ, they even got homesick.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;NAM&quot;/&gt;

Beyond mere survival though, there were deeper reasons for veterans to hate the newcomers. On one level, the FNG represented those men who were still in America and this fomented resentment. As one popular [[Military cadence|marching song]] of the era went: ''Ain't no use in lookin' back, Jody's got your [[Cadillac]]; Ain't no use in going home, Jody's got your girl and gone''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAM&quot;/&gt; Until they set foot in Vietnam, every FNG was a &quot;[[Military cadence#.22Jody calls.22|Jody]]&quot;, back in the U.S. enjoying life.

Within a combat unit, the FNG was seen as a grunt. A unit would attach an almost mystical quality to any members of the unit with prior combat experience; the FNG was expected to live up to the same standard and would not be accepted into the group until he too had made a name for himself.

The term is still used today in law enforcement, the United States military, Wildland Firefighters (esp. Hotshots), the Canadian Military, and technical trades heavily populated with ex-military.

==Studies==
Several specific studies have been undertaken into the FNG phenomenon. Prominent military psychiatrists warned that the individual replacement system was having catastrophic consequences on [[unit cohesion]].&lt;ref name=hn /&gt;

* Dr. [[Douglas R. Bey]] published &quot;Group dynamics and the &quot;F.N.G.&quot; in Vietnam—a potential focus of stress&quot; in 1972 and has been referenced extensively, including having been used in defense of [[Military initiation|initiation practices]] within modern U.S. combat units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bey | first1 = Douglas R.  | title = Group dynamics and the &quot;F.N.G.&quot; in Vietnam--a potential focus of stress  | journal = International Journal of Group Psychotherapy  | volume = 22 | issue = 1  | pages = 22–50  | publisher = Guilford Press  | location = New York  | date = January 1972  | pmid = 5057967 | issn = 0343-6993  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dr. [[Charles Figley]] has also written on the effects of being an FNG as part of the development of [[post traumatic stress disorder]] in combat veterans.

==Media and entertainment==
The term FNG and the group dynamics associated with it have been addressed on some level in several major motion pictures in the last couple of decades and is still used in the US military.

* [[Oliver Stone]]'s film ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' traces the experiences of young recruit Private Chris Taylor ([[Charlie sheen|Charlie Sheen]]) during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video  | people = Stone, Oliver (Director)  | title = [[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]  | medium = Theatrical Release  | publisher = [[Arnold Kopelson|Kopelson, Arnold (Producer)]]  | location = USA  |date = 1986 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Robert Zemeckis]]'s film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', the titular character ([[Tom Hanks]]) and his best friend Bubba ([[Mykelti Williamson]]) are called FNGs by their commanding officer Lt Dan Taylor ([[Gary Sinise]]) when they first arrive in Vietnam.
* The backpacker novel ''[[The Beach (novel)|The Beach]]'' by [[Alex Garland]], later made into a [[The Beach (film)|film]] of the same title and directed by [[Danny Boyle]], introduced the term into popular culture amongst young tourists in South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Garland  | first = Alex  | authorlink = Alex Garland  | title = The Beach  | publisher = [[Viking Press]]  | location = London  | year = 1996  | isbn = 0-670-87014-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Danny Boyle|Boyle, Danny (director)]]|title=[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]|url= |format= |medium=Theatrical Release|publisher=[[Andrew Macdonald (producer)|Macdonald, Andrew (Producer)]]|location=United States|accessdate=2008-07-21 |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Donald Bodey]] has written a fictional account of the FNG experience in his novel titled simply ''FNG''.&lt;ref&gt;
