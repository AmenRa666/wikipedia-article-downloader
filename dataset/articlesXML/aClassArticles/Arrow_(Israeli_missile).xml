The '''Arrow''' or '''''Hetz''''' ({{lang-he-n |חֵץ}}, {{IPA-he|ˈχet͡s|pron}}) is a family of [[anti-ballistic missile]]s designed to fulfill an Israeli requirement for a [[missile defense|theater missile defense system]] that would be more effective against [[ballistic missile]]s than the [[MIM-104 Patriot]] [[surface-to-air missile]]. Jointly funded and produced by Israel and the United States, development of the system began in 1986 and has continued since, drawing some contested criticism. Undertaken by [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] (IAI) and [[Boeing]], it is overseen by the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Defense]]'s &quot;''Homa''{{-&quot;}} ({{lang-he|חומה}}, {{IPA-he |χoma|pron}}, &quot;[[Defensive wall|rampart]]&quot;) administration and the U.S. [[Missile Defense Agency]].

The Arrow system consists of the joint production [[hypersonic]] Arrow anti-missile interceptor, the [[Elta]] [[EL/M-2080 Green Pine|EL/M-2080]] &quot;Green Pine&quot; [[Early warning radar|early-warning]] [[Active Electronically Scanned Array|AESA]] [[radar]], the [[Elisra]] &quot;Golden Citron&quot; (&quot;Citron Tree&quot;) [[C4ISTAR|C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;I]] center, and the [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] &quot;Brown Hazelnut&quot; (&quot;Hazelnut Tree&quot;) launch control center. The system is transportable, as it can be moved to other prepared sites.

Following the construction and testing of the Arrow 1 technology demonstrator, production and deployment began with the Arrow 2 version of the missile.  The Arrow is considered one of the most advanced missile defense programs currently in existence.&lt;ref name = mstrt&gt;{{cite web |url= http://missilethreat.com/missiledefensesystems/id.10/system_detail.asp |publisher= [[Claremont Institute]] | work = Missile Threat | title = Missile defense systems: Arrow |accessdate = 2009-08-19 }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;jewish&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/Arrow.html | publisher = [[Jewish Virtual Library]] | title = The Arrow missile program | accessdate = 2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the first operational missile defense system specifically designed and built to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles.&lt;ref name=nti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Israel/Missile/ |publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] |title=Israel profile: missile overview: Arrow anti-ballistic missile defense system |date=October 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-19 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = aipac&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.aipac.org/~/media/Publications/Policy%20and%20Politics/AIPAC%20Analyses/Issue%20Memos/2006/12/U_S_Israel_Missile_Defense_Cooperation.pdf | format = PDF |publisher= [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] |title = U.S.–Israel missile defense cooperation | date = 2006-12-21 | accessdate = 2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Arrow battery was declared fully operational in October 2000. Although several of its components have been exported, the [[Israeli Air Defense Command]] within the [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) is currently the sole user of the complete Arrow system.

==Background==
{{See also|Arab–Israeli conflict}}
The Arrow program was launched in light of the acquisition by [[Arab League|Arab states]] of long ranged [[surface-to-surface missile]]s.&lt;ref name=iafkg&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Israeli Air Force]] | title= Israel Aircraft Industries 'Arrow' ('Hetz') | url = http://www.iaf.org.il/907-18137-EN/IAF.aspx | accessdate = 2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dtic /&gt; It was chosen over [[Rafael Advanced Defense Systems|RAFAEL Armament Development Authority]]'s AB-10 missile defense system since the Arrow was judged to be a more complete concept and have greater range.  The AB-10 system was criticized as being merely an improved [[MIM-23 Hawk]], rather than a system designed from the outset for missile interception.&lt;ref name=nti0&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/db/missile/1998/m9808247.htm |publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] |title=The big arrow In Israel's quiver |date=1998-10-05 |accessdate=2011-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727133602/http://www.nti.org/db/missile/1998/m9808247.htm |archivedate=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and Israel signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] to co-fund the Arrow program on May 6, 1986,&lt;ref name=&quot;global&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.policyalmanac.org/world/archive/crs_israeli-us_relations.shtml |last=Clyde |first= Mark R. | work = Almanac of Policy Issues |title=Israeli–United States relations |date= 2002-10-17 | accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1988 the [[United States Department of Defense]] [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative Organization]] (SDIO) placed an order with Israel Aircraft Industries for the Arrow 1 technology demonstrator.&lt;ref name=&quot;armytec&quot;&gt;{{cite web | work = Army technology | title = Arrow 2 theater ballistic missile defense system, Israel | url = http://www.army-technology.com/projects/arrow2/ | accessdate= 2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=global/&gt;&lt;ref name=tests/&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Over the years SDIO was renamed to [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization]] (BMDO), and later to Missile Defense Agency (MDA), while Israel Aircraft Industries was renamed to [[Israel Aerospace Industries]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gulf War]], which exposed the controversial performance&lt;ref name= &quot;fas_patriot&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1992_h/ | title = The performance of the Patriot missile in the Gulf| author1-link= Theodore Postol |first1= Theodore | last1 = Postol | first2= Reuven |last2= Pedatzur | first3 = Charles |last3 = Zraket |author4-link = Peter Zimmerman |first4= Peter |last4= Zimmerman | publisher = [[Federation of American Scientists]]| date = 1992-04-07 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}. Retrieved 2009-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot missile]] against [[Iraq]]i &quot;[[Al Hussein (missile)|Al Hussein]]&quot; missiles, gave further impetus to the development of the Arrow.&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt; It was initially designed to intercept missiles such as the [[Scud|SS-1 &quot;Scud&quot;]], its &quot;Al Hussein&quot; derivative, the [[OTR-21 Tochka|SS-21 &quot;Scarab&quot;]] operated by [[Syria]], and the [[Dongfeng (missile)#Dongfeng 3 (CSS-2)|CSS-2]] operated by [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=dtic /&gt; The Arrow evolved also with an eye on the advanced missile programs of [[Iran]]. [[Yitzhak Rabin]], then [[Yitzhak Rabin#Opposition Knesset member and Minister of Defense|Defense Minister of Israel]], viewed the emerging missile threat as one of the most dangerous future threats on Israel's security.&lt;ref name=&quot;inss&quot; /&gt; He said of the program that:
{{cquote|I had the honor, during my term of office as Minister of Defense, in the [[National Unity Government#Israel|National Unity Government]], to vote in favor of Israel's participation in the Strategic Defense Initiative... introduced by [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]]...&lt;ref name=&quot;tests&quot; /&gt;}}
The Israeli [[Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure]], part of the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Defense]], runs the Arrow development project under the ''&quot;Homa&quot;'' administration. The ''&quot;Homa&quot;'' administration, which is also commonly referred to as the IMDO – Israel Missile Defense Organization, is responsible for coordinating industrial activities of Israel's different defense companies involved in the development of the Arrow system.&lt;ref name=&quot;tests&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;haalong&quot;/&gt;

===Funding===
{{See also|Israel – United States military relations}}
The multibillion-dollar development program of the Arrow is undertaken in Israel with the financial support of the United States. When the development program began, the projection for the total cost of its development and manufacture – including the initial production of missiles – was an estimated $1.6 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;haalong&quot; /&gt; The price of a single Arrow missile was estimated at $3 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;haalong&quot; /&gt; Between 1989 and 2007 some $2.4 billion had been reportedly invested in the Arrow program, 50–80&lt;ref name=&quot;a3-80&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/newscast/0808/0709_arrow-3.html |publisher=''[http://www.defense-update.com/about.htm Defense Update]'' |title=Israel asks U.S. to support Arrow-3 | accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; percent of which was funded by the [[federal government of the United States|United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;defup&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Israel's strategic defense programs | publisher = ''[http://www.defense-update.com/about.htm Defense Update]'' | date = 2007-03-01 | accessdate=2009-08-19 | url = http://www.defense-update.com/features/du-2-06/feature-ILmissiledefense.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel contributes approximately $65 million annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;haalong&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = An Arrow to the heart | publisher = ''[[Haaretz]]'' | first=Amnon |last= Barzilai | accessdate=2009-09-18 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page/an-arrow-to-the-heart-1.28321?trailingPath=2.169%2C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism and opposition===
The Arrow program encountered opposition from the IAF, whose traditional doctrine of deterrence and use of preemptive strikes stand in sharp contrast with the nature of the missile. In addition, the IAF feared that the procurement of the costly missiles would diminish the resources allocated towards offensive projects such as fighter aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Duncan L.|last=Clarke|jstor=4328717 |title=The Arrow Missile: The United States, Israel and Strategic Cooperation |journal=Middle East Journal |publisher=Middle East Institute |volume=48 |issue=3 |page=478 |date=Summer 1994 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of the concept of missile defense for Israel was aired by Dr. [[Reuven Pedatzur]] in a comprehensive study&lt;ref name=&quot;peda&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |isbn=965-459-005-0 |publisher= Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies |place = [[Tel Aviv University]] |title=The Arrow project and active defense – challenges and questions | type = paper | number =42 |first= Reuven |last=Pedatzur |date=October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1993 by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Forerunner of the [[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|Institute for National Security Studies]] (INSS).&lt;/ref&gt; The arguments made in the study conformed to the opinions of numerous defense officials and analysts, and echoed many of the arguments made by the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] critics in the United States.&lt;ref name= &quot;inss&quot;&gt;{{cite web | place = IL | url = http://www.inss.org.il/upload/%28FILE%291216205936.pdf |format=PDF | pages = 67–69, 75–77 |publisher=[[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|Institute for National Security Studies]] |title = Missile defense and Israel's deterrence against a nuclear Iran |first=Uzi |last=Rubin |authorlink= Uzi Rubin |year=2008 |accessdate = 2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedatzur argued that it was exceedingly simple to fool an Arrow-type defensive system with simple, cheap, and easily installed countermeasures, which would render the Arrow system ineffective. He doubted Israel's defense industries could rise to the challenge of such a complex system, citing anonymous experts in the IDF who predicted that the system would not be available before 2010. He envisaged enormous costs, around $10 billion,&lt;ref name = &quot;haalong&quot; /&gt; that would distort budgeting priorities and divert funds from the vital enhancement of the IDF's warfighting capability, thus forcing a profound revision of Israel's national security doctrine.  He further argued that even if effective against missiles with [[conventional warfare|conventional]], [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[Biological warfare|biological]] [[warhead]]s, the Arrow would not be relevant against future threats of missiles with [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] warheads, since it would never be able to supply hermetic defense and the impact of even a single nuclear warhead in Israel's [[Population density|densely populated]] [[urban area]] would be an existential threat to Israel.&lt;ref name=dtic /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inss&quot; /&gt;

At the same time, [[John E. Pike]], who worked then with the [[Federation of American Scientists]], stated that &quot;given technical problems with the systems radar and command system, coupled with its high development cost, the Arrow program may soon fall by the wayside&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Pike  | first1 = John E | author1-link = John E.

In June 2003 a group of Israeli chief engineers, co-inventors, and project managers of IAI and subcontractors were awarded the [[Israel Defense Prize]] for the development and production of the Arrow system.&lt;ref name= &quot;prize&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iai.co.il/28973-25365-he/default.aspx?PageNum=4 |publisher=[[Israel Aerospace Industries]] | trans_title = Israel Defense Prize for 2003 to developers and directors of the Arrow weapon system | script-title=he:פרס ביטחון ישראל לשנת 2003 למפתחי ומנהלי מערכת נשק חץ |language= he |accessdate=2010-03-20 |date = 2003-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. [[Uzi Rubin]], first Director of IMDO, with the passage of time most of the pessimistic predictions have proven to be unfounded. Israel's defense industries overcame the technical challenge, the system's development was completed a full decade ahead of what was predicted, and there are no indications that the expenditures for the Arrow harmed other IDF procurement plans to any degree whatsoever.&lt;ref name=&quot;inss&quot; /&gt; Rubin insists that Israel's missile defense is now an established fact and that most of the warnings issued by critics have failed to materialize.&lt;ref name= &quot;inss&quot; /&gt; Pedatzur, however, remained unconvinced.&lt;ref name = &quot;peda3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;peda2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1065134.html | work = Haaretz | title = It's possible to live with Iran |first= Reuven |last= Pedatzur |date = 2009-02-18 |accessdate = 2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrow 1===
The first launch of the Arrow interceptor took place on August 9, 1990, designed to test the missile's control and guidance systems. The test came to a halt seconds after take off and the missile was intentionally destroyed due to fears it might go off track and hit a settled location. This was caused by the failure of the ground tracking radars to track the missile's [[trajectory]].&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt; Test number two took place on March 25, 1991. Designed to check missile components during launch, it was conducted from a ship at sea. Once again a missile malfunction resulted in the abortion of the experiment.&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt; A third test, designed to examine the Arrow's interception capabilities, was conducted on October 31, 1991. The missile was once again launched from a ship at sea, and was once more aborted because of a repeat of previous malfunctions.&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt;

On September 23, 1992, in another test of the missile components during launch, the systems finally operated as planned and the Arrow reached its designated point in the sky, 45 seconds after launch. As planned, the missile was then destroyed. This successful experiment ended the system's preliminary testing phase.&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt; The fifth, sixth, and seventh tests took place on February 28, July 14, and October 14, 1993 respectively. During these, the Arrow managed to pass in close proximity to the target missiles, thereby proving its ability to intercept surface-to-surface missiles.&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt; During test number eight on March 1, 1994, the missile was not launched due to a ground computer failure.&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt; The ninth test launch on June 12, 1994, also known as ATD#1 (Arrow Demonstration Test 1), saw an Arrow 1 successfully intercepted a target missile launched from a ship anchored in the middle of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt;&lt;ref name=tests&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Israel Missile Defense Organization |title=Story of the Arrow weapon system |url=http://www.mod.gov.il/pages/homa/bg.htm |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908222327/http://www.mod.gov.il:80/pages/homa/bg.htm |archivedate=2009-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arrow 1 was reportedly a two-stage [[solid propellant]] missile, with an overall length of {{convert|7.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a body diameter of {{convert|1200|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and a launch weight of around {{convert|2000|kg|abbr=on}}. It was estimated that the second stage had a length of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and that it had [[Inertial navigation system|inertial]] and [[Missile guidance#Command Off Line-Of-Sight (COLOS)|command update mid-course]] guidance, with a terminal [[Infrared homing|infrared]] [[focal plane]] array. The missile was described as being relatively high-speed and maneuverable, with [[thrust vectoring]] in the both stages. The range capability has been described as around {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=nti2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/israel_missile.pdf?_=1316466791 |publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] |title=Israel profile: Missile overview: Missile Chronology |format=PDF |date=January 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Arrow 1 could be a single stage missile.&lt;ref name=&quot;stav&quot; /&gt; Development of the &quot;big and cumbersome&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;uzi&quot; /&gt; Arrow 1 then ceased and further research continued with the &quot;smaller, faster and more lethal&quot; Arrow 2.&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt;&lt;ref name=tests/&gt;

Two successful tests (designated IIT#21 and IIT#22) of the steering, control and cruising systems were conducted without target missiles on July 30, 1995 and February 20, 1996.&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt;&lt;ref name=tests/&gt; Two successful interceptions took place on August 20, 1996 and March 11, 1997, and were designated AIT#21 and AIT#22.&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt;&lt;ref name=tests/&gt;
Another interception test (AIT#23) was conducted on August 20, 1997, but the missile was destroyed when its steering system malfunctioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;iafkg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tests&quot; /&gt; The fault was corrected in time to ensure the success of AST#3,&lt;ref name=iafkg/&gt;&lt;ref name=tests/&gt; the first comprehensive test of the entire system.

A full system interception test (AST#4) was held on November 1, 1999. During this test the Arrow system located, tracked and intercepted a TM-91C target missile simulating a &quot;Scud&quot; missile, launched on a very steep trajectory from a ship located offshore.&lt;ref name=tests/&gt;&lt;ref name=AST4-5-8-10/&gt; The IAI TM-91C target missile was itself based on the Arrow 1 interceptor.&lt;ref name=targets/&gt; On March 14, 2000, the first complete Arrow 2 battery was rolled out in a ceremony at [[Palmachim Airbase]].&lt;ref name=tests/&gt; In his speech, then IAF commander [[Aluf]] [[Eitan Ben Eliyahu]] said:
{{cquote |This is a great day for the Air Defense Forces, for the Air Force, the defense establishment and, I would say, for the State of Israel.

A successful test of the Arrow 2 block-2 took place on January 5, 2003 (AST#8).

On February 22, 2011 the Arrow system successfully intercepted a long-range&lt;ref name=block4-2011/&gt; ballistic target missile during a flight test conducted at NAS Point Mugu. The target missile was launched from a mobile launch platform off the coast of California, within the Point Mugu test range.&lt;ref name= &quot;mda2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mda.mil/news/11news0002.html |publisher=Missile Defense Agency |title=Joint U.S.-Israel Arrow weapon system intercepts target during successful missile defense test|date=2011-02-22 |accessdate= 2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test validated new block-4 versions designed to improve discriminating capabilities of the Arrow 2 interceptor.&lt;ref name=block4-2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=5777664 | work = [[Defense News]] |title=Arrow test hits target, validates new software |first=Barbara |last= Opall-Rome |date = 2011-02-25 | accessdate = 2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a body-to-body impact that completely destroyed the target.&lt;ref name=block4-2011 /&gt;

On February 10, 2012 developers successfully conducted the final target-tracking test prior to delivery of block-4 Arrow system. The Blue Sparrow target missile was detected and tracked by the radar, the intercept solutions were plotted by the battle management controller and transferred to the launch units.&lt;ref name= &quot;bl4&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://defense-update.com/20120210_super_gereen_pine_bms_test-2.html | work = Defense Update |first= Tamir |last=Eshel |title=Israel tests Arrow 2 block 4 ATBM with Super Green Pine radar |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate= 2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arieh Herzog]], block-4 upgrades &quot;improve the process of discrimination of what happens in the sky and the transmission of target data for much better situational control.&quot;&lt;ref name= block4-2011 /&gt; Block-4 upgrades also refine midcourse guidance which, when coupled with improved target identification and discrimination capabilities, improves lethality.&lt;ref name=block4-2011 /&gt;

====Block-5====
IMDO recently launched initial definition of a new block-5 upgrade to the complete Arrow system that will merge the lower-tier Arrow 2 and exoatmospheric Arrow 3 into a single national missile defense system. According to Arieh Herzog, the planned block-5 will include new ground- and airborne sensors, a [[command and control]] system, and a new target missile – the [[Sparrow target missile|Silver Sparrow]]&lt;ref name=Silver-b5 /&gt; – to simulate potentially nuclear-capable delivery vehicles developed by Iran.&lt;ref name=block5 /&gt;  According to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, block-5 is expected to be able to deal with &quot;more stressing regional threats&quot; by increasing total defended area by some 50 percent.&lt;ref name= Silver-b5&gt;{{cite web | format = Flickr | url = http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5068/5675446608_9a641ccd74_b.jpg |publisher=[[Imaginova]] | work = Space News |title= Israel to develop new Silver Sparrow air-launch target missile | first =Barbara |last= Opall-Rome |date = 2011-04-11 |accessdate= 2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planned block-5 will optimize the existing Super Green Pine radar to operate with the AN/TPY-2 radar as well as with radars commanding anti-ballistic missiles aboard [[United States Navy]] [[destroyer]]s. U.S. radars will be used to support [[Control theory#Closed-loop transfer function|closed-loop]] operations if Israel and U.S. targets in the region come under attack.&lt;ref name=block5 /&gt;

===Arrow 3===
{{main article|Arrow 3}}
By August 2008 the United States and Israeli governments have initiated development of an upper-tier component to the Israeli Air Defense Command, known as Arrow 3. The development is based on an architecture definition study conducted in 2006–2007, determining the need for the upper-tier component to be integrated into Israel's ballistic missile defense system. According to Arieh Herzog, the main element of this upper tier will be an exoatmospheric interceptor, to be jointly developed by IAI and Boeing.&lt;ref name=dua3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/products/a/arrow3.html |work=Defense Update|title=Israel, U.S. to embark on collaborative 'upper-tier' missile intercept program to include Arrow 3 and land-based SM-3 missiles |accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assigned targets can be handed over to the Patriot's [[MIM-104 Patriot#The AN/MPQ-53 and AN/MPQ-65 Radar Set|AN/MPQ-53]] fire control radar. Tests carried out by the U.S and Israel have successfully linked the Arrow with both U.S and Israeli versions of the Patriot.&lt;ref name=armytec/&gt;&lt;ref name=nti2 /&gt;

The &quot;Citron Tree&quot; has three banks of operator consoles laid out in a U shape. In the center sits the [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in command who oversees the engagement, but also has links to the other parts of the battery as well as to IAF [[headquarters]].  On the commander's right sits the engagement officer, who ensures that targets are assigned to other engagement officers sitting on the right-hand leg of the U. Each is assigned a geographical area to defend and two of the officers are more senior as they have an overview of Patriot batteries. To the left of the commander is the resource officer, who monitors the status and readiness of the missiles. On the left of the U sits the sky picture officer, who is in contact with the [[Home Front Command]] and uses the center's ability to predict impact point to alert the [[Civil defense in Israel|civil authorities]]. Also at these consoles are an [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] officer and an [[After Action Review|after-action]]/[[Debriefing|debrief]] officer, who uses recordings as it is impossible to absorb all the information during engagements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egozi2&quot;/&gt;  All in all, the &quot;Golden Citron&quot; is manned by 7–10 operators.&lt;ref name=Bar-Joseph /&gt;

===Brown Hazelnut===
The &quot;Brown Hazelnut&quot; ({{lang-he|אגוז חום}}, {{IPA-he |eɡoz χum|pron}}) launch control center is located at the launch site,&lt;ref name = &quot;iaibr&quot;/&gt; up to {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr = on}} from the &quot;Golden Citron&quot; fire control center.&lt;ref name= armytec /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mdaa2&quot; /&gt; It employs [[microwave]] and [[radio]] data and voice communications links to the &quot;Green Pine&quot; and &quot;Golden Citron&quot;.

Israel initially produced the Arrow system domestically,&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Except for Lockheed Martin's active radar seeker.&lt;/ref&gt; but on February 11, 2003 IAI and Boeing signed an agreement, valued at over $25 million for fiscal years 2003–2004,&lt;ref name=boeing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/arrow/docs/Arrow_overview.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=Boeing |title=Arrow II brochure |accessdate=2009-08-19 |date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish production facilities for the manufacture of components for the Arrow missile in the United States. In March 2004, IAI awarded a $78 million production contract to Boeing; the total contract value could exceed $225 million through second quarter 2008.&lt;ref name=boeing/&gt; As a result of successful implementation of this contract Boeing is responsible for production of about 35 percent of Arrow missile components, including the electronics section, booster motor case and missile canister,&lt;ref name=boeing/&gt; at its [[Huntsville, Alabama]] facilities.&lt;ref name=opalrome/&gt; IAI, the prime contractor of the Arrow system, is responsible for integration and the final assembly of the Arrow missile in Israel.&lt;ref name=tests/&gt; Boeing also coordinates the production of Arrow missile components manufactured by more than 150 American companies located in over 25 states.&lt;ref name=boeing150&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2003/q1/nr_030211m.htm |publisher=Boeing |title=Israel Aircraft Industries and Boeing sign an agreement to establish production infrastructure to manufacture Arrow missile components in the United State |accessdate=2009-10-12 |date=2003-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing delivered its first Arrow 2 interceptor to Israel in 2005.&lt;ref name=mstrt/&gt;&lt;ref name=boeing/&gt; Co-produced interceptors has been tested since February 12, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;mda2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mda.mil/global/documents/pdf/07fyi0096.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Missile Defense Agency |title=U.S./Israel complete successful Arrow missile defense test|date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final deliveries to the Israel Air Force were planned by the end of 2010.&lt;ref name=block5/&gt;

==Deployment==
According to its original 1986 schedule, the Arrow system was supposed to enter operational service in 1995.&lt;ref name=global/&gt; The first operational Arrow battery was deployed, however, in March 2000 in [[Palmachim Airbase]], near the city of [[Rishon LeZion]], south of the [[Tel Aviv]] [[metropolitan area]]. It was declared operational in October 2000, and reached its full capacity in March 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;video&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iai.co.il/sip_storage/files/6/34806.wmv |format=WMV |publisher=[[Israel Aerospace Industries]] |author=Israel Missile Defense Organization and United States Ballistic Missile Defense Organization |title=Arrow missile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deployment of the second battery at [[Ein Shemer]] ([[Ein Shemer Airfield]]),&lt;ref name=mstrt/&gt; near the city of [[Hadera]], [[Haifa District]], northern Israel, was delayed by strong opposition from local residents who feared its radar would be hazardous to their health.&lt;ref name=global/&gt; The situation was eventually resolved and Israel's second battery completed its deployment, turned operational and linked up with first battery in October 2002. In 2007 the IDF has reportedly decided to modify its missile defense doctrine and in order to counter possible Syrian and Iranian missile [[Barrage (artillery)|barrages]] and has quietly modified its deployment of the Arrow in northern Israel.&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=73129 |publisher=''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' |title=IDF modifying Arrow deployment in the North |first=Yaakov |last= Katz |date=2007-08-23 |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDF planned to procure 50&lt;ref name=sipri /&gt;–100 interceptors for each battery.&lt;ref name=mstrt/&gt; As of 1998, a battery was estimated to cost about $170 million.&lt;ref name=global/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;batcost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/israel/missile2000.htm |publisher=[[Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control]] |title=Israel missile update – 2000 |year=2000 |accessdate=2009-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328164425/http://www.wisconsinproject.org:80/countries/israel/missile2000.htm |archivedate=2010-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;With four launchers.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, reportedly one &quot;Great Pine&quot; radar is deployed alongside two &quot;Green Pine&quot; radars.&lt;ref name=iai-boeing-a3/&gt;

Israel had originally planned to deploy two Arrow 2 batteries but has since sought and won promises of funding for a third battery.&lt;ref name=global/&gt; Some reports stated that a third battery was already deployed,&lt;ref name=&quot;inss&quot; /&gt; or in development in the south,&lt;ref name=mstrt/&gt; while others claimed that a decision on deployment of a third battery has not yet been made, although it was under discussion for service entry in 2012.&lt;ref name=armytec/&gt;&lt;ref name=nti/&gt;&lt;ref name=global/&gt; Another report stated that Israel planned to deploy not one, but two additional Arrow 2 batteries to defend the country's southern region, also covering sensitive sites such as the Negev Nuclear Research Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;a3-80&quot;/&gt; However the decision about the third battery was taken in October 2010.&lt;ref name =&quot;third battery&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/Tech/10/10/1402.htm |first=Bar Josephine |last=Dadon |publisher=''[[Bamahane]]'' |title=A third antimissile battery on its way | accessdate = 2010-10-14 |date= 2010-10-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101016165248/http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/Tech/10/10/1402.htm| archivedate= 16 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new battery was expected to be put into operational use in 2012 in the center of the country.&lt;ref name= &quot;third battery2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idf.il/1086-14882-EN/Dover.aspx |first= Shir Aharon |last= Bram | publisher =[[Israel Defense Forces]] |title=Arrow missile defense battery to be deployed in central Israel | accessdate = 2012-03-13 |date= 2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Jane's Defence Weekly]]'', some sources indicate that the new Arrow 2 battery became operational in 2012 in an Israeli Air Force facility at [[Tal Shahar]], roughly halfway between [[Jerusalem]] and [[Ashdod]], near [[Beit Shemesh]].&lt;ref name= &quot;janesTalShahar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7443/8910085466_b8037e498f_o.jpg |first=Jeremy |last=Binnie | publisher =[[Jane's Information Group]] |title=Israeli BMD facility details revealed |year=2013 |accessdate = 2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Export===
Apart from Israel no country has purchased a full Arrow system, although [[India]] had acquired and deployed three &quot;Green Pine&quot; radars by August 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;india&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/india/bmd.htm |first=John E |last=Pike |authorlink = John E.

[[Turkey]] also planned to buy anti-missile air defense systems worth more than $1 billion. The Arrow was considered a potential contender,&lt;ref name= turkey&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3927941 | work = [[Defense News]] |title= Turk–Israeli deals threatened by Gaza |first1 = Umit | last1 = Enginsoy | last2=Bekdil | first2 = Burak Ege |date= 2009-02-02 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was rejected on political grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://dmilt.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6028:turkey-re-launch-and-new-clauses-to-the-t-loramids-tender&amp;catid=3:asia&amp;Itemid=56 | title = Turkey; Re-launch and new clauses to the T-LORAMIDS tender | publisher = Dmilt | date = March 23, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Japan]], and [[Singapore]] were mentioned as then potential foreign customers of the Arrow system.&lt;ref name=dtic /&gt;&lt;ref name= global /&gt; [[Netherlands]] reportedly expressed interest in the &quot;Golden Citron&quot; [[C4ISTAR|C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;I]] center in November 1999.&lt;ref name=dtic /&gt;

In the late 1990s officials of [[Jordan]] have expressed concern that any conflagration between Israel and Iraq or Iran would impact its territory. The problem becomes more difficult for Jordan when the warheads are not conventional. Therefore, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], during his first term of office as Prime Minister of Israel, reportedly offered Jordan &quot;a defensive umbrella of Arrow 2&quot;. Without allowing Israel to forward deploy the Arrow launchers close to the Iraqi border, the other option is for Israel to sell Jordan the Arrow system. This is most likely what Prime Minister Netanyahu meant above. In May 1999 Israel reportedly requested U.S. approval for selling Arrow batteries to Jordan, but apparently no such approval has been given yet.&lt;ref name=dtic&gt;{{cite web | first = Guermantes E. |last=Lailari | title = Israel's national missile defense strategy | format = PDF | publisher = [[Defense Technical Information Center]]  | date = April 2001 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA407050&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf | accessdate = 2009-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed with marketing approval by their respective governments, a U.S.–Israeli industrial team plans to offer the Arrow system to [[South Korea]].  The potential deal, estimated to exceed $1 billion.&lt;ref name = a3-sk&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120130/DEFREG04/301300005/IAI-Boeing-Ready-Arrow-Export-8212-S-Korea-? | work = [[Defense News]] |title= IAI, Boeing ready Arrow for export — to S.

For the United States, the Arrow has provided important technical and operational data.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewish&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;mda3&quot; /&gt; It remains a key element in the Missile Defense Agency’s plan for a layered missile defense architecture, and an example of a successful, affordable program. At the moment, however, the United States does not have any plans to procure and deploy the Arrow.&lt;ref name=mstrt/&gt; Nevertheless, in September 2009 the Arrow system was mentioned by then U.S. [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] and then [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[General (United States)|General]] [[James Cartwright]] among the alternative to the proposed [[US missile defense complex in Poland|U.S. missile defense assets in Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;europe&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4479 |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |title=DoD news briefing with secretary Gates and Gen.

In a June 2011 interview [[Lieutenant General]] [[Patrick J. O'Reilly]] said that Arrow 2 will be integrated into a regional defense array planned by the U.S. in the [[Middle East]].
