==Article Name==
I can find no source that refers to this action as the battle of papeete. To the contrary every source i have read has refered to this specifically as the bombardment of Papeete. Can anyone find a source stating to the contrary?[[User:XavierGreen|XavierGreen]] ([[User talk:XavierGreen|talk]]) 05:55, 5 January 2010 (UTC)

== Couple of extra things for possible inclusion ==

Was digging around in some French sources for more on Maxime Destremau and the bombardment of Papeete, and I found the following:
*[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblans-et-Velotte Amblans-et-Velotte] (location of Destremau's grave)
*[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbres_de_Polyn%C3%A9sie_fran%C3%A7aise_2007 Timbres de Polynésie française 2007] (stamp was issued featuring the Zélée)
*[http://pages14-18.mesdiscussions.net/pages1418/Forum-Pages-d-Histoire-aviation-marine/marine-1914-1918/canonniere-zelee-sujet_535_1.htm Forum discussion on the bombardment] (includes some nice pictures of Destremau).
*[http://gw4.geneanet.org/index.php3?b=pierfit&amp;lang=en;p=maxime;n=destremau Another Destremau biography] (includes family tree)
*[http://histoire.itereva.net/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=117 Les ÉFO dans la Première Guerre Mondiale] from the [http://histoire.itereva.net/ Association des Historiens Géographes de Polynésie Française] - that document tells us there are streets in Papeete named after the gunboat Zélée and after Destremau.
*[http://www.tahitiheritage.pf/fiche-canon-de-la-ze-23904.htm Tourist website], says one of the cannons is still there on display.
Of course, not all those sources will be reliable, but it might give ideas for where to look in other sources. Hope that helps. [[User:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]] ([[User talk:Carcharoth|talk]]) 01:17, 9 February 2010 (UTC)
:A few more things:
:*Which ship was Spee on during all this? Other articles say his flagship was ''Scharnhorst''.
::He was on Scharnhost, ive added this to the text.
:*Where was Spee when he heard of the outbreak of war? Other articles say he was at Ponape.
::Yes he on the Scharnhorst at Ponape, but left for Pagan to rendevouz with the fleet.[[User:XavierGreen|XavierGreen]] ([[User talk:XavierGreen|talk]]) 19:54, 10 February 2010 (UTC)
:*You have a picture of the ship that was sunk. Would pictures of one or other or both of the German ships involved be overdoing the pictures?
::I readded the original picture of Scharhorst that used to be on the page.[[User:XavierGreen|XavierGreen]] ([[User talk:XavierGreen|talk]]) 02:38, 12 February 2010 (UTC)
:*You link to [[German Empire]] in the infobox and for &quot;German&quot;. Might it be an idea to link to [[French Third Republic]] for France in the infobox and for &quot;French&quot; in the article, rather than link to [[France]]?
::I fixed this.[[User:XavierGreen|XavierGreen]] ([[User talk:XavierGreen|talk]]) 19:54, 10 February 2010 (UTC)
:*Some of the linking is repetitive and the first instances of something are not being linked but later ones are.
:*I created [[Arthur W. Jose]] as a redirect to [[Arthur Wilberforce Jose]] (1863-1934), who is the author of the work you have cited. What you have cited is volume IX of the 9th edition (1941) of the [[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918]]. The [http://www.awm.gov.au/histories/first_world_war/volume.asp?levelID=67895 page cited] tells us that Jose was ''&quot;writing in the 1920s&quot;'' (volume IX was first published in 1928), so that needs to be taken into account when comparing the dates of the sources. I have no idea what changes were made between editions of that official Australian history.

== Appendix number 14 - The German Cruiser Squadron at Papeete ==

From your citations, you have referred to [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/10/chapters/28.pdf Appendix number 14 - The German Cruiser Squadron at Papeete], an appendix to the [[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918]] - Volume IX – The Royal Australian Navy, 1914–1918. That appendix has some fascinating bits. Some factual stuff from there could easily be added to this article to expand it (e.g. the signal fires on Moorea, the cheeky farewell to the French brigadier at Bora-Bora by hoisting German colours, the mining of the harbour, the volunteer corps of Taihitians, and the number of shells - stated in this source to be 49). I was a bit surprised to read there that the shelling of the town seems to have been almost an afterthought, &quot;to impress the natives&quot;. I presume this is contradicted by other sources, as the impression from this article is that the decision to withdraw was only taken after the shelling. Of course, the people that could really tell us what the German sailors were thinking nearly all died at the Falklands battle, so quite how the later historians work out what Spee's intentions and decisions were, I don't know (actually, seeing the pictures of Spee being received at Valparaiso, he must have left reports there, or otherwise transmitted reports - there is a footnote referring to the official German history of this encounter).

== Questions ==

An interesting article about a battle that's new to me. Thanks for writing and, later, editting it.

What rank was Destremau? The article identifies him as a lieutenant and a captain. If he's French Navy, that's a huge rank spread. 

What makes armored cars &quot;armored&quot; is not weapons, as the article states &quot;Several Ford trucks were turned into impromptu armored cars by mounting them with Zélée's 37-mm guns...&quot; but armor. Were they ''armored'' or merely ''armed''? [[Special:Contributions/155.213.224.59|155.213.224.59]] ([[User talk:155.213.224.59|talk]]) 15:22, 22 September 2014 (UTC)</text>
