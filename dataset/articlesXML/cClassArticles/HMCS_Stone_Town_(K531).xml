'''HMCS ''Stone Town''''' was a [[River-class frigate]] that served with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[Second World War]]. She served primarily as a convoy escort in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. She was named for [[St. Marys, Ontario]], however there was already a ship by that name within the Commonwealth navies so they chose the nickname of the town for its representation.&lt;ref name=Macpherson&gt;{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910–1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages= |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uboat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/199.html|work=uboat.net |title=HMCS Stone Town (K 531) |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war she was re-purposed as a [[weather ship]] for use by the [[Department of Transport]] of Canada.

''Stone Town'' was ordered 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943–1944 River-class building program.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt; She was laid down on 17 November 1943 by [[Canadian Vickers|Canadian Vickers Ltd.]] at [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] and launched 28 March 1944.&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt; She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 21 July 1944 at Montreal.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|River-class frigate}}

The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a &quot;twin-screw corvette&quot;, its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the [[Royal Navy]] at the time, including the [[Flower-class corvette]]. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the [[United Kingdom]], giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.friends-amis.org/index.php/en/document-repository/english/fact-sheets/44-canadian-river-class-frigate-1/file |title=Fact Sheet No. 21 – Canadian River Class Frigates |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;frigate&quot; was suggested by Vice-Admiral [[Percy Nelles]] of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2&gt;{{cite book|title=Frigates of the Royal Canadian Navy 1943–1974 |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |publisher=Vanwell Publishing |year=1989 |place=Lewiston, New York |pages=6–7, 15 |isbn=0920277225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at {{convert|7200|nmi|km}} at 12 knots.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat [[U-boats]] including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt; 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of {{HMCS|Valleyfield|K329|6}}, they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the Royal Canadian Navy's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; The design was too big for the shipyards on the [[Great Lakes]] so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the [[St. Lawrence River]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

==War service==
Beginning in September 1944, ''Stone Town'' performed workups in [[Bermuda]]. Upon her return she was assigned to the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] group C-8 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. She was named Senior Officer's Ship and remained with the group crossing the Atlantic until May 1945, returning to Canada that month.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

On 22 July 1945 ''Stone Town'' began a tropicalization refit at [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]] in preparation for service in the southern [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; This meant installing water-cooling and refrigeration abilities and changing the camouflage pattern.&lt;ref name=Paterson&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cowichanvalleycitizen.com/living/gallant-hmcs-prince-rupert-served-on-the-newfie-derry-run-1.159128 |title=Gallant HMCS Prince Rupert served on the 'Newfie-Derry' run |work=Cowichan Valley Citizen |first=T.W. |last=Paterson |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, work was stopped on 24 August due to the surrender of [[Japan]]. ''Stone Town'' was paid off on 13 November 1945 at Lunenburg and laid up for disposal at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

==Postwar service==
In 1950 Canada became responsible for operating weather ship P (Peter) in the Northern [[Pacific Ocean]]. As a result, the Government of Canada re-acquired ''Stone Town'' and her sister ship {{HMCS|St. Catharines|K325|6}} and sent them for conversion to weather ships at [[Sorel, Quebec]].&lt;ref name=Usque&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/eng/CCG/USQUE_Weather_Ships |title=ARCHIVED – USQUE AD MARE A History of the Canadian Coast Guard and Marine Services |last=Appleton |first=Thomas A. |work=Canadian Coast Guard |date=24 June 2013 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson states that ''Stone Town''{{'}}s conversion was done in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].&lt;/ref&gt; They were repainted with black hulls and white superstructures and buff funnels with black tops, and sent out to the position of weather ship P as CGS ''St. Catharines'' and CGS ''Stone Town'' respectively.&lt;ref name=Usque/&gt; Once at that position they were to provide positional information for long range, propeller flights over the Pacific and weather forecasting and measurement of winds aloft.&lt;ref name=Weather&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jproc.ca/rrp/rrp2/wxship.html |title=Radio Research Paper – Canadian Weather Ships |last=Proc |first=Jerry |work=Radio Communications and Signals Intelligence of the Royal Canadian Navy |date=5 August 2013 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, she was transferred to the newly formed [[Canadian Coast Guard]] and repainted in their colours. She remained at this post until 1967 when she was relieved by CGS ''Quadra''. She was sold in 1968, supposedly for conversion to a fishing vessel.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; Her ship's bell was given to St. Marys, Ontario and is currently on display at the St. Marys Museum.&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt;
