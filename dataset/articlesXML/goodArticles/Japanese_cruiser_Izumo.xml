{{nihongo|'''''Izumo'''''|出雲||sometimes transliterated ''Idzumo''}} was the [[lead ship]] of [[Izumo-class cruiser|her class]] of [[armored cruiser]]s built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the ship was built in Britain. She often served as a [[flagship]] and participated in most of the naval battles of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–05. The ship was lightly damaged during the [[Battle off Ulsan]] and the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. ''Izumo'' was ordered to protect Japanese citizens and interests in 1913 during the [[Mexican Revolution]] and was still there when World War I began in 1914.

She was then tasked to search for German [[commerce raiders]] and protect [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] shipping off the western coasts of North and Central America. The ship assisted the armored cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Asama||2}} in early 1915 when she struck a rock off [[Baja California]]. In 1917, ''Izumo'' became the flagship of the Japanese [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] deployed in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. After the war, she sailed to Great Britain to take control of some ex-German [[submarine]]s and then escorted them part of the way back to Japan.

The ship spent most of the 1920s as a [[training ship]] for [[naval cadet]]s and became flagship of the IJN's China forces in 1932 during the [[First Shanghai Incident]]. ''Izumo'' participated in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] five years later and was not damaged, despite repeated aerial attacks. The ship played a minor role in the [[Pacific War]], supporting Japanese forces during [[Philippines Campaign (1941–1942)|Philippines Campaign]] until she struck a [[naval mine|mine]]. She returned to Japan in 1943 and again became a training ship for naval cadets. ''Izumo'' was sunk by American carrier aircraft during the [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|attack on Kure]] in July 1945. Her wreck was [[Marine salvage|refloated]] and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1947.

==Background and description==
The 1896 Naval Expansion Plan was made after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and included four armored cruisers in addition to four more battleships, all of which had to be ordered from British shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself. Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships. The revised plan is commonly known as the &quot;Six-Six Fleet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Peattie, pp. 57–62&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most of their contemporaries which were designed for [[commerce raiding]] or to defend colonies and trade routes, ''Izumo'' and her half-[[sister ship|sisters]] were intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the [[line of battle|battleline]].&lt;ref&gt;Milanovich, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was {{convert|132.28|m|ftin|sp=us}} long [[length overall|overall]] and {{convert|121.92|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20.94|m|ftin|sp=us}} and had an average [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|7.26|m|ftin|sp=us}}. ''Izumo'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|9503|t|LT|sp=us}} at normal load and {{convert|10305|t|LT|sp=us}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|0.88|m|ftin|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Milanovich, pp. 74, 80&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew consisted of 672 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=j2&gt;Jentschura, Jung &amp; Mickel, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

''Izumo'' had two 4-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving a single [[propeller shaft]].&lt;ref&gt;Milanovich, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Steam for the engines was provided by 24 [[Belleville boiler]]s and the engines were rated at a total of {{convert|14500|ihp|lk=on}}. The ship had a designed speed of {{convert|20.75|kn|lk=in}} and reached {{convert|21.74|kn}} during her [[sea trial]]s from {{convert|16078|ihp|abbr=on}}. She carried up to {{convert|1551|t|LT|sp=us|disp=flip}} of coal&lt;ref name=b9&gt;Brook 1999, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; and could steam for {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

The [[main battery|main armament]] for all of the &quot;Six-Six Fleet&quot; armored cruisers was four [[20.3 cm/45 Type 41 naval gun|eight-inch guns]] in twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft of the [[superstructure]]. The [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] consisted of 14 [[Elswick Ordnance Company]] &quot;Pattern Z&quot; [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]], {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns. Only four of these guns were not mounted in armored [[casemate]]s on the main and upper decks and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by [[gun shield]]s. ''Izumo'' was also equipped with a dozen [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder 12-cwt guns]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;Cwt&quot; is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.&lt;/ref&gt; and eight QF 2.5-pounder [[Hotchkiss gun|Yamauchi guns]] as close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. The ship  was equipped with four submerged {{convert|457|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each [[broadside]].&lt;ref&gt;Milanovich, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the &quot;Six-Six Fleet&quot; armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences. The [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] of [[Krupp cemented armor]] ran the full length of the ship and its thickness varied from {{convert|178|mm|in|sp=us}} amidships to {{convert|89|mm|in|sp=us}} at the bow and stern. It had a height of {{convert|2.13|m|ftin|sp=us}}, of which {{convert|1.39|m|ftin|sp=us}} was normally underwater. The upper [[strake]] of belt armor was {{convert|127|mm|in|sp=us}} thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck. It extended {{convert|51.18|m|ftin|sp=us}} from the forward to the rear [[barbette]]. The ''Izumo'' class had oblique 127&amp;nbsp;mm armored [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s that closed off the ends of the central armored citadel.&lt;ref&gt;Milanovich, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

The barbettes, gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 6 inches thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by {{convert|51|mm|in|sp=us}} of armor. The deck was {{convert|63|mm|in|sp=us}} thick and the armor protecting the [[conning tower]] was {{convert|356|mm|in|sp=us}} in thickness.&lt;ref name=Conway&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
[[File:Japanese cruiser Izumo 1902.jpg|''Izumo'' in 1902|thumb|''Izumo'' at anchor in 1902]]
The contract for ''Izumo'', named after the [[Izumo Province|eponymous province]],&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; was signed on 24 September 1897 with [[Armstrong Whitworth]]. The ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] at their shipyard in [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]] on 14 May 1898 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 19 September. She was completed on 25 September 1900 and departed for Japan on 2 October&lt;ref&gt;Milanovich, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Inoue Toshio]], who had been appointed to supervise her construction and bring her back to Japan on 29 September 1899. ''Izumo'' arrived in [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]] on 8 December and Inoue was confirmed in his command.&lt;ref name=hk&gt;Hackett &amp; Kingsepp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russo-Japanese War===
At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, ''Izumo'', now under the command of Captain [[Miyaoka Naoki]],&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; was the flagship of Vice Admiral [[Kamimura Hikonojō]], commander of the [[2nd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|2nd Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Kowner, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] on 9 February 1904, when [[Vice Admiral]] [[Tōgō Heihachirō]] led the [[Combined Fleet]] in an attack on the Russian ships of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Squadron]] anchored just outside [[Lüshunkou District|Port Arthur]]. Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Boyarin|1901|2}}, which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered some 150, while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, I, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

In early March, Kamimura was tasked to take the reinforced 2nd Division north and make a diversion off [[Vladivostok]]. While scouting for Russian ships in the area, the Japanese cruisers bombarded the harbor and defenses of Vladivostok on 6 March to little effect. Upon their return to Japan a few days later, the 2nd Division was ordered to escort the transports ferrying the [[Imperial Guards Division]] to Korea and then to join the ships blockading Port Arthur. Kamimura was ordered north in mid-April to cover the [[Sea of Japan]] and defend the [[Korea Strait]] against any attempt by the Vladivostok Independent Cruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Karl Jessen]], to break through and unite with the Pacific Squadron. The two units narrowly missed each other on the 24th in heavy fog and the Japanese proceeded to Vladivostok where they laid several [[minefield]]s before arriving back at [[Wonsan]] on the 30th.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, I, pp. 138–39, 142–45, 160, 177, 188–89, 191–96&lt;/ref&gt;

The division failed to intercept the Russian squadron as it attacked [[Hitachi Maru Incident|several transports]] south of [[Okinoshima, Shimane|Okinoshima Island]] on 15 June due to heavy rain and fog. The Russians sortied again on 30 June and Kamimura finally was able to intercept them the next day near Okinoshima. The light was failing when they were spotted and the Russians were able to disengage in the darkness. Jessen's ships sortied again on 17 July headed for the eastern coast of Japan to act as a diversion and pull Japanese forces out of the Sea of Japan and the [[Yellow Sea]]. The Russian ships passed through [[Tsugaru Strait]] two days later and began capturing ships bound for Japan. The arrival of the Russians off [[Tokyo Bay]] on the 24th caused the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff|Naval General Staff]] to order Kamimura to sail for Cape Toi Misaki, [[Kyūshū]], fearing that Jessen would circumnavigate Japan to reach Port Arthur. Two days later he was ordered north to the [[Kii Channel]] and then to Tokyo Bay on the 28th. The General Staff finally ordered him back to [[Tsushima Island]] on the 30th; later that day he received word that Jessen's ships had passed through the Tsugaru Strait early that morning and reached Vladivostok on 1 August.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, I, pp. 283–89, 319–25, 337–51&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle off Ulsan====
{{main|Battle off Ulsan}}
On 10 August, the ships at Port Arthur attempted a breakout to Vladivostok, but were turned back in the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]]. Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them, but the order was delayed. His three armored cruisers, {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rossia||2}}, {{ship|Russian cruiser|Gromoboi||2}}, and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rurik|1892|2}}, had to raise steam, so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August. By dawn he had reached Tsushima, but turned back when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron. {{Convert|36|mi|0}} north of the island he encountered Kamimura's squadron, which consisted of four modern armored cruisers, {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Iwate||2}}, {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tokiwa||2}}, {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Azuma||2}}, and ''Izumo''. The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting one another and each had reversed course around first light. This put the Japanese ships astride the Russian route to Vladivostok.&lt;ref&gt;Brook 2000, pp. 34, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessen ordered his ships to turn to the northeast when he spotted the Japanese at 05:00 and they followed suit, albeit on a slightly converging course. Both sides opened fire around 05:23 at a range of {{convert|8500|m|yd|sp=us}}. The Japanese ships concentrated their fire on ''Rurik'', the rear ship of the Russian formation. She was hit fairly quickly and began to fall astern of the other two ships. Jessen turned southeast in an attempt to open the range, but this blinded the Russian gunners with the rising sun and prevented any of their broadside guns from bearing on the Japanese. About 06:00, Jessen turned 180° to starboard in an attempt to reach the Korean coast and to allow ''Rurik'' to rejoin the squadron. Kamimura followed suit around 06:10, but turned to port, which opened the range between the squadrons. ''Azuma'' then developed engine problems and the Japanese squadron slowed to conform with her best speed. Firing recommenced at 06:24 and ''Rurik'' was hit three times in the stern, flooding her steering compartment; she had to be steered with her engines. Her speed continued to decrease, further exposing her to Japanese fire, and her steering jammed to port around 06:40.&lt;ref&gt;Brook 2000, pp. 39, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessen made another 180° turn in an attempt to interpose his two ships between the Japanese and ''Rurik'', but the latter ship suddenly turn to starboard and increased speed and passed between Jessen's ships and the Japanese. Kamimura turned 180° as well so that both squadrons were heading southeast on parallel courses, but Jessen quickly made another 180° turn so that they headed on opposing courses. The Russians reversed course for the third time around 07:45 in another attempt to support ''Rurik'' although ''Rossia'' was on fire herself; her fires were extinguished about twenty minutes later. Kamimura circled ''Rurik'' to the south at 08:00 and allowed the other two Russian ships to get to his north and gave them an uncontested route to Vladivostok. Despite this, Jessen turned back once more at 08:15 and ordered ''Rurik'' to make her own way back to Vladivostok before turning north at his maximum speed, about {{convert|18|kn}}.&lt;ref name=b3&gt;Brook 2000, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

About this time Kamimura's two elderly protected cruisers, {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Naniwa||2}} and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Takachiho||2}}, were approaching from the south. Their arrival allowed Kamimura to pursue Jessen with all of his armored cruisers while the two new arrivals dealt with ''Rurik''. They fought a running battle with the Russians for the next hour and a half; scoring enough hits on them to force their speed down to {{convert|15|kn}}. The Japanese closed to a minimum of about {{convert|5000|m|yd|sp=us}}, but Kamimura then opened the range up to {{convert|6500|m|yd|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=b3/&gt;

About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously informed him that ''Izumo'' had expended three-quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He did not wish to leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on ''Rurik''. By this time she had been sunk by ''Naniwa'' and ''Takachiho''. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, but he did not receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, ''Gromoboi'' and ''Rossia'' were forced to [[heave-to]] to make repairs. None of the Japanese ships were seriously damaged; despite ''Izumo'' receiving over 20 hits, she only suffered 3 men killed and 16 wounded during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Brook 2000, pp. 43, 45; Watts &amp; Gordon, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; She began repairs at [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]] in mid-September.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, II, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 1905, Kamimura hoisted his flag again in ''Izumo'' at Sasebo and then escorted several troop convoys to Wonsan on February. On 13 April, the 2nd Division, including the armored cruisers ''Tokiwa'' and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kasuga||2}}, sailed to escort [[minelayers]] as they laid 715 [[naval mine|mines]] off Vladivostok.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, II, pp. 159–61, 177&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Tsushima====
{{main|Battle of Tsushima}}
As the Russian [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons]] approached Japan on 27 May, having sailed from the [[Baltic Sea]], they were spotted by patrolling Japanese ships early that morning, but visibility was limited and radio reception poor. The preliminary reports were enough to cause Tōgō to order his ships to put to sea and the 2nd Division spotted the Russian ships under the command of Vice Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]] at around 11:30. Kamimura closed to about a range of {{convert|8000|m|yd|sp=us}} before sheering off under fire to join Tōgō's battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, II, pp. 232, 235&lt;/ref&gt; ''Izumo'' was leading the 2nd Division when Tōgō opened fire on the 2nd Pacific Squadron at 14:10 and, like most of the ships in the division, engaged the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Oslyabya||2}} which was forced to fall out of formation at 14:50 and sank 20 minutes later. By this time the Russian formation was in disorder and ''Knyaz Suvorov'' suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15:35 at a range of about {{convert|2000|m|sp=us}}. All of Kamimura's ships engaged her for five minutes or so with ''Azuma'' and the armored cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Yakumo||2}} also firing torpedoes at the Russian ship without effect.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Part 2, pp. 128–32&lt;/ref&gt;

After 17:30 Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers, leaving Tōgō's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when the range closed to {{convert|8000|-|9000|m|yd|sp=us}}. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20:08 as night was falling.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Part 3, pp. 186–87&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral [[Nikolai Nebogatov]] therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, II, pp. 319–20&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the battle, ''Izumo'' was struck by five large shells, mostly 12-inch, and three smaller shells, mostly 6-inch. They caused only minor damage, although one 12-inch shell, which pierced a boiler uptake, could have disabled all of the middle boilers had it detonated.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Part 4, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; The shells killed 4 men and wounded 26 others.&lt;ref&gt;Brook 1999, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

As the IJN was preparing to invade [[Sakhalin]] Island in early July, Kamimura's 2nd Division, now reduced to ''Iwate'', ''Izumo'', and ''Tokiwa'', was tasked to defend the Korea Strait before it escorted troops that made an [[amphibious landing]] in northeastern Korea. In mid-August, the division covered the landing at [[Chongjin]], closer to the Russian border.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, II, pp. 356, 363–65, 377–80&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 1909, under command of Captain [[Isamu Takeshita|Takeshita Isamu]], ''Izumo'' departed [[Yokohama]] for the [[United States]] to participate in the [[Portola Festival]] at [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], a city-wide fair held on 19–23 October to mark the 140th anniversary of the [[Portolà expedition]], the first recorded Spanish (and European) land entry and exploration of present-day California, and to proclaim to the world that San Francisco was recovered from its devastating [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1909-06-27/ed-1/seq-49/;words=Albany+Portola?date1=1909&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=basic&amp;state=&amp;date2=1909&amp;proxtext=albany+portola&amp;y=11&amp;x=17&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;index=1|title=Warships Coming for Portola Fete|date=27 June 1909|work=San Francisco Call|publisher=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers|page=49|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Prince [[Shimazu Tadashige]] was assigned to the ship during this visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC19091012.2.83&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=------190-en--20--1--txt-txIN-idzumo------#|title=Guns of Harbor Roar Salute to Flag of Nippon|date=12 October 1909|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|work=San Francisco Call|page=16|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made port calls in [[Hawaii]], [[Monterrey]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], and [[San Diego]] en route.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; On 12 November 1913, ''Izumo'' was ordered to patrol the west coast of [[Mexico]] to safeguard Japanese interests and nationals during the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC19131112.2.2&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=------191-en--20--1--txt-txIN-izumo------#|title=Japanese Cruiser Sent to Mexico|date=12 November 1913|work=San Francisco Call|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|page=2|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
When Japan declared war on the Central Powers in August 1914, ''Izumo'' was still off the Mexican coast and was ordered to protect Allied shipping there and search for German commerce raiders.&lt;ref name=sax&gt;Saxon&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 November, the ship, then off San Francisco, was ordered to join a British task force commanded by Admiral Sir [[George Patey]] off [[San Clemente Island]] that included the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMAS|Australia|1911|2}} and the [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Newcastle|1909|2}}. After the German gunboat {{SMS|Geier}} was interned by the Americans on 8 November, the ex-Russian battleship [[Russian battleship Retvizan|''Hizen'']] and ''Asama'', which had been patrolling off [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, to prevent the German ship from leaving, rendezvoused with the other ships of the American Expeditionary Squadron at [[Magdalena Bay]], [[Baja California]] on 22 November. The squadron, now commanded by Rear Admiral [[Moriyama Keizaburo]] in ''Izumo'', then headed south to search along the western coast of South America for German ships. On 11 December, after the receiving the news of the British victory in the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]], the squadron moved north to search off the western coast of [[Central America]] and then Mexican and U.S. waters in January.&lt;ref name=estes&gt;Estes&lt;/ref&gt;

While searching Baja California, ''Asama'' was badly damaged when she struck an uncharted rock on 31 January. ''Izumo'', delayed by poor communications, arrived on 12 February and Moriyama radioed for [[repair ship|repair]] and [[salvage ship]]s to be sent from Japan. ''Izumo'' was relieved by ''Tokiwa'' on 19 March and the ship returned home.&lt;ref name=estes/&gt;

''Izumo'' relieved the protected cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Akashi||2}} in June 1917 at [[Malta]] as the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Kōzō Satō]], commander of the Second Special Mission Squadron that controlled the Japanese [[destroyer]]s that escorted convoys in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In December 1918, ''Izumo'', accompanied by the destroyers {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hinoki||2}} and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Yanagi||2}}, sailed from Malta to [[Scapa Flow]] to assume control of seven captured German [[U-boat]]s as [[prize of war|prizes of war]]. They returned to Malta with the U-boats in March 1919 and the armored cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Nisshin||2}} accompanied eight destroyers and the U-boats to Japan, while ''Izumo'' made port calls at [[Naples]], [[Genoa]] and [[Marseilles]] before arriving in Japan with the remaining destroyers on 2 July 1919.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

===Interwar years===
[[File:Japanese cruiser Izumo at Vancouver Feb 1925.jpg|thumb|''Izumo'' at anchor in Vancouver, 1925]]
''Izumo'' participated in the 1919 [[Naval Review]] by [[Emperor Taishō]]. She was re-designated a 1st class [[Kaibokan|coast-defense ship]] on 1 September 1921&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; and used primarily for training duties in long-distance oceanic navigation and officer training for cadets in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Academy]]. In this capacity, she participated six voyages in the 1920s and 1930s to [[Europe]], North and [[South America]], and [[Oceania]],&lt;ref&gt;Lacroix &amp; Wells, pp. 657, 659&lt;/ref&gt; including a circumnavigation of the globe from August 1921 to April 1922 with ''Yakumo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000329/19211129/053/0005|title=World Cruise|date=29 November 1921|work=Western Morning News|page=5|accessdate=11 April 2015| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the naval cadets that participated in this cruise were Princes [[Prince Kuni Asaakira|Kuni Asaakira]] and [[Prince Kachō Hirotada|Kachō Hirotada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9801E0DE103EEE3ABC4051DFB667838A639EDE|title=Japanese Cruisers Here With Cadets|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2015|date=28 October 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], on 7 February 1925, on one of these cruises, a [[tugboat]] collided with one of the ship's boats at night, drowning 11 crewmen.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

In 1924, four of ''Izumo''{{'}}s 12-pounder guns were removed, as were all of her QF 2.5-pounder guns, and a single [[8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun|8&amp;nbsp;cm/40 3rd Year Type]] [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) gun]] was added. Refitted again in 1930–31, her torpedo tubes were removed as were all of her main deck 6-inch guns and their casemates plated over; she now carried only four 12-pounders.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 her boilers were replaced by six [[Kampon]] [[water-tube boiler]]s with an output of only {{convert|7000|ihp|abbr=on}} which reduced her top speed to {{convert|16|kn}}. She now carried {{convert|1405|LT|t|disp=flip|sp=us}} of coal and {{convert|324|LT|t|disp=flip|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]] which increased her deep displacement to {{convert|10692|LT|t|disp=flip|sp=us}}&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

===China service and World War II===
[[File:ColorizedIzumo1932.jpg|thumb|''Izumo'' at anchor in the [[Huangpu River]], Shanghai, 1932. The armored cruiser {{USS|Rochester|CA-2|6}} is anchored to the left.]]
On 2 February 1932, during the [[January 28 Incident|First Shanghai Incident]], ''Izumo'' became the flagship of the newly re-established [[3rd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|3rd Fleet]] under Admiral [[Kichisaburō Nomura]]&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; and arrived in Shanghai six days later.&lt;ref&gt;Mauch, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, ''Izumo'' was equipped to operate a [[floatplane]] at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

Shortly after the beginning of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in July 1937, ''Izumo'' was attacked on 14 August 1937 in a series of raids by [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] aircraft during the [[Battle of Shanghai]]. Most of the bombs landed in the river without effect, but two bombs landed among spectators, killing hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;Harmsen, pp. 56–62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Izumo''{{'}}s [[Nakajima E4N]] floatplane and another from the light cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Sendai||2}} managed to get into the air and they claimed to have shot down one  [[Curtiss Hawk]] [[biplane]] fighter and a [[Northrop Gamma]] bomber. Two days later, her E4N claimed to have shot down another Hawk.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hata, Shores &amp; Izawa, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; ''Izumo'' was attacked that same day by a [[Republic of China Navy|Chinese]] torpedo boat, but the torpedoes missed and the boat was abandoned by its crew.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; The ship provided [[naval gunfire support]] to Japanese troops ashore during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/17393692?searchTerm=cruiser%20izumo&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=193|title=Japanese Consulate in Ruins|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Trove: Digitized newspapers and more|date=18 August 1937|page=15|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Izumo'' was repeatedly attacked without effect by Chinese aircraft for the duration of the Battle of Shanghai.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

[[File:Japanese cruiser Izumo in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|''Izumo'' in Shanghai, 1937]]
Still in [[Shanghai]] at the beginning of the Pacific War on 8 December 1941, ''Izumo'' captured the American [[river gunboat]] {{USS|Wake|PR-3|6}} and assisted in sinking the British river gunboat {{HMS|Peterel|1927|6}}.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December, the cruiser struck a mine in the [[Lingayen Gulf]] while supporting Japanese forces during the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–1942)|Philippines Campaign]]. She was towed to [[Hong Kong]] in February 1942 for repairs. ''Izumo'' was re-classified as a 1st-class cruiser on 1 July.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; She returned to Japan in late 1943 and was reclassified as a training ship&lt;ref name=f4&gt;Fukui, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Kure Naval District]].&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

On 19 March 1945, ''Izumo'' was attacked by American carrier aircraft off [[Etajima]], although they failed to inflict any damage. Shortly afterwards, her 8-inch guns were replaced by four [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun|{{convert|12.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} Type 89]] [[dual-purpose gun]]s in two twin mounts and four of her remaining 6-inch guns were removed. Her light anti-aircraft armament was significantly reinforced by the addition of 14 license-built [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-aircraft gun|Hotchkiss]] [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|25-millimeter Type 96]] light AA guns in two triple, two twin, and four single-gun mounts and two [[13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun|13.2-millimeter Hotchkiss machine gun]]s in single mounts.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;&lt;ref name=f4/&gt; The ship was damaged by an American mine on 9 April off [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; ''Izumo'' was not attacked on the first day of the American aerial [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|attack on Kure]] on 24 July 1945, but she was near missed three times four days later. The shockwave from the detonations sprang the ship's seams and the resulting flooding caused her to [[capsize]] at coordinates {{coord|34|14|N|132|30|E|}}. She was removed from the [[navy list]] on 20 November and her [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] was raised and scrapped in 1947 by the [[IHI Corporation|Harima Dock Company]].&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;
