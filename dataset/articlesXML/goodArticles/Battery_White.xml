'''Battery White''' was an [[artillery battery]] constructed by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] during the [[American Civil War]].  Built in 1862&amp;ndash;63 to defend [[Winyah Bay]] on the [[South Carolina]] coast, the battery was strongly situated and constructed; however, it was inadequately manned, and was captured without resistance during the final months of the war.

The battery is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  It is located on private land, but is open to the public.

==Island fortifications==

Even before the outbreak of the Civil War, the secessionist government of South Carolina was concerned with the possibility of attack by sea in [[Georgetown County, South Carolina|Georgetown County]].  Shortly after the December 20, 1860 passage of the [[Ordinance of Secession]],&lt;ref name=secession/&gt; an aide-de-camp to governor [[Francis Pickens]] urged [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] planters to &quot;aid in the erection of Batteries to protect and defend the entrance of Winyah Bay and the [[Santee River]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=alston/&gt;

The area offered a tempting target to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces.  Winyah Bay would furnish a sheltered anchorage large enough for the entire United States Navy of 1861.  The city of [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]] on the bay was the largest on the South Carolina coast north of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].&lt;ref name=simmons-11/&gt;  Georgetown County produced nearly half of the rice grown in the United States, amounting to some 54 million pounds ({{Convert|54000000|lb|t|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) in 1860; Georgetown exported more rice than any other port in the world.&lt;ref name=half-rice/&gt;&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;  This production and shipping could be disrupted by gunboats moving up the [[Black River (South Carolina)|Black]], the [[Pee Dee River|Pee Dee]], the [[Waccamaw River|Waccamaw]], and the [[Sampit River|Sampit]] rivers, which flow into the bay; and the two [[Distributary|distributary channels]] of the Santee River, whose mouths lie just below the bay.&lt;ref name=simmons-11/&gt;  Curtailing rice production would not only damage the local economy, but would impair the Confederacy's ability to feed its armies.&lt;ref name=simmons-46-47/&gt;

[[File:Battery White in Winyah Bay, SC map.svg|thumb|Winyah Bay, including locations of Battery White and sunken [[USS Harvest Moon (1863)|USS ''Harvest Moon'']]]]

In May 1861, General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] ordered the development of coastal defenses for South Carolina, including batteries situated on three islands flanking the mouth of Winyah Bay: North Island, South Island, and Cat Island.  The [[Battle of Port Royal|Federal capture of Port Royal]] in November 1861 lent urgency to the construction and improvement of these works, which was done under [[Robert E. Lee]], the newly appointed commander of the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and East Florida, with Colonel [[Arthur Middleton Manigault]] in charge of the district that included Georgetown and [[Horry County, South Carolina|Horry]] counties.&lt;ref name=simmons-13-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=lee-appt/&gt;

The island fortifications were never tested against a major Union attack.  However, they served a useful purpose in dealing with grounded ships, both Confederate and Federal; in protecting the entrance to the bay; and in maintaining Confederate possession of the islands.&lt;ref name=simmons-18/&gt;

[[File:John C. Pemberton(hh21b2).jpg|thumb|John C. Pemberton]]

==Withdrawal==

Matters changed in early 1862.  In March of that year, Lee was recalled to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] as military advisor to President [[Jefferson Davis]].&lt;ref name=lee-remove1/&gt;&lt;ref name=lee-remove2/&gt;  He was replaced by General [[John C. Pemberton]],&lt;ref name=pemberton/&gt; who ordered the withdrawal of troops and artillery from the positions around Georgetown, apparently in order to concentrate his limited manpower on shorter defensive lines.&lt;ref name=simmons-103-104/&gt;&lt;ref name=pemberton2/&gt;

Union naval forces were quick to take advantage of this new vulnerability.  In May 1862, the gunboats [[USS Albatross (1858)|USS ''Albatross'']] and [[USS Norwich (1861)|USS ''Norwich'']] noted that the island forts were unoccupied.  They landed troops to occupy North Island, which became the principal local Union base for much of the war; and they destroyed the fortifications on South and Cat Islands.&lt;ref name=simmons-19-25/&gt;&lt;ref name=albwich/&gt;  They also sailed some {{Convert|10|mi}} up the Waccamaw River, where they raided a mill and carried off 80 slaves.&lt;ref name=simmons-105-106/&gt;  Settled on North Island, these freed slaves formed the nucleus of a colony of &quot;[[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]]&quot; that grew to more than a thousand before being removed to Port Royal for fear of Confederate raids leading to their recapture or massacre.&lt;ref name=simmons-19-20/&gt;

The Federal forces made no attempt to seize territory up the rivers, and their expeditions were limited by the draft of their vessels.  Nevertheless, they conducted a number of raids in which they damaged facilities, seized rice, and released slaves; and these raids severely disrupted the region's economy.  Rice production in particular suffered, since it depended on a labor force of skilled slaves performing carefully timed tasks.&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;&lt;ref name=simmons-54-60/&gt;

Pemberton still refused to move artillery and men to the Georgetown area, maintaining that all of his resources were necessary for the protection of Charleston.&lt;ref name=pemberton-chesnut/&gt;  However, his superiors ordered him to construct new fortifications at Winyah Bay.  Since the Union now controlled the islands, it was necessary to find sites further up the bay.  On August 3, 1862, Pemberton visited the area and selected Mayrant's Bluff and Frazier's Point as the sites for the new batteries.&lt;ref name=simmons-56/&gt;

==Battery White==

Later in August 1862, Pemberton was promoted to lieutenant general and sent to the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, where he would eventually surrender [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]].  He was replaced in the Department of South Carolina and Georgia by Beauregard, who assumed command on September 24, 1862.&lt;ref name=pemberton/&gt;&lt;ref name=p-b-1/&gt;&lt;ref name=p-b-2/&gt;  The new commander supported the fortification of Winyah Bay: on October 8, 1862, he assured Governor Pickens that he had ordered the construction of a battery of five or six pieces of artillery at Mayrant's Bluff;&lt;ref name=beauregard-to-pickens/&gt; on November 10, he wrote Colonel [[James Chesnut, Jr.]] that the battery was &quot;armed and completed&quot;, and that he had sent a new regiment of the State Reserves to General [[James H. Trapier]], in command of the Georgetown District.&lt;ref name=beauregard-to-chesnut/&gt;

[[File:JHTrapierCSA.jpg|thumb|James H. Trapier]]

Trapier was less than pleased with the troops and artillery that he had been given.  The new regiment, he noted, arrived at the battery without arms and ammunition; and as Reserves, would only be in service for 90 days, not enough time to make effective soldiers of them even had they been armed.  He had also been given fairly light guns; what he wanted was [[Columbiad]]s, suitable for defending the battery and the bay against incursions by [[Ironclad warships|ironclads]].&lt;ref name=simmons-109-110/&gt;

Despite the paucity of men and weaponry, the new battery proved effective.  On November 11, 1862, two Union gunboats entered Winyah Bay and began firing on the Mayrant's Bluff works.  The Second South Carolina Artillery, which had set up nine guns in the fortification, responded; and within a few minutes, the Federal vessels were forced to retire.&lt;ref name=simmons-60/&gt;

In February 1863, Trapier reported that the Mayrant's Bluff fortification, now named Battery White, was occupied by only 53 men and nine guns.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;  Even this small force sufficed to stop Federal incursions up the rivers of Winyah Bay.  However, rice production in the Georgetown area did not recover: the raids had destroyed too much of the physical plant, carried off too many of the slaves, and created too much uncertainty for planters to return to anything near full production.&lt;ref name=simmons-60/&gt;

The battery continued to lose manpower, despite Trapier's ongoing calls for more troops and guns.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;  In October 1864, a body of eleven deserters from the Confederate German Artillery reached the gunboat [[USS Potomska (1861)|USS ''Potomska'']]; they reported that there was great discontent among the troops, and that many would desert were they not so strongly guarded.  They also reported that there were ten guns at the battery; the captain of the ''Potomska'' concluded that the bay was too well defended for him to render aid to prospective deserters.&lt;ref name=potomska/&gt;&lt;ref name=potomska2/&gt;

==Capture==

In November 1864, Trapier was ordered to bring most of his forces to [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina|Mount Pleasant]], just north of Charleston.  Only a company of the German Artillery was left to defend the Georgetown district.  By the end of January 1865, only a small crew commanded by a lieutenant remained at Battery White.&lt;ref name=simmons-116/&gt;

In January and early February 1865, Union forces under General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] moved northward from Georgia into South Carolina.  On February 2 and 3, they defeated a Confederate force in the [[Battle of Rivers' Bridge]], clearing their pathway into the state.  After a feint at Charleston, they marched to [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], which they entered on February 17; on the same day, Charleston was evacuated, and on the 18th, it was surrendered.&lt;ref name=sherman/&gt;&lt;ref name=charleston-surrender/&gt;

[[File:Battery White Columbiad 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Large cannon under trees hung with Spanish moss|Columbiad at Battery White]]

From Charleston, Union naval forces under Admiral [[John A. Dahlgren]] moved up the coast to Georgetown, which Dahlgren thought might be a useful point of communication with Sherman's land forces.&lt;ref name=dahlgren-report/&gt;  On February 23, deserters told the captain of the gunboat [[USS Mingoe (1863)|USS ''Mingoe'']] that Battery White had been or would soon be evacuated.  The ''Mingoe'' fired four rounds into the battery.  When no response was made, a party was sent ashore; they found the battery abandoned and its guns [[Touch hole#Spiking the guns|spiked]].&lt;ref name=mingoe-report/&gt;&lt;ref name=mingoe2/&gt;  The [[sloop-of-war]] [[USS Pawnee (1859)|USS ''Pawnee'']] and the gunboat [[USS Nipsic|USS ''Nipsic'']] continued up the bay and landed a party of Marines to take possession of Georgetown;&lt;ref name=dahlgren-report/&gt;&lt;ref name=nipnee/&gt; the [[Intendant#United States|intendant and wardens]] of the city formally surrendered it on February 25.&lt;ref name=intendant/&gt;

Soon thereafter, Dahlgren inspected the battery, and was impressed.  The fortification, he wrote, was well situated and designed, laid out to defend against both shipborne bombardment and attack by landing parties.  Eleven guns bore on the channel: two {{convert|10|in|adj=on|0}} Columbiads, three banded [[rifled]] 32-pounders, four [[smoothbore]] 24-pounders, and two banded rifled 12-pounders.  A 6-pound smoothbore flanked the ditch.  The rear was defended by a &quot;formidable&quot; rampart and ditch, with a 24-pound smoothbore at either end; in the fort were numerous traverses and magazines.  The approach along the beach to the battery's right flank was covered by a 24-pound and a 12-pound smoothbore.  &quot;If the works had been sufficiently manned&quot;, wrote Dahlgren, &quot;it would have required good troops to take the work.&quot;&lt;ref name=dahlgren-report2/&gt;

===Sinking of the USS ''Harvest Moon''===

By the fall of 1864, the Union fleet had effectively closed Winyah Bay to blockade runners.  Accordingly, the Confederate command had elected to lay [[Naval mine|mines]], at the time known as &quot;torpedoes&quot;, in the bay.  Eighteen mines had been constructed in Georgetown by Captain Thomas West Daggett and Stephen W. Rouquie and placed strategically in the bay.&lt;ref name=simmons-146-148/&gt;&lt;ref name=daggett/&gt;&lt;ref name=rouquie/&gt;

As early as January 1865, Union sympathizers in Georgetown had warned Dahlgren's forces about the existence of mines in the channel.&lt;ref name=simmons-148/&gt;  While approaching Battery White, the ''Mingoe'' had sent its boats out to sweep for such devices.&lt;ref name=mingoe-report/&gt;  However, their efforts may have been perfunctory: according to Dahlgren's report, &quot;...so much has been said in ridicule of torpedoes that very little precautions are deemed necessary, and if resorted to are probably taken with less care than if due weight was attached to the existence of these mischievous things.&quot;&lt;ref name=dahlgren-report3/&gt;

On the morning of March 1, 1865, Dahlgren's flagship, the side-wheel [[steamboat|steamer]] [[USS Harvest Moon (1863)|USS ''Harvest Moon'']], sailed from Georgetown toward Battery White, which Dahlgren intended to inspect.  En route, the vessel struck one of Daggett and Rouquie's mines, which blew a large hole in it, killing one sailor; the boat quickly sank in two and a half [[fathom]]s of water.&lt;ref name=simmons-148/&gt;&lt;ref name=dahlgren-report3/&gt;&lt;ref name=moon/&gt;

==Battery White postbellum==

For over a century after the Civil War, the grounds on which Battery White stood were part of the Belle Isle Plantation.  During the late 19th century, extensive landscaping was undertaken on the plantation.  The [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] erected a memorial stone on the site in 1929.  In about 1946, the plantation gardens, including the battery, were opened to the public, and remained thus until 1974.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;&lt;ref name=udc/&gt;

In the 1970s, the plantation was developed as a condominium complex.  Portions of the {{convert|100|acre|adj=on}} complex of fortifications were lost to construction.  However, the owners elected to preserve Battery White itself.  In 1977, a {{convert|3|acre|adj=on}} area encompassing the battery was nominated to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;  In 2008, the site was re-opened to the public.&lt;ref name=open2008/&gt;

The battery's earthworks are for the most part well preserved.  The powder magazines have deteriorated, owing to collapse of the earth mounds following decay of their wooden interior shoring.  The two Columbiads have been re-mounted and once again point out over Winyah Bay.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

[[File:USS Harvest Moon 53685.jpg|thumb|alt=Remains of metal cylinder, 4-6 feet in diameter, protrude from water; three divers in foreground|U.S. Navy divers survey the ''Harvest Moon'', 1963]]

Three of the battery's guns have been placed in Georgetown.  A 24-pound gun has been mounted in front of the National Guard Armory,&lt;ref name=natguard/&gt; and two cannon are displayed in Constitution Park on the Georgetown waterfront.&lt;ref name=conpark/&gt;

The ''Harvest Moon'' was never salvaged, and has gradually sunk deeper into the mud of the bay.  In the mid-1960s, the top deck lay under an estimated six feet ({{Convert|6|ft|disp=output only}}) of mud.&lt;ref name=simmons-150-151/&gt;  A Georgetown group attempted to salvage and restore the vessel as a tourist attraction, and in 1964 the U.S. Navy formally abandoned it, rendering it eligible for private salvage; but the attempt failed for lack of funds.&lt;ref name=salvage/&gt;  As of 2011, the ship's boiler stack was still visible at low tide.&lt;ref name=stack/&gt;
