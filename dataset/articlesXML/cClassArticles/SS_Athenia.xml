'''SS ''Athenia''''' was a steam turbine [[Transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] passenger liner built in Glasgow in 1923 for the Anchor-Donaldson Line, which later became the Donaldson Atlantic Line. She worked between the [[United Kingdom]] and the east coast of [[Canada]] until September 1939, when a [[torpedo]] from a [[Germany|German]] [[submarine]] sank her in the [[Western Approaches]]. There were 117 fatalities.

''Athenia'' was the first [[United Kingdom|UK]] ship to be sunk by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] during [[World War II]], and the incident accounted for the Donaldson Line's greatest single loss of life at sea. 128 civilian passengers and crew were killed with the sinking condemned as a [[war crime]]. The dead included 28 [[United States|US]] citizens, leading Germany to fear that the USA might react by joining the war on the side of the UK and [[France]]. German authorities denied that one of their vessels had sunk the ship, and the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' did not admit responsibility until January 1946.

==Construction==
The [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] of [[Govan]] in Glasgow built ''Athenia'', launching her on 28 January 1922 and completing her in 1923. She measured {{GRT|13465}} and {{NRT|8118}}, was  {{convert|526.3|ft|abbr=on}} long [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]] by {{convert|66.4|ft|abbr=on}} [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] and had a [[Hull (watercraft)#Metrics|depth]] of {{convert|38.1|ft|abbr=on}}. She had six [[Steam turbine#Marine propulsion|steam turbines]] driving twin [[Propeller|screws]] ''via'' double reduction gearing, giving her a speed of {{convert|15|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=LR30&gt;{{cite book

==Career==
''Athenia'' was built for Anchor-Donaldson Line, which was a joint venture between [[Anchor Line (steamship company)|Anchor Line]] and Donaldson Line. Fairfield built a [[sister ship]], {{SS|Letitia||2}}, which was launched in October 1924 and was completed in 1925. ''Athenia'' and ''Letitia'' were the two largest ships in Donaldson's various fleets. The ships worked Anchor-Donaldson's trans-Atlantic route linking [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool]] and [[Glasgow]] with [[Port of Quebec|Quebec]] and [[Port of Montreal|Montreal]] in summer and to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] in winter. After the construction of the [[Pier 21]] immigration complex in Halifax in 1928, ''Athenia'' became a more frequent caller at Halifax, making over 100 trips to Halifax with immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some winter months when there was less trans-Atlantic passenger traffic, ''Athenia'' switched to cruising.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 1935 Anchor Line went into liquidation and Donaldson Line bought most of its assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 1 September 1939 ''Athenia'', commanded by [[Sea captain|Captain]] James Cook, left Glasgow for Montreal ''via'' Liverpool and [[Belfast]]. She carried 1,103 passengers including about 500 Jewish refugees, 469 Canadians, 311 US citizens and 72 UK subjects, and 315 crew.&lt;ref name=Johnmeyer&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite clear indications that war would break out any day, she departed Liverpool at 13:00 hrs on 2 September without recall, and on the evening of the 3rd was {{convert|60|nmi|km}} south of [[Rockall]] and {{convert|200|nmi|km}} northwest of [[Inishtrahull]], Ireland, when she was sighted by the {{GS|U-30|1936|6}} commanded by ''[[Oberleutnant zur See|Oberleutnant]]'' [[Fritz-Julius Lemp]] around 16:30. Lemp later claimed that the fact that she was a darkened ship steering a zigzag course which seemed to be well off the normal shipping routes made him believe she was either a [[troopship]], a [[Q-ship]] or an [[Armed merchantman#Armed merchant cruisers|armed merchant cruiser]]. ''U-30'' tracked the ''Athenia'' for three hours until eventually, at 19:40, when both vessels were between Rockall and [[Tory Island]], Lemp ordered two torpedoes to be fired. The first exploded on ''Athenia''{{'}}s port side in her engine room, and she began to settle by the stern.

Several ships, including the {{sclass2-|E|destroyer}} {{HMS|Electra|H27|6}}, responded to ''Athenia''{{'}}s [[distress signal]]. ''Electra''{{'}}s commander, Lt. Cdr. Sammy A. Buss, was Senior Officer Present and took charge. He sent the [[E and F class destroyer|F-class]] [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Fame|H78|6}} on an anti-submarine sweep of the area, while ''Electra'', another E-class destroyer, {{HMS|Escort|H66|6}}, the Swedish [[yacht]] ''[[Rover (yacht)|Southern Cross]]'', the {{GRT|5749}} Norwegian [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] MS ''Knute Nelson'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The German liner {{SS|Bremen|1929|6}}, ''en route'' from New York to [[Murmansk]], also received ''Athenia''{{'}}s distress signal, but ignored it.{{sfn|Brennecke|2003|pp=15–16}} ''City of Flint'' took 223 survivors to [[Pier 21]] at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] and ''Knute Nelson'' landed 450 at [[Galway]].

No. 5A lifeboat came alongside the empty tanker and tied up, against advice, astern of No 12 lifeboat.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Only {{convert|15|ft|0}} separated the life boat from the tanker's exposed propeller. Once No. 12 lifeboat was emptied it was cast adrift and began to sink. This fact was reported to the bridge of ''Knute Nelson''. For some reason the ship's [[engine order telegraph]] was then set to full ahead. 5A lifeboat's mooring line or &quot;warp&quot; parted under the stress, causing the lifeboat to be pulled back into the revolving propeller.

There was a second accident at about 05:00 hrs when No. 8 lifeboat capsized in a heavy sea below the stern of the yacht ''Southern Cross'', killing 10 people. Three passengers were crushed to death while trying to transfer from lifeboats to the [[Royal Navy]] destroyers. Other deaths were due to falling overboard from ''Athenia'' and her lifeboats, or to injuries and exposure.  Ultimately, all deaths were the result of the U-boat violating orders and torpedoing a merchant passenger liner.

54 dead were Canadian and 28 were US citizens, which led to German fears that the incident would bring the US into the war.&lt;ref name=Johnmeyer/&gt;

It was not until the Nuremberg Trials after the War that the truth of the U-Boat sinking of the SS Athenia finally came out.  The sinking was given dramatic publicity throughout the English-speaking world.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=17}} The front pages of many newspapers ran photographs of the lost ship along with headlines about the UK's declaration of war. For example, the ''[[Halifax Herald]]'' for 4 September 1939 had a banner across its front page announcing &quot;LINER ATHENIA IS TORPEDOED AND SUNK&quot; with, in the center of the page, &quot;EMPIRE AT WAR&quot; in outsized red print.

A Canadian girl, 10-year-old Margaret Hayworth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url       = http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=3167585 
|title     = Hayworth, Margaret Janet 
|publisher = Commonwealth War Graves Commission
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was among the casualties, and was one of the first Canadians to be killed by enemy action. Newspapers widely publicised the story, proclaiming &quot;Ten-Year-Old Victim of Torpedo&quot; as &quot;Canadians Rallying Point&quot;, and set the tone for their coverage of the rest of the war. One thousand people met the train that brought her body back to [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and there was a public funeral attended by the mayor of Hamilton, the city council, the Lieutenant-Governor, [[Albert Edward Matthews]], Premier [[Mitchell Hepburn]], and the entire Ontario cabinet.{{sfn|Houghton|2003|pp=75–76}}

When [[Erich Raeder|Grand Admiral Raeder]] first heard of the sinking of the ''Athenia'', he made inquiries and was told that no U-boat was nearer than {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} to the location of the sinking. He therefore told the US chargé d'affaires in good faith that the German Navy had not been responsible. When, on 27 September, ''U-30'' returned to Wilhelmshaven, Lemp reported to [[Karl Dönitz|Admiral Dönitz]] that he had sunk the ''Athenia'' in error. Dönitz at once sent Lemp to Berlin, where he explained the incident to Raeder. In turn, Raeder reported to Hitler, who decided that the incident should be kept secret for political reasons. Raeder decided against court-martialling Lemp because he considered that he had made an understandable mistake, and the log of the ''U-30'', which was seen by many people, was altered to sustain the official denials.

A month later the ''[[Voelkischer Beobachter]]'', the Nazi party's official newspaper, published an article which blamed the loss of the ''Athenia'' on the UK, accusing [[Winston Churchill]], then First Lord of the Admiralty, of sinking the ship to turn neutral opinion against [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Raeder claimed not to have known about this previous to publication and said that if he had known about it, he would have prevented its appearing.{{sfn|Davidson|1997|p=381}}

In the US, 60 per cent of respondents to a [[Gallup poll]] believed the Germans were responsible, despite their initial claims that the ''Athenia'' had been sunk by the UK for propaganda purposes, with only 9 per cent believing otherwise. Some anti-interventionists called for restraint while at the same time expressing their abhorrence of the sinking. [[Boake Carter]] described it as a criminal act.

Some were not completely convinced that Germany was in fact responsible. [[Herbert Hoover]] expressed his doubts, saying, &quot;It is such poor tactics that I cannot believe that even the clumsy Germans would do such a thing&quot;, while [[North Carolina]] senator [[Robert Rice Reynolds]] denied that Germany had any motive to sink the ''Athenia''. At best, he said, such an action &quot;could only further inflame the world, and particularly America, against Germany, with no appreciable profits from the sinking.&quot; He added that Britain could have had a motive – &quot;to infuriate the American people&quot;.{{sfn|Doenecke|2003|p=68}}

It was not until January 1946, during the case against Admiral Raeder at the [[Nuremberg trials]], that a statement by Admiral Dönitz was read in which he finally admitted that ''Athenia'' had been torpedoed by ''U-30'' and that every effort had been made to cover it up. Lemp, who claimed he had mistaken her for an armed merchant cruiser, took the first steps to conceal the facts by omitting to make an entry in the submarine's log, and swearing his crew to secrecy.

After ''Athenia''{{'}}s sinking, [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] were circulated by pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] and anti-British circles. For example, one editor in Boston's ''Italian News'' suggested the ship had been sunk by British mines and blamed on German U-boats to draw America into the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|ref       = harv
}} (weekly column)&lt;/ref&gt; The claims were unfounded.

===Legality of sinking===
{{unsourced|section|date=November 2016}}
As ''Athenia'' was an unarmed passenger ship, the attack violated the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague conventions]] and the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930 that allowed all warships including submarines to stop and search merchant vessels, but forbade capture as prize or sinking unless the ship was carrying contraband or engaged in military activity. Even if this was the case, and if it was decided to sink their ship, it was required that passengers and crew must be transferred to a &quot;place of safety&quot; as a priority. Although Germany had not signed the 1930 treaty, the German 1936 Prize Rules (''Prisenordnung'') binding their naval commanders copied most of its restrictions. Lemp of ''U-30'' did none of these things, choosing instead to fire without warning.

==Memorials==
The lost British members of ''Athenia's'' crew are commemorated at the [[Tower Hill Memorial]] in London. Canadian crew who died are listed at the Halifax Memorial (Sailor's Memorial) at [[Point Pleasant Park]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
No movie has been made of the full story of the sinking, but the film ''[[Arise, My Love]]'' (1940), directed by [[Mitchell Leisen]] and starring [[Claudette Colbert]] and [[Ray Milland]], had a sequence involving the torpedoing of the liner.

The song ''Rollerskate Skinny'', written by [[Rhett Miller]] and performed by his band [[The Old 97's]], mentions Athenia{{'}}s sinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url   = http://www.metrolyrics.com/rollerskate-skinny-lyrics-old-97s.html
|title = Rollerskate Skinny Lyrics
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[John Dickson Carr]]'s novel ''[[The Man Who Could Not Shudder]]'', Dr Fell announces the end of story by showing his audience a newspaper bearing headline &quot;LINER ATHENIA: FULL LIST OF VICTIMS&quot;. He means to say that the [[Second World War]] has begun and the truth of the mystery is now unlikely to surface.

The sinking of the SS ''Athenia'' is also mentioned in [[Alyson Richman]]'s novel ''[[The Lost Wife]]'' about pre-war Prague and how the dreams of two young lovers are shattered when they are separated by the Nazi invasion, their endurance and experiences during WWII and the Holocaust only to find one another again decades later in the United States.

Recent extensive research concerning the incident appears in Cay Rademacher's 2009 book ''Drei Tage im September – die letzte Fahrt der Athenia, 1939'' published by MareVerlag of Hamburg.

In the novel by Norman Collins, &quot;London Belongs to Me&quot;, he describes the sinking of the SS &quot;Anthenia&quot; as war breaks out across Europe.  As a result of the sinking, Londoners are in no doubt war has started, and start bracing themselves for what's to come.
