== Endurance ==

As far as I can recollect, Home Guard personell are expected to, along with their combat baggage, pack food for three days. Thus the expected endurance of a home guard soldier would be three days, until re-supply is needed (in regards to nutrition, don't know about ammo). I am trying to find a citable source of this fact. --[[User:217.209.220.222|217.209.220.222]] 18:51, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

== The Name ==
According to hemvarnet.se the official english name for ''hemvärnet'' is '''The Swedish National Home Guard'''. Should the word 'National' be added to the title? It would make sense since it connects to the name ''Nationella Skydsstyrkorna''. [[Special:Contributions/130.237.216.122|130.237.216.122]] ([[User talk:130.237.216.122|talk]]) 07:03, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

== Comparison with American State Defence Forces ==
Why compare the Swedish Home Guards to the American State Defence Forces. The latter are almost unknown, even in America.[[User:JohnC|JohnC]] ([[User talk:JohnC|talk]]) 07:03, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

:I also dont understand why the comparison is there? The Swedish National Home Guard is so much different it shouldnt be compared it should just be explained what it is.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/212.247.227.250|212.247.227.250]] ([[User talk:212.247.227.250|talk]]) 11:28, 20 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::I'm removing the comparison, since the article is neither a comparison between the two nor is it an accurate comparison. [[User:Xertoz|Xertoz]] ([[User talk:Xertoz|talk]]) 20:44, 31 October 2010 (UTC)

== Home Guard (Swedish Armed Forces) ==
Why was this article moved to ''Home Guard (Swedish Armed Forces)'' when all of the rest of the Home Guard Forces are standardized as &quot;Home Guard (Country)&quot; like this article was? I would like to see it moved back to Home Guard (Sweden) to see it brought back in line with those articles.--[[User:Degen Earthfast|Degen Earthfast]] ([[User talk:Degen Earthfast|talk]]) 16:51, 21 March 2015 (UTC)
: I moved this article back to Home Guard (Sweden) to harmonize with all the other Home Guard and military branch articles.--[[User:Degen Earthfast|Degen Earthfast]] ([[User talk:Degen Earthfast|talk]]) 01:43, 28 March 2015 (UTC)

== Confusion between origins and proportion of military ==

This sentence is confusing and confused: &quot;While originally composed of former militia groups, today it comprises half of the Swedish Army, thus constituting the basis of the military defence force of Sweden.&quot; The origins of the home guard, and the proportion of the modern military which it makes up, are two different and unrelated matters, and should not be in the same sentence.[[User:Royalcourtier|Royalcourtier]] ([[User talk:Royalcourtier|talk]]) 05:20, 4 May 2015 (UTC)

== Structure of the Swedish Armed Forces in 1989 ==

I created the article [[Structure of the Swedish Armed Forces in 1989]], which contains a complete overview of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] in 1989. The information comes from Arméhandboks of the army, from the Swedish wiki, and from government defense bills. As far as I can tell army and air force are complete and 100% correct. As for the navy: all in 1989 commissioned ships are listed, but some flotillas and divisions are missing. The coastal artillery is nearly complete, although there are some of the Spärrbataljon and Rörliga Spärrbataljon missing. Also missing for all three services are some of the schools. The Home Guard is missing as I could not find info on the ~85 battalions the Home Guard would field. Also missing are the designations/numbers/locations of the independent artillery, engineer, signal, air defense, etc. battalions that would be activated in war (except for the 3x [[Bandkanon 1]] battalions of [[Milo ÖN]]). Even though these parts are missing, this is the '''''most comprehensive/detailed/full''''' listing of Swedish forces in 1989 ever.

However: if you have some more information, especially about the above mentioned stuff that is missing, please feel free to add this information to the article, or leave a message with the info on [[User talk:Noclador|my talk page]]. Thank you, [[User:Noclador|noclador]] ([[User talk:Noclador|talk]]) 17:39, 11 October 2016 (UTC)</text>
