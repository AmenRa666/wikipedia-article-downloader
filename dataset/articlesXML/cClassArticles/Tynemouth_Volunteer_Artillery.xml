The '''Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery''' claims to be the oldest volunteer [[artillery]] unit of the [[British Army]].&lt;ref name = History&gt;http://www.tvaa.org.uk/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://northumbriangunner.blogspot.co.uk/p/volunteer-artillery.html&lt;/ref&gt; It served coastal, siege and anti-aircraft guns in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and also served in the infantry role.

==Artillery Volunteers 1859-1908==
The first artillery unit formed amid the enthusiasm that created the British [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] in the mid-19th Century was the '''1st Northumberland Artillery Volunteer Corps''', which was raised after a public meeting at [[Tynemouth]] on 7 May 1859. The meeting was held in response to statements by Commander [[Bedford Clapperton Trevelyan Pim|Bedford Pim]], Royal Navy, that a modern ironclad warship could do untold damage to the towns of Tyneside due to the poor state of their defences. By 25 May 1859, the first drill was held for Rifle and Artillery volunteers at Tynemouth, and formal enrolment for the 1st Northumberland Artillery Volunteers opened on 2 August.&lt;ref name = History/&gt;&lt;ref name = Beckett&gt;Beckett, Appendix VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1859, the new unit held its first gun practice, on two 70-year-old muzzle-loading smoothbore cannon at [[Tynemouth Castle and Priory|Tynemouth Castle]]. Over the following years, the unit expanded with additional batteries. When county volunteer units were consolidated under the [[Childers Reforms]] of 1881, the 1st Northumberland AV was threatened with losing seniority to a later-formed unit in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], but after protests it was restored to primacy, with the title '''Tynemouth Artillery Volunteer Corps'''.&lt;ref name = History/&gt;&lt;ref name = Beckett/&gt;

In the early years, the volunteer gunners practised on whatever guns were available, including those at Tynemouth Castle, until they were supplied with light 9-pounder field guns in 1869. At that time, the policy was for the Artillery Volunteers to support the Rifle Volunteers in the field. They were re-equipped with [[RBL 20 pounder Armstrong gun|20-pounder]] field and [[RBL 40 pounder Armstrong gun|40-pounder]] fort guns in 1889. In 1893, the batteries at Tynemouth Castle were equipped with modern 6-inch breechloading guns on hydro-pneumatic [[Disappearing gun|disappearing carriages]], and the Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery immediately began training to operate them, beginning their long association with coastal artillery. When the [[Territorial Force]] was created in 1908, the unit was affiliated to the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]], which was responsible for all coastal and fortress artillery.&lt;ref name = History/&gt;

==First World War==
On the outbreak of war, the Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery deployed to their war stations guarding the major ports of North East England under No 18 Coastal Fire Command.&lt;ref name = History/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1914-1918.net/artillery_home.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.warpath.orbat.com/artillery/rga_btys_tf.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.warpath.orbat.com/misc_units/coast_def.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Their headquarters were located at North Shields and their companies located as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Rinaldi, Richard A, 2008. Order of Battle of the British Army 1914, Ravi Rikhye, p276&lt;/ref&gt;

* No1 Company at North Shields
* No2 Company at North Shields
* No3 Company at Seaton Delaval
* No4 Company at Blyth

The Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery also provided personnel for '''44th Siege Battery''', Royal Garrison Artillery, which landed in France on 24 January 1916 and served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref name = History/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1914-1918.net/siege-battery-index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar years==
After the war, the unit was retitled the Tynemouth Coast Brigade RGA in the reformed [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], becoming the Tynemouth Heavy Brigade in 1924 when the RGA merged with the rest of the Royal Artillery (RA).&lt;ref name = History/&gt;&lt;ref name = Heavy&gt;http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/hvy/page26.html&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the regiment comprised two batteries, 151st and 152nd Heavy Batteries, with HQ and 151 Battery at [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]].&lt;ref name = List&gt;''Monthly Army List'' January 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the Tynemouth Volunteers also provided the men to form the new '''64th (Northumbrian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade''', RA (TA), consisting of the 179th and 180th (Tynemouth) AA batteries at [[North Shields]] and [[Seaton Delaval]] respectively. They were joined by 268th (Durham) AA Battery based at [[Consett]] and 269th AA Battery based at [[Seaham Harbour]]. The 64th was assigned to [[30th (Northumbrian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade|30th (Northumbrian) AA Group]] in [[2nd Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|2nd AA Division]].&lt;ref name = History/&gt;&lt;ref name = List/&gt;&lt;ref name = MilHist&gt;http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/2-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1936-38-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

(RA Brigades were redesignated Regiments in 1938, allowing AA Groups to adopt the more usual formation title of Brigades.)

==World War II==

===64th HAA Regiment===
[[File:The British Army in the Adriatic 1944 NA18246.jpg|250px|right|thumb|3.7-inch guns of 64th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment on the island of Vis off the coast of Yugoslavia, August 1944.]]
On the outbreak of World War II, 64th was still serving in the 30th (Northumbrian) Group covering Tyneside during [[The Blitz]].&lt;ref name = MilHist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patriotfiles.com/index.php?name=Sections&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=6697&amp;page=&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 64HAA&gt;http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page27.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1940, along with other AA units equipped with the older [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] and newer [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch]] AA guns, the 64th was designated a Heavy AA Regiment.&lt;ref name = Litchfield_54_57&gt;Litchfield pp 54â€“7.&lt;/ref&gt; It continued serving with Home Forces until May 1943, when it sailed to North Africa, joining Allied Forces HQ in July that year. It was assigned to [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] for the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]]. In February 1945, the regiment moved to join [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] in North West Europe, where it saw out the rest of the war.&lt;ref name = MilHist/&gt;&lt;ref name = 64HAA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, pp. 463, 465, 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coastal Artillery===
The Tynemouth Heavy Regiment split into three regiments of Coast Artillery in July 1940:&lt;ref name = History/&gt;&lt;ref name = Heavy/&gt;

* '''508 (Tynemouth) Coast Regiment''', RA (TA), stationed at [[Tynemouth]]&lt;ref name = 508RA&gt;http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/coast/page25.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Stations&gt;http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/home/page61.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''509 (Tynemouth) Coast Regiment''', RA (TA), stationed at [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]&lt;ref name = Stations/&gt;&lt;ref name = 509RA&gt;http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/coast/page26.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''510 (Tynemouth) Coast Regiment''', RA (TA), stationed at Blyth&lt;ref name = Stations/&gt;&lt;ref name = 510RA&gt;http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/coast/page27.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===616 Infantry Regiment===
As the war progressed, and the German threat receded, the need for coastal defence artillery diminished and the regiments were wound down. 509 Regiment was placed in suspended animation in April 1944;&lt;ref name = 509RA/&gt; and 510 Regiment followed in November 1944.&lt;ref name = 510RA/&gt; Then, in January 1945, the [[War Office]] began to reorganise surplus anti-aircraft and coastal artillery regiments in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties in North West Europe, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, pp. 369, 380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/infidx/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, the Regimental HQ of 509 Regiment became '''616 Infantry Regiment RA (TA)''' in [[301st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|301st Infantry Brigade]].&lt;ref name = 508RA/&gt;&lt;ref name = 616RA&gt;http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/infidx/page2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After infantry training in Scotland, the regiment transferred to [[21st Army Group]] on 9 May 1945, and landed on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]] on 15 May (a week after [[VE Day]]), where it came under the command of [[First Canadian Army]].&lt;ref name = 616RA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==
In 1947, 508 and 509 Regiments reformed in the postwar TA as '''404''' and '''405 (Tynemouth) Coast Regiments''' based at North Shields and Blyth respectively.&lt;ref name = Litchfield_192_193&gt;Litchfield, pp. 192â€“3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://northumbriangunner.blogspot.co.uk/p/1947-1967_10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, 64 HAA Regiment was retitled '''464 (Northumbrian) HAA Regiment'''. During the 1950s, all three regiments were amalgamated and then merged with 324 HAA Regiment, to form '''324 (Northumbrian) HAA Regiment''', RA (TA). In the 1967 TA reorganisation, the regiment became the Headquarters Battery of the amalgamated [[101st (Northumbrian) Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers)|101 (Northumberland) Regiment]] RA (V), the battery regaining its subtitle 'Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery' in 1993. In July 2006, the battery was disbanded, but the name was perpetuated in the Radar (Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery) Troop, of 204 Battery, RA (V).&lt;ref name = History/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20060117174950/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/ra101.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
