The '''26th Information Operations Wing''' is an inactive [[United States Air Force]] unit. Its last assignment was with [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] at [[Ramstein Air Base]], Germany, where it was inactivated on 5 July 2006.

The wing was first established during [[World War II]] as the '''5th Photographic Group''' with [[Twelfth Air Force|Twelfth]] and [[Fifteenth Air Force]]s in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of Operations]].

The '''26th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing''' operated under the direction of [[Strategic Air Command]] from 1952 until 1958.  The two units were consolidated in 1965 as the '''26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing''' and served for the next twenty-six years with [[United States Air Forces Europe]].  The [[wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] was inactivated on 31 July 1991.

The wing was activated again as the '''26th Intelligence Wing''' in late 1991.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:F-5E Lightning 1944.jpg|thumb|left|F-5E Lightning]]
The wing's first predecessor was activated in July 1942 as the '''5th Photographic Group''' at what would become [[Peterson Field]], Colorado with the [[921st Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron|21st]],  [[622d Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron|22d]], [[318th Operations Support Squadron|23d]] and [[24th Photographic Mapping Squadron]]s assigned, although neither the group nor any of its squadrons would become operational until January 1943.&lt;ref name=Ravenstein26TRW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer5RG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer21PRS&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer22PRS&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer23PRS&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 123-134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer24CMS&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the time the [[group (military aviation unit)|group]] moved overseas in August 1943, only the 23d and 24th Squadrons remained assigned.&lt;ref name=Maurer5RG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer23PRS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer24CMS/&gt;

After training in the United States and participating in [[military exercise]]s, the group moved to Tunisia and served in combat with [[Twelfth Air Force|Twelfth]] and [[Fifteenth Air Force]]s in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]].  The unit operated primarily with [[Lockheed F-5 Lightning]]s, ranging as far as Germany and Poland.  It also flew night photographic missions with its [[Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress]] and [[North American B-25D Mitchell]] aircraft.  The 5th Group provided photographic coverage for landing areas for [[Operation Shingle]], the Allied landings at Anzio.&lt;ref name=Maurer5RG/&gt;

The unit provided road and rail target reconnaissance for the [[United States Fifth Army]] and [[British Eighth Army]] and performed [[bomb damage assessment]] photography to measure the success of allied bombing.  It flew missions to northwestern France to photograph rail targets to be attacked in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]], the [[invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944.  Closer to home, it performed similar missions for [[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of southern France in August.  The group earned a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] in September when it secured intelligence of [[Luftwaffe]] installations in the Balkans that enabled [[fighter aircraft]] to destroy large numbers of Luftwaffe fighters and transports.&lt;ref name=Maurer5RG/&gt;

The group remained in Italy after [[VE Day]] until October 1945, when it returned to the United States and was inactivated on arrival at the Port of Embarkation.&lt;ref name=Maurer5RG/&gt;

===Strategic Air Command===
[[File:52-2135 B47 PIMA (11653133596).jpg|thumb|B-47E from Lockbourne AFB at Pima Air Museum]]
In May 1952 the '''26th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing''' was activated under [[Strategic Air Command]] as one of two [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] wings at  [[Lockbourne Air Force Base]], Ohio, but was not fully manned until January 1953.  The wing performed strategic reconnaissance and [[air refueling]] missions.  The wing became non-operational in April 1958 and was inactivated in July.&lt;ref name=Ravenstein26TRW/&gt;

===Tactical Reconnaissance in Europe===
The 5th Group and 26th Wing were consolidated in 1965 as the '''26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing''' and served for the next twenty-six years with [[United States Air Forces Europe]].  Exercising control of a deployed [[Aerospace Defense Command]] squadron, it also performed [[electronic countermeasure]] training through the late 1960s.  From 1968 to 1973, it added an [[air defense]] responsibility.  It performed day and night visual and photographic reconnaissance.  From the fall of 1972 to spring of 1973 the wing also had a [[special operations]] mission.&lt;ref name=Ravenstein26TRW/&gt;

With the end of the Cold War in 1990, the [[wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] was gradually phased down. In addition, the 1960s-era [[McDonnell RF-4C Phantom]]s were increasingly costing more and more to maintain. Tactical reconnaissance was being handled by other means, and the need for the wing was becoming less critical to USAFE planners. As a result, the RF-4Cs of the wing were sent to [[AMARC]] on 1 April 1991 and the wing's remaining tactical squadron was inactivated. The wing was inactivated on 31 July 1991.

===Intelligence operations===
The 26th Intelligence Wing was activated in October.   It was renamed the '''26th Information Operations Wing''' in 2000 and inactivated in 2006.
