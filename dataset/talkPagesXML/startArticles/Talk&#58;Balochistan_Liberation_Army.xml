==Comment==
It is a terrorist organization in UK and many other countries.

Also the flag of Balochistan. last time i visited ne site containing flag of Balochistan I think there was a five sided star in the blue portion instead of the sun. Can any one check it out. And there are also many gramatical mistakes in the article. [[User:OmerKhetran|OmerKhetran]] 14:26, 25 February 2007 (UTC)


baluchistan is the fourth and the largest province of pakistan.  this is a terrorist organization that takes its root from the extortion by the bugti, mari and mengal sardars, who, while being cruel feudal landlords, claim republican ideology.  they kill with impunity and rule like medieval lords, over life and limb of their subjects.  once the extortion by these sardras was disallowed, they started this terrorist campaign against their own people, on the lines that taliban of pakistan perpetrated on the people of khyber pakhtoonkhwa province.  these sardars have not allowed schools, colleges and are against allowing women out without purdah, not for religious reasons but for feudal oppression.  they bury women alive if accused of immodesty and suspicions of liking someone other than allowed by their sardars; there was a case of four young women buried alive when they were accused of flirting with some men in the village; they have not allowed any development in the province as they mobilize their 'troops' against any such moves.  BLA is now playing in the hands of foreign intelligence agencies trying to destabilize pakistan.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.27.184.202|86.27.184.202]] ([[User talk:86.27.184.202|talk]]) 17:55, 23 February 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

About this revert : [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balochistan_Liberation_Army&amp;diff=290748317&amp;oldid=290748165], I'm interested to know what's the reason to revert?Thank you--[[User:Alborz Fallah|Alborz Fallah]] ([[User talk:Alborz Fallah|talk]]) 17:13, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

The BLA are terrorists as they have killed women and children without any remorse. They have gone against Baloch Tradition by Killing women and i belive that they should burn in hell for that. They are a shame to their ancestoers and must be crushed.

I am a Pakhtoon and if the BLA even harm a hair on a Pashtoon then see the concequences......

== Removed some POV ==

Ok, I have edited the parts of this article which could be perceived as POVs. If anyone has any objections regarding my edits please let me know.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Morara|Morara]] ([[User talk:Morara|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Morara|contribs]]) 01:33, 7 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::The article is not about what we believe to be true, it's about summarising facts.  The term &quot;terrorist&quot; is appropriate to use in contexts such as &quot;such and such government has listed the BLA as a terrorist group (footnote).&quot;  Use outside that context is controversial, and I think most folks would support your removing it ''when not linked to a specific fact or official declaration as terrorism by a mentioned party''.  Meanwhile, the category [[:Category:United Kingdom Home Office designated terrorist groups]] is totally appropriat e becaust the UKHO did indeed declare the BLA a terrorist organisation.  That doesn't mean they ''are'', but neutral persons must agree that the UKHO did indeed declare such.  Make sense?  [[User:MatthewVanitas|MatthewVanitas]] ([[User talk:MatthewVanitas|talk]]) 04:24, 27 October 2009 (UTC)
:::A couple of issues with this article:
:::*the external links reads like an advert for all things Balochi, ive trimmed it down
:::*I've altered the use of the words terror to something less POV and left it where cited and appropriate.[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 08:04, 25 April 2010 (UTC)

== Tag why ==

For reasons known only to himself Mar4d has reverted the change from terrorist to militant, which is strange as not so long ago he was insisting on Lashkar-e-Taiba that [[WP:LABEL]] was important enough to not call them terrorists[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lashkar-e-Taiba&amp;diff=496734050&amp;oldid=496729417] So the article is obviously not neutral and as such I have tagged it. [[User:Darkness Shines|Darkness Shines]] ([[User talk:Darkness Shines|talk]]) 14:19, 1 August 2012 (UTC)
*As Mar4d has not responded to this thread I have self reverted the POV tag and restored my edit. [[User:Darkness Shines|Darkness Shines]] ([[User talk:Darkness Shines|talk]]) 14:14, 2 August 2012 (UTC)

== Removal of references ==

So when I take time out to find a reference I do not expect it to be removed. Would our tag teaming couple please explain as to why the reference for separatist has been removed? [[User:Darkness Shines|Darkness Shines]] ([[User talk:Darkness Shines|talk]]) 11:00, 11 October 2012 (UTC)
:Ignore, I looked at the wrong diff. [[User:Darkness Shines|Darkness Shines]] ([[User talk:Darkness Shines|talk]]) 11:02, 11 October 2012 (UTC)

== Edits by [[User:Faizan]] ==

[[User:Faizan]] repeatedly keeps modifying the article by inserting the &quot;terrorism&quot;, &quot;terrorist&quot;, etc., labels with relation to BLA, thus promoting [[WP:POV]] of the current Pakistan's government. [[WP:TERRORIST]] has a clear guidance when such POV terms can be used - i.e., only with attribution to the POV holder(s). Nevertheless, Faizan keeps reverting any attempts to replace the term with more neutral wording.

Of note, even the lede of [[Osama bin Ladin]] does not resort to the &quot;terrorist&quot; brand.

Thanks for your comments. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Candara',sans-serif;&quot;&gt;[[User:Kashmiri|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#30C;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-shadow:#AAF 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;kashmiri&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Kashmiri|&lt;sup style=&quot;color:#80F;&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:14, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

== Edit revert ==

Can you explain the reasons of you reverting my edits to the article? As far as I am concerned, nothing relevant was dropped out of the article except multitude of headers and repeat information contained in a linked article. Can you specify what you didn't like about the edit? &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Candara',sans-serif;&quot;&gt;[[User:Kashmiri|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#30C;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-shadow:#AAF 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;kashmiri&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Kashmiri|&lt;sup style=&quot;color:#80F;&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:49, 27 June 2013 (UTC)
:Well the talk page of the article was a better place for this. Most probably you are talking about this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balochistan_Liberation_Army&amp;diff=561816302&amp;oldid=561731750 edit]? Such large-scale edits should be made with consensus. You blanked a section named &quot;Claimed attacks&quot;, which covered an important [[2013 Quaid-e-Azam Residency attack|terrorist attack]] on the [[Quaid-e-Azam residency]]. I reverted due to this &quot;Unexplained section blanking&quot;. My regards. &lt;span style=&quot;border:2px solid #000;background:#000&quot;&gt;[[User:Faizan|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff;&quot;&gt;Fai&lt;/span&gt;]][[User Talk:Faizan|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0f0&quot;&gt;zan&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:57, 27 June 2013 (UTC)
::Yes, I shortened the section to practically one sentence. For example, saying that &quot;BLA claimed responsibility for the attack&quot; was superfluous as the talk is about ''attacks by BLA'' (else there would be no point of discussing the event in the article). Other sentences just copied the sources with the description of the attack (flag replacement, etc.) - unnecessary for the article on BLA when there is a separate article on the attack itself.
:: There is no need for consensus when edits don't involve significant loss of information. See [[WP:BOLD]] for policy details.
:: I have a feeling you reverted my edit just because you don't like me editing this article altogether. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Candara',sans-serif;&quot;&gt;[[User:Kashmiri|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#30C;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-shadow:#AAF 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;kashmiri&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Kashmiri|&lt;sup style=&quot;color:#80F;&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:11, 27 June 2013 (UTC)
::: BTW, I think we disagree as to the definition of &quot;large-scale edits&quot;. These are all in all 13 lines of a start-class article! &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Candara',sans-serif;&quot;&gt;[[User:Kashmiri|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#30C;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-shadow:#AAF 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;kashmiri&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Kashmiri|&lt;sup style=&quot;color:#80F;&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:24, 27 June 2013 (UTC)
::::Well, There is a separate article for the attack, but we will need its summary here too, because BLA was it preparator. Besides I am not concerned with the &quot;13 lines&quot;, &quot;large-scale changes&quot; can be made with 5 lines even. I am not talking about &quot;large-line changes&quot;. You are Welcome to restore your edit, but the unexplained section blanking is not acceptable. My regrets for the revert, but please restore the section if you edit the article, I am not your enemy, or this is not that like I dislike your editing. My regards. &lt;span style=&quot;border:2px solid #000;background:#000&quot;&gt;[[User:Faizan|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff;&quot;&gt;Fai&lt;/span&gt;]][[User Talk:Faizan|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0f0&quot;&gt;zan&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:09, 28 June 2013 (UTC)
::::: It wasn't &quot;unexplained&quot; - the reorganisation of the article was mentioned in edit summary: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balochistan_Liberation_Army&amp;diff=561816302&amp;oldid=561731750]. Apart from that, the article still lacks key information on its subject the Baloch Liberation Army: its genesis, history, messages/appeals, leadership succession, weaponry sources, reception in the province and country, etc. Devoting 1/3 of the article to a single attack (out of several dozens carried out by the group, and one that already has an entry on its own) is completely out of proportion IMHO - see [[WP:RECENT]] for an excellent guidance. I will think of ways to restore the article so as to preserve newer edits.
::::: Thanks for moving the discussion here.
