'''USS ''Castor'' (AKS-1)''' was a [[Castor class general stores issue ship|''Castor''-class]] [[general stores issue ship]] commissioned by the [[U.S. Navy]] for service in [[World War II]]. She was responsible for delivering and disbursing goods and equipment to locations in the war zone.

''Castor'' (AKS-1) was launched as SS ''Challenger'' on 20 May 1939 by [[Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock]] Co., [[Kearny, New Jersey]], under a [[Maritime Commission]] contract; sponsored by Mrs. T. M. Woodward; acquired by the Navy 23 October 1940 and renamed ''Castor'' six days later; and commissioned 12 March 1941, Commander F. Johnson in command.

== World War II Pacific Theatre operations ==
 
Clearing [[Norfolk, Virginia]], 6 May 1941, ''Castor'' arrived at [[San Diego, California]], 20 May to begin a series of cargo voyages to [[Pearl Harbor]]. In October, she carried [[U.S. Marine]] reinforcements to [[Johnston Island]] and [[Wake Island]].

=== Strafed at Pearl Harbor ===

Returning to [[San Francisco, California]], to load explosives, ''Castor'' arrived in Pearl Harbor three days before the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] attack of 7 December 1941. Her guns were quickly brought into action, and while she was repeatedly strafed by enemy planes, she suffered little damage and no casualties in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/docs/wwii/pearl/ph31.htm USS ''Castor'', Report of Pearl Harbor Attack&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transporting emergency material after start of war ===
 
Until 7 February 1942, ''Castor'' carried cargo from the [[U.S. West Coast]] to aid in the buildup of [[Pearl Harbor]] as the nerve center for the [[Pacific Ocean]], then aided in the opening of operations in the critical South Pacific area with cargo runs from San Francisco to bases in [[New Caledonia]], the [[New Hebrides]], the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], and [[New Zealand]]. A cargo voyage to [[Funafuti]] and [[Espiritu Santo]] in November and December 1943 found her carrying essential supplies for the [[Gilbert Islands]] invasion.

=== Invasion forces support ===

From January 1944, her voyages from the west coast were to bases in the [[Marshall Islands]], and after a brief overhaul at [[Seattle, Washington]], ''Castor'' reported at [[Manus Island|Manus]] 18 September for duty with famed [[task force]] TF 58. Operating primarily from Manus and [[Ulithi]], she replenished the fast carrier task force at sea thus helping to expedite the smashing series of raids which pushed the Japanese ever westward. The final phase of these operations found the cargo ship acting in support of the assault on [[Okinawa]], off which she operated through May and June 1945. Unscathed by the inferno which [[kamikaze]] attacks made of duty off Okinawa, ''Castor'' sailed for overhaul at San Francisco on 10 July.

=== End-of-war activity ===
 
Between December 1945 and February 1947, ''Castor'' supplied occupation forces in the [[Far East]], calling at [[Guam]], [[Saipan]], [[Tsingtao]], [[Hong Kong]], and Japanese ports. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at San Francisco 30 June 1947.

== Reactivated during Korean War ==
 
With the outbreak of war in [[Korea]], ''Castor'' was recommissioned 24 November 1950, and cleared San Francisco 11 March 1951 for training at Pearl Harbor. She arrived at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] 14 May and from this base supplied ships in the harbors of [[Inchon]] and [[Pusan]], Korea, as well as replenishing ships of task force TF 77 at sea.

=== Dead in the water during a bad storm ===

Leaving [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]] astern 18 March 1952, ''Castor'' ran into a fierce storm which damaged her engines and left her dead in the water for 22 hours until she could be towed back to Japan for emergency repairs. She arrived at San Francisco 25 April for overhaul and permanent repairs.

=== Home port at Yokosuka ===
 
On 9 September 1952, ''Castor'' returned to [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], now to be her home port. Since that date and through 1962 she has operated from Yokosuka and occasionally from [[Subic Bay]], [[Philippine Islands]], supporting the ever more important operations of [[U.S. 7th Fleet]], as it carries out its assignment to keep the [[Taiwan]] Patrol Force at sea, and in September 1954 took part in the [[Vietnam]]ese evacuation, [[Operation Passage to Freedom]], off [[Indo-China]]. An overhaul at San Francisco early in 1955 fitted her to carry both technical and general stores.

== Rescuing typhoon survivors ==
 
While bound for Subic Bay on 19 October 1956, ''Castor'' fought her way unscathed through a furious [[typhoon]], and next day received a distress message from the Philippine merchantman [[SS Lepus|SS ''Lepus'']]. With the aid of search planes, ''Castor'' located and rescued 11 survivors of the stricken ship. This rescue won a citation and plaque for ''Castor'' from Philippine President [[Ramon Magsaysay]].

== Vietnam War operations ==

Castor was homeported in Sasebo, Japan during the mid sixties. She made runs to Vietnam, picking up stores in Sasebo, Subic Bay, Philippines and Kaoshung, Taiwan.  She and {{USS|Mars|AFS-1}}and Castor's sister ship {{USS|Pollux|AKS-4}} which was home ported in Yokosuka, Japan were the only supply ships serving the Vietnam units until ''Castor''{{'}}s decommissioning.  Pollux was also decommissioned during the Vietnam War (1968).
