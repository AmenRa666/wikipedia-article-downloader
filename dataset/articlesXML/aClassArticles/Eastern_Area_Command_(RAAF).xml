'''Eastern Area Command''' was one of several [[RAAF area commands|geographically based commands]] raised by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) during {{nowrap|World War II}}. It was formed in May 1942, and controlled units based in [[New South Wales]] and southern [[Queensland]]. Headquartered in [[Sydney]], Eastern Area Command was primarily responsible for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]], [[aerial reconnaissance]] and protection of the [[sea lane]]s within its boundaries. The area continued to function following the end of the war, transferring its headquarters to [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Glenbrook]], in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], in 1949. By this time most of the RAAF's operational units were based within Eastern Area's boundaries. It was re-formed in October 1953 as [[RAAF Home Command|Home Command]] (renamed [[RAAF Operational Command|Operational Command]] in 1959, and [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]] in 1987) under the RAAF's new functional command-and-control system.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:RAAFAreaCommands1940.png|thumb|upright=1.28|left|alt=Map of Australia showing state borders, with RAAF area command boundaries superimposed|Area commands as planned in February 1940]]
Prior to World War&amp;nbsp;II, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by RAAF Headquarters in [[Melbourne]]. When war broke out, the RAAF began to decentralise its command structure, commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units.&lt;ref name=Stephens111&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Power Development Centre&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Organising for War: The RAAF Air Campaigns in the Pacific | magazine = Pathfinder|issue=  121| date = October 2009| url = http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Publications/Details/403/121-Organising-for-War-The-RAAF-Air-Campaigns-in-the-Pacific.aspx|publisher=[[Royal Australian Air Force|Air Power Development Centre]]|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between March 1940 and May 1941, Australia and [[Territory of Papua|Papua]] were divided into four [[RAAF area commands|geographically based command-and-control zones]]: [[Central Area Command (RAAF)|Central Area]], [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area]], [[Western Area Command (RAAF)|Western Area]], and [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area]].&lt;ref name=Gillison91&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 91–92]&lt;/ref&gt; The roles of the area commands were  [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]], protection of adjacent [[sea lane]]s, and [[aerial reconnaissance]]. Each was led by an [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) who controlled the administration and operations of all air bases and units within his boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Power Development Centre&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison91/&gt;

Central Area was disbanded in August 1941 and its responsibilities divided between Southern Area, Northern Area, and the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;2 (Training) Group.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 112]&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of the [[Pacific War]] resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western]] and [[North-Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|North-Eastern Areas]], to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea.&lt;ref name=Stephens111/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070486--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 311]&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Air Board proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, Eastern Area, which would also assume control of units in southern [[Queensland]] from North-Eastern Area.&lt;ref name=Ashworth134&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume One'', pp. xxi, 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Edgecliff, New South Wales|Edgecliff]], Eastern Area Command was formed on 15&amp;nbsp;May 1942 under the leadership of Air Vice Marshal [[William Anderson (RAAF officer)|Bill Anderson]]. Staff numbered 114, including forty-five officers.&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Training units in New South Wales remained part of No.&amp;nbsp;2 (Training) Group. No.&amp;nbsp;5 (Maintenance) Group was formed in Sydney on 1&amp;nbsp;June, and took responsibility for all maintenance units initially controlled by Eastern Area Command.&lt;ref name=Ashworth134/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume Two'', p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the Allied Air Forces commander in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]], Major General [[George Kenney]], formed the majority of his US flying units into the [[Fifth Air Force]], and most of their Australian counterparts into [[RAAF Command]], led by Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070519--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 585–588]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan ch.01 pp. 4-6&quot;&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070530--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 4–6]&lt;/ref&gt; Bostock exercised control of Australian air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority, meaning that Bostock and his area commanders were ultimately dependent on the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], for supplies and equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp. 144–145&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt;

Of necessity, the RAAF's two northerly area commands were primarily responsible for bombing and air defence, while the other commands focussed on [[maritime patrol]] and [[anti-submarine warfare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp. 144–145&quot;/&gt; Aircraft from Eastern Area flew over 400 patrol, anti-submarine, and convoy escort missions in January 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; By April, the command was operating seven combat units: [[No. 5 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 Squadron]], flying [[army cooperation]] missions with [[CAC Wirraway]]s out of [[Kingaroy, Queensland|Kingaroy]], Queensland; [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;23 Squadron]], flying dive-bombing missions with Wirraways from [[Lowood, Queensland|Lowood]], Queensland; [[No. 24 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron]], flying dive-bombing missions with Wirraways from [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]], New South Wales; [[No. 32 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;32 Squadron]], flying reconnaissance and bombing missions with [[Lockheed Hudson]]s from [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], New South Wales; [[No. 71 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 Squadron]], flying maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions with [[Avro Anson]]s from Lowood; [[No. 73 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;73 Squadron]], flying maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions with Ansons from [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]], New South Wales; and [[No. 83 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;83 Squadron]], flying fighter missions with Wirraways from [[Strathpine, Queensland|Strathpine]], Queensland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan ch.09 p. 141&quot;&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070558--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt; Area headquarters staff numbered 626, including ninety-nine officers.&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol Beaufort]]s of No.&amp;nbsp;32 Squadron were credited with damaging a Japanese submarine on 19&amp;nbsp;June, but neither the RAAF nor the [[Royal Australian Navy]] was able to destroy any enemy submarines in coastal waters during 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070558--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 152–153]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson handed over command of Eastern Area to Air Commodore John Summers in July 1943.&lt;ref name=Ashworth303&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!

The new command, to be known as Central Area, would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern Queensland; the [[War Cabinet]] deferred its decision on the proposal. The concept was raised again in August 1944, and this time Central Area Command was to control maintenance units, as well as training and operations, in southern Queensland; once again, nothing came of the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume One'', pp. 214–217, 227–228&lt;/ref&gt;

Air Commodore [[Alan Charlesworth]] was appointed AOC Eastern Area in December 1943.&lt;ref name=Ashworth303/&gt;  Japanese submarine activity had decreased in the months prior to Charlesworth taking command, and he was concerned that Allied ships were becoming complacent. He observed &quot;a general slackening off in procedure; ships are seldom where they should be, and a minority of merchant ships identify themselves to aircraft&quot;. The RAAF's patrols had also settled into a predictable pattern that an observant submarine captain could easily avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070395--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 349]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Charlesworth relinquished command in September 1944 to take over North-Western Area.&lt;ref name=Ashworth304&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume One'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17920555 |title=New Air Member for Personnel |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| date=13 September 1944 |accessdate=2 August 2015 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, aircraft from Eastern Area took part in the search for the German submarine ''[[German submarine U-862|U-862]]'', but could not prevent it sinking the [[Liberty ship]] ''Robert J. Walker'' on [[Christmas]]; a Beaufort of [[No. 15 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;15 Squadron]], based at [[Camden Airport (New South Wales)|Camden]], located the wreck. No.&amp;nbsp;32 Squadron lost a Beaufort with its crew shortly after takeoff from Lowood during the search for ''U-862'', which was called off in January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', pp. 269–272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers350&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070395--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 350–351]&lt;/ref&gt; That month, Air Commodore [[Leon Lachal]] became AOC Eastern Area, and held command for the duration of the Pacific War.&lt;ref name=Ashworth304/&gt;

===Post-war activity and reorganisation===
Following the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, South West Pacific Area was dissolved and RAAF Headquarters again assumed full control of all its operational elements, including the area commands.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume One'', p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official history of the post-war Air Force, the AOC Eastern Area was considered &quot;Australia's senior operational airman&quot; and delegated by the Chief of the Air Staff with day-to-day responsibility for the nation's air defence.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the RAAF's bases and aircraft employed in operations were situated within Eastern Area's sphere of control in New South Wales and southern Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Air Commodore [[Frank Lukis]] succeeded Lachal as AOC in December 1945. By the end of the month, headquarters staff numbered 1,122, including 104 officers.&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', pp. 1101, 1105&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No. 82 (Bomber) Wing]] came under the control of Eastern Area Command in April 1946, when it moved to [[RAAF Base Amberley|RAAF Station Amberley]], Queensland; initially operating [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]], the wing re-equipped with [[Avro Lincoln]]s soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Highest Traditions'', pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DVA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clik.dva.gov.au/history-library/part-3-order-battle/ch-2-order-battle-air-force/s-2-headquarters|title=Order of Battle&amp;nbsp;– Air Force&amp;nbsp;– Headquarters|publisher=[[Department of Veterans' Affairs (Australia)|Department of Veterans' Affairs]]|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time Eastern Area headquarters occupied seven mansions in [[Point Piper]], Sydney; it subsequently relocated to [[RAAF Bradfield Park|Bradfield Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17988548 |title=RAAF units for Bradfield |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 May 1946 |accessdate=6 August 2015 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17987345 |title=RAAF to leave Point Piper |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=12 June 1946 |accessdate=6 August 2015 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lukis retired from the Air Force in May, and Charlesworth took over command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1205030|title= Lukis, Francis William Fellowes|work= World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17981841 |title=All Air Force cottages seized |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=1 June 1946 |accessdate=8 August 2015 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July–August 1946, Eastern Area Command oversaw the establishment of [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;86 (Transport) Wing]], operating [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakotas]], at [[RAAF Station Schofields]], New South Wales, displacing [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 (Fighter) Wing]], which moved to [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAAF Station Williamtown]], and began operating [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=No. 78 Wing Headquarters|title=Operations Record Book |url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=1360020|work=RAAF Unit History sheets |date=1943–59 |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|pages=106–108|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Air Vice Marshal Jones proposed reducing the five mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern Area, covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The proposal was part of a much larger plan to restructure the post-war RAAF; the Federal government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries largely remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''The Private Air Marshal'', pp. 321–325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 68, 462&lt;/ref&gt; Lachal succeeded Charlesworth as AOC Eastern Area in October, and held command until his retirement from the Air Force in July 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article133174708 |title=Air chief on tour of inspection |newspaper=[[The Newcastle Herald]] |date=25 October 1946 |accessdate=8 August 2015 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=R&amp;VeteranId=1204621|title=Lachal, Leon Victor|work= World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal government retired Air Marshal Jones in 1952 and replaced him with Air Marshal [[Donald Hardman]], RAF, who proceeded to re-organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines, establishing [[RAAF Home Command|Home]] (operational), [[RAAF Training Command|Training]], and [[RAAF Maintenance Command|Maintenance Commands]] in October 1953. The first was re-formed from Eastern Area Command as it was considered the RAAF's ''de facto'' operational organisation. The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command, as it was the hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and last functional command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pathfinder&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Sir Donald Hardman’s Reorganisation of the RAAF| magazine = Pathfinder|issue=  106| date = March 2009| url = http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Publications/Details/380/106-Sir-Donald-Hardmans-Reorganisation-of-the-RAAF.aspx|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 73–76, 462–463&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The functional commands established in 1953–54 were revised in 1959. Home Command was renamed [[RAAF Operational Command|Operational Command]], and Training and Maintenance Commands merged to become [[RAAF Support Command|Support Command]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; Operational Command was renamed [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]] in 1987, and three years later Support Command split into [[RAAF Logistics Command|Logistics Command]] and Training Command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford150&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the evolution from Home to Operational to Air Command, the headquarters remained at Glenbrook in the Blue Mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; In 1997, logistics management became the responsibility of Support Command (Air Force), the RAAF component of the Defence-wide Support Command Australia (later subsumed by the [[Defence Materiel Organisation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uat.defence.gov.au/AnnualReports/97-98/dar98pr6.pdf|title=Program 6: Support Command|work=Defence Annual Report 1997–98|page=224|date=1998|publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''Making the Australian Defence Force'', pp. 278–279&lt;/ref&gt; Training Command was re-formed as [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]], a [[Force Element Group|force element group]] under Air Command, in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About_us/Structure_of_the_RAAF/Air_Command/Air_Force_Training_Group/?RAAF-hq2wskEcYXfEfqWNOvO1s4mdhi2R+mo+ |title=Air Force Training Group|publisher= [[Royal Australian Air Force]]|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air Command thus became the sole command-level organisation in the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/organisation/aircommand/index.htm |title=Air Command |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=10 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720065652/http://www.airforce.gov.au/organisation/aircommand/index.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
