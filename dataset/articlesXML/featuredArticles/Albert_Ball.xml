'''Albert Ball''', [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Medal bar|&amp; Two Bars]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (14 August 1896&amp;nbsp;– 7&amp;nbsp;May 1917) was an English [[fighter pilot]] during the First World War. At the time of his death he was the United Kingdom's leading [[flying ace]], with 44 victories, and remained its fourth-highest scorer behind [[Mick Mannock|Edward Mannock]], [[James McCudden]], and [[George McElroy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shores|title= British and Empire Aces of World War 1 |page= 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born and raised in [[Nottingham]], Ball joined the [[Sherwood Foresters]] at the outbreak of the First World War and was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in October 1914. He transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) the following year, and gained his pilot's [[Aircrew brevet|wings]] on 26&amp;nbsp;January 1916. Joining [[No. 13 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;13 Squadron RFC]] in France, he flew reconnaissance missions before being posted in May to [[No. 11 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Squadron]], a fighter unit. From then until his return to England on leave in October, he accrued many aerial victories, earning two [[Distinguished Service Order]]s and the [[Military Cross]]. He was the first ace to become a British national hero.

After a period on home establishment, Ball was posted to [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;56 Squadron]], which deployed to the Western Front in April 1917. He crashed to his death in a field in France on 7&amp;nbsp;May, sparking a wave of national mourning and posthumous recognition, which included the award of the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions during his final tour of duty. The famous German flying ace [[Manfred von Richthofen]], remarked upon hearing of Ball's death that he was &quot;by far the best English flying man&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Albert Ball was born on 14 August 1896 at 301 Lenton Boulevard in [[Lenton, Nottingham]]. After a series of moves throughout the area, his family settled at ''Sedgley'', 43&amp;nbsp;Lenton Road. His parents were [[Albert Ball (politician)|Albert Ball]], a successful businessman who rose from employment as a plumber to become [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham]], and who was later [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]], and Harriett Mary Page. Young Albert had two siblings, a brother and a sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Gunby|first= David | title =Ball, Albert (1896–1917)|encyclopedia=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |pages=553–55| year = 2004 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-861353-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenton&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lentontimes.co.uk/images/gallery/albert_ball/albert_ball_listener_14.htm |title=Albert Ball V.C | work =The Lenton Listener, Issue 14|date=September–October 1981 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His parents were considered loving and indulgent. In his youth, Ball had a small hut behind the family house where he tinkered with engines and electrical equipment. He was raised with a knowledge of firearms, and conducted target practice in ''Sedgley'''s gardens. Possessed of keen vision, he soon became a crack shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer | title =Albert Ball VC |pages= 19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also deeply religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bowyer| title = Albert Ball VC | page= 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not curb his daring in such boyhood pursuits as [[steeplejack]]ing;&lt;ref&gt;Pengelly. ''Albert Ball VC: The Fighter Pilot Hero of World War I.'' p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; on his 16th birthday, he accompanied a local workman to the top of a tall factory chimney and strolled about unconcerned by the height.&lt;ref&gt;Bowyer. ''Albert Ball VC.'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball studied at the Lenton Church School, [[The King's School, Grantham|Grantham Grammar School]] and [[Nottingham High School]] before transferring to [[Trent College]] in January 1911, at the age of 14. As a student he displayed only average ability, but was able to develop his curiosity for things mechanical. His best subjects were carpentry, modelling, violin and photography.  He also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]]. When Albert left school in December 1913, aged 17, his father helped him gain employment at Universal Engineering Works near the family home.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pengelly|title= Albert Ball VC: The Fighter Pilot Hero of World War I|pages= 15–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First World War ==

=== Initial war service ===
Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Ball enlisted in the British Army, joining the [[Robin Hood Battalion|2/7th (Robin Hood) Battalion]] of the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]]. Soon promoted to  [[sergeant]], he gained his commission as a [[second lieutenant]] on 29 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;For Valour&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=For Valour|pages=100–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28954 |date=28 October 1914 |startpage=8741 |endpage=8742 | supp=yes |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to training recruits, but this rear-echelon role irked him. In an attempt to see action, he transferred early the following year to the North Midlands Cyclist Company, Divisional Mounted Troops, but remained confined to a posting in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenton&quot;/&gt; On 24 February 1915, he wrote to his parents, &quot;I have just sent five boys to France, and I hear that they will be in the firing line on Monday. It is just my luck to be unable to go.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 =Briscoe | last2 = Stannard|title=Captain Ball VC|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1915, Ball began a short-lived engagement to Dot Allbourne (or Ellbourne), though he was still interested in other girls such as Thelma Starr.&lt;ref&gt;Pengelly. ''Albert Ball VC: The Fighter Pilot Hero of World War I.'' pp. 24–27, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; In June, he decided to take private flying lessons at [[Hendon Aerodrome]], which would give him an outlet for his interest in engineering and possibly help him to see action in France sooner. He paid to undertake pilot training in his own time at the Ruffy-Baumann School, which charged £75 to £100 for instruction&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowyer pp.35-36&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; (£5,580 to £7,440 in 2010 prices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retail Prices Index comparison|url= http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/|publisher= Measuring Worth|accessdate= 12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball would wake at 3:00&amp;nbsp;am to ride his motorcycle to Ruffy-Baumann for flying practice at dawn, before beginning his daily military duty at 6:45&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowyer pp.35-36&quot;/&gt; His training at Ruffy-Baumann was not unique; [[Edwin Cole (RAF officer)|Edwin Cole]] was learning to fly there at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date = 14 December 1915| title = The Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom: Official Notices to Members| url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1915/1915%20-%201053.html  | journal = [[Flight International|Flight]] | page= 1017 | accessdate =6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In letters home Ball recorded that he found flying &quot;great sport&quot;, and displayed what [[Peter de la Billière]] described as &quot;almost brutal&quot; detachment regarding accidents suffered by his fellow trainees:
{{quote|Yesterday a ripping boy had a smash, and when we got up to him he was nearly dead, he had a two-inch piece of wood right through his head and died this morning. If you would like a flight I should be pleased to take you any time you wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Billière|title=Supreme Courage|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Military flight training and reconnaissance work ===
[[File:Albert Ball portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Ball in front of an obsolete [[Caudron G.3]], widely used as a trainer in 1915–16|alt=Half portrait of young dark-haired man in military uniform with coat over left arm, standing in front of biplane]]
Although considered an average pilot at best by his instructors,&lt;ref&gt;Pengelly. ''Albert Ball VC: The Fighter Pilot Hero of World War I.'' p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Ball qualified for his [[Royal Aero Club]] certificate (no.&amp;nbsp;1898) on 15 October 1915, and promptly requested transfer to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC).&lt;ref&gt;Pengelly. ''Albert Ball VC: The Fighter Pilot Hero of World War I.'' p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; He was seconded to [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 (Reserve) Squadron RFC]] on 23 October, and trained at [[RAF Mousehold Heath|Mousehold Heath]] aerodrome near [[Norwich]]. In the first week of December, he soloed in a [[Farman MF.7|Maurice Farman ''Longhorn'']] after standing duty all night, and his touchdown was rough. When his instructor commented sarcastically on the landing, Ball angrily exclaimed that he had only 15 minutes experience in the plane, and that if this was the best instruction he was going to get, he would rather return to his old unit. The instructor relented, and Ball then soloed again and landed successfully in five consecutive flights. His rough landing was not the last Ball was involved in; he survived two others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 45–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his training at [[Central Flying School]], Upavon, and was awarded his [[Aircrew brevet|wings]] on 22 January 1916.&lt;ref name=&quot;For Valour&quot;/&gt; A week later, he was officially transferred from the North Midlands Cyclist Company to the RFC as a pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29473 |date=11 February 1916 |startpage=1660 |supp=yes |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29470 |date=11 February 1916 |startpage=1589 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 February 1916, Ball joined [[No. 13 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;13 Squadron RFC]] at [[Marieux]] in France, flying a two-seat [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]]c on reconnaissance missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;For Valour&quot;/&gt; He survived being shot down by anti-aircraft fire on 27 March. Three days later, he fought the first of several combats in the B.E.2; he and his observer, Lieutenant S. A.&amp;nbsp;Villiers, fired a [[Drum magazine|drum]] and a half of [[Lewis gun]] ammunition at an enemy two-seater, but were driven off by a second one. After this inconclusive skirmish, Ball wrote home in one of his many letters, &quot;I like this job, but nerves do not last long, and you soon want a rest&quot;. In letters home to his father, he discouraged the idea of his younger brother following him into the RFC. Ball and Villiers tried unsuccessfully to shoot down an enemy observation balloon in their two-seater on 10 April. Ball's burgeoning skills and aggressiveness gained him access to the squadron's single-seat [[Bristol Scout]] fighter later that month.&lt;ref&gt;Pengelly. ''Albert Ball VC: The Fighter Pilot Hero of World War I.'' pp. 53–61.&lt;/ref&gt; April 1916 also saw Ball's first mention in a letter home of plans for &quot;a most wonderful machine&amp;nbsp;... heaps better than the Hun Fokker&quot;. It is now generally believed that these &quot;plans&quot; were unconnected with the design of the [[Austin-Ball A.F.B.1]], with which he later became involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce, J. M.|title=War Planes of the First World War|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initial fighter posting ===
On 7 May 1916, Ball was posted to [[No. 11 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Squadron]], which operated a mix of fighters including Bristol Scouts, [[Nieuport 16]]s, and [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2]]b [[pusher configuration|&quot;pushers&quot;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nieuport Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;British and Empire Aces&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Shores|title= British and Empire Aces of World War 1 |pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his first day of flying with his new unit, he wrote a letter home complaining about fatigue. He was unhappy with the hygiene of his assigned billet in the nearest village, and elected to live in a tent on the flight line. Ball built a hut for himself to replace the tent and cultivated a garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 64–65, 88–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his flying service Ball was primarily a &quot;lone-wolf&quot; pilot, stalking his prey from below until he drew close enough to use his top-wing Lewis gun on its [[Foster mounting]], angled to fire upwards into the enemy's fuselage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nieuport Aces&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Franks|title= Nieuport Aces of World War 1 |pages=9–11, 28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SE5&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Franks|title=SE5/5a Aces of World War 1|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to fellow ace and [[Victoria Cross]] recipient [[James McCudden]], &quot;it was quite a work of art to pull this gun down and shoot upwards, and at the same time manage one's machine accurately&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCudden|title=Flying Fury|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ball was as much a loner on the ground as in the air, preferring to stay in his hut on the flight line away from other squadron members. His off-duty hours were spent tending his small garden and practising the violin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenton&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nieuport Aces 12&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Franks|title= Nieuport Aces of World War 1 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though not unsociable per se, he was extremely sensitive and shy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 65, 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball acted as his own mechanic on his aircraft and, as a consequence, was often untidy and dishevelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |page= 155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His singularity in dress extended to his habit of flying without a helmet and goggles, and he wore his thick black hair longer than regulations generally permitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 163, 177–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While flying a Bristol Scout on 16 May 1916, Ball scored his first aerial victory, driving down a German reconnaissance plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; He then switched to Nieuports, bringing down two [[LVG]]s on 29 May and a [[Fokker Eindecker]] on 1 June. On 25 June he became a [[balloon buster]] and an [[Flying ace|ace]] by destroying an observation balloon with [[phosphor]] bombs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trenches&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Shores|title= Above the Trenches |pages= 59–60 |displayauthors= etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the month he had written to his parents admonishing them to try and &quot;take it well&quot; if he was killed, &quot;for men tons better than I go in hundreds every day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|title=The Dream of Civilised Warfare|pages=245–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again achieved two victories in one [[sortie]] on 2 July, shooting down a [[LFG Roland C.II|Roland C.II]] and an [[Aviatik]] to bring his score to seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Franks|title= Nieuport Aces of World War 1 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball then requested a few days off but, to his dismay, was temporarily reassigned to aerial reconnaissance duty with [[No. 8 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;8 Squadron]], where he flew B.E.2s from 18 July until 14 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; During this posting, Ball undertook an unusual mission. On the evening of 28 July, he flew a French [[field agent|espionage agent]] across enemy lines. Dodging an attack by three German fighters, as well as anti-aircraft fire, he landed in a deserted field, only to find that the agent refused to get out of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was on reconnaissance duties with No. 8 Squadron, the ''[[London Gazette]]'' announced that he had been awarded the [[Military Cross]] &quot;for conspicuous skill and gallantry on many occasions,&quot; particularly for &quot;one occasion [when] he attacked six in one flight&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29684 |date=25 July 1916 |startpage=7435 |supp=yes |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not unusual; throughout his career, Ball generally attacked on sight and heedless of the odds. He professed no hatred for his opponents, writing to his parents &quot;I only scrap because it is my duty&amp;nbsp;... Nothing makes me feel more rotten than to see them go down, but you see it is either them or me, so I must do my duty best to make it a case of ''them''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;For Valour&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Q 045379Nieuport17.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Nieuport 17, a type flown by Ball in No.&amp;nbsp;60 Squadron|alt=Front three-quarter view of military biplane on airfield]]
Ball's 20th birthday was marked by his promotion to temporary captain and his return to No. 11 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; He destroyed three Roland C.IIs in one sortie on 22 August 1916, the first RFC pilot to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trenches&quot;/&gt; He ended the day by fighting 14 Germans some {{convert|15|mi|km}} behind their lines. With his plane badly damaged and out of fuel, he struggled back to Allied lines to land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 93–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred with part of No.&amp;nbsp;11 Squadron to [[No. 60 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;60 Squadron RFC]] on 23 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nieuport Aces&quot;/&gt;  His new commanding officer gave Ball a free rein to fly solo missions, and assigned him his own personal aircraft and maintenance crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |page= 97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the squadron mechanics painted up a non-standard red propeller boss; A201 became the first of a series of Ball's aeroplanes to have such a colour scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |page= 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that it helped his fellow squadron members identify his plane and confirm his combat claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Briscoe; Stannard|title=Captain Ball VC|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; By end of the month, he had increased his tally to 17 enemy aircraft, including three on 28 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trenches&quot;/&gt;

Ball then took leave in England. His feats in France had received considerable publicity. He was the first British ace to become a household name, and found that his celebrity was such that he could not walk down the streets of Nottingham without being stopped and congratulated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 107–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this the British government had suppressed the names of its aces—in contrast to the policy of the French and Germans—but the losses of the [[Battle of the Somme]], which had commenced in July, made politic the publicising of its successes in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson. ''The Dream of Civilised Warfare''. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Ball's achievements had a profound impact on budding flyer [[Mick Mannock]], who would become the United Kingdom's top-scoring ace and also receive the Victoria Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dudgeon|title=Mick|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shores|title= British and Empire Aces of World War 1 |pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon return to No. 60 Squadron in France, Ball scored morning and evening victories on 15&amp;nbsp;September, flying two different Nieuports. On the evening mission, he armed his plane with eight [[Le Prieur rocket]]s on the outer struts, set to fire electrically. He intended to use them on an observation balloon. As it happened, he spotted three German Roland C.IIs and broke their formation by salvoing his rockets at them, then picked off one of the confused pilots with machine-gun fire. After this he settled into an improved aeroplane, [[Nieuport 17]] no. A213. He had it rigged to fly tail-heavy to facilitate his changing of ammunition drums in the machine-gun, and had a holster built into the cockpit for the [[M1911 pistol|Colt automatic]] that he habitually carried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC | pages = 121–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three times during September he scored triple victories in a day, ending the month with his total score standing at 31, making him Britain's top-scoring ace.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trenches&quot;/&gt;  By this time he had told his commanding officer that he had to have a rest and that he was taking unnecessary risks because of his nerves.

Ball had been awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) and [[Medal bar|bar]] simultaneously on 26 September 1916. The first award was &quot;for conspicuous gallantry and skill&quot; when he took on two enemy formations.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29765 |date=26 September 1916 |startpage=9419 |endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bar was also &quot;for conspicuous skill and gallantry&quot; when he attacked four enemy aircraft in formation and then, on another occasion, 12 enemy machines.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO Bar&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29765 |date=26 September 1916 |startpage=9421 |endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the Russian [[Order of St. George]] the same month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; Now that Ball had been posted back to England, he was lionised as a national hero with a reputation as a fearless pilot and expert marksman. A crowd of journalists awaited him on his family's doorstep. In an interview, he mentioned being downed six times in combat.&lt;ref name=bowyer140&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |page= 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 November, he was invested with his Military Cross and both DSOs by King [[George V|George&amp;nbsp;V]] at [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenton&quot; /&gt; A second bar to the DSO, for taking on three enemy aircraft and shooting one down, followed on 25 November, making him the first three-time recipient of the award.&lt;ref name=&quot;For Valour&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO 2nd Bar&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29837 |date=24 November 1916 |startpage=11531 |endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ball was promoted to the [[substantive rank]] of [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 8 December 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29891 |date=2 January 1917 |startpage=271 |supp=yes |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of returning to combat after his leave, Ball was posted to instructional duties with [[No. 34 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;34 (Reserve) Squadron RFC]], based at [[Orford Ness]], Suffolk.&lt;ref name=bowyer140/&gt; It was while serving on the home front that he was able to lobby for the building and testing of the Austin-Ball A.F.B.1 fighter. He hoped to be able to take an example of the type to France with him, but the prototype was not completed until after his death in action.&lt;ref&gt;Pengelly. ''Albert Ball VC: The Fighter Pilot Hero of World War I''. pp.&amp;nbsp;209–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In November he was invited to test fly the prototype of the new [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]] single-seat [[Scout (aircraft)|scout]], apparently the first service pilot to do so. He was unimpressed, finding the heavier, more stable fighter less responsive to the controls than the Nieuports he was used to.&lt;ref&gt;Hare. ''The Royal Aircraft Factory''. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; His negative assessment of other aspects of the S.E.'s performance, on the other hand, contrasted markedly with the reactions of fellow pilots who tested the prototype about this time. Ball was to maintain his opinion of the S.E. as a &quot;dud&quot;, at least until he had scored several victories on the type after his return to France.&lt;ref&gt;Pengelly. ''Albert Ball VC: The Fighter Pilot Hero of World War I''. pp.&amp;nbsp;141–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 1917, in a tribute from his native city, Ball became an [[Freedom of the city|Honorary Freeman]] of Nottingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 146, 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he met James McCudden, also on leave, who later reported his impressions in most favourable terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCudden|title=Flying Fury|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, Ball also encountered Canadian pilot [[Billy Bishop]], who had not as yet seen combat. He immediately liked Bishop, and may have helped the latter secure a posting to No.&amp;nbsp;60 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|title=The Dream of Civilised Warfare|pages=252–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March, while off-duty, Ball met 18-year-old Flora Young. He impulsively invited her to fly with him, and she promptly accepted, wearing a leather flying coat that they had borrowed. On 5 April, they became engaged; she wore his silver identification wrist bracelet in lieu of an engagement ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 156–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second fighter posting ===
[[File:Albert Ball SE5a cockpit.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Ball in the cockpit of his S.E.5, April 1917|alt=Side view of dark-haired man in open cockpit of biplane equipped with machine-gun on upper wing]]
Inaction chafed Ball, and he began agitating for a return to combat duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; He finally managed to obtain a posting as a [[Flight commander (position)|flight commander]] with [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;56 Squadron RFC]], considered to be as close to an elite unit as any established by the RFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shores|title= Above the Trenches |page= 36 |displayauthors= etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball was still first among Britain's aces, and some documents hint that his attachment to No.&amp;nbsp;56 Squadron was planned to be temporary. According to one account he had been slated to serve with the unit for only a month to mentor novice pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Revell;  Dempsey|title=No 56 Sqn RAF/RFC |page= 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest type from the Royal Aircraft Factory, the S.E.5, had been selected to equip the new squadron. This choice was viewed with some trepidation by the RFC high command,&lt;ref&gt;Pengelly. ''Albert Ball VC: The Fighter Pilot Hero of World War I.'', pp. 143–45.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ball himself was personally far from happy with the S.E.5. After some intense lobbying he was allowed to retain his Nieuport&amp;nbsp;17 no.&amp;nbsp;B1522 when the unit went to France; the Nieuport was for his solo missions, and he would fly an S.E.5 on patrols with the rest of the squadron. This arrangement had the personal approval of General [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]], who went on to become the first [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] of the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert Ball VC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |page= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Revell;  Dempsey|title=No 56 Sqn RAF/RFC |page= 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;56 Squadron moved to the Western Front on 7 April 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenton&quot; /&gt; On arrival Ball wrote to his parents, &quot;Cheero, am just about to start the great game again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Briscoe; Stannard|title=Captain Ball VC|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S.E.5 no. A4850, fresh from its packing crate, was extensively modified for Ball: in particular he had the [[Synchronization gear|synchronised]] [[Vickers machine gun]] removed, to be replaced with a second Lewis gun fitted to fire downwards through the floor of the cockpit. He also had a slightly larger fuel tank installed. On 9 April, A4850 was refitted, and the downward-firing Lewis gun removed and replaced by the normal Vickers gun mounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 153–55, 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Flora Young on 18 April, Ball mentioned getting his own hut on the flight line, and installing the members of his flight nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |page= 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 1917, Ball was under strict orders to stay over British lines, but still engaged the Germans five times in his Nieuport. In his first combat that day, using his preferred belly shot, he sent an Albatros into a spin, following it down and continuing to fire at it until it struck the ground. It was No.&amp;nbsp;56 Squadron's first victory. Regaining an altitude of {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, he tried to dive underneath an Albatros two-seater and pop up under its belly as usual, but he overshot, and the German rear gunner put a burst of 15 bullets through the Nieuport's wings and spars. Ball coaxed the Nieuport home for repairs, returning to battle in an S.E.5. In his third combat of the day, he fired five rounds before his machine gun jammed. After landing to clear the gun, he took off once more, surprising five Albatros fighters and sending one down in flames. His fifth battle, shortly thereafter, appeared inconclusive, as the enemy plane managed to land safely. However, its observer had been mortally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 169–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.&amp;nbsp;A4850, and one more on 28 April. This last day's fighting left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages=172–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an [[Albatros D.III]] fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trenches&quot;/&gt; The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot it out in a head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages=190–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While squadron armourers and mechanics repaired the faulty machine-gun [[Synchronization gear#The Constantinesco synchronization gear|synchroniser]] on his most recent S.E.5 mount, A8898, Ball had been sporadically flying the Nieuport again, and was successful with it on 6&amp;nbsp; May, destroying one more Albatros D.III in an evening flight to raise his tally to 44. He had continued to undertake his habitual lone patrols, but had of late been fortunate to survive. The heavier battle damage that Ball's aircraft were now suffering bore witness to the improved team tactics being developed by his German opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages=181–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time on 6 May, Ball had visited his friend Billy Bishop at the latter's aerodrome. He proposed that the pair attack the [[Manfred von Richthofen|Red Baron]]'s squadron at its airfield at dawn, catching the German pilots off guard. Bishop agreed to take part in the daring scheme at the end of the month, after he returned from his forthcoming leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;Civilised Warfare pp.254-256&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|title=The Dream of Civilised Warfare|pages=254–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; That night, in his last letter to his father, Ball wrote &quot;I do get tired of always living to kill, and am really beginning to feel like a murderer. Shall be so pleased when I have finished&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Billière|title= Supreme Courage |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final flight and aftermath ===
[[File:2106-21LastFlightof CaptainBall.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|''The Last Fight of Captain Ball, VC, DSO and 2 Bars, MC, 7 May 1917'' by [[Norman G. Arnold|Norman Arnold]], 1919 |alt=An aerial view of a dogfight between one British and three German aircraft. To the left one plane plummets streaming a trail of grey smoke behind. Below lies the faint outline of fields and lakes on the ground.]]
On the evening of 7 May 1917, near [[Douai]], 11 British aircraft from No.&amp;nbsp;56 Squadron led by Ball in an S.E.5 encountered German fighters from ''[[Jasta&amp;nbsp;11]]''. A running dogfight in deteriorating visibility resulted, and the aircraft became scattered.  [[Cecil Arthur Lewis]], a participant in this fight, described it in his memoir ''Sagittarius Rising''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title= Albert Ball VC |pages= 196–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball was last seen by fellow pilots pursuing the red Albatros D.III of the Red Baron's younger brother, [[Lothar von Richthofen]], who eventually landed near [[Annœullin]] with a punctured fuel tank. [[Cyril Crowe]] observed Ball flying into a dark thundercloud. A German pilot officer on the ground, Lieutenant Hailer, then saw Ball's plane falling upside-down from the bottom of the cloud, at an altitude of {{convert|200|ft|m}}, with a dead prop.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowyer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title= Albert Ball VC |pages= 208–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brothers Franz and Carl Hailer and the other two men in their party were from a German reconnaissance unit, ''Flieger-Abteilung A292''. Franz Hailer noted, &quot;It was leaving a cloud of black smoke... caused by oil leaking into the cylinders.&quot;  The engine had to be inverted for this to happen. The Hispano engine was known to flood its [[inlet manifold]] with fuel when upside down and then stopped running. Franz Hailer and his three companions hurried to the crash site.  Ball was already dead when they arrived.  The four German airmen agreed that the crashed craft had suffered no battle damage.  No bullet wounds were found on Ball's body, even though Hailer went through Ball's clothing to find identification. Hailer also took Ball to a field hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pengelly. ''Albert Ball VC: The Fighter Pilot Hero of World War I.'' pp.&amp;nbsp;196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; A German doctor subsequently described a broken back and a crushed chest, along with fractured limbs, as the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 211–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Original Gravemarker of Albert Ball.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|alt=White cross bearing inscription ''In Luftkampf gefallen für sein Vaterland Engl. Flieger Hauptmann Albert Ball, Royal Flying Corps''|The original German marker erected at Ball's grave in Annoeullin]]
The Germans credited Richthofen with shooting down Ball, but there is some doubt as to what happened, especially as Richthofen's claim was for a [[Sopwith Triplane]], not an S.E.5, which was a biplane. Given the amount of propaganda the German High Command generated touting the younger Richthofen, a high-level decision may have been taken to attribute Ball's death to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title= Albert Ball VC |pages= 215–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable that Ball was not shot down at all, but had become disoriented and lost control during his final combat, the victim of a form of temporary [[vertigo]] that has claimed other pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Bowyer |title=Albert Ball VC |page = 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ball's squadron harboured hopes that he was a prisoner of war, and the British government officially listed him as &quot;missing&quot; on 18 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Bowyer |title=Albert Ball VC |page= 222}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was much speculation in the press; in France, the [[Havas]] news agency reported: &quot;Albert Ball, the star of aviators... has been missing since the 7th May. Is he a prisoner or has he been killed? If he is dead, he died fighting for his forty-fifth victory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Briscoe | last2 = Stannard|title=Captain Ball VC|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only at the end of the month that the Germans dropped messages behind Allied lines announcing that Ball was dead, and had been buried in Annoeullin with full military honours two days after he crashed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 212–14, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the grave of the man they dubbed &quot;the English Richthofen&quot;, the Germans erected a cross bearing the inscription ''In Luftkampf gefallen für sein Vaterland Engl. Flieger Hauptmann Albert Ball, Royal Flying Corps'' (&quot;Fallen in air combat for his fatherland English pilot Captain Albert Ball&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Billière|title= Supreme Courage |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |page = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball's death was reported world-wide in the press. He was lauded as the &quot;wonder boy of the Flying Corps&quot; in Britain's ''[[Sunday Dispatch|Weekly Dispatch]]'', the &quot;Ace of English Aces&quot; in Portugal, the &quot;''heroe aviador''&quot; in South America, and the &quot;super-airman&quot; in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Briscoe; Stannard|title=Captain Ball VC|pages=306–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June 1917, the ''London Gazette'' announced that he had received the Croix de Chevalier, ''[[Legion d'Honneur]]'' from the French government.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30110 |date=1 June 1917 |startpage=5451 |endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his &quot;most conspicuous and consistent bravery&quot; in action from 25 April to 6 May 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheLondon&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30122 |date=8 June 1917 |startpage=5702 |endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 1917, a memorial service was held for Ball in the centre of Nottingham at [[St Mary's Church, Nottingham|St Mary's Church]], with large crowds paying tribute as the procession of mourners passed by. Among those attending were Ball's father Albert, Sr. and brother Cyril, now also a pilot in the RFC; his mother Harriett, overwhelmed with grief, was not present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Billière|title=Supreme Courage|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball was posthumously promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 15 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30129 |date=12 June 1917 |startpage=5862 |endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Victoria Cross was presented to his parents by King George&amp;nbsp;V on 22 July 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;British and Empire Aces&quot;/&gt; The following year he was awarded a special medal by the Aero Club of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert Ball VC pp.192-195&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC|page = 269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Posthumous tributes ===

[[File:IWM ART 002628AlbertBall1919.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Posthumous portrait of Ball by Edward Newling, 1919]]
In 1918, Walter A. Briscoe and H. Russell Stannard released a seminal biography, ''Captain Ball VC'', reprinting many of Ball's letters and prefaced with [[encomium]]s by Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]], and Major General Sir Hugh Trenchard. Lloyd George wrote that &quot;What he says in one of his letters, 'I hate this game, but it is the only thing one must do just now', represents, I believe, the conviction of those vast armies who, realising what is at stake, have risked all and endured all that liberty may be saved&quot;. Haig spoke of Ball's &quot;unrivalled courage&quot; and his &quot;example and incentive to those who have taken up his work&quot;.  In Trenchard's opinion, Ball had &quot;a wonderfully well-balanced brain, and his loss to the Flying Corps was the greatest loss it could sustain at that time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Briscoe; Stannard|title=Captain Ball VC|pages=vii–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book proper, Briscoe and Stannard quote Ball's most notable opponent, [[Manfred von Richthofen]]. The Red Baron, who believed in his younger brother's victory award, considered Ball &quot;by far the best English flying man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Briscoe; Stannard|title=Captain Ball VC|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in the book, an unidentified Royal Flying Corps pilot who flew with Ball in his last engagement was quoted as saying, &quot;I see they have given him the V.C. Of course he won it a dozen times over—the whole squadron knows that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Briscoe; Stannard|title=Captain Ball VC|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors themselves described the story of Ball's life as that of &quot;a young knight of gentle manner who learnt to fly and to kill at a time when all the world was killing... saddened by the great tragedy that had come into the world and made him a terrible instrument of Death&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 =Briscoe | last2 = Stannard|title=Captain Ball VC|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linda Raine Robertson, in ''The Dream of Civilised Warfare'', noted that Briscoe and Stannard  emphasised &quot;the portrait of a boy of energy, pluck, and humility, a loner who placed his skill in the service of his nation, fought&amp;nbsp;– indeed, invited&amp;nbsp;– a personal war, and paid the ultimate sacrifice as a result&quot;, and that they &quot;struggle to paste the mask of cheerful boyishness over the signs of the toll taken on him by the stress of air combat and the loss of friends&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|title=The Dream of Civilised Warfare|pages=248, 264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Clark]], in ''Aces High: The War in the Air Over the Western Front'', found Ball the &quot;perfect [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schoolboy]]&quot; with &quot;the enthusiasms and all the eager intelligence of that breed&quot; and that these characteristics, coupled with a lack of worldly maturity, were &quot;the ingredients of a perfect killer, where a smooth transition can be made between the motives that drive a boy to 'play hard' at school and then to 'fight hard' against the King's enemies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|title=Aces High|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Chaz Bowyer considered that &quot;to label Albert Ball a 'killer' would be to do him a grave injustice&quot;, as his &quot;sensitive nature suffered in immediate retrospect whenever he succeeded in combat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;For Valour&quot;/&gt;

After the war the British discovered Ball's grave, which had been behind enemy lines, in the Annoeullin Cemetery. In December 1918, personnel of [[No. 207 Squadron RAF]] erected a new cross in place of the one left by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |page= 220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial War Graves Commission (now [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]) were working at the time to consolidate the British war graves into fewer cemeteries; 23 British bodies in graves in the location where Ball was buried were moved to the Cabaret Rouge British Cemetery, but at his father's request Ball's grave was allowed to remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Gibson; Kingsley Ward|title=Courage Remembered|chapter=Victoria Cross and George Cross recipients who died in the war periods|page= 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowyer227&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages= 227–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Sr. paid for a private memorial to be erected over Ball's grave, No. 643, in what later became the Annoeullin Communal Cemetery and German Extension. Ball's is the only British grave from the First World War in this extension, the rest being German.&lt;ref name=Bowyer227/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=321879 |title=Casualty Details: Ball, Albert|publisher=The Commonwealth War Graves Commission|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball's father also bought the French field where his son had died and erected a memorial stone on the crash site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowyer|title=Albert Ball VC |pages = 227–28, 235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorials to Ball in his native Nottingham include a monument and statue in the grounds of [[Nottingham Castle]]. The monument, which was commissioned by the city council and funded by public subscription,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenton&quot; /&gt; consists of a bronze group on a carved pedestal of Portland stone and granite.

* '''Victoria Cross'''

{{quote|Lt. (temp. Capt.) Albert Ball, D.S.O., M.C., late Notts. and Derby. R., and R.F.C.

For most conspicuous and consistent bravery from the 25th of April to the 6th of May, 1917, during which period Capt. Ball took part in twenty-six combats in the air and destroyed eleven hostile aeroplanes, drove down two out of control, and forced several others to land.

In these combats Capt. Ball, flying alone, on one occasion fought six hostile machines, twice he fought five and once four. When leading two other British aeroplanes he attacked an enemy formation of eight. On each of these occasions he brought down at least one enemy.

Several times his aeroplane was badly damaged, once so seriously that but for the most delicate handling his machine would have collapsed, as nearly all the control wires had been shot away. On returning with a damaged machine he had always to be restrained from immediately going out on another.

In all, Capt. Ball has destroyed forty-three German aeroplanes and one balloon, and has always displayed most exceptional courage, determination and skill.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheLondon&quot; /&gt;}}

* '''Distinguished Service Order (DSO)'''

{{Quote|For conspicuous gallantry and skill. Observing seven enemy machines in formation, he immediately attacked one of them and shot it down at 15 yards range. The remaining machines retired. Immediately afterwards, seeing five more hostile machines, he attacked one at about 10 yards range and shot it down, flames coming out of the fuselage. He then attacked another of the machines, which had been firing at him, and shot it down into a village, when it landed on the top of a house. He then went to the nearest aerodrome for more ammunition, and, returning, attacked three more machines, causing them to dive under control. Being then short of petrol he came home. His own machine was badly shot about in these fights.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt;}}

* '''Distinguished Service Order (DSO) Bar'''

{{Quote|For conspicuous skill and gallantry. When on escort duty to a bombing raid he saw four enemy machines in formation. He dived on to them and broke up their formation, and then shot down the nearest one, which fell on its nose. He came down to about 500 feet to make certain it was wrecked. On another occasion, observing 12 enemy machines in formation, he dived in among them, and fired a drum into the nearest machine, which went down out of control. Several more hostile machines then approached, and he fired three more drums at them, driving down another out of control. He then returned, crossing the lines at a low altitude, with his machine very much damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO Bar&quot;/&gt;}}

* '''Distinguished Service Order (DSO) Bar'''

{{Quote|For conspicuous gallantry in action. He attacked three hostile machines and brought one down, displaying great courage and skill. He has brought down eight hostile machines in a short period, and has forced many others to land.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO 2nd Bar&quot;/&gt;}}

* '''Military Cross (MC)'''

{{Quote|For conspicuous skill and gallantry on many occasions, notably when, after failing to destroy an enemy kite balloon with bombs, he returned for a fresh supply, went back and brought it down in flames. He has done great execution among enemy aeroplanes. On one occasion he attacked six in one flight, forced down two and drove the others off. This occurred several miles over the enemy's lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt;}}
