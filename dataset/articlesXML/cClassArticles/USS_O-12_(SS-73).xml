'''USS ''O-12'' (SS-73)''' was an [[United States O class submarine|''O''-class submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]]. Her keel was laid down on 6 March 1916 by the [[Lake Torpedo Boat Company]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].

These later O-boats, ''O-11'' through ''O-16'', were designed by Lake Torpedo Boat to different specifications than the earlier Electric Boat designs. They performed poorly as compared to the Electric Boat units, and are sometimes considered a separate class.

''O-12'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 29 September 1917, sponsored by Mrs. Homer S. Cummings, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 18 October 1918 with Lieutenant Commander J.E. Austin in command.

== Military career ==
''O-12'' spent much of her career as a unit of Submarine Division 1, based at [[Coco Solo]], [[Panama Canal Zone]]. In 1921, she was awarded a Battle Efficiency Pennant and trophy for gunnery (gun and torpedo). She decommissioned on 17 June 1924 after just five and a half years of service, and was placed in reserve at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard|Philadelphia Navy Yard]].

== ''Nautilus'' Arctic Expedition ==
Struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 29 July 1930, ex-''O-12'' transferred to the [[United States Shipping Board]] for conversion by the Philadelphia Navy Yard.  She was leased at the rate of one dollar per year to [[Lake and Danenhower]], Inc., of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], for use on [[Hubert Wilkins]]'s and [[Lincoln Ellsworth]]'s Arctic Expedition of geophysical investigation. The lease required that she either be returned to the Navy for disposal, or scuttled in at least {{convert|1200|ft|m}} of water.

On 24 March 1931, she was re-christened '''''Nautilus'''''.  As [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] prevented the use of an alcoholic beverage, she was baptised not with the traditional [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] but rather with a bucket of ice cubes. Great French writer [[Jules Verne]]'s grandson was present at the event, under the French flag, along of course with Sir Hubert's young and glamorous new-wed wife, actress [[Suzanne Bennett]].

[[Simon Lake]] equipped ''Nautilus'' with several clever devices for under-ice operations.  One was a mechanical probe, much like a [[trolley pole]], that would scrape along the bottom of the ice cap to indicate how much clearance the submarine had below the ice.  Others included drills supposedly capable of cutting through {{convert|13|ft|m|0}} of ice to reach fresh air.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ycDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39 &quot;Polar Sub Can Drill Through Ice&quot;, April 1931, Popular Science] cutaway drawing&lt;/ref&gt;  These innovations were tested only cursorily before the boat put to sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;&gt;McLaren, Alfred S., CAPT USN &quot;Under the Ice in Submarines&quot; ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' July 1981 pp.105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nautilus'' with her crew of 20 men was commanded by Captain [[Sloan Danenhower]], son of [[John Wilson Danenhower]], who served aboard {{USS|Jeannette|1878|6}} during her Arctic expedition. ''Nautilus'', on 4 June 1931, began the crossing from [[New York City]], United States, to [[Plymouth]], England, the first leg of the voyage that was planned to take them up the coasts of the [[North Sea]] to [[Spitsbergen]] and conclude with a dramatic rendezvous at the [[North Pole]] with the German airship ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]''.  On that first leg, however, ''Nautilus'' encountered a violent storm.  Both engines failed, leaving the boat adrift.  She was rescued and initially towed into Cork Harbour in Southern Ireland on 22 June where her batteries were re-charged,&lt;ref&gt;Cork Examiner 23 June 1931&lt;/ref&gt; before being towed to England by {{USS|Wyoming|BB-32}} where she was repaired.

On 5 August, very late in the year to begin an Arctic expedition, ''Nautilus'' began making her way through the [[English Channel]] and along the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coast.  Another storm again damaged the boat, carrying away her bridge and giving her a permanent list, but after a stop in [[Tromsø]] on 11 August, she successfully reached Spitsbergen, and Wilkins allowed but a single day for repairs.

The crew carried out the planned scientific experiments as they pushed on northward, but thick [[pack ice]] hindered their progress. The boat was ill-equipped to deal with the extreme cold, lacking insulation and heaters.  The fresh water system froze and the hull developed slow leaks.

After ten days, ''Nautilus'' reached [[82nd parallel north|82°N]], the farthest north any vessel had reached under its own power, and preparations began to dive and proceed under the ice.  However, the boat refused to respond; the stern planes had been carried away at some unknown earlier time.  Without them, the submarine could not control its depth while submerged, and the expedition had to be aborted.

On 31 August, under financial pressure from [[William Randolph Hearst]], who indicated by telegraph that Wilkins would not be paid if he did not continue, Wilkins ordered the submarine onward.  Captain Danenhower ordered ''Nautilus'' trimmed down by the bow, and deliberately rammed an ice floe in an attempt to force the boat under.  The manoeuvre worked in that ''Nautilus'' submerged, and became the first submarine to operate under the polar ice cap.  However, her unconventional method of diving caused significant damage to her upper works.  She was out of radio contact for days, was presumed lost, and rescue efforts were planned. In fact, she had actually travelled only a short distance under the ice before resurfacing through a [[polynya]], but her radios had been badly damaged, requiring days to repair.

The scientific crew continued their experiments, and their findings became the first paper published by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]].  On 20 September, ''Nautilus'' returned to Spitsbergen carrying invaluable data and with all crew alive.  Hearst, however, considered the expedition a failure and carried out his threat, refusing to pay for the expedition.

== Ultimate Fate ==
Following the expedition, ''O-12'' was returned to the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]]. On 30 November 1931 she was towed three miles down the ''Byfjorden'' (a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[fjord]] just outside [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]]) and scuttled in {{convert|1138|ft|m}} of water.  In 1981 Norwegian divers found her wreck.

In 1959, {{USS|Skate|SSN-578}} was the first submarine to surface at the North Pole and the second submarine (after [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'' (SSN-571)]] in 1958)  to reach the North Pole.  Her crew conducted a tribute to Sir George Hubert Wilkins and scattered his ashes over the North Pole.
