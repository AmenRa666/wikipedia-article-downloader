==top==
This article does not give a fair description of the events of March 1988, nor of the political circumstances.  There is a better account at http://www.specialoperations.com/Counterterrorism/Operation_Flavius.html.
In particular, I am concerned that you state the inquest &quot;found that all three had been shot while laying face down on the ground&quot;  I can find no mention of this crucial detail elsewhere on the web; where is your source?  Otherwise, it should be removed.

== Death on the Rock ==
This article and the [[Death on the Rock]] article are practically identical, I suggest a merger and redirect. --[[User:Coroebus|Coroebus]] 09:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
:Personally, I think the ''Death on the Rock'' article is notable enough to deserve an article of its own. There is some overlap between the two articles, but that's not a major problem and is required to give the ''Death on the Rock'' article some context. [[User:Stumason|&lt;font color = &quot;green&quot;&gt;'''Stu'''&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Stumason|&lt;font color = &quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''’Bout ye!''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 10:33, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
::It would be if the articles were not essentially exactly the same. --[[User:Coroebus|Coroebus]] 10:41, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

:::I think its good to have them seperate, the incident was important as was the attempt to supress an ill informed bit of TV journalism.  The solution is to expand the two topics in different ways.  One thing that is not mentioned is that Channel 4 did a reconstruction of the inquest.  I have that somewhere on VHS. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 19:35, 16 June 2006 (UTC)


==Further Detail==

Someone added the following to the [[Mairéad Farrell]] page. I feel it is too specific and would be better suited here. However, the language appears to be pidgin-esque and requires a good deal of editing to be fit for inclusion. It also seems to lack any sources. (Copyright issues?)


The (British) intelligence service was now convinced that the bombing would take place on Tuesday 8 March, yet while the Joint Operations Centre was deliberating, there was still no sign that either (Danny) McCann or (Sean) Savage was getting ready to leave Belfast. They knew the third member and commander of the team was a formidable woman called Mairead Farrell, they knew what the target was, they were pretty certain they knew the date, and they thought they knew exactly how the bombing would be carried out. So far the whole operation had been a staggering success; seldom before had the security forces been in such an enviable position. 
On the afternoon of Sunday 6 March the MI5 observer is enjoying a quiet cigarette in the main square when he comes face to face with a man in a pin-striped jacket and jeans whose photograph he is certain he has ben looking at all week. It is 2.30p.m. Sean Savage has arrived on the Rock. With a start the watcher turns, walks away and then on the surveillance radio net reports back to the joint operations room the possible sighting of Savage. At almost the same moment other watchers stationed at the border report that two persons answering the description of Farrell and McCann have entered Gibralter on foot and are making their way past the airport terminal towards the town centre. Meanwhile Savage has wandered back across the square to a Renault 5 parked in slot 2 with its to the wall and its boot facing into the area where the band halts at the end of its parade. He unlocks the car and fiddles with something inside for two or three minutes. No watcher is close enough to see what he is doing but the significance is obvious. The waiting is over.
The two SAS teams are now ready and awaiting instructions. Each soldier has brought with him from Hereford a 9mm Browning semi-automatic pistol, 9mm ammunition and empty magazines.
Suddenly the active service unit is in the square not a stones throw from the operations room. It is 2.50p.m. Farrell and McCann have joined Savage and all three walk along the line of parked cars. They stop and look at the Renault. Not for long but long enough to chill the MI5 watchers. Now there can be no doubt. Identification is positive and the time to strike has arrived. At 2.55 p.m. Colombo (Deputy Commissioner Gibralter Police) agrees to the arrest and, verbally for the moment, passes the civil power to Soldier F and the military. At that moment the three bombers turn away and head out of the square past Soldiers C and D. The soldiers report in with a positive identification and set off in pursuit. Soldier E in the operations room tells them to hold back. Control is once more with the police.
At 3.40 p.m. exactly the commissioner of police signs the document handing the power of arrest to the military.
He (Detective Constable Charles Huart Special Branch) gets on his motorbike and heads for (Gibralter) town. Suddenly on the corner are all three terrorists, whom he recognizes instantly. At that moment the three separate. Farrell and McCann continue to head north towards the border. Savage turns round and heads back the way he has just come.
In the words of Soldier A: &quot;As I was getting close to Farrell and McCann, McCann looked over his left shoulder. He looked over but his body did not turn. He was smiling at the time. I was behind him, approximately ten metres... he looked straight at me. We had eye to eye contact. We looked directly at each other. The smile went off McCann's face ...it is hard to describe but it is almost like McCann had realized who I actually was ...I was just about to shout a warning to stop and at the same time I was drawing my pistol. I went to say &quot;Stop&quot; ...I don't know if it actually came out. I honestly don't know. He looked at me and all of a sudden his right arm, his right elbow, moved, in what I deemed an agressive action, across the front of his body. I thought Mad McCann was definately going for the button. To me the whole worry was the bomb in the assembly area.&quot;
Soldier A, knowing that McCann is considered to be the IRA's greatest exponent of close quarter combat, now has his browning in his hand and fires one round into McCann's back. He sees Farrell out of the corner of his eye &quot;going for her bag&quot;. By now the two soldiers are just three metre away from the bombers. Soldier A assumes Farrell is going for the button. He shoots her in the back and then shoots McCann three more times, one in the back, two in the head. In all, A fires five times.
Soldier B is concentrating on Farrell. He draws his own gun as Farrell draws a large shoulder bag across her body. &quot;In my mind she made all the actions to carry out the detonation of a radio-controlled device... I fired one or two shots at Farrell and then switched fire to McCann... in all seven shots.&quot;
Soldier C fires four rounds to the chest and two the head. Soldier D fires nine rounds. In all, Savage is hit no less than fifteen times.
At 4.06 p.m. soldier F hands over control of the military operation on the colony back to the police commissioner. The military operation has been running for just twenty-six minutes. Three of the IRA's most ruthless operatives are dead.
By a majority of nine to two the (inquest) verdict was lawful killing.


[[User:GiollaUidir|GiollaUidir]] 17:17, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

:wrong spelling of Gibraltar, My understanding was that all three were leaving Gibraltar at the time, not moving towards the town center.  The reference to 'the main square' is bollocks as the bomb and holding car were parked further south.  This sounds like a sensationalised version taken from a popular paperback about the SAS.

:The terrorists had been spotted in Spain and tracked by the Spanish intelligence services, who declined to attend the inquest, but it is believed co-operated fully with the British.

:The detail can be found in the ECHR review.  A link is given on the page.
--[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 22:02, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

Theres a lot of overlap between the various entries in Wikipedia about this incident.  Currently all of them are fairly accurate, based on the report of the ECHR, which included the evidence presented at the inquest.  Probably because of the interest at the time, this was not published and was available for an outrageous fee per page, Channel 4 bought a copy and did a full reconstruction of the inquest. This was believed to be the closest thing apart from televising the actual proceedings.  I could not find the ECHR report online so created a .pdf of the copy downloaded from their website and anyone interested in the details should read that rather than the sensationalised accounts in paperback form.  I've added some photographs of the locations taken recently - they are much as they were then except there were more cars parked in front of the bank then.  I used to watch the band assembling and think about the possibility of someone planting a bomb, sadly others did too.

--[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]]

==Keep it real==

The intention of the PIRA was to blow up the bandsmen, there was evidence they were in possession of semtex, detonators and timing devices.  There were experienced and had no regard for human life.  The Inquest determined that was their purpose, the independent ECHR review confirmed it, and the IRA issued a statement that they were 'on active service' - so lets not introduce any doubt in their purpose and resolve. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 23:59, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

* The were killed before they took any action! They could have aborted the mission, got cold feet and decided not to carry it out or anything - we will never know! What we do know is the SAS killed 3 unarmed people on the bias and ALL of them reached for their pockets even though they were actually carrying nothing! The implication being that they all made the story up once they got back to the barracks. [[User:Vintagekits|Vintagekits]] 00:22, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

::They were lawfully killed, not murdered.  That was the verdict of the inquest. You are free to imagine whatever you like, but there is no evidence. There was evidence of explosives and given the past history of the team they were fully committed. You might want to add some extra material describing how the PIRA bravely shot the ex-Governor of Gibraltar in the head whilst he was enjoying his retirement. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 01:03, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Since they were immediately killed, they had no chance to defend themselves so we don't know what their personal intentions were.  Meanwhile, since the British government had infiltrated the PIRA with numerous spys - including bomb experts - we don't know how reliable the evidence was against them.  Do we?  See the following references regarding just some of the 'outed' British spys within the PIRA: [http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200603u/stakeknife Matthew Teague talks about &quot;Double Blind,&quot; his extraordinary profile of a double agent who helped undermine the IRA], [http://www.counterpunch.org/browne05292003.html 'Stakeknife' The Story of Britain's Army Spy at the Top of the IRA], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4877516.stm Sinn Fein British agent shot dead]  Because of the infiltration with bomb expert spys into the PIRA, no one will ever know what [[false flag]] operations were carried out by the British spys - rather than any PIRA members.[[User:Bcsurvivor|Bcsurvivor]] 02:09, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

::::There are few things in this life that we can be totally sure about, in relation to this incident everybody lied in places, however the idea is to present the official record and things that are evidenced rather than wild assumptions lacking any substance.

::::There is reason to believe that the 'Gibraltar three' were bad people and that their elimination preserved the lives of many others, in that context I think the People of Gibraltar are due an official apology from the IRA for the attempt - which they have already acknowledged they maed - and that a line should be drawn under the matter and that we all move on.  --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 09:59, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

:Who determines what is an &quot;illegal paramilitary organisation&quot;?  King George of England believed that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and all of the other U.S. Patriots were members of an &quot;illegal paramilitary organisation&quot; and they would have been hung as traitors if King George could have managed to capture them.  They may even have been [[drawn and quartered]] like the Irish Patriots of 1798.[[User:Bcsurvivor|Bcsurvivor]] 02:30, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

::Currently its [http://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ the UN] However, I believe the IRA has been an illegal organisation according to the laws of Ireland for some time. My pal with a degree in history says you are wrong about 1798.

::Nobody denies that they were in Gibraltar to detonate a large bomb, so consider them 'casualties of war' like the attack on Sir Peter Terry, who was believed to have been playing golf in Spain when the original shooting occured. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]]

:::The links with Gibraltar and Ireland are good, indeed we are twinned with Ballymena where a number of Gibraltarians were evacuated during WW2, the Irish here are well integrated and liked. Our situation is rather different as the indigenous population is both British, Catholic, self-governing, and united before making crass comments you need to be better informed.

:::I was in Dublin the day of the Omagh atrocity and shared the shock with the people there.  There is nothing to be admired from this sort of activity and those who came to Gibraltar intending to murder and maim innocent people received swift justice.  Its history, leave it alone. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]]

==Allegations==
Sorry, the allegations against Siobhan O'Hanlon shouldn't be included.

It's like having a link to An Phoblact stating Ian Paisley was involved in Greysteel.([[User:Irish Republican|Irish Republican]] 17:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC))

:I'd agree with that. If there was a fourth member it could be anyone. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 18:38, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

==Radio evidence/claims==

I think all the various radio evidence needs to be in one place, as at the moment there are competing &quot;claims&quot; in ''Death on the Rock'', the inquest, and the European Court. In fact, it takes up most of the inquest section, which needs more detail in itself. [[User:Nick Cooper|Nick Cooper]] 19:43, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

I'd agree there should be more information about the inquest, however the only published material is that reproduced in the ECHR review, unless you can get hold of a transcript of the Channel four reconstruction.

On the radio evidence, radio propagation around the rock is rather strange and the limited tests done by both camps are best described as RUBBISH.  I watched the Army people doing theirs. Although I'm not saying Scott lied, he was very economical with the truth. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]]
:In 1979 the IRA had used a radio controlled bomb in the [[Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma#Death|Mountbatten bombing]], so surely they were at least as capable, if not more so, 9 years later in 1988? Radio detonation was used the same day at the [[Warrenpoint ambush]] and the [[Enniskillen bombing]] in 1987. How did it even become an issue at the Gibraltar hearings?[[Special:Contributions/86.44.214.41|86.44.214.41]] ([[User talk:86.44.214.41|talk]]) 20:37, 21 May 2010 (UTC)

==MI6 involvement==
For those who did not know at this point, exMI6 agent [[Richard Tomlinson]] has edited the list of MI6 he previously released and the MI6 responsibilities for Operation Flavius apppear attributed to:

:&lt;b&gt;Michael Charles RAMSCAR&lt;/b&gt; 
:DOB: 1948	
:POSTINGS: 77 Lagos, 79 Brasilia, 86 Madrid, 89 San Jose, 97 Madrid

Tomlinsons credentials as exMI6 are not disputed afaik. A gagging order was also previously issued to try and prevent dissemination of the list alongside all his other legal woes. With these things in mind i'm wondering if the detail Tomlinson alleges can be included in the article even though it was published on his blog? 

I have not read on the subject of Flavius so cannot say if the naming of Ramscar is a confirmation of previously alleged information or something new. Either way its some detail that doesn't appear in the article presently so might be worth including without infringing WP:OR.

==ECHR==

The ECHR reviewed the technical evidence presented at the Gibraltar inquest, they did not add to it.  As the transcript of the inquest is not freely available, I believe they charged 5 quid a page, publication by the ECHR is a reliable source of the nonsense that went on. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 10:08, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
:By definition it was disputed, that's why it was reviewed. &lt;font face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;[[User:One Night In Hackney|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#009&quot;&gt;One Night In Hackney&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;''[[User talk:One Night In Hackney|303]]''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 08:25, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

Vintagekits: If you want to say the ECHR '''disputed''' the evidence presented at the inquest you need to substantiate that claim. They reviewed the evidence and came to conclusions.  It may be you believe the evidence was rubbish, it may be that I think a lot of it was lies and fabrication from both camps, but neither of us are ECHR judges and its the record of that hearing which matters not our opinions.

The verdict was disputed by the families of the terrorists for political purposes, thats all. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 08:32, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

The reference is to paragraph 114

''114. The applicants called Dr Scott, who held a masters degree and doctorate in engineering and was a licensed radio operator. He had been involved in two IRA trials in England. He had conducted tests with similar receivers along the route taken by the three suspects.''

This is the evidence given at the inquest. 

The evidence is contradictory, but the ECHR did not rule on that, or dispute any of it, even Dr Scott who was economical with the truth. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 08:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

:Please try reading what you are reverting and saying - &quot;this was further disputed '''at''' the European Court&quot;.  Nobody is saying the ECHR disputed it, but by definition it was disputed '''at''' the ECHR. &lt;font face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;[[User:One Night In Hackney|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#009&quot;&gt;One Night In Hackney&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;''[[User talk:One Night In Hackney|303]]''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 08:51, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::The reference is specifically to the radio evidence and that was NOT disputed, it was reviewed. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 10:16, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

The '''radio evidence'''  referenced was provided by the Irish Radio expert so you are 'disputing' that ?  Confused. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] 21:44, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

Sir, if, as has been suggested above, you would take more care in reading the wording of the section you keep reverting, you would see that what is being stated is that evidence and statements were disputed '''at''' the ECHR---not that the ECHR disputed said evidence, but rather that the applicants disputed it.  It was the ''disputation'' on the part of the applicants that led to the court's ''review''.  Please see the following:

:4. Further material submitted by the applicants 

:131. The applicants also submitted a further opinion of Dr Scott, dated 22 October 1993, in which he reiterated his view that it would have been impossible for the three suspects to have detonated a bomb in the target area from the location where they were shot using an ICOM or any other conceivable concealable transmitter/aerial combination, which he maintains must have been well known to the authorities. He also drew attention to the fact that the strength of a hand held transmitter is severely attenuated when held close to the human body; when transmitting it should be held well clear of the body with the aerial as high as possible.

The article says &quot;The SAS team was incorrectly informed that the IRA had already placed their bomb and were ready to detonate it.&quot;

As far as I'm aware, that is not correct.  The person who examined the parked car briefly said he reported it as a suspected car bomb;  and when asked in court what he meant by tnat, he explained it meant he could not rule out the possibility there was a bomb in the car.

==POV statement==

I question the inclusion of the Paragraph

''Fr Raymond Murray, author of The SAS in Ireland (1990), has described the SAS as an assassination squad, like the South American death squads, who, acting outside the law, have killed persons when they have had the opportunity of arresting them. He also says they are well known &quot;for shooting wounded and incapacitated persons lying helpless on the ground.&quot; ''

Its pretty clear the SAS do not operate in that manner and specifically did not in Gibraltar and the inclusion of that very POV quote would be rather like someone including the opinion of [[Norman Tebbit]] about the IRA which is equally unflattering.  If there is evidence that the SAS do that sort of thing, lets see news reports of it and not just a prejudiced unsubstantiated opinion.

::I think you know that looking for reports that people do not do something is a rather weak argument.  If you are saying that all news reports are biased then as Wikipedia is largely based on such things, the whole concept is flawed.  All I am saying is that including rampant propaganda and the personal unsubstantiated opinion of someone is not productive in describing events of a historical nature. Indeed his claim is probably based on the flawed view that 'innocent people' were shot on the streets of Gibraltar by the SAS which we know was not the case, a view supported by the inquest verdict. --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] ([[User talk:Gibnews|talk]]) 09:21, 15 February 2009 (UTC)


I agree, if Wikipedia is largely based on biased news reports the whole concept is flawed. However, it is not! We also have authors who have spent time in researching the subject, which can not be just dismissed as &quot;rampant propaganda&quot; and &quot;unsubstantiated opinion&quot; without any supporting evidence. --&lt;font face=&quot;Celtic&quot;&gt;[[User:Domer48|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#009900&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domer48&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;''[[User talk:Domer48|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006600&quot;&gt;'fenian'&lt;/span&gt;]]''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 11:19, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

:Its a pity that your author has chosen to come of with defamatory weasel words, however, there is no shortage of material describing the IRA in less than flattering terms for murdering innocent civilians, as they proposed to do in Gibraltar, nor for that matter articles describing SAS bravery.  Can I suggest politely you tone down the language and keep to facts rather than propaganda.  --[[User:Gibnews|Gibnews]] ([[User talk:Gibnews|talk]]) 13:13, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

That sounds like some of &quot;rampant propaganda&quot; and &quot;unsubstantiated opinion&quot; without any supporting evidence we mentioned above.

:Use of the phrase 'colonial outposts' sounds like you want to be offensive and does not apply to Gibraltar which long ceased being 'a colony'.  [[The Gibraltar Chronicle]] is the second oldest newspaper in the world and has a commensurate reputation.

The Gibraltar Chronicle does not come anywhere remotely near being the second oldest newspaper in the world, there are dozens of still published journals very much older, but even if it was, age alone does not make it a reliable source.

:Gibraltar is not a 'colonial outpost' any more than Dublin.  As regards the Gibraltar Chronicle headline, that sounds a reasonable description. Which part do you think is wrong?  Unlike the UK newspapers '''the story''' did not specifically state that there was a bomb: 

:''British troops evacuated the whole area surrounding the Inces Hall where a car believed to contain a large bomb was being dealt with by bomb disposal experts.'' ... ''At a press conference held in, the Convent yesterday afternoon British officials, controlling all information, stated that UK forces were supporting the police and that the three people killed were suspected terrorists. People who were in the area of the shooting say that there were at least seven shots and a young man who saw the bodies of the man and woman close up says that both had their faces disfigured by the shots. The car was towed away and there has been no confirmation of the story that it held 500 pounds of explosives.''

Previous discussion at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Terrorism/Archive 3#Use of national flags to represent non-state paramilitary/terrorist groupings]]. Nothing new really brought up here. The tricolor is verifiabily the flag of Irish republicanism and the IRA, and its use pre-dates any adoption by any other Irish state. It did not cease to be the flag of Irish republicanism at any point, [[Take It Down from the Mast|particuarly not when adopted by the Free State]]. Any arguments about illegality are specious. Are you going to remove the Confederate flag from American Civil War articles? Or the Stars and Stripes from American Revolutionary War articles? Plenty of non-state (although the whole point is that the IRA aren't non-state, more acting on behalf of an unrecognised state) actors have flags, should they all be removed because they aren't &quot;legal&quot;? I've no real preference for both flags versus no flags, but having only one flag is POV. &lt;font face=&quot;Celtic&quot;&gt;[[User:One Night In Hackney|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006600&quot;&gt;2 lines of K&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;''[[User talk:One Night In Hackney|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006600&quot;&gt;303&lt;/span&gt;]]''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 14:04, 31 October 2011 (UTC)

==Background==
I am making some changes to the first few sentences of this section. Firstly, if we say that the IRA was a paramilitary organisation that aimed to get the British out of Northern Ireland though the use of force, it adds nothing to say that they were &quot;considered by the British to be terrorists&quot;; there's a bit of a &quot;d'uh!&quot; factor there. Secondly, it's not accurate to say that they split ''from'' the Official IRA: Officials and Provisionals were the two products of a split ''within'' the IRA. I'm putting in a different source for that: Bishop and Mallie's ''The Provisional IRA''. I'm also linking the Provisional IRA, because it's the beginning of the article proper, and a long way from the link at the start of the lead. Finally, I thought &quot;bombing and shooting of businesses&quot; sounded very stange, so I am re-ordering the wording in that sentence.  [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]] ([[User talk:Scolaire|talk]]) 13:24, 9 February 2014 (UTC)

:Works for me. I thought the &quot;considered [...] to be a terrorist organisation&quot; was worth including, because the British approach to Flavius was one counter-terrorism rather than an operation against an opposing military, but i you think it goes without saying, I'll go along with that. As to linking, some people believe very passionately that no article should contain two links to the same place, but my general rule is once in the lead and once in the body.

::: &quot;Partial rv&quot; (actually almost entire rv) re my last edit by HJ Mitchell is borderline censorship and should be explained and discussed on talk page. Mentioning only police and Army as opposed to the whole litany of victims -- reservists, politicians, judges, WWII veterans, loyalists, alleged informers, etc -- is a disservice to the article and to the truth. If you rv references to the creation of the PIRA from the 1960s split in the IRA as a whole, then we can maybe remove some extraneous details, but otherwise how else to distinguish between PIRA as compared to OIRA, from which it split? [[User:Rms125a@hotmail.com|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;'''''Quis separabit?'''''&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:15, 10 February 2014 (UTC)
 
::::I have no objection to the whole range of IRA activity being included. I also thought that &quot;police or military patrols&quot; was a bit bare. I do think that the list could be ordered a bit better, though; at the moment it looks kind of thrown together. I don't think suspected informers should be there, either. While the IRA did undoubtedly kill them, it couldn't really be said to have been part of their strategy i.e. how they &quot;pursued their aims&quot;. I also think &quot;to intimidate opponents and drain the British Exchequer&quot; is a bit hyperbolic, and could do with clarification as well as toning down.
::::I've added half a sentence to distinguish Provisionals from Officials.  [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]] ([[User talk:Scolaire|talk]]) 14:20, 11 February 2014 (UTC)

::::I would also have concerns about sourcing. The CAIN page linked to gives a lot of statistics about violence, but does not say that this is the way the IRA &quot;pursued their aims&quot;. The other source, Urban's ''Big Boys' Rules'', is the source that was used for the previous, much shorter sentence. I would like to know exactly what that book says on pages 32-34. [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]] ([[User talk:Scolaire|talk]]) 21:54, 12 February 2014 (UTC)
::::::::: ''&quot;It pursued its aims through the killing, by shooting and bombings...&quot;'' was formerly ''&quot;The IRA attempted to achieve its aims through bombing and shooting ...&quot;''&lt;br&gt; I guess I don't see much difference.

::::: I may have misconsolidated something, but I do trust and rely on CAIN implicitly. These links I added to the text should be informative (http://www.cain.ulst.ac.uk/victims/introduction/smcd07whoarethevictims.html, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8351344.stm, http://www.cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/book/index.html#append). If there is anything you object to as inaccurate or untrue, then please feel free to rectify. Also, I added some info to the background section re splinter groups since you pointed out that the OIRA ceased activity in the 1970s but the PIRA was not the only republican group active since that time. But if this added info is too tangential or better placed elsewhere then feel free to remove.

::::::I think you misread what I said. I didn't say that CAIN was not reliable, I said that I couldn't see anything on the page to back up the assertion that &quot;It ''pursued its aims'' through the killing, by shooting and bombings...&quot; Multiplying the refs doesn't help there. Indeed, it only adds to the confusion, because they're all very long pages, and I can't see what, specifically, you're citing. I'd still like if {{u|HJ Mitchell}} could tell me what the Urban book said. The other thing is, we don't need an ''exhaustive'' list of every kind of person that they killed. This is not the IRA article, it's an article on a very specific subject. So, rather than adding resident magistrates to the list, it would be better to summarise it as &quot;members of the police, military, prison system and judiciary, including off-duty and retired members.&quot;
::::::The info on other parmilitary groups is not needed. The Officials are only there because it confuses readers if you talk about a split without saying what the other half of the split was.  [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]] ([[User talk:Scolaire|talk]]) 11:14, 13 February 2014 (UTC)

::::::::[[User:Rms125a@hotmail.com|Rms125a@hotmail.com]], your accusations of &quot;subjective removal&quot; and &quot;censorship&quot; are outrageous and deeply offensive. I've spent hundreds of hours building this article up from the bare bones that it used to be, and I'm certainly not &quot;partial&quot; to either side of the debate, as I think the prose shows. It's extensively researched, and I've taken great care to back up controversial statements with solid references; I certainly have not sought to shy away from anything that one party or the other may find uncomfortable. However, not everything can be included—the article is already hovering around the 8,000-word mark, and many thousands more words have been written elsewhere about the events described in this article. The role of an encyclopaedia is to summarise the literature on the subject; that means there comes a point when you have to decide whether something is significant enough for inclusion and what weight to give it. If we didn't do that, this article could easily be three times the size it is, but the reader's understanding of the subject would be no deeper.&lt;p&gt;The background section in particular should be restrained—its purpose in an article like this is to help the reader understand who the main parties were and how they operated, ''as far as is relevant to the main subject''. We don't need a full history of the IRA (or indeed the SAS), much less Irish Republicanism, we have other articles that are far better equipped to inform readers on those subjects; we need enough so that a reader understands how the IRA came to plan a bomb attack in Gibraltar. I welcome—and have welcomed—edits that improve the article, but some of your edits have introduced more problems than they've solved. I've ''always'' assumed good faith and given you and your edits the benefit of the doubt; since I've known you were following edits to the article, I've used very clear edit summaries; and I have been friendly in interacting with you because my only interest is the best possible encyclopaedia article. You, on the other hand, have used ambiguous edit summaries, removed vital facts on the extremely dubious grounds of &quot;synthesis&quot; and &quot;speculation&quot; (on which points you seem not to fully understand the applicable policies) and you have repeatedly reinstated your edits after I have carefully fixed the problems without resorting to a wholesale revert, apparently without reading my edit summaries. I would appreciate it if you would show me the same courtesy I have shown you, and I would ask that you strike your accusation of censorship.

I don't have the book to hand right now, but I'll check it later and get you a quote tomorrow.

:::::::::I am removing the reference to the Good Friday Agreement. For one thing, the Agreement was in 1998, and the cessation of activity was in 2005, so the two are nor generally linked by commentators, except in so far as they were both part of the Peace Process; and for another, the GFA is not relevant to the events of 1988.

== Lead again ==

The lead is not too long for the length of the article, and could be expanded into four paragraphs. I think the second sentence of the first paragraph should be the first section of the second, as it begins the chronology of the event. The remainder of the first paragraph should talk about why the operation was controversial and the questions it raised – the use of lethal force, warnings, possible surrender, alleged conspiracy etc. – and make a brief mention of the Milltown killings and the corporals killings as well. This is the sort of information the reader will look for if, for instance, the first paragraph appears on the front page of Wikipedia some day.  [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]] ([[User talk:Scolaire|talk]]) 09:17, 14 February 2014 (UTC)
:I went for a three-paragraph lead just because I didn't want to overwhelm readers with what was already quite a long article, but there's scope to make it a bit longer if we think that's necessary. I would prefer to keep it in chronological order if possible, so perhaps a new paragraph between the second and first (as they are currently) would be better? By all means try something if you want; it'll be next week before I can do much.

::No, my point is that &quot;''Operation Flavius was a controversial military operation in which three members of the Provisional IRA were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar on 6 March 1988. From late 1987, the British authorities were aware that the IRA was planning to detonate a bomb...''&quot; does not flow. They should be in separate paragraphs.

The idea is to bring the key points up front to people unfamiliar with the topic, with a longer introduction in the rest of the lede. This is helpful because Wikipedia articles are often much longer than other encyclopedia articles - this is one of the more common criticisms of Wikipedia, that there's far too much detail and not enough overview.&quot; What I am proposing is to give the overview in the first paragraph, and the chronology from the second paragraph on.

::::I was thinking more along the lines of
::::*The three—[[Seán Savage]], [[Daniel McCann]], and [[Mairéad Farrell]]—were believed to be planning a bombing attack on British military personnel in Gibralter. SAS soldiers challenged them in the forecourt of a petrol station, then opened fire, killing them. All were found to be unarmed, and no bomb was discovered, leading to accusations that the British government had conspired to murder them. An inquest in Gibraltar ruled that the SAS had acted lawfully, while the [[European Court of Human Rights]] held that, although there had been no conspiracy, the planning and control of the operation was flawed. The deaths were the first in a chain of violent events in a fourteen-day period; they were followed by the [[Milltown Cemetery attack]] and the [[corporals killings]].
::::First of all, the three should be named and linked in the first paragraph, followed by the reason they were challenged, and the place they were challenged (thus explaining why the main image is one of a petrol station).

:Hi. Just wanted to let you know I reverted my last edit as I didn't wish to be in violation of [[WP:1RR|1RR]]. However, I believe the edit is salutary, and most certainly not tweaking for tweaking's sake. I believe the term &quot;judicial personnel&quot; is quite unclear, almost intentionally vague, whereas &quot;members of the judiciary&quot; is far clearer. 
:Anyway I don't want to get into any kind of edit war regarding good faith editing, so I wanted to know if you could look again (via edit history) at the rewording I used and let me know if you have any problem with it (and why) so I can TRY to reword it for mutual agreement, if possible.

Your edits, and your posts here and on my talk page, raise a number of questions:
#Why is the killing of judges so important, that it merits special mention. It's not as though the IRA targetted one judge a week for thirty years. Were judges the target of the planned operation in Gibralter? If not, why is there a specific need to emphasise the killing of judges ''in this article''? There are no fewer than three articles – [[The Troubles]], [[Provisional IRA]] and [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997]] – where this degree of detail is appropriate.
#Why would I be ''intentionally'' vague, given that I have already said that I have no objection to the whole range of IRA activity being included? I want to help Harry bring this article up to FA standard. Your use of that word, and the earlier use of the word &quot;censorship&quot;, directed at Harry, might suggest that you are less concerned with improving the article than with holding all the sins of the IRA up to the light of day. If we were not assuming good faith, that is. Let me just remind you that [[WP:SOAP|Wikipedia is not a soapbox]].
#In the light of the above questions, is &quot;judicial personnel&quot; really that much more unclear than &quot;members of the judiciary&quot;? And if clarity is so important, why have you now replaced &quot;members of the judiciary&quot; with &quot;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Flavius&amp;diff=595808092&amp;oldid=595771196 jurists]&quot;? That word had me scrambling for my Collins dictionary!
Having said all that, I would have no problem with changing &quot;military, police, judicial and prison personnel&quot; to &quot;members of the armed forces, police, judiciary and prison service&quot;. But I'll see what Harry thinks. He's the one that has taken the trouble to bring this article up to standard. When ''I'' say I don't want to get into any kind of edit war, I stop edit-warring. I'm not going to revert you again; I'll let you and Harry sort out the wording between you.  [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]] ([[User talk:Scolaire|talk]]) 09:02, 17 February 2014 (UTC)
:Gents, I've just made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Flavius&amp;diff=596080183&amp;oldid=595808092 this edit]. I'm not sure we need to mention the judiciary specifically, but if we are, that copy-edit was useful. RMS, the rest of your edits introduced various problems. For example, the articles uses &quot;IRA&quot; (not &quot;PIRA&quot;) as the abbreviation throughout; as I understand it, the latter was mainly used by the British Army, and &quot;IRA&quot; is used by all the sources and in [[Provisional IRA|the article on the organisation]]. Similarly, &quot;Volunteer&quot; is, I believe, a term mainly used by the IRA to describe its activists; even Eckert (who is otherwise apologetic for the IRA in many parts of his book) thinks the term portrays the IRA as &quot;social workers toting assault rifles&quot;—I've tended to avoid the term, in the same way that I've avoided words like &quot;terrorist&quot;.
:Above all, though, this is just ''background''—it's there to help the reader understand the history as it relates to the events described in the article; we have links to other articles ([[the Troubles]], [[Provisional IRA]], even [[Official IRA]] and [[Irish Republican Army (1922–69)]]) for those who want to know exactly what the IRA did during its campaign. I'll gladly concede that my original version wasn't perfect, and I'm entirely open to suggestions, but it's not meant to be a comprehensive list.

::I personally think it makes more sense, purely from the point of view of providing background to the events, if judges were not singled out, i.e. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Flavius&amp;oldid=595718208 this version] or the alternative I suggested above, but I said I would leave it to you, so I'll say no more.

:::[[User:Rms125a@hotmail.com|RMS]], Scolaire, what do you think of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Flavius&amp;diff=597435893&amp;oldid=597434991 this wording]? I'm also considering removing prison officers from the list, but I don't feel overly strongly if somebody wants to make an argument for their continued inclusion.

::::The original text said it &quot;attempted to achieve its aims through bombing and shooting of businesses and police or military patrols&quot;. This was subsequently clarified and extended, but the edit you link to leaves out the destruction of businesses altogether. We also had agreed that prison officers ''and'' judges were to be included as targets – my only objection to the previous edit was that it singled out judges for no apparent reason. Also, &quot;mainly in Northern Ireland and England&quot; is misleading. If you wanted to cover all your bases, you could say &quot;mainly in Northern Ireland, sometimes in England and to a lesser extent in other parts of Europe&quot;, but I think it's easier just to leave it as &quot;both in Northern Ireland and England&quot;.

:::::I'm not sure we really need the laundry list of different targets; for example, the targeted plenty of politicians and other establishment figures but they're not mentioned in the article. As far as background is concerned, I don't think police officers, prison officers, and judges are significantly more or less relevant than any other group. Military personnel are obviously relevant because Operation Flavius was concerned with an attempted bombing of a military parade; police officers I think I added originally to give some background (to avoid the impression that the IRA only attacked soldiers), and now we've got the laundry list. I think the judges were singled out for the sake of the prose rather than because they were more important. I agree that we should probably retain the destruction of businesses.

::::::&quot;Armed forces, police, judiciary and prison service&quot; is four items, seven words. I don't know how many items you send to the laundry at one time, but I certainly would not think of four items as a laundry list. It's a straightforward statement of how the IRA operated – which, if I understand correctly, is the purpose of the paragraph - and I don't see any benefit accruing from lopping off three words (the &quot;and&quot; will need to stay). As I said in the section above, this is your baby, and I feel no great need to oppose you. I can't help wondering though, if there aren't some [[WP:OWN|ownership]] issues here. However, do what you feel. I think I've contributed enough, and I'm going to unwatch this. Happy editing.  [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]] ([[User talk:Scolaire|talk]]) 00:34, 6 March 2014 (UTC)
:::::::Hi [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]], I hope you'll reconsider. Perhaps I've not been the easiest person to work with, and maybe I am a little protective, but my aim is to make this the best encyclopaedia article it can be, and I was quite enjoying working with you towards that aim. Your contributions thus far have been extremely valuable, and it's hard to overestimate the value of having people like you to discuss changes with and to challenge things if something is going wrong—this article would be much poorer if I were the only contributor.

::::::::Thanks, but I meant it when I said I think I've contributed enough. I never meant to be a major contributor; I just wanted to share my thoughts on two or three things, and now I've done that. I wish you all the best in your quest for FA status, and I'm sure someone else will come along and help with the other sections.

== Rms125a@hotmail.com subject to 0RR at this article ==

For continued disruption to this article, including gaming the 1RR restriction, I have imposed a [[WP:0RR]] restriction on [[user:Rms125a@hotmail.com]] at this article. If they make any reverts, whether explicitly marked as such or not, to this article they may be blocked without further warning.

== Citation format examples ==

A better example would be something like the [[WP:FA]] pages at:
#''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]''
#''[[El Señor Presidente]]''
#[[Mario Vargas Llosa]]

Hopefully these are some helpful examples from which to model references formatting sects.

Cheers,

==Lede too long?==
Is the &quot;lede&quot; not ridiculous right now? It's like a book...[[User:Frenchmalawi|Frenchmalawi]] ([[User talk:Frenchmalawi|talk]]) 00:18, 6 December 2014 (UTC)
:This is my suggestion for a radically shortened lede: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Flavius&amp;diff=636825705&amp;oldid=636823170]....[[User:Frenchmalawi|Frenchmalawi]] ([[User talk:Frenchmalawi|talk]]) 00:29, 6 December 2014 (UTC)
::Hi, leads are something I struggle with, but that's a little bit ''too'' drastic. It needs to adequately summarise the article but without going into excess detail. It's on the longer side of acceptable at the moment, and I'm certainly not averse to some pruning for readability if it goes into too much detail, but please bear in mind that this is a [[WP:FA|featured article]], and it's been through [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Operation Flavius/archive1|a lengthy review process]] to ensure it meets strict criteria. That doesn't mean it's perfect or that it can't be changed, just that a lot of people have had input on the way it is. I'll reply in more detail in the morning as it's getting on for 01:00!

:::It's ok. You don't need to spend any time justifying anything to me. I am not committed to this article the way you appear to be. You have my view - that it's ridiculous. To call it a lede is ridiculous. My view hasn't changed. Regardless of there having been a &quot;review process&quot;. I will drop out now. Best of luck with it.

==Some Interesting Stuff==
I contributed the following which includes some interesting stuff that isn't covered in the article presently (even though the article is extremely long). I reproduce it for those who may see merit in including all or any of the following (all sourced). My edit was reverted in about 5 minutes so no one really got a chance to read any of the material.

===The Inquest===
The Inquest in Gibraltar which followed the shooting to establish the causes of death commenced on 6 September 1988 and lasted until 30 September 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The proceedings attracted much interest from the international press who followed the proceedings as well as from the [[Government of Ireland]], the [[International League of Human Rights]], the [[National Council for Civil Liberties]] and the [[International Association of Democratic Lawyers]].&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fianna Fáil]], the largest political party in Ireland at the time, also sent an observer, [[David Andrews]], a man who would subsequently serve as the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Irish Foreign Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews claimed that the British security police would be on trial.&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers acting at the Inquest on behalf of the families of the deceased applied to have the hearing held without a jury, fearing that a local jury might not be totally objective. However, their application was refused.&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Inquest, certificates were issued that certain information should not, in the public interest, be disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt; This included the identity of the soldiers involved in the operation (referred to only as soldiers A to G) as well as sensitive operational information.&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt; 79 witnesses gave evidence. The identity of the soldiers was protected by a tent erected in the patio of the Supreme Court with a thick curtain behind which witnesses gave evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The SAS came under intense scrutiny at the Inquest and the question which arose was whether there had been a security blunder on their part when they shot dead the terrorists having assumed that they were armed and about to detonate a bomb.&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers for the families argued that the decision to kill the suspects had been made by the Government of the United Kingdom before the incident and the soldiers were ordered to carry out the shootings. Alternatively, they argued, the operation had been planned and implemented in such a way that the killing of the suspects by the soldiers was the inevitable result.&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing by a 9-2 majority.&lt;ref&gt;Restano, John &quot;Justice so Requiring: The Emergence and Development of a Legal System in Gibraltar&quot;; Calpe Press 2012 pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;        

===European Court of Human Rights===
The Inquest was not the end of the matter. The matter came before the the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;McCann and others v. United Kingdom (1996) 21 EHLRR 97&lt;/ref&gt;. The Court ruled by the narrowest of margins (10 to 9) that the killing did not constitute use of force which was &quot;absolutely necessary&quot; and that article 2 (right to life) of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] had been violated.&lt;ref&gt;McCann and others v. United Kingdom (1996) 21 EHLRR 97&lt;/ref&gt;
