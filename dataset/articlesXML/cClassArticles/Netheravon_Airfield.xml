'''Netheravon Airfield''' is a grass strip airfield on [[Salisbury Plain]], in [[Wiltshire]], [[England]]. Established in 1913 by the [[Royal Flying Corps]], it became '''RAF Netheravon''' from 1918 until 1963, then '''AAC Netheravon''' ([[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]]) until 2012. Buildings from 1913 and 1914 survive on part of the site.

== Location ==
The airfield lies on Salisbury Plain, mostly in [[Fittleton]] parish, extending south into [[Figheldean]]. It is close to [[Netheravon]] village and about {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} north of the town of [[Amesbury]].

Its buildings are on two sites. Technical buildings, including as the control tower and hangars, are immediately southwest of the runways. About {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} further southwest, towards Netheravon, is Airfield Camp (also known as Lower Camp) which has offices, a training school (the Airmen's Institute), an Officers' Mess and barracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;listing&quot;&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1284240|desc=Officers' Mess and Quarters, Airfield Camp|access-date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Defence land which surrounds the site is part of the [[Salisbury Plain Training Area]].

== Royal Flying Corps, 1912–1918 ==
Much farmland in the area was bought by the [[War Office]] around 1898 for military training.&lt;ref name=&quot;vchfitt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|website=British History Online|title=Victoria County History: Wiltshire: Vol 11 pp142-151 - Fittleton|editor-first=D.A.|editor-last=Crowley|author-first1=A.P.|author-last1=Baggs|author-first2=Elizabeth|author-last2=Crittall|author-first3=Jane|author-last3=Freeman|author-first4=Janet H|author-last4=Stevenson|url=|publisher=University of London|date=1980|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with nearby [[RAF Upavon|Upavon]] and [[Larkhill]], the airfield was part of the formative phase of military flying.  The [[Royal Flying Corps]] was established in April 1912; in May its [[Central Flying School]] was formed at Upavon, and its Military Wing was formed from the [[Air Battalion]], which flew aircraft at Larkhill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The RFC: Formation|website=Royal Air Force Museum|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/rfc_centenary/the-rfc/formation.aspx|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netheravon site near Choulston Farm was selected towards the end of 1912, and at first was called Choulston Camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacj&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Airfield Camp, Netheravon 1912-2012|journal=Army Air Corps Journal|date=2012|issue=52|pages=40–42|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/aac-Airfield_Camp_Netheravon.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airfield used a road which extended from Netheravon across farmland, to serve two 19th-century groups of farm buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehstudy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cocroft|first1=Wayne|last2=Holborow|first2=Will|last3=Lake|first3=Jeremy|last4=Thomas|first4=Roger|title=Ministry of Defence disposals: Wiltshire (115-2011)|url=http://services.english-heritage.org.uk/ResearchReportsPdfs/115_2011WEB.PDF|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=19 September 2016|pages=91–99|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the site was ready, service personnel were housed in tents or at the former cavalry school at Netheravon House, south of Netheravon village.&lt;ref name=&quot;vchfitt&quot; /&gt; Standardised designs and prefabricated methods helped construction to proceed quickly, and [[No. 3 Squadron RFC|No. 3 Squadron]] moved here in June 1913, followed soon after by [[No. 4 Squadron RFC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aacj&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Royal Flying Corps Prior To First World War Q69243.jpg|thumb|RFC aircraft and tents at Netheravon, June 1914]]
In June 1914, under the leadership of Lt Col (later Air Vice Marshal) [[Frederick Sykes|F H Sykes]], the airfield was the site of a gathering of RFC men and machines. Known as the Netheravon Concentration Camp, the exercise was designed to test mobilisation and improve the RFC's public reputation, as well as providing training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lieutenant-Colonel Eric Ash|title=Sir Frederick Sykes and the Air Revolution 1912-1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_QrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-31516-9|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flight'' magazine reported &quot;upwards of 700 officers and men&quot; and published photographs showing lines of tents for the visiting squadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Flying Corps (Military Wing) at Netheravon.

In August, following the declaration of war, 3 and 4 squadrons left for France to support the [[Royal Flying Corps#1914–15: Initial actions with the British Expeditionary Force|British Expeditionary Force]]. They were replaced by [[No. 1 Squadron RFC|No. 1 Squadron]] which had a training role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Philpott|title=The Birth of the Royal Air Force|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcY7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA256|date=9 December 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-4738-3312-8|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netheravon became a forming-up point for new squadrons; an example is [[No. 11 Squadron RFC|No. 11 Squadron]], formed here in February 1915 and deployed to France in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 Squadron|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/11squadron.cfm|website=Royal Air Force|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the home of No. 8 Training Depot Station{{sfn|Sturtivant|Hamlin|2007|p=276-280}} which trained aircrew, groundcrew, specialist signallers and fitters.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacj&quot; /&gt;

==Royal Air Force, 1918–1963==
After the war, now a station of the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]], Netheravon was used for disbandment of squadrons. A range of hangars was built in 1918 to house [[Handley Page O/400]] bombers, but plans to develop Netheravon as a bomber base were soon shelved.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacj&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;listinghp&quot; /&gt; From 1919 until 1931 it was the home of [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAF|No. 1 Flying Training School]]; between 1924 and 1928, trainees included crews for the newly created [[Fleet Air Arm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aacj&quot; /&gt; Training resumed in 1935 under [[No. 6 Flying Training School RAF]], which left for Little Rissington in 1938 and was replaced by a new incarnation of No.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;FTS, renamed to No. 1 Service Flying Training School in 1939.{{sfn|Sturtivant|Hamlin|2007|p=134}}

In the 1939-45 war, Netheravon saw short stays by various squadrons, while training activities continued. In 1941 training of Fleet Air Arm aircrew [[British Flying Training School Program|relocated]] to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacj&quot; /&gt; Squadrons based at Netheravon included [[No. 297 Squadron RAF|297]] (from December 1941),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raf38group.org/297squadron|title=297 Squadron, 38 Group : History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.raf38group.org|publisher=|access-date=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 296 Squadron RAF|296]] (January 1942)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raf38group.org/296squadron|title=296 Squadron, 38 Group : History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.raf38group.org|publisher=|access-date=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[No. 295 Squadron RAF|295]] (August 1942).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raf38group.org/295squadron|title=295 Squadron, 38 Group : History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.raf38group.org|publisher=|access-date=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 the airfield was used to prepare gliders for their role in the [[invasion of Normandy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ehstudy&quot; /&gt;

After the war, the site was used for various purposes, including [[RAF Police]] training. Additional married quarters were built at Airfield Camp in the 1950s, and c.&amp;nbsp;1952 a Roman Catholic church was opened there.&lt;ref name=&quot;vchfig&quot;&gt;{{cite web|website=British History Online|title=Victoria County History: Wiltshire: Vol 15 pp105-119 - Figheldean|editor-first=D.A.|editor-last=Crowley|author-first1=A.P.|author-last1=Baggs|author-first2=Jane|author-last2=Freeman|author-first3=Janet H|author-last3=Stevenson|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/wilts/vol15/pp105-119|publisher=University of London|date=1995|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Army Air Corps, 1964–2012==
[[File:DH.89A Dragon Rapide G-AJHO Roth.Army Neth 20.04.68 edited-2.jpg|thumb|DH.89A Dragon Rapide G-AJHO of the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon, 1968]]
The site was transferred to the [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] in 1963 and became AAC Netheravon. [[No. 651 Squadron RAF|No. 651 Squadron]] moved here in 1964 and had responsibility for Army aviation in the UK (other than at [[AAC Middle Wallop|Middle Wallop]]) and the Middle East. By the 1970s 7 (Training) Regiment was here; the regiment transferred to the volunteer reserve, the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], in 1995. 7 Regiment moved to Middle Wallop in 2009 and the Army left the site in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacj&quot; /&gt;

==Today==
[[File:Air traffic control, Netheravon Airfield - geograph.org.uk - 457236.jpg|thumb|Control tower in 2007]]
The airfield is used by the '''Joint Services Parachute Centre''', part of the Army's &quot;Adventurous Training&quot; programme for serving and injured personnel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adventurous Training Activities|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/events/adventurous/23212.aspx|website=army.mod.uk|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is home to the Army Parachute Association, a charity which supports sports parachuting for serving and retired personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Army Parachute Association|url=http://www.netheravon.com/|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Listed buildings ==
[[File:Southwestern corner of Netheravon Camp (geograph 3452798).jpg|thumb|Part of the officers' quarters at Airfield Camp]]
The Officers' Mess and quarters at Airfield Camp, completed in 1914, are [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II* listed]]. The Mess is partly two-storey, while the linked accommodation block and the nine detached four-room chalets are single-storey. Construction is softwood framing with asbestos-cement panels, their joints covered with painted wood strips, under a tiled roof. Historic England describe the group of buildings as &quot;of outstanding historical interest, and of striking architectural form, comprising some of the earliest extant buildings erected for the RFC&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;listing&quot; /&gt;

Six further buildings from the same phase,&lt;ref&gt;Search for SU1548 at [https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/map-search Historic Englad: Map search]&lt;/ref&gt; and a range of five linked hangars from 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;listinghp&quot;&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1391480|desc=Building No 38A (Handley Page Hangars)|access-date=23 September 2016|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; are Grade II listed. At the site near the airfield, the 1914 Main Depot Offices, in the same style as the Camp buildings, are also Grade II.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1391822|desc=Building 52c (Main Depot Offices)|access-date=23 September 2016|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
