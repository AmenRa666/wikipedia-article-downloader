'''John William Finn''' (23 July 1909 – 27 May 2010) was a sailor in the [[United States Navy]] who, as a [[chief petty officer]], received the United States military's highest decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his actions during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in [[World War II]]. As a [[Chief Petty Officer|chief]] [[aviation ordnanceman]] stationed at [[Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay]], he earned the medal by manning a machine gun from an exposed position throughout the attack, despite being repeatedly wounded. He continued to serve in the Navy and in 1942 was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]. In 1947 he was reverted to chief petty officer, eventually rising to [[lieutenant]] before his 1956 retirement. In his later years he made many appearances at events celebrating veterans. At the time of his death, Finn was the oldest [[List of living Medal of Honor recipients|living Medal of Honor recipient]] and the last living recipient from the attack on Pearl Harbor.

==Early life==
Born on 24 July 1909, in [[Compton, California]], Finn dropped out of school after the seventh grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Collier|first=Peter|title=Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty|publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company]]|location=New York|year=2006|page=83|isbn=978-1-57965-314-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enlisted in the Navy in July 1926, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, and completed [[recruit training]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leahy&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leahy|first=J. F.|title=Ask the Chief: Backbone of the Navy|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis|year=2004|pages=191|isbn=978-1-59114-460-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljcFDOC6q3UC |accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief stint with a ceremonial guard company, he attended General Aviation Utilities Training at [[Naval Station Great Lakes]], graduating in December. By April 1927 he was back in the San Diego area, having been assigned to [[Naval Air Station North Island]]. He initially worked in aircraft repair before becoming an [[aviation ordnanceman]] and working on [[anti-aircraft]] guns. He then served on a series of ships: the {{USS|Lexington|CV-2}}, the {{USS|Houston|CA-30}}, the {{USS|Jason|AC-12}}, the {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3}}, and the {{USS|Cincinnati|CL-6}}.

Finn was promoted to [[Chief petty officer (United States)|chief petty officer]] (E-7, the highest enlisted rank in the Navy at that time&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/organization-and-administration/ranks/enlisted-personnel/history-of-the-chief-petty-officer.html&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1935 after only nine years of active duty. He later commented on his promotions, &quot;Everybody thought I was a boy wonder. I was just in the right place at the right time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quarterdeck.org/book/finn.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As a chief, Finn served with [[patrol squadron]]s in San Diego, [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and [[Panama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leahy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PerryLAT&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=WWII veteran, the oldest surviving Medal of Honor recipient, dies at 100|last=Perry|first=Tony|date=29 May 2010|work=The Virginian Pilot via the Los Angeles Times|page=6|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack on Pearl Harbor==

Finn (right) received for his defense of [[Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay]] during the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941.|alt=A woman stands next to a man dressed in chief petty officer dress whites admiring a medal of honor the man is wearing]]
By December 1941, Finn was stationed at [[Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay]] on the island of [[Oahu]] in [[Hawaii]]. As a chief aviation ordnanceman, he was in charge of twenty men whose primary task was to maintain the weapons of VP-11, a [[PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]] squadron. At 7:48&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the morning of Sunday, 7 December 1941, Finn was at his home, about a mile from the aircraft hangars, when he heard the sound of gunfire. Finn recalled how a neighbor was the first to alert him, when she knocked on his door saying, &quot;They want you down at the squadron right away!&quot; He drove to the hangars, catching sight of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] planes in the sky on the way, and found that the airbase was being attacked, with most of the PBYs already on fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PerryLAT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn20090915&quot;/&gt;

Finn's men were trying to fight back by using the machine guns mounted in the PBYs, either by firing from inside the flaming planes or by detaching the guns and mounting them on improvised stands. Finn later explained that one of the first things he did was to take control of a machine gun from his squadron's painter. &quot;I said, 'Alex, let me take that gun'&amp;nbsp;... knew that I had more experience firing a machine gun than a painter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PerryLAT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn20090915&quot;/&gt;

Finding a movable tripod platform used for gunnery training, Finn attached the [[.50 caliber machine gun]] and pushed the platform into an open area, from which he had a clear view of the attacking aircraft. He fired on the Japanese planes for the next two hours, even after being seriously wounded, until the attack had ended. In total, he received 21 distinct wounds, including a bullet through his right foot and an injury to his left shoulder, which caused him to lose feeling in his left arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;

&quot;I got that gun and I started shooting at Jap planes,&quot; Finn said in a 2009 interview. &quot;I was out there shooting the Jap planes and just every so often I was a target for some,&quot; he said, &quot;In some cases, I could see their [the Japanese pilots'] faces.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn20090915&quot;/&gt;

Despite his wounds, Finn returned to the hangars later that day. After receiving medical treatment, he helped arm the surviving American planes.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PerryLAT&quot;/&gt; His actions earned him the first Medal of Honor to be awarded in World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;WaPo29MAY2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBSav2003&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmohs.org/medal-history.php |title=History |author=Doug Sterner |year=2013 |publisher=Congressional Medal of Honor Society |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |title=John Finn dies&amp;nbsp;— earned WWII Medal of Honor |author=Julie Watson |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/John-Finn-dies-earned-WWII-Medal-of-Honor-3263478.php |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was formally presented with the decoration on 14 September 1942, by Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], for courage and valor beyond the call of duty. The ceremony took place in Pearl Harbor on board the {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PerryLAT&quot;/&gt;

In 1942 Finn was commissioned, and served as a [[Limited Duty Officer]] with the rank of ensign. In 1947 he was reverted to his enlisted rank of chief petty officer, eventually becoming a lieutenant with Bombing Squadron [[VB-102]] and aboard the {{USS|Hancock|CV-19}}. He retired from the Navy as a lieutenant in September 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;PerryLAT&quot;/&gt;

==Later life and legacy==

From 1956 until shortly before his death, Finn resided on a {{convert|90|acre|km2|adj=on}} ranch in Live Oak Springs, near [[Pine Valley, California]]. He and his wife became foster parents to five [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] children, causing him to be embraced by the  Campo Band of Diegueño Mission Indians, a tribe of [[Kumeyaay]] people in San Diego.  His wife, Alice Finn, died in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;WaPo29MAY2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |author=Shapiro, T. Rees |title=Lt. John W.

In his retirement he made many appearances at events honoring veterans.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdut20100527&quot;/&gt;  On 25 March 2009, he attended National Medal of Honor Day ceremonies at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. With the aid of walking sticks, he stood beside U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] during a wreath-laying ceremony at the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]]. Later that day, Finn was a guest at the [[White House]]. It was his first visit to the White House, and his first time meeting a sitting President.&lt;ref name=&quot;PerryLAT&quot;/&gt;

On June 27, 2009, a crowd of over 2,000 made up of family, friends and well-wishers came to Pine Valley to celebrate Finn's 100th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/history/item/4799-john-finn-last-of-pearls-medal-of-honor-heroes&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of Aviation Ordnancemen presented him with an American flag which had flown on each of the 11 aircraft carriers then in active service.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdut20090725&quot;/&gt;

When called a hero during a 2009 interview Finn responded:

{{quote|That damned hero stuff is a bunch [of] crap, I guess.&amp;nbsp;[...] You gotta understand that there's all kinds of heroes, but they never get a chance to be in a hero's position.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn20090915&quot;/&gt;}}

[[File:Finn funeral.jpg|thumb|Hearse carrying the remains of Finn.]]
Finn died at age 100 on the morning of 27 May 2010, at the [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] Veterans Home.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdut20100527&quot;/&gt; He was buried besides his wife at the [[Campo Indian Reservation]]'s cemetery, after a memorial service in [[El Cajon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Family and friends bid farewell to John Finn |author=Onell R.

{{quotation|For extraordinary heroism, distinguished service, and devotion above and beyond the call of duty.  During the first attack by Japanese airplanes on the Naval Air Station, Kaneohe Bay, Territory of Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, he promptly secured and manned a .50 caliber machine gun mounted on an instruction stand in a completely exposed section of  the parking  ramp, which was under heavy enemy machine gun strafing fire.  Although painfully wounded many times, he continued to man this gun and to return the enemy's fire vigorously and with telling effect throughout the enemy strafing and bombing attacks and with complete disregard for his own personal safety. It was only by specific orders that he was persuaded to leave his post to seek medical attention. Following first-aid treatment, although obviously suffering much pain and moving with great difficulty, he returned to the squadron area and actively supervised the rearming of returning planes. His extraordinary  heroism and conduct in this action are considered to be in keeping with the highest traditions of the Naval Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/pers-us/uspers-f/j-finn.htm |title=Lieutenant John William Finn, USN, (1909–2010) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=Naval History &amp; Heritage Command |publisher=United States Navy |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
