'''Charles Louis Critchfield''' (June 7, 1910 – February 12, 1994) was an [[Americans|American]] [[mathematical physicist]]. A graduate of [[George Washington University]], where he earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Physics under the direction of [[Edward Teller]] in 1939, he conducted research in [[ballistics]]  at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and received three patents for improved [[sabot]] designs.

In 1943, Teller and  [[Robert Oppenheimer]] persuaded Critchfield to come to the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], where he joined the Ordnance Division under [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William Sterling Parsons|William Parsons]] on the [[gun-type fission weapon]]s, [[Little Boy]] and [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]. After it was discovered that the Thin Man design would not work, he was transferred to [[Robert Bacher]]'s Gadget Division as the leader of the  Initiator group, which was  responsible for the design and testing of the [[Modulated neutron initiator#Urchin|&quot;Urchin&quot; neutron initiator]] that provided the burst of neutrons that kick-started the nuclear detonation of the [[Fat Man]] weapon.

After the war he became a professor at the [[University of Minnesota]], and then  vice president for research at the [[Convair]] division of [[General Dynamics]], where he worked on the [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas family of rockets]]. In 1961, [[J. Carson Mark]] and [[Norris Bradbury]] offered him a position at Los Alamos, which he held until he retired in 1977.

== Early life ==
Charles Louis Critchfield was born in [[Shreve, Ohio]], on June 7, 1910, and grew up in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name='OBIT' /&gt;&lt;ref name='BIRTHPLACE'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.petervogel.us/lastwave/chapters/LastWave_Ch11.pdf | title = Manhattan Project U235 production data, 1943–1945 (See p6) | accessdate = April 18, 2012 | last = Vogel | first = Peter | work = The Last Wave from Port Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] (1934) and [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1936) degrees in Mathematics from [[George Washington University]], where he also earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Physics (1939) under the direction of [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref name='PTOBIT' /&gt;

During Critchfield's graduate studies, Teller's colleague [[George Gamow]]&lt;ref name='GAMOW' /&gt; introduced him to [[Hans Bethe]], with whom he wrote a paper in 1938, which analyzed the [[Nuclear fusion#Astrophysical reaction chains|nuclear fusion]] of [[protons]] into [[deuterons]].&lt;ref name='PTOD' /&gt;  The next year, Bethe showed that this process is a key link in the [[proton-proton chain reaction]] and the [[CNO cycle]], which are the major ways that nuclear energy is released in the [[solar core]] and in massive stars.&lt;ref name='BETHE' /&gt;  In 1967,  Bethe was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for this work on [[stellar nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name='SCHWEBER' /&gt;

== World War II ==
After he graduated, Critchfield taught optics for a year at the [[University of Rochester]] at the invitation of [[Victor Weisskopf]].&lt;ref name='PTOBIT' /&gt; In 1940, he was awarded a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] fellowship, and went to work under [[Eugene Wigner]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton University|Princeton]].&lt;ref name='IAS' /&gt;  At this time, Robert Kent had just recruited [[John von Neumann]] to the advisory board of the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]. Critchfield joined von Neumann and Wigner there on several visits.&lt;ref name='KENT' /&gt;&lt;ref name='ORAL' /&gt;

[[File:Jette Critchfield and Oppenheimer.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Eric Jette]], Charles Critchfield, and [[Robert Oppenheimer]] at Los Alamos]]
In 1942, after a brief stay at [[Harvard University]], Critchfield went to the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution of Washington]], where he continued his ballistic studies, which resulted in three patents for improved [[sabot]] designs.&lt;ref name='PATENTS' /&gt; Because of his experience with [[ballistics]], Teller and  [[Robert Oppenheimer]] persuaded Critchfield to come to the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in 1943,&lt;ref name='LANLBIO' /&gt; where he joined the Ordnance Division under [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William Sterling Parsons|William Parsons]].&lt;ref name='ORAL' /&gt;  As leader of the target, projectile, and source group, he worked on the [[gun-type fission weapon]]s, [[Little Boy]] and [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]].&lt;ref name='GUNS' /&gt;

In April 1944, the Manhattan Project experienced a crisis when [[Emilio Segrè]] discovered that [[plutonium]] made in [[nuclear reactors]] would not work in Thin Man.&lt;ref name='GUNS' /&gt;  In response, Oppenheimer completely reorganized the laboratory to focus on development of an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] in August.  He reassigned Critchfield to a new Gadget Division under [[Robert Bacher]], as the leader of the  Initiator group.&lt;ref name='PROJECT' /&gt; This group was responsible for the design and testing of the [[Modulated neutron initiator#Urchin|&quot;Urchin&quot; neutron initiator]], which provided a burst of neutrons that kick-started the nuclear detonation of the [[Fat Man]] weapon.&lt;ref name='MEADE' /&gt;

== Postwar ==
Critchfield left Los Alamos in 1946 and returned to George Washington University, but soon left to join Wigner at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name='PTOBIT' /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MPVA&quot; /&gt; In 1947 he became an assistant professor at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he participated, with [[Edward P. Ney]] and [[John R. Winckler]], in a classified project to improve balloon technology.&lt;ref name='FINAL' /&gt; Here, with Leland S. Bohl, he invented and patented the natural shape balloon,&lt;ref name='NATURAL' /&gt; and participated, with Ney and his student Sophie Oleksa, in an early search for primary cosmic ray electrons.&lt;ref name='OLEKSA' /&gt;

In 1955, after advancing to full professor at Minnesota, Critchfield became vice president for research at the [[Convair]] division of [[General Dynamics]].&lt;ref name='ROBERT' /&gt;  Here, he worked on the [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas family of rockets]], which began as a series of [[SM-65 Atlas|ICBMs]] and evolved into launch vehicles for [[Project Mercury]] and [[Atlas-Centaur|many other space missions]].  He also created the Convair Scientific Research Laboratory whose staff were expected to serve as consultants for the company's engineering divisions and to carry out basic scientific research.  In 1957, Critchfield's student William C. Erickson joined the staff, and created the Clark Lake Radio Observatory.&lt;ref name='CLARKLAKE' /&gt;  In 1963, this facility, where observations focused on long wavelength radio waves, was transferred to the [[University of Maryland]], where Erickson had become a professor.  Although the original observatory has been abandoned, similar research continues at the much larger [[Long Wavelength Array]] in central [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name='ARRAY' /&gt;

== Later life ==
In early November 1959, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Neil H. McElroy]] selected Critchfield to be head of the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]]. McElroy hoped that Critchfield would be able to fix the nation's trouble missile program, but Critchfield was reluctant to serve at the director's $19,000 salary. McElroy then offered to let Critchfield serve without pay, with the government paying only his expenses of $15 per day, while allowing Critchfield to continue to draw his Convair salary of around $40,000. Critchfield accepted this offer, but ran into a storm of political and media criticism over the conflict of interest involved in heading an agency that did $4 million worth of business with Convair each year. Critchfield then withdrew his name from consideration.&lt;ref name='TIME1' /&gt;&lt;ref name='TIME2' /&gt;

In 1961, Critchfield accepted a professorship at the [[University of Wisconsin]], but before he moved to Madison, his friends at Los Alamos, [[J. Carson Mark]] and [[Norris Bradbury]] offered him a position there that he took instead.&lt;ref name='ROBERT' /&gt;  He held this position until he retired in 1977, but he continued his association with the laboratory until his death after a long battle with cancer on February 12, 1994.  His obituary in [[Physics Today]] was written by  Carson Mark, [[Louis Rosen]], Edward Teller, and Roger Meade.&lt;ref name='PTOBIT' /&gt;

Charles Critchfield is buried next to his wife, Jean, in Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos County, New Mexico.&lt;ref name='GUAJE' /&gt;
