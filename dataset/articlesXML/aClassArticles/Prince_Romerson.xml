'''Prince Romerson''' ({{circa|1840}} – March 30, 1872) was an American [[Union Army]] soldier of [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]] descent. One of the &quot;Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War&quot;, he was among a group of more than one hundred documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants who fought in the [[American Civil War]] while the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was still an independent nation.

Living in the American Northeast before the war, Romerson enlisted in the [[Union Navy]] in 1863 as part of the [[Atlantic Blockading Squadron|Blockading Squadrons]] responsible for maintaining the [[Union blockade|blockade]] of the ports of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. After being discharged from naval service, he continued fighting and reenlisted in the [[Union Army]] under the [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry]], a [[United States Colored Troops|United States Colored regiment]], and was promoted to the rank of [[sergeant]] on June{{nbsp}}1, 1864. Romerson fought with the 5th{{nbsp}}USCC until the end of the war. Illness prevented him from continuing with his regiment's reassignment to [[Clarksville, Texas]], and he was mustered out in 1865. After the war, like many former USCT veterans, he fought in the frontier army as part of the [[Buffalo Soldier]]s. He died in 1872.{{sfn|McCunn|2015|pages=142–145}} In 2010, the Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] in [[Honolulu]].{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015|pages=161–163}}

==Life==
After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], King [[Kamehameha IV]] declared the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]'s neutrality on August{{nbsp}}26, 1861.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1953|pages=57–66}} Many [[Native Hawaiian]]s and Hawaii-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Native Hawaiian participation in American wars was not unheard of; Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the [[War of 1812]], and even more served during the American Civil War.{{sfn|Schmitt|1998|pages=171–172}} Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaii's ties to [[New England]] through missionaries and the whaling industry, and the ideological opposition of many to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].{{sfn|Manning|Vance|2014|pages=145–170}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Vance&amp;Manning&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2013&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Jeffrey Allen|title=The Civil War and Hawaii|newspaper=The New York Times: Opinionator|location=New York|date=August 13, 2013|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/the-civil-war-and-hawaii/?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Romerson was born around 1840, but little is known about his life before the war. There is no indication that his first name denotes any royal status, and his surname was often listed as &quot;Robinson&quot;. Different versions of his enlistment records noted his birthplace as &quot;Owyhee, Sandwich Island&quot; (the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]]{{#tag:ref|Also interpreted as [[Oahu]]&lt;ref name=&quot;HI2015&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;API2015&quot;/&gt; or &quot;Nyhee&quot;.{{sfn|Bautista|2002|page=241}}{{sfn|Mercene|2007|page=47}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Burlingame2008&quot;/&gt;|group=note}}), or &quot;[[India]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HI2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foenander|first1=Terry|last2=Milligan|first2=Edward|display-authors=etal|title=Hawaiians in the Civil War|date=March 2015|url=http://www.nps.gov/civilwar/upload/More-Info-on-Hawaiians-in-the-Civil-War-Alphabetically-by-Name.pdf|work=National Park Service|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;API2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foenander|first1=Terry|last2=Milligan|first2=Edward|display-authors=etal|title=Asians and Pacific Islanders in the Civil War|date=March 2015|url=https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/upload/More-Info-on-Asians-Pacific-Islanders-in-the-Civil-War-Alphabetically-by-Name.pdf|work=National Park Service|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also disagreement over his ethnicity. Some Filipino historians have claimed him as one of their own, and he is included in lists of Filipino American Civil War combatants.{{sfn|Bautista|2002|page=241}}{{sfn|Mercene|2007|page=47}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Burlingame2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Burlingame|first=Burl|title=Civil War database lists soldiers and sailors from isles|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=August 26, 2008|volume=13|issue=239|location=Honolulu|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2008/08/26/features/story02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romerson worked as a barber prior to his enlistment in 1863. It is thought that he came to the United States as a sailor aboard a merchant or whaling ship in the Pacific; Hawaiian sailors were highly regarded in the 18th- and 19th-century maritime industry and sought out as crew members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vance&amp;Manning&quot;/&gt; Regardless, it is known that Romerson was living in New York prior to joining the Navy. Probably helped by his experience at sea, he enlisted on January{{nbsp}}22, 1863, as a [[Landsman (rank)|landsman]] in the [[Union Navy]]. He served on the [[USS Wamsutta (1853)|USS ''Wamsutta'']] and [[USS Mercedita (1861)|USS ''Mercidita'']] as part of the [[Atlantic Blockading Squadron|Blockading Squadrons]], responsible for maintaining the [[Union blockade|blockade]] of the ports of the Confederate States.{{sfn|McCunn|2015|pages=142–145}}

After serving in the Navy for a year, Romerson joined as a private in Company{{nbsp}}M of the [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry]].{{sfn|Massachusetts|1933|page=542}}&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Soldier Details|url=http://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-soldiers-detail.htm?soldierId=FAB6E7CA-DC7A-DF11-BF36-B8AC6F5D926A|work=National Park Service|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war, he was probably assigned to the [[United States Colored Troops|colored regiments]] because of his dark skin color and the military's segregationist policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vance&amp;Manning&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Raphael-Hernandez|Steen|2006|page=321}} Romerson is one of the few Hawaiian soldiers of the Civil War whose real name is known; many combatants served under anglicized pseudonyms (''nome de guerre'') because they were easier for English-speaking Americans to pronounce than [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] names. They were often registered as ''[[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|kanaka]]s'', the 19th-century term for Hawaiians and [[Pacific Islander]]s, with the &quot;[[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]]&quot; (i.e. Hawaii) noted as their place of origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vance&amp;Manning&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vance|first1=Justin W.|last2=Manning|first2=Anita|title=The Effects of the American Civil War on Hawai’i and the Pacific World|journal=World History Connected|volume=9|issue=3|year=October 2012|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=University of Illinois|url=http://worldhistoryconnected.press.illinois.edu/9.3/vance.html|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PrinceRomersonEnlistment5thMA.jpg|right|thumb|Enlistment card for Prince Romerson]]
Romerson was quickly promoted to [[sergeant]] on June 1, 1864, possibly because he was literate.{{sfn|McCunn|2015|pages=142–145}} Serving in the same regiment was another Hawaiian soldier named Charles Heatley.{{sfn|Okihiro|2015|pages=88–89}} Romerson fought with his regiment at the [[Second Battle of Petersburg]] and took part in the Richmond–Petersburg Campaign, better-known as the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. He also served as a guard for the Confederate prison camp at [[Point Lookout State Park|Camp Lookout, Maryland]]. Between the Union victory at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]] and the 5th Regiment's reassignment to [[Clarksville, Texas]], Romerson fell ill and was sent to the Corps d'Afrique USA General Hospital in [[New Orleans]] on July{{nbsp}}8, 1865. Never recovering sufficiently to rejoin his regiment, he was transferred to De{{nbsp}}Camp USA General Hospital, [[Davids' Island (New York)|David's Island]], New York, before being mustered out on October{{nbsp}}9, 1865.{{sfn|McCunn|2015|pages=142–145}}{{sfn|Massachusetts|1933|page=492}}{{sfn|Dyer|1908|page=1240}}

In the post-war period, Romerson sought to rejoin the military, and in 1867 he enlisted in the 39th United States Infantry Regiment at the reduced rank of private. The 39th later consolidated with the 40th to create the [[25th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th United States Infantry Regiment]]. A racially segregated unit of the United States Army, its personnel were dubbed &quot;[[Buffalo Soldier]]s&quot; and included many Civil War veterans from colored regiments such as the 5th{{nbsp}}USCC. Romerson served in the 25th for a full three-year term fighting in the [[American Indian Wars]] along the Texas frontier. He died on March{{nbsp}}30, 1872, possibly at [[Fort Griffin]], where he was initially buried. On May{{nbsp}}11, 1872, he was re-interred at the [[San Antonio National Cemetery]].{{sfn|McCunn|2015|pages=142–145}}

==Legacy==
After the war, the military service of Hawaiians, including Prince Romerson and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective memories of the American Civil War and the history of Hawaii. In recent years, Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember &quot;our boys from Hawaii&quot;. Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history has inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015|pages=161–163}} On August{{nbsp}}26, 2010, on the anniversary of the signing of the Hawaiian Neutrality Proclamation, a bronze plaque was erected along the memorial pathway at the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] in Honolulu recognizing these Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War, the more than one hundred documented Hawaiians who served during the American Civil War for both the Union and the Confederacy.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015|pages=161–163}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Cole2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cole|first=William|title=Native Hawaiians served on both sides during Civil War|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2010/May/31/ln/hawaii5310346.html|date=May 31, 2010|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|location=Honolulu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plaque&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorial Plaque|website=Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War|url=http://hawaiisonsofthecivilwar.com/memorial-plaque/|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2014, researchers have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records. The exact number still remains unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under anglicized pseudonyms, and little is known about them due to the lack of detailed records.{{sfn|Grzyb|2016|pages=127–128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Chelsea|title=Hawaiian Civil War soldier finally recognized|newspaper=Hawaii News Show|date=October 26, 2014|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/27016661/hawaiian-civil-war-solider-finally-recognized}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Punaboy|title=Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War|website=Aloha Valley|date=June 20, 2015|url=http://alohavalley.com/hawaii-sons-of-the-civil-war/|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the sesquicentennial of the end of the American Civil War, the [[National Park Service]] released a publication entitled ''Asians and Pacific Islanders and the Civil War'', concerning the service of the large number of combatants of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who fought during the war. The history of Hawaii's involvement and the biographies of Romerson and others were written by historians [[Ruthanne Lum McCunn]], Anita Manning and Justin Vance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hawaiʻi Pacific University|title=HPU partners with National Park Service, Hawaii Civil War Round Table for July 17 talk|newspaper=HPU News|date=July 15, 2015|url=http://www.hpu.edu/HPUNews/2015/07/civil-war.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| Shively|2015|pages=130–163}}
