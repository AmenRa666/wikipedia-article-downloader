'''''Gerald R. Ford'' (CVN-78)''' is the [[lead ship]] of [[Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier|her class]] of [[United States Navy]] [[supercarrier]]s. It is currently a [[pre-commissioning unit]] (PCU) expected to be commissioned into the Navy in 2016.  The ship is named after the 38th [[President of the United States]] [[Gerald R. Ford]], whose [[World War II]] naval service included combat duty aboard the [[light aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Monterey|CVL-26|2}} in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=10399 Navy Names New Aircraft Carrier USS Gerald R.

On 3 January 2007, former [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] announced that the aircraft carrier would be named after Ford during a [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|eulogy for President Ford]] at Grace Episcopal Church in [[East Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ford.utexas.edu/grf/Funeral/rumsfeld.asp Gerald R.

===Construction===
On 10 September 2008, the U.S. Navy signed a $5.1&amp;nbsp;billion contract with [[Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]], to design and construct the carrier. Northrop had begun advance construction of the carrier under a $2.7â€¯billion contract in 2005. The carrier is being constructed at the Huntington Ingalls (formerly Northrop Grumman) [[Newport News Shipbuilding]] facilities in [[Newport News, Virginia]], which employs 19,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Kathy, &quot;Newport News Shipyard Gets $â€¯5.1â€¯B Contract For Carrier Ford&quot;, ''[[Norfolk Virginian-Pilot]]'', 11 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The keel of the new warship was ceremonially laid on 14 November 2009 in Dry Dock 12&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|37.0014|-76.4462 |format=dms |region:US-VA_scale:2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Ford's daughter, Susan Ford Bales. In a speech to the assembled shipworkers and DoD officials, Bales said: &quot;Dad met the staggering challenges of restoring trust in the presidency and healing the nation's wounds after Watergate in the only way he knew how â€” with complete honesty and integrity. And that is the legacy we remember this morning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Peter, &quot;Shipyard Lays Keel Of Carrier In Solemn Tribute To Gerald R. Ford&quot;, ''[[Newport News Daily Press]]'', 15 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2011, the carrier was reported to be &quot;structurally halfway complete&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;signonsandiego.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/aug/18/navys-next-aircraft-carrier-halfway-complete/ |title= Navy's next aircraft carrier halfway complete |publisher=Signon San Diego |date=18 August 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, it was said to be 75 percent complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/military/dp-nws-carrier-ford-75percent-20120416,0,6450194.story |title=Topic Galleries |publisher= Daily press | accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 2012, the important milestone of completing the vessel up to the [[waterline]] was reached when the critical lower bow was lifted into place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bow piece for USS Gerald R.

On 8 October 2012, the carrier reached over 88 percent of the complete structural construction.

On 11 July 2013, a time capsule was welded into a small room just above the floor, continuing a long Navy tradition.

As of 2013, construction costs were estimated at $12.8 billion, 22% over the 2008 budget, plus $4.7 billion in research and development costs.  Because of budget difficulties, the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Admiral [[Jonathan Greenert]], has warned there may be a two-year delay beyond 2016 in completing ''Gerald R. Ford''.&lt;ref name=dn-20131110&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20131110/DEFREG02/311100006/ |title=US Navy Christens Costly New Carrier, USS Ford |publisher=Gannett | work = Defense News |date = 10 November 2013 |accessdate = 22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GAO reports that the price cap will be met by the Navy accepting an incomplete ship for that cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.stripes.com/gao-navy-carrier-will-be-incomplete-cost-more-at-delivery-1.315358 |title=GAO: Navy carrier will be incomplete, cost more at delivery |last =Slavin |first =Erik |date=21 November 2014 |website= Stars and Stripes |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September 2015, the Navy announced that several weeks of testing delays will likely slip the delivery date into April or May 2016. In addition, construction was 93% complete as of September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.naval-technology.com/news/newsdelivery-of-us-navys-uss-gerald-r-ford-aircraft-carrier-further-delayed-4677028 |title=Delivery of US Navy's USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier further delayed |publisher=Kable |date=23 September 2015 |website= Naval-technology.com |accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, a memo was obtained by CNN from [[J. Michael Gilmore|Michael Gilmore]], the [[US Department of Defense]]'s Director of [[Director, Operational Test and Evaluation|Operational Testing and Evaluation]] indicating that problems with four major flight systems would further delay combat readiness of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN-delay&quot;/&gt; The ship was not expected to be delivered until November 2016 and these issues were suggested to further delay that goal. Construction of the ship is described as 98% complete, with 88% of testing finished.

===Performance improvements===
''Gerald R. Ford'' is intended to be the first of a class of aircraft carriers that offer significant performance improvements over the previous {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|4}}. ''Gerald R. Ford'' is equipped with an [[AN/SPY-3]] [[active electronically scanned array]] multi-function radar, and an island that is shorter in length and {{convert|20|ft}} taller than that of the ''Nimitz'' class; it is set {{convert|140|ft}} further aft and {{convert|3|ft}} closer to the edge of the ship. Replacing traditional [[steam catapult]]s, the [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System]] (EMALS) will launch all carrier aircraft. This innovation eliminates the traditional requirement to generate and store steam, freeing up considerable below-deck square footage. With this EMALS innovation, ''Gerald R. Ford'' can accomplish 25% more aircraft launches per day than the ''Nimitz'' class and requires 25% fewer crew members. The Navy estimates it will save $4 billion in operating costs over a 50-year lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Ford-class aircraft carrier: 25 percent more flights per day|url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/1109/USS-Gerald-R.-Ford-New-aircraft-carrier-with-25-percent-more-flights-per-day | work = CS monitor | date=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an Associated Press story:
{{Quote | â€˜She is truly a technological marvel,' [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Adm. Jonathan Greenert said in a webcast ceremony at the Newport News, Va., shipyard where ''Gerald R. Ford'' is being built.  'She will carry unmanned aircraft, [[Lockheed Martin F-35|joint strike fighter]]s, and she will deploy [[laser]]s.â€™&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Vergakis | first = Brock | title=Navy christens next generation of aircraft carrier| publisher = Yahoo | url = http://news.yahoo.com/navy-christens-next-generation-aircraft-carrier-173824577.html |date=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, these performance enhancers have proven problematic in Pentagon tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/in-testing-phase-new-carrier-plagued-by-problems-1.261377 |title=In testing phase, new carrier plagued by problems |date= 10 January 2014 |website=Stars and Stripes | accessdate= 10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January, 2014, the annual Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) report said that critical ship systems including the EMALS, Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), Dual Band Radar, and weapons elevators were not reliable enough and needed more testing and improvements.  EMALS testing recorded 201 launch failures out of 1,967 launches, equaling a reliability rate of 240 mean cycles (launching of one aircraft) between critical failures.  Testing of the AAG recorded 9 arresting failures out of 71 attempts, equaling a reliability rate of 20 mean cycles (recovery of one aircraft) between operational mission failure, a failure rate 248 times higher than should be expected.  Those systems performed at a fraction of their requirements for shipboard configurations, and even less of required standards. Radar and weapons elevator test data was not made available, but were also below expectations. The Navy maintains that further testing will resolve the problems. Tests also showed that the launching and landing systems on ''Gerald R. Ford'' would place extra stress on aircraft with external fuel tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2015/03/navy-jets-too-much-fuel-cant-launch-new-aircraft-carrier |title=Navy jets with too much fuel can't launch from new aircraft carrier |last1=Capaccio |first1=Tony |date=26 March 2015 |website=hamptonroads.com |publisher=Bloomberg News Tribune News Service |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Gerald R. Ford'' is projected to be able to generate 30 percent more sorties than ''Nimitz''-class carriers, but the DOT&amp;E report claims that is too optimistic, though the Navy also maintains that assumption based on modeling and simulations.  ''Gerald R. Ford'' is planned to complete Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation in 2017 before entering service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.dodbuzz.com/2014/01/31/navy-alerted-to-ford-class-carrier-reliability-issues/ | title = Navy Alerted to Ford-class Carrier Reliability Issues | newspaper = DoD Buzz | date = 31 January 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
