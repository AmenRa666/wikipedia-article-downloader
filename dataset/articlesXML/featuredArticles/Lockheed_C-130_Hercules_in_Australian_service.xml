The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) has operated a total of forty-eight [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft. The type entered Australian service in December 1958, when [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron]] accepted the first of twelve C-130As, replacing its venerable [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]]. The acquisition made Australia the first operator of the Hercules after the United States. In 1966 the C-130As were joined by twelve C-130Es, which equipped [[No. 37 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron]]. The C-130As were replaced by twelve C-130Hs in 1978, and the C-130Es by twelve [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J Super Hercules]] in 1999. No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron became the RAAF's sole Hercules operator in 2006, when No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron transferred its C-130Hs prior to converting to [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster&amp;nbsp;III]] heavy transports. The C-130Hs were retired in November 2012, leaving the C-130J as the only model in Australian service.

The RAAF's first [[Airlift#Strategic airlift|strategic airlifter]], the Hercules has frequently been used to deliver disaster relief in Australia and the Pacific region, as well as to support military deployments overseas. The aircraft saw extensive service during the [[Vietnam War]], transporting troops and cargo to South East Asia and undertaking [[aeromedical evacuation]]. Nineteen of the RAAF's fleet of twenty-four C-130s took part in relief efforts in 1974–75 after [[Cyclone Tracy]] struck [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Since then, the Hercules have been involved in humanitarian missions to New Guinea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Bali, Sumatra, and New Zealand. They have also seen service during the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|Fijian coups]] in 1987, [[Operation Solace|operations in Somalia]] in 1993, [[International Force for East Timor|INTERFET]] operations in East Timor in 1999–2000, and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|wars in Afghanistan]] and [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] beginning in 2001. In over fifty years of Australian service, the Hercules have accumulated 800,000 flying hours.

==Acquisition==

===Initial selection and purchase===
At the end of World War II, the RAAF's prime transport aircraft was the twin-engined [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakota]]. In 1946, C-47 operations were concentrated under [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing]] and its three flying squadrons, [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;36]], [[No. 37 Squadron RAAF|37]], and [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|38]], based initially at [[RAAF Station Schofields]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parnell&quot;&gt;Parnell; Lynch, ''Australian Air Force Since 1911'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance&quot;&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the robustness and versatility of the Dakota, by the early 1950s the Air Force was looking for a replacement with greater cargo capacity and longer range, to better facilitate the deployment and supply of Australian forces.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 43, 416&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the RAAF embarked on a major re-equipment drive, following a shift in defence funding that favoured the Air Force. The Air Officer Commanding [[RAAF Air Command|Home Command]], Air Vice Marshal [[Alister Murdoch]], led a mission overseas to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RAAF C-130A Hercules (AWM 128872).jpeg|thumb|left|C-130A Hercules of No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron]]
Four British transports were considered: the [[Blackburn Beverley]], [[Bristol Freighter|Bristol 179B]], [[Bristol Britannia|Bristol 195]] and [[Short Brothers|Short]] PD 16/1. The mission also assessed the American [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar|Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar]], [[Fairchild C-123 Provider]] and [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130A Hercules]]. Of these types, the mission assessed that the Beverly, C-123 and C-130 could potentially meet the RAAF's requirements. Following further consideration of the options after their return to Australia, in early 1955 the members of the mission unanimously recommended that Hercules be procured, as the other two types did not meet some of the most important elements of the requirement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson_1990_102&quot;&gt;Wilson, '' Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the Australian Government was reluctant to fund any new equipment for the RAAF, and a decision to acquire twelve C-130s was not made until mid-1957. A contract for these aircraft was signed in October that year. The Australian C-130As were to be similar to those in service with the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), the main difference being the use of TF56-A-11 engines in the place of the usual TF56-A-1 and TF56-A-9s; these engines provided almost the same amount of power, but were modified to meet Australian fuel requirements. The total cost for the aircraft, initial crew training and support equipment was $US 36 million (equivalent to about 16 million Australian pounds).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, '' Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hercules represented a huge improvement over the C-47 in payload, range, speed and manoeuvrability, as well as offering cabin pressurisation, short-takeoff-and-landing capability, and bulk loading and despatch via its rear cargo door. The Government expressed concern over the price, at one stage proposing the purchase of only three aircraft, but eventually the Air Force won approval for the twelve that it wanted. Described by the official history of the post-war RAAF as second only to the [[General Dynamics F-111C]] as the &quot;most significant&quot; acquisition by the Air Force, the Hercules gave the Australian military its first [[Airlift#Strategic airlift|strategic airlift]] capability, which in years to come would provide a &quot;lifeline&quot; for deployments to Malaya, Vietnam, and other parts of South East Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo416&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 416–418&lt;/ref&gt; Australia was the first country other than the United States to operate the Hercules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance97&quot;&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF's C-130As were also the last of this variant to be built.&lt;ref name=Wilson_1990_103 /&gt;

RAAF crews began training on the Hercules in the middle of 1958 at [[Stewart Air National Guard Base|Stewart Air Force Base]] in [[Nashville]], Tennessee. Much of the training took place on a simulator, augmented by approximately fifty hours flying time in the aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo416&quot;/&gt; To cope with the Hercules' complexities, the aircrew category of [[flight engineer]], absent from the RAAF since World War&amp;nbsp;II, was reinstated. A new category, that of [[loadmaster]], was also instituted; airmen performing similar duties on Dakotas had done so on an ad hoc rather than a permanent basis, without a distinct category having been formalised.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt; A specialist crew member was needed to make weight-and-balance calculations and oversee loading and despatch for the Hercules' 20-tonne freight capacity (compared to three-and-a-half tonnes in a Dakota) and for its various cargo-delivery systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo416&quot;/&gt; A large hangar previously used to service seaplanes at [[RAAF Base Rathmines]] was disassembled and re-erected at [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales, where the C-130s would be based.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson_1990_103&quot;&gt;Wilson, '' Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later models and upgrades===
A decision to purchase another twelve C-130s was announced in November 1964. At this time the C-130As were being used to supply the Australian forces engaged in the [[Vietnam War]]. This task demonstrated that the RAAF had insufficient long-ranged transport aircraft to simultaneously support overseas deployments and meet the force's domestic requirements in Australia. As a result, the Government decided to order twelve C-130E Hercules as part of a package of acquisitions for the RAAF and Royal Australian Navy that also included ten [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]] and fourteen [[Grumman S-2 Tracker]] maritime patrol aircraft, as well as twelve [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748]] transports. The 14.7-million-pound contract for the new C-130s was signed on 9 February 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson_1990_105&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the concerns raised by the government over the cost of purchasing the C-130As, this expansion of the Hercules force gained ready agreement, due in no small part to the benefits for the armed services, particularly the [[Australian Army]], demonstrated by the first twelve aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo418&quot;/&gt; The long-serving C-130As were replaced by new Hercules in the late 1970s; twelve C-130Hs were ordered in June 1976 for a cost of $A86 million, and deliveries took place between July and October 1978.&lt;ref name=Wilson_1990_105 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Military Aircraft of Australia'', p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RAAF C-130J Hercules in the Middle East 2009.jpg|thumb|right|RAAF personnel undertaking preventive maintenance on a C-130J in the Middle East during January 2009]]
The RAAF's early model Hercules received several repairs and modifications during their service lives. During the early 1960s all of the C-130As were flown to the United States to receive new wing fuel tanks after the original tanks were affected by corrosion caused by tropical fungi and bacteria. Later that decade these aircraft received new panels on the upper surface of their wings after the original ones were found to be faulty.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, '' Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', pp. 119–122&lt;/ref&gt; The C-130Es were also fitted with strengthened wing centre boxes in the early 1970s after equivalent USAF aircraft were found to be suffering from greater-than-expected wing stress during operations in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson_1990_122&quot;&gt;Wilson, '' Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; During 1964 the C-130As received new [[Doppler radar|doppler navigation]] systems, and the C-130Es and Hs were fitted with [[ring laser gyroscope]] inertial navigation systems from 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, '' Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, four of No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron's C-130Hs were equipped with Electronic Warfare Self Protection packs, including radar and missile warning systems, and counter measures such as [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]] and flares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Hercs taking care of business|work=RAAF News|volume= 36|issue= 7|date=August 1994|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the decade, one of the C-130Hs was fitted with extensive [[signals intelligence]] equipment under the classified &quot;[[Project Peacemate]]&quot;; this aircraft was crewed by RAAF and [[Defence Signals Directorate]] personnel and its existence was never publicly confirmed by the Government. The modified C-130H was reported to still be active in the signals intelligence role in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;La Franchi, &quot;New ADF airlift studies&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=La Franchi|first=Peter|title=Australia to upgrade intelligence gathering pair|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/australia-to-upgrade-intelligence-gathering-pair-177966/|accessdate=7 July 2013|newspaper=Flight International|date=24 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The C-130Hs were also among the first Australian military aircraft to be modified to allow aircrew to operate them while wearing [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]].&lt;ref name=Pittaway_airlift_evolution_13 /&gt;

The Australian Government ordered twelve [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J Super Hercules]] in December 1995 and deliveries began during 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herculean_research&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Herculean research effort for a key Defence aircraft|magazine=Defence Science Australia|date=December 2011|volume=2|issue=4|pages=2–3|issn=1838-0093|url=http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/attachments/DSA-Dec2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the deal negotiated with [[Lockheed Martin]], seven of the RAAF's C-130Es were transferred to the company in return for a reduced price on the new aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaminski_81&quot;&gt;Kaminski, &quot;C-130J Super Hercules Part 2&quot;, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the order for the twelve C-130Js was placed, the Government also took out options for a further twenty seven Super Hercules, but these were not taken up; the options included seven [[airborne early warning and control]] and eight [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]] variants, as well as up to eight transports for the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=La Franchi|first=Peter|title=Australia looks at C-130J alternatives|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/australia-looks-at-c-130j-alternatives-56337/|accessdate=27 May 2013|newspaper=Flight International|date=22 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittaway_130J_upgrade_16&quot;&gt;Pittaway, &quot;C-130J upgrade&quot;, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF was the first operator of this C-130 variant, which was larger than earlier models and had a crew of only three (two pilots and a loadmaster) eliminating the navigator and flight engineer roles employed in earlier models.&lt;ref name=Herculean_research /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C-130&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A97.htm |title= Lockheed Hercules |publisher=RAAF Museum |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft initially suffered from a range of serious mechanical and software problems as well as a shortage of spare parts, and were assessed as &quot;experiencing significant operational shortfalls&quot; in a 2002 [[Australian National Audit Office]] report.&lt;ref&gt;Australian National Audit Office, ''Test and Evaluation of Major Defence Equipment Acquisitions'', pp. 95–97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, &quot;Hitting its straps&quot;, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] undertook considerable research into the C-130J design and developed improvements to the aircraft that addressed problems with excessive vibration.&lt;ref name=Herculean_research /&gt; The 2009 Defence white paper ''[[Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030]]'' called for the acquisition of two more C-130Js to partially replace the H variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Upgrade for RAAF C-130Js approved, but no sign of extra Js|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2010/02/upgrade-for-raaf-c-130js-approved-but-no-sign-of-extra-js/|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=Australian Aviation|date=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What the White Paper Means for the Royal Australian Air Force|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/whitepaper/mr/10_AirForceOverview.pdf|work=Press release|publisher=The Hon.

The C-130Js have been updated since entering service. All of the aircraft were fitted with [[radar warning receiver]]s by the end of 2012, and it is planned to equip the Hercules with [[Common Infrared Countermeasures program|Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures]] systems by 2016.&lt;ref name=Pittaway_130J_upgrade_17 /&gt; As of 2015, the Hercules' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the [[Link 16]] data exchange network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caldwell_71&quot;&gt;Caldwell, &quot;Big Lift&quot;, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the C-130s were also to be fitted with new high-speed airdrop ramps at the rear of their cabin, and will be cleared to drop larger loads.&lt;ref name=Caldwell_71 /&gt; The C-130J's operating software has also been upgraded over time, leading to improved performance. The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements.&lt;ref name=Pittaway_130J_upgrade_17 /&gt;

In March 2015 ''[[Australian Aviation (magazine)|Australian Aviation]]'' reported that, as part of the process of developing a new Defence White Paper, the Australian Government was considering purchasing two LC-130J Hercules fitted with landing skis and other equipment needed to allow the aircraft to operate in Antarctica. If acquired, these aircraft would be used to support the [[Australian Antarctic Division]]'s operations following the closure of the [[Wilkins Runway]] near [[Casey Station]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Caldwell_72&quot;&gt;Caldwell, &quot;Big Lift&quot;, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational service==

===Introduction into service===
The RAAF's twelve C-130As were picked up by their newly trained Australian pilots from the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] factory at [[Dobbins Air Reserve Base|Dobbins Air Force Base]], Georgia, and ferried to Australia in three groups between December 1958 and March 1959.&lt;ref name=Wilson_1990_105 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo418&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 418–420&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron, located at RAAF Base Richmond, became the first unit to operate the new aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance97&quot;/&gt; Almost immediately they established regular courier services within Australia and to [[RMAF Base Butterworth|RAAF Base Butterworth]] in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo418&quot;/&gt; These flights primarily involved transporting cargo, as Chief of the Air Staff [[Frederick Scherger]] directed in 1959 that the RAAF would continue to rely on chartered civil airliners to move military personnel on the grounds that these aircraft were better suited to the task and in wartime all the C-130s would be needed to supply troops near the front lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson_1990_117&quot;&gt;Wilson, '' Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1960 a Hercules flew the RAAF's first [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] missiles from the United States to Butterworth to equip the [[CAC Sabre]] fighters based there.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Sidewinders and Firestreaks'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Crew training was rigorous, and from mid-1960 involved the use of a simulator.

===Vietnam War era===
During the late 1960s, forty-two per cent of Hercules flying hours were devoted to Australian Army operations.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; The C-130s undertook long-range missions to support Australian forces fighting in the Vietnam War from 1965 until 1972. Following the deployment of the [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] to South Vietnam in early 1965, the RAAF began fortnightly C-130 flights into the country from June that year. These flights were initially conducted by C-130As, and carried high-priority cargo and passengers from Richmond to [[Vung Tau]] in South Vietnam via either Butterworth or Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 244–247&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of the supply flights into South Vietnam expanded in 1967 when [[No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron RAAF]], which was equipped with [[English Electric Canberra]] bombers, was deployed to [[Phan Rang–Tháp Chàm|Phan Rang]]. A large airlift codenamed Winter Grip was also conducted in mid-1967 to replace two Australian Army battalions, which had completed their year-long tour of duty, with a pair of fresh battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; The Hercules were called upon to support the withdrawal of the [[1st Australian Task Force]] (1&amp;nbsp;ATF) from South Vietnam, and Nos.&amp;nbsp;36 and 37 Squadrons undertook many sorties to fly equipment and personnel out of the country during 1971. In late 1972, C-130s were used to withdraw the last remaining Australian force in South Vietnam, the [[Australian Army Training Team Vietnam]]; the final elements of this force departed aboard two Hercules on 20&amp;nbsp;December 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as transport operations, the Hercules flew many evacuation flights out of Vietnam to transfer wounded or sick personnel to Australia, via Butterworth, for further treatment. These flights were initially conducted as part of the regular courier service, and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on stretchers.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 252–255&lt;/ref&gt; Separate evacuation flights began on 1&amp;nbsp;July 1966, and continued at fortnightly intervals until 1972; more flights were made during periods in which 1&amp;nbsp;ATF suffered heavy casualties. Although the operation was generally successful, only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C-130As to transport wounded personnel was published in ''[[The Medical Journal of Australia]]''. The C-130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A total of 3,164&amp;nbsp;patients had been transported to Australia by the time the C-130 evacuation flights ended in early 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 256–258&lt;/ref&gt; The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam to Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson_1990_125&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the RAAF's C-130s were redeployed to South Vietnam shortly before the end of the war in 1975. The rapid North Vietnamese advance during the [[1975 Spring Offensive|Spring Offensive]] displaced hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians, and the Australian Government deployed a detachment of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as part of an international aid effort coordinated by the United States. This force, which was designated Detachment&amp;nbsp;S, had an average strength of seven C-130s and about one hundred air and ground crew and was initially used to transport civilian refugees away from the front lines. After South Vietnamese soldiers were reported to have been transported alongside civilians, Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] directed that the Hercules were to only carry humanitarian cargo.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, &quot;After the Fall&quot;, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; As the North Vietnamese advanced on Saigon, Detachment&amp;nbsp;S was moved to Bangkok in Thailand, but continued to fly into South Vietnam each day. Overall, Detachment&amp;nbsp;S had carried 1,100&amp;nbsp;refugees and 900&amp;nbsp;tonnes of supplies by the end of the war. On 4&amp;nbsp;and 17&amp;nbsp;April, aircraft of the detachment flew 271&amp;nbsp;orphaned children to Bangkok as part of the US-led [[Operation Babylift]].&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, &quot;After the Fall&quot;, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; In late April, two of No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron's C-130Es were assigned to the United Nations to transport supplies throughout South East Asia; this force was designated Detachment&amp;nbsp;N. The C-130Es began operations on 3&amp;nbsp;May, and were mainly used to fly supplies into Laos. The aircraft transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore; by the time this mission ended in early June, the two Hercules had conducted 91&amp;nbsp;sorties for the UN.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, &quot;After the Fall&quot;, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft of Detachment&amp;nbsp;S evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, as well as Saigon, shortly before they fell to [[Khmer Rouge]] and North Vietnamese forces in April 1975, after which the force returned to Australia. Detachment&amp;nbsp;N also evacuated the Australian embassy in Vientiane, Laos, during early June 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance pp. 100–102&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, &quot;After the Fall&quot;, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Vietnam tasks===
In the years after the end of the Vietnam War, the Hercules continued to take part in military exercises and support overseas peacekeeping commitments. They also became well known in the Southern Pacific after being called on for relief following natural disasters, including tidal waves in New Guinea, cyclones in the Solomon Islands and Tonga, and fires and floods in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; The Hercules played a significant part in the evacuation of civilians following [[Cyclone Tracy]] in 1974–75; a No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron C-130E was the first aircraft to touch down in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] following the disaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance pp. 100–102&quot;/&gt; Eight of No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron's aircraft were involved in the relief effort, flying over 550&amp;nbsp;hours, and carrying 2,864&amp;nbsp;passengers and almost 800,000&amp;nbsp;lbs of cargo, while No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron contributed 11&amp;nbsp;aircraft, flying 700&amp;nbsp;hours, and carrying 4,400 passengers and 1,300,000&amp;nbsp;lbs of cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|work=RAAF News|volume= 37 |issue= 1| date=Jan–Feb 1995|page=7|title=Looking back: 20 years ago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 19&amp;nbsp;January 1978 a C-130E returning to Australia from Butterworth was used to intercept a drug-smuggling aircraft near Darwin; the smuggler eventually landed at [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]], and was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Clark; Clarke, ''First on the Scene'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; After clocking up 147,000&amp;nbsp;accident-free flying hours over the course of 20&amp;nbsp;years, No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron's C-130As were replaced in 1978 by C-130H models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance97&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C-130&quot;/&gt; The C-130Hs were primarily used as tactical air lifters throughout their service with the RAAF, and worked closely with the Army's special forces units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittaway_airlift_evolution_13&quot;&gt;Pittaway, &quot;Airlift evolution&quot;, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1st Commando Company.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers from the 1st Commando Company parachute with inflatable boats from an RAAF C-130H into Shoalwater Bay, May 2001]]
The disposal of the C-130As took almost a decade, with the process being subject to a police investigation. Attempts to sell the Hercules by tender during 1978 and 1979 were unsuccessful, and the American law firm Ford and Vlahos was appointed the sales agent for the aircraft in 1981. One was sold to the French Government in 1983 and subsequently transferred to the [[Chadian Air Force]]. Another two Hercules were sold to the Columbian charter company Aviaco in 1983, but the US [[United States Department of State|State Department]] vetoed the deal shortly before it was to have been completed over suspicions that the aircraft would be used to smuggle drugs into the United States. A C-130A was transferred to the newly established company [[International Air Aid]] and leased to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cross]] to fly humanitarian supplies into Ethiopia during 1986, but this contract was cancelled after the C-130's pilot was accused by the Ethiopian government of photographing a military area. The [[Australian Federal Police]] eventually charged two people with defrauding the Commonwealth and conspiracy in relation to these attempts to dispose of the C-130As. Eventually, four of the C-130As were sold to [[2GO (Air)|Aboitiz Air Transport Corporation]] in May 1988 and another four were acquired by the [[Fowler Aeronautical Corporation]] the next year. Two of the remaining three aircraft were retained by the RAAF for training and heritage purposes, and the final C-130A was scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', pp. 109–113, 150&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1978, a C-130H became the first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica, at [[McMurdo Sound]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Royalnce105&quot;&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In January–February 1979, two No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron C-130Es evacuated Australian and other foreign embassy staff from [[Tehran]], shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the [[Iranian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = RAAF Evacuation of Australians from Iran, 1979 | magazine = Pathfinder|issue= 64| date = April 2007| url =http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/admin/productfiles/publication/materials/313/pf64_apr07.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During April 1982, a C-130H was fitted with [[aerial firefighting]] equipment acquired from the [[United States Forest Service]] for trials purposes; several Hercules later used this equipment to fight bushfires.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April 1983, 23 of the RAAF's Hercules performed a formation flight over Sydney; the remaining aircraft was to have participated in this flight but was diverted to conduct a search-and-rescue task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximum effort by Hercules|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=96|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hercules' twelve-hour endurance and ability to drop survival equipment over land or sea made it a useful aircraft for such missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance pp. 100–102&quot;/&gt; In 1986, No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron transported the [[Popemobile]]s during [[John Paul&amp;nbsp;II]]'s tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a [[Murray Grey]] stud bull presented to the Chinese Government in 1973, kangaroos and sheep for Malaysia, and archaeological exhibits from China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance pp. 100–102&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark; Clarke, ''First on the Scene'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Iraqi [[invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990, No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing prepared to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000&amp;nbsp;Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia in the event that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95&amp;nbsp;Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''Australia and the 'New World Order{{'}}'', pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of the Australia's [[Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War|contribution]] to the ensuing [[Gulf War]] was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] worsened and required an evacuation operation.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''Australia and the 'New World Order{{'}}'', p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''Australia and the 'New World Order{{'}}'', p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to [[Muscat, Oman]], from January 1991, and also transported a naval [[Clearance Diving Team (RAN)|Clearance Diving Team]] to Muscat late in the month.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''Australia and the 'New World Order{{'}}'', pp. 449, 460&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|work= RAAF News|volume= 34|issue= 6|title=Symbol of success|date= July 1992|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four C-130E sorties were also conducted to drop food and other humanitarian supplies to refugees on 17 and 18&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Warden to Tanger'', pp. 7–10&lt;/ref&gt; On 19&amp;nbsp;September a C-130 dropped a [[Special Air Service Regiment]] (SAS) team near the East Timorese capital of [[Dili]] ahead of the arrival of the main INTERFET force the next day. From 20&amp;nbsp;September, thirteen RAAF Hercules (designated No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing Detachment&amp;nbsp;B) and transport aircraft from several other countries flew troops and supplies into East Timor. These aircraft also dropped humanitarian supplies to refugees who had fled to mountainous regions. The poor condition of most East Timorese airfields and the potential threat of being fired upon by pro-Indonesian militia were constant dangers throughout this operation.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Warden to Tanger'', pp. 13–19&lt;/ref&gt; 

The support arrangements for the RAAF's Hercules were reformed during 1999 and 2000.

RAAF C-130s continued to support operations in and around Australia during the early 2000s.
