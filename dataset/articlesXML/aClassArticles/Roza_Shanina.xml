Shanina volunteered for the military after the death of her brother in 1941 and chose to be a [[marksman]] on the front line. Praised for her shooting accuracy, Shanina was capable of precisely hitting enemy personnel and making doublets (two target hits by two rounds fired in quick succession).

In 1944, a Canadian newspaper described Shanina as &quot;the unseen terror of East Prussia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gwAvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-9sFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3207,3420642&amp;dq=shanina+terror+of+east+prussia&amp;hl=en | title = Red Army Girl Unseen Terror of East Prussia|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] | date = 20 September 1944 | accessdate = 2010-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the first Soviet female sniper to be awarded the [[Order of Glory]] and was the first servicewoman of the [[3rd Belorussian Front]] to receive it. Shanina was [[killed in action]] during the [[East Prussian Offensive]] while shielding the severely wounded commander of an artillery unit. Shanina's bravery received praise already during her lifetime, but came at odds with the Soviet policy of sparing snipers from heavy fights. Her combat diary was first published in 1965.

==Early life==

Roza Shanina was born on 3 April 1924 in the Russian village of [[Ustyansky District|Yedma]] ([[Arkhangelsk Oblast]]) to Anna Alexeyevna Shanina, a [[kolkhoz]] milkmaid, and Georgiy (Yegor) Mikhailovich Shanin, a logger who had been disabled by a wound received during [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Алёшина 2010 14&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Алёшина|Попышева|2010|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roza was reportedly named after the Marxist revolutionary [[Rosa Luxemburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ki-gazeta.ru/rubrics/9/2169.html | script-title=ru:Что в имени тебе моем? | trans_title = What is in my name for you? | work=Краснодарские известия | language = Russian | author = Зара Хушт | accessdate = 2012-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had six siblings: one sister Yuliya and five brothers: Mikhail, Fyodor, Sergei, Pavel and Marat. The Shanins also raised three orphans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Порошина 1995 52&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Порошина|1995|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roza was above average height, with light brown hair and blue eyes, and spoke in a [[Northern Russian dialects|Northern Russian dialect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.armoury-online.ru/links/useful_files/shanina/ | script-title=ru:Снайпер Роза Шанина | trans_title = Sniper Roza Shanina|publisher =Armoury Online | language = Russian | accessdate = 2010-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing four classes of elementary school in Yedma, Shanina continued her education in the village of [[Bereznik]]. As there was no school transport at the time, when she was in grades five through seven Roza had to walk {{convert|13|km|mi}} to Bereznik to attend middle school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Алёшина 2010 14&quot;/&gt; On Saturdays, Shanina again went to Bereznik to take care of her ill aunt Agnia Borisova.&lt;ref name=&quot;Порошина 1995 52&quot;/&gt;

At the age of fourteen, Shanina, against her parents' wishes, walked {{convert|200|km|mi}} across the [[taiga]] to the rail station and travelled to [[Arkhangelsk]] to study at the college there&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; (the trek was later attested by Shanina's school teacher Alexander Makaryin).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanina left home with little money and almost no possessions;&lt;ref name=&quot;Izvestia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nord.pomorsu.ru/files/nom.pdf | script-title=ru:Неизвестное письмо | trans_title = The Unknown Letter | work=Известия русского Севера | language = Russian | date = September 2010 | accessdate = 2012-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and before moving to the college dormitory she lived with her elder brother Fyodor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Izvestia&quot; /&gt; Later in her combat diary Shanina would recall Arkhangelsk's stadium Dinamo, and the cinemas, Ars and Pobeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; Shanina's friend Anna Samsonova remembered that Roza sometimes returned from her friends in [[Ustyansky District]] to her college dormitory between 2:00 and 3:00 am. As the doors were locked by that time, the other students tied several bedsheets together to help Roza climb into her room.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pravda&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pravda.ru/politics/military/defence/11-05-2005/51017-samsonova-0/ | script-title=ru:Память Победы: она была подругой легендарного снайпера Розы Шаниной | trans_title = The Memory of Victory: She was a Friend of Legendary Sniper Roza Shanina | work=[[Pravda]] | language = Russian | date = 11 May 2005 | accessdate = 2011-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Shanina became a member of the Soviet youth movement [[Komsomol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Comlist&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.podvignaroda.ru/filter/filterimage?path=VS/095/033-0686044-3399%2B004-3398/00000265.jpg&amp;id=20489237&amp;id=20489237&amp;id1=41a7fae3a516e1250e2531c6bb3446e6 | script-title=ru:Наградной лист | trans_title = Commendation list (of Roza Shanina on her 3rd class Order of Glory)|publisher =Podvignaroda.ru | language = Russian | date = 17 April 1944 | accessdate = 2011-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Soviet secondary education institutes introduced tuition fees, and the scholarship fund was cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;APC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pomorsu.ru/avpu/history/08.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415174809/http://avpu.pomorsu.ru/history/08.htm |archivedate=2012-04-15 | title = Снайпер Роза Шанина [Sniper Roza Shanina] | last = Овсянкин | first = Евгений | publisher = Arkhangelsk Pedagogical College| location = Arkhangelsk | language = Russian | accessdate = 2008-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanina received little financial support from home and on 11 September 1941, she took a job in kindergarten No. 2 (lately known as Beryozka) in Arkhangelsk, with which she was offered a free apartment.&lt;ref name=&quot;APC&quot; /&gt; She studied in the evenings and worked in the kindergarten during the daytime. The children liked Shanina and their parents appreciated her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Izvestia&quot; /&gt; Shanina graduated from college in the 1941–42 academic year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://avpu.pomorsu.ru/history/07.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722102631/http://avpu.pomorsu.ru/history/07.htm|archivedate=2012-07-22|title = В годы Великой Отечественной&amp;nbsp;... | trans_title = In the years of the Great Patriotic War&amp;nbsp;... | last = Овсянкин | first = Евгений | publisher = Arkhangelsk Pedagogical College | language = Russian | accessdate = 2010-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the Soviet Union was in the grip of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].

Following the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Arkhangelsk was bombed by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', and Shanina and other townspeople were involved in firefighting and mounted voluntary vigils on rooftops to protect the kindergarten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topwar&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://topwar.ru/13043-roza-shanina-krasavica-snayper-iz-arhangelskoy-oblasti.html | script-title=ru:Роза Шанина - красавица-снайпер из Архангельской области| trans_title = Roza Shanina - a sniper beauty from Arkhangelsk Oblast | publisher =Topwar.ru | author =Елена Гордеева| language = Russian | date = 3 April 2012  | accessdate = 2012-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanina's two elder brothers had volunteered for the military. In December 1941, a [[death notification]] was received for her 19-year-old brother Mikhail, who had died during the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. In response, Shanina went to the [[military commissariat]] to ask for permission to serve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Алёшина 2010 14&quot;/&gt; Two more of Shanina's brothers died in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;APC&quot; /&gt; At that time the Soviet Union had begun deploying female snipers because they had flexible limbs, and it was believed that they were patient, careful and cunning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pegler|2006|pp=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1942, Soviet women between the ages of 16 and 45 became eligible for the [[military draft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History of World War II | publisher = Marshall Cavendish | year = 2004 | page = 587 | isbn = 978-0-7614-7482-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Shanina was not drafted that month as the local military commissariat wanted to pinion her out of war's way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Мамонов 2011 15&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She first learned to shoot at a [[shooting range]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Мамонов 2011 15&quot;/&gt; On 22 June 1943, while still living in the dormitory, Shanina was accepted into the [[Vsevobuch]] program for universal military training. After Shanina's several applications, the military commissariat finally allowed her to enroll in the Central Female Sniper Academy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; where she met Aleksandra &quot;Sasha&quot; Yekimova and Kaleriya &quot;Kalya&quot; Petrova, who became her closest friends, with Shanina calling them &quot;the vagrant three&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; Honed to a fine point, Shanina scored highly in training and graduated from the academy with honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Алёшина|Попышева|2010|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was offered to stay as an instructor there, but refused due to a call of duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941–1945 a total of 2,484 Soviet female snipers were deployed for the war and their combined tally of kills is estimated to be at least 11,280.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://gunmagazine.com.ua/index.php?id=141| script-title=ru:Неженское дело? | trans_title = A Non-Woman Business?|publisher= Gun Magazine| first = Александр | last = Ручко | language = Russian | accessdate = 2013-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the momentous victory in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] the Soviet troops proceeded to nationwide [[counter-offensive]]s and Shanina on 2 April 1944 joined the [[184th Rifle Division]], where a separate female sniper platoon had been formed. Shanina was appointed a commander of that platoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;APC&quot;/&gt; Three days later, southeast of [[Vitebsk]], Shanina killed her first German soldier. In Shanina's own words, recorded by an anonymous author, her legs gave way upon that first encounter and she slid down into the trench, saying, &quot;I've killed a man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pravda Severa1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pravdasevera.ru/?id=20021 | title = Навеки&amp;nbsp;– двадцатилетняя | trans_title = Forever Twenty Aged|work=[[Pravda Severa]] | first = Лидия | last = Мельницкая | language = Russian | date = 9 February 2006 | accessdate = 2010-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned, the other women ran up saying, &quot;That was a fascist you finished off!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pravda Severa1&quot; /&gt; Seven months later, Shanina wrote in her diary that she was now killing the enemy in cold blood and saw the meaning of her life in her actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; She wrote that if she had to do everything over again, she would still strive to enter the sniper academy and would go to the front again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ural&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://magazines.russ.ru/ural/2010/3/go11.html | title = Вместо легких лодочек&amp;nbsp;– кирзачи солдатские.. | trans_title = Kirza Boots Instead of Court Shoes | first = Владимир | last = Головин | work=Урал | language = Russian | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2010-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For her actions in the battle for the village of Kozyi Gory ([[Smolensk Oblast]]), Shanina was awarded her first military distinction, the [[Order of Glory]] 3rd Class on 17 April 1944. She became the first Soviet female sniper and the first servicewoman of the 3rd Belorussian Front to receive that order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molchanov&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.airaces.narod.ru/snipers/womans5.htm | title = Девушки&amp;nbsp;– снайперы 5-й армии | trans_title = Female Snipers of the 5th Army (from the compilation ''Born by War'') | author = М.

When [[Operation Bagration]] commenced in the [[Vitebsk]] region on 22 June 1944, it was decided that female snipers would be withdrawn. They voluntarily continued to support the advancing infantry anyway,&lt;ref name=&quot;Molchanov&quot; /&gt; and despite the Soviet policy of sparing snipers, Shanina asked to be sent to the front line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snipers&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.a-z.ru/women_cd2/12/4/i80_207.htm | script-title=ru:Жажда боя | trans_title = Thirst for battle | author = Пётр Молчанов | year = 1976 |work= Снайперы (compilation) | publisher = OAO &quot;Molodaya gvardiya&quot; | location = Moscow | language = Russian | accessdate = 2008-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although her request was refused, she went anyway.

Shanina also wrote twice to [[Joseph Stalin]] with the same request.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 26 to 28 June 1944, Shanina participated in the elimination of the [[Encirclement|encircled]] German troops near [[Vitebsk]]&lt;ref name=&quot;OoG&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.podvignaroda.ru/filter/filterimage?path=VS/256/033-0690155-3712%2B011-3709/00000279.jpg&amp;id=32234433&amp;id=32234433&amp;id1=9dcbeeaca20e07e4bd5ddde547ce03cd | script-title=ru:Наградной лист | trans_title = Commendation list [of Roza Shanina on her 2nd class Order of Glory] | publisher = Podvignaroda.ru | language = Russian | date = September 16, 1944 | accessdate = 2011-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Vitebsk–Orsha Offensive]]. As the Soviet army advanced further westward, from 8 to 13 July of the same year, Shanina and her sisters-in-arms took part in the [[Vilnius Offensive|struggle for Vilnius]],&lt;ref name=&quot;APC&quot; /&gt; which had been under German occupation since 24 June 1941. The Germans were finally driven out from Vilnius on 13 July 1944. During the Soviet summer offensives of that year Shanina managed to capture three Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt;

From her time at the military academy, Shanina became known for her ability to score doublets (two target hits made in quick succession).&lt;ref name=&quot;Topwar&quot;/&gt; During one period she crawled through a muddy communications trench each day at dawn to a specially camouflaged pit which overlooked German-controlled territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;OC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gwAvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-9sFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3207,3420642&amp;dq=shanina+terror+of+east+prussia&amp;hl=en | title = Red Army Girl Unseen Terror of East Prussia|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] | date = 20 September 1944 | accessdate = 2010-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote, &quot;the unconditional requirement{{mdash}}to outwit the enemy and kill him{{mdash}}became an irrevocable law of my hunt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanina successfully used [[counter-sniper tactics]] against a German [[cuckoo (sniper)|cuckoo sniper]] hidden in a tree, by waiting until dusk when the space between the tree branches would be backlit by sunlight and the sniper's nest became visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, Shanina also made use of [[selective fire]] from a submachine gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Алёшина 2010 16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Алёшина|Попышева|2010|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roza Shanina's diary.jpg|thumb|One of Shanina's notebooks]]

Shanina enjoyed writing and would often send letters to her home village and to her friends in Arkhangelsk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pravda Severa1&quot; /&gt; She started writing a combat diary; although diaries were strictly prohibited in the Soviet military,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/ortenberg_di3/07.html | script-title=ru:Сорок третий | trans_title = The Forty Third | publisher = Militera | first = Давид | last = Ортенберг | language = Russian | accessdate = 2011-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there were some furtive exceptions, such as ''The Front Diary'' of Izrael Kukuyev and ''The Chronicle of War'' of [[Muzagit Hayrutdinov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://strana.klops.ru/news/27428.html|archivedate=2012-03-02| script-title=ru:Фронтовой дневник Кукуева И.

After Shanina's death, the diary, consisting of three thick notebooks, was kept by the war correspondent Pyotr Molchanov for twenty years in [[Kiev]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Мамонов 2011 4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abridged version was published in the magazine ''[[Yunost]]'' in 1965, and the diary was transferred to the Regional Museum of Arkhangelsk Oblast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Мамонов 2011 4&quot;/&gt; Several of Shanina's letters and some data from her sniper log have also been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1944 advancing Soviet troops had reached the Soviet border with [[East Prussia]] and by 31 August of that year Shanina's battle count reached 42 kills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; The following month the [[Šešupė River]] was crossed. Shanina's [[184th Rifle Division]] became the first Soviet unit to enter East Prussia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Jones | first =Michael| title =Total War: From Stalingrad to Berlin | publisher =Hachette UK | year =2011 | page =&lt;!-- no page numeration, but accessible at Google Books --&gt; | isbn =1-84854-246-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, two Canadian newspapers, the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' and ''[[Leader-Post]]'', reported that according to an official dispatch from the Šešupė River front, Shanina killed five Germans in one day as she crouched in a sniper hideout.&lt;ref name=&quot;OC&quot; /&gt; Later in September her sniper tally had reached 46 kills,&lt;ref name=&quot;OC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://secure.flickr.com/photos/36919288@N08/4468447519/ | title = Russ Girl Terror of East Prussia | work=[[U.S. News]] | date = September 1944 | accessdate = 2010-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 15 were made on German soil and seven during an offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pomorfilm.ru/node/8406 | title = Репортаж &quot;Забытый герой&amp;nbsp;– Роза Шанина&quot; | trans_title = &quot;The Forgotten Hero&amp;nbsp;– Roza Shanina&quot; report (03:08 time mark) | publisher = Pomorfilm.ru | language = Russian | accessdate = 2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September, ''Unichtozhim Vraga'' credited Shanina with 51 hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molchanov&quot; /&gt; In the third quarter of 1944, Shanina was given a short [[furlough]] and visited Arkhangelsk. She returned to the front on October 17 for one day, and later received an honourable certificate from the Central Committee of [[Komsomol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; On 16 September 1944, Shanina was awarded her second military distinction, the Order of Glory 2nd Class for intrepidity and bravery displayed in various battles against the Germans in that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;OoG&quot; /&gt;

On 26 October 1944 Shanina became eligible for the Order of Glory 1st Class for her actions in a battle near Schlossberg (now [[Dobrovolsk]]), but ultimately received the [[Medal &quot;For Courage&quot; (Russia)|Medal for Courage]] instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Мамонов 2011 13&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanina was awarded the medal on 27 December for the gallant posture displayed during a German counter-offensive on 26 October. There Shanina fought together with Captain [[Igor Aseyev]], a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], and witnessed his death on 26 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanina, who served as an assistant platoon commander, was ordered to commit the female snipers to combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Мамонов 2011 13&quot;/&gt; She was among the first female snipers to receive the Medal for Courage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snipers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dshinin.ru/Upload_Books3/Books/2011-08-27/201108272026341.pdf | script-title=ru:Награды девушкам-снайперам | trans_title = Awards for sniper girls | work=[[Krasnaya Zvezda]] | language = Russian |page=3 | date = 17 January 1945 | accessdate = 2011-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlossberg was finally retaken from Germans by the troops of the [[3rd Belorussian Front]] on 16 January 1945 during the [[Insterburg–Königsberg Operation]].

On 12 December 1944, an enemy sniper shot Shanina in her right shoulder. She wrote in her diary that she had not felt the pain, &quot;the shoulder was just scalded with something hot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; Although the injury, which Shanina described as &quot;two small holes&quot;, seemed minor to her, she needed an operation and was incapacitated for several days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; She reported in her diary that the previous day she had a prophetic dream in which she was wounded in exactly the same place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;/&gt;

On 8 January 1945 [[Nikolay Ivanovich Krylov|Nikolai Krylov]] formally allowed Shanina to participate in front-line combat, albeit with great reluctance: previously Shanina was denied that permission by the commander of the 184th Rifle Division and the military council of the [[5th Army (Soviet Union)|5th Army]] as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;/&gt; Five days later, the Soviets launched the [[East Prussian Offensive]], which prompted heavy fighting in East Prussia. By 15 January, travelling with divisional logistics, Shanina reached the East Prussian town of Eydtkuhnen (now [[Chernyshevskoye]]), where she used white military camouflage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; Several days later, she experienced [[friendly fire]] from a [[Katyusha rocket launcher]] and wrote in her diary, &quot;Now I understand why the Germans are so afraid of Katyushas. What a fire!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; At the border of East Prussia, Shanina killed 26 enemy soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shanina&quot; /&gt; The last unit she served in was the 144th Rifle Division. According to the online Book of Memory of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Shanina served in the 205th Special Motorized Rifle Battalion of that division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ipc.antat.ru/Ref/fields.asp?f=%D8%E0%ED%E8%ED%E0&amp;s=%D0%EE%E7%E0&amp;l=&amp;y=&amp;m=&amp;r=&amp;b=&amp;np=true&amp;p=1&amp;ID={E2E5335A-A0A0-499A-8354-6EFFAAF8E26A}| title = Результаты поиска по сводной базе&amp;nbsp;– все поля | trans_title = Database search results | publisher = Interregional Informational and Search Center | language = Russian | accessdate = 2010-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanina had hoped to go to university after the war, or if that was not possible, to raise [[orphan]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;/&gt;

In the course of her tour of duty Shanina was [[mentioned in despatches]] several times.

On 16 January 1945 Shanina wrote in her combat diary: &quot;What I've actually done? No more than I have to as a Soviet man, having stood up to defend the motherland.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;APC&quot; /&gt; She also wrote, &quot;The essence of my happiness is fighting for the happiness of others. It's strange, why is it that in grammar, the word &quot;happiness&quot; can only be singular? That is counter to its meaning, after all.&amp;nbsp;... If it turns necessary to die for the common happiness, then I'm braced to.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ural&quot; /&gt;

=== Death ===
[[File:Death notification of Roza Shanina.jpg|thumb|[[Death notification]] sent to Shanina's mother by the 205th Separate Medical and Sanitary Battalion.]]
In the face of the East Prussian Offensive, the Germans tried to strengthen the localities they controlled against great odds. In a diary entry dated 16 January 1945, Shanina wrote that despite her wish to be in a safer place, some unknown force was drawing her to the front line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same entry she wrote that she had no fear and that she had even agreed to go &quot;to a melee combat.&quot; The next day, Shanina wrote in a letter that she might be on the verge of being killed because her battalion had lost 72 out of 78 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;APC&quot; /&gt; Her last diary entry reports that German fire had become so intense that the Soviet troops, including herself, had sheltered inside [[self-propelled gun]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; On 27 January Shanina was severely injured while shielding a wounded artillery officer. She was found by two soldiers disemboweled, with her chest torn open by a [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shell fragment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Мамонов 2011 59&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts to save her, Shanina died the following day&lt;ref name=&quot;Мамонов 2011 59&quot;/&gt; near the Richau estate (later a Soviet settlement of Telmanovka), {{convert|3|km|mi}} southeast of the East Prussian village of Ilmsdorf ({{Interlanguage link multi|Novobobruysk|de|3=Nowo-Bobruisk}}). Nurse Yekaterina Radkina remembered Shanina telling her that she regretted having done so little.&lt;ref name=&quot;Мамонов 2011 59&quot;/&gt; By the day of Shanina's death the Soviets had overtaken several major East Prussian localities, including [[Tilsit]], [[Insterburg]] and [[Pillau]], and approached [[Königsberg]]. Recalling the moment Shanina's mother received notification of her daughter's death, her brother Marat wrote: &quot;I clearly remembered mother's eyes. They weren't teary anymore.&amp;nbsp;... 'That's all, that's all'—she repeated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Порошина|1995|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanina was buried under a spreading pear tree on the shore of the Alle River—now called the [[Łyna River|Lava]]—&lt;ref name=&quot;APC&quot; /&gt; and was later reinterred in the settlement of [[Znamensk, Kaliningrad Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.obd-memorial.ru/Image2/imagelink?path=62349d84-76cb-4497-995a-530dcb063b30 | script-title=ru:Информация из списков захоронения | trans_title = Information from the lists of burials | publisher = Obd-memorial | language = Russian | accessdate = 2011-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous honours==
In 1964–65 a renewed interest in Shanina arose in the Soviet press, largely due to the publication of her diary. The newspaper ''Severny Komsomolets'' asked Shanina's contemporaries to write what they knew about her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pravda Severa1&quot; /&gt; Streets in [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Shangaly]] and [[Stroyevskoye]] were named after her, and the village of Yedma has a museum dedicated to Shanina. The local school where she studied in 1931–35 has a commemorative plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pomorie.ru/news/vmesto-uchebnikov-----vintovka.-vmesto-uchiteley-- | title = Вместо учебников&amp;nbsp;– винтовка.

In 1985, the Council of Veterans of the Russian Central Women Sniper Academy unsuccessfully requested the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] to posthumously bestow the Order of Glory 1st Class on Shanina&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which would have made her a Full Cavalier of that order). In the same year, Russian author [[Nikolai Zhuravlyov]] published the book ''Posle boya vernulas'' (''Returned After Battle''). Its title refers to Shanina's words, &quot;I will return after the battle,&quot; which she uttered after receiving a note from her battalion commander urging her to return to the rear immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shanina&quot; /&gt; Verses have been composed about Shanina, such as those by writer [[Nikolai Nabitovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ustyany.net/news/1/sub1/id/86/ | script-title=ru:Из поколения победителей | trans_title = From the generation of victors | publisher = Ustyany.net | language = Russian | accessdate = 2011-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small memorial [[stele]] dedicated to Shanina (part of a three-piece monument) was erected in Bogdanovsky settlement, Ustyansky District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.pomorie.ru/news/noviy-pamyatnik-3-kavaleram-ordena---slavi---1 | script-title=ru:Новый памятник 3 кавалерам ордена &quot;Славы&quot;| trans_title = A new monument to the three recipients of the Order of Glory| publisher = Pomorie.ru | language = Russian |date=2 September 2010| accessdate = 2013-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Shanina's name appeared on the war memorial stone of the [[Siberian State Technological University]], although there is no evidence she had any affiliation with it during her life. Russian author Viktor Logvinov controversially wrote in the 1970s that Shanina had studied in the Siberian Forestry Institute and that she was the daughter of an &quot;old [[Krasnoyarsk]] communist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Логвинов| first = Виктор| title = В бой идут сибиряки: красноярцы на фронтах и в тылу Великой Отечественной войны | publisher = Красноярск : Кн. изд-во| year =1977| page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was continued by Krasnoyarsk publications in later years, particularly in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | script-title=ru:Красноярцы в Великой Отечественной войне: материалы региональной межвузовской научной конференции, посвященной 60-летию победы СССР в Великой Отечественной войне, 20 апреля 2005 года| language=Russian|publisher = Краснояр. гос. ун-т, Гос. унив. науч. б-ка Краснояр. края | year = 2005 | page = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a wall of memory, featuring [[graffiti]] portraits of six Russian war honorees, including Roza Shanina, was opened in Arkhangelsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://pravdasevera.ru/agency/society/stena_pamyati_ukrashaet_chumbarovku/| script-title=ru:&quot;Стена памяти&quot; украшает Чумбаровку|publisher =''Pravda Severa''|date=16 September 2013| language=Russian|accessdate = 31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character and personal life ==

The war correspondent Pyotr Molchanov, who had frequently met Shanina at the front, described her as a person of unusual will with a genuine, bright nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pravda Severa1&quot; /&gt; Shanina described herself as &quot;boundlessly and recklessly talky&quot; during her college years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pravda&quot; /&gt; She typified her own character as like that of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet, painter and writer [[Mikhail Lermontov]], deciding, like him, to act as she saw fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; Shanina dressed modestly and liked to play volleyball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Полоскова | first = А. | script-title=ru:Воспоминания о семье Шаниных| journal =Этот день мы приближали как могли...: устьяки на фронте и в тылу | page = 57 | publisher =Устьян. район. краевед. музей | language = Russian | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shanina's sister-in-arms Lidiya Vdovina, Roza used to sing her favourite war song &quot;Oy tumany moi, rastumany&quot; (&quot;O My Mists&quot;) each time she cleaned her weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pravda Severa1&quot; /&gt; Shanina had a straightforward character&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Козлова | first = А. | script-title=ru:Никогда не забудем | journal = Этот день мы приближали как могли...: устьяки на фронте и в тылу | page = 56 | publisher = Устьян. район. краевед. музей | language = Russian | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and valued courage and the absence of egotism in people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; She once told a story when &quot;about half a hundred frenzied fascists with wild cries&quot; attacked a trench accommodating twelve female snipers, including Shanina: &quot;Some fell from our well-aimed bullets, some we finished with our bayonets, grenades, shovels, and some we took prisoners, having restrained their arms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pravda Severa1&quot; /&gt;

Shanina's personal life was thwarted by war. On 10 October 1944, she wrote in her diary, &quot;I can't accept that Misha Panarin doesn't live anymore. What a good guy! [He] has been killed&amp;nbsp;... He loved me, I know, and I him&amp;nbsp;... My heart is heavy, I'm twenty, but I have no close [male] friend&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; In November 1944, Shanina wrote that she &quot;is flogging into her head that [she] loves&quot; a man named Nikolai, although he &quot;doesn't shine in upbringing and education&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; In the same entry she wrote that she did not think about marriage because &quot;it's not the time now&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; She later wrote that she &quot;had it out&quot; with Nikolai and &quot;wrote him a note in the sense of 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one{{'}}&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armoury&quot; /&gt; Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with sombre tones, Shanina wrote that she &quot;cannot find a solace&quot; now and is &quot;of no use to anyone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Мамонов|Порошина|2011|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
