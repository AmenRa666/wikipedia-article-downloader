==GA passed==
I have passed this article according to the requirements of the [[WP:WIAGA|GA critera]]. I made a few minor corrections, but other than that the article looks fine. The article is well-sourced, and maintains a NPOV. If possible consider adding another image. Keep up the good work, and I hope you continue to bring articles up to GA quality. To anyone that reads this review, please consider helping with the current backlog at [[WP:GAN]] by reviewing an article or two. Any new editors who assist are greatly appreciated. Instructions can be found [[Wikipedia:Reviewing good articles|here]]. I have updated the article history to reflect this review. If you have any further questions about the review, let me know on my talk page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Happy editing! --[[User:Nehrams2020|Nehrams2020]] ([[User talk:Nehrams2020|talk]]) 07:11, 17 November 2007 (UTC)

==Is that really William Hamilton?==
On the image:  Chernow's book says that portrait is of Philip Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton's eldest son, who was killed in a duel in 1801.  Is the image mislabeled, or was Chernow wrong?--[[User:Idols of Mud|Idols of Mud]] ([[User talk:Idols of Mud|talk]]) 20:40, 15 May 2008 (UTC)
:Hard to say, the source on the image is a 1901 book on the Black Hawk War. I haven't seen any other images of either Hamilton so I wouldn't be a good judge, perhaps some comparison links might help, if there are any images online. [[User:IvoShandor|IvoShandor]] ([[User talk:IvoShandor|talk]]) 21:03, 15 May 2008 (UTC)
::Hmm.  The Google search I just did is inconclusive:  That image appears for both Philip and William Hamilton (though Wikipedia is obviously leaning on that).  The Chernow book cites the image from a book from 1911 on Alexander Hamilton.  I haven't seen anything citing the original source of the drawing, or where it may be found today, if it still exists.--[[User:Idols of Mud|Idols of Mud]] ([[User talk:Idols of Mud|talk]]) 19:29, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
:::I'll keep looking around, should we remove the image? Its on Commons, so the name would have to be changed there if we discover anything. [[User:IvoShandor|IvoShandor]] ([[User talk:IvoShandor|talk]]) 19:44, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
::::Northern Illinois University sources the image to: Stevens, Frank E. The Black Hawk War. Chicago: Frank E. Stevens, 1903 (which is what I have in the image description. Their page can be [http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/fimage/blackhawk/bhw2.php?id=661 seen here]. They have the text of that book [http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/navigate.pl?lincoln.3621 here], if the link works. It has a section for portraits and illustrations which states next to the link for the Hamilton portrait: &quot;From the original, owned by the Wisconsin Historical Society, at Madison&quot;. [http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=3458&amp;qstring=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ewisconsinhistory%2Eorg%2Fwhi%2Fresults%2Easp%3Fsearch%5Ftype%3Dbasic%26keyword1%3DWilliam%2BS%2E%2BHamilton%26Submit%3DSearch Here] is what the Wisconsin Historical Society has to say about it. Based on that, Chernow might be mistaken. What do you think? [[User:IvoShandor|IvoShandor]] ([[User talk:IvoShandor|talk]]) 19:50, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
:::::Based on everything you've found, it would appear that Chernow's mistaken.  Besides your good data, it seems to me the man in the portrait is wearing a suit that would probably not have been in fashion in 1801 (when Philip was killed).  It looks more in line with clothing from the late 1810s or early 1820s, which would fit with William's age.  I think the portrait is a keeper.  Nice work.--[[User:Idols of Mud|Idols of Mud]] ([[User talk:Idols of Mud|talk]]) 15:24, 20 May 2008 (UTC)
::::::Thanks, internet sleuthing is one of my specialties. Perhaps now we should add the original, it is much better quality. [[User:IvoShandor|IvoShandor]] ([[User talk:IvoShandor|talk]]) 22:47, 20 May 2008 (UTC)
: I've come across this now from [[Philip Hamilton]], where someone posted the version from the 1911 book mentioned above. ({{Internet Archive|intimatelifeofhami00hami}}) That book (also cited by Chernow, a serious author) is written by an actual family member. I'm inclined to lean to it as a more reliable cite. (That said, it does say in the caption that it is Philip Hamilton at 20... when he died at 19.) Thoughts? —[[User:LuisVilla|Luis]] ([[User talk:LuisVilla|talk]]) 16:06, 21 April 2016 (UTC)
:: Further followup: on re-reading the introduction, the book that says this is Philip was written ''by Philip's nephew'', which I had not previously realized. Obviously he never knew his uncle (his father, the second Philip, was born after the uncle was killed) but I'm inclined to treat it as more accurate than the other book. So I think it should be removed from this article.—[[User:LuisVilla|Luis]] ([[User talk:LuisVilla|talk]]) 00:02, 23 April 2016 (UTC)</text>
