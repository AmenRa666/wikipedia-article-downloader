'''Aleksandar Ranković''' ([[nom de guerre]] '''Leka'''; {{lang-sr-Cyrl|Александар Ранковић ''Лека''}}; 28 November 1909 – 20 August 1983) was a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] communist of Serb origin, considered to be the third most powerful man in Yugoslavia after [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[Edvard Kardelj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/10891/osa:d23199e2-bcc2-4981-82fc-d4f28fa64dfd Aleksandar Rankovic - Political Profile of A Yugoslav &quot;Stalinist&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ranković was a proponent of a [[Centralization|centralized]] Yugoslavia and opposed efforts that promoted [[decentralization]] that he deemed to be against the interests of Serb unity;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melissa Katherine Bokovoy 1992. Pp. 295&quot;&gt;Melissa Katherine Bokovoy, Jill A. Irvine, Carol S. Lilly. State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992. Scranton, Pennsylvania, USA: Palgrave Macmillan, 1997, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; he ran [[Kosovo]] as a [[police state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made [[Serbs]] dominant in the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]]'s [[nomenklatura]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Melissa Katherine Bokovoy 1992. Pp. 295&quot;/&gt; Ranković supported a hardline approach against [[Albanians in Kosovo]] who were commonly suspected of pursuing seditious activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kosovo. 2000.

The popularity of Ranković's nationalistic policies in Serbia became apparent at his funeral in 1983, which large numbers of people attended. Many considered Ranković a Serbian &quot;national&quot; leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenard J. Cohen 2002. Pp. 98&quot;&gt;Lenard J. Cohen. ''Serpent in the bosom: the rise and fall of Slobodan Milošević''. Boulder, Colorado, USA: Westview Press, 2002. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Ranković's policies have been perceived as the basis of the [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] agenda of [[Slobodan Milošević]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenard J. Cohen 2002. Pp. 98&quot;/&gt;

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Ranković was born in the village of [[Draževac (Obrenovac)|Draževac]] near [[Obrenovac]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. Born into a poor family, Ranković lost his father at a young age. He attended high school in his hometown. He went to [[Belgrade]] to work and joined the workers' movement. He was also influenced by his colleagues who, at the time when the Communist Party was banned, brought communist magazines and literature with them, which were read by Ranković. At age 15 he joined the union. {{Clarify|date=December 2013}} In 1927 he met his future wife Anđa, and year later he joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]]. Soon he was named Secretary-General of the [[League of Communists of Youth of Yugoslavia]] (SKOJ) in [[Belgrade]].

==Pre-war activity==
In 1928 when he became a member of the Communist Party, Ranković was named Secretary of the Regional Committee of the SKOJ of Serbia. The [[January 6th Dictatorship]] didn't influence his political activity. As leader of the Regional Committee of SKOJ he published a flyer which was distributed in Belgrade and [[Zemun]]. During the time when flyers were being printed, one of his associates was arrested and soon Ranković was discovered by the police. He was captured in Belgrade in an illegal apartment.

Ranković's trial was one of the first trials after the declaration of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander's]] dictatorship. He was sentenced for 6 years and he spent his punishment in prisons in [[Sremska Mitrovica prison|Sremska Mitrovica]] and [[Lepoglava prison|Lepoglava]]. During his imprisonment he spread communist agenda among younger prisoners. In prison, he organized attacks on the police by political prisoners. He was released in 1935 and after the release he was enlisted to the army. After the military service he worked for the workers' movement in Belgrade. Through the unions he revived activity of the Communist Party. In 1936 he became member of the Regional Committee of Serbia and in 1937 member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. In January 1939 he started to act illegally under codename &quot;Marko&quot;. In May 1939 Ranković participated in the consultations of communists of Yugoslavia in [[Drava Banovina]] in [[Šmarna Gora (district)|Šmarna Gora]], and later he participated on the 5th Conference of KPJ held in [[Zagreb]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Later career==
Ranković was a member of the [[Politburo]] from 1940. Ranković was captured and tortured by the German [[Gestapo]] in 1941 but was later rescued in a daring raid by [[Yugoslav Partisans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rankovic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yutimes.de/aleksandar-rankovic-narodni-heroj-ili-domaci-izdajnik|title=Aleksandar Ranković. Narodni heroj ili domaci izdajnik|publisher=Yugoslavia Times|language=Serbian|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife and mother were killed by the Gestapo during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunther&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunther|first=John|authorlink=John Gunther|title=Inside Europe Today|year=1961|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Brothers]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|page=350|lccn=61-9706}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranković served on the Supreme Staff throughout the war. He was named a &quot;People's Hero&quot; for his services during World War II.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In May 1944, Ranković created [[OZNA]], the Partisan's security agency. After the war, he became minister of the interior and chief of the military intelligence agency [[UDBA]], which had replaced OZNA. 

In the daily &quot;Politika&quot; of February 1st 1951 chief of secret police Aleksandar Rankovic states: &quot;Through our jails there passed from 1941 to 1951 3.777.776 persons and we liquidated 568.000 enemies of the people&quot;.

He fell from power in 1966, ostensibly for abusing his authority by [[Covert listening device|bugging]] the sleeping quarters of President [[Josip Broz Tito]]. He was expelled from the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|SKJ]] the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;rankovic&quot;/&gt;

His fall from power marked the beginning of the end of a centralized power structure of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] over the country and the social and political separatist and autonomist movements that would culminate in the [[Croatian Spring]] and the newly de-centralized Yugoslavia that emerged from the 1971 constitutional reforms and later the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905720,00.html Yugoslavia: The Specter of Separatism]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Grob Aleksandra Rankovića.jpg|thumb|Ranković's grave in Belgrade]]

Ranković spent his remaining years in a political exile of sorts in [[Dubrovnik]] until his death in 1983. He was buried in [[Belgrade]] with some 30,000 Serbs spontaneously showing up for his funeral at Belgrade's [[Novo groblje, Belgrade|New Cemetery]], despite the event being ignored by the tightly-controlled media in the country.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
