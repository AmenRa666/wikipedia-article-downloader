'''Colonel general''' is a [[four-star rank]] in the army, equivalent to that of a full [[general]] in the US Army. [[North Korea]] and [[Russia]] are two countries that have used the rank extensively throughout their histories. The rank is also closely associated with [[Germany]], where ''[[Generaloberst]]'' has been a rank above full [[General (Germany)|''General'']] and below [[Field Marshal (Germany)|''Generalfeldmarschall'']].

==Austria==
[[File:Kuk ColGen 1918.svg|200px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[gorget patch]] ]]
Colonel general (''Generaloberst'') was the second-highest rank in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], introduced following the German model in 1915. The rank was not used after [[World War I]] in the [[Austrian Army]] of the Republic.

==China (PRC)==
The [[People's Liberation Army]] rank of ''[[Da Jiang|Da jiang]]'' (大将: literally, &quot;grand general&quot;) was a rank used from 1955 to 1965. There were four grades of general officers during this period. They were (from senior to junior), 大(grand)将(general), 上(senior)将(general)，中(middle)将(general)，少(junior)将(general). China did not and does not have brigadier general, but instead an officer of this rank is awarded 大校(grand colonel). 大将 (grand general) corresponded to the Soviet rank of colonel general. All ranks in the PLA were abolished between 1965 and 1988. When it was restored, 大将 (grand general) was not reintroduced.

== Czechoslovakia ==
[[File:CzArmy 2011 OF8-Generalporucik shoulder.svg|thumb|30px]]
The rank of colonel general (''generálplukovník'') was created in the Czechoslovak army in 1950; it was dropped after the 1993 dissolution of the state.

==Egypt==
The Egyptian Army [[Egyptian Army ranks|uses a rank]] that translates as &quot;colonel general&quot;. It is equal to the rank of 4-star or &quot;full&quot; general. Colonel general is, however, junior to the rank of field marshal and is an honorary distinction usually held only by defense ministers.

==France==
{{main|Colonel General (France)}}

In the [[French Army]], under the ''[[Ancien régime]]'', the officer in nominal command of all the regiments of a particular branch of service (i. e. infantry, cavalry, dragoons, Swiss troops, etc.) was known as the colonel general. This was not a rank, but an [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|office of the Crown]].

==Georgia==
The Republic of Georgia adopted Soviet designations after its independence in 1991 so that the rank of colonel-general ('''გენერალ-პოლკოვნიკი''' general-polkovniki) exists, yet it is only used as highest possible rank in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

==Germany==
The equivalent [[Germany|German]] four-star ranks ([[OF-9]]) of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' were as follows:
* ''[[Generaloberst]]''
* ''[[Generaladmiral]]''

Not to be confused with ''Generaloberst'', the [[three-star rank]] ([[OF-8]]) of the National People´s Army until 1990. However, the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (first in [[West Germany]] and since 1990 in a unified Germany) does not use the rank.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Hungary==
In [[Hungary]], the rank of colonel general (''vezérezredes'') was introduced to the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Imperial and Royal Army]] (the common ground force of the Dual Monarchy) in 1915. The rank replaced the ranks of ''gyalogsági tábornok'' (general of infantry), ''lovassági tábornok'' (general of cavalry), and ''táborszernagy'' (general of artillery) in the early 1940s.

The rank title ''vezérezredes'' is still in use for the highest ranking (four-star) general officer of the ''Magyar Honvédség'' and foreign four-star general officers' rank titles are usually translated as ''vezérezredes'' in Hungarian.

==North Korea==
[[File:Colonel_General_rank_insignia_(North_Korea).svg|thumb|[[NKPA]] Colonel General rank insignia]]
The [[Comparative military ranks of Korea|North Korean rank]] of ''sangjang'' translates as &quot;colonel general&quot;. ''Sangjang'' is senior to that of ''[[jungjang]]'' (usually translated as &quot;lieutenant general&quot;) and junior to that of ''[[daejang]]'' (usually translated as &quot;general&quot;).

This rank is typically held by the commanding officer of units along the [[Korean DMZ]] and the North Korean security zone at [[Panmunjon]]. It is also the rank held by the KPA Pyongyang Defense Command's commanding general.

The rank of colonel general (Russian: ''генерал-полковник, general-[[polkovnik]]'') did not exist in [[Imperial Russia]]{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} and was first established in the [[Red Army]] on 7 May 1940, as a replacement for previously existing ''командарм второго ранга'' (''[[Comandarm|kommandarm vtorovo ranga]]'', &quot;army commander of the second rank&quot;).&lt;ref name=sov&gt;{{cite book|title=Organization and Order of Battle of Militaries in World War II : Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|year=2009|publisher=Trafford On Demand Pub|page=905|isbn=1-4269-2251-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr4Xr1EeezQC&amp;lpg=PA619&amp;dq=IVth%20mechanized%20corps&amp;pg=PA905#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Charles D. Pettibone}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], about 199 officers were promoted to colonel general. Before 1943, Soviet colonel generals wore four stars on their collar patches (''petlitsy''). Since 1943, they have worn three stars on their shoulder straps, so Charles Pettibone compares the rank to the US [[lieutenant general]].&lt;ref name=sov/&gt;

The rank still exists in the contemporary [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian Army]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Unlike the German ''Generaloberst'' (which it most probably [[calque]]d), the Soviet and Russian colonel general rank is neither an exceptional nor a rare one, as it is a normal step in the &quot;ladder&quot; between a two-star [[lieutenant general]] and a four-star [[General of the Army (Russia)|army general]].

Other than that, the Soviet and Russian rank systems sometimes cause confusion in regard to equivalence of ranks, because the normal Western title for [[brigadier]] or [[brigadier general]] ceased to exist for the Russian Army in 1798. The [[combrig]] rank that corresponded to one-star general only existed in the Soviet Union during 1935–1940. Positions typically reserved for these ranks, such as [[brigade]] commanders, have always been occupied by [[colonel]]s (''[[polkovnik]]'') or, very rarely, [[major general]]s (see [[History of Russian military ranks]]).

The rank has usually been given to district, front and army commanders, and also to deputy ministers of defense, deputy heads of the general staff and so on.

In some post-Soviet [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] armies (for example in [[Belarus]]), there are no generals of the army or [[marshal]]s, and so colonel general is the highest rank, usually held by the minister of the defense.

The corresponding naval rank is [[admiral]], which is also [[three star rank|denoted by three stars]].

==Sweden==
Colonel general (''generalöverste'') has also been a senior military rank in Sweden, used principally before the 19th century.

==Syria==

The [[Syrian Arab Army]] uses the rank of colonel general ( &quot;''Imad-awwal''عماد أول) only for the senior-most rank of the army beneath that of field marshal. Usually, only defence ministers have held this rank &amp;ndash; only six officers have held this rank till now &amp;ndash; [[Hafez al-Assad]], [[Mustafa Tlass]], [[Hikmat al-Shihabi]], [[Ali Habib Mahmud]], [[Dawoud Rajiha]] and [[Fahd Jassem al-Freij]].

==United Kingdom==
The title of colonel general was used before and during the [[English Civil War]] in both [[Cavalier|Royalist]] and [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarian]] armies. In these cases, it often appears to have meant a senior [[colonel]] as opposed to a senior general.

== United States ==
In the United States, as [[commander]] of an [[army]], the equivalent rank was [[General (United States)|general]] (four-star general, grade O-10).

==Vietnam==
In Vietnam, the rank of colonel general is known as ''thượng tướng'' (literally &quot;upper general&quot;), equivalent to a three-star general and admiral. ''Thượng tướng'' is senior to ''trung tướng'' (usually translated as &quot;lieutenant general&quot;) and junior to ''đại tướng'' (usually translated as &quot;general&quot;). It is used in the army and the air force. It is the equivalent to ''đô đốc'' ([[admiral]]) in the Navy.
