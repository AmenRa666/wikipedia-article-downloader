'''Fremantle Prison''', sometimes referred to as '''Fremantle Gaol''' or '''Fremantle Jail''', is a former [[List of Australian prisons|Australian prison]] in [[Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]]. The {{convert|6|ha|adj=on|spell=in}} site includes the prison cellblocks, gatehouse, perimeter walls, cottages, and tunnels. Initially known as the '''Convict Establishment''' or '''The Establishment''', it was constructed as a prison for convicts, using [[convict labour]], between 1851 and 1859. The prison was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. [[Royal Commission]]s were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in [[Fremantle Prison riot|a 1988 riot]] with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security [[Casuarina Prison]].

The prison was administered by a [[Comptroller General of Convicts (Western Australia)|comptroller general]], sheriff, or director, responsible for the entire convict or prison system in Western Australia, and a superintendent in charge of the prison itself. Prison officers, known as warders in the 19th century, worked under stringent conditions until they achieved representation through the [[Western Australian Prison Officers' Union]]. Convicts were initially of good character as potential future colonists, but less desirable convicts were eventually sent. As a locally-run prison, Fremantle's population was generally short-sentenced white prisoners in the 1890s, with very few Aboriginal prisoners. By the late 20th century, most prisoners were serving longer sentences, a higher proportion of them were violent, and Aboriginal people were over-represented.

Prison life at Fremantle was highly regulated. Meals were an important part of the day, eaten in the cells throughout the operational life of the prison. Convict or prisoner labour was used on public infrastructure works until around 1911; subsequently, only work inside the prison was allowed, though there was never enough to fully occupy the inmates. Punishments varied over the years, with [[flogging]] and time in [[leg irons|irons]] eventually replaced by lengthening of sentences and deprivation of visitors or entertainment. More than 40 hangings were carried out at Fremantle Prison, which was Western Australia's only lawful place of execution, between 1888 and 1984. Prominent escapees included [[Moondyne Joe]], as well as [[John Boyle O'Reilly]] and six other [[Fenian]]s in the 19th century, and [[Brenden Abbott]] in 1989. There have been various riots and other disturbances, with major riots causing damage in 1968 and 1988.

Since 1991, Fremantle Prison has been conserved as a recognised heritage site, and various restoration works have been undertaken. New uses have been found for some buildings within the prison, which has also become a significant tourist attraction. The process of obtaining World Heritage listing as part of the [[Australian Convict Sites]] submission focused historical interpretation and conservation efforts on the prison's convict era (1850{{Spaced en dash}}1886), at the expense of its more recent history, including Aboriginal prisoners held there.

Fremantle Prison was built on a land grant of about {{convert|36|acres}} from limestone quarried on-site. A {{convert|15|ft|adj = on}} tall boundary wall encloses the prison grounds, with a gatehouse in the centre of the western wall, facing The Terrace.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP buildings&quot; /&gt; Other roads bounding the site are Knutsford Street to the north, [[Hampton Road]] to the east, and Fothergill Street to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palassis 2003 Master Plan Background&quot; /&gt;{{rp|7}} Cottages, which housed prison workers and officials, are located outside the wall either side of the gatehouse. Inside the walls, the parade ground is located east of the gatehouse. Beyond it is the Main Cell Block&lt;ref name=&quot;FP before-after&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=Before and After Images |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/beforeandafterimages/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513061229/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/beforeandafterimages/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 May 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXCFdZxZ |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the centre of the site,&lt;ref name=&quot;FP buildings&quot; /&gt; which contains two chapels.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP chapels&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=Chapels |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Functions/venuehire/chapels/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204233513/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Functions/venuehire/chapels/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=4 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXCzY4z7 |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; North of the main block is New Division, and west of that, in the north-western corner, is the former Women's Prison,&lt;ref name=&quot;FP buildings&quot; /&gt; previously the cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP womens&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=Women's Prison |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/womensprison/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171903/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/womensprison/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXD4qJHr |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital building stands in the north-eastern corner, while the former workshops are located in the south-eastern corner, as well as to the north of the gatehouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP buildings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=Prison Buildings |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513080020/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 May 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXCfH1jD |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system of underground tunnels, constructed to provide fresh water from an [[aquifer]], runs under the eastern edge of the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maritime Museum 2004 tunnels report&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

=== Buildings ===

==== Houses on The Terrace ====
North of the gatehouse, located at 2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, are cottages built in [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style, in contrast to the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style of the other houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=2, 4 and 6 The Terrace |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/24and6theterrace/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171647/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/24and6theterrace/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXDTRrBQ |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Number 10 is a double-storey house, initially built in 1853 for the chaplain, but taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and later used by the prison administration. An adjoining single-storey at number 12, finished in 1854, was the home of the gatekeeper, located on the north side of the gatehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=10 and 12 The Terrace |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/10and12theterrace/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171726/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/10and12theterrace/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXDa47go |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Number 16 The Terrace, south of the gatehouse, is a double-storey house that accommodated first the superintendent, and later the resident magistrate. It remained in use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=16 The Terrace |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/16theterrace/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171750/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/16theterrace/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXDh7JX1 |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Number 18, the southernmost house on The Terrace, and number 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, [[water closet]] and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=18 The Terrace |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/18theterrace/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171806/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/18theterrace/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXDml2zD |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gatehouse ====
The gatehouse and associated entry complex was constructed between 1854 and 1855 using convict labour. It was designed by Royal Engineer and Comptroller General [[Edmund Henderson]], and constructed out of limestone.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP Gatehouse&quot; /&gt; The gatehouse has two towers either side of a narrow gate, reminiscent of those found in 13th century English castles or walled cities.&lt;ref name=ausmed&gt;{{cite web |title=Fremantle Prison Gatehouse, Fremantle, Western Australia |url=http://ausmed.arts.uwa.edu.au/items/show/159 |website=Medievalism in Australian Cultural Memory |publisher=University of Western Australia |accessdate=23 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412233745/http://ausmed.arts.uwa.edu.au/items/show/159|archivedate=12 April 2011 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TWuH3R9g |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron that had been scavenged from shipwrecks was used to make the gate, while the clock at the top of the structure was imported from England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ayris |first1=Cyril |author-link1=Cyril Ayris |title=Fremantle Prison: A Brief History |year=2003 |origyear=First published 1995 |publisher=Cyril Ayris Freelance |isbn=0-9581882-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} As the main entrance, the gatehouse has remained a significant feature and landmark; since the closure of the prison, it has housed a café and office areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP Gatehouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=Gatehouse |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/Gatehouse/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171923/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/Gatehouse/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXDymX9Y |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration was carried out in 2005, preserving the original stone facade and removing non-original rendering.&lt;ref name=&quot;ausmed&quot; /&gt;

==== Main Cell Block ====
[[File:FremantlePrisonCell.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A re-creation of typical 1855 cell accommodation]]
Little-changed since its construction in the 1850s by convicts, the Main Cell Block was designed to hold up to 1000 prisoners. The central, four-storey high cell block is flanked on either end by large dormitory wards, called the Association Rooms. Here, as many as 80 men slept in hammocks, either as a reward for good behaviour or because they would soon receive their [[ticket of leave]]. In contrast, the cramped cells measured just {{convert|7|by|4|ft|spell = in}}. Although each cell initially had a basin connected to running water, the installation was before the advent of [[S-bend]]s; the smells coming up the pipes led to their removal by the 1860s. Following a [[Royal Commission]], the cells were enlarged by removing a dividing wall from between two cells. Electric lighting was installed in the 1920s, but there were never any toilets – buckets were used for the duration of the prison's operation. Since the prison's closure, six cells have been restored to represent the varying living conditions at different times in the prison's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP Main Block&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1 = The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works|title = Main Cell Block|url = http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/MainCellBlock/Pages/default.aspx|website = Fremantle Prison|publisher = Government of Western Australia|accessdate = 10 August 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171939/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/MainCellBlock/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate = 13 February 2014|deadurl = no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6TXE7UVTi|archivedate = 23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main block also houses the [[gallows]], [[solitary confinement]] cells, and two chapels – [[Anglican]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FP chapels&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|46}}

==== New Division ====
Fremantle Prison's New Division building was constructed between 1904 and 1907, as a response to overcrowding. It also allowed prison administrators to implement the &quot;[[separate system]]&quot;, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for the first three months of their sentence. A [[panopticon]] in the exercise yard was initially used to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading to its removal within five years. New Division was the first building to have electricity, with underground wiring. During World War II, the Australian Army appropriated the division, to keep their prisoners separate from the main population. In 1994 the building was retrofitted to cater for offices, small business premises, and meeting rooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP New Division&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=New Division |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/newdivision/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171842/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/newdivision/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXETG4j8 |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women's Prison ====
The north-western complex was originally a service area with a cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry, built in the 1850s. A place for women prisoners was needed following the closure of [[Perth Gaol]] and the transfer of prisoners to Fremantle. The buildings were converted to a prison, and a wall built around them, creating Western Australia's first separate prison for women. Population and crime growth led to them being extended in the 1890s and 1910s. The construction of [[Bandyup Women's Prison]] saw Fremantle's Women's Prison close in 1970, with the space used for education and assessment until the main prison's closure in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP womens&quot; /&gt;

==== Hospital ====
Built between 1857 and 1859, the hospital was a crucial component of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=Hospital |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/hospital/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171822/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/hospital/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXFK5sxZ |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Workshops ====
The original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, one of the first buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=East Workshops |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/eastworkshops/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171956/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/eastworkshops/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXFKf2gI |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Workshops were built at the start of the twentieth century, providing more work for prisoners through a paint shop, mat maker, shoe maker, book binder and tailor shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=West Workshops |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/westworkshops/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213172013/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/westworkshops/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXFMvbn2 |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1993 the four northern workshops were adapted for use as [[technical and further education|TAFE]] art workshops.&lt;ref name=AHDB /&gt;

=== Tunnels ===

The arrival of the first convict ship ''[[Scindian]]'' on 2 June 1850 was unexpected, as a sailing ship that had been sent ahead had been blown off-course. The colony's [[Round House]] jail was full, so the 75 convicts had to be left on the ship&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|18–20}} until a temporary prison was built. Comptroller General of Convicts Edward Henderson looked for a place to build a permanent convict establishment, and ultimately settled on the current site, on a hill overlooking Fremantle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|21–22}}

During [[Convict era of Western Australia|Western Australia's convict era]], the prison was known as the Convict Establishment, and was used for prisoners transported from Britain.

Once the prison came under the control of the colonial government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt; All prisoners in Perth Gaol were transferred to Fremantle, and from 1887 female prisoners were also imprisoned there, in their own separate section.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|45–46}} The [[Western Australian gold rushes]] of the 1890s resulted in strong economic growth, and a massive increase in population: doubling from almost 50,000 in 1891 to more than 100,000 by 1895, and to 184,000 by 1901.&lt;ref name=CCWA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalcentre.wa.gov.au/ResearchAndSeminarPapers/LaunchingTheShip/Pages/TheGoldrush.aspx |title=The Goldrush |work=Launching the Ship of State: A Constitutional History of Western Australia |first=Mathew |last=Trinca |year=1997 |publisher=Centre for Western Australian History, University of Western Australia |via=The Constitutional Centre of Western Australia |accessdate=9 September 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909031011/http://www.constitutionalcentre.wa.gov.au/ResearchAndSeminarPapers/LaunchingTheShip/Pages/TheGoldrush.aspx |archivedate=9 September 2004 |deadurl=no}} {{cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/12506/20120821-1029/www.ccentre.wa.gov.au/researchandseminarpapers/launchingtheship/pages/thegoldrush.aspx |archivedate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This influx included desperate, dishonest people, from elsewhere in Australia and overseas, and Fremantle Prison was soon overcrowded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|46}}

New regulations for prison officers were published in the Government Gazette in 1902, and a new Prisons Act was passed in 1903. While in theory the passing of the Act should have resulted in significant prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot;&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=Ph.D |last1=Megahey |first1=Norman |publisher=Murdoch University |title=A Community Apart: A History of Fremantle Prison, 1898–1991 |year=2000 | url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/4082/2/02Whole.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=23 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415210953/http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/4082/2/02Whole.pdf |archivedate=15 April 2011 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXGvSc2i |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48–51}}

In 1911 another Royal Commission investigation into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was ignored by the state government, which was more concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools than the plight of its prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis&quot; /&gt;{{rp|4}} However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with the appointment of a superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and the election of a [[Scaddan Ministry|Labor government]] with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912.&lt;ref name=AHDB /&gt;

=== Officers ===
On convict ships, the convicts were guarded by [[Pensioner Guards|pensioner guards]], who were soldiers awarded pensions for their service in areas such as China, Crimea, and Afghanistan. Some remained in the military, but many opted to stay in the colony as settlers, having brought their wives and children with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=State Library of Western Australia|title=Pensioner Guards|url=http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/dead_reckoning/government_archival_records/n-s/pensioner_guards|website=Dead Reckoning|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=21 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221175823/http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/dead_reckoning/government_archival_records/n-s/pensioner_guards|archivedate=21 February 2014 |deadurl=no|date=15 September 2011}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6UF21fFcf |archivedate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pensioner guards were expected to help deal with any incidents of unrest at the prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders 1960 Prison system&quot; /&gt;{{rp|12}}

Fremantle Prison's officers were known as warders until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|169}} They lived in specially built [[terrace houses]] within walking distance of the prison, and their lives were just as regimented as the prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth 2004 Convict Fremantle&quot; /&gt;{{rp|17–24}} In the 1890s warders still had stringent living and working conditions, including ten- to twelve-hour working days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevenson 1983 In the 1890s&quot; /&gt;{{rp|65–67}} Due to a high turnover rate, many had little knowledge of either official policies or unofficial rules and traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt; The warder's role, previously unwritten, only became clearly defined in 1902.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|172–173}} As well as guarding against escapes and enforcing discipline, they oversaw prisoner work and instructed inmates in trades. The warders were also supposed to be moral role models for prisoners, while maintaining a formal, distant, relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|182}}

The prison officer's role in the 20th century did not change much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|189}} Officer training became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were set up for staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|58, 61}} The most significant change in this period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the [[Western Australian Prison Officers' Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|189}} The strength of the union was based on the ability to almost cripple the prison system through [[strike action]], first taken in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|190–191}}

[[File:Fremantle Prison inmates and main front Iwel jpeg convert.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Prisoners in front of Main Cell Block, {{circa|1971}}]]
Convicts were introduced into Western Australia for three main purposes: inexpensive labour, additional labour, and an injection of British government spending into the local economy. During the initial years of transportation, convicts were generally young, from a rural background, and of good character, having only committed minor offences&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbs 2001 Archaeology&quot; /&gt;{{rp|60–61}} – potential future colonists, after their sentence had been served.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth 2004 Convict Fremantle&quot; /&gt;{{rp|74}} By the 1860s the majority were older, more serious offenders from urban areas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbs 2001 Archaeology&quot; /&gt;{{rp|61}} including [[political prisoner]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;FP Fenians&quot; /&gt; considered to be &quot;difficult and dangerous&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth 2004 Convict Fremantle&quot; /&gt;{{rp|76}} Following the transfer of Fremantle Prison to local control in 1886, it became Western Australia's primary prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|71}} In the late 1880s and 1890s the number of inmates swelled dramatically. This increase predominantly comprised prisoners serving shorter sentences of under three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|71}} The number of inmates in 1897 was 379, and Inspector of Prisons James Roe viewed the prison as &quot;inconveniently full&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|86}}

Despite a large expansion of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative to the rest of Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|86, 99}} The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population.{{refn|Of the total prison population, the proportion of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] prisoners was 5.4% in 1910, 16% in 1968, more than 30% in 1977, and at least 45% in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|89}}|group = lower-alpha}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|88–89}} Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|94}} In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, but still a minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|95–97}}

== Prison operation ==
[[File:Freo prison WMAU gnangarra-146.jpg|thumb|Daily routine in 1991]]

=== Routine ===
In the Convict Establishment of 1855, the day began with the wakeup bell at 4:30 am, and the officers and prisoners assembled in the parade ground at 5:25 am. Prisoners were sent to work before and after breakfast (in their cells), before assembling for muster at midday. This was followed by dinner in the exercise yard or the work site, and more work throughout the afternoon, until supper at 6:00 pm in the cells. Night officers took over at 7:15 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=Convict Daily Life |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/schoolgroups/educationalresources/Documents/FP%20Convict%20Daily%20Life.pdf |format=PDF |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=15 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205213722/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/schoolgroups/educationalresources/Documents/FP%20Convict%20Daily%20Life.pdf |archivedate=5 February 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXKQYqbz |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The transfer of the Convict Establishment to the colonially-run Fremantle Prison saw little change, and no new regulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevenson 1983 In the 1890s&quot; /&gt;{{rp|29}}

A similar routine, but with fewer working hours, is described in the 1930s:
{{quote|&lt;nowiki /&gt;
The following routine is observed by
those who go to Fremantle Jail:— 6.15

Not much had changed by the 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45&amp;nbsp;am. After a prisoner count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast and headed back to their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20&amp;nbsp;pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis&quot; /&gt;{{rp|14–15}}

=== Diet ===
Prisoners ate meals in their cells, from the early years of the prison&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth 2004 Convict Fremantle&quot; /&gt;{{rp|49}} through to its closure in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|7}} Bread from the prison bakehouse was included in every meal in the convict era. It was served with black tea for breakfast, and with either tea or cocoa in the evening. The main meal, called dinner, was in the middle of the day, and also featured soup, meat, and vegetables.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth 2004 Convict Fremantle&quot; /&gt;{{rp|59–60}}
By the 1890s food was still very limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, and the general standard of the prison's food was quite low,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevenson 1983 In the 1890s&quot; /&gt;{{rp|84}} particularly in 1897 and 1898. However, the quality soon improved, as noted by the 1898 Royal Commission,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevenson 1983 In the 1890s&quot; /&gt;{{rp|92}} which recommended decreasing rations to reduce costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis&quot; /&gt;{{rp|4}}

In the 1960s, food preparation was overseen by a qualified chef, who also trained prisoners. The diet consisted of quality food, but &quot;without trimmings&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis&quot; /&gt;{{rp|7}} Breakfast was porridge, with a third of a pint of milk, a hot drink (tea, unless the prisoner bought{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Prisoners were paid for the work they did, and allowed to spend a small amount each year. The pay rate ranged from 50 cents to $1.60 per week in 1968,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis&quot; /&gt;{{rp|15}} while the average weekly earnings in Western Australia for 1967–68 was $62.50&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Archer |first1=K. E. |title=Average Weekly Earnings, September Quarter 1968 |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/CAB953CDA4F5F674CA25751600114E89/$File/63020_SEP1968.pdf |publisher=Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6UGvKP87S|archivedate=22 November 2014 |deadurl=no |format=PDF |date=25 November 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} coffee or cocoa), and either [[Vegemite]], honey, or margarine, depending on the week. Lunch and dinner had more variation. Both meals consisted of a meat dish – corned beef, sausages, or mince pie – as well as mashed potato and cabbage, although there was occasionally a [[roast dinner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis&quot; /&gt;{{rp|7–8}} Meat, vegetables and bread were still a prominent part of the diet in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|7}}

=== Labour ===
As well as being used to build the prison itself, convict labour, with convicts in [[chain gang]]s, was used for other public works in the Fremantle and surrounding Perth area, including [[The Causeway]], [[Perth Town Hall]] and [[Stirling Highway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|33–34}}
The work undertaken by a convict depended on their behaviour and demeanour. Upon arrival to Western Australia, convicts were kept within the prison for a period of observation. If found to have a reasonable disposition, the convict would be sent to work, in a gang under the control of a warder. Typical activities included &quot;quarrying, filling swamps, burning lime, constructing public buildings, roads and jetties&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbs 2001 Archaeology&quot; /&gt;{{rp|61}} around Fremantle and Perth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbs 2001 Archaeology&quot; /&gt;{{rp|61}}

After some time, they might be sent to work on road or other projects away from these main settlements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbs 2001 Archaeology&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbs |first1=Martin |title=The Archaeology of the Convict System in Western Australia |journal=Australasian Historical Archaeology |date=2001 |volume=19 |pages=60–72 |url=http://0-search.informit.com.au.catalogue.slwa.wa.gov.au/documentSummary;dn=200204953;res=IELAPA |via=[[State Library of Western Australia]] access to [[RMIT Informit|Informit]] |registration=yes |issn=1322-9214}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted at the end of a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after [[corporal punishment]] and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbs 2001 Archaeology&quot; /&gt;{{rp|61}}

Outside work, mostly on public infrastructure, continued beyond the convict era, but gradually declined due to discipline concerns, the rise of trade unions that saw such work as &quot;a threat to free labour&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|151}} and an increasing emphasis on work as rehabilitation rather than punishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|151–152}} By 1911 outside work had all but ceased,&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|156}} but could not adequately be replaced by employment within the prison walls; a lack of suitable work plagued the prison throughout its lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|149}} Work in the 19th century consisted of cooking, washing clothes, cleaning the prison, tailoring, bootmaking, and printing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth 2004 Convict Fremantle&quot; /&gt;{{rp|49}} However, demand exceeded the availability of such work – increasingly so in the later years of the 19th century – so prisoners were also given activities with no practical value other than keeping them occupied. These included breaking stones, operating a water pump, and [[oakum]] picking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgiou 1995 Work and reform&quot; /&gt;{{rp|8}} Even with these extra activities, by 1899, 60 to 70 men&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|156}} were employed at the pump, each doing only a few minutes work per hour, and occupied the rest of the time with recreation such as [[draughts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders 1960 Prison system&quot; /&gt;{{rp|17}}

New workshops built in 1901 allowed prisoners to work in bootmaking and tailoring, and from 1904, printing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|145–146}} Only a small fraction of prisoners were allocated to the workshops – 35 out of an average of 279 prisoners in 1902.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|151}} In 1908, there were still few men employed in the workshops, 20 in tailoring, 15 in bootmaking, and 12 in mat making, with only half of these working at a time, and little improvement by the 1911 Royal Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|155–156}} The 20th century saw little change in the work prisoners did. There were similar workshops, with the addition of metal work, and similar jobs around the prison complex, including in the laundry, in the kitchen, and cleaning the prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|160–161}} In 1984, 90% of prisoners were reported to be employed, either full-time or part-time. The meaningfulness of the work was nominal, as work was viewed as &quot;a management option rather than [for] production&quot;,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|According to the superintendent in 1983&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|161}}}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|161}} but security concerns and discipline restricted the rehabilitative value of the work,&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|164}} and limited much of the work to jobs non-existent outside of prison.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Examples included &quot;making paper bags, tailoring and heaping wood&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|161}}}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Megahey 2000 Community apart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|161}}

=== Punishments ===
[[File:FremantletPrisonWhippingPost 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Post prisoners were tied to when flogged]]
In the convict era, particularly during Hampton's term as governor, misbehaving prisoners were punished with [[flogging]], solitary confinement, and working in chain gangs at gunpoint.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders 1960 Prison system&quot; /&gt;{{rp|12}} Particularly difficult prisoners were put to work hand pumping groundwater into the prison's reservoir. Known as cranking, it was especially despised by the prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|31}} Staff disliked giving the lashings – in 1851, out of a total of 400 lashings ordered, 150 were remitted as the superintendent could not find anyone to undertake the task. The role was so disliked that inducements were offered, including extra pay or improved lodgings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth 2004 Convict Fremantle&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bosworth |first1=Michal |title=Convict Fremantle: A Place of Promise and Punishment |year=2004 |publisher=University of Western Australia Press |isbn=978-1-920694-33-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}

By the 1880s, punishments also included a restricted diet of bread and water (for a short time span), time in [[leg irons|irons]], and a lengthening of a prisoner's sentence by a visiting magistrate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders 1960 Prison system&quot; /&gt;{{rp|16,18}} The [[cat o' nine tails]], which had been used since the early days of the prison,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|31}} was abolished during the post-1911 Royal Commission reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders 1960 Prison system&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}} Other reforms in this period saw the number of punishments inflicted decrease from 184 in 1913 to 57 in 1914, and 35 in 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders 1960 Prison system&quot; /&gt;{{rp|25}}

Flogging was discontinued in the 1940s, with the last incident occurring in 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth 2004 Convict Fremantle&quot; /&gt;{{rp|52}} From that decade, punishments were decided by the superintendent after hearing the case against a prisoner, or by a magistrate for grievous violations. Lesser transgressions could result in solitary confinement, or restriction from visitors, education, and concerts; serious offences were punishable by the cancellation of any remission earned and a bread-and-water diet, normally over a two-week period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders 1960 Prison system&quot; /&gt;{{rp|30}}

The last person to be hanged was serial killer [[Eric Edgar Cooke]], executed in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|63}}

From the day of sentencing to death, prisoners were kept in a concrete-floored cell in New Division. They were vigilantly observed to prevent them escaping their sentence through suicide. With hangings taking place on Monday mornings, at 8:00&amp;nbsp;am, condemned prisoners were woken three hours earlier, and provided with a last meal, shower, and clean clothes. Afterwards, handcuffed, they were moved to a holding or &quot;condemned cell&quot; nearby the gallows, and allowed a couple of sips of brandy to calm their nerves. Shortly before 8:00&amp;nbsp;am, they were hooded, led up to the execution chamber, which could hold as many as eleven witnesses, stood over the trap door, had a noose put around their neck, and were hanged by dropping through the opening trap door. After medical examination, the deceased was removed for burial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|54–56}}

=== Escapes ===
There were a multitude of attempted escapes from Fremantle Prison. Prominent escapees included [[Moondyne Joe]] in 1867, [[John Boyle O'Reilly]] in 1869 and six other [[Fenian]]s in 1876, and [[Brenden Abbott]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=HEWA&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murray |first1=Sandra |editor1-last=Gregory |editor1-first=Jenny |editor2-last=Gothard |editor2-first=Jan |title=Fremantle Prison |work=Historical Encyclopedia of Western Australia |date=2009 |publisher=University of Western Australia Press |isbn=978-1-921401-15-2 |pages=391–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Bolitho Johns, better known as Moondyne Joe, was Western Australia's best known [[bushranger]]. In July 1865, Johns was sentenced to ten years penal servitude for killing a steer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3753477 |title=Supreme Court—Criminal Side |newspaper=[[The Perth Gazette and West Australian Times]] |date=7 July 1865 |accessdate=3 June 2014 |page=3 |via=Trove (National Library of Australia)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot 1978 Moondyne Joe&quot; /&gt;{{rp|41–43}}  He and another prisoner absconded from a work party in early November, and were on the run for nearly a month, during which time Johns adopted the nickname Moondyne Joe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot 1978 Moondyne Joe&quot; /&gt;{{rp|44–45, 47}} For absconding and for being in possession of a firearm, Moondyne Joe was sentenced to twelve months in irons, and transferred to Fremantle Prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot 1978 Moondyne Joe&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elliot |first1=Ian |title=Moondyne Joe: The Man and the Myth |origyear=First published: Nedlands, Western Australia: University of Western Australia Press, 1978 ISBN 0-85564-130-4 |year=1998 |location=Carlisle, Western Australia |publisher=Hesperian Press |isbn=0-85905-244-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49–50}} In July 1866 he received a further six months in irons for trying to cut the lock out of his door, but in August Moondyne Joe succeeded in escaping again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot 1978 Moondyne Joe&quot; /&gt;{{rp|54–56}} Moondyne Joe formulated a plan to escape the colony by travelling overland to South Australia, but was captured on 29 September about {{convert|300|km|mi}} north-east of [[Perth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot 1978 Moondyne Joe&quot; /&gt;{{rp|59, 66–67, 81}}

As punishment for escaping and for the robberies committed while on the run, Moondyne Joe received five years hard labour on top of his remaining sentence.  Extraordinary measures were taken to ensure that he did not escape again. He was transferred to Fremantle Prison where a special &quot;escape-proof&quot; cell was made for him, built from stone, lined with [[Eucalyptus marginata|jarrah]] [[Railroad tie|sleepers]] and over 1000 nails. In early 1867 Moondyne Joe was set to work breaking stone, but rather than permit him to leave the prison,&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot 1978 Moondyne Joe&quot; /&gt; the acting comptroller-general&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayris 2003 Brief History&quot; /&gt;{{rp|37}} ordered that the stone be brought in and dumped in a corner of the prison yard, where Moondyne Joe worked under the constant supervision of a warder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot 1978 Moondyne Joe&quot; /&gt;

Governor [[John Hampton]] was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Moondyne Joe: &quot;If you get out again, I'll forgive you&quot;. However, the rock broken by Moondyne Joe was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the limestone wall of the prison. On 7 March 1867, Moondyne Joe escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot 1978 Moondyne Joe&quot; /&gt;{{rp|86–89}} A few days before the second anniversary of his escape, Moondyne Joe was recaptured, returned to prison, and sentenced to an additional four years in irons. Eventually, Governor [[Frederick Weld]] heard of his predecessor Hampton's promise, and decided that further punishment would be unfair. Moondyne Joe was given a ticket of leave in May 1871.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot 1978 Moondyne Joe&quot; /&gt;{{rp|111–113, 165–166}}{{clear left}}

==== The Fenians ====
{{Main article|Catalpa rescue}}
[[File:Fenians escape Fremantle.jpg|thumb|Fenians escape by whaleboat to ''Catalpa'']]
From 1865 to 1867, British authorities rounded up supporters of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], or Fenians, an [[Ireland|Irish]] independence movement, and transported sixty-two of them to Western Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP Fenians&quot; /&gt; In 1869, John Boyle O'Reilly escaped on the American whaling ship ''Gazelle''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title-link=s:Page:Life of John Boyle O'Reilly.djvu/118 |title=Life of John Boyle O'Reilly |others={{icon|Wikisource}} |last=Roche |first=James Jeffrey |editor-last=O'Reilly |editor-first=Mary |year=1891 |publisher=Cassell |location=New York |via=Wikisource |page=82}} {{cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/cu31924022146645 |archivedate=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in Boston. Later that year, pardons were issued to many of the imprisoned Fenians, after which only eight militant Fenians remained in Western Australia's penal system.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP Fenians&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance – Building Management and Works |title=The Fenians |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/History/theconvictera/characters/thefenians/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=11 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512214853/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/History/theconvictera/characters/thefenians/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=12 May 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXKS2BmX |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fenians in America bought the whaling ship ''Catalpa'', which on 29 April 1875 sailed from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] on a secret rescue mission. Coordinating with local Fenian agents, the escape was arranged for 17 April 1876, when most of the Convict Establishment garrison would be watching the Royal Perth Yacht Club [[regatta]]. ''Catalpa'' dropped anchor in [[international waters]] off [[Rockingham, Western Australia|Rockingham]] and dispatched a [[whaleboat]] to the shore. At 8.30 am, six Fenians who were working in work parties outside the prison walls absconded, and were met by carriages that raced {{convert|50|km}} south to where the boat was waiting.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP Fenians&quot; /&gt;

The whaleboat managed to rendezvous with ''Catalpa'' the following day, which then headed out to sea. They were chased by the steamship ''[[SS Georgette]]'', which had been commandeered by the colonial governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP Fenians&quot; /&gt; Though ''Georgette'' caught up with the whaler on 19 April, ''Catalpa''{{'s}} master claimed they were in international waters, and that an attack on ''Catalpa'' would be considered an [[Casus belli|act of war]] against the United States. Not wanting to cause a diplomatic incident, ''Georgette'' allowed ''Catalpa'' to flee.&lt;ref name=&quot;FP Fenians&quot; /&gt;

==== Brenden Abbott ====

Brenden Abbott, &quot;the Postcard Bandit&quot;, escaped from Fremantle Prison in 1989.

While working in the prison's tailor shop, he was able to stitch together overalls resembling those worn by the guards. Abbott and two accomplices took the opportunity to escape, wearing the overalls, when left unsupervised in the workshop. They cut through a bar and got onto the roof. One accomplice fell and broke his leg, but Abbott and the other managed to jump over to the wall, and thus escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Australian Story 2003 Usual Suspect&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Caroline |title=The Usual Suspect |url=http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2003/s978408.htm |work=[[Australian Story]] |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=6 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216215802/http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2003/s978408.htm |archivedate=16 December 2013 |deadurl=no |format=transcript |date=27 October 2003}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TsWPu1eN |archivedate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1968 ====
A riot occurred on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the serving of allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening. Other factors that contributed were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing to go back to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis&quot; /&gt;

After approximately three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, but took seven hours to subdue the prisoners, with the last of them locked in their cells just after midnight. The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, [[Karnet Prison Farm|Karnet]], and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the [[Brand–Nalder Ministry|state government]], which did not consider prison reform a priority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis&quot;&gt;{{cite thesis |degree = M.A.|first = Nancy P.|last = Stokes|title = Human Geography Thesis on Fremantle Prison|publisher = [[Graylands Teachers College]]|date = November 1968|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21750802?q=+&amp;versionId=26151783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Federal Heritage Minister, Senator [[Ian Campbell (Australian politician)|Ian Campbell]], stated that it would be included in a nomination of eleven convict areas to become [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2005 |title=Fremantle Prison WA's First National Heritage Listing |work=Archived Media Releases and Speeches |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/archive/env/2005/mr01aug305.html |publisher=Department of the Environment, Commonwealth of Australia |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/67588/20071024-0001/www.environment.gov.au/minister/env/2005/mr01aug305.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 October 2014}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXHZ80Wi |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, these locations were inscribed on the UNESCO [[World Heritage List]] in 2010 as the [[Australian Convict Sites]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World Heritage ABC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/01/2970125.htm |title=World Heritage Status for Fremantle Prison |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813030425/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-08-01/world-heritage-status-for-fremantle-prison/927578 |archivedate=13 August 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXHdU3ai |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of obtaining World Heritage listing focused historical interpretation and conservation efforts on the prison's convict era. This came at the expense of its more recent history, included use as an internment centre during World War II, and the imprisonment of Aboriginal prisoners. The prioritisation, evident from the first [[Conservation Plan|conservation plans]] from before the prison closed, is reflected in the branding of the tourist experience as &quot;Fremantle Prison – the Convict Establishment&quot;, and through restorations that, while necessary to prevent damage and deterioration, strip away the site's recent history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witcomb 2012 tensions world heritage&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Witcomb|first1 = Andrea|title = Tensions Between World Heritage and Local Values: The Case of Fremantle Prison (Australia)|year = 2012|work = World Heritage Papers|volume = 31|department = Community Development Through World Heritage|editor1-last = Albert|editor1-first = Marie-Theres|editor2-last = Richon|editor2-first = Marielle|editor3-last = Viñals|editor3-first = Marie José|editor4-last = Witcomb|editor4-first = Andrea|display-editors = 3|publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)&amp;nbsp;– World Heritage Centre|location = Paris, France|url = http://whc.unesco.org/document/117040|format = PDF|accessdate = 13 October 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140829222225/http://whc.unesco.org/document/117040|archivedate = 29 August 2014|deadurl = no|isbn = 978-92-3-001024-9}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6TXHtVWpx|archivedate = 23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoration ===
Various parts of Fremantle Prison have had restoration works undertaken since the 1990s; a total of $800,000 was spent between 1996/97 and 1998/99&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=Western Australia |title=Fremantle Prison, Restoration Work |url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/hansard/hans35.nsf/(ATT)/21A70E7082A59FEB482567A9001EFA9E/$file/A0701038.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=23 October 2014 |house=[[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] |date=1 July 1999 |page=9986 |speaker=[[Mike Board]] |position=Minister for Works |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023133830/http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/hansard/hans35.nsf/(ATT)/21A70E7082A59FEB482567A9001EFA9E/$file/A0701038.PDF |archivedate=23 October 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{Cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXWLxE79 |archivedate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on works which included restoring the facade of the Anglican chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fremantle Prison's Chapel Gets a Helping Hand |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/archive/env/97/mr27julwa97.html |website=Archived Media Releases and Speeches |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=23 October 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TXWPsD24 |archivedate=23 October 2014 |deadurl=no |date=27 July 1997}} {{cite additional archived pages |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/67588/20070202-0000/www.environment.gov.au/minister/env/97/mr27julwa97.html |archivedate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
