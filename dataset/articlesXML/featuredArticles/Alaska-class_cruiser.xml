The '''''Alaska'' class''' was a class of six [[Alaska-class cruiser#.22Large cruisers.22 or .22battlecruisers.22|large cruisers]] ordered before [[World War II]] for the [[United States Navy]]. They were [[United States ship naming conventions|officially classed]] as large cruisers (CB), but others have regarded them as [[battlecruiser]]s. They were all named after territories or [[insular area]]s of the United States, signifying their intermediate status between larger [[battleship]]s and smaller [[heavy cruiser|heavy]] and [[light cruiser]]s.{{efn-ua|With only one exception (USS ''Kearsarge''), US battleships, such as {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|6}} or {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|6}}, were named for states, while cruisers, like {{USS|Wichita|CA-45|6}}, were named for cities. See [[United States ship naming conventions]]. Alaska and Hawaii were insular areas of the United States at the time; they became the forty-ninth and fiftieth States in 1959.}} Of the six planned, two were completed, the third's construction was suspended on 16 April 1947, and the last three were canceled. {{USS|Alaska|CB-1|2}} and {{USS|Guam|CB-2|2}} served with the U.S. Navy for the last year of World War II as bombardment ships and fast carrier escorts. They were decommissioned in 1947 after spending only 32 and 29 months in service, respectively.

The idea for a large cruiser class originated in the early 1930s when the U.S. Navy sought to counter {{sclass-|Deutschland|cruiser|0}} &quot;pocket battleships&quot; being launched by Germany. Planning for ships that eventually evolved into the ''Alaska'' class began in the late 1930s after the deployment of Germany's {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|2}}s and rumors that Japan was constructing a new battlecruiser class.&lt;ref name=Worth305&gt;Worth, 305.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|''[[Jane's Fighting Ships|Jane's]]'' thought that this mythical battlecruiser, the notional ''Chichibu'' class, would have six 12-inch guns and {{convert|30|kn}} speed packed into a 15,000-ton ship. See Fitzsimons, Volume 1, 58 and Worth, 305.}} To serve as &quot;cruiser-killers&quot; capable of seeking out and destroying these post-[[London Naval Conference|Treaty]] heavy cruisers, the class was given large guns of a new and expensive design, limited armor protection against 12-inch shells, and machinery capable of speeds of about {{convert|31|–|33|kn}}.

== Background ==
Heavy cruiser development steadied between World War I and World War II thanks to the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and successor [[Second London Naval Treaty|treaties and conferences]], where the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy agreed to limit [[heavy cruiser]]s to 10,000&amp;nbsp;tons [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] with 8-inch main armament. Up until the ''Alaska'' class, US cruisers designed between the wars followed this pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer and Roberts, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial impetus for the ''Alaska'' design came from the deployments of Germany's so-called [[pocket battleships]] in the early 1930s. Though no actions were immediately taken, these thoughts were revived in the late 1930s when intelligence reports indicated Japan was planning or building &quot;super cruisers&quot; that would be much more powerful than the current US heavy cruisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawaii DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Global Security&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scarpaci17&gt;Scarpaci, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Japan actually developed plans for two super cruisers in 1941, though it was mostly in response to the new ''Alaska'' ships. However, the ships were not ordered due to the greater need for carriers. See [[Design B-65 cruiser]].}} The navy responded in 1938 when the [[General Board of the United States Navy|General Board]] asked the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] to conduct a &quot;comprehensive study of all types of naval vessels for consideration for a new and expanded building program&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dulin189&gt;Dulin and Garzke, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The US President at the time, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], may have taken a lead role in the development of the class with his desire to have a counter to raiding abilities of Japanese cruisers and German pocket battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Dulin and Garzke, 24 and 179.&lt;/ref&gt; While these claims are difficult to verify,&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morison85&gt;Morison and Polmar, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; they have led to the speculation that their design was &quot;politically motivated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dulin and Garzke 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===
One historian described the design process of the ''Alaska'' class as &quot;torturous&quot; due to the numerous changes and modifications made to the ship's layouts by numerous departments and individuals.&lt;ref name=Worth305/&gt; Indeed, there were at least nine different layouts,&lt;ref&gt;Dulin and Garzke, 179–183.&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from 6,000-ton {{sclass-|Atlanta|cruiser|0}} anti-aircraft cruisers&lt;ref name=Dulin179/&gt; to &quot;overgrown&quot; [[heavy cruisers]]&lt;ref name=Worth305/&gt; and a 38,000-ton mini-[[battleship]] that would have been armed with twelve 12-inch and sixteen 5-inch guns.&lt;ref name=Dulin179&gt;Dulin and Garzke, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The General Board, in an attempt to keep the displacement under 25,000&amp;nbsp;tons, allowed the designs to offer only limited underwater protection. As a result, the ''Alaska'' class, when built, were vulnerable to torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship.&lt;ref name=Dulin183&gt;Dulin and Garzke, 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The final design was a scaled-up {{sclass-|Baltimore|cruiser|4}} that had the same machinery as the {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s. This ship combined a main armament of nine 12-inch guns with protection against 10-inch gunfire into a hull that was capable of {{convert|33|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Scarpaci17/&gt;

The ''Alaska''s were officially funded in September 1940 along with a plethora of other ships as a part of the [[Two-Ocean Navy Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Global Security&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rohwer40&gt;Rohwer, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Over two hundred other ships were ordered at the same time: two {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s, five {{sclass-|Montana|battleship|2}}s, twelve {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s, four {{sclass-|Baltimore|heavy cruiser}}s, 19 {{sclass-|Cleveland|light cruiser}}s, four {{sclass-|Atlanta|light cruiser|2}}s, 52 {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer}}s, twelve {{sclass-|Benson|destroyer|2}}s and 73 {{sclass-|Gato|submarine}}s.}} Their role had been altered slightly: in addition to their surface-to-surface role, they were planned to protect carrier groups. Because of their bigger guns, greater size and increased speed, they would be more valuable in this role than heavy cruisers, and would provide insurance against reports that Japan was building super cruisers more powerful than U.S. heavy cruisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Global Security&quot;/&gt;

=== Possible conversion to aircraft carriers ===
[[Image:USS Alaska (CB-1) launching.jpg|thumb|right|upright|{{USS|Alaska|CB-1|2}} being [[Ship launching|launched]] on 15 August 1943]]
Yet another drastic change was considered during the &quot;carrier panic&quot; in late 1941, when the Navy realized that they needed more [[aircraft carrier]]s as quickly as possible. Many hulls currently under construction were considered for conversion into carriers. At different times, they considered some or all of the {{sclass-|Cleveland|cruiser|0}} [[light cruiser]]s, the {{sclass-|Baltimore|cruiser|0}} [[heavy cruiser]]s, the ''Alaska'' class, and even one of the {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|3}}s; in the end, they chose the ''Cleveland''s,&lt;ref name=Friedman190&gt;Friedman, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the conversion of nine ships under construction at the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]] shipyard as the [[light aircraft carrier]]s comprising the {{sclass-|Independence|aircraft carrier|0}}.

A conversion of the ''Alaska'' cruisers to carriers was &quot;particularly attractive&quot;&lt;ref name=Friedman190/&gt; because of the many similarities between the design of the {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier|2}}s and the ''Alaska'' class, including the same machinery.&lt;ref name = &quot;Fitzsimons 1 58&quot;&gt;Fitzsimons, Volume 1, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when ''Alaska'' cruisers were compared to the ''Essex'' carriers, converted cruisers would have had a shorter flight deck (so they could carry only 90% of the aircraft),&lt;ref name=Friedman190/&gt; would have been {{convert|11|ft|m}} lower in the water, and could travel {{convert|8000|nmi|km}} less at {{convert|15|kn}}. In addition, the large cruiser design did not include the massive underwater protections found in normal carriers due to the armor weight devoted to counter shell fire. Lastly, an ''Alaska'' conversion could not satisfy the navy's goal of having new aircraft carriers quickly, as the work needed to modify the ships into carriers would entail long delays. With this in mind, all planning to convert the ''Alaska''s was abandoned on 7 January 1942.&lt;ref name=Friedman191&gt;Friedman, 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==

Of the six ''Alaska''-class cruisers that were planned, only three were laid down. The first two, {{USS|Alaska|CB-1|2}} and {{USS|Guam|CB-2|2}}, were completed. Construction of {{USS|Hawaii|CB-3|2}}, the third, was suspended on 16 April 1947 when she was 84% complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawaii DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dulin189/&gt; The last three, ''Philippines'', ''Puerto Rico'', and ''Samoa'', were delayed since all available materials and slipways were allocated to higher priority ships, such as aircraft carriers, [[destroyer]]s, and [[submarine]]s. Construction had still not begun when steel shortages&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimons, Volume 1, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and a realization that these &quot;cruiser-killers&quot; had no more cruisers to hunt—as the fleets of Japanese cruisers had already been defeated by aircraft and submarines—made the ships &quot;[[white elephants]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's&quot;/&gt; As a result, construction of the last three members of the class never began, and they were officially canceled on 24 June 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillipines DANFS&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Philippines | url = http://hazegray.org/danfs/cruisers/cb4.htm | accessdate=15 October 2008|short=yes|link=no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081023071417/http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/cruisers/cb4.htm| archivedate= 23 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Puerto Rico DANFS&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Puerto Rico | url = http://hazegray.org/danfs/cruisers/cb5.htm | accessdate=15 October 2008|short=yes|link=no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081023071422/http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/cruisers/cb5.htm| archivedate= 23 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Samoa DANFS&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Samoa | url = http://hazegray.org/danfs/cruisers/cb6.htm | accessdate=15 October 2008|short=yes|link=no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081020163118/http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/cruisers/cb6.htm| archivedate= 20 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service history ==
[[Image:Guam shakedown.jpg|thumb|right|''Guam'' during her shakedown cruise on 13 November 1944]]

{{USS|Alaska|CB-1|2}} and {{USS|Guam|CB-2|2}} served with the U.S. Navy during the last year of World War II. Similar to the {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|0}} [[fast battleship]]s, their speed made them useful as shore bombardment ships and fast carrier escorts. Both protected {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}} when she was on her way to be repaired in Guam after being hit by two Japanese bombs. Afterward, ''Alaska'' supported the [[Battle of Okinawa|landings on Okinawa]], while ''Guam'' went to [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]] to become the leader of a new task force, Cruiser Task Force 95. ''Guam'', joined by ''Alaska'', four light cruisers, and nine destroyers, led the task force into the [[East China Sea|East China]] and [[Yellow Sea]]s to conduct raids upon shipping; however, they only encountered Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guam DANFS&quot;/&gt; By the end of the war, the two had become celebrated within the fleet as excellent carrier escorts.&lt;ref name=Miller200/&gt;  During the war, both ships were part of Cruiser Division 16 commanded by [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] Francis S.

Its mission was to support the [[US occupation of Korea|allied occupation of the Korean peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marolda |first= Edward J. |date= October 2011 |title= Asian Warm-up to the Cold War |url= http://www.usni.org/magazines/navalhistory/2011-10/asian-warm-cold-war |journal= [[United States Naval Institute#Naval History|Naval History]] |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] |volume=25 |issue=5  |pages= 27–28|doi= |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Barlow |last= Jeffrey G. |title= From Hot War to Cold: The U.S. Navy and National Security Affairs, 1945–1955 |year= 2009 |publisher= [[Stanford University Press]] |location=[[Palo Alto, California]] |isbn=978-0-8047-5666-2 |page= 129 |url= http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=9916 |accessdate=9 July 2014 |quote=Hereafter referred to as: Bartow.

In 1958, the [[Bureau of Ships]] prepared two feasibility studies to explore whether ''Alaska'' and ''Guam'' could be suitably converted into [[guided-missile cruiser]]s. The first study involved removing all of the guns in favor of four different missile systems. At $160&amp;nbsp;million, the cost of this proposed removal was seen as prohibitive, so a second study was initiated. The study left the forward batteries (the two 12-inch triple turrets and three of the 5-inch dual turrets) unchanged, and added a reduced version of the first plan on the stern of the ship. Even though the proposals would have cost approximately half as much as the first study's plan ($82&amp;nbsp;million), it was still seen as too expensive.&lt;ref name=Dulin187&gt;Dulin and Garzke 187.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, both ships were stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 1 June 1960. ''Alaska'' was sold for scrap on 30 June 1960, and ''Guam'' on 24 May 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guam DANFS&quot;/&gt;

The still-incomplete {{USS|Hawaii|CB-3|2}} was considered for a conversion to be the Navy's first guided-missile cruiser;{{efn-ua|A similar proposal was made to convert the uncompleted ''Iowa''-class battleship {{USS|Kentucky|BB-66|6}} into the first guided-missile battleship, but as with the proposal for ''Hawaii'' this conversion never materialized, and ''Kentucky'' was scrapped in 1958.}} this thought lasted until 26 February 1952, when a different conversion to a &quot;[[command ship|large command ship]]&quot; was contemplated. In anticipation of the conversion, her [[hull classification symbol|classification]] was changed to CBC-1. This would have made her a &quot;larger sister&quot; to {{USS|Northampton|CLC-1|2}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's&quot;/&gt; but a year and a half later (9 October 1954) she was re-designated CB-3. ''Hawaii'' was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 June 1958 and was sold for scrap in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawaii DANFS&quot;/&gt;

== &quot;Large cruisers&quot; or &quot;battlecruisers&quot; ==
[[Image:USS Missouri (BB-63) and USS Alaska (CB-1) at Norfolk, Virginia, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Iowa''-class battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}} (top) and {{USS|Alaska|CB-1|2}} moored at the same pier, showing their difference in size]]

Early in its development, the class used the US [[battlecruiser]] [[Hull classification symbol|designation]] CC, which had been planned for the {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|4}}. However, the designation was changed to CB to reflect their new status, &quot;large cruiser&quot;, and the practice of referring to them as battlecruisers was officially discouraged.&lt;ref name=Morison85/&gt; The U.S. Navy then named the individual vessels after U.S. territories, rather than states (as was the tradition with battleships) or cities (for which cruisers were named), to symbolize the belief that these ships were supposed to play an intermediate role between heavy cruisers and fully-fledged battleships.&lt;ref name=Worth305/&gt;

The ''Alaska'' class certainly resembled contemporary US battleships (particularly the {{sclass-|North Carolina|battleship|4}}, {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1939)|4}}, and {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|4}}) in appearance, including the familiar 2-A-1 main battery and massive columnar mast, and displaced twice that of the newest heavy cruisers (the {{sclass-|Baltimore|cruiser|4}}).&lt;ref name=Morison84&gt;Morison, Morison and Polmar, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; In weight, the ships were only 5,000&amp;nbsp;tons less than the [[Second London Naval Treaty|London Treaty]] battleship standard displacement limit of 35,000 long tons (36,000 t), also longer than several treaty battleships such as the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|4}} and ''North Carolina'' class.

In design and armor the ''Alaska'' class are regarded as &quot;large cruisers&quot; rather than battlecruisers. Their design was scaled up from the [[treaty cruiser]]s limited by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington]], [[London Naval Treaty|London]] and [[Second London Naval Treaty|Second London]] naval treaties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's&quot;/&gt; In common with U.S. heavy cruisers, they had aircraft hangars and a single large rudder. Their armor lacked the [[Torpedo belt|underwater protection systems]] found on full-fledged battleships and even intermediate capital ships like the French {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|5}} and German {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|5}} classes. This left the ''Alaska''s virtually defenseless against torpedoes, as well as vulnerable to shells falling slightly short and continuing underwater to hit the hull.&lt;ref name=Worth305/&gt; While the ''Alaska''s had more side armor than other contemporary U.S. cruisers, their protection was only marginally capable of stopping 12&quot; fire;&lt;ref name=Dulin283&gt;Dulin and Garzke, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; they were vulnerable to battleship fire (14–16&quot; fire) at any range.&lt;ref name=Dulin279&gt;Dulin and Garzke, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, despite being much larger than the ''Baltimore'' class, the numbers of secondary and anti-aircraft batteries of the ''Alaska''s were similar. Whereas the ''Alaska'' class carried twelve [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|5&quot;/38 caliber]] in six twin turrets, fifty-six 40&amp;nbsp;mm, and thirty-four 20&amp;nbsp;mm guns, the ''Baltimore'' class carried the same number of 5&quot;/38s, eight fewer 40&amp;nbsp;mm, and ten fewer 20&amp;nbsp;mm.,&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's&quot;/&gt; considerably fewer than new U.S. battleships that had ten (save for {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}}) 5&quot;/38 twin mounts while older refitted U.S. battleships had eight. Author Richard Worth remarked that when they were finally completed, launched, and commissioned, they had the &quot;size of a battleship but the capabilities of a cruiser&quot;. The ''Alaska'' class was similarly expensive to build and maintain as contemporary battleships yet far less capable due to armor deficiencies, while able to put up an anti-aircraft defense comparable only to the much cheaper ''Baltimore'' cruisers.&lt;ref name=Worth305/&gt;

Despite these cruiser-like characteristics, and the U.S. Navy's insistence on their status as cruisers, the ''Alaska'' class has been frequently described as battlecruisers.&lt;ref name=Morison84/&gt; The official navy magazine ''All Hands'' said &quot;The ''Guam'' and her sister ship ''Alaska'' are the first American battle cruisers ever to be completed as such.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''All Hands'', December 1945, &quot;Sleek, Fast, Deadly- Our New CB's&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians take the view that this is a more accurate designation because they believe that the ships were &quot;in all senses of the word, battlecruisers&quot;, with all the vulnerabilities of the type.&lt;ref name=Osbourne245&gt;Osbourne, 245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dulin279/&gt; The traditional Anglo-American battlecruiser concept had always sacrificed protection for the sake of speed and armament—they were not intended to stand up against the guns they themselves carried.&lt;ref&gt;Dulin and Garzke, p. 279; see also Jon Tetsuro Sumida, ''In Defence of Naval Supremacy'' (London: Routledge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Alaska''s{{'}} percentage of armor tonnage, 28.4%, was slightly less than that of [[fast battleship]]s; the British ''King George V'' class,  the American ''Iowa'' class, and the battlecruiser/fast battleship {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} all had armor percentages between 32 and 33%, whereas the ''Lexington''-class battlecruiser design had a nearly identical armor percentage of 28.5%. In fact, older battlecruisers, such as {{sclass-|Invincible|battlecruiser|5}} (19.9%), had a significantly ''lower'' percentage.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''Battleship Design and Development'', 166&amp;ndash;173&lt;/ref&gt; Armament-wise, they had much larger guns than contemporary heavy cruisers; while the ''Baltimore'' class only carried nine [[8&quot;/55 caliber gun|8&quot;/55 caliber]] Marks 12 and 15 guns,&lt;ref name=&quot;8/55 12 and 15&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = 8&quot;/55 (20.3&amp;nbsp;cm) Marks 12 and 15 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_8-55_mk12-15.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 7 February 2008 | accessdate =15 October 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081002055750/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_8-55_mk12-15.htm| archivedate= 2 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Alaska'' class carried nine [[12&quot;/50 caliber Mark 8 gun|12&quot;/50 caliber gun]]s that were as good as, if not superior to, the old [[14&quot;/50 caliber gun]] used on the U.S. Navy's pre-treaty battleships.&lt;ref name=&quot;12/50&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = 12&quot;/50 (30.5&amp;nbsp;cm) Mark 8 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_12-50_mk8.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 7 February 2008 | accessdate =15 October 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921170348/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_12-50_mk8.htm| archivedate= 21 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Main battery ===
[[Image:USS Guam (CB-2) firing main battery, 1944-45.jpg|thumb|right|''Guam'' firing her main battery during a training session sometime in 1944–1945.]]

As built, the ''Alaska'' class had nine [[12&quot;/50 caliber Mark 8 gun|12&quot;/50 caliber]] Mark 8 guns mounted in three triple (3-gun) turrets,&lt;ref name=&quot;12/50&quot;/&gt; with two turrets forward and one aft, a configuration known as &quot;2-A-1&quot;. The previous 12&quot; gun manufactured for the U.S. Navy was the Mark 7 version, which had been designed for and installed in the 1912 {{sclass-|Wyoming|battleship|2}}s. The Mark 8 was of considerably higher quality; in fact, it &quot;was by far the most powerful weapon of its caliber ever placed in service.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dulin and Garzke, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed in 1939, it weighed {{convert|121856|lb|kg}}, including the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]], and could sustain an average rate of fire of 2.4–3 rounds a minute. It could throw a {{convert|1140|lb|kg|adj=on}} Mark 18 [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] shell {{convert|38573|yd|m|0}} at an elevation of 45°, and had a 344-shot barrel life&lt;ref name=&quot;12/50&quot;/&gt; (about 54 more than the much larger but similar [[16&quot;/50 caliber Mark 7 gun]] found in the ''Iowa'' battleships.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = United States of America 16&quot;/50 (40.6&amp;nbsp;cm) Mark 7 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk7.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 7 February 2008 | accessdate =16 October 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921165815/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk7.htm| archivedate= 21 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Alaska''s{{'}} Mark 8 guns were the heaviest main battery of any cruiser of World War II, and as capable as the old [[14&quot;/50 caliber gun]] used on the U.S. Navy's pre-treaty battleships.&lt;ref name=&quot;12/50&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = 12&quot;/50 (30.5&amp;nbsp;cm) Mark 8 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_12-50_mk8.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 7 February 2008 | accessdate =15 October 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921170348/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_12-50_mk8.htm| archivedate= 21 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turrets were very similar to those of the ''Iowa''-class battleships, but differed in several ways; for example, the ''Alaska'' class had a two-stage powder hoist instead of the ''Iowa'' class's one-stage hoist. These differences made operating the guns safer and increased the rate of fire. In addition, a &quot;projectile rammer&quot; was added to ''Alaska'' and ''Guam''. This machine transferred shells from storage on the ship to the rotating ring that fed the guns. However, this feature proved unsatisfactory, and it was not planned for ''Hawaii'' or any subsequent ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;12/50&quot;/&gt;

Because ''Alaska'' and ''Guam'' were the only two ships to mount these guns, only ten turrets were made during the war (three for each ship including ''Hawaii'' and one spare). They cost $1,550,000 each and were the most expensive heavy guns purchased by the U.S. Navy in World War II.&lt;ref name=Morison85/&gt;

=== Secondary battery ===
The secondary battery of the ''Alaska'' class was composed of twelve dual-purpose (anti-air and anti-ship) [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun]]s in twin mounts, with four offset on each side of the superstructure (two on each beam) and two centerline turrets fore and aft. The 5&quot;/38 was originally intended for use on only [[destroyer]]s built in the 1930s, but by 1934 and into World War II it was being installed on almost all of the U.S.'s major warships, including aircraft carriers, battleships, and heavy and light cruisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;5/38&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = United States of America 5&quot;/38 (12.7&amp;nbsp;cm) Mark 12 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_5-38_mk12.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 27 March 2008 | accessdate =25 July 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080905181826/http://navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_5-38_mk12.htm| archivedate= 5 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-aircraft battery ===
For anti-aircraft armament, the ''Alaska''-class ships carried 56 × 40&amp;nbsp;mm guns and 34 × 20&amp;nbsp;mm guns. These numbers are comparable to 48 × 40&amp;nbsp;mm and 24 × 20&amp;nbsp;mm on the smaller ''Baltimore''-class heavy cruisers and 80 × 40&amp;nbsp;mm and 49 × 20&amp;nbsp;mm on the larger ''Iowa'' battleships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Baltimore | url = http://hazegray.org/danfs/cruisers/ca68.txt | accessdate=15 October 2008|short=yes|link=no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080906103026/http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/cruisers/ca68.txt| archivedate= 6 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Iowa | url = http://hazegray.org/danfs/battlesh/bb61.htm | accessdate=15 October 2008|short=yes|link=no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080920053724/http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/battlesh/bb61.htm| archivedate= 20 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the most efficient light [[anti-aircraft gun]] of World War II, the [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40 mm Bofors]] was used on nearly every major warship in the U.S. and UK fleets during World War&amp;nbsp;II from about 1943 to 1945. Although they were a descendant of German and Swedish designs, the Bofors mounts used by the United States Navy during World War II had been heavily &quot;Americanized&quot; to U.S. Navy standards. This new standard resulted in a gun system set to English standards (now known as the [[United States customary units|Standard System]]) with interchangeable ammunition, simplifying the logistics situation for World War II. When coupled with hydraulic couple drives to reduce salt contamination and the Mark&amp;nbsp;51 director for improved accuracy, the 40&amp;nbsp;mm Bofors became a fearsome adversary, accounting for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bofors&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = Sweden, British, USA, German and Japanese Bofors 40 mm/56 (1.57&quot;) Model 1936 | url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_4cm-56_mk12.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 14 May 2008 | accessdate =25 July 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080705110132/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_4cm-56_mk12.htm| archivedate= 5 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oerlikon Contraves|Oerlikon]] [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm anti-aircraft gun]] was one of the most extensively used anti-aircraft guns of World War&amp;nbsp;II; the U.S. alone manufactured a total of 124,735 of these guns. When activated in 1941, they replaced the 0.50&quot; [[M2 Browning machine gun]] on a one-for-one basis. The Oerlikon gun remained the primary anti-aircraft weapon of the United States Navy until the introduction of the 40&amp;nbsp;mm Bofors in 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oerlikon&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = British, Swiss and USA 20 mm/70 (0.79&quot;) Oerlikon Marks 1, 2, 3 and 4 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_2cm-70_mk234.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 14 July 2008 | accessdate =25 July 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807181048/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_2cm-70_mk234.htm| archivedate= 7 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
