The '''Free Syrian Army''' ({{lang-ar|الجيش السوري الحر}}, ''{{transl|ar|al-Jaysh as-Sūrī al-Ḥurr}}'', '''FSA''') was, or is still, a faction in the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=WallSt.5-10-11&gt;{{cite news|last=Albayrak|first=Ayla|title= Turkey is adding to pressure on Damascus |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204524604576610781937462842.html|accessdate=19 August 2014|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldTr.3-8-11&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2011/me_syria0973_08_03.asp|title=Defecting troops form 'Free Syrian Army', target Assad security forces| newspaper=World Tribune|date=3 August 2011|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded on 29 July 2011&lt;ref name=Land.29-7-11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=11043|title=Free Syrian Army Founded by Seven Officers to Fight the Syrian Army|publisher=Syria Comment|first=Joshua|last=Landis|date=29 July 2011|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by officers of the  [[Syrian Armed Forces]] who said their goal was to bring down the Assad government&lt;ref name=WorldTr.3-8-11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Land.29-7-11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holl.March2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Joseph|title=Syria's Armed Opposition|journal=Institute for the Study of War|date=March 2012|series=Middle East Security Report 3|url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Syrias_Armed_Opposition.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2014}} (Pages 6, 14–17.)&lt;/ref&gt; and was in late 2011 considered the main Syrian military defectors group.&lt;ref name=Albayrak/&gt;&lt;ref name=youtube9-10-11/&gt; From July 2012 onward, ill-discipline and infighting weakened FSA, while [[Syrian Civil War#Mujahideen|jihadist groups]] became dominant within the armed opposition.&lt;ref name=guardian12-7-13&gt;{{cite news|author=Martin Chulov|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/12/free-syrian-army-officer-killed|title=Free Syrian Army threatens blood feud after senior officer killed by jihadists|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2013-08-31|location=London|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013 onwards, (Western) war observers are polemizing over whether FSA still exists or has become more of a 'myth' with hardly any real impact.

=== 2011 – Formation and attacking the Syrian army ===

The first defections from the [[Syrian Army]] during the [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian uprising]] may have occurred end of April 2011 when the army was sent into [[Siege of Daraa|Daraa to quell ongoing protests]]. There were reports that some units refused to fire on protesters and had split from the army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/04/20114309234489989.html Fresh violence hits Syrian town]. Al Jazeera (2011-04-30). Retrieved on 2012-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Video footage showed civilians helping defecting soldiers who had been shot for refusing orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.aljazeera.com/live/middle-east/syria-live-blog-april-28 Syria Live Blog – April 28]. Al Jazeera. Retrieved on 2012-03-23. {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defections, according to unverified reports, continued throughout the spring as the government used [[lethal force]] to clamp down on protesters and lay siege to protesting cities across the country, such as [[Siege of Baniyas|Baniyas]], [[Siege of Hama (2011)|Hama]], [[Siege of Talkalakh|Talkalakh]], and [[Deir ez-Zor clashes (2011–14)|Deir ez-Zor]], and there were reports of soldiers who refused to fire on civilians and were [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] by the army.&lt;ref name=defect&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/06/201168175624573155.html|title='Defected Syria security agent' speaks out|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=8 June 2011|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of July 2011, with the [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian uprising (or civil war)]] running since March 2011, a group of defected Syrian Army officers established the ‘Free Syrian Army’ to bring down the Assad government. On 29 July 2011, Colonel [[Riad al-Asaad]] and a group of uniformed officers announced the formation of the Free Syrian Army or 'Syrian Free Army',&lt;ref name=News,30Jul11&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian colonel claims big defection|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Syrian-colonel-claims-big-defection-20110730|accessdate=2 November 2015|work=News24|date=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goals of protecting unarmed protesters and helping to &quot;bring down this regime&quot;, in a video on the Internet where Riad al-Asaad spoke alongside several other defectors.&lt;ref name=Land.29-7-11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sharq&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aawsat.com/2011/08/article55245595/syrian-army-colonel-defects-forms-free-syrian-army|work=Asharq Alawsat|title=Syrian Army Colonel Defects forms Free Syrian Army|date=1 August 2011|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel [[Riad al-Asaad|Al-Asaad]] explained that the Free Army’s formation resulted from the defecting soldiers' sense of nationalistic duty, loyalty to the people, the need for decisive action to stop government killings, and the army’s responsibility to protect unarmed people. He proceeded to announce the formation of the Free Syrian Army, and its intention to work hand in hand with the people and with demonstrators to achieve freedom and dignity, bring the government (&quot;the regime&quot;/&quot;the system&quot;) down, protect the revolution and the country’s resources, and stand in the face of the irresponsible military machine that protects the &quot;system&quot;.&lt;ref name=WorldTr.3-8-11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sharq&quot; /&gt;

Colonel [[Riad al-Asaad|Al-Asaad]] called on the officers and men of the Syrian army to &quot;defect from the army, stop pointing their rifles at their people's chests, join the free army, and form a national army that can protect the revolution and all sections of the Syrian people with all their sects.&quot; He said that the Syrian army &quot;[represents] gangs that protect the regime&quot;, and declared that &quot;as of now, the security forces that kill civilians and besiege cities will be treated as legitimate targets. We will target them in all parts of the Syrian territories without exception&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;sharq&quot; /&gt; 
&quot;you will find us everywhere at all times, and you will see that which you do not expect, until we re-establish the rights and freedom of our people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raman |first=Suby |title=The Beginnings of the Syrian Civil War |url=http://subyraman.com/the-beginnings-of-the-syrian-civil-war/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233656/http://subyraman.com/the-beginnings-of-the-syrian-civil-war/ |date=20 November 2011|archivedate=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desertion of soldiers to the Free Syrian Army was allegedly documented in videos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzNmoU6PkjQ&amp;feature=related ادلب – جبل الزاوية تشكيل كتيبة شهداء جبل الزاوية 12–15].

Retrieved on 2012-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2011, the Free Syrian Army merged with the Free Officers Movement ({{lang-ar|حركة الضباط الأحرار}}, ''{{transl|ar|Ḥarakat aḑ-Ḑubbāṭ al-Aḥrār}}''); '' [[The Wall Street Journal]]'' considered the FSA since then the main military defectors group.&lt;ref name=Albayrak&gt;{{cite news |last=Albayrak|first=Ayla|title=Turkey Is Adding Pressure on Damascus|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204524604576610781937462842.html|accessdate=28 February 2016 | newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=youtube9-10-11&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2016}}{{cite web|title=Syria Army Defectors Press Conference – 9–23–11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttfy6h2BMyo|publisher=Syria2011archives|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As deserted government soldiers had no armored vehicles and only light weaponry and munitions, FSA in August–October 2011 mostly ambushed security forces and the state's [[Shabiha]] (ghost) militia, and attacked trucks and buses bringing in security reinforcements by planting bombs or with hit-and-run attacks, but seldom confronted other regular army soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hafez&quot; /&gt;

By October 2011, the leadership of the FSA consisting of 60–70 people including commander Riad al-Assad was harbored in an ‘officers’ camp’ in [[Turkey]] guarded by Turkish military.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stack&quot; /&gt; 
Early November 2011, two FSA units in the Damascus area confronted regime forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtoninstitute.org&quot;/&gt; In mid-November, in an effort to weaken the pro-Assad forces, the FSA released a statement which announced that a temporary military council had been formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;VoA-LIPIN-16-11-2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Syrian-Army-Defectors-Go-on-Offense-Militarizing-Syrias-Uprising-133963348.html|title=Syrian Army Defectors Go on Offense, Militarizing Syria's Uprising|last=Lipin|first=Michael|date=16 November 2011|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, an American official said the Syrian military might have lost perhaps 10,000 to defections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/world/middleeast/army-defectors-in-syria-take-credit-for-deadly-attack.html|work=The New York Times|first=Nada|last=Bakri|title=Defectors Claim Attack That Killed Syrian Soldiers|date=26 October 2011|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the FSA operated throughout Syria, both in urban areas and countryside, in the northwest of Syria ([[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]] and [[Aleppo Governorate]]s), the central region ([[Homs Governorate|Homs]] and [[Hama Governorate]]s, [[Al-Rastan District]]), the coast around [[Latakia]], the south ([[Daraa Governorate]] and the [[Hauran|Houran plateau]]), the east ([[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]], [[Al-Bukamal District]]), and the [[Damascus Governorate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtoninstitute.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=3429|title=Asad's Armed Opposition: The Free Syrian Army|last=White|first=Jeffrey|date=30 November 2011|work=PolicyWatch #1878|publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSA was then armed with rifles, light and heavy machine guns, [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and explosive devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtoninstitute.org&quot;/&gt; Their largest concentrations  were in Homs, Hama and surrounding areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtoninstitute.org&quot;/&gt;

The FSA, after consultation with the [[Syrian National Council]] (SNC) in November 2011, agreed to not attack Syrian army units that are staying in their barracks, and concentrate on protecting and defending civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria opposition groups agree to coordinate efforts|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/01/world/la-fg-syria-accord-20111202|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=10 February 2012|first1=Alexandra|last1=Zavis|first2=Rima|last2=Marrouch|date=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, &quot;The Free Syrian Army boasts it has as many 25,000 fighters in its ranks, a number challenged by its critics who say the true figure is closer to 1,000&quot;.&lt;ref name=telegrNov2011&gt;{{cite news|last=Blomfield|first=Adam|title=Syrian rebels strike heart of Damascus|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/8902832/Syrian-rebels-strike-heart-of-Damascus.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=21 November 2011|accessdate=25 May 2016|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; early December, the US ''[[International Business Times]]'' stated that the FSA counted 15,000 ex-Syrian soldiers.&lt;ref name=IBT2Dc11&gt;{{cite news |title=Free Syrian Army Partners with Opposition: What's Next for Syria? |first=Daniel |last=Torvov |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/259730/20111202/syria-assad-free-syrian-army-sanctions.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125115848/http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/259730/20111202/syria-assad-free-syrian-army-sanctions.htm |archivedate=25 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |work=International Business Times |date=2 December 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western sources in December 2011 again gave estimates of 10,000 Syrian deserters, indicated that half the Syrian army conscripts had not reported to army duty in the last three call-ups, and that lower-level officers were deserting in large numbers; in some cases, whole units had deserted ''en masse''.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAARETZ21Dec11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/assad-losing-control-as-10-000-soldiers-desert-syrian-military-1.402625|title=Assad losing control as 10,000 soldiers desert Syrian military|first1=Avi|last1=Issacharoff|first2=Amos|last2=Harel|date=21 December 2011|work=Haaretz|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymously speaking U.S. official however estimated in December 2011 1,000 to 3,500 defectors in total.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/world/middleeast/syria-army-defectors-said-to-kill-soldiers-in-coordinated-assault.html|work=The New York Times|first=Nada|last=Bakri|title=Syria Army Defectors Reportedly Kill 27 Soldiers|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said in an interview on 12 January 2012: &quot;If we get 25,000 to 30,000 deserters mounting guerrilla warfare in small groups of six or seven it is enough to exhaust the army in a year to a year-and-a-half, even if they are armed only with rocket-propelled grenades and light weapons&quot;.&lt;ref name=reut13Jan2012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/01/13/uk-syria-defections-idUKTRE80C0ST20120113|title=Syria's army weakened by growing desertions|first=Khaled Yacoub|last=Oweis|date=13 January 2012|agency=Reuters|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2012, Colonel Afeef Mahmoud Suleima of the [[Syrian Air Force]] logistics division defected from Bashar Al Assad's regime along with at least fifty of his men. He announced his group's defection on live television and ordered his men to protect protesters in the city of [[Hama]]. Colonel Suleima in a statement declared: &quot;We are from the army and we have defected because the government is killing civilian protesters.

A typical field unit such as the Tel Kalakh Martyrs’ Brigade numbers between 300 and 400 fighters split into combat units of six to 10 men. Each man in the unit is armed with a light weapon, such as an [[AK-47]], and the combat unit as a whole is equipped with an RPG launcher and a light [[machine gun]].

Free Syrian Army units specialize in different tasks. Units close to the borders are involved with logistics and the transport of injured soldiers out of the country and also with the transport medical equipment, material supplies and weapons into the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;al-akhbarii&quot;&gt;[http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/wadi-khaled-free-syrian-army-base-lebanon-ii Wadi Khaled: The Free Syrian Army Base in Lebanon (II)].

=== 2013 – Outstripped by al-Nusra===
During 2013, within the Syrian [[Syrian Civil War#Opposition parties|anti-Assad opposition]] as a whole, alliances between the independently operating rebel brigades were constantly changing; many FSA brigades ran over in 2013 to the [[Islamic Front (Syria)|Islamic Front]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2016}}

In April 2013, the [[United States|US]] announced it would transfer $123 million in nonlethal aid to Syrian rebels through the Supreme Military Council led by defected general [[Salim Idriss]], the then Chief of Staff of FSA.&lt;ref name=&quot;McClatchySalimIdriss&quot; /&gt;

In April–May 2013, FSA was losing fighters to Islamist organisation [[Al-Nusra Front]] which was emerging as the best-equipped, financed and motivated anti-Assad force, concluded ''[[The Guardian]]'' after interviewing FSA commanders across Syria.&lt;ref name=guar8May2013/&gt; FSA commander Basha said that in the last few months 3,000 FSA fighters had gone over to al-Nusra, mainly because FSA lacks weapons and ammunition. Another FSA commander said that also the Islamic doctrine of al-Nusra attracts FSA fighters. A Western diplomat played down suggestions that Nusra would be cleaner, better and stronger: &quot;fighters are moving from one group to another&quot;, but you can’t say that Nusra has in general more momentum than others, he maintained.&lt;ref name=guar8May2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/08/free-syrian-army-rebels-defect-islamist-group |title=Free Syrian Army rebels defect to Islamist group Jabhat al-Nusra |date=8 May 2013|accessdate=25 February 2016 |work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, [[Salim Idriss]], the FSA leader, said that &quot;the rebels&quot; were badly fragmented and lacked the military skill needed to topple the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Idriss said he was working on a countrywide command structure, but that a lack of material support—ammunition and weapons, fuel for the cars and money for logistics and salaries—was hurting that effort. &quot;The battles are not so simple now,&quot; Idriss said. &quot;Now it is very important for them to be unified. But unifying them in a manner to work like a regular army is still difficult.&quot; He denied any cooperation with Al-Nusra Front but acknowledged common operations with another Islamist group [[Ahrar ash-Sham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McClatchySalimIdriss&quot; /&gt;

The growth of [[al-Nusra Front]] and other Islamist groups, during the first half of 2013, disillusioned thousands of FSA men who felt that their own revolution against the government has been stolen from them.&lt;ref name=Indep29-9-13 /&gt; In areas of Homs province, fighting between FSA and the Syrian army had virtually ceased.&lt;ref name=Indep29-9-13&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/a-syrian-solution-to-civil-conflict-the-free-syrian-army-is-holding-talks-with-assads-senior-staff-8847615.html|title=A Syrian solution to civil conflict?

On 11 July 2013, an FSA officer was assassinated by a jihadist group, north of [[Latakia]].&lt;ref name=guardian12-7-13 /&gt; In mid-August 2013, a delegation of FSA met with an official of President Assad, to suggest talks between government and FSA about &quot;a Syrian solution&quot; to the war.&lt;ref name=Indep29-9-13 /&gt; The government accepted this proposal for &quot;a dialogue within the Syrian homeland&quot;. Six weeks later, in seven rebel-held areas of Aleppo, civil employees could return to work, and government institutions and schools could reopen.&lt;ref name=Indep29-9-13 /&gt;

[[Salafi movement|Salafist]]-[[Jihadism|jihadist]] leader Mohammed Shalabi in [[Jordan]], also known as Abu Sayyaf, 
stated in July 2013 in ''[[Ammon News]]'' that irreconcilable differences exist between the aims of FSA and those of other Sunni militias fighting in Syria against Assad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ammonnews.net/article.aspx?articleno=22322#.Ueh5fPmTjoI|title=Jordanian Salafist Leader Foresees Conflict with Secular Syrian Opposition|publisher=En.ammonnews.net|date=2013-07-16|accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, an FSA YouTube channel broadcast an interview with an al-Nusra leader who described how al-Nusra engineers were able to breach a regime building with explosives.&lt;ref name=&quot;cafarella&quot; /&gt; Locals near the Turkish border complained in November 2013 that, in contrast with [[al-Nusra Front]], the groups aligned with FSA were becoming increasingly corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jamie Dettmer|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/01/12/syria-s-rebel-rivalry-between-jihadists-and-fsa.html|title=Syria’s Rebel Rivalry Between Jihadists and FSA|work=The Daily Beast|date=2013-01-12|accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, US Special Operation Forces veteran and author Jack Murphy wrote that &quot;as early as 2013, FSA commanders were defecting with their entire units to join al-Nusra. There, they still retain the FSA monicker, but it is merely for show, to give the appearance of secularism so they can maintain access to weaponry provided by the CIA and Saudi intelligence services. The reality is that the FSA is little more than a cover for the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack Murphy|url=https://sofrep.com/63764/us-special-forces-sabotage-white-house-policy-gone-disastrously-wrong-with-covert-ops-in-syria/|title=US Special Forces sabotage White House policy gone disastrously wrong with covert ops in Syria|publisher=SOFREP|date=2016-09-14|accessdate=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, U.S. senior military officials speaking on condition of anonymity indicated that the Pentagon estimates that &quot;extreme Islamist groups&quot; constitute &quot;more than 50 percent&quot; of the Free Syrian Army labeled groups with the percentage &quot;growing by the day&quot;.&lt;ref name=nbc2013/&gt;

=== 2014 – FSA dwindles, rebels join ISIL ===
The US ''[[International Business Times|IBT]]'' considered the emergence of ISIL in 2014 as the beginning of the end for groups like FSA which the US had dubbed “moderate rebels”.&lt;ref name=&quot;doesnot3&quot;&gt;Erin Banco, [http://www.ibtimes.com/four-years-later-free-syrian-army-has-collapsed-1847116 &quot;Four Years Later, The Free Syrian Army Has Collapsed&quot;], ''International Business Times'', 14 March 2015.

In February 2014, Colonel Qassem Saadeddine of the FSA announced that Chief of Staff Idris had been replaced with Brigadier General [[Abdul-Ilah al-Bashir]], due to &quot;the paralysis within the military command these past months.&quot;&lt;ref name=aljaz18Feb14&gt;{{cite news|title=Free Syrian Army fires military chief|publisher=Al Jazeera English|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/02/free-syrian-army-fires-military-chief-201421742719901171.html|date=18 February 2014|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2014, a 'Supreme Military Council of Syria'--presumably meaning the [[Free Syrian Army#Command structure|'Supreme Military Council']] that is the Head command of the FSA—which is said to include the FSA and &quot;moderate Muslim rebel groups&quot;, allied with a predominantly Christian coalition called the [[Syriac Military Council]], to unite their fight against the Assad government and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL).&lt;ref name=&quot;SyriacMilitaryCouncil&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/25/world/meast/us-syria-rebel-agreement/ |last1=Bronstein |first1=Scott |last2=Griffin |first2=Drew |title=Syrian rebel groups unite to fight ISIS |publisher=CNN |date=26 September 2014| accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germany|German]] journalist [[Jürgen Todenhöfer]], having toured for ten days in [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]-held territory in late 2014, said that the ISIL leadership had said to him: if the FSA get a good weapon, they sell it to us; FSA are our best arms sellers.&lt;ref name=Hersh&gt;[[Seymour Hersh]],[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n01/seymour-m-hersh/military-to-military 'Military to Military,'] [[London Review of Books]],Vol. 38 No. 1,7 January 2016 pp.11-14.

=== 2015 – Debates as to whether FSA still exists ===

In June 2015, the ''[[International Business Times]]'' stated that since the emergence of ISIL on the Syrian battlefield in 2014, the FSA had &quot;all but dissipated&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;banco&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Banco|first1=Erin|title=Syrian Rebel Groups Merge To Take On Assad In Dera’a, But Deep Divisions Remain|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/syrian-rebel-groups-merge-take-assad-deraa-deep-divisions-remain-1984616|accessdate=28 February 2016|publisher=International Business Times|date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported that the remnants of the FSA had joined the coalitions of the [[Army of Conquest]] (Islamist) and the [[Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army|Southern Front]] (ranging from secularist to moderate religious&lt;ref name=Hai&gt;{{cite web |url= http://lb.boell.org/en/2015/08/21/southern-front-allies-without-strategy |title=The Southern Front: allies without a strategy |first=Haid |last=Haid |date=21 August 2015 |publisher=[[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in their assault on Dera'a, south of Damascus.&lt;ref name=&quot;banco&quot;/&gt;

In December 2015, according to the American [[Institute for the Study of War]] who still upheld the idea of FSA as army or group, FSA-labeled groups were still present around Aleppo and Hama and in southern Syria, and the FSA was still “the biggest and most secular of the rebel groups” fighting the Assad government, but had taken the brunt of [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|the Russian air attacks in Syria since 30 September 2015]].&lt;ref name=ISWDec2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/12/free-syrian-army-morale-russia-strikes.html|title=Can FSA get back on its feet after Russian intervention?|publisher=''Al-Monitor'' ([[Institute for the Study of War]])|first=Mona |last=Alami |date=31 December 2015|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Main stream Western news sources in September and October 2016 suggested that 'the Free Syrian Army' still exist as considerable army or structure of militias by mentioning or suggesting a role of the FSA in two offensives around Aleppo. &lt;br&gt;In the Syrian government’s [[Aleppo offensive (September–October 2016)|offensive late September 2016 on (eastern) Aleppo]], according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', some of the defending rebel groups identified themselves as Free Syrian Army (FSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/world/middleeast/aleppo-syria-ground-offensive.html|title=Syrian Troops Clash With Rebels as Bombs Fall on Aleppo|last=Saad|first=Hwaida|date=27 September 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Aleppo offensive (October–November 2016)|October–November Aleppo offensive]] of rebel forces against the Syrian Assad government forces, the [[France|French]] ''[[Le Figaro]]'' wrote: &quot;On 22 October 2016, violence again broke out in Aleppo between the regime forces and the rebels. (…) The insurgent groups, dominated by [[Al-Nusra Front]] ('Front for the Conquest'), have called for a general mobilization of the fighters of East-Aleppo.

== Armed groups using the Free Syrian Army label ==

===Original FSA units===
During the announcement of the formation of the FSA by Riad al-Asaad on 29 July 2011, he listed 4 small subunits which claimed to the founding members of the FSA:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aawsat.com/2011/08/article55245595/syrian-army-colonel-defects-forms-free-syrian-army|title=Syrian Army Colonel Defects forms Free Syrian Army|work=Aawsat|date=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hamza Battalion
*Freedom Battalion
*Saladin Battalion
*Al-Qashash Battalion

=== Questions of existence, structure, strength and combativeness ===

In 2013, the US [[NBC News|NBC]] stated that the FSA &quot;is an army in name only. It is made up of hundreds of small units, some secular, some religious – whether mainstream or radical. Others are family gangs, or simply criminals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nbc2013&quot;&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/extremist-element-among-syrian-rebels-growing-worry-f8C11115141 &quot;Extremist element among Syrian rebels a growing worry&quot;], NBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, [[Robert Fisk]], British Middle East correspondent since 1976 and nowadays for ''[[The Independent]]'', drew a picture of the FSA as being rather harmless and non-combating. Fisk had been traversing northern Syria talking to Syrian troops on the front line, and when asked by Australian [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]]’s television program ''[[Lateline]]'': “who are they [= the FSA] and how powerful are they?” Fisk answered: “The Free Syrian Army, I think, drinks a lot of coffee in [[Istanbul]] (…) I think that the FSA is a complete myth, and I don’t believe that it really exists, and nor do the Syrians [i.e. the Syrian Army], because they say if we do come across them, we don’t mind 'cause they always run away; it’s the  [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] people who don’t, they fight to the death”.&lt;ref name=&quot;doesnot1&quot;&gt;[[Robert Fisk]]. {{cite av media||url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIyg7xaLGTY&amp;t=9m38s|title=Robert Fisk: SAA Strongest Institution, FSA Doesn't Exist, Rebels Targeting Christians|date=12 November 2014|accessdate=4 May 2016|publisher=YouTube/[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC (Australia)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In March 2015, [[Rami Jarrah]], a prominent Syrian-British activist, claimed: &quot;There is no such thing as the Free Syrian Army, people still use the term in Syria to make it seem like the rebels have some sort of structure. But there really isn't.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;doesnot3&quot;/&gt;

In May 2015, a [[Al-Nusra Front|Jabhat al-Nusra]] spokesman said that FSA labeled fighters in southern Syria alone numbered roughly 60,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2015/0504/Syria-crisis-Spooked-by-rebel-gains-Jordan-doubles-down-on-Islamic-State|title=Syria crisis: Spooked by rebel gains, Jordan doubles down on Islamic State|date=4 May 2015|website=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(although another Nusra leader in December 2015 denied the existence of the FSA&lt;ref name=&quot;Julani&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orient-news.net/en/news_show/96917/0/Wave-of-resentment-over-words-of-alGolani-in-Syria|title=Wave of resentment over words of al-Golani in Syria|publisher=Orient News|date=31 December 2015|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In June 2015, the US ''[[International Business Times]]'' stated that since the emergence of ISIL in 2014, the FSA had &quot;all but dissipated&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;banco&quot;/&gt; and reported that the remnants of the FSA had joined the coalitions of the [[Army of Conquest]] and the [[Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army|Southern Front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;banco&quot;/&gt;

Early October 2015, Russian foreign minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] stated:  &quot;They tell us about the Free Syrian Army, but where is it? It remains a phantom group, nothing is known about it (...) I've asked [US Secretary of State] [[John Kerry]] to provide us with information about the whereabouts of this Free Syrian Army and who commands it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;doesnot4&quot;&gt;[https://www.rt.com/news/317655-moscow-contacts-free-syrian-army/ &quot;Moscow ready for contact with Free Syrian Army - FM Lavrov&quot;], RT. 5 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sana.sy/en/?p=56881|title=Lavrov: Western alliance hasn’t been effective on the ground against terrorism – Syrian Arab News Agency|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, [[Robert Fisk]] (see above) stated that the FSA had fallen to pieces and their fighters had defected to [[al-Nusra Front]] or [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] or retired to the countryside maintaining a few scattered checkpoints, and stated that the US government had already admitted the disappearance of the FSA.&lt;ref name=&quot;doesnot2&quot;&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/syria-s-moderates-have-disappeared-and-there-are-no-good-guys-a6679406.html &quot;Syria's 'moderates' have disappeared... and there are no good guys&quot;] ′′[[The Independent]]′′, 4 October 2015. Retrieved 28 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in October 2015, Irish journalist [[Patrick Cockburn]] stated that &quot;The Free Syrian Army was always a mosaic of factions and is now largely ineffectual.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/who-is-russia-bombing-in-syria-the-groups-set-for-fight-to-the-death-isis-al-nusra-a6675751.html |title=Who is Russia bombing in Syria? The militant groups determined to fight to the death |newspaper=The Independent |date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, the [[Istanbul]]-based think tank Omran Dirasat estimated the FSA self-declared groups at around 35,000 fighters spread out over thousands of groups of various sizes; 27 larger factions of around 1,000 fighters each along with a myriad of smaller groups and localised militias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/12/free-syrian-army-morale-russia-strikes.html Can FSA get back on its feet after Russian intervention?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in December 2015, [[al-Nusra Front]] leader [[Abu Mohammad al-Julani]] reportedly denied the existence of the FSA to the astonishment and intense displeasure of FSA fighters throughout Syria on social media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Julani&quot;/&gt;

In 2015 the ''[[International Business Times]]'' wrote the U.S. has sent weapons shipments to FSA labeled groups through a U.S. [[CIA]] program for years.&lt;ref name=banco /&gt; In October 2015 Reuters reported that the U.S. ([[CIA]]) and allied countries had broadened the number of rebel groups clandestinely receiving TOW missiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;perry&quot;/&gt; The ''International Business Times'' reported that TOW missile attacks against Syrian government tanks increased by 850% between September and October 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowcroft&quot; /&gt; Rebel groups associated with the FSA in November 2015 released numerous videos showing them launching TOW missiles against Syrian government forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;perry&quot; /&gt; According to Russian and Syrian sources, the missiles were delivered through Turkish territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;perry&quot; /&gt;

The number of foreign Sunni militants active within the FSA is hard to assess. In late May 2012, based on interviews with FSA fighters, it was reported that 300 Lebanese had joined the FSA. The presence of Algerians, Tunisians, Jordanians and fighters from Saudi Arabia was also confirmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailystar.com.lb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2012/May-30/175072-lebanese-join-the-free-syrian-armys-struggle.ashx#axzz1wNF5ae2M|title=Lebanese join the Free Syrian Army's struggle|work=Daily Star|accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/syria/lebanese-fighter-trains-new-generation-of-jihadis-for-syria-1.1030788|title=Lebanese fighter trains new generation of jihadis for Syria|publisher=Gulfnews.com|date=2012-06-02|accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leader of the FSA told an [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] correspondent that five Libyan combatants have been killed in clashes with the Syrian Army. The same leader, while denying the presence of many foreign fighters, said that there are few of different nationalities. Peter Harling, from the [[International Crisis Group]], told the AFP that the proportion of foreign fighters is currently very small, but might grow after Saudi Arabia and Qatar announced their support for arming the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/346709/foreign-militants-fighting-in-syria-battlefields/|title=Foreign militants fighting in Syria battlefields|date=7 March 2012|agency=Agence France-Presse|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Croatian Army|Croatian]] General Marinko Krešić confirmed that there are between 80 and 100 Croat mercenaries between the ages of 40 and 60 helping the Free Syrian Army. They are veterans from the [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991–95) or [[Bosnian War]] (1992–95), but also fought as mercenaries in [[Iraqi War]] (2003–11), [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], [[Tunisian revolution]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolution]]. Krešić stated that some are serving as security, instructors while others are killing. He also stated that they are very well trained and that &quot;they are the one who will probably kill rather than be killed&quot;. Krešić stated that their payment is up to 2,000 [[United States dollar|US$]] a day due to &quot;rich foreign donators&quot;. He also added that the majority of the volunteers coming from the Balkans to help the FSA are [[Serbs]] and citizens of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marinko Krešić, predsjednik udruge 'Hrvatski generalski zbor': Assada ruši i stotinu hrvatskih bojovnika|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Novosti/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/184341/Default.aspx|last=Jadrijević-Tomas|first=Saša|newspaper=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|date=16 August 2012|language=Croatian|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Balkanski plaćenici: Assada ruši i stotinu hrvatskih bojovnika |url=http://www.vidiportal.ba/novosti/svijet/13449-balkanski-plaenici-assada-rui-i-stotinu-hrvatskih-bojovnika |publisher=Vidportal.ba |date=17 August 2012 |language=Croatian |accessdate=18 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819235455/http://www.vidiportal.ba/novosti/svijet/13449-balkanski-plaenici-assada-rui-i-stotinu-hrvatskih-bojovnika |archivedate=August 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protiv Asada se bore i hrvatski plaćenici|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/svijet/209471/Protiv-Assada-se-bore-i-hrvatski-placenici.html|publisher=Tportal.hr|date=16 August 2012|language=Croatian|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources close to the [[Belgrade]] military circles confirmed that the former members of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] are also aiding the FSA.

There are dozens of [[Kuwait]]'s volunteers entering from Turkey that are fighting in ranks of the FSA. The volunteers are given Syrian IDs as a precautionary measure in case they are arrested, before they are armed and sent to fight in different locations across the troubled country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighters from Kuwait joining Syrian rebels – Kurd new SNC leader |url=http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/06/10/fighters-from-kuwait-joining-syrian-rebels-kurd-new-snc-leader/ |newspaper=[[Kuwait Times]] |accessdate=10 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701182649/http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/06/10/fighters-from-kuwait-joining-syrian-rebels-kurd-new-snc-leader/ |archivedate=July 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
