'''Peter Jansen Wessel Tordenskiold''' (October 28, 1690 &amp;ndash; November 12, 1720), commonly referred to as '''Tordenskjold''' (lit. ''Thunder Shield''), was a [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegian]] nobleman and an eminent naval [[flag officer]] in the service of the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy]]. He rose to the rank of [[Vice-Admiral]] for his services in the [[Great Northern War]]. Born in [[Trondheim]], Peter Wessel travelled to [[Copenhagen]] in 1704, and was employed in the navy. He won a name for himself through audacity and courage, and was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] as ''Peter Tordenskiold'' by King [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederick IV]] in 1716. His greatest exploit came later that year, as he destroyed the supply fleet of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] at the [[Battle of Dynekilen]]. In 1720, he was killed in a [[duel]]. In Denmark and Norway he is among the most famous national naval heroes. He experienced an unusually rapid rise in rank and died when he was only 30 years old.

==Name==
His birth name was Peter Jansen Wessel. His name occurs with spellings as ''Peder'' and ''Pitter''. Upon his ennoblement in 1716, he received the name ''Tordenskiold''. This was also the orthographical form which he used. In newer times, the form ''Tordenskjold'' has become usual.

==Biography==
Born in [[Trondheim]] in Norway, he was the tenth child of [[alderman]] Jan Wessel, and the brother of later [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Caspar von Wessel]]. Peter Wessel was a wild, unruly lad who gave his pious parents much trouble,&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; eventually stowing away on a ship heading for [[Copenhagen]] in 1704. In Copenhagen, he unsuccessfully sought to become a navy [[cadet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund%2c_jura_og_politik/Diverse_historie/Marine-_og_s%c3%b8krigshistorie/Peter_Wessel_Tordenskiold Peter Wessel Tordenskiold] at Gyldendals Åbne Encyklopædi&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended the king's chaplain Dr Peder Jespersen who sent Wessel on a voyage to the [[West Indies]], and finally procured for him a vacant cadetship. After further voyages, this time to the [[East Indies]], Wessel was appointed [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy]] on July 7, 1711, and went on to serve on the [[frigate]] ''Postillion''. While on ''Postillion'', he befriended Norwegian admiral baron [[Waldemar Løvendal]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; who was the first to recognize the young man's potential as a naval officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; Løvendal soon made Peter Wessel the captain of the 4-gun [[sloop]] ''Ormen'' ({{HMS|Serpent|1695|6}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;&gt;[[Carl Frederik Bricka|Bricka, Carl Frederik]], ''Dansk Biografisk Lexikon'', vol. XVII [Svend Tveskjæg - Tøxen], 1903, [http://runeberg.org/dbl/17/0444.html pp.442-453], C. With, &quot;Tordenskjold, Peder&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early service time===
Wessel started his navy service during the [[Great Northern War]] against [[Sweden]], cruising about the Swedish coast in ''Ormen'' picking up useful information about the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; In June 1712, Løvendal promoted him to the 18-gun frigate ''[[Løvendals Gallej]]'', against the advice of the Danish admiralty, who considered Wessel unreliable. After officially complaining about his dreary commanding officer [[Daniel Jacob Wilster]] in Norway, Wessel was transferred to the [[Baltic Sea]] command of [[Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve]], who appreciated and utilized Wessel's courage.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; Wessel was already renowned for two things: the audacity with which he attacked any Swedish vessels he came across regardless of the odds, and his unique seamanship, which always enabled him to evade capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Eleventh Edition]], 1911, [http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Peder_Tordenskjold Peder Tordenskjold]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Northern War had now entered upon its later stage, when [[Sweden]], beset on every side by foes, employed her fleet principally to transport troops and stores to the distressed [[Swedish Pomerania]] provinces. The audacity of Wessel impeded her at every point. He was continually snapping up transports, dashing into the fjords where her vessels lay concealed, and holding up her detached frigates.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; He was a part of Gyldenløve's fleet which succeeded in destroying a large number of Swedish transport ships at [[Rügen]] on September 29, 1712, and was promoted from Second Lieutenant to [[Captain Lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; His successes compelled the Swedes to [[Bounty (reward)|post a reward]] for his capture, while his free and easy ways also won him enemies in the Danish navy, who deplored his almost [[Privateer]]-like conduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt;

===Court-martial===
In 1714, Wessel was [[court-martial]]led after an indecisive sea battle with a Swedish frigate. The account of the incident is verified by the legal proceedings from November 1714. On July 26, 1714, he encountered a frigate under English flag near [[Lindesnes]], while flying a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] flag on the ''Løvendals Gallej'' himself. The other frigate was ''De Olbing Galley'' carrying 28 guns, which had been equipped in [[England]] for the Swedes and was on its way to [[Gothenburg]] under the command of an English captain named Bactmann. ''De Olbing Galley'' signalled for ''Løvendals Gallej'' to come closer, and as Wessel raised the Danish flag, Bactmann fired a [[broadside]] at him.&lt;ref name=&quot;bjerg&quot;&gt;Hans Christian Bjerg, &quot;[http://www.danske-tordenskiold-venner.dk/tordenskiold/artikler/02_kanon_pokal.htm På kanoner og pokaler]&quot;, [[Op-ed]] in [[Jyllands-Posten]], July 29, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; In the English captain, Wessel met a tough match.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; The combat lasted all day, and when ''De Olbing Galley'' tried to escape in the evening, Wessel set more sails and continued the duel.&lt;ref name=&quot;bjerg&quot;/&gt; The fight was interrupted by nightfall, and renewed again indecisively the following morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; Both ships were badly damaged after around 14 hours of fighting, when Wessel was running out of ammunition. He then sent an envoy to the English ship, cordially thanking the English for a good duel, and asked if he could borrow some of their ammunitions in order to continue the fight. His request was denied, and the captains drank to each other's health, before the ships dispersed.&lt;ref name=&quot;bjerg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lauring |first=Palle |title=A History of Denmark |year=1986 |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he heard about the incident, king [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] asked for the admiralty to [[court-martial]] Wessel.&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; He stood trial in November 1714, accused of disclosing vital military information about his lack of ammunition to the enemy, as well as endangering the ship of king Frederick IV by fighting a superior enemy force.&lt;ref name=&quot;bjerg&quot;/&gt; The spirit with which he defended himself and the contempt he poured on his less courageous comrades took the fancy of Frederick IV.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; He successfully argued a section of the Danish naval code which mandated attacking fleeing enemy ships no matter the size, and was acquitted on December 15, 1714. He then went to the king asking for a promotion, and was raised to the rank of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] on December 28, 1714.&lt;ref name=&quot;bjerg&quot;/&gt;

===Greatest exploits===
When, in 1715, the return of King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] from [[Turkey]] to [[Stralsund]] put new life into the dispirited Swedish forces, Wessel distinguished himself in numerous engagements off the coast of Swedish Pomerania,&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; under the command of Admiral [[Christian Carl Gabel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; He did the enemy considerable damage by cutting out his frigates and destroying his transports.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; During a battle at [[Kolberg]] on April 24, 1715, Wessel captured the Swedish [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Hans Wachtmeister]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orlogsmuseet.dk/udstil/krono1f.htm Store nordiske Krig] at Royal Danish Naval Museum&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the frigate ''Vita Örn'' (''White Eagle''), which he was granted as his new flagship under the name ''Hvide Ørn''. He then transferred to the main fleet under the command of [[Peter Raben]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt;

On returning to Denmark in the beginning of 1716 he was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] by Frederick IV under the name of ''Tordenskiold''. When in the course of 1716, Charles XII invaded Norway and laid siege to the [[Fredriksten|fortress of Fredrikshald]], Tordenskiold compelled him to raise the siege and retire to Sweden. He did so by pouncing upon the Swedish transport fleet, laden with ammunition and other military stores, which rode at anchor in the narrow and dangerous [[Dynekil Fjord]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; With two frigates and five smaller ships, he conquered or destroyed around 30 Swedish ships,&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; with little damage to himself during the [[Battle of Dynekilen]] on July 8, 1716.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt;

For this his greatest exploit, he was promoted to the rank of [[Post-Captain]], commanding the [[Kattegat]] squadron - but at the same time incurred the enmity of Christian Carl Gabel, whom he had failed to take into his confidence. Tordenskiold's first important command was the squadron with which he was entrusted in the beginning of 1717 for the purpose of destroying the Swedish Gothenburg squadron, which interrupted the communications between Denmark and Norway. Owing to the disloyalty of certain of his officers who resented serving under the young adventurer, Tordenskjold failed to do all that was expected of him. His enemies were not slow to take advantage of his partial failure. The old charge of criminal recklessness was revived against him at a second court-martial before which he was summoned in 1718, but his old patron [[Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve, Count of Samsø|Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve]] intervened energetically on his behalf, and the charge was quashed.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt;

In December 1718, Tordenskiold brought to Frederick IV the welcome news of the death of Charles XII and was in turn made Rear-Admiral. Tordenskiold captured the Swedish fortress of [[Carlsten]] at [[Marstrand]] in 1719.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; The last feat of arms during the Great Northern War was Tordenskiold's partial destruction and partial capture of the Gothenburg squadron which had so long eluded him, on September 26, 1719. He was rewarded with the rank of [[Vice-Admiral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt;

===Death by duelling===
Tordenskiold did not long survive the termination of the war. On November 12, 1720, at the age of 30, he was killed in a duel by [[Livonia]]n colonel [[Jakob Axel Staël von Holstein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; During a trip to [[Hannover]], Tordenskiold got in a fight with von Holstein, who had been in Swedish military service. The confrontation ended in a duel on the Sehlwiese in [[Gleidingen]] near [[Hildesheim]], in which Tordenskiold was run through by the sword of von Holstein.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; The circumstances around the death of Tordenskiold was set in a conspirational light, as summed up in the contemporary three volume Tordenskiold biography (1747–1750) by C. P. Rothe.&lt;ref&gt;H.D. Schepelern, [http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/hto/hto_11rk_0006-PDF/hto_11rk_0006_80526.pdf Blev Tordenskjold myrdet? En Prøve paa C. P. Rothes Kildebenyttelse], ''Historisk Tidsskrift'', vol. 11, 1960. Digitalized by the [[Royal Danish Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The duel was encouraged by a dispute with von Holstein, whom Tordenskiold offended by labeling him as a cheater at gambling. At a dinner party, Tordenskiold told of a friend who had been cheated while gambling with a man who claimed to own a [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], to which von Holstein announced he was the owner of the said creature and took offence at being called a cheater. This dispute turned into a fight, in which von Holstein unsuccessfully tried to pull a sword, after which Tordenskiold used the pommel of his own sword to beat him up. von Holstein demanded satisfaction through a duel, and it was agreed that it was to be fought with [[pistol]]s, a weapon that Tordenskiold was very skilled with. On the day of the duel, Tordenskiold's assigned second tricked him into thinking von Holstein had forfeited and left town, and convinced him to leave his firearms at home. When he arrived at the duelling field to win by default, von Holstein was waiting for him, and the duel would have to be fought with swords. Tordenskiold refused to back out, even though his sword was inferior. Tordenskiold only had his ceremonial [[smallsword|dress sword]], whereas von Holstein was armed with a Swedish cut-and-thrust military [[rapier]] (called a &quot;karolinerverge&quot;, a &quot;Carolean sword&quot;). Tordenskiold was run through by his adversary, the blow slicing two arteries wide open. He stumbled a couple of steps backwards, and died in the arms of his servant Kold.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

His corpse was brought to Copenhagen to the [[Church of Holmen]] without much ceremony, as duelling was not allowed according to Danish law of the time. In 1819, he was a buried in a [[sarcophagus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Peter Wessel Tordenskiold monument IMG 8658.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Statue of Tordenskjold in [[Trondheim]].]]
[[File:Tændstikker 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tordenskjold brand matchbox.]]
Although - Dynekilen excepted - Tordenskiold's individual victories were of less importance than [[Christen Thomesen Sehested]]'s at the [[Siege of Stralsund (1711–1715)|Siege of Stralsund]] and Ulrich Christian Gyldenløve's at Rügen, he is seen as the most heroic figure of the Great Northern War, after Charles XII.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; He is mentioned by name both in the Danish royal anthem &quot;''[[Kong Christian stod ved højen mast]]''&quot; from 1778&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/tema/fokus/nat/k31.html Kong Christian stod ved højen mast] at [[Royal Danish Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Norwegian unofficial, but used as, national anthem &quot;''[[Ja, vi elsker dette landet]]''&quot; from 1864.

Statues of him have been erected in [[Copenhagen]] (1876),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.søfartshistorie.dk/bissen/bissen28.html Tordenskjold (1690-1720)] at Søfartshistorie.dk&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trondheim]], [[Stavern]], [[Oslo]] and [[Haakonsvern]]. In the United States, [[Tordenskjold Township, Otter Tail County, Minnesota|Tordenskjold Township]] in the state of Minnesota was settled in 1871 by Danish brothers who named it after him. The [[Coat of arms of Holmestrand|coat of arms]] of [[Holmestrand]] includes his ship [[Hvide Ørn]].

The [[Royal Danish Navy]] has named several ships after him, including an early 20th century [[coastal defence ship]]. The [[Niels Juel class corvette]] [[HDMS Peter Tordenskiold (F356)|KDM ''Peter Tordenskiold'' (F356)]], served from around 1980 to August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forsvaret.dk/2ESK/Enheder/Korvetter/Pages/default.aspx Korvetter af NIELS JUEL-klassen] at [[Royal Danish Navy]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] has also named ships after him, such as the coastal defence ship [[HNoMS Tordenskjold|''Tordenskjold'']], and the [[Royal Norwegian Naval Training Establishment]] in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] is named [[Royal Norwegian Navy|KNM]] Tordenskjold.

The Danish city of [[Frederikshavn]] has hosted an annual summer festival in his memory since 1998. Tordenskiold was stationed there, and wrote 67 letters from there between 1717 and 1719. In 2008 the Festival attracted more than 30,000 visitors. In 2009 the Days of Tordenskiold were celebrated on 26, 27 &amp; 28 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tordenskiold.dk/ Tordenskiold Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Danish cities, there are streets named Tordenskjoldsgade after him.

The most popular brand of [[match]]es in Denmark is called Tordenskjold. In the late 1800s, Sweden had a large export production of matches, so a Danish manufacturer put Tordenskiold's portrait on his matchbox in 1882, in the hope he could once more strike at the Swedish ({{lang-da|&quot;give de svenske stryg&quot;}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;gad&quot;/&gt; The Tordenskjold brand was bought by a Swedish company in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danske-tordenskiold-venner.dk/artikler/stikkerne.htm Tordenskiold på stikkerne] at Danske-Tordenskiold-Venner&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
Though his victories were not decisive in the course of the war, he eventually attained mythic status, as one of the most successful Dano-Norwegian military commanders. As Denmark lost Norway in the 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] and consigned itself to the status of a minor power following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Tordenskiold was revived as both a Danish and Norwegian national symbol. He was portrayed as the little guy outsmarting his far more powerful adversaries, and his exploits were enhanced by mixing in myths and fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;gad&quot;&gt;''Gads Historie Leksikon'', Gads Forlag, 2006, ISBN 87-12-04259-5, pp.657-658, Nils Arne Sørensen &amp; Paul Ulff-Møller, &quot;Tordenskjold, Peder&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive fictionalized account was collected in the 1858 popular song &quot;''Jeg vil sjunge om en Helt''&quot;, and a great number of fictional plays and novels were subsequently published.&lt;ref name=&quot;gad&quot;/&gt; These accounts served as background for the 1910 Danish film &quot;''Peter Tordenskjold''&quot;, based on a [[Carit Etlar]] play,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0001358|Peter Tordenskjold (1910)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1942 film &quot;''[[Tordenskjold går i land]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0122761|Tordenskjold går i land (1942)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the two-act musical ''Tordenskjold'' opened, a mix of fact and fiction, with [[Øystein Wiik]] as Peter Wessel.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kassebeer, &quot;De vil sjunge om en helt&quot;, [[Berlingske Tidende]], September 5, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The musical was performed in [[Gladsaxe]] and [[Aarhus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ritzaus Bureau]], &quot;Klassikere og ny dramatik på Aarhus Teater&quot;, May 26, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the myths about Tordenskiold has entered into the Danish and Norwegian languages. During the negotiations for Marstrand's surrender in 1719, it is told he had his men move from block to block as he was walking the Marstrand commander through his positions, thus convincing the commander that his strength was much greater than it actually was. This gave birth to the [[idiom]] &quot;''Tordenskjold's soldiers''&quot; ({{lang-da|Tordenskjolds soldater}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; denoting the same group of people (feeling compelled to) repeatedly taking charge and fill multiple roles.
