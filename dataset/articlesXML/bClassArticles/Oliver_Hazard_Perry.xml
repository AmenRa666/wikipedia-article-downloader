'''Oliver Hazard Perry''' (August 23, 1785 – August 23, 1819) was an American naval commander, born in [[Kingston, Rhode Island|South Kingstown]], Rhode Island. He was the son of [[USN]] Captain [[Christopher Raymond Perry]] and of Sarah Wallace Alexander, and the older brother of [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Calbraith Perry]] (1794-1858).

Perry served in the West Indies during the [[Quasi War]] of 1798-1800 against France, in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] during the [[Barbary Wars]] of 1801-1815, and in the [[Caribbean]] fighting piracy and the [[African slave trade|slave trade]], but is most noted for his heroic role in the [[War of 1812]] during the [[Battle of Lake Erie]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs06|Skaggs, 2006]], p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2016}} During the War of 1812 against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], Perry supervised the building of a fleet at [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], at the age of 27.  He earned the title &quot;Hero of [[Lake Erie]]&quot; for leading American forces in a decisive naval victory at the [[Battle of Lake Erie]], receiving a Congressional Gold Medal and the Thanks of Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyclopaedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;&gt;[[#Bloom|Bloom]], Page essay&lt;/ref&gt; His [[leadership]] materially aided the successful outcomes of all nine Lake Erie military campaign victories, and the fleet victory was a turning point in the battle for the west in the War of 1812.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt; He is remembered for the words on his battle flag, &quot;Don't Give Up the Ship&quot; and his message to General [[William Henry Harrison]] which reads in part, &quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours; ...&quot;

Perry became embroiled in a long-standing and bitter controversy with the Commander of {{USS|Niagara|1813|6}}, Captain [[Jesse Elliott]], over their conduct in the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] (1813), and both were the subject of official charges. In 1815 he successfully commanded {{USS|Java|1815|2}} in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] during the [[Second Barbary War]]. So seminal was his career that he was lionized in the press (being the subject of scores of books and articles).&lt;ref name=&quot;biblio&quot;&gt;[[#Paullin|Paullin, 1918]], See ''Bibliography''&lt;/ref&gt; He has been frequently memorialized, and many places, ships and persons have been named in his honor.

==Childhood and early life==
As a boy, Perry lived in Tower Hill, [[Rhode Island]],&lt;ref name=&quot;capace&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Rhode Island |first1=Nancy |last1=Capace |location=St. Clair Shores, Michigan |page=368 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qHPYeCvnASoC&amp;pg=PA368&amp;dq=1761+Milestone#v=onepage&amp;q=1761%20Milestone&amp;f=false |isbn=9780403096107

Perry came from a long line of accomplished naval men from both sides of his family. His mother taught Perry and his younger brothers to read and write and had them attend [[Trinity Church (Newport, Rhode Island)|Trinity Episcopal Church]] regularly, where he was baptized by Reverend William Smith at the age of nine. [[Theodore Dehon]], rector of the church from 1797 to 1810 had a significant influence on the young Perry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs06|Skaggs, 2006]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island.

==Early naval career==
At twelve years of age, Perry sailed with his father to the West Indies aboard the {{USS|General Greene|1799|6}} . He was appointed a [[midshipman]] in the United States Navy on April 7, 1799, at the age of thirteen. The ship made its first stop in [[Cuba]], charged with receiving US merchant ships and providing escort from [[Havana]] to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mackenzie40|Mackenzie, 1840]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Perry's service aboard the USS General Greene continued during the [[Quasi-War]] with [[French First Republic|France]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes|Barnes, 1912]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He first experienced combat on February 9, 1800, off the coast of the French colony of [[Haiti]], which was in a [[Haitian Revolution|state of rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown, 2006]], Oliver Hazard Perry, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes|Barnes, 1912]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Barbary War]], he served aboard {{USS|Adams|1799|6}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mackenzie40|Mackenzie, 1840]], pp. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt; and later was first lieutenant (2nd in command) of  {{USS|Nautilus|1799|6}}.   He then served under Captain [[John Rodgers (1772–1838)|John Rodgers]] on the USS ''Consititution'' and USS ''Essex''.  He was placed in charge of construction of gunboats in Newport and Westerly, Rhode Island.

Beginning in April 1809, he commanded the sloop {{USS|Revenge|1806|6}}, engaging in patrol duties to enforce the [[Embargo Act]], as well as a successful raid to regain a U.S. ship held in Spanish territory in Florida. On January 9, 1811, ''Revenge'' ran aground off Rhode Island and was lost. &quot;Seeing fairly quickly that he could not save the vessel, [Perry] turned his attention to saving the crew, and after helping them down the ropes over the vessel's stern, he was the last to leave the vessel.&quot; &lt;ref name=copes&gt;{{cite journal | last = Copes | first = Jan M. | authorlink = | author2 = | title =The Perry Family: A Newport Naval Dynasty of the Early Republic| journal =Newport History: Bulletin of the Newport Historical Society | volume =66, Part 2 | issue = 227 | pages = 49–77| publisher = Newport Historical Society | location =[[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport, RI]] | date = Fall 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} The following court-martial exonerated Perry, placing blame on the ship's pilot.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;His progression from being the subject of a [[court-martial]] for running aground to being a formidable commander who made a real difference has a striking parallel to the career of Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BHgAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Oliver Hazard Perry|first1=James Fenimore |last1=Cooper | authorlink = James Fenimore Cooper |publisher=[[Graham's Magazine]] |volume=XXII |date=May 1843 |page=268 |accessdate=January 7, 2011 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, a team of divers claimed to have discovered the remains of ''Revenge'', nearly 200 years to the day after it sank.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/01/07/us/AP-US-Shipwreck-Discovered.html?hp|title=Divers: 1811 Wreck of Perry Ship Discovered Off RI|publisher=New York Times (Associated Press report)|date=January 7, 2011|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2011/01/08/divers-say-theyve-found-1811-wreck-of-oliver-hazard-perry-ship/|title=Divers Say They've Found 1811 Wreck of Perry Ship|publisher=AOL News|date=January 8, 2011|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the court-martial, Perry was given a leave of absence from the navy. On May 5, 1811, he married Elizabeth Champlin Mason of Newport, Rhode Island, whom he had met at a dance in 1807.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham&quot;/&gt; They enjoyed an extended honeymoon touring New England. The couple would eventually have five children, with one dying in infancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/pevi/historyculture/perry.htm|title=Oliver Hazard Perry – Perry's Victory &amp; International Peace Memorial|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of 1812==

At the beginning of the War of 1812 the [[Royal navy|British Navy]] controlled the [[Great Lakes]], except for [[Lake Huron]], while the American Navy controlled [[Lake Champlain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs06|Skaggs, 2006]], p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; American naval forces were very small, allowing the British to make many advances in the [[Great Lakes]] and northern New York [[:File:Grlakes lawrence map.png|waterways]]. The roles played by commanders like Oliver Hazard Perry, at [[Lake Erie]] and [[Isaac Chauncey]] at [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Thomas Macdonough]] at [[Lake Champlain]] all proved vital to the naval effort that provided the most redeeming military feature of that war.  Naval historian [[E. B. Potter]] noted that &quot;all naval officers of the day made a special study of [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson's]] battles&quot;.  Oliver Perry was no exception.
&lt;ref name=potter&gt;[[#Potter|Potter, 1981]], p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;
At his request he was given command of United States naval forces on [[Lake Erie]] during the [[War of 1812]]. U.S. Secretary of the Navy [[Paul Hamilton (politician)|Paul Hamilton]] had charged prominent merchant seaman [[Daniel Dobbins]] with building the American fleet on [[Presque Isle Bay]] at [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], Pennsylvania, and Perry was named chief naval officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyclopaedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;National Portrait&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DFUYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PT386 |title=The national portrait gallery of distinguished Americans |volume=1 |first1=James |last1=Herring |first2=James Barton |last2=Longacre |publisher=D. Rice &amp; A.N. Hart |place=Philadelphia |year=1854 |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry knew battle was coming, and he &quot;consciously followed Nelson's example in describing his battle plans to his captains.&quot;&lt;ref name=potter/&gt;{{rp|218}}  Perry's instructions were:

{{Quotation|''Commanding officers are particularly enjoined to pay attention in preserving their stations in the Line, and in all cases to keep as near the ''Lawrence'' as possible. ...Engage your designated adversary, in close action, at half cable's length.'' {{#Tag:ref|A &quot;cable&quot; is 720 feet in the Royal Navy, {{convert|600|ft|m|0}} in the U.S. Navy.  &quot;Half cable's length&quot; would be less than {{convert|330|ft|m}}. |group=upper-alpha}}&lt;ref name = altoff&gt;{{cite book|last=Altoff|first=Gerard T.|authorlink=|title=Oliver Hazard Perry and the Battle of Lake Erie|publisher=The Perry Group|edition = |location=[[Put-in-Bay, Ohio|Put-in-Bay, OH]]|year = 1999 |isbn = 978-1887794039  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; |Oliver H.

===Hero of Lake Erie===
[[File:BattleofLakeErie.jpg|thumb|left|264px|Perry (standing) after abandoning ''Lawrence'' in a 1911 painting by [[Edward Percy Moran]]]]

On September 10, 1813, Perry's command fought a successful [[fleet action]] against a squadron of the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Battle of Lake Erie]]. It was at the outset of this battle that Perry famously said, “If a victory is to be gained, I will gain it.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Farmer&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Od5AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA283 Farmer, Silas. (1884) (Jul 1969) ''The history of Detroit and Michigan, or, The metropolis illustrated: a chronological cyclopaedia of the past and present: including a full record of territorial days in Michigan, and the annuals of Wayne County'', p. 283] and [https://openlibrary.org/works/OL161750W/The_history_of_Detroit_and_Michigan_or_The_metropolis_illustrate Various formats at] [[Open Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the exchange of gunfire favored the British. Perry's [[flagship]], the {{USS|Lawrence|1813|6}}, was so severely disabled in the encounter that the British commander, [[Robert Heriot Barclay]], thought that Perry would surrender it, and sent a small boat to request that the American vessel pull down its flag. Faithful to the words of his [[Naval Ensign|battle flag]], &quot;DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP&quot; (a paraphrase of the dying words of Captain [[James Lawrence]], the ship's namesake and Perry's friend),&lt;ref name=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/trivia/trivia02.htm |title=Famous Navy Quotes: Who Said Them and When |publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Once aboard, Perry dispatched ''Niagara''{{'s}} commander, Captain [[Jesse Elliot]], to bring the other schooners into closer action while he steered the ''Niagara'' toward the damaged British ships. Like Nelson's {{HMS|Victory||2}} at Trafalgar, ''Niagara'' broke the opposing line. Perry's force pounded Barclay's ships until they could offer no effective resistance and surrendered. Although he had won the battle aboard ''Niagara'', he received the British surrender on the deck of the recaptured ''Lawrence'' to allow the British to see the terrible price his men had paid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farmer&quot;/&gt; Perry's battle report to General [[William Henry Harrison]] was famously brief: &quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours; two ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;quotes&quot;/&gt;{{#Tag:Ref|The British order of battle was actually two ships, ''one'' brig, ''two'' schooners and one sloop.&lt;ref name=rooz/&gt;{{rp|260–261}}  &quot;Perry's message was inaccurate.&quot; &lt;ref name = altoff/&gt;{{rp|Note 129, p. 97.}}|group=upper-alpha}}
[[File:DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP flag.svg|200px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Perry's battle flag]]
This was the first time in history that an entire British naval squadron had surrendered, and every captured ship was successfully returned to Presque Isle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs00|Skaggs, 2000]], p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skaggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/navalhistory/2009-04/perry-triumphant |last1=Skaggs |first1=David Curtis |title=Perry Triumphant |date=April 2009 |volume=23 |journal=[[Naval History (magazine)|Naval History Magazine]] |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the engagement was small compared to Napoleonic naval battles such as the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], the victory had disproportionate strategic importance, opening Canada up to possible invasion, while simultaneously protecting the entire [[Ohio Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q_HIcc8n3K4C&amp;pg=PA48 Symonds, Craig L; Clipson, William J. (April 2001) ''The Naval Institute historical atlas of the U.S. Navy'' Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press 264pp, ISBN 978-1-55750-984-0; ISBN 1-55750-984-0, p. 48.]&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the British squadron directly led to the critical [[Battle of the Thames]], the rout of British forces by Harrison's army, the death of [[Tecumseh]], and the breakup of his Indian alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skaggs&quot;/&gt; Along with the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]], it was one of only two significant fleet victories of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt;

In fact, Perry was involved in nine battles that led to and followed the Battle of Lake Erie, and they all had a seminal impact. &quot;What is often overlooked when studying Perry is how his physical participation and brilliant strategic leadership influenced the outcomes of all nine Lake Erie military campaign victories:&quot; Capturing [[Fort George, Ontario]] in the [[Battle of Fort George]]; Destroying the British munitions at [[Olde Fort Erie]] (see [[Capture of Fort Erie]]); Rescuing five vessels from Black Rock; Building the Erie fleet; Getting the ships over the sandbar; Blocking British supplies for a month prior to battle; Planning the Thames invasion with General Harrison; Winning the Battle of Lake Erie; and Winning the Battle of Thames.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skaggs&quot;/&gt;

===The Battle Flag===
“Don’t Give Up The Ship”, a phrase repeated by Captain James Lawrence during his dying days after being wounded by enemy fire aboard the Chesapeake on June 1st, 1813,  became the battle cry of Oliver Hazard Perry.  Perry learned of Lawrence’s demise upon arrival at Presque Isle and commanded that Lawrence would be honored with the name of a brig, which would simply be called, the Lawrence.  A battle flag would also be needed, and the words of Perry’s good friend Lawrence would be just the battle cry suited for the coming days.  A seamstress by the name of Margaret Foster Steuart, a resident of Erie Pennsylvania, was enlisted to make the battle flag. With the help of her two daughters, three nieces, and a cousin, the flag was ready for Perry within just a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skaggs |first=David Curtis |date=2013 |title=The Battle of Lake Erie and Its Aftermath |url=http://muse.jhu.edu.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/chapter/890518 |location=Ohio |publisher=The Kent State University Press |page=220 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of July, 2009, Perry’s flag, Steuart’s work, and Lawrence’s dying words can still be seen today as the flag has been placed on display at the [[U.S._Naval_Academy_Museum|United States Naval Academy Museum]].

===Perry–Elliott controversy===
[[File:NH&amp;HC43575.jpg|thumb|280px|Mural: ''Battle of Lake Erie, 10 September 1813.'' (1959) by Charles Robert Patterson and Howard B. French, U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland. ''Niagara'' joins the battle. ''Detroit'' and ''Queen Charlotte'' at right.]]
While Nelson had his [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Collingwood]], Perry had his Elliott, and was considerably less well served.  Jesse Elliott, while serving with [[Isaac Chauncey]] at Lake Ontario, was tasked to augment Perry's squadron with 11 officers and 91 men, &quot;and none were sent but the worst.&quot;&lt;ref name=altoff2&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|last=Altoff|first=Gerard T.|authorlink=|title=Deep Water Sailors Shallow Water Soldiers: Manning the United States Fleet on Lake Erie  – 1813|publisher=The Perry Group|edition = |location=[[Put-in-Bay, Ohio|Put-in-Bay, OH]]|year = 1993 | pages= 23–24| isbn = 978-1887794015|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, detailed by Chauncey to command ''Niagara,'' Elliott stated &quot;that if he could have foreseen that he himself should be sent to Lake Erie, his selections would have been different.&quot;&lt;ref name=altoff2/&gt; Elliott then appropriated the &quot;best of the worst&quot; for ''Niagara''; and Perry &quot;in the interest of harmony&quot; accepted the situation, though with growing ill-will.&lt;ref name=altoff2/&gt;

In his initial post-action report, Perry had praised Captain Elliott's role in the American victory at Lake Erie; and as news of the battle spread, Perry and Elliott were both celebrated as national heroes. Soon after, however, several junior officers publicly criticized Elliott's performance during the battle, charging that Elliott allowed ''Lawrence'' to suffer the brunt of the British fire while holding ''Niagara'' back from the fight. [[William Vigneron Taylor]], Perry's [[sailing master]], in a letter to Taylor's wife, put it thus:

The meeting between Elliott and Perry on the deck of ''Niagara'' was terse.  Elliott inquired how the day was going.  Perry replied, &quot;Badly.&quot;  Elliott then volunteered to take Perry's small boat and rally the schooners, and Perry acquiesced.&lt;ref name=altoff/&gt;{{rp|49}} As Perry turned ''Niagara'' into the battle, Elliott was not aboard.  Elliott's rejoinder to history's criticism of inaction was that there had been a lack of effective signaling. Charges were filed but were not officially acted upon. Attempting to restore his honor, Elliott and his supporters began a 30-year campaign that would outlive both men and ultimately leave his reputation in tatters.&lt;ref name=Skaggs/&gt;

In Perry's report to Secretary of the Navy [[William Jones (statesman)|William Jones]], written three days after the battle, he mentioned Elliott in what, at first, seem to be complimentary terms but, when read carefully, betray his disdain for Elliott.  Perry wrote - ''In this action he evinced his characteristic bravery and judgement; and, since the close of the action, has given me the most able and essential assistance.'' &lt;ref&gt;American State Papers. Naval Affairs. Volume 1. pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliott was also recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal&lt;ref name=Medal/&gt; and the Thanks of Congress for his actions in the Battle of Lake Erie. This recognition would prove to fan the flames of resentment on both sides of the Elliott–Perry controversy.&lt;ref name=Skaggs/&gt;

In recognition of his victory at Lake Erie, in 1813 Perry was elected as an honorary member of the New York [[Society of the Cincinnati]].

==Later commands and controversies==
[[File:OliverHazardPerryEngraving.jpg|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;USN engraved portrait of &lt;br /&gt; Commodore Perry]]

In July 1814, Perry was placed in command of [[USS Java (1815)|USS ''Java'']], a 44-gun frigate which was under construction in [[Baltimore]]. While overseeing the outfitting of ''Java'', Perry participated in the defenses of Baltimore and Washington, D.C. during the British invasion of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. In a twist of irony, these land battles would be the last time the career naval officer saw combat. The [[Treaty of Ghent]] was signed before ''Java'' could be put to sea.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt;

For Perry, the post-war years were marred by controversies. In 1815, he commanded ''Java'' in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] during the [[Second Barbary War]]. While moored in Naples, Perry was provoked into slapping the commander of the ship's Marines, Captain John Heath. The ensuing court-martial found both men guilty but levied only mild reprimands. After the crew returned home, Heath challenged Perry to a pistol [[duel]], which was fought on October 19, 1817, on the same field in [[Weehawken, New Jersey]] where [[Burr–Hamilton duel|Aaron Burr shot and killed Alexander Hamilton]]. Heath fired first and missed. Perry refused to fire, satisfying the Marine's honor.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt;

Perry's return from the Mediterranean also reignited the feud with Elliott. After an exchange of angry letters, Elliott challenged Perry to a duel, which Perry refused.  He instead, on August 8, 1818, filed formal court-martial charges against Elliott.  Perry filed a total of six charges and twenty-one specifications including &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer,&quot; and failure to &quot;do his utmost to take or destroy the vessel of the enemy which it was his duty to encounter.&quot;

Wishing to avoid a scandal between two congressionally decorated naval heroes, [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Smith Thompson]] and [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Monroe]] suppressed the matter by offering Perry a diplomatic mission to [[South America]] in exchange for dropping his charges against Elliott. This put an official end to the controversy, though it would continue to be debated for another quarter century.&lt;ref name=Skaggs2&gt;{{cite book|title=Oliver Hazard Perry: Honor, Courage, and Patriotism in the Early U.S. Navy|first1=David Curtis |last1=Skaggs|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2006|pages=191–199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAA05BcoIkgC&amp;pg=PR6 |accessdate=September 3, 2011|isbn=978-1-59114-792-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819, aboard of the [[frigate]] {{USS|John Adams|1799|2}} with frigate {{USS|Constellation|1797|2}} and schooner {{USS|Nonsuch|1813|6}}, sailed in a squadron for the [[Orinoco River]], [[Venezuela]], arriving 15 July to discourage piracy while still maintaining friendly relations with [[Republic of Venezuela]] and the [[United Provinces of South America|Republic of Buenos Aires]]. Shifting his flag to USS ''Nonsuch'', Perry sailed upriver to [[Ciudad Bolívar|Angostura]] to negotiate an anti-piracy agreement with President [[Simón Bolívar]]. A favorable treaty was signed on 11 August with the vice-president [[Francisco Antonio Zea]] in the absence of Bolivar (who was engaged in the liberation of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]]); but when the schooner started downriver, many of her crew including Perry had been stricken with [[yellow fever]]. Despite the crew's efforts to reach [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]] for medical assistance, the Commodore died on his 34th birthday as the ship was nearing [[Port of Spain]]. Commodore Perry died on board the USS ''John Adams'' shortly after its arrival at [[Gulf of Paria]] on 23 August. He was buried in [[Port of Spain]] with great honors while ''USS Nonsuch''{{'}}s crew acted as [[honor guard]].

==Family==
[[File:COMMODORE OLIVER PERRY FARM, WASHINGTON COUNTY RI.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|[[Commodore Oliver Perry Farm]] in Rhode Island]]
Perry's parents were [[Christopher Raymond Perry]] (1761–1818), who was also born in South Kingston, RI, and Sarah Wallace Alexander (1763-1830).  Through his mother, Perry was a direct descendant of the uncle of Scottish nobleman [[William Wallace]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cyclopaedia&quot;&gt;[[#White|White, 1895]], p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; (d. 1305), whose life was the inspiration for the movie [[Braveheart]].

Perry married Elizabeth Champlin Mason in 1811.  They had five children, four of whom lived to maturity.  They were:

# Christopher Grant Champlin Perry (April 2, 1812 – April 5, 1854) m. Murial Frances Sergeant of Philadelphia (great-granddaughter of Benjamin Franklin); their daughter Margaret Mason Perry married the artist [[John LaFarge]];
# Oliver Hazard Perry II (February 23, 1813 – March 4, 1814) died in infancy;
# Oliver Hazard Perry, Jr. (February 23, 1815 – August 20, 1878) m. 1) Elizabeth Ann Randolph (1816–1847) (Virginia Randolph family) and m. 2) Mary Ann Moseley;
# Christopher Raymond Perry (June 29, 1816 – October 8, 1848) never married;
# Elizabeth Mason Perry m., as his 2nd wife, the Reverend Francis Vinton, rector of Trinity Episcopal Church in Newport.

Perry's son Christopher Grant Champlin Perry served as commander of the [[Artillery Company of Newport]] from 1848 until his death in 1854.

Oliver Hazard Perry, Jr. entered the Navy as a midshipman in 1829, rose to the rank of lieutenant and resigned in 1849.

Christopher Raymond Perry graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1842.  He served during the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]] and fought at the Battle of Palo Alto on May 8, 1846 and at the Battle of Resaca-de‑la‑Palma on May 9, 1846.  He died on active duty as a 1st lieutenant in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher R.

Perry's nephew by marriage, [[George Champlin Mason, Sr.]], was a noted architect and historian.

[[Oliver Hazard Perry La Farge]] (December 19, 1901 – August 2, 1963) was an American writer and anthropologist, best known for his 1930 [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning novel ''[[Laughing Boy (novel)|Laughing Boy]]''.

His great nephew [[Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont]] (November 12, 1858 – June 10, 1908) was an American socialite and United States Representative from New York.

[[Oliver Hazard Perry Throck Morton]] (August 4, 1823 – November 1, 1877) (no relation)—the 14th [[Governor of Indiana]], a famous [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], who was a leader among the [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]] [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]]ists—was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbZ8rS-84gC |title=Biographical and Historical Sketches of Early Indiana |last1=Woollen |first1=William Wesley |publisher=Ayer Publishing |year=1975 |page=129 |isbn=0-405-06896-4 |accessdate=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
