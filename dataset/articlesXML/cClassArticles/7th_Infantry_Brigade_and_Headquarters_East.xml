The '''7th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters East''' is a formation in the [[British Army]] with a direct lineage to [[7th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Brigade]] and a history that stretches back to the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It saw active service in the [[Crimean War]], the [[Second Boer War]] and both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In 2014, the 7th Armoured Brigade was re-designated as 7th Infantry Brigade, thereby ensuring that the famed &quot;Desert Rats&quot; continue in the British Army's [[Order of battle]].

==History==
===Waterloo Campaign===
When [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] organized his troops into numbered [[Division (military)|divisions]] for the [[Peninsular War]], the component brigades were named for the commanding officer.{{efn|This could be a source of confusion as brigades acquired new commanders, or they moved between brigades, or indeed if two officers with the same surname commanded brigades simultaneously, for example [[Henry Frederick Campbell|Campbell]]'s Brigade of [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Division]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2004|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir Alexander Campbell, 1st Baronet|Campbell]]'s Brigade of [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2004|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 18 June 1809.}}  For the [[Hundred Days|Hundred Days Campaign]], he numbered his British infantry brigades in a single sequence, 1st to 10th.  The 7th Brigade formed part of the [[7th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|7th Division]] under the command of [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-general]] Kenneth MacKenzie. It consisted of:
* 2nd Battalion, [[25th Foot|25th (the King's Own Borderers) Regiment of Foot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/inf/025KOSB.htm |title=The King's Own Scottish Borderers by T.F.

It was assigned to garrison duty and so played no part in the [[Battle of Waterloo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717034259/www.napoleonic-literature.com/Waterloo_OB/Allied.htm |date=17 July 2012 |title=The Anglo-Allied Army at napoleonic-literature.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/British_Order_of_Battle_WATERLOO.html | title=Wellington's Army in 1815 | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crimean War===
The 7th Brigade formed part of the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)#Formation During The Crimean War|4th Division]] in the [[Crimean War]].  At the [[Battle of the Alma]] it was commanded by [[Brigadier-General]] Arthur Wellesley Torrens and consisted of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britishbattles.com/crimean-war/alma.htm | title=The Crimean War - The Battle of The Alma | publisher=britishbattles.com | accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brigade was present with the 4th Division at the [[Battle of Balaclava]] and played a more major role at the [[Battle of Inkerman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Torrens,_Arthur_Wellesley_(DNB00) | title=Torrens, Arthur Wellesley (DNB00) in the Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900 | volume=57 Tom - Tytler | accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Boer War===
After the [[Relief of Ladysmith]], part of the [[Siege of Ladysmith|garrison of Ladysmith]] were reorganized into the 7th Brigade on 10 March 1900.  It consisted of
* 1st Battalion, [[Devonshire Regiment]]
* 1st Battalion, [[Manchester Regiment]]
* 2nd Battalion, [[Gordon Highlanders]]
* 2nd Battalion, [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]]
Initially commanded by [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] W.G. Knox {{postnom|CB}}, it was taken over by [[Brigadier general (United Kingdom)|Brigadier-General]] [[Walter Kitchener]] on 26 March.  The brigade formed part of [[Neville Lyttelton|Lyttelton's]] [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]] and took part in [[Redvers Buller|Sir Redvers Buller's]] advance north.  In August 1900, it took part in the [[Battle of Bergendal]], the last [[pitched battle|set-piece battle]] of the war.&lt;ref name=Jacson&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.angloboerwar.com/books/38-jacson-record-of-the-1st-devons/899-jacson-chapter-iii-events-following-the-siege-of-ladysmith-and-the-advance-north-under-sir-redvers-buller-1900 | title=Jacson: Chapter III - Events Following The Siege Of Ladysmith, And The Advance North Under Sir Redvers Buller 1900 | publisher=AngloBoerWar.com | accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war, the brigade was reformed in January 1906 as part of the 4th Division, before joining the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]] in [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]] in 1907.&lt;ref name=Mackie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201900-2011.pdf |title=Senior Army Appointments |page=191 |first=Colin |last=Mackie |date=August 2014 |accessdate=24 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705211343/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201900-2011.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
At the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914, the 7th Brigade was a [[regular army]] formation stationed at [[Tidworth Camp|Tidworth]] and assigned to the 3rd Division.&lt;ref name=Conrad&gt;{{cite web | url=http://marksrussianmilitaryhistory.info/BRIT14.html | title=The British Army, 1914 | last=Conrad | first=Mark | year=1996 | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It mobilized with the division, crossed to France between 11 and 16 August, concentrated around [[Aulnoye-Aymeries|Aulnoye]] and [[Avesnes]], and moved forward on 21 August 1914.  Other than a brief period when it was reorganized in England in 1918,&lt;ref name=Becke142&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1938|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; the brigade served with the 3rd and [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th Divisions]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] throughout the war.&lt;ref name=Becke54&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Becke139&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1938|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====3rd Division====
With the 3rd Division, the brigade took part in a large number of actions in 1914: the [[Battle of Mons]] (23 and 24 August) and [[Great Retreat|subsequent retreat]] (24 August – 5 September) including the [[Action of Solesmes]] and the [[Battle of Le Cateau]].  It then took part in the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (6 – 9 September) and the [[Race to the Sea]]: [[First Battle of the Aisne]] (13 – 20 September), and the battles of [[Battle of La Bassée|La Bassée]] (10 October – 2 November), [[Battle of Messines (1914)|Messines]] (31 October – 2 November), [[Battle of Armentières|Armentières]] (1 and 2 November) culminating in the [[First Battle of Ypres]] (5 – 21 November), notably the [[Battle of Nonne Bosschen]] (11 November).  1915 was relatively quieter, but included the [[Second Battle of Artois#First Attack on Bellewaarde|First Attack on Bellewaarde]] (16 June), [[Hooge, Belgium|Hooge]] (19 July) and the [[Second Attack on Bellewaarde]] (25 September).&lt;ref name=Becke54/&gt;

While with the 3rd Division, the brigade commanded&lt;ref name=Becke52&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 3rd Battalion, [[Worcestershire Regiment]]
* 2nd Battalion, [[South Lancashire Regiment]]
* 1st Battalion, [[Wiltshire Regiment]]
* 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Rifles]]
* 1/1st Battalion, [[Honourable Artillery Company]] ([[Territorial Force|T.F.]]) ''– joined from [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Brigade]] on 9 December 1914; left for GHQ Troops on 14 October 1915''
* 1/4th Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment (T.F.) ''– joined on 24 February 1915 and became divisional [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]] battalion on 12 October 1915''

====25th Division====
On 18 October 1915, 7th Brigade was posted to the 25th Division in exchange for [[76th Brigade (United Kingdom)|76th Brigade]] as part of a policy of &quot;stiffening&quot; [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] Divisions with regular units.&lt;ref name=Becke53&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once there, it was extensively reorganized on 26 October:&lt;ref name=Becke139/&gt;
* 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles transferred to [[74th Brigade (United Kingdom)|74th Brigade]] in exchange for 10th ([[Kitchener's Army|Service]]) Battalion, [[Cheshire Regiment]]
* 2nd Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment transferred to [[75th Brigade (United Kingdom)|75th Brigade]] in exchange for 8th (Service) Battalion, [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]
On 12 January 1916, the brigade formed the 7th Machine Gun [[Company (military unit)|Company]] and was joined by the 7th [[Mortar (weapon)|Trench Mortar]] [[Artillery battery|Battery]] on 18 June 1916.&lt;ref name=Becke139/&gt;

The brigade saw action in 1916 defending against the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge#Background|German attack on the Vimy Ridge]] (21 May) but particularly in the [[Battle of the Somme]], including the battles of [[Battle of Albert (1916)|Albert]] (3 – 13 July), [[Battle of Bazentin Ridge|Bazentin Ridge]] (14 – 16 July), [[Battle of Pozières|Pozières Ridge]] (18 August – 3 September including the fighting for Mouquet Farm on 3 September) and [[Battle of the Ancre Heights|Ancre Heights]] (1 – 22 October including the capture of the Stuff Redoubt and the Regina Trench).  In 1917 it saw action at the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] (7 – 14 June) and the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] (31 July – 10 August).&lt;ref name=Becke141&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1938|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 13 October 1917, 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion, [[South Staffordshire Regiment]]{{efn|The 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion, [[South Staffordshire Regiment]] was originally the ''2nd Battalion, The King's Own (1st Staffordshire) Militia'', transferred to the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]] (S.R.) by [[Haldane Reforms|Haldane]]'s [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907|military reforms]] on 2 August 1908.  (The ''1st Battalion, The King's Own (1st Staffordshire) Militia'' became the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment at the same time.)&lt;ref name=Frederick309&gt;{{harvnb|Frederick|1984|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Special Reserve battalions were intended to train replacements and provide drafts to the regular (1st and 2nd) battalions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.1914-1918.net/sstaffs.htm | title=The South Staffordshire Regiment | publisher=The Long, Long Trail | first=Chris | last=Baker | accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just four of 101 S.R. battalions were posted to active fronts: the 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalions of the [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)]],&lt;ref name=James51&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bedfordshire Regiment]],&lt;ref name=James59&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; the South Staffordshire Regiment&lt;ref name=James80&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[North Staffordshire Regiment]].&lt;ref name=James98&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} joined the brigade&lt;ref name=Becke140&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1938|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 10 November the 3rd Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment transferred to 74th Brigade.&lt;ref name=Becke139/&gt;

On 1 March, the 7th Machine Gun Company joined the 74th, 75th and (divisional) 195th Machine Gun Companies in the 25th Battalion, [[Machine Gun Corps]].&lt;ref name=Becke140/&gt;  Due to a shortage of manpower, all British{{efn|As distinct from the Australian, Canadian and the New Zealand divisions which remained on a 12-battalion basis.}} divisions on the Western Front were reduced from a 12-battalion to a 9-battalion basis in February 1918.  As a consequence, 7th Brigade was reduced from four to three battalions.&lt;ref name=Becke139/&gt;{{efn|On 16 February 1918, 8th Loyals was disbanded with 21 [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and 480 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]] drafted to 2/4th and 1/5th Loyals in [[170th (2/1st North Lancashire) Brigade]], [[57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division]], and the remainder absorbed by the 5th Entrenching Battalion.&lt;ref name=Becke139/&gt;}}  Almost immediately, the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s [[Spring Offensive]] fell upon the division.  The 25th Division was remarkably unlucky; having faced the first German onslaught at the [[Operation Michael|First Battles of the Somme]] (21 – 25 March), it was moved north to refit, where it faced the second offensive in the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battles of the Lys]] (9 – 29 April).  It was once again moved south to a quite part of the line where it was attacked for the third time in the [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Battle of the Aisne]] (27 May – 6 June).&lt;ref name=Becke142/&gt;

Due to losses sustained, the division was withdrawn from the line and the brigades were reduced to [[En cadre|cadre]].  The divisional and brigade [[Headquarters#Military|HQs]] returned to England with 10th Cheshires and 10 other [[En cadre|Training Cadre]] (T.C.) battalions, arriving on 30 June.&lt;ref name=Becke142/&gt;  For the 7th Brigade this meant:&lt;ref name=Becke140/&gt;
* 10th (Service) Battalion, Cheshire Regiment was reduced to Training Cadre on 21 June{{efn|10th Cheshires provided 10 officers and 353 other ranks to 9th Cheshires in [[56th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|56th Brigade]], [[19th (Western) Division]].&lt;ref name=Becke140/&gt;}} and went to England with the brigade
* 4th (E.R.) Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment joined No. 1 Battalion, Composite Brigade on 21 June and transferred with it to [[50th (Northumbrian) Division]] the next day{{efn|25th Division formed a Composite Brigade on 21 and 22 June 1918 with 4th South Staffs and 11th [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] (as No. 1 Battalion), 8th [[Border Regiment]] and 9th [[Loyal North Lancashire Regiment|Loyals]] (as No. 2 Battalion) and 6th Cheshires (as No 3 Battalion).&lt;ref name=Becke137&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1938|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* 1st Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment transferred to [[110th Brigade (United Kingdom)|110th Brigade]], [[21st Division (United Kingdom)|21st Division]] on 20 June
* 7th Trench Mortar Battery was broken up on 18 June and the personnel helped to form a Light T.M. Battery for the Composite Brigade
* 8th (Service) Battalion, [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|Leicestershire Regiment]] joined as a T.C. from 110th Brigade, 21st Division at [[Boulogne]] on 30 June and went to England with the brigade

===Second World War===
The brigade continued in existence throughout the [[interwar period]], seeing numerous changes in its composition and eventually, in the late 1930s, leading to it being redesignated '''7th Infantry Brigade (Guards)'''. At the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in September 1939, the 7th Infantry Brigade (Guards){{efn|The &quot;Guards&quot; subtitle was applied as all three constituent battlions were drawn from the [[Foot Guards#British Army|Guards]] regiments.}} was, once again, assigned to the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]], commanded at the time by [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]], in [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]]. It was stationed at [[Army Training Centre, Pirbright|Pirbright]] with the following units under command:

* 1st Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]]
* 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards
* 1st Battalion, [[Coldstream Guards]] ''(at [[Chelsea Barracks]], London)''
* 7th Infantry Brigade (Guards) Anti-Tank Company&lt;ref name=PF_SC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.patriotfiles.com/index.php?name=Sections&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=6694&amp;page=1 | title=British Southern Command on 3 September 1939 | publisher=The Patriot Files | accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brigade moved to [[Western Front (World War II)|France]] with the rest of the 3rd Division on 30 September 1939 as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) and remained there, serving alongside the [[French Army]], until May 1940. It first saw action against the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]'s offensive in [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Battle of France|France]], notably on the [[Battle of the Ypres-Comines Canal|Ypres-Comines Canal]] (26 – 28 May 1940) before being [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk]] to the United Kingdom by 1 June.&lt;ref name=Joslen243&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September 1941, it was converted to the [[Guards Support Group]].&lt;ref name=Joslen214&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 1944, it was reorganised as a reserve brigade whereupon it was redesignated as the '''7th Infantry (Reserve) Brigade'''. The brigade remained in the United Kingdom throughout. By the end of the war, the brigade structure was:&lt;ref name=Joslen286/&gt;
