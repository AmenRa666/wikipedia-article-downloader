The '''''U-1'' class''' was a [[ship class|class]] of two [[submarine]]s or [[U-boats]] built for and operated by the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine ''or'' K.u.K. Kriegsmarine}}). The ''U-1''-class boats were built to an American design at the navy yard in [[Pula|Pola]]. The class was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's efforts to competitively evaluate three foreign submarine designs.

The two ''U-1''-class boats, both launched in 1909, were {{convert|100|ft|m}} long and as built were each powered by two [[gasoline engine]]s while surfaced, and two [[electric motor]]s when submerged. Neither boat was operational at the beginning of [[World War I]] because both were in drydock awaiting replacement [[diesel engine]]s for their problematic gasoline engines.

Beginning in 1915, both boats conducted reconnaissance cruises out of either [[Trieste]] or Pola until declared obsolete in early 1918. Both remained in service as a training boats at the submarine base on [[Brioni Island|Brioni]], but each was at Pola at the end of the war. They were ceded to Italy as [[war reparations]] in 1920 and scrapped at Pola. Neither submarine sank any ships during the war.

== Design and construction ==
In 1904, after allowing the navies of other countries to pioneer submarine developments, the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ordered the Austrian Naval Technical Committee (MTK) to produce a submarine design. The January 1905 design developed by the MTK and other designs submitted by the public as part of a design competition were all rejected by the Navy as impracticable. They instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by [[Simon Lake]], [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]], and [[John Philip Holland]] for a competitive evaluation. The two Lake-designed submarines comprised the ''U-1'' class.&lt;ref name=Con-340&gt;Gardiner, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Germaniawerft design became the [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3''-class]] while the Holland design became the [[U-5 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-5'' class]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy ordered plans for the building of two boats—designated ''U-1'' and ''U-2''—from the [[Lake Torpedo Boat Company]] of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], in 1906.&lt;ref name=Gib-383&gt;Gibson and Prendergast, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''U-1''-class design had several features typical of Lake's designs, including a diving chamber under the bow and two variable pitch [[screw propeller|propellers]]. Lake's design also called for two retractable wheels that, in theory, could allow travel over the [[seabed]]. The design also placed the [[diving tank]]s above the waterline of the single, cylindrical [[submarine hull|hull]], which necessitated a heavy [[keel|ballast keel]] for vertical stability. The propulsion system for the ''U-1'' class consisted of two [[gasoline engine]]s for surface running and two [[electric motor]]s for running while submerged.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; For underwater steering and maneuverability, the design featured four pairs of [[diving plane]]s.&lt;ref name=Sieche-16&gt;Sieche, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were {{convert|100|ft|m|0}} long by {{convert|15|ft|9|in|m}} [[beam (ship)|abeam]] and had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|8|in|m}}. As designed, each boat [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|229.7|MT|LT}} surfaced and {{convert|248.9|MT|LT}} submerged.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; Both of the submarines had three {{convert|45|cm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} torpedo tubes—two in the bow, one in the stern—and could carry up to five torpedoes,&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; but typically carried three.&lt;ref name=Gib-383 /&gt; Each submarine was also armed with a {{convert|37|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt;

''U-1'' and ''U-2'' were [[keel laying|laid down]] in July 1907 at the navy yard at [[Pula|Pola]],&lt;ref name=BS /&gt; and were [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in February and April 1909, respectively.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In their book ''The German Submarine War, 1914–1918'', R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast report that ''U-1'' was launched in 1911 and ''U-2'' in 1910 (p. 383).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service career ==
Upon completion of the two boats, the Austro-Hungarian Navy evaluated the ''U-1'' class in trials through 1910. During the trials, technical problems with the gasoline engines were revealed. Exhaust fumes and gasoline vapors frequently poisoned the air inside the boats and the engines themselves were not able reach the contracted speed.&lt;!-- source does not identify the speed--&gt;&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; Because of the problems, the Austro-Hungarian Navy considered the engines to be unsuitable for wartime use and paid only for the hulls and armament of the two ''U-1'' boats. While replacement [[diesel engine]]s were ordered from the Austrian firm ''Maschinenfabrik'' Leobersdorf, they agreed to a lease of the gasoline engines at a fee of US$4,544 annually.&lt;ref name=Sieche-16 /&gt;

In order to dive, the diving tanks, located above the waterline, had to be flooded by pumps, which took over 14½ minutes in early tests, but which was later reduced to 8 minutes. The maximum diving depth was set at {{convert|40|m|ft|sp=us}} when the hulls began to show signs of stress at that depth. The four pairs of diving planes gave the boats exceptional underwater handling, and, when the boats were properly trimmed and balanced, the boats could be held within {{convert|20|cm|in|sp=us}} of the desired depth. Other tests proved the underwater wheels to be useless.&lt;ref name=Sieche-16 /&gt; The ''U-1'' class boats outperformed the [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'']] (Germaniawerft) and [[U-5 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-5'']] (Holland) classes in both diving and steering capabilities in the Austro-Hungarian Navy evaluations.&lt;ref name=Con-340 /&gt;

Both boats were officially [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1911—''U-1'' in April, ''U-2'' in June—and served as training boats, each making as many as ten training cruises a month.&lt;ref name=Sieche-18&gt;Sieche, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''U-1'' and ''U-2'' were both in drydock awaiting the installation of their new diesel engines.&lt;ref name=Con-341&gt;Gardiner, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate the new engines, the boats were lengthened by about {{convert|11|in|cm}}. These changes lowered the surface displacement to {{convert|223.0|MT|LT}} but increased the submerged displacement to {{convert|277.5|MT|LT}}.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt;

From 1915, both boats conducted reconnaissance cruises out of either [[Trieste]] or Pola. In January 1918, the boats were declared obsolete, but remained in service as training boats at the submarine base at [[Brioni Island|Brioni]], but at the war's end both boats were in Pola,&lt;ref name=GP-388&gt;Gibson and Prendergast, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, both boats were ceded to Italy as [[war reparations]] and scrapped.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; Neither boat sank any ships during the war.&lt;ref name=KUK-U-1&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = WWI U-boats: U KUK U1 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=KUK+U1 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | accessdate = 14 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KUK-U-2&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = WWI U-boats: U KUK U2 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=KUK+U2 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | accessdate = 14 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
