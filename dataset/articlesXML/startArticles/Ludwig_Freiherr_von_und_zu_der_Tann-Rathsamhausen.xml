'''Ludwig Samson Heinrich Arthur Freiherr von und zu der Tann-Rathsamhausen''' (18 June 1815 – 26 April 1881) was a [[Bavaria]]n general.

==Early life==
Born at [[Darmstadt]], on the day of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], Ludwig von der Tann was a descendant from the old family of [[von der Tann (disambiguation)|von der Tann]], which had branches in [[Bavaria]], the [[Alsace]] and the [[Rhine]] provinces, and attached his mother's name (she being the daughter of an Alsatian nobleman, Freiherr von Rathsamhausen) to his father's in 1868 by licence of the king of Bavaria. [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig I]], the second king of Bavaria, stood sponsor for the child, who received his name and also &quot;Arthur&quot;, in honour of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]. He received a careful education, and in 1827 became a page at the Bavarian court, where a great future was predicted for him. Entering the [[artillery]] in 1833, he was after some years placed on the general staff. He attended the manoeuvres of the Austrian army in Italy under [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] and, in a spirit of adventure, joined a French military expedition operating in [[Algiers]] against the [[Tunisia]]n frontier. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==First Schleswig War==
On his return he became a close personal friend of the Bavarian Crown Prince [[Maximilian II of Bavaria|Maximilian]] (afterwards King Maximilian II). In 1848 he was promoted to major, and in that year he distinguished himself greatly as the leader of a [[Schleswig-Holstein]] light corps in the [[First Schleswig War]] between Denmark and a coalition of German states. At the close of the first campaign he was awarded the [[Order of the Red Eagle]] by the king of [[Prussia]], and his own sovereign awarded him the [[Military Order of Max Joseph]] and promoted him to lieutenant-colonel. In 1849 he served as chief of staff to the [[Bavaria]]n contingent at the front and distinguished himself at the lines of [[Dybbøl]].  He then visited [[Julius Jacob von Haynau|Haynau]]'s headquarters in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|Hungarian War]] before returning to Schleswig-Holstein to serve as [[Karl Wilhelm von Willisen|von Willisen's]] chief of staff in the Idstedt campaign.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Austro-Prussian War==
Then came the threat of war between Prussia and Austria, and von der Tann was recalled to Bavaria. The crisis ended with the [[Punctation of Olmütz|surrender of Olmütz]], and he saw no further active service until 1866, rising in the usual way of promotion to colonel (1851), major-general (1855), and lieutenant-general (1861). In the earlier years of this period he was the ''aide-de-camp'' and constant companion of the king. In the [[Austro-Prussian War|Austro-Prussian War of 1866]] he was chief of staff to [[Prince Karl Theodor of Bavaria]], who commanded the South German contingents. The almost entirely unfavorable outcome of the military operations led to vehement attacks on him in the press, but the unreadiness and ineffectiveness of the troops and the general lack of interest in the war on the part of the soldiers foredoomed the South Germans to failure in any case.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Franco-German War==
He continued to enjoy the favour of the king and was promoted to the rank of general of the infantry (1869), but the bitterness of his disappointment of 1866 never left him. He was grey-haired at forty-two, and his health was impaired. In 1869 von der Tann-Rathsamhausen, as he was now called, was appointed commander of the [[I Royal Bavarian Corps|I. Bavarian Corps]]. This corps he commanded during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870/71, and it was in this war that he secured his reputation as one of the foremost of German soldiers. His gallantry was conspicuous at the battles of [[Battle of Wörth|Wörth]] and [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Sedan]]. Transferred in the autumn to an independent command on the [[Loire]], he conducted the operations against [[Louis d'Aurelle de Paladines|d'Aurelle de Paladines]], at first with marked success, and forced the surrender of [[Orléans]]. He had, however, at [[Battle of Coulmiers|Coulmiers]] to give way before a numerically larger French force; but reinforced, he fought several successful engagements under the [[Frederick Francis II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] near Orléans.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After the end of the war he was reappointed commander-in-chief of the [[I Royal Bavarian Corps|I. Bavarian Corps]], a post which he held until his death in 1881 at [[Meran]]. He received the Grand Cross of the Bavarian Military Order, and from the King of Prussia the first class of the [[Iron Cross]] and the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]''. In 1878 the German emperor named von der Tann honorary colonel of a Prussian infantry regiment, gave him a life pension, and named one of the new [[Strassburg]] forts after him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
