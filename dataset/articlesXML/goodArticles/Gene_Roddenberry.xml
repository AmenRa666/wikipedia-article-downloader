'''Eugene Wesley''' &quot;'''Gene'''&quot; '''Roddenberry''' (August 19, 1921 – October 24, 1991) was an American television [[screenwriter]] and [[TV producer|producer]]. He is best remembered for creating the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'' television series]]. Born in [[El Paso, Texas]], Roddenberry grew up in [[Los Angeles]], where his father was a police officer. Roddenberry flew eighty-nine combat missions in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] during World War II, and worked as a commercial pilot after the war. Later he followed in his father's footsteps and joined the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] where he also began to write scripts for television.

As a [[freelance writer]], Roddenberry wrote scripts for ''[[Highway Patrol (TV series)|Highway Patrol]]'', ''[[Have Gun–Will Travel]]'', and other series, before creating and producing his own television series ''[[The Lieutenant]].'' In 1964, Roddenberry created ''[[Star Trek]]'', which premiered in 1966 and ran for three seasons before being canceled. He then worked on other projects including a string of failed television pilots. The syndication of ''Star Trek'' led to its growing popularity; this in turn resulted in the [[Star Trek (film franchise)|''Star Trek'' feature films]], which Roddenberry continued to produce and consult. In 1987, the sequel series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' began airing on television in [[broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]]; Roddenberry was heavily involved in the initial development of the series, but took a less active role after the first season due to ill health. He continued to consult on the series until his death in 1991.

In 1985, he became the first TV writer with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and he was later inducted by both the [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame|Science Fiction Hall of Fame]] and the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] Hall of Fame. Years after his death, Roddenberry was one of the first humans to have his ashes carried into earth orbit. The popularity of the ''Star Trek'' universe and films has inspired films, books, comic books, video games, and [[Star Trek fan productions|fan films]] set in the ''Star Trek'' universe.

==Early life and career==
{{main article|Early life and career of Gene Roddenberry}}
[[File:Gene Roddenberry 1939.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Gene Roddenberry, during his senior year at high school]]
Roddenberry was born on August 19, 1921 in his parents' rented home in El Paso, Texas, the first child of Eugene Edward Roddenberry and Caroline &quot;Glen&quot; (née Goleman) Roddenberry. The family moved to Los Angeles in 1923 after Gene's father passed the [[Civil Service]] test and was given a police commission there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially [[pulp magazine]]s,&lt;ref name=alexander34&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and was a fan of stories such as ''[[John Carter of Mars]]'', ''[[Tarzan]]'', and the ''[[Skylark (series)|Skylark]]'' series by [[E. E. Smith]].&lt;ref name=alexander37&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry majored in [[police science]] at [[Los Angeles City College]],&lt;ref name=alexander48&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Studio biographies have erroneously credited Roddenberry as taking pre-law at Los Angeles City College, before switching to a major in engineering at the UCLA.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;n&quot;}} where he began dating Eileen-Anita Rexroat and became interested in [[aeronautical engineering]].&lt;ref name=alexander48/&gt; He obtained a [[pilot licensing and certification|pilot's license]] through the [[United States Army Air Corps]]-sponsored [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]].&lt;ref name=alexander49&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; He enlisted with the USAAC on December 18, 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II Army Enlistment Records Transcription|url=http://search.findmypast.com/record?id=usm%2fwwarmyenlist%2f2020307|publisher=[[Findmypast]]|accessdate=April 28, 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married Eileen on June 13, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the USAAC on August 5, 1942, when he was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=alex59&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt;

He was posted to [[Bellows Field]], Oahu, to join the [[394th Bomb Squadron]], [[5th Bombardment Group]], of the [[Thirteenth Air Force]], which flew the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, 1943, while flying out of [[Espiritu Santo]], the plane Roddenberry was piloting overshot the runway by {{convert|500|ft|m}} and impacted trees, crushing the nose, and starting a fire, killing two men.&lt;ref name=alexander82&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; The official report absolved Roddenberry of any responsibility.&lt;ref name=alexander82/&gt; Roddenberry spent the remainder of his military career in the United States,&lt;ref name=alexander83&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; and flew all over the country as a plane crash investigator. He was involved in a further plane crash, this time as a passenger.&lt;ref name=alexander83/&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and the [[Air Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#hamilton2007|Hamilton (2007)]]: p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Roddenberry began flying for [[Pan American World Airways]],&lt;ref name=alex85/&gt; including routes from New York to Johannesburg or Calcutta, the two longest Pan Am routes at the time.&lt;ref name=alex85&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Listed as a resident of [[River Edge, New Jersey]], he experienced his third crash while on the [[Pan Am Flight 121|Clipper ''Eclipse'']] on June 18, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeze|first1=Christopher|title=Clipper Eclipse|url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/ClipperEclipse-NC88845.htm|website=Check-Six.com|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane landed in the Syrian desert, and Roddenberry dragged injured passengers out of the burning plane and led the group to get help.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 91–95&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen people died in the crash; eleven passengers needed hospital treatment, and eight were unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from Pan-Am on May 15, 1948, and decided to pursue his dream of writing, particularly for the new medium of television.&lt;ref name=alex103&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry applied for a position with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] on January 10, 1949,&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; and spent his first sixteen months in the traffic division before being transferred to the newspaper unit.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; This became the &quot;Public Information Division&quot; and Roddenberry became the Chief of Police's speech writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander 1995 p. 115&quot;&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; He became technical advisor for a new television version of ''[[Mr. District Attorney]]'', which led to him writing for the show under his pseudonym &quot;Robert Wesley&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 135–137&lt;/ref&gt; He began to collaborate with [[Ziv Television Programs]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]] p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to sell scripts to ''Mr. District Attorney'', in addition to Ziv's ''[[Highway Patrol (TV series)|Highway Patrol]]''. In early 1956, he sold two story ideas for ''[[I Led Three Lives]]'', and he found that it was becoming increasingly difficult to be a writer as well as a policeman.&lt;ref name=alex148&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, 1956, he resigned from the force to concentrate on his writing career.&lt;ref name=alex151&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as full-time writer and producer==
{{see also|Gene Roddenberry filmography}}

===Early career===
Roddenberry was promoted to head writer for ''[[The West Point Story (TV series)|The West Point Story]]'', and wrote ten scripts for the first season, about a third of the total episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; While working for Ziv, he pitched a series to [[CBS]] set on board a [[cruise ship]], but they did not buy it as he wanted to become a [[Producer (television)|producer]] and have full creative control. He wrote another script for Ziv's series &quot;[[Harbourmaster (TV series)|Harbourmaster]]&quot; titled &quot;Coastal Security&quot;, and signed a contract with the company to develop a show called ''Junior Executive'' with [[Quinn Martin]].  Nothing came of the series.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 162–164&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Leonard Nimoy mid 1960s.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Roddenberry and Leonard Nimoy ''(pictured)'' first worked together on ''The Lieutenant''.]]
He wrote scripts for a number of other series in his early years as a professional writer including ''[[Bat Masterson (TV series)|Bat Masterson]]'' and ''[[Jefferson Drum]]''.&lt;ref name=alex167/&gt; Roddenberry's episode of the series ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'', &quot;Helen of Abajinan&quot;, won the [[Writer's Guild of America]] award for Best Teleplay in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;reginald1052&quot;/&gt; He also continued to create series of his own, including a series based on an agent for [[Lloyd's of London]] called ''The Man from Lloyds''. He pitched a police-based series called ''Footbeat'' to CBS, Hollis Productions and [[Screen Gems]]. It nearly made it into [[ABC (TV station)|ABC]]'s Sunday-night line-up but they opted to show only [[Western (genre)|western genre]] series that night.&lt;ref name=alex167&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry was asked to write a series called ''Riverboat'', set in 1860s Mississippi. When he discovered that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued so much with them that he lost the job.&lt;ref&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He was also considered moving to England around this time, as Sir [[Lew Grade]] of [[Associated Television]] wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Though he did not move, he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed $100,000, and became a producer for the first time on a summer replacement for the ''[[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] Show'' titled ''The Wrangler''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Screen Gems backed Roddenberry's first attempt at creating a pilot. His series, ''The Wild Blue'', went to pilot but was not picked up. The three main characters had names that would later appear in the ''Star Trek'' franchise: Philip Pike, Edward Jellicoe, and James T. Irvine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; While working at Screen Gems an actress, new to Hollywood, wrote to him asking for a meeting. They quickly became friends and would meet every few months; the woman was [[Majel Barrett|Majel Leigh Hudec]], later known as Majel Barrett.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; He created a second pilot called ''333 Montgomery'' about a lawyer, played by [[DeForest Kelley]].&lt;ref name=hise15&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; It was not picked up by the network, but was later re-written as a new series called ''Defiance County''. His career with Screen Gems ended in late 1961&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly afterward he had issues with his old friend [[Erle Stanley Gardner]]. The ''[[Perry Mason]]'' creator claimed that ''Defiance County'' had infringed his character [[Doug Selby]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; The two writers fell out via correspondence and stopped contacting one another, even though ''Defiance County'' never proceeded past the pilot stage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;
[[file:MONY Gene Roddenberry.JPG|thumb|left|Gene Roddenberry appearing in an advertisement for MONY in 1961]]
In 1961, he agreed to appear in an advertisement for [[MONY]] (Mutual of New York), as long as he had final approval.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; With the money from Screen Gems and other works, he and Eileen moved to 539 South Beverly Glen, near [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; He discussed an idea about a multi-ethnic crew on an [[airship]] travelling the world, based on the 1961 film ''[[Master of the World (1961 film)|Master of the World]]'', with fellow writer Christopher Knopf at [[MGM]]. As the time was not right for science fiction, he began work on ''[[The Lieutenant]]'' for Arena Productions. This made it to the [[NBC]] Saturday night line-up at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm,&lt;ref name=alex201/&gt; and premiered on September 14, 1963. The show set a new ratings record for that time slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry worked with several cast and crew who would later join him on ''Star Trek'', including: [[Gene L. Coon]], star [[Gary Lockwood]], Joe D'Agosta, [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Nichelle Nichols]], and Majel Barrett.&lt;ref name=alex201&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lieutenant'' was produced with the co-operation of [[the Pentagon]], which allowed them to film at an actual Marine base. During the production of the series, Roddenberry clashed regularly with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] over potential plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department withdrew its support after Roddenberry pressed ahead with a plot titled &quot;To Set It Right&quot; in which a white and a black man find a common cause in their roles as Marines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nichols122/&gt; &quot;To Set It Right&quot; was the first time he worked with Nichols, and it was her first television role. The episode has been preserved at the [[Museum of Television and Radio]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=nichols122&gt;[[#nichols1994|Nichols (1994)]]: p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The show was not renewed after its first season. Roddenberry was already working on a new series idea. This included his ship location from ''Hawaii Passage'' and added a [[Horatio Hornblower]] character, plus the multi-racial crew from his airship idea. He decided to write it as science fiction, and by March 11, 1964, he brought together a sixteen-page pitch. On April 24, he sent three copies and two dollars to the [[Writers Guild of America]] to register his series. He called it ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref name=alex204&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Star Trek''===
{{main article|Star Trek: The Original Series}}
When Roddenberry pitched ''Star Trek'' to MGM, it was warmly received but no offer was made.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to [[Desilu Productions]], but rather than being offered a one-script deal, he was hired as a producer and allowed to work on his own projects. His first was a half-hour pilot called ''Police Story'' (not to be confused with [[Police Story (film series)|the anthology series]] created by [[Joseph Wambaugh]]), which was not picked up by the networks.&lt;ref name=alex211/&gt; Having not sold a pilot in five years, Desilu was having financial difficulties; its only success was ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.&lt;ref name=vanhise20&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry took the ''Star Trek'' idea to Oscar Katz, head of programming, and the duo immediately started work on a plan to sell the series to the networks. They took it to CBS, which ultimately passed on it. The duo later learned that CBS had been eager to find out about ''Star Trek'' because it had a science fiction series in development—''[[Lost in Space]]''. Roddenberry and Katz next took the idea to Mort Werner at NBC,&lt;ref name=vanhise20/&gt; this time downplaying the science fiction elements and highlighting the links to ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and ''[[Wagon Train]].''&lt;ref name=alex211&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; The network funded three story ideas, and selected &quot;The Menagerie,&quot; which was later known as &quot;[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]],&quot; to be made into a pilot. (The other two later became episodes of the series.) While most of the money for the pilot came from NBC, the remaining costs were covered by Desilu.&lt;ref name=alex213&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry hired Dorothy Fontana, better known as [[D. C. Fontana]], as his assistant. They had worked together previously on ''The Lieutenant,'' and she had eight script credits to her name.&lt;ref name=vanhise20/&gt;
[[File:William Shatner Sally Kellerman Star Trek 1966.JPG|thumb|right|upright|William Shatner and [[Sally Kellerman]], from &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before,&quot; the second pilot of ''Star Trek'']]
Roddenberry and Barrett had begun an affair by the early days of ''Star Trek'',&lt;ref name=alex213/&gt; and he specifically wrote the part of the character [[Number One (Star Trek)|Number One]] in the pilot with her in mind; no other actresses were considered for the role. Barrett suggested Nimoy for the part of [[Spock (Star Trek)|Spock]]. He had worked with both Roddenberry and Barrett on ''The Lieutenant'', and once Roddenberry remembered the thin features of the actor, he did not consider anyone else for the part.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining cast came together; filming began on November 27, 1964, and was completed on December 11.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 234–236&lt;/ref&gt; After post-production, the episode was shown to NBC executives and it was rumored that ''Star Trek'' would be broadcast at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Friday nights. The episode failed to impress test audiences,&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; and after the executives became hesitant, Katz offered to make a second pilot. On March 26, 1965, NBC ordered a new episode.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 243–244&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry developed several possible scripts, including &quot;[[Mudd's Women]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Omega Glory]]&quot;, and with the help of [[Samuel A. Peeples]], &quot;[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]&quot;. NBC selected the last one, leading to later rumors that Peeples created ''Star Trek'', something he has always denied.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 246–248&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry was determined to make the crew racially diverse, which impressed actor [[George Takei]] when he came for his audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Takei|1994|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode went into production on July 15, 1965, and was completed at around half the cost of &quot;The Cage&quot; since the sets were already built.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry worked on several projects for the rest of the year. In December, he decided to write lyrics to the ''Star Trek'' theme; this angered the theme's composer, [[Alexander Courage]], as it meant that royalties would be split between them. In February 1966, NBC informed Desilu that they were buying ''Star Trek'' and that it would be included in the fall 1966 television schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 255–256&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, the first episode of the ''Star Trek'' series went into production;&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Desilu was contracted to deliver thirteen episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; Five days before the first broadcast, Roddenberry appeared at the 24th [[World Science Fiction Convention]] and previewed &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. After the episode was shown, he received a standing ovation. The first episode to air on NBC was &quot;[[The Man Trap]]&quot;, on September 8, 1966, at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry was immediately concerned about the series' low ratings and wrote to [[Harlan Ellison]] to ask if he could use his name in letters to the network to save the show. Not wanting to lose a potential source of income, Ellison agreed and also sought the help of other writers who also wanted to avoid losing potential income.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry corresponded with science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]] about how to address the issue of Spock's growing popularity and the possibility that his character would overshadow Kirk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov suggested having Kirk and Spock work together as a team &quot;to get people to think of Kirk when they think of Spock.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; The series was renewed by NBC, first for a full season's order, and then for a second season. An article in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' quoted studio executives as stating that the letter-writing campaign had been wasted because they had already been planning to renew ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Star Trek crew members.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Some of the main cast of ''Star Trek'' during the third season]]
Roddenberry often rewrote submitted scripts, although he did not always take credit for these.&lt;ref name=alex314&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry and Ellison fell out over &quot;[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]&quot; after Roddenberry rewrote Ellison's script to make it both financially feasible to film and usable for the series context.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; Even his close friend [[Don Ingalls]] had his script for &quot;[[A Private Little War]]&quot; altered drastically,&lt;ref name=alex314/&gt; and, as a result, Ingalls declared that he would only be credited under the pseudonym &quot;Jud Crucis&quot; (a play on &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;), claiming he had been [[crucified]] by the process.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry's work rewriting &quot;[[The Menagerie (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Menagerie]]&quot;, based on footage originally shot for &quot;The Cage&quot;, resulted in a Writers' Guild arbitration board hearing. The Guild ruled in his favor over [[John D. F. Black]], the complainant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script won a [[Hugo Award]], but the awards board neglected to inform Roddenberry, who found out through correspondence with Asimov.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the second season was drawing to a close, Roddenberry once again faced the threat of cancellation. He enlisted the help of Asimov,&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; and even encouraged a student-led protest march on NBC. On January 8, 1968, a thousand students from twenty different schools across the country marched on the studio.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry began to communicate with ''Star Trek'' fan [[Bjo Trimble]], who led a fan writing campaign to save the series. Trimble later noted that this campaign of writing to fans who had written to Desilu about the show, urging them to write NBC, had created an organized [[Star Trek fandom|''Star Trek'' fandom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 336–337&lt;/ref&gt; The network received around 6,000 letters a week from fans petitioning it to renew the series.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 1968, NBC announced on air, at the end of &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;, that ''Star Trek'' would return for a third season.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

The network had initially planned to place ''Star Trek'' in the 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm Monday-night time slot freed up by ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' completing its run. Instead, the enraged [[George Schlatter]] forced the network to insert ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]'' into the slot, and Roddenberry's series was moved to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Fridays. Realizing the show could not survive in that time slot and burned out from arguments with the network, Roddenberry resigned from the day-to-day running of ''Star Trek'', although he continued to be credited as executive producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 342–343&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry cooperated with Stephen Edward Poe, writing as Stephen Whitfield, on the 1968 nonfiction book ''The Making of Star Trek'' for Ballantine Books, splitting the royalties evenly. Roddenberry explained to Whitfield: &quot;I had to get some money somewhere. I'm sure not going to get it from the profits of ''Star Trek''.&quot; &lt;ref name=sojust402&gt;[[#solowjustman1996|Solow &amp; Justman (1996)]]: p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Solow and [[Robert H. Justman]] observed that Whitfield never regretted his fifty-fifty deal with Roddenberry since it gave him &quot;the opportunity to become the first chronicler of television's successful unsuccessful series.&quot;&lt;ref name=sojust402/&gt; Whitfield had previously been the national advertising and promotion director for model makers [[Aluminum Model Toys]], better known as &quot;AMT&quot;, which then held the ''Star Trek'' license, and moved to run [[Lincoln Enterprises]], Roddenberry's company set up to sell the series' merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having stepped aside from the majority of his ''Star Trek'' duties, Roddenberry sought instead to create a film based on Asimov's &quot;[[I, Robot (short story)|I, Robot]]&quot; and also began work on a ''Tarzan'' script for [[National General Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 390–391&lt;/ref&gt; After initially requesting a budget of $2 million and being refused, Roddenberry made cuts to reduce costs to $1.2 million. When he learned they were being offered only $700,000 to shoot the film, which by now was being called a [[TV movie]], he cancelled the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 393–394&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, NBC announced ''Star Trek's'' cancellation in February 1969. A similar but much smaller letter-writing campaign followed news of the cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the manner in which the series was sold to NBC, it left the production company $4.7 million in debt.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; The last episode of ''Star Trek'' aired forty-seven days before [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped onto the moon as part of the [[Apollo 11]] mission,&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; and Roddenberry declared that he would never write for television again.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s projects===
Following the cancellation of ''Star Trek,'' Roddenberry felt [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a producer of science fiction, despite his background in westerns and police stories.&lt;ref&gt;[[#asherman1988|Asherman (1988)]]: p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He later described the period, saying, &quot;My dreams were going downhill because I could not get work after the original series was cancelled.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that he was &quot;perceived as the guy who made the show that was an expensive flop.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schonauer|first1=David|title=What's important is what hasn't changed|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19880422&amp;id=qzwsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hs4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6960,2530069&amp;hl=en|accessdate=April 15, 2015|work=Herald-Journal|issue=113|date=April 22, 1988|volume=58|page=B8|via=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry had sold his interest in ''Star Trek'' to [[Paramount Studios]] in return for a third of the ongoing profits. However, this did not result in any quick financial gain; the studio was still claiming that the series was $500,000 in the red in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote and produced ''[[Pretty Maids All in a Row]]'' (1971), a [[sexploitation]] film directed by [[Roger Vadim]], for MGM. The cast included [[Rock Hudson]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Telly Savalas]], and [[Roddy McDowall]] alongside ''Star Trek'' regular [[James Doohan]], and [[William Campbell (film actor)|William J. Campbell]], who had appeared as a guest in two ''Star Trek'' episodes, &quot;The Squire Of Gothos&quot; and &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles.&quot; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine was unimpressed: &quot;Whatever substance was in the original [novel by Francis Pollini] or screen concept has been plowed under, leaving only superficial, one-joke results.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: 'Pretty Maids All in a Row'|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112054028/http://variety.com/1970/film/reviews/pretty-maids-all-in-a-row-1200422446/|archivedate=January 12, 2015|url=http://variety.com/1970/film/reviews/pretty-maids-all-in-a-row-1200422446/|accessdate=March 25, 2015|work=Variety|date=December 31, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Solow had given Roddenberry the work as a favor, paying him $100,000 for the script.&lt;ref name=&quot;engel139&quot;/&gt;

Faced with a $2,000 per month alimony obligation as a result of his 1969 divorce, and a mortgage, he began to support himself largely by giving college lectures and appearances at science fiction conventions.&lt;ref name=engel140&gt;[[#engel1994|Engel (1994)]]: p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#nemecek2003|Nemecek (2003)]]: p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; These presentations included screenings of &quot;The Cage&quot; and blooper reels from the production of ''Star Trek.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Star Trek' creator brings banned pilot to the Arena Sunday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2295345//|accessdate=April 26, 2015|work=San Antonio Express|date=January 7, 1977|page=4C|subscription=yes|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was paid $25,000 to write a script called ''The Nine,''&lt;ref name=nine/&gt; which was meant to be about paranormal experiences, but ended up being based on his experiences attempting to earn a living attending [[science fiction conventions]].&lt;ref name=hise59&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he was close to losing his house because of the lack of income.&lt;ref name=nine&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conventions began to build the fan support to bring back ''Star Trek,'' leading ''[[TV Guide]]'' to describe it, in 1972, as &quot;the show that won't die.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 and 1973, Roddenberry made a comeback to science fiction, selling ideas for four new series to a variety of networks.&lt;ref name=hise59/&gt; Roddenberry's ''[[Genesis II (film)|Genesis II]]'' was set in a post-apocalyptic Earth. He had hoped to recreate the success of ''Star Trek'' without &quot;doing another space-hopping show.&quot; He created a 45-page writing guide, and proposed several story ideas based on the concept that pockets of civilisation had regressed to past eras or changed altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot aired as a TV movie in March 1973, setting new records for the Thursday Night Movie of the Week. Roddenberry was asked to produce four more scripts for episodes, but before production could begin again, CBS aired the film ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]].'' It was watched by an even greater audience than ''Genesis II.'' CBS scrapped ''Genesis II'' and replaced it with the [[Planet of the Apes (TV series)|''Apes'' television series]];&lt;ref&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; the results were disastrous ratings-wise, and ''Planet Of The Apes'' was quickly canceled.

''[[The Questor Tapes]]'' was a project that reunited him with his ''Star Trek'' collaborator, Gene L. Coon, who was in failing health at the time. NBC ordered sixteen episodes, and tentatively scheduled the series to follow ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' on Friday nights;&lt;ref name=hise65/&gt; the pilot launched on January 23, 1974,&lt;ref&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; to positive critical response. But Roddenberry balked at the substantial changes requested by the network and left the project, leading to its immediate cancellation. During 1974, Roddenberry reworked the ''Genesis II'' concept as a second pilot, ''[[Planet Earth (TV pilot)|Planet Earth]],'' for rival network ABC, with similar less-than-successful results. The pilot was aired on April 23, 1974. While Roddenberry wanted to create something that could feasibly exist in the future, the network wanted stereotypical science fiction women and were unhappy when that was not delivered.&lt;ref name=hise65&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry was not involved in a third reworking of the material by ABC that produced ''[[Strange New World (TV pilot)|Strange New World]].''&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, David, &quot;Star Trek Creator.&quot; ROC Books, an imprint of Dutton Signet, a division of Penguin Books USA, New York, June 1994, ISBN 0-451-45418-9, pp. 398–403.&lt;/ref&gt; He began developing ''MAGNA I,'' an underwater science fiction series, for [[20th Century Fox Television]]. But by the time the work on the script was complete, those who had approved the project had left Fox and their replacements were not interested in the project. A similar fate was faced by ''Tribunes,'' a science fiction police series, which Roddenberry attempted to get off the ground between 1973 and 1977. He gave up after four years;&lt;ref&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; the series never even reached the pilot stage.

===''Star Trek'' revival===
[[File:Space shuttle enterprise star trek-cropcast.jpg|left|thumb|Gene Roddenberry (third from the right) in 1976 with most of the cast of ''Star Trek'' at the rollout of the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']] at the [[Rockwell International]] plant at [[Palmdale, California]]]]
Lacking funds in the early 1970s, Roddenberry was unable to buy the full rights to ''Star Trek'' for $150,000 from Paramount. [[Lou Scheimer]] approached Paramount in 1973 about creating an animated ''Star Trek'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credited as &quot;executive consultant,&quot; and paid $2,500 per episode, Roddenberry was granted full creative control of ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]''. Although he read all the scripts and &quot;sometimes [added] touches of his own&quot;, he relinquished most of his authority to ''de facto'' showrunner/associate producer D. C. Fontana.&lt;ref&gt;[[#clark2012|Clark (2012)]]: p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry had some difficulties with the cast. To save money, he sought not to hire George Takei and Nichelle Nichols. He neglected to inform Leonard Nimoy of this and instead, in an effort to get him to sign on, told him that he was the only member of the main cast not returning. After Nimoy discovered the deception, he demanded that Takei and Nichols play Sulu and Uhura when their characters appeared on screen. Roddenberry acquiesced. He had been promised five full seasons of the new show, but ultimately, only one and a half were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the groundswell of vociferous fan support (6,000 attended the second New York ''Star Trek'' convention in 1973 and 15,000 attended in 1974, much larger figures than at older events like the 4,500 at the [[32nd World Science Fiction Convention]] in 1974) led Paramount to hire Roddenberry to create and produce a feature film based on the franchise in May 1975.&lt;ref name=reevesphase16&gt;[[#Reeves-Stevens1997|Reeves-Stevens &amp; Reeves-Stevens (1997)]]: p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Conventions&lt;/ref&gt; The studio was unimpressed with the ideas being put forward; John D. F. Black's opinion was that their ideas were never &quot;big enough&quot; for the studio, even when one scenario involved the end of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, several ideas were partly developed including ''[[Star Trek: The God Thing]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Planet of the Titans]]''.&lt;ref name=starlog2p13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reeves-Stevens1997|Reeves-Stevens &amp; Reeves-Stevens (1997)]]: p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Following the commercial reception of ''[[Star Wars]]'', in June 1977, Paramount instead green-lit a new series set in the franchise titled ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'',&lt;ref name=engel180/&gt; with Roddenberry and most of the original cast, except Nimoy, set to reprise their respective roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be the anchor show of a proposed Paramount-owned &quot;fourth network&quot;,&lt;ref name=engel180&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; but plans for the network were scrapped and the project was reworked into a feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result, ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', troubled the studio because of budgetary concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was a box office hit. Adjusted for [[inflation]], it was the third highest grossing ''Star Trek'' movie, with the [[Star Trek (film)|2009 film]] coming in first and the [[Star Trek: Into Darkness|2013 film]] second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Star Trek Movies at the Box Office| work = Box Office Mojo| url =http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=startrek.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101041641/http://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=startrek.htm|archivedate=January 1, 2015|accessdate = April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Roddenberry submitted a treatment for a proposed sequel about the crew preventing the alien [[Klingon]]s from thwarting the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]]. Paramount rejected it and he was replaced on the project by television producer [[Harve Bennett]]. Roddenberry was named executive consultant for the project, and was compensated with a producer's fee and a percentage of the net profits of any film projects in exchange for proffering non-binding story notes and corresponding with the fan community. Although Roddenberry's memos were largely disregarded by Bennett and other producers, this arrangement persisted on future installments of the film series for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greenberger|2012|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial script for ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' was circulated to eight people; Bennett attributed the subsequent plot leak of the death of Spock to Roddenberry. Twenty percent of the plot was based on Roddenberry's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greenberger|2012|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry was involved in creating the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', which premiered with &quot;[[Encounter at Farpoint]]&quot; on September 28, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encounter at Farpoint, Part I|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/encounter-at-farpoint-part-i|publisher=StarTrek.com|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given a bonus of $1 million in addition to an ongoing salary to produce the series, and celebrated by purchasing a new [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] for $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not entitle him to be executive producer of the series. However, Paramount was already concerned about the original cast not returning, and fearing fan reaction if Roddenberry was not involved, agreed to his demand for control of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry rewrote the [[Bible (screenwriting)|series bible]] from an original version by [[David Gerrold]], who had previously written ''The Original Series'' episode &quot;[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]&quot;, and ''The Animated Series'' follow-up, &quot;[[More Tribbles, More Troubles]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vinciguerra|first=Thomas|title=Nobody Knows the Tribbles He's Seen|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/arts/television/16vinc.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415111244/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/arts/television/16vinc.html?_r=0|archivedate=April 15, 2015|accessdate=April 15, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Majel Barrett in 2006 cropped.png|thumb|right|upright|Majel Barrett at a ''Star Trek'' convention in 2007]]
According to producer [[Rick Berman]], &quot;Gene's hands-on involvement in ''The Next Generation'' diminished greatly after the first season&quot;,&lt;ref name=tulock186/&gt; but the nature of his increasingly peripheral role was not disclosed because of the value of his name to fans.&lt;ref name=tulock186&gt;[[#tulockjenkins1995|Tulock &amp; Jenkins (1995)]]: p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; While Berman said that Roddenberry had &quot;all but stopped writing and rewriting&quot; by the end of the third season, his final writing credit on the show (a co-teleplay credit) was on &quot;[[Datalore]]&quot;, the thirteenth episode of the first season.

Although commercially successful from its inception, the series was initially marred by Writers Guild of America grievance claims from long time franchise writers Fontana and David Gerrold, both of whom left the series under acrimonious circumstances;&lt;ref name=engel238/&gt; frequent turnover among the writing staff (twenty-four staff writers left the show during its first three seasons, triple the average attrition rate for such series);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allegations that Roddenberry's attorney Leonard Maizlish had become the former's &quot;point man and proxy&quot;,&lt;ref name=engel238/&gt; ghostwriting memos, sitting in on meetings, and contributing to scripts despite not being on staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Tracy Tormé]] described the first few seasons of ''The Next Generation'' under Roddenberry as an &quot;insane asylum&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Engel 1994 p. 247&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Nicholas Meyer]] was brought in to direct the sixth film in the series: ''[[Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country]]''. He and Roddenberry clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the ''Enterprise'' crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer described a meeting he later regretted with Roddenberry, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;His guys were lined up on one side of the room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Noelene|title='Star Trek': Nicholas Meyer explains his Roddenberry regret|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/star-trek-nicholas-meyers-explains-his-roddenberry-regret/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103102322/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/star-trek-nicholas-meyers-explains-his-roddenberry-regret/|archivedate=January 3, 2015|accessdate=March 28, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Roddenberry watched ''The Undiscovered Country'' alongside the producers of the film, at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a &quot;good job&quot;.&lt;ref name=engel259&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his film and television work, Roddenberry wrote the novelization of ''Star Trek: The Motion Picture'', although it has been attributed to several other authors. It was the first in a series of hundreds of ''Star Trek''-based novels to be published by the Pocket Books [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], whose parent company also owned [[Paramount Pictures Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ayers2006|Ayers (2006)]]: p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Roddenberry worked intermittently on a novel ''The God Thing'' that he had based upon his rejected 1975 screenplay for a proposed low-budget ($3 to $5 million) ''Star Trek'' film preceding the development of ''Phase II'' throughout 1976.

==Personal life==
{{main article|Personal life of Gene Roddenberry}}
[[File:Rod and Majel Roddenberry Star Trek Convention Las Vegas 20080814.jpg|thumb|right|Majel Barrett-Roddenberry and Rod Roddenberry in 2008]]
While at Los Angeles City College, Roddenberry began dating Eileen-Anita Rexroat.&lt;ref name=alexander48/&gt; They became engaged before Roddenberry left Los Angeles during his military service,&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; and married in June 1942 at the chapel at Kelly Field.&lt;ref name=alex59/&gt; They had two children together, Darleen Anita,&lt;ref name=alex103/&gt; and Dawn Allison.&lt;ref name=alex163&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in the LAPD, Roddenberry was known to have had affairs with secretarial staff.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Before his work on ''Star Trek'', he began relationships with both Nichelle Nichols and Majel Barrett.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sterling|first1=Ian|title=Uhura and Beyond|journal=Starlog|date=January 1995|issue=210|pages=47–49|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-210/210#page/n47/mode/1up|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols only wrote about their relationship in her autobiography ''Beyond Uhura'' after Roddenberry's death.&lt;ref name=nichols130&gt;[[#nichols1994|Nichols (1994)]]: p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Roddenberry wanted to remain in an open relationship with both women,&lt;ref&gt;[[#nichols1994|Nichols (1994)]]: p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; but Nichols, recognising Barrett's devotion to him, ended the affair as she did not want to be &quot;the other woman to the other woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#nichols1994|Nichols (1994)]]: p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

He and Barrett had an apartment together by the opening weeks of ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#engel1994|Engel (1994)]]: p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; He had planned to divorce Eileen after the first season of the show, but when it was renewed, he delayed doing so fearing that he would not have enough time to deal with both the divorce and ''Star Trek''. He moved out of the family home on August 9, 1968, two weeks after the marriage of his daughter Darleen.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: pp. 352–353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, while scouting locations in Japan for MGM for ''Pretty Maids all in a Row'',&lt;ref name=engel139&gt;[[#engel1994|Engel (1994)]]: p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; he proposed to Barrett by telephone.&lt;ref name=hise53/&gt; They were married in a [[Shinto]] ceremony as Roddenberry had considered it &quot;sacrilegious&quot; to use an American minister in Japan.&lt;ref name=hise53/&gt; Roddenberry and Barrett had a son together, Eugene Jr., commonly referred to as [[Rod Roddenberry]], in February 1974.&lt;ref name=hise53&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious views===
Roddenberry was raised a [[Southern Baptist]];&lt;ref name=hise7&gt;[[#vanhise1992|Van Hise (1992)]]: p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; however, as an adult Roddenberry rejected religion, and considered himself a [[humanism|humanist]].&lt;ref name=alex167 /&gt; He began questioning religion around the age of fourteen, and came to the conclusion that it was &quot;nonsense&quot;.&lt;ref name=hise7/&gt; As a child, he served in the [[choir]] at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns.&lt;ref name=hise7/&gt; Early in his writing career, he received an award from the [[American Baptist Convention]] for &quot;skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts&quot;.&lt;ref name=alex167 /&gt; For several years he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the [[National Council of Churches]] regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: &quot;But you must understand that I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry said of [[Christianity]], &quot;How can I take seriously a god-image that requires that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That sounds to me like a very insecure personality.&quot;&lt;ref name=hise7/&gt; At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which was to have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for ''Star Trek: The God Thing''.&lt;ref name=starlog2p13&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Jim|title=The Star Trek movie|journal=Starlog|issue=2|page=13|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-002/002#page/n12/mode/1up|date=November 1976|accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher [[Charles Musès]], who said that Roddenberry's views were &quot;a far cry from [[atheism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#fern1994|Fern (1994)]]: p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry explained his position thusly: &quot;It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of god. It's just not other people's god. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#fern1994|Fern (1994)]]: p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion,&lt;ref&gt;[[#fern1994|Fern (1994)]]: p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and called [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] &quot;a very beautiful religion. An art form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#fern1994|Fern (1994)]]: p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; However, he said that he dismissed all [[organized religion]]s, saying that for the most part, they acted like a &quot;substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#fern1994|Fern (1994)]]: p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the [[King David Hotel bombing]] took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a [[Muslim]] in [[Beirut]] is condemned as a [[terrorist]] act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#asherman1988|Asherman (1988)]]: p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ronald D. Moore]], Roddenberry &quot;felt very strongly that contemporary Earth religions would be gone by the 23rd century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Memory_Alpha:AOL_chats/Ronald_D._Moore/ron012.txt|accessdate=20 January 2014|author=Ronald D. Moore|title=AOL chats Ronald D. Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brannon Braga]] said that Roddenberry made it known to the writers of ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' that religion, superstition, and mystical thinking were not to be included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Braga | first = Brannon | title = Every religion has a mythology | booktitle = International Atheist Conference | place = Reykjavik, Iceland | date = June 24, 2006 | url =http://sidmennt.is/2006/08/16/every-religion-has-a-mythology/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212061150/http://sidmennt.is/2006/08/16/every-religion-has-a-mythology/|archivedate=February 12, 2014 | accessdate = May 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even a mention of marriage in a script for an early episode of ''The Next Generation'' resulted in Roddenberry's chastising the writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Engel 1994 p. 247&quot;/&gt; Nicholas Meyer said that ''Star Trek'' had evolved &quot;into sort of a secular parallel to the [[Catholic Mass]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#fern1994|Fern (1994)]]: p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry compared the franchise to his own philosophy by saying: &quot;Understand that ''Star Trek'' is more than just my political philosophy, my racial philosophy, my overview on life and the human condition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#nichols1994|Nichols (1994)]]: p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the 1991 Humanist Arts Award from the [[American Humanist Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the AHA Archives: Gene Roddenberry|url=http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-08-from-the-aha-archives-gene-roddenberry|publisher=American Humanist Association|accessdate=April 26, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821000117/http://www.americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-08-from-the-aha-archives-gene-roddenberry|archivedate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health decline and death==
In the late 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted by the first manifestations of [[cerebral vascular disease]] and [[encephalopathy]] as a result of his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]],&lt;ref name=engel11&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[diazepam]], [[secobarbital]], [[methylphenidate]], [[Dexamyl]], and [[cocaine]] (which he had used regularly since the production of ''Star Trek: The Motion Picture'').&lt;ref name=engel238&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially [[amphetamine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]],&lt;ref name=engel11/&gt; [[high blood pressure]], and [[antidepressant]] prescriptions.&lt;ref name=engel238/&gt;

Following a [[stroke]] at a family reunion in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], in September 1989,&lt;ref&gt;[[#nichols1994|Nichols (1994)]]: p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry's health declined further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair.&lt;ref name=engel259/&gt; Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; At 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich.&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling for breath, and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a [[cardiopulmonary arrest]], and he died in the doctor's office shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander 1995 p. 7&quot;&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the [[UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica|Santa Monica Medical Center]], where he was pronounced dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hastings|first1=Deborah|title=Man who boldly launched Capt.

The [[funeral]] was arranged for November 1, with the public invited to the memorial service at the Hall of Liberty, within the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]], in [[Hollywood Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a secular service; Roddenberry had been [[cremated]] before the event. More than three hundred ''Star Trek'' fans attended, and stood in the balcony section of the hall, while the invited guests were on the floor level. Nichols sang twice during the ceremony, first &quot;[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]&quot; and then a song she wrote herself titled &quot;Gene&quot;.&lt;ref name=engelpp7to9/&gt; Both songs had been requested by Barrett.&lt;ref&gt;[[#nichols1994|Nichols (1994)]]: p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Several people spoke at the memorial, including [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], Christopher Knopf, E. Jack Newman,&lt;ref name=engelpp7to9&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Patrick Stewart]]. The ceremony was closed by two kilted pipers playing &quot;[[Amazing Grace]]&quot; as a pre-recorded message by Roddenberry was broadcast. A four-plane [[flypast]], in the [[missing man formation]], followed some thirty minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' aired a two-part episode of season five, called &quot;[[Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unification]]&quot;, which featured a dedication to Roddenberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeCandido|first1=Keith |author-link=Keith DeCandido|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Rewatch: 'Unification, Part I'|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/star-trek-the-next-generation-qunification-iq|publisher=[[Tor Books|Tor.com]]|date=June 27, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409150758/http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/star-trek-the-next-generation-qunification-iq|archivedate=April 9, 2015|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry's will left the majority of his $30 million estate to Barrett, in a trust. He also left money to his children and his first wife Eileen. However, his daughter Dawn contested the will based upon the grounds that Barrett had undue influence on her father.&lt;ref name=heir/&gt; In a hearing held in 1993, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that there were improprieties in the management of the trust and removed Barrett as executor. In another decision, the court found that Roddenberry had hidden assets from ''Star Trek'' in the [[Norway Corporation]] in order to keep funds away from his first wife, and ordered the payment of fifty percent of those assets to Eileen as well as punitive damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engel|1994|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the [[California courts of appeal|California Court of Appeals]] ruled that the original will, which stated that anyone who contested it would be disinherited, would stand.

''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' was already in development when Roddenberry died. Berman said that while he never discussed the ideas for the season, he was given a blessing by Roddenberry to pursue it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cerone|first1=Daniel|title='Trek' Rolls on Without Roddenberry|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4148503.html|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=Chicago Sun-Times|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=January 2, 1993|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berman later stated that &quot;I don't believe the 24th century is going to be like Gene Roddenberry believed it to be, that people will be free from poverty and greed.
