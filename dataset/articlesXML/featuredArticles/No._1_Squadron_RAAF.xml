'''No. 1 Squadron''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) squadron headquartered at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland. Controlled by [[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No. 82 Wing]], it is equipped with [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet]] multi-role fighters. The squadron was formed under the [[Australian Flying Corps]] in 1916 and saw action in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]]s during World War&amp;nbsp;I. It flew obsolete [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]]s, B.E.12s, [[Martinsyde G.100]]s and G.102s, as well as [[Airco DH.6]]s, [[Bristol Scout]]s and [[Nieuport&amp;nbsp;17]]s, before re-equipping with the [[Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8|R.E.8]] in October 1917 and finally the [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighter]] in December. Its commanding officer in 1917–18 was Major [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], later  known as the &quot;Father of the RAAF&quot;. Disbanded in 1919, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron was re-formed on paper as part of the RAAF in 1922, and re-established as an operational unit three years later.

During World War II, the squadron flew [[Lockheed Hudson]] bombers in the [[Malayan Campaign|Malayan]] and [[Dutch East Indies campaign]]s, suffering severe losses before being reduced to [[En cadre|cadre]] in 1942. It was re-formed with [[Bristol Beaufort]]s the following year, and re-equipped with [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s in 1945 for further operations in the Dutch East Indies. Reduced to cadre once more after the war ended, No. 1 Squadron was re-established at Amberley in 1948 as an [[Avro Lincoln]] heavy bomber unit. From 1950 to 1958 it was based in Singapore, flying missions during the [[Malayan Emergency]], where it bore the brunt of the Commonwealth air campaign against communist guerillas. When it returned to Australia it re-equipped with [[English Electric Canberra]] jet bombers. It operated [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom]]s from 1970 to 1973, as a stop-gap pending delivery of the [[General Dynamics F-111C]] swing-wing bomber. The F-111 remained in service for 37 years until replaced by the Super Hornet in 2010. From September 2014 to March 2015, a detachment of Super Hornets was deployed to the Middle East as part of [[Operation Okra|Australia's contribution]] to the [[2014 military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|military intervention against ISIL]].

==History==

===World War I===
No. 1 Squadron was established as a unit of the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC) at [[RAAF Williams|Point Cook]], Victoria, in January 1916 under the command of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] E.H. Reynolds.&lt;ref name=Eather8&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; With a complement of 28 officers, 195 airmen, no aircraft and little training, it sailed for Egypt in mid-March 1916, arriving at [[Suez]] a month later.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 24, 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; There it came under the control of the [[No. 5 Wing RAF|5th Wing]] of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC).&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; After training in England and Egypt, the unit was declared operational at its new headquarters in [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]] on 12&amp;nbsp;June, when it took over aircraft belonging to [[No. 17 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;17 Squadron RFC]]. Its three [[Flight (military unit)|flights]] were, however, operating in isolation at different bases in the [[Sinai Desert]], and the squadron did not reunite until December.&lt;ref name=Units1&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutlack35&gt;Cutlack, ''The Australian Flying Corps in the Western and Eastern Theatres'', pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; Flying primitive and poorly armed [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]] two-seat biplanes, its primary roles during this period of the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai Campaign]] were reconnaissance—including aerial photography—and artillery spotting for the [[British Army]].&lt;ref name=Units1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron pilots attached to [[No. 14 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;14 Squadron RFC]] took part in the [[Battle of Romani]] in July and August.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, ''The Australian Flying Corps in the Western and Eastern Theatres'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; In September and October, B and C Flights, led by Captains [[Oswald Watt]] and [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]] respectively, undertook bombing and reconnaissance missions in support of the [[Australian Light Horse]] in northern Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 61–62, 68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12&amp;nbsp;September 1916, the British began to refer to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron as [[No. 67 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;67 (Australian) Squadron]] RFC. This practice continued until January 1918, when the unit officially became known as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron AFC.&lt;ref name=Eather8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Units1/&gt; The relationship between airmen and ground crew was less formal than in British units; squadron members recalled that &quot;The CO is the only one who is ever called 'sir{{' &quot;}} and that officers did not demand &quot;saluting and standing to attention and all that rot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The unit received the first of several [[Martinsyde G.100]] single-seat fighters to augment the B.E.2s on 16&amp;nbsp;October; although considered obsolete, the &quot;Tinsyde&quot; was substantially faster than the B.E.2, and armed with forward-firing machine guns.&lt;ref name=Eather8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the squadron took part in a bombing raid against [[Beersheba]] on 11&amp;nbsp;November, Lieutenant [[Lawrence Wackett]] managed to fix a machine gun to the top plane of one of the B.E.2s, using a mount he designed himself.&lt;ref name=Cutlack43&gt;Cutlack, ''The Australian Flying Corps in the Western and Eastern Theatres'', pp. 43–45&lt;/ref&gt; Each flight was also assigned a [[Bristol Scout]] beginning in December, but it too was obsolete and under-powered, and the squadron ceased operating the type within three months.&lt;ref name=Eather8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutlack47&gt;Cutlack, ''The Australian Flying Corps in the Western and Eastern Theatres'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  Other older models issued to the unit included the [[Airco DH.6]], Martinsyde G.102 and [[Nieuport&amp;nbsp;17]].&lt;ref name=Eather8/&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;December, the squadron's flights were finally brought together at one base, Mustabig.&lt;ref name=Cutlack35/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

March 1917 saw the heaviest bombing campaign carried out by the squadron to date; short of its regular {{convert|20|lb|kg|adj=on}} ordnance, the pilots improvised by dropping {{convert|6|inch|mm|adj=on}} [[howitzer]] shells on Turkish forces along the [[Gaza City|Gaza]]–Beersheba line.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; During one such mission on 20&amp;nbsp;March, Lieutenant [[Frank McNamara (VC)|Frank McNamara]] earned the [[Victoria Cross]] for landing his Martinsyde in the desert under enemy fire and rescuing a fellow pilot whose B.E.2 had been forced down.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 86–88&lt;/ref&gt; On 26&amp;nbsp;March, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron took part in the [[First Battle of Gaza]]; it suffered its first combat death the next day, when one of its B.E.2s was attacked by a German [[Rumpler]].&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 88–89, 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; The unit participated in the [[Second Battle of Gaza]] on 19&amp;nbsp;April; like its predecessor, the attack was a failure for the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Williams, later known as the &quot;Father of the RAAF&quot;, assumed command of the squadron in May.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Two B.E.12s were delivered the same month; like the Martinsydes, they were armed with a forward-firing machine gun and employed as escorts for the B.E.2s.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; By June, mechanical issues caused by hot summer weather and the threat from new German [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]] scouts were rendering the B.E.2s largely ineffective, and Williams urgently requested newer models.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; Modern aircraft were eventually delivered, first the [[Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8]] in October, and then the [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]] in December.&lt;ref name=Eather8/&gt; &quot;Now for the first time,&quot; wrote Williams, &quot;after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with our enemy in the air.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Mordike | first = John | year = 2002 | title = General Sir Edmund Allenby's joint operations in Palestine, 1917–1918 | url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/49896C98_1143_EC82_2E67619953626AC0.pdf|magazine= The Royal Air Force Air Power Review |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No. 1 Squadron returned to Australia on 5&amp;nbsp;March 1919, and was disbanded.&lt;ref name=Units1/&gt; In 1921, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) was established as a separate branch of the military, and on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1922, the squadron was re-formed on paper.&lt;ref name=Units1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Its planned strength, approved by the Air Board in December 1921, was three officers and five airmen, operating four [[Airco DH.9]]s. Funding problems for the fledgling Air Force resulted in the disbandment on 1&amp;nbsp;July of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron and other units established at the same time, their aircraft and personnel instead forming a single squadron of six flights under the control of [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS) at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron was reactivated as an operational unit of the RAAF reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF), at Point Cook on 1&amp;nbsp;July 1925.&lt;ref name=Clark226&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Its commanding officer was Flight Lieutenant [[Harry Cobby]].&lt;ref name=Bombers5/&gt;

RAAF squadrons began adopting specialised roles in the early 1930s, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron becoming No.&amp;nbsp;1 Single-Engined Bomber Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1935 it was made up of two flights of newly delivered [[Hawker Demon]] fighter-bombers, and one of Wapitis.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 188, 190, 327&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1935 it was augmented by No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS's Fighter Squadron and its six [[Bristol Bulldog]]s, which were redesignated fighter-bombers.&lt;ref name=Clark187&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 1 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'' (1925–1946), pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;21]] and [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|22 (Cadre) Squadrons]] were formed on 20&amp;nbsp;April 1936 at Laverton and Richmond, respectively, absorbing the CAF personnel of Nos.&amp;nbsp;1 and 3&amp;nbsp;Squadrons, which became PAF units. The same day, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron was renamed No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Fighter Bomber) Squadron. This reorganisation temporarily denuded No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron of most of its aircraft, leaving only A&amp;nbsp;Flight, with four Bulldogs and a Wapiti, in operation.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 187, 231–232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 1 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'' (1925–1946), pp. 98–100&lt;/ref&gt; The Wapiti was transferred to No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS in July, and by the end of the month the squadron's complement of aircraft stood at four Bulldogs and one Moth.&lt;ref&gt;No. 1 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'' (1925–1946), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

No. 1 Squadron began receiving new Demons in November 1936.&lt;ref&gt;No. 1 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'' (1925–1946), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1937, it relinquished its Bulldogs to No.&amp;nbsp;21 Squadron, which was to hold them until they could be transferred to the soon-to-be-formed [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of February, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron's strength was 12 Demons and one Moth, 11 officers and 108 airmen.&lt;ref&gt;No. 1 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'' (1925–1946), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was redesignated No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Bomber) Squadron in August 1937.&lt;ref name=Clark187/&gt; Towards the end of the year, it was plagued by several Demon accidents, resulting in a series of inquiries and a review of RAAF procedures in 1938 by Marshal of the RAF [[Edward Leonard Ellington|Sir Edward Ellington]]; the so-called Ellington Report and its criticism of air safety standards led to the removal of Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams from his position as Chief of the Air Staff, which he had held since the formation of the Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 114–118, 344–348&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron received the RAAF's first three [[CAC Wirraway]]s on 10&amp;nbsp;July 1939.&lt;ref&gt;No. 1 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'' (1925–1946), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; As the likelihood of war increased, the squadron's role was altered to incorporate reconnaissance as well as bombing, resulting in the transfer out of all Demons and Wirraways and the transfer in from other units of nine [[Avro Anson]]s on 28–29 August 1939; at the end of the month its personnel comprised nine officers and 122 airmen.&lt;ref&gt;No. 1 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'' (1925–1946), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hudsons sank a Japanese transport ship, the [[IJN Awazisan Maru|IJN ''Awazisan Maru'']], and damaged two more transports, the ''Ayatosan Maru'' and ''Sakura Maru'', for the loss of two Hudsons, an hour before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=Defence&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/raaf/organisation/info_on/units/1_sqn/ |title=No. 1 Squadron |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211192008/http://www.defence.gov.au/raaf/organisation/info_on/units/1_sqn/ |archivedate=11 December 2007 |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloody1 p82-3&quot;&gt;Shores et al., ''Bloody Shambles Volume One'', pp. 80–83&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the day, Japanese ground forces had advanced to the outskirts of the airfield, forcing the squadron's remaining airworthy aircraft to be evacuated to [[Kuantan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloody1 p95-6&quot;&gt;Shores et al., ''Bloody Shambles Volume One'', pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and from there back to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;

By Christmas Eve 1941, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron had five serviceable aircraft. Together with [[No.&amp;nbsp;8 Squadron RAAF]], also equipped with Hudsons, it was tasked with maritime patrols to the east of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; On 26&amp;nbsp;January 1942, two of the squadron's Hudsons spotted a Japanese convoy heading for [[Endau]], on the east coast of Malaya. It was decided to [[Battle off Endau|attack the convoy]] with all possible strength, including four Hudsons from No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron and five from No.&amp;nbsp;8 Squadron, together with obsolete [[Vickers Vildebeest]] and [[Fairey Albacore]] biplanes of [[No. 36 Squadron RAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;36]] and [[No. 100 Squadron RAF|100 Squadrons RAF]], and with what little fighter escort could be found. The convoy was strongly defended by Japanese fighters, and although all nine Hudsons returned to Singapore, several were badly shot up. The rest of the strike force did not fare as well; 11 Vildebeests, two Albacores, two Hudsons (of [[No.&amp;nbsp;62 Squadron RAF]]) and three fighters were lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloody2 p18-38&quot;&gt;Shores et al., ''Bloody Shambles Volume Two'', pp. 18–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 344–346&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the month, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron had withdrawn to airfield P.2 on [[Sumatra]], along with several other Commonwealth units including No.&amp;nbsp;8 Squadron. It continued to attack Japanese bases in Malaya and convoys in the [[Dutch East Indies]], relocating to Semplak, [[Java]], in mid-February. At Semplak it took over the Hudsons of No.&amp;nbsp;8 Squadron and No.&amp;nbsp;62 Squadron RAF, giving it a strength of 25 aircraft; at one stage it was to be renumbered as an RAF squadron, but this never occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp.&amp;nbsp;120–125&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily outnumbered by Japanese air units, which raided Allied bases with impunity, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron suffered heavy losses and was ordered to withdraw its four remaining Hudsons to Australia on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1942, disbanding soon after. Although 120 of the squadron's personnel were evacuated from Java, 160 men including the commanding officer, Wing Commander Davis, were unable to escape and were taken prisoner by the Japanese; less than half survived captivity.&lt;ref name=Eather19/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp.&amp;nbsp;125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron re-equipped with Canberra Mk.20s after returning to Australia.&lt;ref name=Eather19/&gt; The RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra was subsonic but had long range and was highly manoeuvrable. It had been procured partly for its capacity to deliver [[nuclear weapon]]s, an ordnance option the government seriously contemplated but never acquired. Initially the Canberra's envisaged mission profile was medium-to-high-altitude area bombing but its primitive bombsight and light load made this a dubious proposition, and by mid-1961 crews were training in low-level army cooperation tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 363–369&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Publications/Details/568/220-The-RAAFs-Strike-Capability-Part-II-Development-19452014.aspx#.U3TSPhCSySo|title=The RAAF's Strike Capability Part II: Development 1945–2014|work=Pathfinder|date=April 2014|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron was awarded successive Gloucester Cups for its proficiency in 1959–60 and 1960–61.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article103082243 |title=Cup award to jet squadron |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=31 July 1961 |accessdate=5 September 2014 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 1962, its strength was eight aircraft and 53 personnel, including 18 officers.&lt;ref&gt;No. 1 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'' (1961–1988), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The unit effectively ceased operations in 1968, to begin converting to the [[General Dynamics F-111C]] supersonic bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Already controversial owing to its escalating cost, the F-111 program was heavily delayed by airworthiness concerns related to its [[Variable-sweep wing|swing-wing]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 380–384&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1970, as an interim measure while awaiting delivery of the F-111, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron relinquished its Canberras for leased [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms]], which it operated until June 1973.&lt;ref name=Canberra&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A84.htm |title=Canberra|publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Lincoln, Canberra and F-111 in Australian Service'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service'', pp. 41, 56&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Phantom had a multi-role capability, the RAAF employed it as a strike aircraft to maintain compatibility with the proposed F-111 mission profile.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; One of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron's Phantoms was lost with its crew of two in June 1971, the only fatalities and hull loss of the 24 aircraft leased to the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and well regarded by its Australian crews.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 387–388&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with its revolutionary variable-sweep wings, the F-111 was equipped with [[terrain-following radar]] and an escape module that allowed the entire cockpit to be jettisoned in an emergency, instead of individual ejection seats.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Its top speed was [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.5 and its [[combat radius]] gave it the capability of reaching targets in Indonesia from bases in northern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon delivery in 1973 it was fitted with analogue [[avionics]] and could only drop [[unguided bomb|unguided (&quot;dumb&quot;) bombs]].

Both F-111 squadrons were deployed to [[RAAF Base Tindal]], Northern Territory, to support the international forces in case of action by the Indonesian military, and remained there until December; six of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron's aircraft and approximately 100 personnel were involved. From 20&amp;nbsp;September, when INTERFET forces began to arrive in East Timor, the F-111s were maintained at a high level of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes if the situation deteriorated. As it happened, INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance, and F-111 operations were limited to reconnaissance by RF-111Cs from 5&amp;nbsp;November through 9&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Warden to Tanager'', pp. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt;
