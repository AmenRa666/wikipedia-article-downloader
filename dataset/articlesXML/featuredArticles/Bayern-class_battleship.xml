The '''''Bayern'' class''' was a [[Ship class|class]] of four [[super-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s built by the [[German Empire|German]] [[Imperial German Navy|Kaiserliche Marine]] (Imperial Navy). The class comprised {{SMS|Bayern||2}}, {{SMS|Baden||2}}, ''Sachsen'', and ''Württemberg''. Construction started on the ships shortly before [[World War I]]; ''Baden'' was laid down in 1913, ''Bayern'' and ''Sachsen'' followed in 1914, and ''Württemberg'', the final ship, was laid down in 1915. Only ''Baden'' and ''Bayern'' were completed, due to shipbuilding priorities changing as the war dragged on. It was determined that [[U-boat]]s were more valuable to the war effort, and so work on new battleships was slowed and ultimately stopped altogether. As a result, ''Bayern'' and ''Baden'' were the last German battleships completed by the Kaiserliche Marine.{{sfn|Hore|p=70}}

''Bayern'' and ''Baden'' were commissioned into the fleet in July 1916 and March 1917, respectively. This was too late for either ship to take part in the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May and 1 June 1916. ''Bayern'' was assigned to the naval force that drove the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] from the [[Gulf of Riga]] during [[Operation Albion]] in October 1917, though the ship was severely damaged from a [[naval mine|mine]] and had to be withdrawn to [[Kiel]] for repairs. ''Baden'' replaced {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}} as the [[flagship]] of the [[High Seas Fleet]], but saw no combat.

Both ''Bayern'' and ''Baden'' were interned in [[Scapa Flow]] following the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]] in November 1918. Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], the commander of the interned German fleet, [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|ordered his ships be sunk]] on 21 June 1919; ''Bayern'' was successfully scuttled, though British guards managed to beach ''Baden'' to prevent her from sinking. The ship was eventually expended as a gunnery target in 1921. ''Sachsen'' and ''Württemberg'', both at various stages of completion when the war ended, were broken up for scrap metal. ''Bayern'' was raised in 1934 and broken up the following year.

== Design ==

The ''Bayern''-class ships were a result of the fourth [[German Naval Laws|Naval Law]], which was passed in 1912. Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] used public outcry over the British involvement in the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911 to pressure the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] into appropriating additional funds for the Navy. The Fourth Naval Law secured funding for three new dreadnoughts, two [[light cruiser]]s, and an increase of an additional 15,000 officers and men in the ranks of the Navy for 1912.{{sfn|Herwig|p=77}} The capital ships laid down in 1912 were the {{sclass-|Derfflinger|battlecruiser|2}}s; funding for ''Bayern'' and ''Baden'' was allocated the following year.{{sfn|Herwig|p=81}}{{sfn|Sturton|p=38}} Funding for ''Sachsen'' was allocated in the 1914 budget, while ''Württemberg'' was funded in the War Estimates.{{sfn|Sturton|p=41}} The last remaining {{sclass-|Brandenburg|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought]], {{SMS|Wörth||2}}, was to be replaced, as well as two elderly {{sclass-|Kaiser Friedrich III|battleship|0}} pre-dreadnoughts, {{SMS|Kaiser Wilhelm II||2}} and {{SMS|Kaiser Friedrich III||2}}. ''Baden'' was ordered as ''Ersatz Wörth'', ''Württemberg'' as ''Ersatz Kaiser Wilhelm II'', and ''Sachsen'' as ''Ersatz Kaiser Friedrich III''; ''Bayern'' was regarded as an addition to the fleet, and was ordered under the provisional name &quot;T&quot;.{{sfn|Gröner|p=28}}{{efn|name=provisional names}}

The design for the ships was drawn up between 1910 and 1912.{{sfn|Gröner|p=28}} Consideration was given to equipping the new ships with triple turrets mounting the 30.5&amp;nbsp;cm (12&amp;nbsp;in) guns of the preceding {{sclass-|König|battleship|2}}s, but after examining the gun turrets of the Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts of the {{sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|4}}, it was determined that the triple gun turrets still had too many problems. Among these deficiencies were increased weight, reduced ammunition supply and rate of fire, and loss of fighting capability if one of the turrets was disabled. It was therefore decided to arm the new vessels with eight 38&amp;nbsp;cm guns instead of twelve 30.5&amp;nbsp;cm guns.{{sfn|Hore|p=70}}

=== General characteristics ===

''Bayern'' and ''Baden'' were {{convert|179.4|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]], and an even {{convert|180|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. ''Sachsen'' and ''Württemberg'' were slightly longer: {{convert|181.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}&amp;nbsp;m at the waterline and {{convert|182.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}} overall. All four ships had a beam of {{convert|30|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and had a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of between {{convert|9.3|and|9.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. ''Bayern'' and ''Baden'' were designed to displace {{convert|28530|t|LT|abbr=on}} at a normal displacement; at full combat load, the ships displaced up to {{convert|32200|t|LT|abbr=on}}. ''Württemberg'' and ''Sachsen'' were slightly heavier, at 28,800&amp;nbsp;t normal and 32,500&amp;nbsp;t fully laden. The ships were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were [[rivet]]ed. The [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was divided into 17 [[watertight compartment]]s, and included a [[double bottom]] that ran for 88 percent of the length of the hull.{{sfn|Gröner|p=28}}

''Bayern'' and ''Baden'' were regarded as exceptional sea boats by the German navy. ''Bayern'' and her sisters were stable and very maneuverable. The ships suffered slight speed loss in heavy seas; with the [[rudder]]s hard over, the ships lost up to 62% speed and heeled over 7&amp;nbsp;degrees. With a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|2.53|m|ftin|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Gröner|p=30}} larger than that of their British equivalents, the vessels were stable gun platforms for the confined waters of the North Sea.{{sfn|Lyon &amp; Moore|p=104}}{{efn|name=metacentric height}}

The ships of the ''Bayern'' class had a standard crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men; when serving as a squadron flagship, an additional 14 officers and 86 men were required. The vessels carried several smaller craft, including one [[picket boat]], three barges, two [[launch (boat)|launches]], two [[yawl]]s, and two [[dinghy|dinghies]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=30}}

=== Machinery ===

''Bayern'' and ''Baden'' were equipped with 11 coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft [[boiler]]s and three oil-fired Schulz-Thornycroft boilers in nine boiler rooms. Three sets of Parsons turbines drove three-bladed [[propeller|screws]] that were {{convert|3.87|m}} in diameter. ''Bayern''{{'}}s and ''Baden''{{'}}s power plant was designed to run at {{convert|{{convert|35000|PS|shp|0|disp=number}}|shp|kW|lk=on}} at 265&amp;nbsp;revolutions per minute; on trials the ships achieved {{convert|{{convert|55967|PS|shp|0|disp=number}}|shp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|{{convert|56275|PS|shp|0|disp=number}}|shp|kW|abbr=on}}, respectively. Both ships were capable of a maximum speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}. The first two ships were initially designed to carry {{convert|900|t|LT|abbr=on}} of coal and {{convert|200|t|LT|abbr=on}} of oil, though fuel bunkerage was subsequently increased to {{convert|3400|t|LT|abbr=on}} of coal and {{convert|620|t|LT|abbr=on}} of oil. This enabled a range of {{convert|5000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|12|kn}}. At {{convert|15|kn}}, the range decreased to {{convert|4485|nmi|abbr=on}}, at {{convert|17|kn}} the range fell to {{convert|3740|nmi|abbr=on}}, and at {{convert|21.5|kn}} the ships could steam for only {{convert|2390|nmi|abbr=on}}. The ships carried eight diesel generators; these supplied each ship with a total of 2,400&amp;nbsp;kilowatts of electrical power at 220&amp;nbsp;[[volt]]s.{{sfn|Gröner|p=28}}

''Sachsen'' and ''Württemberg'' were intended to be one knot faster than the earlier pair of ships.{{sfn|Greger|p=37}} ''Württemberg'' received more powerful machinery that would have produced {{convert|{{convert|48000|PS|shp|0|disp=number}}|shp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} for a designed speed of 22 knots. On ''Sachsen'', a [[MAN SE|MAN]] [[diesel engine]] producing {{convert|{{convert|12000|PS|bhp|0|disp=number}}|bhp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} was installed on the center shaft, while steam turbines powered the outboard shafts. The combined power plant would have produced {{convert|{{convert|54000|PS|shp|0|disp=number}}|shp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} for a designed speed of 22.5 knots.{{sfn|Gröner|p=28}}

=== Armament ===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R17062, Linienschiff &quot;Baden&quot;.jpg|thumb|''Baden'', main battery trained to port|alt=Overhead view of a large battleship; black smoke pours from its smoke stacks as it steams through choppy seas.]]

The ''Bayern''-class battleships were armed with a main battery of eight 38&amp;nbsp;cm (15&amp;nbsp;in) SK L/45 guns{{efn|name=gun nomenclature}} in four Drh LC/1913 twin [[gun turret]]s. These turrets could train 150&amp;nbsp;degrees to either side of the centerline,{{sfn|NavWeaps (38 cm/45)}} and their guns could depress to −8&amp;nbsp;degrees. As the Germans thought that conditions in the North Sea would dictate short-range actions, the guns initially could elevate only to 16&amp;nbsp;degrees,{{sfn|Lyon &amp; Moore|p=104}} which allowed a maximum range of 20,400&amp;nbsp;m. The gun mountings were modified to allow elevation up to 20&amp;nbsp;degrees, increasing the range to 23,200&amp;nbsp;m.{{sfn|NavWeaps (38 cm/45)}}

The main battery was supplied with a total of 720 shells or 90 rounds per gun.{{sfn|Gröner|p=30}} The guns had a [[rate of fire]] of around 2.5 shells per minute. Post-war tests conducted by the British [[Royal Navy]] showed that the guns on ''Baden'' could be ready to fire again 23 seconds after firing; this was significantly faster than their British contemporaries, the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|4}}, which took 36 seconds between salvos.{{sfn|NavWeaps (38 cm/45)}} The German weapons were, however, less accurate than earlier German weapons, and fired a lighter shell than the equivalent British guns.{{sfn|Lyon &amp; Moore|p=104}} The German armor-piercing shell weighed 750&amp;nbsp;kg (1,653&amp;nbsp;lb) and was driven by a 277&amp;nbsp;kg (610.7&amp;nbsp;lb) RPC/12 propellant charge in a brass cartridge. The shells were fired at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 800&amp;nbsp;mps (2,625&amp;nbsp;fps). Each gun was expected to fire 300 shells before replacement of the barrel was required. The guns that had been constructed for the battleships ''Sachsen'' and ''Württemberg'' were eventually used as long-range, heavy siege guns on the Western Front, as coastal guns in occupied France and Belgium, and a few as railway guns; these guns were referred to as [[38 cm SK L/45 &quot;Max&quot;|Langer Max]].{{sfn|NavWeaps (38 cm/45)}}

The ships were also armed with a secondary battery of sixteen 15&amp;nbsp;cm (5.9&amp;nbsp;in) SK L/45 quick-firing guns, each mounted in MPL C/13 [[casemate]]s in the side of the top deck.{{sfn|NavWeaps (15 cm/45)}} These guns were intended for defense against torpedo boats, and were supplied with a total of 2,240 shells. The guns could engage targets out to 13,500&amp;nbsp;m, and after improvements in 1915, their range was extended to 16,800&amp;nbsp;m. The guns had a sustained [[rate of fire]] of 5 to 7 rounds per minute. The shells were 45.3&amp;nbsp;kg (99.8&amp;nbsp;lb), and were loaded with a 13.7&amp;nbsp;kg (31.2&amp;nbsp;lb) RPC/12 [[propellant]] charge in a brass cartridge. The guns fired at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 835&amp;nbsp;meters per second (2,740&amp;nbsp;ft/s). The guns were expected to fire around 1,400 shells before they needed to be replaced.{{sfn|NavWeaps (15 cm/45)}}

''Bayern'' and ''Baden'' were also equipped with a pair of 8.8&amp;nbsp;cm (3.45&amp;nbsp;in) L/45 [[flak]] guns, which were supplied with 800 rounds.{{sfn|Gröner|p=30}} The guns were emplaced in MPL C/13 mountings, which allowed depression to −10&amp;nbsp;degrees and elevation to 70&amp;nbsp;degrees. These guns fired 9&amp;nbsp;kg (19.8&amp;nbsp;lb) shells, and had an effective ceiling of 9,150&amp;nbsp;m at 70&amp;nbsp;degrees.{{sfn|NavWeaps (8.8 cm/45)}}

As was customary on capital ships of the period, the ''Bayern''-class ships were armed with five 60&amp;nbsp;cm (24&amp;nbsp;in) submerged torpedo tubes. One tube was mounted in the bow and two on each broadside. A total of 20 torpedoes were carried per ship. However, both ''Bayern'' and ''Baden'' struck mines in 1917; the damage incurred revealed structural weaknesses caused by the torpedo tubes; both ships had their lateral tubes removed.{{sfn|Gröner|p=30}} The torpedoes were the H8 type, which were {{convert|8|m|ftin|sp=us}} long and carried a 210&amp;nbsp;kg (463&amp;nbsp;lb) [[Hexanite]] warhead. The torpedoes had a range of 6,000&amp;nbsp;m (6,550&amp;nbsp;yd) when set at a speed of 36&amp;nbsp;knots; at a reduced speed of 30&amp;nbsp;knots, the range increased significantly to 14,000&amp;nbsp;m (15,310&amp;nbsp;yd).{{sfn|NavWeaps (Torpedoes)}}

=== Armor ===

[[File:SMS-Bayern-protection-scheme-EN.svg|thumb|left|Protection scheme.]]

The ''Bayern''-class ships were protected with [[Krupp]] [[Krupp cemented armor|cemented steel armor]], as was the standard for German warships of the period. They had an [[armor belt]] that was {{convert|350|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} thick in the central citadel of the ship, where the most important parts of the ship were located. This included the ammunition magazines and the machinery spaces. The belt was reduced in less critical areas, to {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|170|mm|in|abbr=on}} aft. The [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and [[stern]] were not protected by armor at all. A {{convert|50|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}}-thick [[torpedo bulkhead]] ran the length of the hull, several meters behind the main belt. The main armored deck was {{convert|60|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} thick in most places, though the thickness of the sections that covered the more important areas of the ship was increased to {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gröner|p=28}}

The forward [[conning tower]] was protected with heavy armor: the sides were {{convert|400|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} thick and the roof was 170&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The rear conning tower was less well armored; its sides were only 170&amp;nbsp;mm thick and the roof was covered with {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} of armor plate. The main battery gun turrets were also heavily armored: the turret sides were 350&amp;nbsp;mm thick and the roofs were 200&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The 15&amp;nbsp;cm guns had 170&amp;nbsp;mm thick armor plating on the casemates; the guns themselves had 80&amp;nbsp;mm thick shields to protect their crews from shell splinters.{{sfn|Gröner|p=28}}

== Construction ==
The class was planned to include four ships. {{SMS|Bayern||2}} was built by [[Howaldtswerke]] in [[Kiel]] under construction number 590; she was laid down in 1913, launched on 18 February 1915, and completed on 15 July 1916. {{SMS|Baden||2}} was built by the [[Schichau-Werke|Schichau]] shipyard in [[Danzig]], under construction number 913. The ship was launched on 30 October 1915 and commissioned into the fleet on 14 March 1917. ''Sachsen'' was laid down at the [[Germaniawerft]] dockyard in [[Kiel]], under construction number 210. She was launched on 21 November 1916, but not completed.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=28–30}} ''Sachsen'' was by then 9 months from completion.{{sfn|Herwig|p=83}} ''Württemberg'' was constructed by [[AG Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]] under construction number 19. She was launched on 20 June 1917, but she too was not completed and scrapped in 1921.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=28–30}} At the time of cancellation, ''Württemberg'' was approximately 12 months from completion.{{sfn|Herwig|p=83}}

== Service history ==

=== Fleet sortie of 18–19 August 1916 ===

During the fleet sortie on 18–19&amp;nbsp;August 1916, the [[I&amp;nbsp;Scouting Group]], which was the [[battlecruiser]] reconnaissance force of the High Seas Fleet and commanded by Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]], was to bombard the coastal town of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. As {{SMS|Moltke||2}} and {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}} were the only two remaining German battlecruisers still in fighting condition after the [[Battle of Jutland]], three dreadnoughts were assigned to the unit for the operation: ''Bayern'', and the two {{sclass-|König|battleship|0}} ships {{SMS|Markgraf||2}} and {{SMS|Grosser Kurfürst|1913|2}}. Admiral Scheer and the rest of the High Seas Fleet, with 15 dreadnoughts of its own, would trail behind and provide cover.{{sfn|Massie|p=682}} The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the [[Grand Fleet]] to meet them. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11&amp;nbsp;weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.{{sfn|Massie|p=683}}

=== Operation Albion ===

{{main|Operation Albion}}

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of [[Riga]], the German navy decided to evict the Russian naval forces that still held the [[Gulf of Riga]]. To this end, the ''Admiralstab'' (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic islands of [[Saaremaa|Ösel]], particularly the Russian gun batteries on the [[Sõrve Peninsula|Sworbe peninsula]].{{sfn|Halpern|p=213}} On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint Army-Navy operation to capture Ösel and [[Muhu|Moon]] islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the [[flagship]], the battlecruiser {{SMS|Moltke||2}}, along with the III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. The V Division included the four {{sclass-|König|battleship|2}}s, and was by this time augmented with ''Bayern''. The VI Division consisted of the five {{sclass-|Kaiser|battleship|2}}s. Along with nine light cruisers, 3 torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of [[naval mine|mine]] warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, and were supported by over 100 aircraft and 6 zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Halpern|pp=214–215}} Opposing the Germans were the old Russian [[pre-dreadnought]]s {{ship|Russian battleship|Slava||2}} and {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}}, the [[armored cruiser]]s {{ship|Russian cruiser|Bayan|1907|2}}, {{ship|Russian cruiser|Admiral Makarov||2}}, and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Diana||2}}, 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on Ösel numbered some 14,000 men.{{sfn|Halpern|p=215}}

The operation began on 12 October, when ''Moltke'', ''Bayern'', and the ''König''s began firing on the Russian shore batteries at Tagga Bay. Simultaneously, the ''Kaiser''s engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the objective was to secure the channel between Moon and [[Hiiumaa|Dagö]] islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the gulf. Both ''Grosser Kurfürst'' and ''Bayern'' struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions; damage to the former was minimal, and the ship remained in action. However, ''Bayern'' was severely damaged, and temporary repairs proved ineffective. The ship had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs; the return trip took 19 days.{{sfn|Halpern|p=215}}

=== Fleet sortie of 23–24 April 1918 ===

[[File:SMS Bayern.jpg|thumb|''Baden'' underway]]

In late 1917, the High Seas Fleet began to conduct anti-convoy raids with light craft in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. On 17 October, the German [[light cruiser]]s {{SMS|Brummer||2}} and {{SMS|Bremse||2}} intercepted a convoy of twelve ships escorted by a pair of destroyers and destroyed it; only three transports managed to escape. On 12 December, four German destroyers intercepted and annihilated another convoy of five ships and two escorting destroyers. This prompted Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]], the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect the convoys in the North Sea.{{sfn|Massie|p=747}} This presented to Admiral Scheer the opportunity for which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion of the Grand Fleet.{{sfn|Massie|p=748}}

At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the entire High Seas Fleet, including ''Bayern'' and ''Baden'', left harbor with the intention of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept to a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation. However, at 05:10 on 24 April, the battlecruiser ''Moltke'' suffered severe mechanical problems and had to be towed back to Wilhelmshaven. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters. In fact, there was no convoy sailing on 24 April; German naval intelligence had miscalculated the sailing date by one day.{{sfn|Massie|p=748}}

=== Wilhelmshaven mutiny ===

{{main|Wilhelmshaven mutiny}}

In October 1918, Admiral Hipper, now the commander of the entire High Seas Fleet, planned for a final battle with the Grand Fleet. Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], the Chief of the Naval Staff, approved the plan on 27 October; the operation was set for the 30th.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=281–281}} However, when the fleet was ordered to assemble in Wilhelmshaven on 29 October, war-weary crews began to desert or openly disobey their orders. Crews aboard {{SMS|König||2}}, {{SMS|Kronprinz||2}}, and {{SMS|Markgraf||2}} demonstrated for peace. The crew aboard {{SMS|Thüringen||2}} was the first to openly mutiny; {{SMS|Helgoland||2}} and {{SMS|Kaiserin||2}} joined as well.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=281}} By the evening of the 29th, red flags of revolution flew from the masts of dozens of warships in the harbor. In spite of this, Hipper decided to hold a last meeting aboard ''Baden''—his flagship—to discuss the operation with the senior officers of the fleet. The following morning, it was clear the mutiny was too far gone to permit a fleet action. In an attempt to suppress the revolt, he ordered one of the battle squadrons to depart for Kiel.{{sfn|Woodman|pp=237–238}} By 5 November, red flags had been raised on every battleship in the harbor except ''König'', though it too was commandeered by a sailors' council on 6 November.{{sfn|Schwartz|p=48}}

=== Fate ===

{{main|Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow}}
[[File:SMS Bayern sinking2.jpg|thumb|''Bayern'' sinking stern-first in Scapa Flow|alt=A large light gray battleship tilts back in choppy water as it slowly sinks.]]

Following the [[armistice with Germany]] in November 1918, the majority of the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the British naval base in [[Scapa Flow]].{{sfn|Tarrant|p=282}} ''Bayern'' was listed as one of the ships to be handed over, though ''Baden'' initially was not. The battlecruiser {{SMS|Mackensen||2}}, which the British believed to be completed, was requested instead. When it became apparent to the Allies that ''Mackensen'' was still under construction, ''Baden'' was ordered to replace it.{{sfn|Herwig|p=255}} On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser {{HMS|Cardiff|D58|6}}, before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow.{{sfn|Herwig|pp=254–255}} ''Baden'' arrived at Scapa Flow separately on 14 December 1918.{{sfn|Preston|p=85}}

When the ships were interned, they had their guns disabled through the removal of their breech blocks.{{sfn|Herwig|p=255}} The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the [[Versailles Treaty]]. It became apparent to Reuter that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty.{{efn|name=armistice expiry}} To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.{{sfn|Herwig|p=256}} ''Bayern'' sank at 14:30, but ''Baden'' was run aground by British guards; she was the only capital ship that was not sunk. After being refloated and thoroughly examined, ''Baden'' was expended as a gunnery target, finally being sunk on 16 August 1921 to the southwest of Portsmouth. ''Bayern'' was eventually raised for scrapping on 1 September 1934 and broken up over the following year in [[Rosyth]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=30}}

Both ''Sachsen'' and ''Württemberg'' were stricken from the German Navy under the terms of [[s:Treaty of Versailles/Part V#Article 186|Article 186]] of the Versailles Treaty. ''Sachsen'' was sold for scrapping in 1920 to ship breakers at the Kiel Arsenal. ''Württemberg'' was sold the following year in 1921, and broken up in Hamburg.{{sfn|Gröner|p=30}}

{{notes
| notes =

{{efn
| name = provisional names
| All German ships were ordered under provisional names; additions to the fleet were given a letter, while ships that were intended to replace older vessels were ordered as &quot;[[Ersatz]] (ship name).&quot; An example of this practice is the {{sclass-|Derfflinger|battlecruiser|2}}s: the [[lead ship]] {{SMS|Derfflinger}} was considered an addition to the fleet, and was ordered as &quot;K&quot;, while her sisters {{SMS|Lützow||2}} and {{SMS|Hindenburg||2}} were ordered as ''Ersatz Kaiserin Augusta'' and ''Ersatz Hertha'', being replacements for two older ships. See: {{harvnb|Gröner|p=56}}.
}}

{{efn
| name = metacentric height
| [[Metacentric height]] (the distance between the [[center of gravity]]—G—and the metacenter—M—abbreviated as GM) determines a ship's tendency to roll in the water; if the GM is too low, the ship will tend to roll severely or even risk [[capsize|capsizing]].
}}

{{efn
| name = gun nomenclature
| In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, &quot;SK&quot; (Schnelladekanone) denotes that the gun is quick firing, while the L/45 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/45 gun is 45 [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]], meaning that the gun barrel is 45 times as long as it is in bore diameter. See: {{harvnb|Grießmer|p=177}}.
}}

{{efn
| name = armistice expiry
| By this time, the Armistice had been extended to 23 June, though there is some contention as to whether von Reuter was aware of this. Admiral [[Sydney Fremantle]] stated that he informed von Reuter on the evening of the 20th, though von Reuter claims he was unaware of the development. For Fremantle's claim, see {{harvnb|Bennett|p=307}}. For von Reuter's statement, see {{harvnb|Herwig|p=256}}.
