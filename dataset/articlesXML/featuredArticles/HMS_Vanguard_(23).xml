'''HMS ''Vanguard''''' was a British [[fast battleship]] built during [[World War II]] and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] after the war. She was the only ship of her class and was the biggest, fastest and last of the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[battleship]]s&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 1, 10&lt;/ref&gt; and the final [[battleship]] to be [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] in the world. Work on the ship's design commenced before the war because the Royal Navy anticipated being outnumbered by the combined German and Japanese battleships in the early 1940s. The British had enough {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} guns and turrets in storage to allow one ship of a modified {{sclass-|Lion|battleship|2}} design to be completed faster than the ships of that class that had already been [[laid down]]. Work on ''Vanguard'' was started and stopped several times during the war and even after construction had begun, her design was revised several times to reflect war experience. These stoppages and changes prevented her from being completed during the war.

''Vanguard''{{'}}s first task after completing her [[sea trial]] at the end of 1946 was, early the next year, to convey [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and his family on the first Royal Tour of [[South Africa]] by a reigning monarch.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; While refitting after her return, she was selected for another [[Royal visits to Australia|Royal Tour of Australia]] and New Zealand in 1948. This was cancelled due to King George's declining health and ''Vanguard'' briefly became flagship of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in early 1949. After her return home in mid-1949, she became flagship of the [[Home Fleet]] Training Squadron. Throughout her career, the battleship usually served as the flagship of any unit to which she was assigned. During the early 1950s, ''Vanguard'' was involved in a number of training exercises with [[NATO]] forces. In 1953 she participated in Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s [[Coronation Review#Elizabeth II|Coronation Review]]. While she was refitting in 1955, the [[Admiralty]] announced that the ship was going to be put into [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|reserve]] upon completion of the work. ''Vanguard'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] and was broken up beginning in 1960.

==Design and description==
By early 1939 it was clear that the first two {{sclass-|Lion|battleship|2}}s could not be delivered before 1943 at the earliest and that further battleship construction would be necessary to match the German and Japanese battleships already under construction. The main constraint on the construction of any new battleships was the limited available capacity and the time required to build large-calibre guns and their gun turrets. Using four existing twin 15-inch mountings offered the possibility of bypassing this bottleneck and allowed the construction of a single fast battleship more quickly than building more ''Lion''-class ships. The turrets were originally built for the [[battlecruiser]]s {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}} during World War I and were removed during the conversions of these ships to [[aircraft carrier]]s in the 1920s. To save time, the ''Lion'' design was modified to accommodate the four turrets, and preliminary design work began in July 1939. The square or [[transom (nautical)|transom]] stern was retained as it was estimated to improve speed at full power by {{convert|.33|kn|lk=in}}. This made ''Vanguard'' the only British battleship built with a transom stern as the ''Lion''s were never finished.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, pp. 274, 281–83, 298–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;

Design work was suspended on 11 September after the start of World War II, but resumed in February 1940 after the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Winston Churchill]], expressed an interest in the ship. The design was modified to increase protection against shell splinters on the unprotected sides of the ship's hull, the armour of the secondary armament was increased to resist {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|semi-armour-piercing]] bombs, and the splinter [[Belt armor|belt's]] thickness fore and aft of the main armour belt was reduced by {{convert|0.5|in|1}} in compensation. A small [[conning tower]] was added aft, and four [[Unrotated Projectile]] mounts were added to supplement the six octuple-barrel [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|2-pounder]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mounts already planned.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, pp. 321–22&lt;/ref&gt;

More pressing commitments forced the preliminary design work to be suspended again in June and, when it resumed in October, the design was modified again in light of recent war experience. Greater fuel capacity was added and the armour protection improved, but these changes deepened the design's [[Draft (hull)|draught]] so that it exceeded the {{convert|34|ft|1|adj=on}} limit of the [[Suez Canal]]. The thickness of the main belt was reduced by {{convert|1|in}} to save weight, but the primary method chosen to reduce the draught was to increase the [[beam (nautical)|beam]] by {{convert|2.5|ft}}. This exceeded the width of the [[Dock (maritime)|docks]] at [[Rosyth]] and [[Plymouth]], which severely limited the number of docks that could handle the ship, but these changes were approved by the [[Board of Admiralty]] on 17 April 1941. The ship had already been ordered on 14 March&lt;ref name=rr2&gt;Raven and Roberts, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; under the 1940 Emergency War Programme,&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, p. 687&lt;/ref&gt; although the drawings were not turned over to [[John Brown &amp; Company]] until ten days later.&lt;ref name=rr2/&gt;

''Vanguard''{{'}}s design was revised again, while the ship was under construction in 1942, to reflect lessons learned from the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|loss]] of the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|0}} battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} and operations with the other battleships. The space between the inboard and outboard propeller shafts was increased from {{convert|33.5|to|51.5|ft|1}} to prevent a single torpedo from wrecking both shafts, and watertight access [[trunk (structural)|trunks]] were added to all spaces below the deep waterline to prevent progressive flooding through open watertight doors and hatches as happened to ''Prince of Wales''. This change and the relocation of some of the {{convert|5.25|in|0|adj=on}} ammunition handling rooms from the lower deck to the middle deck seriously delayed the ship's completion. The design requirement that the guns of 'A' turret be capable of firing straight ahead at 0° of elevation was sacrificed to allow her [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] forward to be increased, and her bow was reshaped to make it less prone to shipping water and throwing [[sea spray]] in [[head sea]]s. The ship's fuel supply was increased from {{convert|4400|LT|t}} to {{convert|4850|LT}} to prevent the fuel shortage problems suffered by {{HMS|King George V|41|2}} and {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} during their pursuit of the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck}}. The Unrotated Projectile mounts were deleted from the design, and the light anti-aircraft armament was increased to a total of 76 two-pounders in one quadruple and nine octuple mounts and 24 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]] were also added in 12 twin mounts. Space for these was made available by removing the two [[floatplane]]s, the [[aircraft catapult|catapult]], and their associated facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, pp. 285, 291–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

A proposal was made in 1942 to convert ''Vanguard'' to an aircraft carrier. The [[Director of Naval Construction]] stated that doing so along the lines of the {{sclass-|Audacious|aircraft carrier|4}} would present no major difficulties, but would require six months to redesign the ship. The proposal was formally rejected on 17 July.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

===General characteristics===
''Vanguard'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|814|ft|4|in|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|107|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and a draught of {{convert|36|ft|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. She displaced {{convert|44,500|LT|t}} at [[Standard displacement#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|51,420|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship was significantly larger than her predecessors of the class, almost {{convert|50|ft|m|1}} longer, and displaced about {{convert|6000|LT|t}} more than the older ships at deep load. ''Vanguard'' was overweight by some {{convert|2200|LT}}, which magnified the difference. The ship had a complete [[double bottom]] {{convert|5|ft|1}} deep, and she was divided into 27 main compartments by watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]].&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, pp. 284, 297, 335, 338–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS Vanguard - Operation Mainbrace 1952 - I03681.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Vanguard'' during [[NATO]] [[Operation Mainbrace]], 1952]]
The ''King&amp;nbsp;George&amp;nbsp;V''-class ships had been built with almost no [[sheer (ship)|sheer]] to the main deck forwards to allow 'A' turret to fire straight forward at zero elevation, resulting in a poor sea boat that took a lot of water over the bow. ''Vanguard''{{'}}s bow was redesigned as a result of experience with the ''King George V''s, and a large amount of sheer and [[flare (ship)|flare]] was applied to the bow. The ship was well regarded as [[seaworthy]], able to keep an even keel in rough seas. At full load, ''Vanguard'' had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|8.2|ft|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, pp. 296, 299&lt;/ref&gt;

As a fleet [[flagship]], her complement was 115 officers and 1,860 men in 1947. [[Air conditioning]] was provided for many of the ship's control spaces, and [[asbestos]] insulation was provided on exposed areas of the ship's sides, decks and bulkheads. Steam heating was provided for her armament, instruments, look-out positions and other equipment to make ''Vanguard'' suitable for operations in the [[Arctic]]. An [[Action Information Center|Action Information Centre]] was fitted below the main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around ''Vanguard''.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, pp. 328, 339&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propulsion===
To save design time, the four-shaft unit machinery from the ''Lion''-class battleship was duplicated with alternating boiler and engine rooms.&lt;ref name=rr2/&gt; ''Vanguard'' had four sets of single-reduction geared [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbines|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s housed in separate engine rooms. Each set consisted of one high-pressure and one low-pressure turbine, driving a [[propeller]] that was {{convert|14|ft|9|in|m|1}} in diameter. The turbines were powered by eight [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s in four boiler rooms at a working pressure of {{convert|350|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} and temperature of {{convert|700|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, pp. 297, 305&lt;/ref&gt; The engines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|130000|shp}} and a speed of {{convert|30|kn}}, but achieved more than {{convert|136000|shp|abbr=on}} during the ship's [[sea trial]]s in July 1946, when she reached a speed of {{convert|31.57|knots}}.&lt;ref name=r4&gt;Raven and Roberts, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; After trials, the three-bladed propellers on the inboard shafts were replaced by five-bladed propellers in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce vibrations of the inboard propeller shafts.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vanguard'' was designed to carry 4,850 long tons of [[fuel oil]] and {{convert|427|LT|t}} of [[diesel fuel]]. With a clean bottom, she could steam at a speed of {{convert|15|knots}} for {{convert|8250|nmi|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; The ship had four {{convert|480|kW|adj=on}} [[turbogenerator]]s and four {{convert|450|kW|adj=on}} [[diesel generator]]s that supplied the common [[ring main]] at 220 [[volt]]s. Their total output of {{convert|3720|kW}} was the largest of any British battleship.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament===
The ship's main armament consisted of eight 42-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|BL 15-inch Mk I guns]] in four twin hydraulically powered [[gun turret]]s designated 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' from bow to stern. When the turrets were modernised their maximum elevation was increased to +30°,&lt;ref name=r5&gt;Raven and Roberts, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; although the guns were loaded at +5°. They fired {{convert|1938|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2458|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; this provided a maximum range of {{convert|33550|yd|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pp. 25, 27&quot;&gt;Campbell, pp. 25, 27&lt;/ref&gt; These guns were also capable of firing the same projectiles while using supercharges which gave a maximum range of {{convert|37870|yd|m}}. Their rate of fire was two rounds per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, pp. 25, 27&quot;/&gt; ''Vanguard'' carried 100 shells per gun.&lt;ref name=r9&gt;Raven and Roberts, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15-inch turrets had been designed when the customary practice was to place the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] above the shell room, and it was not cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement adopted after the [[Battle of Jutland]] demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

The secondary armament consisted of sixteen 50-calibre [[QF 5.25 inch gun|QF 5.25-inch Mk I*]] [[dual purpose gun]]s in eight twin gun mounts.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt; They had a maximum depression of −5° and a maximum elevation of 70°. They fired an {{convert|80|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[British ordnance terms#HE|high-explosive]] shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2672|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The improved 5.25 turrets on ''Vanguard'' were claimed to be fully automatic, with a power-rammed breech and automatic tracking and elevation under radar control enabling a rate of fire was about 18 rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; At maximum elevation, the guns had a maximum range of {{convert|24070|yd|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 44, 46&lt;/ref&gt; 391 rounds were provided for each gun.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;

Short-range air defence was provided by 73 [[Bofors 40 mm]] AA guns in a variety of mountings. ''Vanguard'' had ten sextuple-barrel power-operated mounts concentrated in the superstructure and stern, a twin-barrel mount on 'B' turret, and 11 power-operated single mounts on the upper deck and rear superstructure.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt; All mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of +90°. The {{convert|40|mm|1|adj=on}} gun fired a {{convert|1.97|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2890|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a distance of {{convert|10,750|yd|m}}. The gun's rate of fire was approximately 120 rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 67, 71&lt;/ref&gt; Space was not available to stow the standard allowance of 1564 rounds per gun, and ''Vanguard'' only carried 1269 rounds per gun.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the single guns on the quarterdeck were removed in 1949 and five others during a major refit in 1954. All of her multiple Bofors mounts were removed at this same time.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire control===
''Vanguard'' was unique among British battleships in having [[British ordnance terms#RPC|remote power control]] (RPC) for her main, secondary and tertiary guns along with the [[Admiralty Fire Control Table]] Mk X for surface fire control of the main armament. There were two [[List of British ordnance terms#DCT|director control towers]] (DCT) for the 15-inch guns, each carrying a &quot;double cheese&quot; [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 274|Type 274]] fire-control radar for range finding and spotting the fall of shot. Each DCT could control all four turrets while 'B' turret could control 'A' and 'X' turrets. 'X' turret could only control 'Y' turret. There were four American Mark 37 DCTs for the 5.25-inch guns, each carrying the twin domes of [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 275|Type 275]] gunnery radar. Lastly, each Mark VI sextuple 40&amp;nbsp;mm Bofors mounting was provided with a separate CRBF (&quot;close range blind fire&quot;) [[director (military)|director]] fitted with a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 262|Type 262]] radar, although the ship never mounted her complete outfit of those directors. The STAAG Mk II 40&amp;nbsp;mm Bofors mounting carried its own Type 262 on the mounting itself. Other radar sets carried were Type 960 air and surface search, [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 293|Type 293]] target indication and [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 277|Type 277]] height finding.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, pp. 325, 327–28, 336–37&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 15-inch gun turrets were modernised, their existing {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on|1}} [[rangefinder]]s were replaced by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on|1}} ones in all turrets except for 'A' and they were fitted for RPC in azimuth only. The turrets were also provided with de-humidifying equipment and insulation to improve their habitability.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

===Protection===
[[File:HMSVanguardSternView.jpg|thumb|Rear quarter view of ''Vanguard'' showing her transom stern]]
The ship's armour scheme was based on that of the ''King George V'' class with a thinner [[waterline]] belt and additional splinter protection.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the belt armour was equal to that of the older ships, but it had to be reduced to offset weight increases when the design was modified to reflect wartime experience. The [[waterline]] {{convert|460|ft|m|1|adj=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, pp. 283–84, 292&lt;/ref&gt; main belt was composed of [[Krupp cemented armour]] (KCA) {{convert|13|in|mm|0}} thick, but increased to {{convert|14|in|mm|0}} abreast the magazines. It was {{convert|24|ft|m|1}} high and tapered to a thickness of {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} at the bottom edge of the belt. Fore and aft of the {{convert|12|in|mm|0|adj=on}} transverse bulkheads that closed off the central citadel, the belt continued almost to the ends of the ship. Forward it tapered to a thickness of {{convert|2|in}} and a height of {{convert|8|ft|1}} and aft to the same thickness, but a height of {{convert|11|ft|1}}. At the aft end of the steering gear compartment was a {{convert|4|in|adj=on}} transverse bulkhead. After the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]] in 1941, {{convert|1.5|in|adj=on}} non-cemented armour bulkheads were added on the sides of the magazines, to protect them from splinters from any hits from plunging shells, that might have penetrated the ship's side beneath her belt.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;&lt;ref name=g3&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

When the gun turrets from the [[World War I]]-era battlecruisers were modernised, their KCA faceplates were replaced by new ones 13&amp;nbsp;inches thick, and their roofs were replaced by {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} non-cemented armour plates. Their sides remained {{convert|7|–|9|in}} in thickness. The [[barbette]]s for the 15-inch guns were 13&amp;nbsp;inches thick on the sides, but tapered to {{convert|11|–|12|in|0}} closer to the centreline of the ship. The side and roof armour of the 5.25-inch turrets was {{convert|2.5|in}} thick. Their ammunition hoists were protected by armour {{convert|2|–|6|in|0}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, pp. 322, 339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

Intended to resist the impact of a {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} armour-piercing bomb dropped from a height of {{convert|14000|ft}}, ''Vanguard''{{'}}s deck protection was identical to that of the ''King George V'' class. It consisted of six-inch non-cemented armour over the magazines that reduced to {{convert|5|in|0}} over the machinery spaces. The armour continued forward and aft of the citadel at the lower-deck level. Forward it tapered in steps from five inches down to 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches near the bow. Aft, it protected the steering gear and propeller shafts with 4.5&amp;nbsp;inches of armour before tapering to a thickness of 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches near the stern. Unlike the Germans, French and Americans, the British no longer believed that heavy armour for the conning tower served any real purpose given that the chance of hitting it was very small; ''Vanguard''{{'}}s conning tower was therefore protected with {{convert|3|in|0}} of armour on the face and 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches on the sides and rear. The secondary conning tower aft had {{convert|2|in|0}} of armour on its sides.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;&lt;ref name=g3/&gt;

''Vanguard''{{'}}s underwater protection was enhanced when she was redesigned in 1942 to reflect the lessons learned when ''Prince of Wales'' was sunk by Japanese [[torpedo bomber]]s. It still consisted of a three-layer system of voids and liquid-filled compartments meant to absorb the energy of an underwater explosion. It was bounded on the inside by the {{convert|1.75|–|1.5|in|adj=on}} [[torpedo bulkhead]]. Her enlarged oil tanks reduced the empty spaces that could flood and cause the ship to [[list (watercraft)|list]] and greater provision was made to pump these spaces out. The longitudinal bulkheads of the side protection system were raised one deck higher to further subdivide the spaces behind the waterline armour belt. The side protection system had a maximum depth of {{convert|15|ft|1}}, but this decreased significantly as the ship narrowed at its ends. Over the length of the citadel, this system was found to be proof against {{convert|1000|lb}} of [[TNT (explosive)|TNT]] during full-scale trials.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, pp. 328–29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, pp. 294–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Vanguard'' was laid down on 2 October 1941 by [[John Brown and Company]] of [[Clydebank]], [[Scotland]], with the yard number of 567.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya]] in December, the ship was given an A1 priority in the hope of finishing her by the end of 1944 and construction of the [[light cruiser]] [[HMS Blake (C99)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], as well as some merchant shipping, was halted to expedite the ship's completion. This was unsuccessful, however, due to a shortage of skilled labour.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, pp. 322, 325&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it was not until 30 November 1944 that the ship was launched. [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] presided over this ceremony, the first ship she ever launched,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2114386_2114388_2115566,00.html |title=86 Surprising Facts About Queen Elizabeth II |last=Chakelian |first=Anoosh |date=15 May 2012 |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was presented with a diamond rose brooch to commemorate the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Vanguard Rose Brooch |url=http://queensjewelvault.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/the-vanguard-rose-brooch.html |publisher=From Her Majesty's Jewel Vault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[William Gladstone Agnew]] assumed command on 15 October 1945. The end of hostilities following Japan's surrender reduced the need for new warships, and consequently the ship was not commissioned until 12 May 1946.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 9, 13&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, a total of £11,530,503, including £3,186,868 for the modernisation of the main armament, had been spent on producing ''Vanguard''.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;

[[File:HelicopterLandingVanguardlarge.jpg|thumb|The R-5 coming in to land on the ship's [[foc'sle]]]]
After commissioning, the ship spent several months conducting sea trials and training until August, when she began the necessary modifications to serve as a [[royal yacht]] for the forthcoming royal tour of South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCart13&quot;&gt;McCart, pp. 13–14, 16, 20–21, 26, 29, 32, 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pigott, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The Admiral's suite was reworked into accommodations for the Royal Family and their staff while the anti-aircraft mount on top of 'B' turret was replaced by a saluting platform. Agnew was promoted to rear-admiral with effect from 8 January 1947. The alterations were complete by December, and ''Vanguard'' made a shakedown cruise into the Central [[Atlantic]] and made a port visit to [[Gibraltar]] on the return voyage. Initially escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Orwell|G98|2}}, {{HMS|Obedient|G48|2}}, {{HMS|Offa|G29|2}}, {{HMS|Opportune|G80|2}}, and {{HMS|Rotherham|H09|2}}, the ship rendezvoused with the [[Home Fleet]] on 1 February 1947 to receive a 21-gun salute led by the battleships {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}} and {{HMS|Duke of York|17|2}}, and the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Implacable|R86|2}}. Later that morning, a [[Sikorsky R-4]] [[helicopter]] landed aboard to pick up mail and photographic film.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCart13&quot;/&gt;

''Vanguard'' arrived in [[Cape Town]] on 17 February, escorted by the South African frigates {{ship|HMSAS|Good Hope||2}}, {{ship|HMSAS|Transvaal||2}} and {{ship|HMSAS|Natal||2}} on the last leg of her voyage. While the Royal Family toured the country on the first visit by a reigning monarch to South Africa, the ship exercised with ships of the South African and Royal Navies stationed there and made port visits to a number of South African cities. She sailed for home on 22 April and made brief visits to [[Saint Helena]] and [[Ascension Island]] en route. ''Vanguard'' arrived in [[Portsmouth]] on 11 May, and Captain F. R. Parham relieved the newly promoted Agnew on 29 May. In July, the ship began an overhaul in [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]], which lasted until August 1948. While she was refitting, ''Vanguard'' was tasked to carry the Royal Family on a tour of Australia and New Zealand,&lt;ref name=&quot;McCart42&quot;&gt;McCart, pp. 42, 45–46, 48–49, 53–54, 56&lt;/ref&gt; planned for January 1949. On 31 August, she began a shakedown cruise to the Mediterranean and returned to Devonport on 12 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCart42&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigott78&quot;&gt;Pigott, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, ''Vanguard'' was considered, along with a number of other large warships, for conversion to carry [[anti-aircraft missile]]s, but nothing further was done along these lines.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Moore, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

George VI was now too ill for travel, and the Royal Tour was indefinitely postponed later that month. ''Vanguard'' became the flagship of [[Admiral]] Sir [[Arthur Power]], Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, on 1 March 1949, and the ship made port visits to Algeria, France, Italy, Cyprus, Libya, Lebanon, Greece and Egypt before she arrived back at Devonport on 21 July. The newly promoted Rear Admiral Parham was relieved by Captain G. V. Gladstone a week later. The ship then became the flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron under Rear Admiral [[Edward Evans-Lombe]] on 12 November. While returning from a brief training sortie to Gibraltar, ''Vanguard'' went to the aid of a small French merchantman whose cargo had shifted in a severe storm on 13 February 1950. The merchantman, {{SS|Boffa}}, was taken under tow and the cargo was redistributed. Once the storm had abated, ''Boffa'' was able to resume her voyage under her own power. ''Vanguard'' reached Weymouth Bay the following day. Later, in March, she fired the salute to [[Vincent Auriol]], the [[President of France]], during his [[state visit]] to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 54, 56, 60, 62–63, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS Vanguard (Battleship, 1946-1960)1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Vanguard'' at anchor]]
On 13 September 1950 Admiral Sir [[Philip Vian]] hoisted his flag as Commander in Chief, Home Fleet, on ''Vanguard'' and the ship joined the rest of Home Fleet on exercises with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and the Mediterranean Fleet. On 19 December, Vian transferred his flag to {{HMS|Indomitable|92|2}}. Nearly two months later, on 10 February 1951, the aircraft carrier collided with ''Vanguard'' as the carrier docked at Gibraltar. The hole in the battleship's stern was not serious, and Vian re-hoisted his flag in ''Vanguard'' shortly afterwards. After manoeuvres with ''Indomitable'', during which her aircraft &quot;sank&quot; the battleship, the ship made port visits in [[Genoa]] and [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] before returning for a brief refit in Devonport on 14 March. After completing her refit in May, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron under Rear Admiral R. M. Dick at the [[Isle of Portland]]. Four months later the admiral transferred his flag to the carrier {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} as ''Vanguard'' began another refit in preparation to again become the flagship of Home Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buckingham Palace]] announced in November that King George VI was planning to take a short cruise for his health aboard ''Vanguard'', which meant that her Admiral's suite again had to be modified to accommodate him and his staff. Captain [[John Litchfield (politician)|John Litchfield]] assumed command on 21 December while the ship was still refitting, but the King died on 6 February 1952 before he could make his cruise. A detachment from the ship participated in his funeral procession before she departed for her post-refit shakedown cruise on 22 February. After exercising with ''Implacable'', ''Indomitable'' and the fast [[minelayer]] {{HMS|Apollo|M01|2}}, ''Vanguard'' returned home on 29 March. She became flagship of Home Fleet again on 13 May when Admiral Sir [[George Creasy]] hoisted his flag. Due to manning and weight problems, ''Vanguard'' operated with many of her turrets unmanned and with ammunition carried for only two of the 15-inch turrets and only starshell ammunition for the 5.25-inch guns.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in exercises with the [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Dutch]] and American navies, before returning to Portsmouth for the holidays. Litchfield was relieved by Captain R. A. Ewing on 19 January 1953; the ship departed the next day for a brief refit at Gibraltar. After its completion on 2 March, the ship trained with several of the Royal Navy's carriers before arriving back at Portsmouth on 25 March. ''Vanguard'' participated in Queen Elizabeth's Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 15 June 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Souvenir Programme, ''Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953'', HMSO, Gale and Polden&lt;/ref&gt; The following September, she participated in NATO's [[Exercise Mariner]] in the [[Denmark Strait]].&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 70, 72, 74–75, 79, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral Sir [[Michael Denny]] replaced Creasy as Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, on 5 January 1954 and ''Vanguard'' participated in Exercise Medflex A with Dutch and French ships in March. During the rest of the year she participated in anti-submarine and anti-aircraft exercises as well as making port visits to [[Oslo]] and [[Kristiansand]] in Norway and [[Helsingborg]] in Sweden. She was inspected on 11 July by King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]] before returning home later that month. Denny struck his flag on 15 September, and ''Vanguard'' sailed to Devonport for a £220,000 refit 10 days later. The February 1955 Defence Estimates had intended her as the Home Fleet flagship with a role as a {{sclass-|Sverdlov|cruiser|2}} killer, but after the appointment of Earl Mountbatten in April 1955&lt;ref&gt;Grove, pp. 225–26&lt;/ref&gt; and with Antony Eden replacing Churchill as prime minister, the government decided instead to maintain two extra cruisers in the fleet, and ''Vanguard'' was placed in reserve when it was completed its 1955 refit; she subsequently became the flagship of the [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|Reserve Fleet]] when [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice Admiral]] [[Richard Onslow (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Onslow]] hoisted his flag on 28 November. While moored in [[Fareham|Fareham Creek]], during her time in the reserve fleet, waterline shots of ''Vanguard'' in Portsmouth Harbour were filmed for the title sequence of the 1957 comedy film ''[[Carry on Admiral]]''. Just before decommissioning, scenes for the 1960 film ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' were filmed aboard,&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 87, 90&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Vanguard'' being used to depict interiors of the bridges, Admiral's Quarters and gun turrets for ''Hood'', ''Bismarck'' and ''King George V''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigott78&quot;/&gt;

On 9 October 1959 the Admiralty announced that ''Vanguard'' would be scrapped, as she was considered obsolete and too expensive to maintain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigott78&quot;/&gt; She was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 7 June 1960 and sold to the [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain]] for £560,000. On 4 August 1960, when the ship was scheduled to be towed from Portsmouth to the breaker's yard at [[Faslane]], Scotland, the whole of the [[Southsea]] sea front was packed with people who came to see her off. As ''Vanguard'' was being towed towards the harbour entrance, she slewed across the harbour and ran aground near the Still &amp; West [[pub]]. She was pulled off by five [[tugboat]]s an hour later, and made her final exit from Portsmouth. Five days later she arrived at Faslane, and by mid-1962 the demolition process was complete; she was the last British battleship to be scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 90, 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

As a part of the scrapping process, sections of {{convert|150|mm|in|adj=mid|-thick}} steel plate were recovered from ''Vanguard'' and used for the shielding of the [[Whole Body Counter|whole body monitor]] at the Radiobiological Research Laboratory (now [[DSTL]]) at [[Alverstoke]], [[Gosport]] in [[Hampshire]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowling|first=Giles|title=From Land, Sea and Air|journal=Defence Management Journal|volume=31|url=http://www.defencemanagement.com/article.asp?id=200&amp;content_name=National%20Security%20and%20Resilience&amp;article=5132|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
