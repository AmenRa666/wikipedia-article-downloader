The '''FV&amp;nbsp;214 Conqueror''', also known as &quot;Tank, Heavy No. 1, 120 mm Gun, Conqueror&quot;&lt;ref&gt;No 2 for the Mark 2&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[heavy tank]] of the post-war era. It was developed as a response to the Soviet [[Iosif Stalin tank|Joseph Stalin IS-3]] heavy tanks; its 120&amp;nbsp;mm gun&lt;ref name=&quot;wgt119&quot; /&gt; was larger than the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder]] (83.4&amp;nbsp;mm) gun carried by its peer, the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]]. The Conqueror's role was to provide long range anti-tank support for the Centurion. Conquerors were issued at nine for each regiment in Germany, usually grouped in three tank troops.

==Design and development==
The chassis was from the A45 Infantry Support Tank, which project was started in 1944 shortly after that of the A41 Centurion. After the war, the project was relocated to that of the &quot;Universal Tank&quot; design of the FV&amp;nbsp;200 series. The 200 series was to have used a common hull for all uses ([[self-propelled artillery]], [[armoured personnel carrier]], three varieties of tank, etc.). One tank type was to be the heavy FV&amp;nbsp;201 of 55&amp;nbsp;tonnes, armed with an 83.4&amp;nbsp;mm gun.

In 1949, it was decided to bring the armament up to 120&amp;nbsp;mm. As this delayed the project, in 1952 the FV&amp;nbsp;201 hull was combined with a [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder|17&amp;nbsp;pounder]]-armed Centurion Mk 2 turret to give the '''FV&amp;nbsp;221 Caernarvon Mark I'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nd8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q3YzT6TaKu2o0AHgjvW_Ag&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Huge Tank Developed by British May Be Most Powerful Ever.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1954, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one were built with the Mk III [[QF 20 pounder|20&amp;nbsp;pounder]] turret as the Caernarvon Mk II. The FV&amp;nbsp;221 may originally have been intended to be the &quot;Main Battle Tank&quot; member of the FV&amp;nbsp;201 series, but with the success of the A41 Centurion such a vehicle was no longer required. In either event, the Caernarvon was only used for chassis development work serving in troop trials. In 1955, the first Conqueror was produced. Twenty Mark 1 and 165 Mark 2 Conquerors were built, including conversions of Caernarvon MkIIs. Production continued until 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;wgt119&quot; /&gt; It lost much tactical relevance once the Centurion was upgraded to an [[Royal Ordnance L7|L7 105&amp;nbsp;mm gun]].

The new, larger-calibre gun design was American, the same as used on the US [[M103 heavy tank]];&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunstan, Centurion|Dunstan, Centurion]], p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; with separate charge and projectile, as would also be the case in the [[Chieftain tank|Chieftain]] that followed. The charge was not bagged but in a brass cartridge, which offered some safety advantages, but reduced shell capacity to 35.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, pages 14 and 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Conqueror_cupola,_Bovington_Tank_Museum.jpg|thumb|left|The rotating cupola of the The Tank Museum's Conqueror]]
The armour was very heavy for the time, especially in the front, where it was seven inches (178&amp;nbsp;mm) in the horizontal plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;wgt119&quot; &gt;[[#Ford, World's Great Tanks|Ford, World's Great Tanks]], p.&amp;nbsp;119&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this, along with the weight of the huge turret required to house the large gun and the very large hull volume, made the vehicle very heavy, giving it a relatively low top speed and making it mechanically unreliable. Also, few bridges could support its weight. However, rather like the [[World War II|Second World War]] [[Churchill tank]], the Conqueror had exceptional terrain handling characteristics and proved to be as capable cross country as the lighter (and on paper slightly faster) Centurion tank.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Griffin, Conqueror|Griffin, Conqueror]], p.&amp;nbsp;50&lt;/ref&gt;

One feature of particular note was the rotating commander's cupola, which was at the heart of the Conqueror's fire control system and was advanced for its time. The commander could align the cupola on a target independently of the turret, measure the range with a [[coincidence rangefinder]], and then direct the gunner on to the new lay mechanically indicated to him by the cupola. In theory, when the gunner traversed to the new lay, he would find the target already under his sights, ready to be engaged. Meanwhile, the commander was free to search for the next target. (The Soviet bloc also used similar devices, such as the TPKU-2 and TKN-3, on all of their post–World War II tanks, though theirs did not use a rangefinder.)

In the United Kingdom, Conqueror tanks are displayed at [[The Tank Museum]], Bovington,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tankmuseum.org/ixbin/indexplus?_IXSS_=_IXMENU_%3dVehicles%26ALL%3dchieftain%26_IXACTION_%3dsummary%26%252asform%3d%252fsearch_form%252fbovtm_combined%26TYPE%3darticle%26_IXFPFX_%3dtemplates%252fsummary%252f&amp;_IXFIRST_=7&amp;_IXSPFX_=templates/full/tvod/t&amp;_IXMAXHITS_=1&amp;submit-button=summary&amp;_IXSESSION_=&amp;_IXMENU_=Vehicles Museum accession record]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Land Warfare Hall of the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]]. Other tanks are in the collections of the [[Musée des Blindés]] in France, the Royal Museum of the Army in [[Brussels]] and the [[Kubinka Tank Museum]], Russia. One is privately owned in the United States as part of the [[Littlefield Collection]].

There are also two MkII ARVs at the Military History Museum on the Isle of Wight in an unrestored condition. A MkII ARV is held by the [[REME Museum of Technology]], although it is not on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; There was formerly a Conqueror [[gate guardian]] at Base Vehicle Depot [[Ludgershall, Wiltshire|Ludgershall]] - informally known as &quot;William&quot;. It is now part of the Isle of Wight Military Museum.

A Conqueror ARV remained in service at the Amphibious Experimental Establishment AXE, at Instow in North Devon, UK. It was used for beach tank recovery practise.

At least one Conqueror exists in poor condition on the grounds of the former Kirkcudbright Training Area in Scotland, where it was used as a gunnery target.

A number of Conquerors remain on the Haltern Training area in Germany.
