The '''''Balikpapan'' class''' is a [[ship class]] of eight heavy [[landing craft]] (officially Landing Craft, Heavy or LCH). All eight were originally laid down by [[Walkers Limited]] for the [[Australian Army]] in the early 1970s. A reorganisation of watercraft responsibilities in the Australian military meant the landing craft were to be operated by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN), with seven commissioned directly into RAN service during 1973 and 1974, and lead ship {{HMAS|Balikpapan|L 126|2}} transferred from the army to the navy. During the leadup to the [[History of Papua New Guinea#Independence|independence of Papua New Guinea]] in 1975, two of the vessels ([[HMPNGS Salamaua|''Salamaua'']] and [[HMPNGS Buna|''Buna'']]) were transferred to the new [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force]] (PNGDF).

During their careers, the Australian vessels have operated in support of [[Operation Navy Help Darwin]] in 1974–75, [[Operation Bel Isi]] from 1997 to 2003, [[INTERFET]] operations in 1999 and 2000, and [[RAMSI]] operations from 2003.

The six remaining RAN vessels were [[paid off]] in the 2010s: ''Balikpapan'', {{HMAS|Betano|L 133|2}}, and {{HMAS|Wewak|L 130|2}} in 2012; {{HMAS|Brunei|L 127|2}}, {{HMAS|Labuan|L 128|2}}, and {{HMAS|Tarakan|L 129|2}} in 2014. They are yet to be replaced in RAN service. As of 2013, the two PNGDF vessels were active, and in 2014, the former ''Labuan'' was transferred to Papua New Guinea as the training ship [[HMPNGS Lakekamu|''Lakekamu'']]. ''Brunei'' and ''Tarakan'' were refitted and donated to the [[Philippine Navy]] in 2015, commissioning as [[BRP Ivatan (AT-298)|''Ivatan'']] and [[BRP Batak (AT-299)|''Batak'']].  Three additional units of the class - decommissioned units former HMAS Balikpapan, HMAS Wewak and HMAS Betano - were loaded on a transport ship in March 2016 for transport to the Philippine Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.update.ph/2016/03/heavy-lift-firm-delivers-3-australian-landing-crafts-to-philippines/3502|title=Heavy lift firm delivers 3 Australian Landing Crafts to Philippines|work=Update Philippines|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and capabilities==
[[File:M-113 LCH (USMC).jpg||thumb|left||upright|[[M-113]] armoured personnel carriers disembarking on a beach from a ''Balikpapan''-class landing craft]]
Eight new heavy [[landing craft]] were ordered in 1969 as a locally manufactured replacement for the [[Australian Army]]'s four [[LSM-1-class landing ship medium]] and two [[ALC 50]] landing craft after the [[Landing Ship Medium Mark II]] project was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Gillett, ''Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946'', pgs 79, 125&lt;/ref&gt; They are {{convert|44.5|m}} long, with a beam of {{convert|10.1|m}}, and a draught of {{convert|2|m}}.&lt;ref name=Jane12p32&gt;Saunders (ed.), ''IHS Jane's Fighting Ships 2012–2013'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The [[landing craft]] have a standard displacement of 320 tons, with a full load displacement of 517 tons.&lt;ref name=Jane12p32/&gt; They were originally built with two General Motors Detroit 6–71 diesel motors.&lt;ref name=Wertheim26&gt;Wertheim (ed.), ''The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; These were replaced by Caterpillar 3406E diesel engines between 2005 and 2007 for those still in Australian service.&lt;ref name=Jane12p32/&gt; The standard ship's company is 16-strong, including two officers.&lt;ref name=Jane12p32/&gt; The sensor suite is limited to a Racel Decca Bridgemaster I-band navigational radar.&lt;ref name=Jane12p32/&gt; They are fitted with two {{convert|7.62|mm|adj=on}} machine guns for self-defence.&lt;ref name=Wertheim26/&gt;

The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to three [[Leopard 1]] or two [[M1A1 Abrams]] tanks, 13 [[M113 armored personnel carrier]]s, 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four [[LARC-V]] amphibious cargo vehicles.&lt;ref name=Wertheim26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillett79&gt;Gillett, ''Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946'', p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GillettAusNav30&gt;Gillett, ''Australia's Navy'', Part 2, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; As a troop transport, a ''Balikpapan'' class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages.&lt;ref name=Gillett79/&gt;&lt;ref name=NavalTech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/balikpapanclasslch/|title=Balikpapan Class Heavy Landing Craft (LCH), Australia|date=2014|website=Naval Technology|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2014}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel's payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of {{convert|1300|nmi}}, which increases to {{convert|2280|nmi}} with a 150-ton payload, and {{convert|3000|nmi}} when unladen.&lt;ref name=Wertheim26/&gt; The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages.&lt;ref name=Gillett79/&gt; The LCHs can mate their bow ramp to the stern loading dock of the RAN's large amphibious warfare ships when operating in the ship-to-shore role.&lt;ref name=NavalTech/&gt;

All eight ''Balikpapan''-class vessels were constructed by [[Walkers Limited]] at their shipyard in [[Maryborough, Queensland]].&lt;ref name=Wertheim25&gt;Wertheim (ed.), ''The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; All were laid down during 1971 and 1972, with lead ship {{HMAS|Balikpapan|L 126|2}} entering service with the [[Australian Army Water Transport Squadron]] at the end of 1971.&lt;ref name=Wertheim25/&gt; After this, responsibility for seagoing Army craft was transferred to the RAN, with the other seven craft directly entering naval service during 1973 and 1974, and ''Balikpapan'' transferring over in late 1974.&lt;ref name=Wertheim25/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillett80&gt;Gillett, ''Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==

===Australian service===
{{expand section|date=January 2015|reason=Should include information on Australian Army transport and support, participation in exercises (such as [[Talisman Sabre]]), and hydrographic surveying (including [[Operation Beachcomber]])}}
[[File:ISF troops landing on Timor beach.jpg|thumb|Australian troops landing in [[East Timor]] 2006, using the ''HMAS Balikpapan'']]
In January 1973, the ''Balikpapan''s in RAN service were formed together as the First Australian Landing Craft Squadron, based at {{HMAS|Moreton}} in Brisbane.&lt;ref name=Gillett79/&gt; In November 1974, {{HMAS|Salamaua|L 131|2}} and {{HMAS|Buna|L 132|2}} were transferred to the fledgling [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force]], along with five [[Attack-class patrol boat|''Attack''-class]] patrol boats.&lt;ref name=Gillett79/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frame261&gt;Frame, ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Five of the remaining Australian LCHs were deployed in December 1974 following [[Cyclone Tracy]] as part of [[Operation Navy Help Darwin]]; {{HMAS|Labuan|L 128|6}} was undergoing refits at the time.&lt;ref name=Swinden22&gt;Swinden, ''Heavy Lifting for Four Decades'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

{{HMAS|Labuan|L 128|6}} was assigned to the [[Royal Australian Navy Reserve]] in June 1979, and attached to the Brisbane Port Division.&lt;ref name=Gillett79/&gt; Three LCHs, {{HMAS|Tarakan|L 129|2}}, ''Balikpapan'', and {{HMAS|Wewak|L 130|2}} were placed in reserve at [[NQEA Australia|NQEA]] in Cairns during August and September 1985.&lt;ref name=Gillett79/&gt; They were reactivated in 1988, 1990, and 2000, respectively.&lt;ref name=Wertheim26/&gt; On entering service, {{HMAS|Brunei|L 127|2}} and {{HMAS|Betano|L 133|2}} initially supplemented the inshore [[hydrographic survey]] capabilities of the RAN until late 1988, when they were reassigned to the naval base {{HMAS|Waterhen|naval base|6}} for use in diver training.&lt;ref name=Wertheim26/&gt; During May and June 1984, ''Balikpapan'' completed a {{convert|5,400|nmi|adj=on}} transit from Brisbane to Penang, transporting vehicles, equipment, and personnel to [[RAAF Butterworth]]; the longest ocean voyage undertaken by a vessel of this class.&lt;ref name=Swinden22/&gt;
[[File:Two Australian LCHs and an US Army LCU in 2011.jpg|thumb|left|''Balikpapan'' (left), ''Wewak'', and a United States Navy [[Landing Craft Utility]] underway during [[Pacific Partnership]] 2011]]

Between 1997 and 2003, the LCHs were used to support the [[Peace Monitoring Group]] (PMG) in [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], under [[Operation Bel Isi]].&lt;ref name=Swinden23&gt;Swinden, ''Heavy Lifting for Four Decades'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Ships deployed on this operation were involved in resupplying the PMG base in [[Loloho]], transport of PMG personnel and humanitarian aid, and coastal patrols.&lt;ref name=Swinden23/&gt; From 1999 onwards, the ''Balikpapan''s were also tasked with supporting [[INTERFET]] operations in [[East Timor]], particularly those relating to the [[Oecusse District|Oecussi enclave]].&lt;ref name=Swinden23/&gt; The increase in operational tempo was a major factor in the reactivation of ''Wewak'' in 2000.&lt;ref name=Swinden23/&gt; In 2003, the landing craft began supporting [[RAMSI]] operations in the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref name=Swinden23/&gt;

On 11 December 2012, ''Wewak'' was decommissioned.&lt;ref name=WewakDODdecom&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/defencenews/stories/2012/dec/1211a.htm |title=HMAS Wewak decommissioned |date=11 December 2012 |publisher=Department of Defence |accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Balikpapan'' and ''Betano'' were both decommissioned a day later, on 12 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/news/hma-ships-balikpapan-and-betano-decommissioned |title=HMA Ships Balikpapan and Betano decommissioned |date=13 December 2012 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-balikpapan |title=HMAS Balikpapan |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-betano |title=HMAS Betano |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other three Australian vessels were decommissioned on 20 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=RAN to decommission three Balikpapan-class LCHs |url=http://www.janes.com/article/41154/ran-to-decommission-three-balikpapan-class-lchs |last=Rahmat |first=Ridzwan |date=23 July 2014 |accessdate=3 September 2014 |work=IHS Jane's Navy International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final farewell for landing craft&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Staples |first1=Natalie |title=Final farewell for landing craft |url=http://news.navy.gov.au/en/Nov2014/Fleet/1616#.VG20JPmUf_E |website=Navy Daily |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=20 November 2014 |date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papua New Guinea===
As part of the leadup to the [[History of Papua New Guinea#Independence|independence of Papua New Guinea]], in November 1974, {{HMAS|Salamaua|L 131|2}} and {{HMAS|Buna|L 132|2}} were transferred to the fledgling [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force]], along with five [[Attack-class patrol boat|''Attack''-class]] patrol boats.&lt;ref name=Gillett79/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frame261&quot;/&gt;

During 1985 and 1986, ''Salamaua'' and ''Buna'' underwent refits.&lt;ref name=Wertheim536&gt;Wertheim (ed.), ''The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World'', p. 536&lt;/ref&gt;

The two PNG vessels were listed in ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]'' as non-operational since 2011, and awaiting refits.&lt;ref name=Jane12p602&gt;Saunders (ed.), ''IHS Jane's Fighting Ships 2012–2013'', p. 602&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, they had been returned to service.&lt;ref name=Swinden21&gt;Swinden, ''Heavy Lifting for Four Decades'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; ''Labuan'' and ''Tarakan'' delivered humanitarian supplies to remote coastal settlements in the Solomon Islands in September 2014 as part of Australian support efforts in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=18 September 2014|title=Australian Navy Delivers Supplies to Solomon Islands |url=http://navaltoday.com/2014/09/18/australian-navy-delivers-supplies-to-solomon-islands/|newspaper=Naval Today|location= |accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After decommissioning from Australian service, ''Labuan'' was transferred to the PNGDF for use as a training vessel, and was commissioned as [[HMPNGS Lakekamu|HMPNGS ''Lakekamu'']] on 4 December 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final farewell for landing craft&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Defence Minister welcomes the commissioning of HMPNGS Lakekamu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Defence Minister welcomes the commissioning of HMPNGS Lakekamu|url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/2014/12/04/minister-for-defence-defence-minister-welcomes-the-commissioning-of-hmpngs-lakekamu-4-december-2014/|website=Media release|publisher=Senator David Johnston|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===

Instead, the Philippine Navy took possession of the vessels at {{HMAS|Cairns|naval base|6}} on 23 July, with ''Brunei'' commissioned as [[BRP Ivatan (AT-298)|BRP ''Ivatan'']] and ''Tarakan'' commissioned as [[BRP Batak (AT-299)|BRP ''Batak'']].&lt;ref name=romero27July&gt;{{cite news |last1=Romero |first1=Alexis |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/23/1480143/navy-commissions-2-landing-craft-heavy-ships-australia |title=Navy commissions 2 landing craft heavy ships from Australia |publisher=philstar.com (The Philippine Star) |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two landing craft sailed that day for the Philippines, with a formal christening ceremony to be held following their arrival in early August.&lt;ref name=Romero13July&gt;{{cite news |last1=Romero |first1=Alexis |title=Navy to commission 2 landing craft heavy ships from Australia |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/12/1476279/navy-commission-2-landing-craft-heavy-ships-australia |accessdate=13 July 2015 |work=philstar.com (The Philippine Star)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the vessels will likely be homeported on the island of [[Palawan]].&lt;ref name=Rahmat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rahmat|first1=Ridzwan|title=Philippines edges closer to Australian landing craft procurement|url=http://www.janes.com/article/53270/philippines-edges-closer-to-australian-landing-craft-procurement|accessdate=5 August 2015|work=IHS Jane's 360|date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine and Australian governments are in negotiations to sell the three remaining Australian ''Balikpapan''s to the Philippine Navy, with a deal expected to be reached later in 2015.&lt;ref name=Dalton/&gt; On 27 July 2015, Philippines president [[Benigno Aquino III]] stated as part of his annual state of the nation address that his government intended to purchase all three vessels.&lt;ref name=Rahmat/&gt; All three, the former HMAS ''Balikpapan'', HMAS ''Wewak'', and HMAS ''Betano'', were delivered to the Philippines on March 2016, and were immediately sent for refurbishing works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Aben |first1=Elena |title=PH Navy gets three ships from Australia |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/three-newly-acquired-navy-vessels-arrive-in-the-ph/ |accessdate=2016-05-31 |work=Manila Bulletin |date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will be commissioned to the Philippine Navy on June 1, 2016 as BRP ''Waray'' (LC-288), BRP ''Iwak'' (LC-289), and BRP ''Agta'' (LC-290), and will be assigned to the Sealift Amphibious Force. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mangosing |first1=Frances |title=PH Navy to commission 4 more ships |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/788378/ph-navy-to-commission-4-ships |accessdate=2016-05-31 |work=Inquirer.net |date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement==
There are plans to replace the ''Balikpapan''s in Australian service with an as-yet-unidentified class of six heavy landing craft.&lt;ref name=WewakDODdecom/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NN-06-12-12&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=End of the line |last=Berry |first=Paul |date=6 December 2012 |work=Navy News |publisher=Directorate of Defence News |page=4 |accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original replacement project was not due to decide on the design until between 2016 and 2018, with the new class to enter service from 2022.&lt;ref name=GillettAusNav30/&gt; The Department of Defence issued a [[request for information]] in early 2011, which may lead to the project being brought forward.&lt;ref name=GillettAusNav30/&gt;
