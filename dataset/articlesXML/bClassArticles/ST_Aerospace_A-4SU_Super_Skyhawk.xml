The '''ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk''' is a major upgrade project of the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk#Variants|Douglas A-4S Skyhawk]] attack aircraft undertaken by '''Singapore Aircraft Industries''' (SAI, now [[ST Aerospace]]) in the 1980s. It was used exclusively by the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] (RSAF), serving in the [[fighter-bomber]] role from 1989 until retirement from front line service in 2005. Since mid-1999, the A-4SU took on the additional role of being the designated [[Trainer (aircraft)#Advanced training|Advanced jet trainer (AJT)]] aircraft for the RSAF's AJT training program/detachment in Cazaux, France.&lt;ref name=Cazaux&gt;[http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/resources/speeches/2002/24jul02_speech.html &quot;Inauguration of the 150 Squadron Building in Cazaux Air Base, France.&quot;] ''[[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Singaporean Ministry of Defence]]'', 24 July 2002.

==Design and development==

===A-4S and TA-4S===
Starting in 1973, the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] (RSAF) began to acquire [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]]s. The first batch of over 50 airframes (ex-[[US Navy]] A-4Bs) was ordered and was subsequently requisitioned from the [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group|Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center]] (MASDC) at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base|Davis-Monthan AFB]], Arizona which was released to the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] Aircraft Service (LAS) Company at [[Ontario, California]] and its subsidiary Lockheed Aircraft Service Singapore (LASS) at [[Seletar Airfield]], [[Singapore]] for a major overhaul and refurbishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGC1&quot;&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%200647.html &quot;Singapore Servicing.&quot;] ''[[Flight International]]'', 1972 (archived at ''[[Flightglobal.com]]'' ([[Reed Business Information]]). Retrieved: 4 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TA-4SU Skyhawk cockpits.jpg|thumb|left|Stepped cockpit layout of a TA-4SU. The row of [[vortex generator]]s on the drooped [[leading edge slats]] and the [[ram-air intake]] mounted on the portside for engine cooling, are unique to the TA-4SU. The [[Chrome plating|chrome-plated]] muzzle brake of the Colt Mk.12 cannon is also visible.]]

These aircraft would later emerge as the A-4S single-seater (44 airframes) and the TA-4S two-seat trainer (three airframes), all having more than 100 changes incorporated (these included a slightly longer nose to house a new avionics package, five stores [[hardpoint]]s instead of the usual three, a saddle style [[Radio direction finder#ADF|Automatic Direction Finder]] dorsal hump, [[cockpit]] [[Vehicle armour|armour plating]], [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]]s, a cranked [[Aerial refueling#Probe and drogue|refueling probe]], [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] capability, a [[Drogue parachute|brake parachute]] housing below the jetpipe into the standard A-4B airframes. As with the Israeli A-4Hs which were armed with a pair of [[30 mm caliber|30 mm]] [[DEFA cannon]]s, these were similarly armed with the {{Convert|30|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[ADEN cannon]]s in place of the original [[20 mm caliber|20 mm]] [[Colt Mk 12 cannon]]s. A later order of four two-seat trainer airframes was placed in 1976, and these joined the RSAF in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frawley&quot;&gt;Frawley 2002, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TA-4S trainers were not the standard TA-4 with a common cockpit for the student and instructor pilot, but were instead rebuilt by Lockheed with a {{convert|28|in|mm|adj=on}} fuselage plug inserted into the front fuselage and a separate bulged cockpit (giving better all round visibility) for the instructor seated behind the student pilot. This arrangement was unique for the RSAF but was not the first by Lockheed (the Lockheed [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71B]] and [[Lockheed U-2|TU-2S trainers]] also used stepped cockpits). As such converted/rebuilt airframes, these TA-4S trainers were powered by the original [[Wright J65]] turbojet engines as used in the B/C models instead of the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney J52]] used by the purpose-built TA-4E/Fs tandem-seaters from Douglas assembly line; this was the main reason why the RSAF decided to not procure the TA-4E/Fs (if indeed an order was placed) and then having to maintain two different engines to power essentially the same aircraft type (a scenario not unlike having a fleet within a fleet).&lt;ref name=&quot;Frawley&quot;/&gt;

All of the single-seaters were later retired when the upgraded A-4SU began to enter service, the twin-seaters were upgraded instead and remained in service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frawley&quot;/&gt;

===A-4S-1 and TA-4S-1===
A second batch of 70 airframes was ordered (mix of ex-US Navy A-4Bs and A-4Cs) in 1980, these were shipped directly to Singapore for rebuilding with the A-4Cs being rebuilt as the A-4S-1s while the A-4Bs was to remain in storage for use as spares. Along with a small number of TA-4S-1s, these newer Skyhawks (characterised by its straight refueling probe instead of the cranked refueling probe found on the original '''A-4S/TA-4S''') would join the RSAF as attrition replacements from 1982. However, these airframes retained the original {{Convert|20|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} Colt Mk 12 cannons of the A-4Cs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frawley&quot;/&gt;

In 1983, a third order of 8 TA-4S saw 16 stored A-4Bs from the [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group|Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center]] ([[aircraft boneyard]]) being converted and rebuilt as the TA-4S-1 trainers (eight airframes).&lt;ref name=&quot;Frawley&quot;/&gt;

===A-4SU and TA-4SU Super Skyhawk===
[[File:TA-4SU mock up Singapore 1988.jpg|thumb|A full scale TA-4SU mock-up on display at the stand of Singapore Aircraft Industries (SAI) at the 1988 [[Asian Aerospace]] exhibition]]

In 1985, as a result of four A-4S being written off in separate accidents, coupled with the low serviceability of the original batch of A-4S. Investigations conducted by RSAF reveal that although there was plenty of fuselage life left, the Wright J65 turbojet engines in use by the Skyhawks was too old and the associated spare parts were becoming both difficult and expensive to obtain. Consequently, the RSAF decided to upgrade the '''A-4S/TA-4S''' rather than to replace them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frawley&quot;/&gt;

With SAI contracted as the main contractor for the upgrading project and a non-afterburning [[General Electric F404]]-GE-100D turbofan engine selected as the new engine, the upgrading project would later be extended to cover the entire fleet of newer '''A-4S-1'''s as well as taking the opportunity to completely modernise the avionics package (newly installed equipment now included a [[Pave Penny]] laser seeker mounted in the nose, an [[Inertial navigation system]] (INS), a [[Tactical Air Navigation]] (TACAN) system, fore &amp; aft [[Radar warning receiver]]s (RWR) and [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]]/[[Flare (countermeasure)|flare]] [[countermeasure]]s) of the aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frawley&quot;/&gt;

The modernised A-4SU and TA-4SU versions with its new F404 turbofan engine had 29% more thrust, which resulted in a 30% reduction in takeoff time as well as an increase in usable payload, range and maximum speed. The maximum speed now at sea level is {{convert|610|kn|lk=in}}, and maximum cruise speed at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} is {{convert|446|kn}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frawley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=A-4SU_data&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080329003734/http://www.skyhawk.org/2c/techdata.htm &quot;A-4 Technical data.&quot;] ''Skyhawk.org.'' Retrieved: 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==

By 1974, the RSAF received enough refurbished A-4S to form the [[142 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|142 Sqn]] and [[143 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|143 Sqn]], which were based at [[Tengah Air Base]] and [[Changi Air Base]], respectively. In RSAF service, the '''A-4S/TA-4S''' were given 3-digit serials starting with 6 (e.g. 600, 651).&lt;ref name=&quot;RSAF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a4skyhawk.org/2e/singapore/singapore.htm|title=Republic of Singapore Air Force|year=2012|publisher=a4skyhawk.org|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DISPLAY&quot;&gt;Also, please refer to section [[#Aircraft on display|&quot;Aircraft on display&quot;]] for additional reference.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1982 A-4S-1 and TA-4S-1 Skyhawks would join the RSAF as attrition replacements with the balance being allocated in 1984 to form a new unit - [[145 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|145 Sqn]] which was also based at Tengah Air Base. These were given 3-digit serial starting with 9 (e.g. 900, 929).&lt;ref name=&quot;RSAF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DISPLAY&quot;/&gt;

In total, approximately 150 airframes (all A-4Bs and Cs) were acquired by Singapore.&lt;ref name=&quot;A4S&quot;/&gt;

The modernised A-4SU Super Skyhawks were received by 143 Sqn first, followed by 142 Sqn and 145 Sqn of the RSAF from 1989 onwards. The type was also operated by the [[RSAF Black Knights]] aerobatic display team for precision aerial manoeuvers from 1990 to 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSAF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gail Wan|date=10 January 2008|title=RSAF Black Knights all ready to wow spectators at Singapore Airshow|journal=Pioneer|publisher=MINDEF|issn=0048-4199|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/cyberpioneer/news/2008/January/10jan08_news.html|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BKH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/assets/black_knights/history.html|title=Black Knights - History|date=24 April 2010|publisher=MINDEF|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of front-line service===

After 31 years of operations, the RSAF officially withdrew its fleet of A-4SU Super Skyhawks from operational combat service in Singapore on 31 March 2005. The A-4SU's achievements included flying directly from Singapore to the [[Philippines]], incorporating the RSAF's first air-to-air refueling mission in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/5kkmrUJMg &quot;RSAF's first air-to-air refuelling.&quot;] ''sg.geocities.com,'' 23 October 2009.

A month before its retirement, the Skyhawk squadron (145 Sqn) won the top honours in a strike exercise against its more modern F-16 and F-5 counterparts and emerged as the Top combat squadron in the [[Singapore Armed Forces Best Unit Competition]], an honour it has held since year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2000/jun/21jun00_nr2.html &quot;The SAF's Best Combat Units.&quot;] ''MINDEF,'' 21 June 2000.

In 1998, the [[France|French]] government offered the use of facilities at [[French Air Force#Southern Region|BA 120 Cazaux Air Base (France)]]. A 25-year lease for basing rights of 18 A-4SU aircraft and approximately 250 RSAF personnel and their families was signed later that year. Back in Singapore, 143 Sqn was disbanded in 1997, and its aircraft were handed over to [[150 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|150 Sqn]], which had given up its [[Aermacchi SF.260|SIAI Marchetti SF.260]] basic trainers.&lt;ref name=Cazaux/&gt; The new squadron then took up the role of advanced jet training, using its aircraft as a lead-in fighter trainer for RSAF pilots. This made it the prime candidate for moving to France, and the first of 18 aircraft were &quot;packed&quot; and sent to France by ship in mid-1999 as part of the RSAF's Advanced Jet Training Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2002/jul/24jul02_nr.html &quot;RADM (NS) Teo Inaugurates RSAF’s Advanced Jet Training Facilities at Cazaux.&quot;] ''MINDEF,'' 24 July 2002.
