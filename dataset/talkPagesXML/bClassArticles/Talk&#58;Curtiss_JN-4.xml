==Untitled==
Suggest merging into a single article on the Curtiss JN &quot;Jenny&quot; aircraft. The JN-2 and JN-3 were used operationally in Mexico during the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]]

:[[User:Vern Reisenleiter|Vern Reisenleiter]] 20:35, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

Personally, I am in favour of maintaining separate articles about each variant...[[User:Fawcett5|Fawcett5]] 03:29, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

I think it's appropriate to merge the articles.  They're essentially the same aircraft.  We don't have separate articles for the P51-A through -F.

Sorry, should have done this before. Here is the proposed [[User:Vern Reisenleiter/Sandbox|merged article]]. It gives a brief history of the JN series with emphasis on the JN-4. If there is no further objection, I will pull the two articles together on 5 Nov 2005. [[User:Vern Reisenleiter|Vern Reisenleiter]] 17:37, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

I would suggest the title of this be changed to Curtiss Jenny, or perhaps Curtiss JN--but JN4 is misleading.--Buckboard 07:43, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
== How to Fly a Jenny ==

Is this section really encyclopedic?  I can understand a link to it, with the description of &quot;popular bit of humour related to flying a Jenny&quot; or something like that, but I'm not certain why it's included in the article itself.  (And who exactly is the Sam Stites mentioned in it?) [[User:156.34.221.174|156.34.221.174]] 23:59, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

I've removed it for the time being.  Text is below, if anyone can think of a way to make it encyclopedic:

== How to fly a Jenny ==
Common bit of Jenny lore (from the 20s or 30s?); attributed to Sam Stites. Source: Several web sites; it is referenced at the Jenny display of the Seattle Museum of Flight.

'''1. Inspection:''' It is best not to inspect this ship. If you do, you will never get into it.

'''2. Climbing into the cockpit:''' Do not attempt to enter the cockpit in the usual way. If you put your weight on the lower wing panel, it will fall off, and besides, your foot will go through the wing, probably breaking your leg. The best way to enter the cockpit is to climb over the tail surfaces and crawl up the turtle back. Be sure to brush the gopher and squirrel nests out of the cockpit. Take care not to cut your hands on the remnants of the windshield.

'''3. Instruments:''' After having carefully lowered yourself into the seat and groped in vain for a safety belt, take a good look at the instruments; both of them. The one on the right is the tachometer. It doesn't work. The other one is an altimeter, and functioned perfectly until 1918, when the hand fell off. Look at them now, for after the engine starts you won't be able to.

'''4. Starting the motor:''' The switch is on the right; it is not connected.' However it gives a sense of Confidence to the mechanic who is pulling the prop through to hear the switch click when you say &quot;switch off&quot;. If for some reason the motor does start, don't get out to pick up the unconscious and bleeding mechanic, he deserved it.

'''5. Warming up:''' Don't warm up the engine. It will only run a few minutes anyway, and the longer it runs on the ground the less flying time you have. After the throttle is opened, do not expose any portion of your body outside the cockpit. It is no fun having your face slapped by a flying rocker arm, or being peppered with small bits of piston rings, valves, etc. that are continually coming out of the exhaust stacks.

'''6. The takeoff:''' The takeoff is in direct defiance of all the laws of nature. If you have a passenger, don't try it.

'''7. The flight:''' After you have dodged trees, windmills, and chimneys until you are over the lake, you will note a large hole in the left side of the fuselage. This hole is to allow the stick to be moved far enough to make a left turn. Don't try one to the right.

'''8. The landing:''' The landing is made in accordance with the laws of gravity. If the landing gear doesn't collapse on the first bounce, don't worry, it will on the second. After you have extricated yourself from the wreckage and helped the spectators put out the fire, light a cigarette, and with a nonchalant shrug walk disdainfully away.

==Another variant...here or seperate?==
The Curtiss N-9 was a seaplane variant of the JN-4, and is not yet covered in Wikipedia. I'm getting set to do an article on it, but would like input...because the airframe was fairly significantly modified, one could argue that it is different enough to cover it in a seperate article. Yet, there is also merit in keeping all the variants together in one place. Does anyone have opinions? [[User:Akradecki|Akradecki]] 05:24, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
:No response, so it'll get its own page, with a reference on this page. [[User:Akradecki|Akradecki]] 20:06, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

==Title change?==
Every reference external to this article, and even in the article text, the model is JN-4...with a dash. I see no reason the this article should be JN4 without a dash. It goes against standard usage, and WP articles are supposed to reflect the common, standard usage. If I don't hear any objections, I plan on moving the article to Curtiss JN-4.  [[User:Akradecki|Akradecki]] 05:29, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
:No response (I assume that means no one is actively watching this page), so I've made  the move. [[User:Akradecki|Akradecki]] 20:06, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

==Engine==
The article mentions several times that the engine in the Jenny was inline, but the article on the engine (the OX-5) linked from this article says that it was a V8.  Which is correct?  Or does inline refer to it being non-radial?  Just trying to clear it up for myself.

== Date formatting ==

This article is about a US aircraft. Per WP:MOS, the date formatting (Month/DD/YYYY) was established on [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Curtiss_JN-4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=259336429 December 21, 2008]. [[User:Centpacrr|Centpacrr]] ([[User talk:Centpacrr|talk]]) 13:49, 4 September 2011 (UTC)
:It's a military training aircraft. Enuf said. FWiW [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 15:18, 4 September 2011 (UTC).
::This was a military trainer but was used for most of the time as a civilian aircraft. Irrespective of that, however, the date formatting was established as Month/DD/YYYY on [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Curtiss_JN-4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=259336429 December 21, 2008] and you made many edits to this article afterwards without ever raising a question about it that formatting. With respect, Bill, your unilateral and arbitrary attempt to change this now clearly violates both the spirit and letter of WP:MOS, as well as contradicts the ''very argument'' you have used elsewhere (&quot;first major contributor&quot;) to justify your position on formatting in the ''Graf Zeppelin'' article as DD/Month/YYYY. You can't have it both ways. [[User:Centpacrr|Centpacrr]] ([[User talk:Centpacrr|talk]]) 15:31, 4 September 2011 (UTC)
:::Nope, many military aircraft go on to have a civilian life. FWiW, there is no change here, it's US, it's military, it uses the US military system. [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 15:40, 4 September 2011 (UTC).
::::*For the reasons stated above, this argument is diametrically opposed your own pervious position expressed elsewhere in discussion of the Zeppelin articles last week. I repeat, you really just can't have it both ways. 

::::*While the Jenny type was originally designed and produced as a trainer for the Army, it had a very much longer career as a civil aircraft. The date formatting of the article was established in 2008 as M/D/Y by its &quot;first major contributor&quot; (the very justification you give for changing the LZ 127 article from M/D/Y to D/M/Y), and you (and others) made many edits to it after that time without ''ever'' objecting to this formatting. With respect, Bill, your change in position now thus appears to be contrived and constitutes little more than Wikilawyering which is not supported by the MOS guidelines and is ultimately unhelpful. [[User:Centpacrr|Centpacrr]] ([[User talk:Centpacrr|talk]]) 16:21, 4 September 2011 (UTC)
:That's like saying the B-17 is now a civil aircraft because its history is longer as a crop duster. FWiW, I've been consistent, US- US-military (D/M/Y), US-civil (M/D/Y), other nations (Usually D/M/Y).  [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 16:44, 4 September 2011 (UTC).

== Images ==

This article now has a dozen images ''nine'' of which have been added in the last two days. That seems to me to be more than plenty for a article this size. [[User:Centpacrr|Centpacrr]] ([[User talk:Centpacrr|talk]]) 17:27, 6 September 2011 (UTC)
:Well it's now thirteen with ''ten'' added in the last two days as well as image stacking (see [[WP:STACKING]]). [[User:Centpacrr|Centpacrr]] ([[User talk:Centpacrr|talk]]) 17:33, 6 September 2011 (UTC)
::There are now ''fourteen'' images in this article. That's going the wrong direction. [[User:Centpacrr|Centpacrr]] ([[User talk:Centpacrr|talk]]) 22:16, 9 September 2011 (UTC)

&lt;center&gt;([[User_talk:Centpacrr/Archive5#Images_on_the_Curtiss_JN-4_article_.28Edited.29|*]])&lt;/small&gt;

The image with the caption &quot;The JN-4D on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force&quot; in the &quot;Operators&quot; section of the article is, in fact, one of the Standard J-1s displayed in Dayton (one can see the museum photos of the aircraft on the NMUSAF info page at &quot;http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=270&quot; with the third of three photos available on the page showing it hanging just as in the photo in this article).  When viewing a Jenny or Standard from the rear three-quarter view, as it is in this photo, one of the easiest ways to distinguish between the two types is where the front cockpit sits in relation to the rear cabane struts; the Standard's front &quot;hole&quot; is aft of the rearmost cabanes, while the Jenny's is ahead of the rearmost cabanes (in other words, the Jenny's front cockpit is positioned between the front and rear cabane struts under the wing center section).[[Special:Contributions/192.100.69.170|192.100.69.170]] ([[User talk:192.100.69.170|talk]]) 20:28, 2 May 2012 (UTC)  CBsHellcat

== Design and development-update/clarification on the origin of the N-series? ==

Has anyone seen any references to confirm that the N-series was derived from an Avro design?  If so, should the article be updated to note this?  Supposedly, the designer was Thomas, formerly of Sopwith, as noted in the article.
