==''Matsonia''==

A very minor note that the ship ''Matsonia'' (formerly [[SS Malolo]]) was indeed owned by the US government during WWII, which is why it was entered as &quot;USS ''Matsonia''&quot; in this article until a recent edit trimmed it back to just ''Matsonia''. At the start of the war, the US government bought a number of private ships for troop and supply movement, and in many cases offered them back to their original owners at a bargain price after the war. This is the case with ''Matsonia'' (ex-''Malolo''), though I don't know if the ship was specifically designated 'USS' rather than 'USAT' or similar; diaries and journals of the period often get this detail wrong.

==General Shoup Bio==

I enlisted in the Marine Corps in June 1955 , serving in 2/5 Camp Pen. ;Amtracs Yokosuka ; 9th Mid - Camp Fuji and Oki.; then, in 1959 untill discharge in Oct, at Div. Comm.Camp Pen. I am not aware of how closely or, distantly related I and the General might be and that is not the subject of this posting . I have entered the foregoing merely to pre - answer anyone who may be curious about our shared last name. That said, I would be most honored were I to learn that the General and myself were very closely related .RE: General Shoup's Bio . I recall that Gen. Krulak was 3rd Div. C.O. while I was in Japan : Feb.1957 to (Oct?/Nov?)1957,my time split between C Co.Amtracs at Yokosuka and the 9th at Fuji. Following the first Sputnik, the 9th Regt. took us to Oki.. This is where my own memory gets a bit cloudy , as to who our Div. C.O. was and, (my memory) is'nt helped any  (a) Due to a couple of TAD's ,which, at the end of each, we were told , &quot;gather 'round Marines, this never happened ,right !&quot; ..., &quot;aye aye sir&quot;. And (b) I have looked through a few Gen. Shoup Bio's ,some saying he was C.O. 3rd Div. in 1958 . I do not recall the same being the case . I do recall that he commanded the 1st Div. in 1959 while I was there . The &quot;few&quot; Bio's all seem to differ not only from each other but from the perspective of my own memory . Case in point : As an enlisted man (Div.Comm.-1959 I rec'd a piece of mail simply addressed to &quot;D. Shoup 1st Marine Division Camp Pendleton , California .&quot; Opening the envelope I realized (the stock offering) was sure not intended for me but for the General .I walked across the (100 ?) yards to Div.Headquarters and put the envelope on the Adjutants desk, no one being around and I was perfectly happy about that . In my very young mind I did not want to go through any explanations etc... . &quot;Very young&quot; as I had enlisted at the age of 16 .Can anyone firm-up an EXACT Bio of the General's locations of Command, for 1955 - 1959 , inclusive ? Thanks to any and all who endeavor to put the history of this Marine in correct sequence.   [[User:Dennis38|Dennis38]] ([[User talk:Dennis38|talk]]) 04:17, 23 May 2010 (UTC) Dennis Shoup

== Bridge ==

I am not sure if this is important enough to include in the article, but the bridge over the Wabash River at Covington, Indiana, is named for General Shoup.
