The '''6-ton, 6×6 Truck''' [[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation#G500 - G599|(G512, 514, 547, 569)]] was a family of heavy tactical trucks built for the [[United States Armed Forces]] during [[World War II]]. The basic cargo versions were designed to transport a {{convert|12,000|lb|abbr=on}} cargo load over all terrain in all weather. The chassis was built by [[Brockway Motor Company]], [[Corbitt (automobile company)|The Corbitt Company]], [[Four Wheel Drive|The Four Wheel Drive Auto Company (FWD)]], [[Ward LaFrance Truck Corporation]], and [[White Motor Company]]. They were replaced by the [[M54 (truck)|M39 series]] 5-ton trucks in the 1950s.

== History ==
In 1939 the US Army Ordinance Corps set standards for an all-wheel-drive off-road tactical trucks. A 6-ton (5,443kg) payload rated truck to tow anti-aircraft artillery was added. Corbitt, a small company who had sold the US Army trucks since 1917, began delivering 200 prototypes. In 1941 their improved Model 50SD6, with a larger engine and different hood and fenders, was standardized and went into production. Shortly after White began building them, they would be the largest producer. Brockway began in 1942, and FWD in 1945. Ward LaFrance also built the chassis. Seven body types were built, some by more than one manufacturer. All manufacturer’s models were virtually identical, with very minor variations.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|pp=9, 363, 368-370}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=208–212}}

Early models had closed cabs with full doors, in 1942 open cabs with half doors were introduced. Both could be equipped with a ring for a [[.50BMG|.50 cal.]] machine gun. Cranes had an open half-cab.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=208–212}}
{{sfnp|TM 9-813|1944|p=6}}

== Specifications ==
=== Engine and driveline ===
[[File:Hercules_HXD_engine.jpg|thumb|right|Hercules HXD (right front view)]]
[[File:6-ton winches.jpg|thumb]]

All standardized models used Hercules HXD engines, a [[Engine displacement|{{convert|855|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]]
[[Flathead engine|L-head]] [[Straight six engine|inline 6 cylinder]] [[Petrol engine|gasoline engine]] developing [[Horsepower|{{convert|202|hp|kW|abbr=on}}]] at 2100&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and {{convert|330|lbfft|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 900&amp;nbsp;rpm.{{sfnp|TM 9-813|1944|pp=124-125}}

A Fuller 4-speed manual non-synchronized [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] with a very low 1st and direct 4th gear was used. A Timken transfer case had a high and low range, a neutral for [[Power take-off|power take-off (PTO)]] operation, and engaged the front axle. Rear axles were Timken double reduction “pumpkin” type, tractors had heavier rear axles.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=208–212}}{{sfnp|TM 9-813|1944|pp=25-28}}

=== Chassis ===
Most models had a [[Vehicle frame#Ladder Frame|ladder frame]] with three live axles, the front on [[leaf spring]]s, the rear tandem leaf springs with locating arms. The exception was the crane truck, which had a walking beam rear suspension for stability. {{sfnp|TM 9-813|1944|pp=202, 215, 242-245}}

There were three [[wheelbase]]s. The short, used for prime movers, was {{convert|185|in|m|2}}, the long, used for cranes, was {{convert|197|in|m|2}}, and the extra long, used for bridge erectors, was {{convert|220|in|m|2}}. (Measurements are from the centerline of the front axle to the centerline of rear tandem).{{sfnp|TM 9-813|1944|p=17}}

Prime movers and tankers had 10.00x22 size tires, while bridge, crane, and semi-tractor trucks had 14.00x20s with a larger cross-section. All had dual rear tires. Brakes were [[Air brake (road vehicle)| full air]] with [[drum brake]]s on all wheels. Prime movers had adjustable electrical brake connections for trailer brakes.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|p=212}}{{sfnp|TM 9-813|1944|pp=224-226, 238}}

Prime movers had a {{convert|25,000|lb|abbr=on}} winch behind the cab, most other trucks had a front-mounted two-drum winch for self-recovery. Trucks converted from prime mover chassis had no winch at all.{{sfnp|TM 9-813|1944|pp=29-30}}

=== Prime  Mover Cargo Truck ===
Prime movers were used to tow field artillery pieces, they also transported gun crews, equipment, and ammunition. They had a pintle hitch at the rear for towing up to {{convert|40,000|lb|abbr=on}}. Another pintle at the front could be used to emplace the piece. A mid-mounted {{convert|25,000|lb|abbr=on}} winch had a centered cable drum and a capstan on the right side. Pulleys and rollers routed the cable under the body and out the rear frame cross-member. 

With a short wheelbase, mid-mounted winch, and short overhang, the body could only be {{convert|9|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} feet long. Both sides had sideboards with fold down troop seats and bows for a tarpaulin. Two spare tires were mounted inside the body, one along each side. Early models had all steel bodies, in 1942 they were replaced by largely wood types to conserve steel. All Corbitts (3,077) were prime movers, White also built 3,547.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=208–212}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2015|pp=3, 6-46}}

=== Bridge Erection Truck ===
Built on a long, reinforced chassis, they were used to carry [[Pontoon bridge#Engineer Treadway Bridge Company|treadway pontoon bridges]] for [[Engineer Combat Battalion|combat engineers]]. A large double arm hydraulic boom built by Heil was used to self unload components, often directly into a river. A {{convert|25,000|lb|abbr=on}} winch was mounted at the front. They had an auxiliary air compressor and large reservoir tanks, used to inflate pontoon floats. Brockway built 1,166, White 1,152, Ward LaFrance 589, and FWD 168.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|pp=368–369}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2015|pp=4,53-87}}{{sfnp|TM 9-813|1944|pp=302–303}}{{sfnp|TM 5-8067|2003|pp=208–209, 212}}{{sfnp|TM 5-272|1944}}

=== Crane Truck ===
Quickway cranes were used by combat engineers to unload and assemble bridge components. The rotating crane was powered by an auxiliary [[International Harvester|IHC]] {{convert|334|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} inline 4 cylinder engine developing {{convert|35|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. As a derrick it could lift {{convert|13,000|lb|abbr=on}} at a minimum radius of {{convert|10|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5,550|lb|abbr=on}} at a maximum radius of {{convert|25|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}. A shovel, clamshell, dragline, and drilling equipment could also be used. The cab had a windshield on the left side only, in transit the boom went over the right side and was braced to the front bumper. A {{convert|25,000|lb|abbr=on}} winch was mounted on the front. Brockway built 1,224.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|p=431}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2015|pp=4,88-109}}

=== Tractor Truck ===
As artillery pieces were being towed more often by tracked vehicles, prime mover chassis became available for other uses. In 1945 White built 112 semi-tractors with a fifth wheel and heavier rated Timken axles. Tire size was 14.00x20. Maximum speed was {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on}}, the highest in the series. A {{convert|25,000|lb|abbr=on}} winch was mounted on the front.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|p=370}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2015|pp=5, 120-128}}

=== Gasoline Tank Truck ===
Wanting a fuel tanker larger than the CCKW, the Army ordered 25 from White. The body had 4 self-sealing tank compartments for a total of {{convert|2,000|usgal|l|abbr=on}}. A bow and canvas top was fitted, so the truck could be disguised as a common cargo truck. Early trucks had a hard cab and a front mounted pintle hitch, later trucks had an open cab and a {{convert|25,000|lb|abbr=on}} front winch. A {{convert|2,000|usgal|l|abbr=on}} gallon trailer could be towed. No follow up orders were made.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|p=369}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2015|pp=4-5, 110-115}}

=== Fire Crash Truck ===
Fire Crash trucks were used by the Army Air Force to fight fires from airplane crashes. Brockway and Ward LaFrance chassis were equipped with bodies by Mack and [[American LaFrance]] (a separate company), both had auxiliary engines for the pump. This allowed the truck to move while two foam nozzles were being used. American LaFrance used their own 12 cylinder engine and 4 stage pump. Mack used a Continental R-6602 developing {{convert|225|hp|kW|abbr=on}} to drive a Hale centrifugal pump capable of {{convert|325|USgal/min|l/min|abbr=on}} at {{convert|500|psi|Pa|abbr=on}}.{{sfnp|Doyle|2015|pp=5, 116-119}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2800|1947|p=321}}{{sfnp|Vanderveen|2003|p=78}}

=== Prime Mover Van Truck ===
White built communication vans for the Army Air Force on the prime mover wheelbase. Bodies were from [[Superior Coach Company|Superior]] and [[Thomas Built Buses|Thomas]]. They were used to tow and power the SCR-545-A anti-aircraft radar set. White built 1,870.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|p=369}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2015|pp=3-4, 47-52}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2800|1947|p=304}}
