The '''Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle''' or [[Infantry Mobility Vehicle]] is an [[Australia]]n-built four wheeled, all-wheel drive armoured vehicle. The Bushmaster is produced by
[[Thales Australia]] and [[Oshkosh Truck]] has a contract to provide support and would manufacture in the US if there were an American order. The Bushmaster is currently in service with the [[Australian Army]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]], [[Royal Netherlands Army]], [[British Army]] and the [[Jamaica Defence Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Angus|first=Garfield|url=http://jis.gov.jm/pm-commissions-jdfs-protected-mobility-vehicles-squadron/|title=PM Commissions JDF's Protected Mobility Vehicles Squadron|work=Jamaica Information Service|date=14 January 2016|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the Bushmaster is to provide protected mobility transport (or protected troop lift capability), with [[infantry]] dismounting from the vehicle before going into action. As the Bushmaster is only lightly armoured, the term [[Infantry Mobility Vehicle]] (IMV) was initially adopted to distinguish it from a heavier wheeled or tracked [[armoured personnel carrier]], such as the [[ASLAV]] and [[Variants of the M113 armored personnel carrier#Australia|M113]] also in Australian service. Later the Bushmaster's designation was changed to Protected Mobility Vehicle (PMV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haugh|first1=David|last2=Keenan|first2=Patrick|url=http://www.warwheels.net/BushmasterIMVindex.html|title=Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle (PMV)|website=WarWheels.Net|access-date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1991 Defence Force Structure Review identified the Australian Army need for an Infantry Mobility Vehicle (IMV).&lt;ref name=&quot;anao1&quot;&gt;Australian National Audit Office ''{{cite web |url=http://www.anao.gov.au/WebSite.nsf/Publications/C96AAB7803272D56CA256EC200793001 |title= Defence's Project Bushranger: Acquisition of Infantry Mobility Vehicles |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917202519/http://anao.gov.au/WebSite.nsf/Publications/C96AAB7803272D56CA256EC200793001 |archivedate=2006-09-17}}''&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 White Paper stated that new land force vehicles would be acquired.&lt;ref name=&quot;anao1&quot; /&gt; Project Bushranger (Land 116) was created to procure both protected and unprotected vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;anao1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miltech&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dover|first1=Benjamin|title=Project Bushranger comes to fruition|work=Military Technology|issue=Vol. 23 (6)|date=June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Infantry Improvised Mobility Vehicle (IIMV), a fleet of unarmoured [[Land Rover Perentie]] vehicles, were purchased from November 1993 to fill the IMV role until it entered service.&lt;ref name=&quot;anao1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miltech&quot; /&gt; In February 1994, the draft specification for the IMV was released, followed in July by the invitation to register interest with 17 proposals received including by Australian company [[Perry Engineering]] with the Bushmaster and by Australian Specialised Vehicle System with the Taipan derived from the South African [[Mamba APC|Mamba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anao1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miltech&quot; /&gt; In September 1995, the request for tender was issued to 5 shortlisted proposals and in January 1997 due to withdrawals the Bushmaster and Taipan remained the only bidders.&lt;ref name=&quot;anao1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miltech&quot; /&gt;

In early 1996, Perry Engineering produced a prototype Bushmaster based on a [[Ireland|Irish]] designed [[Timoney Technology Limited of Ireland|Timoney Technologies]] MP44, including the Rockwell/Timoney independent suspension, and with [[United States|U.S.]] company [[Stewart &amp; Stevenson]] components from the [[Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles]] (FMTV).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Further contenders for Australia's Bushranger|work=Jane's International Defense Review|issue=20|date=1 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background – Armoured Patrol Vehicle Candidates – Bushmaster|url=http://www.casr.ca/bg-apv-bushmaster.htm|website=Canadian American Strategic Review|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timoney MP44 Mine Protected Armoured Personnel Carrier|url=http://www.geocities.ws/irisharmoredvehicles/MP44.html|website=Irish Armored Vehicles|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 65% of the components by Stewart &amp; Stevenson were from the FMTV including engine, transmission, steering, instrumentation, electrical and pneumatic systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miltech&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane5&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foss|first1=Christopher F|title=Bushmaster in frame for Australian army|work=Jane's Defence Weekly|issue=97|date=19 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype was built in less than seven months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane5&quot; /&gt;

In September 1996, the Australian government owned company Australian Defence Industries (ADI) purchased the intellectual property rights from [[Boral|Boral Johns Perry Group]], who owned Perry Engineering, with agreement from Timoney Technologies and Stewart &amp; Stevenson.&lt;ref name=&quot;anao1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=ADI launches Bushmaster Infantry Mobility Vehicle|work=Jane's International Defense Review|issue=22|date=1 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Infantry Mobility Vehicles|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1997-06-24%2F0082;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1997-06-24%2F0000%22|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=Hansard|issue=Page 6196|publisher=Parliament of Australia|date=24 June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foss|first1=Christopher F. J|title=Australia closes in on infantry vehicle order|work=Jane's Defence Weekly|issue=17|date=11 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1997, ADI launched its re-engineered Bushmaster proposal changing the design and shape of the hull to withstand a greater force and associated internal and external features.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane4&quot; /&gt; In March 1998, three Bushmaster IMVs and three Taipain IMVs built in South Africa started a 44-week competitive evaluation trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miltech&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane3&quot; /&gt; Neither vehicle fully met all of the requirements of the specification, and performed with varying success over the course of the trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;anao1&quot; /&gt;

On 10 March 1999, ADI was awarded the Bushranger contract to produce the Bushmaster to be manufactured at their [[Bendigo]] facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miltech&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bostock|first1=Ian|title=Australian infantry orders 350 Bushmasters from ADI|work=Jane's Defence Weekly|issue=Vol. 031 (011)|date=17 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1999, ADI was privatised becoming 50% owned by French company [[Thales Group|Thales]] and 50% owned by Australian company [[Transfield Holdings|Transfield]]. In 2006, ADI was renamed to Thales Australia following Thales buying out Transfield.

In October 2016 it was announced that Australia and Indonesia would jointly develop a vehicle based on the Bushmaster for used by the Indonesian military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grevatt|first=Jon|url=http://www.janes.com/article/65071/australia-indonesia-to-jointly-develop-an-armoured-vehicle|title=Australia, Indonesia to jointly develop an armoured vehicle|work= IHS Jane's Defence Weekly|date=1 November 2016|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bushmaster interior.jpg|thumb|left|Australian and United States Army personnel inside a Bushmaster]]

The Bushmaster is optimised for operations in [[northern Australia]], and is capable of carrying up to 9 soldiers and their equipment, fuel and supplies for 3 days, depending on the type of variant. The vehicle is fitted with [[air conditioning]] and was once planned to have a cool water drinking system, but was omitted upon production due to cost constraints. After operational complaints the drinking water cooling system is being reconsidered for installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cotterill|first=Daniel|title=Bendigo's companion for the battlefield|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/bendigos-companion-for-the-battlefield/story-e6frgdox-1111112543287|work=[[The Australian]]|publisher=[[News Limited]]|date=25 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a road cruise speed of 100&amp;nbsp;km/h and an operational range of 800&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Connery&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Connery|first1=David|last2=Cran|first2=David|last3=Evered|first3=David|title=Conducting Counterinsurgency – Reconstruction Task Force 4 in Afghanistan|publisher=Big Sky Publishing|location=Newport, New South Wales|year=2012|pages=24–25|isbn=9781921941771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bushmaster is a [[mine protected vehicle]] and provides a high degree of protection against [[land mine]]s, using its [[v-hull]] [[monocoque]] to deflect the blast away from the vehicle and its occupants. The vehicle's armour provides protection against small arms of up to [[7.62 mm]] ball ammunition, 81mm mortar fragments, Claymore mines, and with additional applique armor, protection for armour piercing ammunition of up to 7.62mm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miltech&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane4&quot; /&gt; The fuel and hydraulic tanks of the vehicle are located outside the crew compartment, while it also has an automatic fire suppression system. The troop carrier variant of the Bushmaster is fitted with one gun ring. The forward gun ring can be fitted with a 5.56&amp;nbsp;mm or 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm machine gun.&lt;ref name=Connery/&gt; The two rear hatches each have a [[mounting boss]] to allow the attachment of a swing mount capable of holding a 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm machine gun.

The Bushmaster is air transportable by [[C-130 Hercules]], [[C-17 Globemaster III]] and [[Mil Mi-26]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;''Russians provide big fix'' Army News, 1 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bushmaster takes a ride|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/op/afghanistan/gallery/2010/20100312/index.htm|publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|date=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first armoured vehicle to be designed and completely manufactured in Australia since the [[Sentinel tank]] during [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miltech&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Toal&gt;{{cite news|last=Toal|first=Mick|url=http://www.australiandefence.com.au/82A4111C-8E03-11DE-93CF0050568C22C9|title=Bushmaster turns 10|journal=Australian Defence Magazine|publisher=Yaffa Publishing Group|location=Sydney, New South Wales|date=1 July 2009|issn=1324-6550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In keeping with the vehicle's role and capabilities, the [[Australian Army]] designates Bushmaster equipped infantry units as being [[motorised infantry|motorised]], and not [[mechanised infantry|mechanised]]. Following the vehicle's troubled development, a total of 299 Bushmasters were ordered by the Wheeled Manoeuvre Systems Program Office of the [[Defence Materiel Organisation]] for the [[Australian Defence Force]] (reduced from the 370 which were originally ordered).&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;Brian Robins and Gerard Ryle ''[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/30/1083224588538.html Beating about the Bushmaster]'' in [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], 1 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Bushmaster deliveries began in 2005 (three years later than was originally scheduled) and were scheduled to be completed in July 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;anao1&quot;/&gt; Deliveries of the troop carrier variant (152 vehicles) were completed on 7 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hand over of Bushmaster Vehicle to Defence|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/minister/Billsontpl.cfm?CurrentId=5713|work=Press release|publisher=The Hon. Bruce Billson MP, Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence|date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deliveries of the command variant were completed by mid-2006 followed by the delivery of the other variants.

==Modifications==
In September 2007, the Army reported that the fleet would be upgraded with a [[Remote weapon station|protected weapon system]] (PWS) that is stabilised with thermal imaging, camera and laser range finder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sep07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delivering to the frontline |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/news/ontarget/Apr07/nb3.cfm |work=OnTarget |agency=Defence Material Organisation |date=April 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113101901/http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/news/ontarget/Apr07/nb3.cfm |archivedate=13 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other upgrades include spall curtains, fire suppression system, cool water drinking system and an additional seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sep07&quot; /&gt; Following criticisms from Australian soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan including that the gunner is exposed to enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Banham|first=Cynthia|title=Safety of armoured vehicles under fire|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/safety-of-armoured-vehicles-under-fire/2006/09/01/1156817073178.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2009 and 2012, the Protected Mobility, Troop, Command and Mortar variants in use in Afghanistan were upgraded. The upgrade included the addition of the protected remotely controlled weapons station, automated fire suppression system and ECM systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dec13&quot; /&gt; The Special Operations Task Group vehicles were fitted with a weapon ring to mount a 12.7mm heavy machine gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dec13&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hetherington|first1=WO2 Andrew|title=Keeping soldiers safe on operation|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/Publications/NewsPapers/Army/editions/1319/1319.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=Army: The Soldiers' Newspaper|issue=1319 ed|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a survivability enhancement to the lower hull, floor, seat mounts and axle caps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dec13&quot; /&gt; Two adaptive roller kits were provided able to be mounted to the front of the vehicle for protection against mines or IEDs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dec13&quot; /&gt; In late 2012, the entire fleet was rotated, with new upgraded vehicles provided with increased blast protection and the option of adding extra external composited armour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dec13&quot; /&gt;

In 2015, 45 Bushmasters had their remote weapons systems (RWS) upgraded similar to systems on tank turrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Self-defence boost for Bushmasters|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/Publications/NewsPapers/Army/editions/1352/1352.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=Army: The Soldiers' Newspaper|edition=1352|date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational service==

===Australia===
[[File:Bushmasters Afghanistan 2010.jpg|thumb|Two Bushmasters passing through a settlement in Afghanistan during April 2010]]

To date, Australia's Bushmasters have been deployed on five operations:
* Two prototypes were deployed to [[INTERFET|East Timor]] in 1999 for trials, VIP protection and media escort duties.&lt;ref name=Toal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bostock|first1=Ian|title=Bushmaster deployed in East Timor|work=Jane's Defence Weekly|issue=Vol. 032 (019)|date=10 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A small number of Bushmasters were operated by [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]] soldiers part of the [[Operation Slipper|Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan]] from September 2005 after its re-deployment until late 2013.
* [[6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|A Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] was equipped with Bushmasters during its role as the security response force for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.defence.gov.au/opacolyte/images/gallery/20060328a/index.htm Photos of 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment during Operation Acolyte]''.

* The Reconstruction Task Force, later redesignated the Mentoring Task Force, which was deployed in Afghanistan from August 2006 to late 2013 was also equipped with a large number of Bushmasters.&lt;ref name=Connery/&gt;

On 17 March 2010, all five Australian soldiers from the [[Mentoring Task Force One|1st Mentoring Task Force]] who were occupying a Bushmaster were wounded, three of them seriously, when it was hit by a roadside bomb in the Chora Valley north of the main Australian base near Tarin Kowt in Oruzgan Province during a routine vehicle patrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five diggers wounded by roadside bomb|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/five-diggers-wounded-by-roadside-bomb/story-e6freuy9-1225842022363|agency=Australian Associated Press|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2011, 31 Bushmasters have been damaged beyond repair while serving with the Australian Army.&lt;ref name=ArmyNews26May/&gt; The largest number operating in Afghanistan at one time was 104.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dec13&quot; /&gt;

In July 2006 the [[Netherlands|Dutch Government]] announced an urgent purchase of 25 Bushmasters to equip [[Royal Netherlands Army]] units operating in [[Afghanistan]]. Due to the urgency of this purchase these vehicles were taken from Australian Army stocks. Additional Bushmasters will be built to replenish the Australian inventory. 23 Bushmasters were directly delivered to Dutch Army units in Afghanistan starting from 28 August. The remaining two vehicles were transported to The Netherlands to be used for training purposes. Twelve of the Bushmasters were fitted with a [[Thales Group|Thales]] [[SWARM]] [[Remote Weapon Station|remote weapon station]] before delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2006/08/dutch-spend-eur-25m-on-bushmaster-imvs-for-afghan-mission-updated/index.php |title=Dutch Spend EUR25M on Bushmaster IMVs for Afghan Mission |work=Defense Industry Daily |publisher=Watershed Publishing |date=7 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

9 July 2007, Electro Optic Systems Holdings Limited was awarded a contract of A$5.8 million for the supply of remote weapon systems for use by the Netherlands army. The contract was awarded to EOS by Thales Australia for fitting to the Bushmaster Infantry Mobility Vehicles manufactured by Thales for the Netherlands army. The order entails 17 [[Common Remotely Operated Weapon System|CROWS]] Remote Weapon Stations. It is expected that the first of these systems will be operational in theatre by August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.eos-optronics.com/news/RemoteWeaponSystemBreakthrough.htm Remote Weapon System Breakthrough]'' EOS Optronics GmbH, 13 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 2007, during an engagement with the Taliban a 20-year-old Dutch soldier was killed in action. His body was evacuated in a Bushmaster which was subsequently attacked with small arms, mortars and RPGs. The vehicle was struck several times but all soldiers in the Bushmaster survived and were unhurt. Since the vehicle was immobilized and still under attack, they were forced to abandon it. Since salvage was not possible the Bushmaster was later destroyed by a [[RNLAF|Dutch]] [[AH-64 Apache|Apache]] helicopter. The troops were transported out of danger by a second Bushmaster IMV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/104756/Nederlander-omgekomen-in-Uruzgan.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019123712/http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/104756/Nederlander-omgekomen-in-Uruzgan.html|date=20 September 2007|archivedate=19 October 2007|title=Opnieuw Nederlander omgekomen in Uruzgan|work=[[De Pers]]|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2007 during a fire-fight between a Dutch patrol and Taliban insurgents, a Bushmaster was hit by an improvised bomb. Although none of the passengers were hurt, the bomb damaged the front of the Bushmaster. The Bushmaster was sent to [[Kamp Holland]] (the Dutch base) for repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bushmaster beschadigd na vuurcontact|url=http://www.defensie.nl/missies/actueel/isaf/2007/10/20/4688385/Bushmaster_beschadigd_na_vuurcontact|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministerie van Defensie]]|date=20 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dutch Bushmaster Afghanistan 2007.jpg|thumb|right|A Dutch Bushmaster in Afghanistan during 2007]]

The Netherlands has ordered additional Bushmasters on several occasions in 2007 and 2008. On 20 November 2007 the Dutch Defence Ministry announced that it would acquire an additional 10 vehicles to replace the two damaged and two destroyed vehicles and a [[Sisu Pasi|Patria]] armoured vehicle which was also destroyed in Uruzgan. One vehicle will be sent to the Netherlands for training purposes, and the rest will go directly to Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensie.nl/missies/actueel/isaf/2007/11/20/46115763/Extra_Bushmasters_voor_missie_Uruzgan|title=Extra Bushmasters voor missie Uruzgan|date=20 November 2007|publisher=Ministerie van Defensie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch ordered a further 13 Bushmasters in June 2008, taking their total order to 49 vehicles.
