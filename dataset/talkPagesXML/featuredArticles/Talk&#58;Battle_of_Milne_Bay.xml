battle of milne bay
Well done Gdr for finding the pic.[[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 16:37, Oct 24, 2004 (UTC)

== Re-stating the Significance of Milne Bay ==
I have removed the claim that the &quot;Battle of the Tenaru&quot; (usually known as the Battle of Alligator Creek) on Guadalcanal a few days before the Battle of Milne Bay was the first land defeat of the Japanese.  There is no comparison between the two events.  If the Japanese Army had re-boarded their ships and abandoned Guadalcanal in August 1942 as a result of the battle, THAT would have been comparable.  As it happened, the Japanese reaction was to reinforce Guadalcanal and vigorously renew the attack on Henderson Field, so the fighting went on for another six months.  However, I have not dismissed the Tenaru; I have retained in the article a respectful mention of that action and its significance in the context of Milne Bay.

Alligator Creek was a setback and a surprise for the Japanese, but did not end the campaign.  The Japanese had exerienced local setbacks before: in their first attempt to take Wake Island they were resoundingly defeated, and they were successfully checked on several occasions during the British retreat down the Malay peninsula, and in the American retreat to Bataan.  But the outcome in every case was that the Japanese eventually took their objectives.

Milne Bay was not a local setback; it was an unqualified defeat for the Japanese, and completely ended their campaign.  The result of the battle was that, thirteen days after landing, the Japanese withdrew their entire invasion force and never returned.  That had never happened before in the Pacific War.  It did not happen after the Battle of Alligator Creek.  [[User:Peter Bell|Peter Bell]] ([[User talk:Peter Bell|talk]]) 08:24, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

== New location map ==
I wrote the [[Cyril Clowes]] article, and I have just created a map for it showing the location of Milne Bay in relation to the rest of New Guinea and Cape York, Queensland. I would like to add it here too. Any thoughts?

Also I am about to create a more zoomed-in map showing the places around Milne Bay mentioned in the Clowes and Milne Bay articles - Gili Gili, Ahioma, Rabi etc etc. I don't want to use the Japanese map that's here as it is just not clear enough for my liking. When I have created the 2nd map for Clowes I'd be happy to see it here for Milne Bay too. cheers [[User:SpoolWhippets|SpoolWhippets]] ([[User talk:SpoolWhippets|talk]]) 03:29, 27 March 2010 (UTC)

== &quot;They died slowly&quot; account ==
I have read in several different books a story, possibly apocryphal, that in one instance after a Japanese retreat Australian troops discovered the remains of a number of their comrades who had been tied to poles and tortured to death.  According to the story, the Japanese had left behind a taunting sign which said, in English, &quot;They died slowly.&quot;  I don't remember where I read it, but one of the accounts stated that this happened at Milne Bay.  Any truth to this story? [[User:Cla68|Cla68]] ([[User talk:Cla68|talk]]) 06:53, 13 December 2011 (UTC)
:G'day Cla68, one of my sources (Brune 2004, p. 357) has a recount by a 61st Bn officer of finding Papuans and some 61st Bn men who had had their arms tied behind their backs and had been bayonetted, although it doesn't mention the story about the sign, though.

In regards to the campaign box, shouldn't the allied troop number be broken down to more adequately reflect the number of troops engaged? All the Japanese were combat troops but the allies only had around 4,500 infantry. The rest of the allied numbers were made up of 644 RAAF, 1,365 engineers (U.S. 43rd) and 2,949 in other support roles. [[User:WLRoss|Wayne]] ([[User talk:WLRoss|talk]]) 06:04, 26 August 2012 (UTC)
:G'day, Wayne. This is a good suggestion. I've added 4,500 infantry to the infobox and I'd be happy to break it down as you suggest, but I don't have a ref that covers your exact figures. What is the source that you are using for those figures? Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 07:02, 26 August 2012 (UTC)
:::::The numbers came from [http://kokoda.commemoration.gov.au/milne-bay/japanese-defeat-at-milne-bay.php this site]. It says total troops were 9,458 compared to this article which says 8,824 so I checked to see why there would be a discrepancy. From other sites it seems that the AIF conscripted over 600 local Papuans to help build the airfields who are sometimes included in the total as they remained for the fighting. The image on that page is pretty good as well, someone should see how it's copyrighted. [[User:WLRoss|Wayne]] ([[User talk:WLRoss|talk]]) 11:26, 27 August 2012 (UTC) 
:::It probably surprises no one that I do not agree. First of all, I prepared a pretty good OrBat for the article. If you check it, you will see that the assertion about the Japanese is not quite true. Secondly, I do not like quoting &quot;bayonet strength&quot;. This is not an 18th century battle. It misunderstands the nature of 20th century warfare. The RAAF in particular do not like being described as not been &quot;combat troops&quot;. And units like the engineers could, would, and did participate in the ground fighting. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 09:02, 26 August 2012 (UTC)
::::Fair enough. It certainly wasn't my intention to promote a &quot;bayonet strength&quot; mentality by breaking down the figures and adding some of the main units to the infobox. To clarify, though, I don't think that Wayne's proposal was to classify any units specifically as &quot;combat&quot; and &quot;non combat&quot; (which I would certainly be opposed to, knowing how unjust that concept is particularly in relation to engineers who are sometimes in front of the infantry, but also to the artillery that frequently get called upon to carry a pack and a rifle, the truckies and reccie mechs that risk IEDs on the road, the ordnance, catering, signals Diggers, etc. that stand guard and mount patrols, and the others that I've missed who take their chances on deployment with IDF like everyone else). I actually think the propsal was just to break down the figures to provide the reader with a little more context using categories like RAAF, engineers, infantry, in the knowledge the readers wil interpret this simply as it is presented. That being said, if you think it promotes such a mentality, I'm fine with leaving it out. Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 10:29, 26 August 2012 (UTC)
::::: I'm not sure I really see the problem Hawkeye. Whilst I agree that using the number of infantrymen only is an imprecise way of measuring combat power, the infantry companies and battalions were the primary manoeuvre elements at Milne Bay. That is not to say that the other arms (such as engineers and artillery) were not involved in combat, but that by their very nature their primary role was as enablers to those manoeuvre elements. What we currently have are figures in the infobox that give the impression that the Allies outnumbered the Japanese by nearly 5 to 1. This is equally inexact to me. A breakdown of troop numbers along the lines suggested above would seem a logical way to get around this. IRT units in the infobox it was my suggestion to AR on his talkpage that resulted in this being implemented. The way I saw it whilst there is indeed a detailed ORBAT article it is separate from this article so a short summary of the key units in the infobox didn't really seem all that controversial to me, and would be similar to many other MILHIST articles. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 11:07, 26 August 2012 (UTC)
:::::: I completely understand what you are saying. We are deailing with perceptions here. The reader has to ask: what does it mean if the Allies outnumbered the Japanese? Can such ratios tell us something about 20th century warfare? The reader should also consider that the base units were not there to support the infantry; the infantry were there to support the base, which was actually the important thing. I was afraid that this would mislead the reader. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 06:55, 27 August 2012 (UTC)
:::::::I cant see a problem with a breakdown in the infobox. We are not talking about a general term such as &quot;combat troops&quot; but infantry, RAAF, engineers and support which is what they were. The article can mention their roles. For example, the contribution by the RAAF is obvious and the engineers helped man the anti-aircraft guns and also helped defend the No 3 airfield. With just a combined troop number we will have readers asking why beating the Japanese was so hard if we outnumbered them five to one when in fact the odds were closer to three to one. [[User:WLRoss|Wayne]] ([[User talk:WLRoss|talk]]) 11:14, 27 August 2012 (UTC)
::::::::Yes! General MacArthur had done what generals are supposed to do: concentrated a superior force at the point of decision; but no quick decision was forthcoming. This was very frustratying back at GHQ. The reasons are explained in the article: the terrain, and the unwillingness of the Japanese to surrender just because they had been beaten. This was known, but the  doctrinal implications had not yet been digested. The Australian Army had explicitly rejected the doctrine of &quot;bayonet strength&quot; advocated by British General [[Ivor Maxse]] back in 1918; Generals Monash and Blamey showed him the door. Instead, they followed their own doctrine, which involved comparing firepower, based on factoring all the arms and weapons.

== Malaria stats ==
How can more than 1,000 people per 1,000 people develop an illness? Either the stats are wrong, or they need explanation. --[[Special:Contributions/194.176.105.135|194.176.105.135]] ([[User talk:194.176.105.135|talk]]) 10:09, 29 August 2012 (UTC)

== Facebook links to reputable organization reverts ==
Whether Wikipedia &quot;approves&quot; of Facebook or not (and ''many'' disapprove of Wikipedia, our schools reject any reference to it and we have a Senator at the moment under fire for plagiarizing from articles here with news people rolling their eyes at &quot;''Wikipedia'' of all things . . .&quot;), [https://www.facebook.com/iwm.london museums], [https://www.facebook.com/RoyalAustralianNavy military organizations] and an increasing number of [https://www.facebook.com/libraryofcongress more reputable organizations] than Wikipedia now have Facebook pages containing valuable information on exhibits, notification of new finds and such. Since the pages change frequently I can see ''not'' using them as any sort of reference. Content is content and should be judged on content. If someone demonstrates the [https://www.facebook.com/MilneBayMLARC Milne Bay Memorial Library and Research Centre] is not a reputable organization then I'd support a ban of its public Facebook page even as an external link. Otherwise, making it easy for readers to follow up with an outside source of information specializing on a subject is a reader aid. Banning that particular sort of link reeks of silly games and not any serious effort to guide content toward respectability. [[User:Palmeira|Palmeira]] ([[User talk:Palmeira|talk]]) 13:31, 7 November 2013 (UTC)
:G'day, thank you for sharing your opinion. To clarify, I'm not questioning the reliability of the Milne Bay Memorial Library and Research Centre, but Wikipedia policy ([[WP:ELNO]]) does seem to preclude the inclusion of a link to its Facebook page. My understanding of the reasons behind the policy outlined at [[WP:ELNO]] is that the concern is that such sites have &quot;user generated content&quot;. Interestingly, Wikipedia also falls into this category, which is the reason policy doesn't allow us to cite Wikipedia as a reference even on Wikipedia, so at least we are consistent in that regard ;-)  Of course, as I said, this is my own interpretation and I could be wrong. It would be good to hear what others think, so I've posted a question here: [[Wikipedia:External links/Noticeboard]] and invited others to comment.

== Japanese name ==
The Japanese article says in its first line &quot;ラビの戦い&quot;, making it '''Operation ''Rabi.''''' Is there a source for ''RE?'' That said, Japanese Wikipedia is not a valid source either.

== Various questions on article lede and infobox wordage ==

*On the sentence in the lede: &quot;The battle is considered to be the first major battle in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces.&quot; Either the word &quot;Allied&quot; or &quot;decisive&quot; must be delimited/defined or this is patently incorrect--see e.g., [[Battle of Changsha (1942)]] (and even perhaps (though arguable) the allied invasion of [[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo]]). I suggest a dodge e.g., &quot;..an early...&quot; or better yet just ditching arguable statement entirely.
*Somehow the NPOV use of &quot;allied&quot; in the lede is lost in the infobox which notes: &quot;Australian Victory&quot;. Note for example the deviation from the usage &quot;Allied Victory&quot; in [[Omaha Beach]] and [[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo]].
[[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 18:05, 30 January 2016 (UTC)
:G'day, Juan. I agree with changing the infobox to &quot;Allied victory&quot;, although, I think we should get a few opinions first to establish a consensus. However, I think the issue with the lead statement about the &quot;first major battle in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces&quot; will be harder to solve. It is a key part of the Milne Bay narrative, IMO, including for instance Harries &amp; Harries' seminal work on the Imperial Japanese Army where it says &quot;...at Milne Bay in August 1942 the Australians were ready for the Japanese, and inflicted on them their first full-scale defeat on land.&quot; (p. 404). The limitations of the statement are explained in the lead and elsewhere. Potentially that could be tweaked: either to mention Changsha as another example, or to clarify that Milne Bay was to the first time the Anglo-American allies had done so...I'm not sure. Anyway, I will wait to see if others comment. Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 22:27, 30 January 2016 (UTC)
::Thanks for responding, [[User:AustralianRupert]]. To test the waters I will change the infobox and see what happens. I do believe though that the &quot;first&quot; stuff must be qualified in some way. Perhaps as you suggested or &quot;Australian-American allies&quot;.[[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 22:32, 30 January 2016 (UTC)
::: I've no issue with the infobox change to &quot;Allied victory&quot; but its not an issue to me either way. Re the &quot;first major battle in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces&quot; I agree with AR that this is a key point in much of the literature on Milne Bay so the article should (and currently does) reflect that. The point re &quot;the first time the Anglo-American allies had done so&quot; was probably the actual significance of the battle even if most people in Australia/UK/US etc probably wouldn't have noticed the events at Changsa at the time or even since. For that reason I suggest noting the apparent contradiction in a footnote only and retaining the current wording (anymore than that would probably be undue weight). Of course this is on the proviso that a reliable source can be provided supporting the fact that Changsa &lt;s&gt;was a decisive Chinese victory&lt;/s&gt; is considered in the same terms as Milne Bay.

::::: Maybe this is overly clever, but ... what if we describe it as the first decisive Japanese defeat on land ''of the Pacific War''? Changsha preceded the Pacific War, so it cleverly dodges the issue. --[[User:Yaush|Yaush]] ([[User talk:Yaush|talk]]) 04:38, 31 January 2016 (UTC)
::::::Yaush's suggestion, possibly coupled with a footnote or maybe just a short sentence in the Results subsection, mentioning Changsha would probably work, IMO, so long as there is a reliable source. Thoughts? [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 06:50, 31 January 2016 (UTC)
:::::::I concur with most if not all of the above suggestions. The main point being that the article should not say something patently incorrect in the lede--where stylistically one wishes to avoid confusing caveats. In the body of the article it is, as pointed out by folk above, an important and notable myth/meme of the battle in Australia and the body is the place to consider the nuances/caveats (e.g., by footnotes or whatever). If left in the lede it has to have some (perhaps tricky) qualification, e.g., invoking the Pacific theater as Yaush suggested.

== Cleaned up some Japanese Factual Errors ==

I cleaned up some erroneous translation errors in the text:

1) It is cited as the battle of &quot;RE&quot; in the original text... not sure who got this or where it comes from ...the Battle of Milne Bay is known as the &quot;Battle of Rabi&quot; in Japanese. The Japanese took a geographical point, in this case the point of their initial landing, called it &quot;Rabi&quot; in the phonetic Japanese alphabet and that is what they call this battle. This has been cleaned up. 

2) There were only two Japanese type 95 tanks landed. After an initial attack the Japanese cite them as being &quot;abandonded to the mud&quot; after being unmovable. There were no more tanks than these two. 

3) The Japanese Special Landing Forces name was &quot;Kaigun Tokubetsu Rikusentai&quot; - or Tokusen for short. This has been ammended. 

4) I added the 1971 paper from the Japanese Defence Ministry (Boeisho) describing these events to the source materials. Brune, although a good writer and story teller relates a one-sided version of events from the narratives of the field soldiers and there is sometimes no cross-referencing of facts, this is an attempt to balance the facts as we know then from both sides.

: {{ping|Canadaman1}} - Could the full bibliographic details of 1971 paper you mention pls be added to the &quot;References&quot; section of the article? At the moment we only have a short citation.

:::G'day, I've added the citation that I think it comes from, having found something similar here: [http://dc.etsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2070&amp;context=etd]. I have also restored Operation RE to the lead as that is cited in the body of the article to Chant 1986, although I have also kept &quot;Battle of Rabi&quot; as it seems a fair addition. Beyond that, I have also moved the ref out of the lead as we don't tend to add them in Featured Articles, hence the need to add the information to the body. Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 11:27, 21 March 2016 (UTC)
::::That looks good to me. I agree the information should be in the body of the article where you have added it. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 12:00, 21 March 2016 (UTC)

== Map of action for possible inclusion / discussion ==

[[File:Battle of Milne Bay 25 August - 7 September 1942.png|300px|right|thumb|Battle of Milne Bay 25 August – 7 September 1942]]
Hello all. I recently drafted a map (see right) of the action at Milne Bay. My skills are fairly limited with these things though so I am posting it here for discussion IRT any amendments that might be necessary and possible inclusion if it is considered helpful. I accept it is a little cluttered and there other draw backs IRT both format and space limitations. Thanks in advance for any comments. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 22:31, 11 June 2016 (UTC)
:G'day, AC, that looks pretty good to me. Thanks for this. I propose to put it in the Prelude section and move the location map up and to the left. Seems to fit when I play around with it at 300 px. Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 00:27, 12 June 2016 (UTC)
::Or maybe in the &quot;Initial landing&quot; section, replacing the Japanese language map? [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 01:04, 12 June 2016 (UTC)
::: Yes I think it would work in the &quot;Initial landing&quot; section. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 01:17, 12 June 2016 (UTC)
:::: FYI I made a few changes to the map today - the main one was to reduce the size of the unit graphics as they were taking up too much room. Are there any other opinions about it? {{ping|Hawkeye7}} - given your efforts in particular on this article to date if you have some time to take a look over the map and let me know if you think its up to snuff I'd be grateful. Thanks. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 10:00, 14 June 2016 (UTC)
:::::Are there any objections to adding this map in? Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 16:14, 24 June 2016 (UTC)

== On &quot;The battle is considered to be the first major battle in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces. ==

My &quot;by whom&quot; comment on this line in the lead has been deleted &quot;Per MOS:LEAD&quot;. Presumably, the editor {{ping|Hawkeye7}} is implying that citations are not needed in the lead. Well I can't find anywhere else in the article a citation to support this statement. This may perhaps be my oversight tho. 'Twould have been helpful if said editor pointed to where this was supported. Or is this just Australian lore? Which by itself is notable if correctly phrased and so cited. I don't see it so I am restoring my &quot;by whom&quot;. I will paraphrase an earlier comment on this issue: either the words &quot;Allied&quot; or &quot;major&quot; or &quot;Japanese land forces&quot; must be delimited/defined or this is patently incorrect--see e.g., [[Battle of Changsha (1942)]] (and even perhaps (though arguable) the allied invasion during the [[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo]]). [[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 20:16, 10 October 2016 (UTC)
: As far as I can see this is covered in the article and is referenced there (which often is considered to be sufficient to not require referencing in the lead per WP:LEAD, which I'm assuming was the reason this was mentioned). Specifically in the &quot;''Results''&quot; section the article currently states: &quot;''The Allied victory at Milne Bay therefore represented the first &quot;full-scale defeat [of the Japanese] on land&quot;''.&quot; This seems to be quote from Harries &amp; Harries 1991, p. 404. (citation #161). Prior to this it briefly discusses a number of previous &quot;minor local defeats&quot; at Wake Island and Tenaru. There is also the quote from Field Marshal Sir William Slim which includes &quot;''Australian troops had, at Milne Bay in New Guinea, inflicted on the Japanese their first undoubted defeat on land...''&quot; (citation #156 and #162) Taken together to me these seem to support the information presented in the lead sufficiently but that is just my opinion. That said if there are WP:RS sources which discuss Changsha and / or Tulagi (or others) in relation to these assessments of Milne Bay then I'd have no issue with that being added to the article (with the appropriate weight etc) if there was consensus for this. Is this being proposed? [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 00:57, 11 October 2016 (UTC)
::G'day, yes it relates to the part highlighted by AC. Anyway, I've tweaked the article a little to try to clarify this a little more. Please let me know if you think it needs more work.

::::G'day, interesting question. Yes, it relates to morale. Per the Macquarie Dictionary, morale as in the &quot;moral or mental condition of the troops&quot;. Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 13:30, 12 October 2016 (UTC)
