The '''Highland Light Infantry''' was a [[Light infantry|light]] [[infantry]] [[regiment]] of the [[British Army]] formed in 1881. It took part in the [[First World War|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars, until it was amalgamated with the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] in 1959 to form the [[Royal Highland Fusiliers|Royal Highland Fusiliers (Princess Margaret's Own Glasgow and Ayrshire Regiment)]] which later merged with the [[Royal Scots Borderers]], the [[Black Watch|Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment)]], the [[Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)]] and the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] to form the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]], becoming the [[Royal Highland Fusiliers|2nd Battalion]] of the new regiment.

==History==
===Early history===
The regiment was formed as part of the [[Childers Reforms]] on 1 July 1881 by the amalgamation of the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st (Highland) Light Infantry]] (as the 1st Battalion) and the [[74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot]] (as the 2nd Battalion) as the city regiment of [[Glasgow]], absorbing local [[Militia]] and [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Rifle Volunteer]] units. Its exact status was ambiguous: although the regiment insisted on being classified as a non-kilted Highland regiment it recruited mainly from Glasgow in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Carman, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd Battalion saw action at the [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]] in September 1882 during the [[Anglo-Egyptian War]]: Lieutenant [[William Mordaunt Marsh Edwards|William Edwards]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=25198 |date=13 February 1883 |startpage=792 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion was stationed in England from 1883, but moved to India the following year. In February 1900 it departed from [[Colombo]] to return home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=19 February 1900 |page_number=9 |issue=36069| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief attempts failed, but the men of the Frankfurt trench refused to surrender. After refusing to surrender, the Germans stormed the trench and found only 15 wounded men alive, three of whom died soon afterwards. General [[Hubert Gough|Sir Hubert Gough]] praised their stand under Army Order 193.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glesga.ukpals.com/folk/forces5a.htm|title= Glesga Pals: 16th Battalion Highland Light Infantry|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the 17th (Service) Battalion were painted by the [[war artist]] [[Frederick Farrell]] in [[Flanders]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/visual/glasgows-forgotten-war-artist-fred-farrell.1400900405|title=Glasgow's forgotten war artist Fred Farrell|date=24 May 2014|work=[[Herald Scotland]]|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the regiment's title was expanded to the '''Highland Light Infantry (City of Glasgow Regiment)'''.&lt;ref&gt;Army Order 221/1923&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Niven]] was commissioned into the regiment in 1930 and served with the 2nd Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scottishmilitary.blogspot.co.uk/2010/12/whos-who-in-scottish-military-history_26.html|title=Who's Who in Scottish Military History - David Niven|publisher=Scottish Military History|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===

The 2nd Battalion moved to [[Egypt]] early in the war and saw action at the [[Battle of Keren]] in March 1941.&lt;ref name=rhfww2/&gt; It then transferred to the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] and saw combat at the [[Battle of Knightsbridge]] in June 1942 and the [[First Battle of El Alamein|Battle of Fuka]] in July 1942.&lt;ref name=rhfww2/&gt; It took part in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943 and, after a period in [[Yugoslavia]], [[Albania]] and [[Greece]], took part in the final advance into Northern Italy.&lt;ref name=rhfww2/&gt;

The 11th Battalion was converted to armour in 1942, becoming the 156th Regiment in the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], but with the men retaining their Highland Light Infantry cap badges on the black beret of the RAC.&lt;ref&gt;Forty, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the War===
The Highland Light Infantry was amalgamated with the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] in 1959 to form the [[Royal Highland Fusiliers]]. The regular 1st battalions of the two Regiments combined at [[Redford Barracks]], [[Edinburgh]] to form the 1st Battalion of the new regiment (1 RHF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/infantry/royal-highland-fusiliers.html|title=Royal Highland Fusiliers|publisher=British Army units 1945 on|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniform==
The HLI was the only regular Highland regiment to wear [[trews]] for full dress, until 1947 when kilts were authorised. An earlier exception was the [[Glasgow Highlanders]] who wore kilts and were a [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|territorial]] battalion within the HLI. The HLI's full dress in 1914 was an unusual one; comprising a dark green [[shako]] with diced border and green cords, scarlet doublet with buff facings and trews of the Mackenzie tartan. Officers wore plaids of the same tartan, while in drill order all ranks wore white shell jackets with trews and green glengarry caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DyWvI8qIKxkC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=%22glengarry%22+%22Highland+light+infantry%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UU3c8_Zm3s&amp;sig=pQz6GVYkorL838CNyOQVKrcWsBc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHzv20hcnMAhVLLcAKHX3CAQw4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22glengarry%22%20%22Highland%20light%20infantry%22&amp;f=false|title=Highland Light Infantry Chronicle (January 1905-October 1907)|page=50|publisher=Highland Light Infantry|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
