'''No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit''' (No.&amp;nbsp;2 OCU) is a fighter training unit of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Located at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales, the unit trains pilots to operate the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]], conducts refresher courses for pilots returning to the type, and trains future Hornet instructors. Pilots new to the Hornet enter No.&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;OCU after first qualifying to fly fast jets at [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;79 Squadron]] and undertaking initial fighter combat instruction at [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;76 Squadron]]. Once qualified on the F/A-18, they are posted to one of No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing's operational Hornet units, [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]], [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron]] or [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron]].

The unit was established as No.&amp;nbsp;2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU) in April 1942 at  [[Port Pirie]], South Australia, and relocated to [[Mildura Airport|RAAF Station Mildura]], Victoria, the following month. During World War&amp;nbsp;II, it provided training on a wide range of aircraft, including [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Kittyhawks]], [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeances]], [[Avro Anson]]s, [[CAC Boomerang]]s, [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s and [[Airspeed Oxford]]s. Disbanded in March 1947, No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU was re-formed at Williamtown in March 1952 in response to the demand for more highly trained pilots to serve in the [[Korean War]].  It was renamed No.&amp;nbsp;2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958, and since then has conducted training with the [[CAC Sabre]], [[Dassault Mirage III]], and [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi MB-326]], prior to taking delivery of the Hornet.

The role of No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (No.&amp;nbsp;2 OCU) is to &quot;support the preparation for and the conduct of effective airspace control, counter air strike and combat air support operations through the provision of trained personnel&quot;.&lt;ref name=2OCU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/Air-Command/Air-Combat-Group/No.-81-Wing-/No.-2-Operational-Conversion-Unit/?RAAF-WWOQ+z4Bhe3w0yWDjkZiAYKKz2+DBcuq |title=No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit|publisher= [[Royal Australian Air Force]]|accessdate= 25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales, it comes under the control of [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing]], part of [[Air Combat Group RAAF|Air Combat Group]].&lt;ref name=2OCU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/RAAFBases/New-South-Wales/RAAF-Base-Williamtown/?RAAF-hGKolBgcjFzkAjuJv83Grq59BEM+C152 |title=RAAF Base Williamtown|publisher= Royal Australian Air Force|accessdate= 22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;2 OCU is primarily responsible for conducting operational conversion courses on the RAAF's [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] multi-role fighter, which entered service in 1985. The unit takes students who have converted to fast jets with [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;79 Squadron]], located at [[RAAF Base Pearce]], Western Australia, and undergone lead-in fighter training at [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;76 Squadron]], based at Williamtown.&lt;ref name=2OCU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ANAO, ''Tactical Fighter Operations'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Most are new to operational flying, but some are &quot;retreads&quot; (experienced pilots converting from another aircraft type).&lt;ref name=AFT&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Air Force Today |volume=1 |issue=3|date=February 1997| title=Training Australia's fighter pilots|pages=19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As No.&amp;nbsp;2 OCU's instructors are among the RAAF's most experienced Hornet pilots, they often play a significant role developing new tactics, in cooperation with fighter combat instructors at other No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing units.&lt;ref name=Frawley /&gt;

No. 2 OCU operates both single-seat F/A-18A Hornets and two-seat F/A-18Bs.&lt;ref name=MuseumHornet&gt;{{cite web|title=F/A-18 Hornet|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series3/A21.htm|publisher=[[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The F/A-18B is largely identical to the A model aside from its dual cockpit, which reduces internal fuel capacity by about six per cent.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, ''Hornets Down Under'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft [[livery]] includes a yellow-and-black tail fin flash, the base featuring a yellow tiger's head outlined in black, with a red mouth, white fangs and white eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service'', pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; The unit crest shows a winged kangaroo carrying a [[Joey (marsupial)|joey]] in its pouch, symbolising &quot;'Mother Australia' flying with her young&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Crests tell history|magazine=RAAF News |volume=4 |issue=11|date= December 1962|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto is ''Juventus Non Sine Pinnis'' (&quot;The Young Shall Have Wings&quot;).&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;

Hornet conversion courses run for six months, after which graduates are posted to one of the RAAF's front-line fighter units, [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] or [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron]] at Williamtown, or [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], Northern Territory.&lt;ref name=MuseumHornet/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aviation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2011/11/newest-fa-18-hornet-pilots-put-through-their-paces/|title=Newest F/A-18 Hornet pilots put through their paces|work=[[Australian Aviation (magazine)|Australian Aviation]]|date=21 November 2011|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students must first gain their instrument rating on the Hornet, and are then taught basic fighter manoeuvres, air combat techniques, air-to-air gunnery, and air-to-ground tactics.&lt;ref name=AFT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frawley /&gt; The course culminates with Exercise High Sierra, a biannual event that was first run at [[Townsville]], Queensland, in 1986.&lt;ref name=Frawley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; The exercise lasts for two weeks and involves day and night flights, including precision strike [[sortie]]s with practice and live bombs.&lt;ref name=Aviation/&gt;

===Operational training: 1942–47===
[[File:AC0072JeffreyTruscottKittyhawks1942.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.28|left|Wing Commander Jeffrey (front) leading a flight of P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, including one flown by Squadron Leader [[Keith Truscott|&quot;Bluey&quot; Truscott]] (second from rear), at No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU, Mildura, in June 1942|alt=Four single-engined military monoplanes in flight]]
During World War&amp;nbsp;II, the RAAF established several operational training units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting techniques to the flying skills they had already learned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 167–168, 364&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU) was formed on 2&amp;nbsp;April 1942 at [[Port Pirie]], South Australia. Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Peter Jeffrey]], a [[Flying ace|fighter ace]] who had led No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]].&lt;ref name=Units&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey had recently brought on line Nos.&amp;nbsp;75 and 76 Squadrons, two of the first three fighter units raised to help defend northern Australia as the Japanese advanced toward New Guinea.&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt; His team of instructors at No.&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;OTU included fellow aces from the North African campaign, [[Clive Caldwell]] and [[Wilfred Arthur|Wilf Arthur]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Originally equipped with [[CAC Wirraway]]s and [[Fairey Battle]]s, the unit's complement was augmented by [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk variants|P-40 Kittyhawks]], [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeances]], [[Avro Anson]]s, [[CAC Boomerang]]s, [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s and [[Airspeed Oxford]]s after it relocated to [[Mildura Airport|RAAF Station Mildura]], Victoria, in May.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; By September 1942, its fleet of aircraft included nine of the 106 Kittyhawks the RAAF had on hand at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Spitfire, Mustang and Kittyhawk in Australian Service'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; During November, No.&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;OTU conducted comparative trials that pitted a Spitfire Mk&amp;nbsp;V against a P-40E; the final report of these trials judged that although the Spitfire had superior performance according to most criteria, the P-40E was also a useful design.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Spitfire, Mustang and Kittyhawk in Australian Service'', pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;OTU's Spitfire section was transferred to [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAAF Station Williamtown]], New South Wales, in March 1943, under the command of ace [[John Lloyd Waddy|John Waddy]].&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey handed over command of No.&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;OTU at Mildura in August 1943; the same month, the unit logged over 5,000 flying hours, its highest level during the war. For the remainder of the conflict it maintained an average strength of more than 100 aircraft.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; North African campaign aces and former No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron commanders [[Bobby Gibbes]] and [[Nicky Barr]] served successively as chief flying instructor from March 1944 until the end of the Pacific War.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, ''[[Who's Who in Australia]]'', p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dornan, ''Nicky Barr'', pp. 94–95, 263–266&lt;/ref&gt; Group Captain Arthur led the unit from July to November 1944, when Group Captain Jeffrey resumed command.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;  During 1945, the Spitfires and Kittyhawks were replaced by 32 [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Spitfire, Mustang and Kittyhawk in Australian Service'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Training concluded that October, following the cessation of hostilities, and No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU was reduced to a care-and-maintenance unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;2OCU&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; During the war, it had graduated 1,247 pilots, losing 45 students in fatal accidents.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; Jeffrey completed his appointment in June 1946, and the unit was disbanded on 25&amp;nbsp;March 1947.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1205998 |title=Jeffrey, Peter|work= World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate= 25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war [[demobilization|demobilisation]] saw the disbandment of all the RAAF's OTUs.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt; Operational conversion of new pilots then became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice disrupted the squadrons' normal duties, and the advent of the [[Korean War]] and the introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal system of operational training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt; According to [[Dick Cresswell]], commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron in Korea from September 1950 to August 1951:&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. xiii, 150&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is hard to believe that I actually sent 11 pilots home to Australia as they were not capable of doing the job properly. I don't blame the pilots, but I do blame the Air Force system. We had no operational training units, no operational training system and, as a result, the pilots came to Korea poorly trained and without instrument ratings. They just couldn't operate in the area.}}

The RAAF moved to rectify the situation by re-forming No.&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;OTU on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt; Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Vampire]] jets.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell took command of No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU on 21&amp;nbsp;May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor courses, as well as refresher courses on jets.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built [[CAC Sabre]] jet fighter to No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The [[flight (military unit)|flight]] was responsible for performance testing and developing combat flying techniques, in concert with the [[Aircraft Research and Development Unit RAAF|Aircraft Research and Development Unit]] (ARDU).&lt;ref name=Stephens348&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 348–349&lt;/ref&gt; On 3&amp;nbsp;December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier [[HMS Vengeance (R71)|HMAS ''Vengeance'']].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Training courses on the Sabre began on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1955.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; Once the Sabre entered operational service in March 1956, the Sabre Trials Flight was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron.&lt;ref name=Stephens348/&gt; Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;

In preparation for the introduction of the F/A-18 Hornet, No.&amp;nbsp;2 OCU temporarily ceased flying operations on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1985 and transferred Macchi and Mirage training to No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, which assumed responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susans, ''The RAAF Mirage Story'', pp. 90, 107&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on 17&amp;nbsp;May, the first fourteen Australian Hornets—seven single-seat F/A-18As and seven two-seat F/A-18Bs—and a Hornet simulator were delivered to No.&amp;nbsp;2 OCU.

Two Hornets collided during an air-to-air combat training exercise the previous year, but both managed to return to base.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The unit temporarily relocated to [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales, in July 1990, while Williamtown's runway was resurfaced.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The RAAF began modifying four of its [[Boeing 707]] jet transports to enable [[Aerial refueling|air-to-air refuelling]] of the Hornets in December 1988; No.&amp;nbsp;2 OCU staff commenced training for airborne tanker operations in July 1991, subsequently adding this capability to the Hornet conversion course.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1990s, the unit had 12 instructors and a complement of 18 Hornets, including 13 two-seaters. It was running two conversion courses per year, with eight students per course, and had an average failure rate of 10 per cent. Several of its instructors were US and Canadian pilots on exchange with the RAAF.&lt;ref name=AFT/&gt; In 2000, No.&amp;nbsp;2 OCU joined Nos.&amp;nbsp;76 and 79 Squadrons as part of [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing]], which had been re-established as an operational training formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Liebert|first=Simone|title=Cloudy day, bright outlook|magazine=[[Air Force (newspaper)|Air Force]]|url= http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4512/topstories/story02.htm|date=17 July 2003|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peacock; Jackson, ''Jane's World Air Forces'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, the unit had a strength of between 12 and 14 instructors and ran three Hornet conversion courses and one fighter combat instructor course over two-year cycles.
