The '''23rd Arkansas Infantry''' (1862–1865) was a [[Confederate Army]] [[infantry]] [[regiment]] during the [[American Civil War]]. In the summer of 1864, the unit was reorganized as a mounted infantry regiment in preparation for [[Price's Missouri Expedition]] and officially redesignated as the '''42nd Arkansas Infantry (Mounted)'''. The unit was often referred to as Lyle's Arkansas Cavalry in report from Price's Missouri Expedition. Due to its mounted status, the unit is also occasionally referred to as the '''23rd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwar.nps.gov/cwss/regiments.cfm National Park Service, Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System], Confederate Arkansas Troops, 23rd Regiment, Arkansas Cavalry. Retrieved 3 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The 23rd Arkansas, which was initially identified in Confederate reports as Adams Arkansas Battalion, was initially assigned to Brigadier General Darney H. Maury's Brigade of Major General Samuel Jones' Division of the [[Army of the West (1862)|Army of the West]], Major General [[Earl Van Dorn]] commanding.&lt;ref&gt;United States. War Dept.

Late April and early May 1862 the Confederate Army underwent an army-wide reorganization due to the passage of the Conscription Act by the Confederate Congress in April 1962.&lt;ref&gt;UPTON, EMORY, Bvt. Maj. Gen., United States Army; &quot;THE MILITARY POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES&quot; WASHINGTON GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 1912, Page 471, Congressional edition, Volume 6164, Google Books, Accessed 4 November 2011, https://books.google.com/books?id=2-tGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA471&amp;lpg=PA471&amp;dq=Confederate+conscription+law+reorganization+regiment&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7ptDBF0n2D&amp;sig=-K_6PQoHglmh_SOzuobv_JyNWUw&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Confederate%20conscription%20law%20reorganization%20regiment&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; All twelve-month regiments had to re-muster and enlist for three years or the duration of the war; a new election of officers was ordered; and men who were exempted from service by age or other reasons under the Conscription Act were allowed to take a discharge and go home. Officers who did not choose to stand for re-election were also offered a discharge.  The 23rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment was reorganized “for 3 years or the war” on May 27, 1862, at Camp Priceville, near Tupelo, Mississippi at which time Capt Thomas L. Westmoreland’s independent company was added, bringing the regiment up to full strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-sites&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odom, Danny, &quot;Re: 23rd Arkansas Infantry&quot; Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 21 May 2012, Accessed 23 May 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=26334&lt;/ref&gt;

The regiment reorganized again, pursuant to orders from General Maury, at [[Saltillo, Mississippi]], on September 10, 1862, when the understrength [[12th Arkansas Infantry Regiment|12th]] and [[14th Arkansas Infantry Regiment (Powers')|14th Arkansas Infantry Regiment]]s were field-consolidated with the 23rd Arkansas Regiment. When the regiment was reorganized the following field officers were elected:&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrell 321&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Park Service&quot;/&gt;

*Colonel Oliver P. Lyles, of Crittenden County.
*Lieutenant Colonel A. H. Pennington, of Clark County.
*Major Erastus L. Black, of Monroe County.
*Adjutant C. W. Lewis, of Crittenden County.
*Quartermaster McMurray, of Chicot County.
*Commissary Norton, of Phillips County.

During the Iuka-Corinth Campaign, the 23rd Arkansas was assigned to Brigadier General [[John C. Moore (general)|John C. Moore]]'s brigade of Brigadier General [[Dabney H. Maury]]'s Division, of Major General [[Sterling Price]]'s 1st Corps the Confederate ([[Army of the West (1862)|Army of the West]]). The unit fought in the battles at [[Second Battle of Corinth|Corinth]] and [[Battle of Hatchie's Bridge|Hatchie's Bridge]] and reported 5 killed, 23 wounded, and 116 missing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park Service&quot;/&gt;

Following the Iuka-Corinth Campaign, the regiment was assigned to Brigadier General William Beall's brigade, of Major General [[Franklin Gardner]]'s Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana and assigned to the garrison of [[Siege of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]]. Due to the unit's losses, it became involved in underwent several field consolidations with other units while assigned to the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. Field consolidations were considered to be temporary, and the component regiments continued to maintain separate muster rolls.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; On January 7, 1863 Major General [[Franklin Gardner]] issued General Order No. 5 which temporarily consolidated several under strength Arkansas units:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

The [[15th Arkansas Infantry Regiment (Johnson's)|Johnson's 15th Arkansas]] was assigned to Crockett's consolidated regiment instead of the 17th.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The regiment endured the forty-eight-day siege, and was surrendered to General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] on July 9, 1863. Following the surrender the officers were sent as prisoners to [[Johnson's Island|Johnson's Island Military Prison]]. The enlisted personnel of the 23rd Arkansas were paroled and returned to Arkansas. After being officially exchanged in the spring of 1864 the unit was converted to [[mounted infantry]] and took an active part in Price's Missouri Expedition. When the unit was paroled and exchanged back to Arkansas following its surrender at Port Hudson, a new Company H, from Craighead County, was added to replace the Clark County company, which did not rejoin the regiment after being exchanged.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-sites.com&quot;/&gt;

== Surrender ==
Brigadier General [[M. Jeff Thompson]], Commander of the Military Sub-District of Northeast Arkansas and Southeast Missouri, to which the regiment was assigned at the close of the war, surrendered his command at [[Chalk Bluff, Arkansas]] on May 11, 1865, and agreed to have his men assemble at Wittsburg and [[Jacksonport, Arkansas]] to lay down their arms and receive their paroles. Thompson's command was widely dispersed throughout northeast Arkansas, more for reasons of available forage than anything else.  Most members of the 23rd Arkansas surrendered and were paroled at Wittsburg on May 25, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Howerton, Bryan R. &quot;Re: Jacksonport 1865 surrender list?&quot;, Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 1 January 2004, Accessed 1 January 2012, http://history-sites.com/mb/cw/arcwmb/archive_index.cgi?noframes;read=6006&lt;/ref&gt;
