==Trivia==
*Ford Island was host to an annual &quot;Hydrofest&quot; where hydroplanes raced around the harbor.
*Hollywood actor [[William Joseph Hill]] grew up on Ford Island with his family. His father William Joseph Hill Sr. was a Captain in the U.S. Navy.
*Damage to structures on Ford Island during the Pearl Harbor attack was surprisingly minimal.  A bomb landed (probably by mistake) in the courtyard of the medical building, and windows in some buildings were shattered by the force of explosions on ships.
*[[Amelia Earhart]] crashed on takeoff from Luke Field during her first attempt at flying around the world.

: Although I understand the word &quot;trivia&quot; is not encyclopedic, actually some of those facts are quite applicable to Ford Island.  I lived there in 1991 and I remember the magnitude of those Hydrofoil races being held in the bay.  They were a really big deal drawing national networks and thousands of visitors -- at the time at least, the island was completely closed to civilians, except on those days.  The other facts are also interesting.  Ford Island conjures up a sense of history -- should we lose it?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.74.195.77|110.74.195.77]] ([[User talk:110.74.195.77|talk]]) 17:44, 22 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Possible wrong info about USS Missouri ==
The article states that the Missouri was called back into service due to the Gulf War (I).  I had a chance to serve on the Missouri when making duty station choices in March 1990, six months before the Gulf War and a lot more than that if you consider that the Missouri was already in service when I was choosing orders.  I don't believe the Missouri was called up because of Gulf I.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.74.195.77|110.74.195.77]] ([[User talk:110.74.195.77|talk]]) 17:53, 22 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Increased size? ==
In the section &quot;Army Air Service&quot;, there appears the following sentence:
: During the 1930s, the island's size was increased from 334 acres (135 ha) to 331 acres (134 ha) by using landfill from the dredging of Pearl Harbor.
Now I'll admit that it's been a few decades since my Elementary School arithmetic classes, but I believe 334 is larger than 331. Are the numbers reversed? Was the area of Ford island actually ''decreased''? Or maybe the second number should be larger than either 331 or 334. (Sorry, I don't have any books on either Ford Island or Pearl harbor, so I can't fix this problem myself.) -- [[User:Llywrch|llywrch]] ([[User talk:Llywrch|talk]]) 16:02, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

== Sourcing? ==

With the wide availability of scholarly literature about the attack on Pearl Harbor, why are we citing web pages from the Naval History &amp; Heritage Command?

::&lt;small&gt;Note:To be clear, I was not suggesting that BRD was being violated-just an ask to ensure that discussion is taking place now, thank you both! — [[User:Xaosflux|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FF9933; font-weight:bold; font-family:monotype;&quot;&gt;xaosflux&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Xaosflux|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00FF00;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:17, 7 December 2014 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

::I split off the material because I didn't see a reason why it couldn't be two separate articles. One issue I had was that the history was in multiple sections and interspersed with multiple topics. Granted, the timing might not have been perfect, but I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to do it when I was thinking about it, as I was ready to spend time into making sure that everything flowed perfectly and the disruption would have been minor to anyone reading the page. I'm not going to revert it now since I don't want to make tensions higher at the moment, but I do think there is a valid case for keeping an island article and one about a naval air facility that had a significant history separate, instead of on one page, as the facility article has great potential for expansion.
::TParis, no harm done with the message, as I understand where you were coming from there and I am willing to work with you to see this through, whatever consensus may turn out to be. [[User:Ktr101|Kevin Rutherford]] ([[User talk:Ktr101|talk]]) 21:50, 7 December 2014 (UTC)
:::I don't mind what happens to the article after it comes off the main page.  If you want to split it, that's fine.  I really don't think that's a great idea because there really is nothing differentiating that article from this one - only what the operations were umbrella-ed under at the time.  The timeline would be missing a large chunk unless you wrote a summary for that part.  Either way, if you at least wait until tomorrow then you won't get as many objections from me.--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 21:53, 7 December 2014 (UTC)
::::Regarding the separate Naval history.  That history extends from 1939 to present - not just the time it was a NALF.  It was called different things, but you'd be taking out the chunk of time when the ''least'' happened on the island.  Most of the active components had moved off the island by that time and remaining activity was dwindling.  There wouldn't but much to write.--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 22:22, 7 December 2014 (UTC)
:::::That works for me. I'll wait a few days until it comes off of the links, and I'll split it after that, and then see if I can find any information that fills in some of the missing parts. [[User:Ktr101|Kevin Rutherford]] ([[User talk:Ktr101|talk]]) 23:23, 7 December 2014 (UTC)
::::::Fair enough, thanks.  On another note, [[Fort Kamehameha]] is going to be my next project if you are looking for something to do.--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 23:29, 7 December 2014 (UTC)

== Add &quot;Verify source&quot; for VP-8 ==
{{Resolved}}
In &quot;[[Ford Island#Army Air Service|Army Air Service]]&quot; section, [[VP-8]] was arrived in island in 1933. However, VP-8 was established in 1942. and  &quot;[http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/hawaii-airfields-airports/oahu-pre-world-war-ii/History%20of%20NAS%20128%20%28PH%29%201945.pdf History of Naval Air Station, Navy Number 128]&quot; P.4 was wrote &quot;In 1933, the first PB2Y2's were flown here by VP-10&quot;, but at that time [[Consolidated PB2Y Coronado|PB2Y2]] was not rounded out. Would you verify this sentence? --[[User:おてんきや|Otenkiya]] ([[User talk:おてんきや|talk]]) 01:44, 11 June 2015 (UTC)

If VP-8 was created in 1942, don't you think this 1945 document would have been aware of that?--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 20:46, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
::According to [http://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/vp8/my%20webpage/squadron.htm this source], the &quot;Second VP-8&quot; was commissioned as VP-201 in 1942 and became VP-8 in 1948 - 3 years after the above document was published.  Clearly, the 1945 document is referring to a squadron that doesn't follow this lineage.  Googling more...--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 20:52, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
:::According to [http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/naval-aviation-history/dictionary-of-american-naval-aviation-squadrons-volume-2/chapter-3-patrol-squadron-vp-histories-2nd-vp-5-to-2nd-vp-8.html this source], page 64, the 1942 squadron was &quot;Redesignated Patrol Squadron EIGHT (VP-8) on 1 September 1948, the second squadron to be assigned the VP-8 designation.&quot;--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 20:54, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
::::{{reply to|おてんきや}} Found the First VP-8.  Page 113 (or document page 10): [http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/naval-aviation-history/dictionary-of-american-naval-aviation-squadrons-volume-2/chapter-3-patrol-squadron-vp-histories-3rd-vp-18-to-1st-vp-22.html].  The First VP-8 was established in 1929 and became the Third VP-20.  But in 1933, it was VP-8F, and became VP-8 in 1937.  Could you please remove the maintenance tag now that this is resolved?--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 20:59, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
:::::{{Resolved mark large}} OK. I have understood the problem of VP-8 completely. Verification will be removed in appreciation of your cooperation and correction of the link. Thanks everybady. --[[User:おてんきや|Otenkiya]] ([[User talk:おてんきや|talk]]) 03:40, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
