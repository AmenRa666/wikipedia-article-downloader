Sergeant '''Nachshon Mordechai Wachsman''' ({{lang-he|נחשון מרדכי וקסמן}}, born April 3, 1975, died October 14, 1994) was an [[Israeli Defense Force|IDF]] soldier who was kidnapped and held hostage by [[Hamas]] for a period of 6 days.

A [[Multiple citizenship|dual]] citizen of [[Israel]] and the United States, Wachsman was raised in [[Jerusalem]]. He was the third of seven sons born to Yehuda and Esther Wachsman. His father was Israeli-born, while his mother was born in a German [[displaced persons camp]] and immigrated to Israel from [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=OU&gt;[http://www.ou.org/yerushalayim/yomhazikaron/wachsman.htm His Name was Nachshon Wachsman] OU.org&lt;/ref&gt; Wachsman volunteered for an elite commando unit of the [[Golani Brigade]], serving in the [[Orev Golani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/148743 |title=Reflections: The Wachsman Kidnapping – Inside Israel  |publisher=Arutz Sheva |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping==
At home on a leave, Wachsman was instructed by the military to attend a one-day training course in [[northern Israel]].  He left Saturday night after [[Shabbat]], telling his parents he would return Sunday night, October 9, 1994. He was last seen by a friend who reported that, after completing the training, Wachsman had been dropped off at the [[Bnai Atarot junction]], a highly populated area in central Israel, where he could either catch a bus or [[hitchhike]], a common practice of Israeli soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Post]], [http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?id=268916 IDF launches campaign against hitchhiking], June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=&quot;ynetnews1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3684709,00.html |title=Nachshon Wachsman |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=October 9, 1994 |accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli intelligence learned that Wachsman entered a car in which there were Hamas militants wearing [[kippot]], who had a [[Tanakh]] and [[siddur]] on the dashboard, and [[Chassidic]] music playing.&lt;ref name=OU/&gt;

[[Mohammed Deif]] stated that he was the commander of the operation to abduct Wachsman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=12721 Hamas' True Terrorist Leader] FrontPage Magazine, March 29, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hostage tape===
On October 11, 1994, a videotape was broadcast showing Wachsman, with his hands and feet bound, before a [[keffiyeh]]-covered militant who was displaying Wachsman's identity card. After the militant recited the hostage's home address and identity number, Wachsman spoke, with the armed militant behind him, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The group from Hamas kidnapped me. They are demanding the release of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and another 200 from Israeli prison. If their demands are not met, they will execute me on Friday at 8 P.M.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ynetnews1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nachshon's parents personally appealed to world leaders, including Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], US President [[Bill Clinton]], and Muslim religious leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;ynetnews1&quot;/&gt;

On October 14, 1994, with 24 hours until the ultimatum, prayer vigils were held in many places. Over 100,000 people representing all religious, political, and social segments of the Israeli population gathered at the [[Western Wall]]. Responding to a request by Esther Wachsman, Nachshon’s mother, many women lit an extra Sabbath candle for her son.&lt;ref name=OU/&gt;

==Rescue attempt==
In the meantime, the Israeli military had captured Jihad Yarmur, the driver of the car that had picked up Wachsman.&lt;ref name=OU/&gt; Interrogating Yarmur, they learned that Wachsman was being held in the village of [[Bir Nabala]], a location under Israeli control located only ten minutes away from Wachsman's home in the [[Ramot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem. Prime Minister Rabin authorized a military rescue attempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;ynetnews1&quot;/&gt;

On Friday October 14 [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Shimon Peres]], and [[Yasser Arafat]] announced that they had won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. When Peres was asked his opinion on the &quot;peace&quot; that he had achieved in Oslo in light of Hamas' impending deadline, he responded that the peace process involves &quot;calculated risks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishledger.com/articles/2006/07/18/opinions/edit05.txt |title=No strength for silence 
  |publisher=jewishledger.com |date= |accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 20:00 that night, at the hour of the ultimatum, elite IDF commandos from the [[Sayeret Matkal]] special forces unit carried out an operation to free Wachsman. It was thought that Wachsman was being held behind an iron door, but in fact it was a solid steel door, and the first explosion only dented the iron door. The commandos immediately lost the element of surprise, giving Wachsman's captors inside time to shoot him dead and position themselves for the impending firefight. A second explosive charge was prepared and the door was finally blasted open after more than a minute, and after a heavy exchange of fire with gunmen waiting on the stairwell, the commandos reached a second iron door, and had to wait another four minutes for the charges to be set. During this time, the commandos shouted to the gunmen inside to surrender, while the gunmen replied that Waschsman was already dead and that they preferred to die. After the team broke through the door, another exchange of fire took place before the room was secured. In total, three gunmen were killed and two taken prisoner, while the leader of the commando team, Captain [[Nir Poraz]] was killed and nine commandos were wounded. Wachsman was found dead in the room. His body was slumped in a chair, wearing a kafiyeh and civilian clothes. He had been shot in the throat and chest at close range.&lt;ref name=&quot;ynetnews1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxnDe_kPDjMC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Nachshon+Wachsman+killed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JX_qSf818L&amp;sig=g_y2ZAs2M7Q6Qaz8HZp_Scom1Lk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e-ylU56qKrPjsASXo4HgBQ&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=Nachshon%20Wachsman%20killed&amp;f=false |title=Negotiating Under Fire: Preserving Peace Talks in the Face of Terror Attacks |author=Matthew Levitt |publisher= |date= |accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wachsman family was informed of his death personally by General [[Yoram Yair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/terror_94/year.html 1995 April: Patterns of global terrorism, 1994] US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Funeral===
Wachsman was buried on Saturday night October 15, 1994 in the [[Mount Herzl]] military cemetery.&lt;ref name=OU/&gt;

Wachsman's [[Rosh Yeshiva]], Rabbi [[Mordechai Elon]], gave his eulogy. At the request of Wachsman's bereaved father, the rabbi told the crowd of mourners that God did listen to their prayers, and that just as a father would always like to say &quot;yes&quot; to all of his children's requests, sometimes he must say &quot;no&quot; though the child might not understand why. &quot;So too our Father in Heaven heard our prayers, and though we don't understand why, His answer was 'no.'&quot;&lt;ref name=OU/&gt;

===Beit Nachshon===
Today &quot;Beit Nachshon&quot; at the [[SHALVA]] Center in Jerusalem, an association for mentally and physically challenged children, is dedicated to Wachsman's memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shalva.org/page.asp?id=1826|title=SHALVA Jerusalem - Shalva : The Association for Mentally &amp; Physically Challenged Children in Israel|website=www.shalva.org|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driver convicted and imprisoned; released in Shalit exchange===
Jihad Yarmur was convicted of the murder of Nachshon Wachsman. He was released in October 2011 in exchange for the release of captive Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=241639 |title=Planners of Park Hotel bombing attack ‘set to go free' |first=Yaakov |last=Lappin |date=October 13, 2011 |newspaper=Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
