'''HMS ''Temeraire''''' was a 98-gun [[second-rate]] [[ship of the line]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. Launched in 1798, she served during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], mostly on blockades or convoy escort duties. She fought only one fleet action, the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], but became so well known for her actions and her subsequent depictions in art and literature that she has been remembered as &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot;.

Built at [[Chatham Dockyard]], ''Temeraire'' entered service on the [[Brest, France|Brest]] blockade with the [[Channel Fleet]]. Missions were tedious and seldom relieved by any action with the French fleet. The first incident of note came when several of her crew, hearing rumours they were to be sent to the [[West Indies]] at a time when peace with France seemed imminent, refused to obey orders. This act of mutiny eventually failed and a number of those responsible were tried and executed. Laid up during the [[Peace of Amiens]], ''Temeraire'' returned to active service with the resumption of the wars with France, again serving with the [[Channel Fleet]], and joined [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson's]] blockade of the Franco-Spanish fleet in [[Cadiz]] in 1805. At the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, the ship went into action immediately astern of Nelson's flagship, {{HMS|Victory}}. During the battle ''Temeraire'' came to the rescue of the beleaguered ''Victory'', and fought and captured two French ships, winning public renown in Britain.

After undergoing substantial repairs, ''Temeraire'' was employed blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She went out to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 was off the Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off [[Toulon]], when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the [[River Tamar]] until 1819. Further service brought her to [[Sheerness]] as a [[receiving ship]], then a [[Depot ship|victualling depot]], and finally a [[guard ship]]. The [[Admiralty]] ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up.

This final voyage was depicted in a [[J. M. W. Turner]] oil painting greeted with critical acclaim, entitled ''[[The Fighting Temeraire|The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up, 1838]]''. The painting continues to be held in high regard and was voted Britain's favourite painting in 2005.

==Construction and commissioning==
[[File:Neptune class plan.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of the plan of the side of the hull of a sailing ship, without masts shown.|Admiralty plan for a 98-gun ship of the line of the ''Neptune'' class. This represents the design for {{HMS|Dreadnought|1801|6}}, drawn up by the [[Navy Board|Navy Office]] and dated 22 July 1789.]]
''Temeraire'' was ordered from [[Chatham Dockyard]] on 9 December 1790, to a design developed by [[Surveyor of the Navy]] [[John Henslow (Surveyor of the Navy)|Sir John Henslow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lavery&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lavery |title=The Ship of the Line|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of three ships of the [[Neptune class ship of the line|''Neptune'' class]], alongside her sisters {{HMS|Neptune|1797|6}} and {{HMS|Dreadnought|1801|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} The [[keel]] was laid down at Chatham in July 1793. Her construction was initially overseen by Master Shipwright Thomas Pollard and completed by his successor Edward Sison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships in the Age of Sail 1793–1817|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Temeraire'' was launched on 11 September 1798 and the following day was taken into the [[graving dock]] to be fitted for sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colledge&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Colledge &amp; Warlow|title=Ships of the Royal Navy|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hull was fitted with [[copper sheathing]], a process that took two weeks to complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin41&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=The Ships of Trafalgar|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refloated, she finished fitting out, and received her masts and yards. Her final costs came to £73,241, and included £59,428 spent on the hull, masts and yards, and a further £13,813 on rigging and stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin41&quot;/&gt;

She was commissioned on 21 March 1799 under Captain [[Peter Puget]], becoming the second ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name ''Temeraire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin41&quot;/&gt; Her predecessor had been the 74-gun [[third-rate]] {{HMS|Temeraire|1759|6}}, a former French ship taken as a [[prize (law)|prize]] at the [[Battle of Lagos]] on 19 August 1759 by a fleet under Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colledge&quot;/&gt;{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} Puget was only in command until 26 July 1799, during which time he oversaw the process of fitting the new ''Temeraire'' for sea. He was superseded by Captain [[Thomas Eyles]] on 27 July 1799, while the vessel was anchored off [[St Helens, Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=The Ships of Trafalgar|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==With the Channel Fleet==
Under Eyles's command ''Temeraire'' finally put to sea at the end of July, flying the flag of Rear Admiral [[Sir John Borlase Warren, 1st Baronet|Sir John Borlase Warren]], and joined the [[Channel Fleet]] under the overall command of Admiral [[Alexander Hood, Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt; The Channel Fleet was at that time principally engaged in the blockade of the French port of [[Brest, France|Brest]], and ''Temeraire'' spent several long cruises of two or three months at a time patrolling the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt; Eyles was superseded during this period by ''Temeraire''{{'}}s former commander, Captain Puget, who resumed command on 14 October 1799, and the following month ''Temeraire'' became the flagship of Rear Admiral [[James Hawkins-Whitshed|James Whitshed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt;

Lord Bridport had been replaced as commander of the Channel Fleet by Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl St Vincent|Lord St Vincent]] in mid-1799, and the long blockade cruises were sustained throughout the winter and into the following year. On 20 April 1800 Puget was superseded as commander by Captain Edward Marsh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt; Marsh commanded ''Temeraire'' through the remainder of that year and for the first half of 1801, until his replacement, Captain Thomas Eyles, arrived to resume command on 31 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt; Rear Admiral Whitshed had also struck his flag by now, and ''Temeraire'' became the flagship of Rear Admiral [[George Campbell (Royal Navy officer)|George Campbell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt; By this time the [[Second Coalition]] against France had collapsed, and negotiations for peace were underway at [[Amiens]]. Lord St Vincent had been promoted to [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], and command of the Channel Fleet passed to Admiral [[William Cornwallis|Sir William Cornwallis]]. With the end of the war imminent, ''Temeraire'' was taken off blockade duty and sent to [[Bantry Bay]] to await the arrival of a convoy, which she would then escort to the West Indies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt; Many of the crew had been serving continuously in the navy since the start of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, and had looked forward to returning to England now that peace seemed imminent. On hearing rumours that instead they were to be sent to the West Indies, around a dozen men began to agitate for the rest of the crew to refuse orders to sail for anywhere but England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis150&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutiny==
The first open clash between the mutineers and officers came on the morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the [[forecastle]] and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that ''Temeraire'' would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis150&quot;/&gt; The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined that the majority of the crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that the ''Temeraire''{{'}}s crew would be supported by the ship's [[Royal Marines|marines]] as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis151-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|pages=151–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's [[gunport]]s, effectively barricading themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders to open them again, jeered the officers and threatened violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis157&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine as much as they could.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis158&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alarmed by the actions of the ''Temeraire''{{'}}s crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral [[Andrew Mitchell (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Andrew Mitchell]] the following day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the [[Admiralty]] while Campbell returned to ''Temeraire'' and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis160&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of the officers were struck by rowdy seamen. When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis161&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push and threaten them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though the officers were on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis162&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the mutiny created a sensation in England, and the Admiralty ordered ''Temeraire'' to sail immediately for [[Spithead]] while an investigation was carried out. Vice-Admiral Mitchell was granted extraordinary powers regarding the [[capital punishment|death sentence]] and ''Temeraire''{{'}}s marine complement was hastily augmented for the voyage to England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis164&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ship's arrival, the 14 imprisoned ringleaders were swiftly court-martialled in [[Portsmouth]] aboard {{HMS|Gladiator|1783|6}}, some on 6 January 1802 and the rest on 14 January.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis167&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; After deliberations, twelve were sentenced to be hanged, and the remaining two were to receive two hundred lashes each.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis167&quot;/&gt;{{Ref_label|C|c|none}} Four men were duly hanged aboard ''Temeraire'', and the remainder were hanged aboard several of the ships anchored at Portsmouth, including {{HMS|Majestic|1785|6}}, {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}}, {{HMS|Achille|1798|6}} and {{HMS|Centaur|1797|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis168&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Indies and the peace==
After the executions, ''Temeraire'' was immediately sent to sea, sailing from Portsmouth for the [[Isle of Wight]] the day after and beginning preparations for her delayed voyage to the West Indies. She sailed for [[Barbados]], arriving there on 24 February, and remained in the West Indies until the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis169&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time there the [[Treaty of Amiens]] was finally signed and ratified, and ''Temeraire'' was ordered back to Britain. She arrived at [[Plymouth]] on 28 September and Eyles [[Ship decommissioning|paid her off]] on 5 October. Because of the drawdown in the size of the active navy as a result of the peace, ''Temeraire'' was laid up in the [[Hamoaze]] for the next eighteen months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt;

==Return to service==
The peace of Amiens was a brief interlude in the wars with Revolutionary France, and in 1803 the [[War of the Third Coalition]] began. ''Temeraire'' had deteriorated substantially during her long period spent laid up, and she was taken into dry dock on 22 May to repair and refit, starting with the replacement of her copper sheathing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis175&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work was delayed when a heavy storm hit Plymouth in January 1804, causing appreciable damage to ''Temeraire'', but was finally completed by February 1804, at a cost of £16,898.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt; Command was assigned to Captain [[Eliab Harvey]], and he arrived to take up his commission on 1 January 1804. On putting to sea he sailed to join the Channel Fleet, still under the overall command of Admiral Cornwallis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis176&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Temeraire'' now resumed her previous duties blockading the French at Brest. Heavy weather took its toll, forcing her to put into [[Torbay]] for extensive repairs after her long patrols, repairs which eventually amounted to £9,143.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis177&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Harvey was often absent from his command, usually attending to his duties as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|Essex]]. He was temporarily replaced by Captain William Kelly on 27 August 1804, and he in turn was succeeded by Captain George Fawke on 6 April 1805.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin42&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis179&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey returned to his ship on 9 July 1805, and it was while he was in command that the reinforced [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Robert Calder|Sir Robert Calder]] intercepted and attacked a Franco-Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]]. The French commander, [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]], was thwarted in his attempt to join the French forces at Brest, and instead sailed south to [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]], and then to [[Cadiz]]. When news of the Franco-Spanish fleet's location reached the Admiralty, they appointed Vice-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] to take command of the blockading force at Cadiz, which at the time was being commanded by Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. Nelson was told to pick whichever ships he liked to serve under him, and one of those he specifically chose was ''Temeraire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis181&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of Trafalgar==
''Temeraire'' duly received orders to join the Cadiz blockade, and having sailed to rendezvous with Collingwood, Harvey awaited Nelson's arrival. Nelson's flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Victory}}, arrived off Cadiz on 28 September, and he took over command of the fleet from Collingwood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis182&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next few weeks forming his plan of attack in preparation for the expected sortie of the Franco-Spanish fleet, issuing it to his captains on 9 October in the form of a memorandum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis182&quot;/&gt; The memorandum called for two divisions of ships to attack at right angles to the enemy line, severing its van from the centre and rear. A third advance squadron would be deployed as a reserve, with the ability to join one of the lines as the course of the battle dictated. Nelson placed the largest and most powerful ships at the heads of the lines, with ''Temeraire'' assigned to lead Nelson's own column into battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis182&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C&amp;C135&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Clayton &amp; Craig |title=Trafalgar|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fleet patrolled a considerable distance from the Spanish coast to lure the combined fleet out, and the ships took the opportunity to exercise and prepare for the coming battle. For ''Temeraire'' this probably involved painting her sides in the [[Nelson Chequer]] design, to enable the British ships to tell friend from foe in the confusion of battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis182&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Battle of Trafalgar, Plate 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Chart of a naval battle, inset showing the location off the south-western coast of Spain. One fleet shown in a line on the right hand side running top to bottom, the other divided into two lines at right angles to the first.|An 1848 plan of the fleet positions at the Battle of Trafalgar. ''Temeraire'' forms part of the weather column, and is depicted abreast of the ''Victory'', racing her for the Franco-Spanish line.]]
The combined fleet put to sea on 19 October 1805, and by 21 October was in sight of the British ships. Nelson formed up his lines and the British began to converge on the distant Franco-Spanish fleet. Contrary to his original instructions, Nelson took the lead of the weather column in ''Victory''. Concerned for the commander-in-chief's safety in such an exposed position, [[Henry Blackwood]], a long-standing friend of Nelson and commander of the frigate {{HMS|Euryalus|1803|6}} that day, suggested that Nelson come aboard his ship to better observe and direct the battle. Nelson refused, so Blackwood instead tried to convince him to let Harvey come past him in the ''Temeraire'', and so lead the column into battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&amp;C135&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis186&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson agreed to this, and signalled for Harvey to come past him. As ''Temeraire'' drew up towards ''Victory'', Nelson decided that if he was standing aside to let another ship lead his line, so too should Collingwood, commanding the lee column of ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis187&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signalled Collingwood, aboard his flagship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}, to let another ship come ahead of him, but Collingwood continued to surge ahead. Reconsidering his plan, Nelson is reported to have hailed the ''Temeraire'', as she came up alongside ''Victory'', with the words &quot;I'll thank you, Captain Harvey, to keep in your proper station, which is ''astern'' of the Victory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman, Nelson p621&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Oman|title=Nelson|page=621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson's instruction was followed up by a formal signal and Harvey dropped back reluctantly, but otherwise kept within one ship's length of ''Victory'' as she sailed up to the Franco-Spanish line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis188&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely following ''Victory'' as she passed through the Franco-Spanish line across the bows of the French flagship [[French ship Bucentaure (1803)|''Bucentaure'']], Harvey was forced to sheer away quickly, just missing ''Victory''{{'}}s stern. Turning to starboard, Harvey made for the 140-gun Spanish ship [[Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de la Santísima Trinidad|''Santísima Trinidad'']] and engaged her for twenty minutes, taking raking fire from two French ships, the 80-gun [[French ship Neptune (1803)|''Neptune'']] and the 74-gun [[French ship Redoutable (1791)|''Redoutable'']], as she did so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis190&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin43&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=The Ships of Trafalgar|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Redoutable''{{'}}s broadside carried away ''Temeraire''{{'}}s mizzen topmast, and while avoiding a broadside from ''Neptune'', ''Temeraire'' narrowly avoided a collision with ''Redoutable''. Another broadside from ''Neptune'' brought down ''Temeraire''{{'}}s fore-yard and main topmast, and damaged her fore mast and bowsprit. Harvey now became aware that the ''Redoutable'' had come up alongside the ''Victory'' and swept her decks with musket fire and grenades. A large party of Frenchmen now gathered on her decks ready to board the ''Victory''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis190&quot;/&gt; ''Temeraire'' was brought around; appearing suddenly out of the smoke of the battle and slipping across ''Redoutable''{{'}}s stern, ''Temeraire'' discharged a [[double-shotted]] broadside into her. [[Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas]], captain of the ''Redoutable'', recorded that &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the three-decker [''Temeraire'']&amp;nbsp;– who had doubtless perceived that the ''Victory'' had ceased fire and would inevitably be taken – ran foul of the ''Redoutable'' to starboard and overwhelmed us with the point-blank fire of all her guns. It would be impossible to describe the horrible carnage produced by the murderous broadside of this ship. More than two hundred of our brave lads were killed or wounded by it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Warwick200-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Warwick |title=Voices from the Battle of Trafalgar|pages=200–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Temeraire'' and ''Redoutable''===
[[File:The Battle of Trafalgar by William Clarkson Stanfield.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of a naval battle, four sailing ships on a choppy sea, obscured by smoke, figures visible on the decks and in the rigging.|''The Battle of Trafalgar'', 1836 oil on canvas by [[Clarkson Frederick Stanfield]]. Stanfield shows the damaged ''Redoutable'' caught between the ''Victory'' (foreground) and the ''Temeraire'' (seen bow on). The ''Fougueux'', coming up on ''Temeraire''{{'}}s starboard side, has just received a broadside.]]
''Temeraire'' then rammed into the ''Redoutable'', dismounting many of the French ship's guns, and worked her way alongside, after which her crew lashed the two ships together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis191&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Temeraire'' now poured continuous broadsides into the French ship, taking fire as she did so from the 112-gun Spanish ship [[Spanish ship Santa Ana (1784)|''Santa Ana'']] lying off her stern, and from the 74-gun French ship [[French ship Fougueux (1785)|''Fougueux'']], which came up on ''Temeraire''{{'}}s un-engaged starboard side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis193&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey ordered his gun crews to hold fire until ''Fougueux'' came within point blank range. ''Temeraire''{{'}}s first broadside against ''Fougueux'' at a range of 100&amp;nbsp;yards caused considerable damage to the Frenchman's rigging, and she drifted into ''Temeraire'', whose crew promptly lashed her to the side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardiner|title=The Campaign of Trafalgar 1803–1805|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Temeraire'' was now lying between two French 74-gun ships. As Harvey later recalled in a letter to his wife &quot;Perhaps never was a ship so circumstanced as mine, to have for more than three hours two of the enemy's line of battle ships lashed to her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis193&quot;/&gt; ''Redoutable'', sandwiched between ''Victory'' and ''Temeraire'', suffered heavy casualties, reported by Captain Lucas as amounting to 300 dead and 222 wounded. During the fight grenades thrown from the decks and topmasts of ''Redoutable'' killed and wounded a number of ''Temeraire''{{'}}s crew and set her starboard rigging and foresail on fire. There was a brief pause in the fighting while both sides worked to douse the flames.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warwick213&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Warwick |title=Voices from the Battle of Trafalgar|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Temeraire'' narrowly escaped destruction when a grenade thrown from ''Redoutable'' exploded on her maindeck, nearly igniting the after-magazine. Master-At-Arms John Toohig prevented the fire from spreading and saved not only ''Temeraire'', but the surrounding ships, which would have been caught in the explosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warwick213&quot;/&gt;

After twenty minutes fighting both ''Victory'' and ''Temeraire'', the ''Redoutable'' had been reduced to a floating wreck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warwick211&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Warwick |title=Voices from the Battle of Trafalgar|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} ''Temeraire'' had also suffered heavily, damaged when ''Redoutable''{{'}}s main mast fell onto her [[poop deck]], and having had her own topmasts shot away.{{Ref_label|E|e|none}} Informed that his ship was in danger of sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to the ''Temeraire''. Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis191&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C&amp;C211&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Clayton &amp; Craig |title=Trafalgar|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Temeraire'' and ''Fougueux''===
Lashed together, ''Temeraire'' and ''Fougueux'' exchanged fire, ''Temeraire'' initially clearing the French ship's upper deck with small arms fire. The French rallied, but the greater height of the three-decked ''Temeraire'' compared to the two-decked ''Fougueux'' thwarted their attempts to board. Instead Harvey dispatched his own boarding party, led by First-Lieutenant [[Thomas Fortescue Kennedy]], which entered ''Fougueux'' via her main deck ports and [[Chains (nautical)|chains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis193&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkin508&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion|page=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French tried to defend the decks port by port, but were steadily overwhelmed. ''Fougueux''{{'}}s captain, [[Louis Alexis Baudoin]], had suffered a fatal wound earlier in the fighting, leaving Commander Francois Bazin in charge. When he learned that nearly all of the officers were dead or wounded and that most of the guns were out of action, Bazin surrendered the ship to the boarders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis194&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C&amp;C210&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Clayton &amp; Craig |title=Trafalgar|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Temeraire'' had by now fought both French ships to a standstill, at considerable cost to herself. She had sustained casualties of 47 killed and 76 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkin508&quot;/&gt; All her sails and yards had been destroyed, only her lower masts remained, and the [[rudder|rudder head]] and starboard [[cathead]] had been shot away. Eight feet of her starboard hull was staved in and both [[Sternwalk|quarter galleries]] had been destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis194&quot;/&gt; Harvey signalled for a frigate to tow his damaged ship out of the line, and {{HMS|Sirius|1797|6}} came up to assist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis195&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before ''Sirius'' could make contact, ''Temeraire'' came under fire from a counter-attack by the as-yet unengaged van of the combined fleet, led by Rear Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis195&quot;/&gt;  Harvey ordered that the few guns that could be brought to bear be fired in response, and the attack was eventually beaten off by fresh British ships arriving on the scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis195&quot;/&gt;

==Storm==
Shortly after the battle had ended, a severe gale struck the area. Several of the captured French and Spanish ships foundered in the rising seas, including both of ''Temeraire''{{'}}s prizes, the ''Fougueux'' and the ''Redoutable''. Lost in the wrecks were a considerable number of their crews, as well as 47 ''Temeraire'' crewmen, serving as prize crews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin44&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=The Ships of Trafalgar|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Temeraire'' rode out the storm following the battle, sometimes being taken in tow by less damaged ships, sometimes riding at anchor. She took aboard a number of Spanish and French prisoners transferred from other prizes, including some transferred from the ''Euryalus'', which was serving as the temporary flagship of Cuthbert Collingwood. Harvey took the opportunity to go aboard the ''Euryalus'' and present his account of the battle to Collingwood, and so became the only captain to do so before Collingwood wrote his dispatch about the victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin44&quot;/&gt;

===Return to England===
''Temeraire'' finally put into Gibraltar on 2 November, eleven days after the battle had been fought. After undergoing minor repairs she sailed for England, arriving at Portsmouth on 1 December, three days before ''Victory'' passed by carrying Nelson's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis199&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle-damaged ships quickly became tourist attractions, and visitors flocked to tour them. ''Temeraire'' was particularly popular on her arrival, being the only ship singled out by name in Collingwood's dispatch for her heroic conduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis198&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collingwood wrote
&lt;blockquote&gt;A circumstance occurred during the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the ''Temeraire'' was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, in the end the combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis198&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report in the immediate aftermath of the battle, contained several errors. ''Temeraire'' had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing ''Temeraire''{{'}}s decks of enemy seamen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warwick212&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Warwick |title=Voices from the Battle of Trafalgar|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harvey of the Temeraire at Trafalgar.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Print of a group of men fighting on the decks of a ship, with swords and guns, two figures in officer's uniforms in the centre in hand-to-hand combat|''The Battle of Trafalgar. Captain Harvey of the Temeraire&amp;nbsp;... clearing the deck of the French and Spaniards&amp;nbsp;...'', a popular engraving of 1806 based on Collingwood's dispatch, depicting a highly fictionalised version of events]]
A number of artists visited the newly returned Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the [[Royal Naval Academy]]. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, sending them to [[Nicholas Pocock]] to be used for Pocock's large paintings of the battle. ''Temeraire'' was one of the ships he sketched.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis200&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another visitor to Portsmouth was [[J. M. W. Turner]]. It is not known whether he visited ''Temeraire'', though he did go aboard ''Victory'', making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors who had been in the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis201&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the ''Temeraire'' had become firmly ingrained in the public mind, so much so that when the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the ''Temeraire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis201&quot;/&gt;

==Mediterranean and Baltic service==
The battle-damaged ''Temeraire'' was almost immediately dry-docked in Portsmouth to undergo substantial repairs, which eventually lasted sixteen months and cost £25,352.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis210&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; She finally left the dockyard in mid-1807, now under the command of Captain [[Sir Charles Hamilton, 2nd Baronet, of Trebinshun House|Sir Charles Hamilton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin44&quot;/&gt; Having fitted her for sea, Hamilton sailed to the Mediterranean in September and joined the fleet blockading the French in Toulon. The service was largely uneventful, and ''Temeraire'' returned to Britain in April 1808 to undergo repairs at Plymouth. During her time in Britain the strategic situation in Europe changed as Spain rebelled against French domination and entered the war against France. ''Temeraire'' sailed in June to join naval forces operating off the Spanish coast in support of anti-French forces in the [[Peninsular War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin44&quot;/&gt;

This service continued until early 1809, when she returned to Britain. By now Britain was heavily involved in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], protecting mercantile interests. An expedition under [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Sir James Gambier]] in July 1807 had captured most of the [[Danish Navy]] at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]], in response to fears that it might fall into Napoleon's hands, but precipitating [[Gunboat War|war with the Danes]]. Captain Hamilton left the ship, and was superseded by Captain [[Edward Sneyd Clay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin44&quot;/&gt; ''Temeraire'' now became the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Manley Dixon|Sir Manley Dixon]], with orders to go to the Baltic to reinforce the fleet stationed there under [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Sir James Saumarez]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis213&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Temeraire'' arrived in May 1809 and was sent to blockade [[Karlskrona]] on the Swedish coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis213&quot;/&gt;

While on patrol with the 64-gun {{HMS|Ardent|1796|6}} and the frigate {{HMS|Melpomene|1794|6}}, ''Temeraire'' became involved in one of the heaviest Danish gunboat attacks of the war.  A party of men from ''Ardent'' had been landed on the island of [[Romsø]], but were taken by surprise in a Danish night attack, which saw most of the ''Ardent'' men captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis214&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Melpomene'' was sent under a flag of truce to negotiate for their release, but on returning from this mission, was becalmed. A flotilla of thirty Danish gunboats then launched an attack, taking advantage of the stranded ''Melpomene''{{'}}s inability to bring her broadside to bear on them. ''Melpomene'' signalled for help to the ''Temeraire'', which immediately dispatched boats to her assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodman133&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodman|title=The Victory of Seapower|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engaged and then drove off the Danish ships, and then helped the ''Melpomene'' to safety. She had been heavily damaged and suffered casualties of five killed and twenty-nine wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis215&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Temeraire''{{'}}s later Baltic service involved being dispatched to observe the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian fleet]] at [[Tallinn|Reval]], during which time she made a survey of the island of [[Naissaar|Nargen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis220&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; After important blockading and convoy escort work, ''Temeraire'' was ordered back to Britain as winter arrived, and she arrived in Plymouth in November 1809.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis220&quot;/&gt;

==Iberian service==
After a period under repair in Plymouth, ''Temeraire'' was recommissioned under the command of Captain Edwin H. Chamberlayne in late January 1810.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin44&quot;/&gt; The Peninsular War had reached a critical stage, with the Spanish government [[Siege of Cádiz|besieged in Cadiz]] by the French. ''Temeraire'', now the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Francis Pickmore]], was ordered to reinforce the city's water defences, and provided men from her sailor and marine complement to crew batteries and gunboats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis225&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men from ''Temeraire'' were heavily involved in the fighting until July 1810, when Pickmore was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean and take up a new position as [[Port Admiral (Royal Navy)|port admiral]] at [[Mahón]].  ''Temeraire'' was thereafter based either at Mahón or off Toulon with the blockading British fleet under Admiral [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Sir Edward Pellew]]. Chamberlayne was replaced by Captain [[Joseph Spear]] in March 1811, and for the most part the blockade was uneventful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin44&quot;/&gt; Though possessing a powerful fleet, the French commander avoided any contact with the blockading force and stayed in port, or else made very short voyages, returning to the harbour when the British appeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis229&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Temeraire''{{'}}s one brush with the French during this period came on 13 August 1811. Having received orders to sail to [[Minorca]], Spear attempted to tack out of Hyères Bay. As he tried to do so, the wind fell away, leaving ''Temeraire'' becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis229&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=The Ships of Trafalgar|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodman54&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodman|title=The Victory of Seapower|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, ''Temeraire'' was towed out of range of the French guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis229&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt; She then sailed to Minorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of [[yellow fever]] broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis233&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pellew ordered her back to Britain, and health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt;

==Retirement==
''Temeraire'' arrived in Plymouth on 9 February 1812 and was docked for a survey several weeks later. The survey reported that she was &quot;A well built and strong ship but apparently much decay'd&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt; Spear was superseded on 4 March by Captain [[Samuel Hood Linzee]], but Linzee's command was short-lived. ''Temeraire'' left the dock on 13 March and was paid off one week later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt; Advances in naval technology had developed more powerful and strongly built warships, and though still comparatively new, ''Temeraire'' was no longer considered desirable for front-line service. While laid up the decision was taken to convert her into a [[prison ship]] to alleviate overcrowding caused by large influxes of French prisoners from the Peninsular War campaigns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis236&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversion work was carried out at Plymouth between November and December 1813, after which she was laid up in the [[River Tamar]] as a prison hulk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt; From 1814 she was under the nominal command of Lieutenant John Wharton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt;  Despite being laid up and disarmed ''Temeraire'' and the rest of her class were nominally re-rated as 104-gun [[first rate]]s in February 1817.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield25&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships in the Age of Sail 1793–1817|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Temeraire''{{'}}s service as a prison ship lasted until 1819, at which point she was selected for conversion to a [[receiving ship]]. She was extensively refitted at Plymouth between September 1819 and June 1820 at a cost of £27,733, and then sailed to [[Sheerness Dockyard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt; As a receiving ship she served as a temporary berth for new naval recruits until they received a posting to a ship. She fulfilled this role for eight years, until becoming a victualling depot in 1829.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis251&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her final role was as a [[guard ship]] at Sheerness, under the title &quot;Guardship of the Ordinary and Captain-Superintendent's ship of the Fleet Reserve in the Medway&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis255&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; This final post as flagship of the Medway Reserve involved her being repainted and rearmed, and she was used to train boys belonging to [[The Marine Society]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis255&quot;/&gt; For the last two years of her service, from 1836 to 1838 she was under the nominal command of Captain Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, in his post as Captain-Superintendent of Sheerness. Kennedy had been ''Temeraire''{{'}}s first-lieutenant at Trafalgar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis256&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sale and disposal==
Kennedy received orders from the Admiralty in June 1838 to have ''Temeraire'' valued in preparation for her sale out of the service. She fired her guns for the last time on 28 June in celebration of the [[Coronation of Queen Victoria]], and work began on dismantling her on 4 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt; Kennedy delegated this task to Captain [[John Hill (Royal Navy officer)|Sir John Hill]], commander of {{HMS|Ocean|1805|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt; Her masts, stores and guns were all removed and her crew paid off, before ''Temeraire'' was put up for sale with twelve other ships. She was sold by [[Dutch auction]] on 16 August 1838 to John Beatson, a shipbreaker based at [[Rotherhithe]] for £5,530.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis257&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatson was then faced with the task of transporting the ship 55 miles from Sheerness to Rotherhithe, the largest ship to have attempted this voyage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis257&quot;/&gt; To accomplish this he hired two [[tugboat|steam tugs]] from the Thames Steam Towing Company and employed a Rotherhithe [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] named William Scott and twenty five men to sail her up the Thames, at a cost of £58.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt;{{Ref_label|F|f|none}}

==Last voyage==
[[File:Temeraire at Rotherhithe.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Print of the hull of a sailing ship without masts or rigging aground on mud beside a river.|''Temeraire'' laid up at Beatson's Yard, Rotherhithe, by artist J. J. Williams, 1838–39]]
The tugs took the [[Hulk (ship)|hulk]] of the ''Temeraire'' in tow at 7:30 am on 5 September, taking advantage of the beginning of the [[slack water]]. They had reached [[Greenhithe]] by 1:30 pm at the [[wikt:Ebb tide|ebb of the tide]], where they anchored overnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt; They resumed the journey at 8:30 am the following day, passing [[Woolwich]] and then [[Greenwich]] at noon. They reached [[Limehouse]] Reach shortly afterwards and brought her safely to Beatson's Wharf at 2 pm. The ''Temeraire'' was hauled up onto the mud, where she lay as she was slowly broken up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt; The final voyage was announced in a number of papers, and thousands of spectators came to see her towed up the Thames or laid up at Beatson's yard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis263&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, rudder [[pintle]]s and [[gudgeon]]s, copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
The immediate legacy of the ''Temeraire'' was the use of the timber taken from her as she was broken up. A gong stand made from ''Temeraire'' timber was a wedding present to the future King [[George V]] on the occasion of his marriage to [[Mary of Teck]], and is held at [[Balmoral Castle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin46&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=The Ships of Trafalgar|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis280&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[barometer]], [[gavel]], and some miscellaneous timber are in the collections of the [[National Maritime Museum]], and chairs made from ''Temeraire'' oak are in the possession of the [[Royal Naval Museum]], Portsmouth, [[Lloyd's Register]], London and the Whanganui Regional Museum, [[Whanganui]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis280&quot;/&gt; An [[altar]], [[Altar rails|communion rail]] and two [[Cathedra|bishop's chairs]] survive in [[St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe]].

M. W. Turner]], 1838. Turner's depiction of the final voyage of the ''Temeraire'' was voted Britain's favourite painting in 2005.]]
''Temeraire'' features in a number of paintings and prints, the earliest commemorating her role in the battle of Trafalgar. She can be seen at least partially in paintings of the battle by [[Clarkson Frederick Stanfield]], [[John Christian Schetky]], [[Nicholas Pocock]], [[Thomas Buttersworth]] and [[Thomas Whitcombe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis262&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fictionalised depiction of her launch was produced by Philip Burgoyne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis108&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later representations of the retired ''Temeraire'' were also popular. Though no known contemporary image of her in the prison ship role exists, she was painted while a guardship on the Medway in 1833 by [[Edward William Cooke]], and by William Beatson and J. J. Williams while laid up at Rotherhithe in 1838.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis269-70&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|pages=269–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently she has been the subject of paintings by [[Geoff Hunt (marine artist)|Geoff Hunt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt|title=The Marine Art of Geoff Hunt|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous painting of ''Temeraire'' was made by J. M. W. Turner and titled ''[[The Fighting Temeraire|The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up, 1838]]''. Turner depicts the ''Temeraire'' on her last voyage, towed up the Thames by a small black steam tug as the sun sets (or dawns). In choosing his title Turner created an enduring appellation, as previously she had been known to her crew as the &quot;saucy&quot; ''Temeraire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis266&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkins147&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=Trafalgar|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner presented it for exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1839 with an accompanying excerpt, slightly altered, of [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell's]] poem ''Ye Mariners of England''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkin310&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The flag which braved the battle and the breeze,&lt;br&gt;no longer owns her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis274&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Turner's painting achieved widespread critical acclaim, and accolades from the likes of John Ruskin and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis266&quot;/&gt; It was Turner's particular favourite; he only lent it once and refused to ever do so again. He also refused to sell it at any price, and on his death bequeathed it to the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis267&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hangs today in the [[National Gallery]], and in 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organized by [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|''Today'' programme]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis268&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
[[The Fighting Temeraire]] is a [[historical narrative]] written by [[Sam Willis]] and details &quot;extraordinary story of the mighty Temeraire, the ship behind J. M. W. Turner's iconic painting.&quot; It includes a detailed history of the ship, history of both the [[Seven Years’ War]] (1756–63) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1798–1815), and 50 full-color illustrations and 60 black-and-white photographs. 

[[Temeraire (series)]] is a [[historical fantasy]]/[[alternate history]] written by [[Naomi Novik]] and while does not include the ship itself, the namesake of the main character is Temeraire. Taking place in a alternate version of [[Napoleonic Wars]], where most history lines up with actual events, with the notable exception that countries each had an air force-not one of planes but instead made up of sentinel dragons. The ship itself is only featured in the 9th book.

===Poetry and songs===
The ''Temeraire'' became the subject of a number of poems and songs commemorating her life and fate. An early work by James Duff written between 1813 and 1819 referenced her role as a prison ship, and was set to music in 1857 under the title ''The Brave Old Temeraire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis263&quot;/&gt; More generally, an anonymous poem entitled ''The Wooden Walls of Old England'' appeared in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' shortly after ''Temeraire''{{'}}s arrival at Rotherhithe, and lamented the fate of the great sailing warships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis263&quot;/&gt; Turner's painting created an enduring interest in the story of the ''Temeraire'' and several poems appeared in the decades following her breaking up. [[Gerald Massey]] wrote ''The Fighting Temeraire Tugged to Her Last Berth'', [[Herman Melville]] produced ''The Temeraire'', and [[Henry Newbolt]] wrote ''The Fighting Temeraire'', with its closing lines &lt;blockquote&gt;Now the sunset's breezes shiver,&lt;br&gt;And she's fading down the river,&lt;br&gt;But in England's song forever,&lt;br&gt;She's the Fighting Temeraire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis316&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin|30em}}
'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}} Sometimes referred to as the ''Dreadnought'' class.

'''b.''' {{Note_label|B|b|none}} This ''Temeraire'' retained her French name after her capture, and served during the [[Seven Years' War]], before being sold out of the service in 1784.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin41&quot;/&gt;

'''c.''' {{Note_label|C|c|none}} A number of general histories, including Goodwin's ''The Ships of Trafalgar'' and Noel Mostert's ''The Line on the Wind'', state that all 14 were hanged.&lt;ref name=&quot;LUW&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mostert|title=The Line Upon A Wind|pages=420–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willis studied contemporary records and reports of the court-martial for his ''The Fighting Temeraire'', and states only 12 of the 14 were sentenced to be hanged. [[Roy and Lesley Adkins]] offer a third account, that twenty mutineers were tried, all were found guilty and eighteen were sentenced to death, the other two were to receive one hundred and twenty lashes each.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkins228&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkins &amp; Adkins|title=Jack Tar|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; They note that at least six were hanged and possibly as many as twelve, the remainder may have had their sentences commuted to [[Penal transportation|transportation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkins228&quot;/&gt;

'''d.''' {{Note_label|D|d|none}} Lucas described the scene on ''Redoutable'': &lt;blockquote&gt;In less than half an hour our ship had been so fearfully mauled that she looked like little more than a heap of debris. Judging by appearances, no doubt, the ''Temeraire'', now hailed us to surrender and not prolong a useless resistance. My reply was instantly to order some soldiers who were near me to fire back; which they did with great alacrity. At the same moment almost, the main mast of the ''Redoutable'' fell on board the English ship. The two topmasts of the ''Temeraire'' then came down, falling on board of us. Our whole poop was stove in, helm rudder and stern post all shattered to splinters, all the stern frame, and the decks shot through. All our own guns were either smashed or dismounted by the broadsides of the ''Victory'' and the ''Temeraire''...&amp;nbsp;The hull itself was riddled, shot through from side to side; deck beams were shattered, port lids torn away or knocked to pieces. Four of our six pumps were so damaged as to be useless. The quarter-deck ladders were broken, which rendered communication with the rest of the ship very difficult. Everywhere the decks were strewn with dead men, lying beneath the debris. Out of a crew of 634 men we had 522 ''hors de combat''; of whom 300 were killed and 222 wounded nearly all the officers among them&amp;nbsp;... The batteries and upper decks were practically abandoned – bare of men and were unable longer to offer any resistance. No one who had not seen the state of ''Redoutable'' could ever form an idea of her awful condition. Really I know of nothing on board that had not been hit by shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warwick211-2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Warwick |title=Voices from the Battle of Trafalgar|pages=211–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''e.''' {{Note_label|E|e|none}} The fall of the mainmast onto ''Temeraire'' also caused three French ''[[obusier]]s'' to fall onto her decks. Harvey promptly claimed them as souvenirs, &quot;with which&amp;nbsp;... to commemorate the event every year in May by firing them off from the mound at Chigwell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eliab Harvey (6 December 1805). Letter to W. Lloyd. Essex Record Office: D/DGu/C8. as cited in Willis. ''The Fighting Temeraire''. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''f.''' {{Note_label|F|f|none}} The identity of these tugs has been difficult to determine. Winfield names only one tug, ''Monarch''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield26&quot;/&gt; Goodwin names them as ''London'' and ''Samson'', while Willis states they were ''Sampson'' and ''Newcastle''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin45&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis257&quot;/&gt;
