[[SS]]-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]''[[#Promotions, demotions and decorations|**]] '''Bruno Gesche''' (5 November 1905 – 1980)&lt;ref&gt;* Rochus Misch: ''Der letzte Zeuge. Ich war Hitlers Telefonist, Kurier und Leibwächter''. With forward by [[Ralph Giordano (writer)|Ralph Giordano]], Piper München Zürich 2008, ISBN 978-3-492-25735-0&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[lieutenant colonel]] of the [[SS]] in [[Nazi Germany]]. He was a member of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s entourage and the fourth commander of Hitler 's personal bodyguard (originally known as the ''[[SS-Begleitkommando des Führers]]'', later known as ''Führerbegleitkommando'') for the periods June 1934 – April 1942 and December 1942 – December 1944.

==Early career==
Gesche's aspirations for a career in the German military as an officer were effectively ended by the limitations imposed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on the post-First World War [[defense (military)|national defence]] force, the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' and his limited education.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=52}} Gesche joined what was then a fringe political movement, the [[NSDAP]] (Nazi Party), and its paramilitary wing, the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) in 1922. Although Gesche's association with the [[Nazi]] movement cost him his job at a bank in 1923.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=52}} His status within the Nazi Party as an ''[[Alte Kämpfer]]'' (NSDAP Member No. 8592) proved to be a tremendous asset to him during the better part of the subsequent two and a half decades.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=48, 49, 52-54}} In 1927 Gesche left the SA to join what was then its subordinate outfit, the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS Member No. 1093).{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=52}} The SS, as in its earlier incarnations, the ''[[Stabswache]]'' and ''[[Stoßtrupp-Hitler]]'', functioned as the future [[Führer]]'s bodyguard.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=14, 16}}{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=26–29}}

==''SS-Begleitkommando des Führers''==
On 29 February 1932, with the advice of ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], Hitler chose eight from a prospective twelve SS men presented by [[Sepp Dietrich]], to serve as his personal bodyguard, the ''[[SS-Begleitkommando des Führers]]''.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=48}} One of the handpicked men was Bruno Gesche.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=48}} Not long after the unit's creation, Gesche managed to draw the ire of Himmler{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=52}} To Himmler's consternation, Hitler's fondness for Gesche stemming from their days as old guard comrades would define Gesche's fate for practically the duration of the [[Third Reich]]'s existence.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=52, 53}}

===Conflicts with Himmler===
The first incident between Gesche and Himmler arose as a result of criticism that the former levied against the security detail provided by another SS unit during a Hitler campaign speech in [[Selb]] on 14 October 1932.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=52}} Himmler regarded this as a personal affront. Both Himmler and the SS Group Commander South demanded that Gesche be demoted and removed from the ''SS-Begleitkommando'', however, Hitler ordered that Gesche receive only a reprimand.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=52, 53}}{{sfn|Felton|2014|p=33}}

Himmler did succeed in having Gesche's immediate superior, the third commander of the ''SS-Begleitkommando'', [[Kurt Gildisch]] dismissed in 1934.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=52}} Eventually Gildisch was dismissed from the SS, as well as the Nazi Party in 1936, for repeated instances of drunkenness. Gesche as second-in-command succeeded Gildisch as commander of the ''SS-Begleitkommando'' in June 1934.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=52}} The unit was later expanded and became known as the ''Führerbegleitkommando'' (Führer Escort Command; FBK).{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|pp=16, 287}}

On another occasion in 1935, Himmler as part of his attempts at consolidating his authority ordered that salaries of Hitler's personal bodyguard detail be suspended. Gesche responded by enlisting the help of the commander of Hitler's personal bodyguard regiment, [[Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]], [[Sepp Dietrich]], who was able to have Himmler's order reversed.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=53}}

Seizing on Gesche's frequent bouts of intoxication, Himmler enforced an SS requirement that had been established in 1937, forbidding SS men from consuming alcohol in excess of certain mandated limits.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=53}} After obtaining evidence that Gesche was in violation of the mandate, Himmler had him sign a statement on 26 September 1938, promising to abstain from alcohol consumption for three years or else face expulsion from the SS. After a few months Himmler lifted the ban.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=53}} Hitler's fondness for Gesche had again forced Himmler's hand.{{sfn|Felton|2014|p=34}}

===War years===
In early 1942, after another session of heavy-drinking, Gesche pulled his pistol and threatened a fellow SS officer.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=53}} After Himmler was informed of the events, even Gesche's close relationship with Hitler could not save him from the wrath of the ''Reichsführer-SS''.  Gesche was dismissed from his command of the ''Führerbegleitkommando'' and again required to abstain from drinking for three years.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=53}} Gesche was transferred to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and the [[Waffen-SS]], [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|5th SS Panzer Division ''Wiking'']].{{sfn|Felton|2014|p=96}} He served with 1./SS-Panzer-Jäger-Abteilung 5. The 5th SS, from the moment Gesche arrived in the summer of 1942, engaged in bitter battles with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces for control of the oil-rich [[Caucasus]]. Before the collapse of the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 6th Army]] at [[Stalingrad]], and the retreat through the Caucasus by the remnants that had not surrendered Gesche had been evacuated from the front after being wounded in combat.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=53}} Hitler was pleased with Gesche's performance, and by December 1942, he returned to command the ''Führerbegleitkommando''.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=53}} Hitler decreed that no man who had served in Hitler's HQ should be sent to the Eastern Front, for fear of capture and interrogation by the Soviets as to security information.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=53}}{{sfn|Felton|2014|p=97}}

In December 1944 Gesche's time as commander of the ''Führerbegleitkommando'' came to an end.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=54}} In his strongly worded rebuke, soon after an incident that featured a drunken Gesche firing shots at a comrade, Himmler wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style= &quot;font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#EEEEEE;&quot;&gt; — &lt;/span&gt; You are known to me as a notorious drunk from the year 1938, as well as from reports in recent years and months. Since I cannot tolerate drunks in the Führerkorps, I demote you. Only based on your long association will I allow you to remain in the SS. I will give you the opportunity to serve in the [[Dirlewanger Brigade]] and by proving yourself before the enemy, it might be possible to wipe out the shame you have brought on yourself and the entire SS. I expect you to abstain from alcohol for the rest of your life, without any exceptions. Should your will power be already damaged by alcohol to the extent that you cannot keep this pledge, then I expect you to hand in your resignation.{{sfn|How Hitler's Bodyguard Worked 2015}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gesche was reduced by nine grades, from a SS-''Obersturmbannführer'' to SS-''Unterscharführer'' and [[Franz Schädle]] was promoted to be the next commander of the FBK.{{sfn|Felton|2014|p=158}}{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|pp=293, 294}} Gesche's assignment to the notorious SS penal unit, Dirlewanger, at that stage of the war, was for all practical purposes a death sentence.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=54}} Although Hitler did not personally intervene on Gesche's behalf, other allies in the SS did.  SS-''[[Gruppenführer]]'' [[Hermann Fegelein]] and SS-''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[Maximilian von Herff]] successfully argued that assignment to the Dirlewanger Brigade which was then operating on the Eastern Front, would be in contravention to the Hitler order forbidding such deployments.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=54}} Although Gesche was spared certain death with the Dirlewanger unit, he never again rejoined the ''Führerbegleitkommando''. He was instead assigned to the [[16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS]], 5./SS-Panzer-Grenadier-Regiment 35, ultimately surrendering to the Americans in Italy in 1945.{{sfn|Felton|2014|p=159}} According to records housed at the [[Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt)]], Bruno Gesche's last date of internment by the [[Western Allies]] was 22 March 1947.
