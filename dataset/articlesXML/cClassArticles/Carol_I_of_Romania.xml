'''Carol I''' (20 April 1839 – 27 September ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) / 10 October ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]) 1914), born '''Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen''', was the ruler of [[Romania]] from 1866 to 1914. He was elected [[prince|Ruling Prince]] ([[Domnitor]]) of the [[United Principalities|Romanian United Principalities]] on 20 April 1866 after the overthrow of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] by a palace coup d'état. In May 1877, he proclaimed Romania an independent and sovereign nation.  The defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1878) in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] secured Romanian independence. He was proclaimed  [[King of Romania]] on {{OldStyleDate|26 March|1881|14 March}}. He was the first ruler of the [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] dynasty, which ruled the country until the proclamation of a republic in 1947.

During his reign, Carol I personally led Romanian troops during the Russo-Turkish War and assumed command of the Russo/Romanian army during the [[siege of Plevna]]. The country achieved internationally recognized independence via the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878]] and acquired [[Southern Dobruja]] from [[Bulgaria]] in 1913. Domestic political life, still dominated by the country's wealthy landowning families organized around the rival [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|Liberal]] and [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative]] parties, was punctuated by two widespread peasant uprisings, in [[Wallachia]] (the southern half of the country) in April 1888 and in [[Moldavia]] (the northern half) in March 1907.

He married Princess [[Elisabeth of Wied]] in [[Neuwied]] on 15 November 1869. They only had one daughter, [[Princess Maria of Romania (1870–1874)|Maria]], who died at the age of three.

Carol never produced a male heir, leaving his elder brother [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern|Leopold]] next in line to the throne. In October 1880 Leopold renounced his right of succession in favour of his son [[William, Prince of Hohenzollern|William]], who in turn surrendered his claim six years later in favour of his younger brother, the future king [[Ferdinand of Romania|Ferdinand]].

==Early life==
[[File:Prinz Karl im sechsten Lebensalter 1845.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Prince Karl of Hohenzollern Sigmaringen, aged 6]]
[[File:Prince Karl of Hohenzollern Sigmaringen.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Prince Karl of Hohenzollern Sigmaringen]]

Prince Karl Eitel Friedrich Zephyrinus Ludwig of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was born in [[Sigmaringen]], the second son of [[Karl Anton, Prince of Hohenzollern|Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] and his wife, [[Princess Josephine of Baden]]. After finishing his elementary studies, Karl entered the Cadet School in [[Münster]]. In 1857 he was attending the courses of the Artillery School in [[Berlin]]. Up to 1866, when he accepted the crown of Romania, he was a Prussian officer. He took part in the [[Second Schleswig War]], including the assault of the [[Fredericia]] citadel and [[Dybbøl]], an experience which would be very useful to him later in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]].

Although he was quite frail and not very tall, prince Karl was reported to be the perfect soldier, healthy and disciplined, and also a very good politician with liberal ideas. He was familiar with several European languages. His family was closely related to the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte family]] (one of his grandmothers was a [[Stéphanie de Beauharnais|Beauharnais]], Joséphine's niece-in-law, and the other a Murat, [[Joachim Murat|Joachim]]'s niece [[Marie Antoinette Murat]]), they enjoyed very good relations with [[Napoleon III of France]]. 
==On the way to Romania==
[[File:Stamp 1933 Turnu Severin 1 leu.jpg||left|thumb|On {{OldStyleDate|May 20|1866|May 8}}, Karl entered [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin]]]]
The former Domnitor of united Romania, [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], had been expelled from the country by the leading noblemen and Romania was in a political chaos. Cuza's double election, both in [[Wallachia]] and in [[Moldavia]]) had been the basis on which the Romanian Principalities' unification was recognized by the European powers. With him gone, the country was in danger of disintegration.

As Romanian politicians searched for a successor, Napoleon suggested Karl.  Napoleon's recommendation weighed heavily with Romanian politicians of the time, since Romania was strongly influenced by French culture.  Another factor was Karl's blood relation to the ruling Prussian family. [[Ion Brătianu]] was the Romanian politician who was sent to negotiate with Karl and his family the possibility of installing him on the Romanian throne. 

Due to the political conflict between [[Prussia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]], Karl travelled incognito by railroad from [[Düsseldorf]] to [[Baziaș]], through Switzerland. He received there a Swiss passport from a Swiss public clerk, friend of his family, under the name of Karl Hettingen. From Baziaș he travelled by boat to [[Turnu Severin]], as there was no railroad to Romania. As he crossed the border onto Romanian soil, he was met by Brătianu, who bowed before him and asked Karl to join him in his carriage.  He was elected Domnitor on 20 April.

On 10 May 1866 (22 May 1866 [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]), Karl entered [[Bucharest]]. The news of his arrival had been transmitted by telegraph and he was welcomed by a huge crowd eager to see the new ruler. In [[Băneasa]] he was given the keys to the capital city. Eventually it was a rainy day after a long period of drought, apparently a very favorable sign. As he was crowned, Karl swore this oath: &quot;I swear to guard the laws of Romania, to maintain the rights of its People and the integrity of its territory.&quot; He spoke in [[French language|French]], as he did not speak Romanian. However, he endeared himself to his adopted country by adopting the Romanian spelling of his name, Carol.

==The Constitution==
[[Image:Carol I, Elisabeta and Maria.jpg|thumb|right|''Domnitor'' Carol with his wife and their only daughter (1873)]]
Immediately after arriving in the country, the Romanian parliament adopted, on 29 June 1866, the [[1866 Constitution of Romania]], one of the most advanced constitutions in that time. This constitution allowed the development and modernization of the Romanian state. In a daring move, the Constitution chose to ignore the nominal suzerainty of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which paved the way towards ''de jure'' independence.

Article 82 stated that &quot;The ruler's powers are hereditary, starting directly from His Majesty, prince Carol I of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, on the male line through the right of first-born, with the exclusion of women and their issue. His Majesty's descendants will be raised in the Eastern Orthodox Religion.&quot;  It, like all but one of its successors, enshrined the principle that the king reigned, but did not rule.

In 1877, Romania was proclaimed independent, ending the fiction of Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1866. From 1878, Carol held the title of Royal Highness (''Alteță Regală''). On 15 March 1881, the constitution was amended to proclaim Romania a kingdom. Carol became the first king, while the heir-apparent or heir-presumptive would be called Prince Royal. On 10 May, Carol was [[Steel Crown of Romania|crowned]] king.

==King of Romania==
King Carol was reported to be a cold person. He was permanently concerned with the prestige of the dynasty he had founded. His wife, Elizabeth, claimed he 'wore the crown in his sleep'. He was very meticulous and he tried to impose his style upon everyone that surrounded him. Though he was devoted to his job as Romania's ruler, he never forgot his German roots.

In 48 years of rule—the longest in Romanian history—he helped Romania gain its independence, raised its prestige, helped redress its economy and established a dynasty. In the Carpathian mountains, he built [[Peleș Castle]], still one of Romania's most visited touristic attractions. The castle was built in German style, as a reminder of the king's origin. After the Russo-Turkish war, Romania gained [[Northern Dobruja]] and Carol ordered the first [[King Carol I Bridge|bridge]] over the [[Danube]], between [[Fetești]] and [[Cernavodă]], linking the newly acquired province to the rest of the country.

As a member of the German higher landed aristocracy (''Fürst''), Carol never managed to follow the much-needed liberal and poor-friendly policies initiated by his predecessor, Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Left unsolved, the grave social problems caused by the inequity of land ownership, ignited peasant uprisings throughout the reign of Carol I. The peasant class was suppressed during [[1907 Romanian Peasants' revolt|1907 revolt]], at the cost of 10,000 lives.{{efn|group=lower-alpha|&quot;The issue burst to the forefront of national affairs once again in 1907 when Carol suppressed a peasant rebellion at the cost of 10,000 lives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Carol I.&quot;, World History: The Modern Era, ABC-CLIO, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}} {{efn|group=lower-alpha|&quot;Romanian peasants revolt in Moldavia beginning in March to protest their inability to buy land; they also protest their exploitation by the crown and by grain merchants such as Leopold Louis-Dreyfus. Some 10,000 die before Carol I can regain control of the country in April.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author-last=Trager|author-first=James|chapter=&quot;1907&quot;|title=The People's Chronology|edition=3|location=Detroit|publisher=Gale|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dTAQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Trager+%22The+People%27s+Chronology%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t5MSU6yVEc78oATb8YLYDA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA|isbn=9780805031348}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Being under the influence of local landlords, the king failed to put together a sound administration, as envisioned by Prince Cuza.{{efn|group=lower-alpha|&quot;A part of the Ottoman Empire from the fifteenth century, the independence of Moldavia and Wallachia as Romania was recognized at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. The new state was relatively weak, its administration corrupt and inefficient, and the power of the landlords remained intact. This led to a number of peasants' revolts (1888, 1907), which were brutally suppressed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=&quot;Romania&quot;|title=A Dictionary of Contemporary World History|author-first=Jan|author-last=Palmowski|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} {{efn|group=lower-alpha|&quot;Economic and formal political progress, however, was not matched by similar advancement of democratic processes in the social field. The liberal provisions of the 1866 Constitution were circumvented under the authoritarian governmental system, leaving much actual power in the hands of the landed aristocracy. The slowly rising middle class and small number of industrial entrepreneurs were granted some rights, but the increasing number of industrial workers and the great peasant majority shared very little in the political life of the country. A major [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|peasant revolt in 1907]] attempted unsuccessfully to rectify the serious social imbalance. The uprising was forcefully suppressed with extensive loss of life and, although some corrective measures were later instituted that improved working conditions and resulted in the division of more large landholdings, the general political strength and living standards of the peasants and workers were not materially improved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Romania: Chapter 2A, Historical Setting|author-first=Eugene K.|author-last=Keefe|title=Countries of the World|date=1991-01-01|location=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The end of the reign==
The long rule of Carol helped the quick development of the Romanian state. But, towards the end of his reign and the start of the [[World War I]], Carol wanted to enter the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]]. However, Romanian public opinion was overwhelmingly Francophile and sided with the [[Triple Entente]]. Carol had signed a secret treaty in 1883 which had linked Romania with the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. Although the treaty was to be activated only if Russia attacked one of the signatories, Carol was convinced that the honourable thing to do was to enter the war supporting the [[German Empire]] and his cousin, [[William II, German Emperor|Emperor William II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwcWDFZWuJgC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=Carol+romania+war+secret&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rH4SU9CGCZD-oQSXg4DYBQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Carol%20romania%20war%20secret&amp;f=false |title=Brief Romanian Military History |author-first=Călin |author-last=Hentea |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |page=102 |isbn=9780810858206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjZHLXRKjtEC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=Carol+romania+war+secret&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rH4SU9CGCZD-oQSXg4DYBQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Carol%20romania%20war%20secret&amp;f=false |title=A Companion to World War I |author-first=Jean-Jacques|author-last=Becker |chapter=Chapter Fourteen: War Aims and Neutrality |editor-first=John |editor-last=Horne |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |page=208 |isbn=9781405123860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{OldStyleDate|3 August|1914|21 July}}, an emergency meeting was held with the Crown Council, where Carol told them about the secret treaty and shared his opinion with them. However, most of the Crown Council members strongly disagreed, opting for neutrality. King Carol died in {{OldStyleDate|10 October|1914|27 September}}. The new king, Ferdinand (under the influence of his wife, [[Marie of Edinburgh]], a British princess), was more willing to listen to public opinion.

==Life and family==
[[Image:King Carol I of Romania with his nephew and great nephew.jpg|left|thumb|King Carol I of Romania with his nephew ([[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]]) and grand-nephew ([[Carol II of Romania|Carol]])]]
When he was elected prince of Romania, Carol was unmarried. In 1869, the prince started a trip around Europe and mainly Germany, to find a bride. During this trip he met and married Princess [[Elizabeth of Wied]] at [[Neuwied]] on 15 November 1869. Their marriage was one of the most unfit matches in history, with Carol being a cold and calculating man while Elizabeth was a notorious dreamer. They had one child, [[Princess Maria of Romania (1870–1874)|Princess Maria]], born in 1871, who died 24 March 1874. She had no prospect of inheriting her father's throne; as mentioned above, the Constitution limited succession to the male line. This led to the further estrangement of the royal couple, Elizabeth never completely recovering from the trauma of losing her only child.

After the proclamation of the Kingdom (1881), the succession was a very important matter of state. Since Carol's brother, [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern|Leopold]] (in 1880), and his oldest son, [[William, Prince of Hohenzollern|William]] (in 1886), declined their rights, the second son of Leopold, [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]], was named prince of Romania and [[heir-presumptive]] to the throne, in 1886.

Towards the end of Carol's life, though, Carol and Elizabeth finally found a way to understand each other and were reported to have become good friends.
