'''HMAS ''Burnie'' (J198/B238/A112)''', named for the port city of [[Burnie, Tasmania]], was one of 60 [[Bathurst-class corvette|''Bathurst''-class corvettes]] constructed during [[World War II]] and one of 20 built for the [[Admiralty]] but manned by personnel of and commissioned into the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN).&lt;ref name=SPC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-burnie-i |title=HMAS ''Burnie'' (I) |accessdate=10 December 2013 |work=The Fleet — Ships, Boats &amp; Craft |publisher=Royal Australian Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering RAN service in April 1941, ''Burnie'' saw action during World War II, and was decommissioned on 5 July 1946. The corvette was sold to the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] (RNN) five days later, was renamed '''HNLMS ''Ceram''''', and remained in service until 1958.

==Design and construction==
{{main|Bathurst-class corvette}}
In 1938, the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board]] (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.&lt;ref name=Hindsight1&gt;Stevens, ''The Australian Corvettes'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StevensACV103&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel was initially envisaged as having a [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least {{convert|10|kn}}, and a range of {{convert|2000|nmi}}&lt;ref name=StevensACV103.4&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt; The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled [[Bar-class boom defence vessel]] saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a {{convert|15.5|kn}} top speed, and a range of {{convert|2850|nmi}}, armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with [[asdic]], and able to fitted with either [[depth charge]]s or [[Naval mine#Mine sweeping|minesweeping]] equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.&lt;ref name=Hindsight1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', pp. 103–5&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the prototype {{HMAS|Kangaroo||6}} did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.&lt;ref name=StevensACV104&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including ''Burnie'') ordered by the [[British Admiralty]] but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the [[Royal Indian Navy]].&lt;ref name=Hindsight1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', pp. 105, 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Donohue29&gt;Donohue, ''From Empire Defence to the Long Haul'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevens108&gt;Stevens et al., ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt;

''Burnie'' was laid down by [[Mort's Dock and Engineering Company]] in [[Balmain, New South Wales]] on 4 June 1940.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; The corvette was launched on 25 October 1940 by Lady King, wife of the Mort's Dock Chairman of Directors, and was commissioned into the RAN on 15 April 1941.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt;

==Operational history==

===Royal Australian Navy===

====Australia and Singapore====
''Burnie'' was initially assigned to the [[20th Minesweeping Flotilla]], which she joined on 10 May 1941.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; The ship was then temporarily based at [[Fremantle, Western Australia]] as a patrol ship and convoy escort, then was sent to Sydney. In June, ''Burnie'' and sister ship [[HMAS Goulburn|''Goulburn'']] were assigned to the Royal Navy's [[China Force]], and sailed to Singapore via the east coast of Australia, arriving on 12 July.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; There Burnie with {{HMAS|Goulburn||6}}, {{HMAS|Bendigo|J187|6}} and {{HMAS|Maryborough|J195|6}} composed the 21st Minesweeping Flotilla assigned to minesweeping, patrol and escort duties.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=509}} ''Burnie'' was present in Singapore when Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] and [[Japanese Invasion of Malaya|invaded Malaya]].&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt;

====Collapse of Java====
The corvette was involved in a series of actions delaying the Japanese advance through Malaya and the [[Netherlands East Indies]], including anti-submarine patrol, demolition work, troop and civilian evacuation, and anti-aircraft engagements, both individually and in concert with other Allied ships.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; During this time, she was involved in the evacuation of Sumatra in mid-February 1942, and, with ''Bendigo'', rescued survivors from the Dutch vessel {{SS|Boero|1914|2}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;Allied Merchant Ship Losses in the Pacific and Southeast Asia (December 7th, 1941 – March 9th, 1942): Confiscated former French 7,135 ton freighter ''Dupleix'' sunk 25 February in the Indian Ocean south of Sunda Strait by torpedo from IJN submarine I-58. Ship spelling sometimes ''Boeroe'', but ''Boero'' per Lloyd's and Gill.&lt;/ref&gt; on 28 February from the beach at [[Java Head]].{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=618}} During the final days the ship was flagship for Commodore [[John Augustine Collins|Collins]] commanding the China Force.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; This continued until September 1942, when ''Burnie'' was assigned to the [[British Eastern Fleet]] for anti-submarine patrol and convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt;

Along with ''Goulburn'' the ship had left Singapore on 25 January assigned to sweep the southern half of [[Banka Strait]] arriving in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] 30 January and on finding the harbor congested were at [[Tanjong Priok]] by 2 February where ''Burnie'' and ''Goulburn'' began on 5 February a continuous anti-submarine patrol until the Japanese invasion of Java.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=561, 566}} By 12 February and a flood of ships fleeing the fall of Singapore and Japanese advances the ship was sent to [[Bandar Lampung|Oosthaven]] in [[Sumatra]] for anti-submarine patrols at that port.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=570}} On the 17th the ship entered the port with {{HNLMS|Soemba}} to assist in demolition of facilities covering a bridge to the wharf with her gun while a shore party worked through the night destroying ammunition, rail equipment and placing depth charges under the KPM wharf and a cargo shed as well as pouring sulphuric acid into the working parts and destroying propellers of four trucks of torpedoes before ''Burnie'' got underway and completed destruction with gunfire.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=575—576}}

On the morning of 19 February the ship arrived at Tanjong Priok where her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander T. Christy, RANR(S), reported to Commodore Collins and received orders to take temporary command of {{HMAS|Ballarat|J184|6}} and, with a party of Royal Air Force personnel return in ''Ballarat'' to Oosthaven for salvage of air force material.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=577}} With that mission accomplished Christy returned in ''Ballarat'' on 21 February, the date when the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] had cabled [[Winston Churchill]] that further efforts to hold Java and the purpose of the command itself were useless.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=578}} Withdrawal from Java began and on 22 February ''Ballarat'', ''Bendigo'', ''Burnie'' and ''Maryborough'' replaced coal burning ships in the Sunda Strait Auxiliary Patrol established by Collins to prevent Japanese landings on Java from Sumatra with night crossings in small craft.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=578}}

By the 27th all British ships were ordered withdrawn from the Sunda Strait area and all the ships of 21st Minesweeping Flotilla were short of fuel with the flotilla commander ordering withdrawal to [[Tjilatjap]] for fueling on 28 February but ''Bendigo'' and ''Burnie'' were detached to rescue a party seen signaling from Java Head. On reaching the site ''Bendigo'' picked up fifteen and ''Burnie'' twenty-nine people that were survivors of the Dutch ship ''Boero'' that had been torpedoed several days earlier. Meanwhile, the flotilla had been ordered to return to Sunda Strait but the two ships with survivors were ordered on to Tjilatjap.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=578}}

On 1 March, with the two ships and survivors approaching Tjilatjap the withdrawal from Batavia was ordered and all British ships were to gather at Tjilatjap for evacuation. By the time the two corvettes arrived on the afternoon of 1 March Japanese forces were already south of the port and ''Bendigo'' broadcast a message from Commodore Collins that all ships with enough fuel to avoid that port should proceed directly to [[Fremantle]] or [[Colombo]]. During the evening Collins arrived from Batavia and boarded ''Burnie''. Evacuees were loaded on all ships available in the port and at 8 p.m. on 2 March ''Burnie'' departed flying Collins' flag and reaching Fremantle on 8 March after narrowly escaping [[Nobutake Kondō|Admiral Kondō's]] cruisers that sunk {{HMS|Stronghold|H50|6}}, the first of the British ships that left Tjilatjap, {{HMAS|Yarra|U77|6}}, {{USS|Pillsbury|DD-227|6}} and {{USS|Asheville|PG-21|6}}.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=626—632}}

====Eastern Fleet====
''Burnie'' remained with the Eastern Fleet until December 1944, when she and the other Admiralty-controlled Australian corvettes were ordered to Sydney, formed up as a Minesweeping Flotilla, and attached to the [[British Pacific Fleet]].&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; The corvette was primarily used as a patrol ship and convoy escort in the waters of New Guinea, the Admiralty Islands, and the Philippines.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt;

After World War II ended in August 1945, ''Burnie'' was ordered to Hong Kong, where she was involved in mine clearance operations.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; By November, she had returned to Australian waters, and during December 1945 and January 1946 was involved in several public relations activities, including a visit to her [[Burnie, Tasmania|namesake town]] and a cruise for children in Port Phillip Bay.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; The corvette's wartime service was recognised with three [[battle honour]]s: &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot;, &quot;Indian Ocean 1942–44&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.&lt;ref name=newhonours&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |title=Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613184920/http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |archivedate=13 June 2011 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=honourslist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |title=Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614064156/http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Netherlands Navy service===
Following the end of World War II, all of the Admiralty-operated ''Bathurst'' class corvettes were earmarked for disposal. ''Burnie'', along with sister ships [[HMAS Ipswich (J186)|''Ipswich'']] and [[HMAS Toowoomba (J157)|''Toowoomba'']], were slated for transfer to the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] (RNN).&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; The three corvettes departed Brisbane on 4 June 1946, arriving in Ceylon a month and a day later.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; The three ships were paid off from RAN service and commissioned into the RNN; ''Burnie'' being renamed HNLMS ''Ceram''

''Ceram'' remained in service with the RNN until 1958, when she was removed from the active service list.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt;
