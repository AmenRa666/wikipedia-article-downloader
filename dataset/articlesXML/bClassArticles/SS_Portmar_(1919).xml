'''''Portmar''''' was a United States-flagged merchant vessel that was constructed in response to World War I, operated by a succession of companies in the interwar period, then taken up for wartime shipping in World War II.

The ship was built to [[Design 1013 ship|Design 1013]], as part of wartime orders by the [[United States Shipping Board]] (USSB). She was laid down by [[Northwest Steel]] of [[Portland, Oregon]], with the name '''''West Minsi'''''. The USSB order was cancelled during construction, but Northwest Steel completed the ship for private sale. She was sold to the [[Green Star Line]] before launching in November 1919, and was assigned the name '''''Centaurus'''''. The freighter was sold to Nafra in 1920, then on to the [[Planet Steamship Company]] in 1923. In 1929, the ship was sold to the [[Calmar Steamship Company]], who renamed the ship ''Portmar''.

In late 1941, ''Portmar'' was chartered by the [[United States Department of War]] to carry supplies to the Philippines but due to the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|Japanese invasion of the Philippines]] was retained in Australia. She was used in February 1942 to carry reinforcements from Darwin for the [[Sparrow Force|defenders of Timor]] prior to the [[Battle of Timor|Japanese invasion]]. The reinforcement convoy was shadowed by Japanese planes and attacked, forcing its cancellation. ''Portmar'' returned to Darwin on 18 February, and was still in harbour the next day when Japanese carrier-based aircraft [[Bombing of Darwin|attacked the city]] in the first ever attack on Australia. The ship was heavily damaged, and run aground to prevent sinking.

''Portmar'' was later refloated, towed to Sydney, repaired, purchased by the United States Army and put back into service as an Army transport. In June 1943, she sailed as part of [[convoy GP55]]. On 15 June, off [[Smoky Cape]], ''Portmar'' and the landing ship [[USS LST-469|''LST-469'']] were torpedoed by the Japanese submarine [[Japanese submarine I-174|''I-174'']]. Due to a highly volatile cargo, ''Portmar'' was abandoned and sank in less than ten minutes. She was the last ship lost to the [[Axis naval activity in Australian waters|Japanese submarine campaign in Australian waters]].

== Design and construction ==
{{Main article|Design 1013 ship}}
The ship was built to [[Design 1013 ship|Design 1013]] or the &quot;''Robert Dollar'' type&quot;, a standardised freighter design ordered by the [[United States Shipping Board]] (USSB) from multiple west-coast shipyards during World War I.&lt;ref name=McKeller475a&gt;McKeller, ''Steel Shipbuilding under the U.

It had cylinders of {{convert|24.5|in|cm}}, {{convert|41.5|in|cm}} and {{convert|68|in|cm}} diameter by {{convert|48|in|cm}} stroke.

== Operational history ==
The first voyage of ''Centaurus'' departed from [[Astoria, Oregon]] in late December 1919, bound for [[Callao]], Peru.&lt;ref name=AstoriaBoyDies&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2676874/the_oregon_daily_journal/ |title=Astoria Boy Dies; Cruelty Charged |date=22 October 1920 |work=The Oregon Daily Journal |pages=8 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the voyage, one of the crewmen suffered a mental breakdown over concerns about his invalid passport.&lt;ref name=AstoriaBoyDies /&gt; Instead of providing medical assistance, the sailor was [[Leg irons|placed in irons]], removed from the crew list and relisted as a [[stowaway]], then abandoned on the dockside when ''Centaurus'' departed Callao on 17 January 1920.&lt;ref name=AstoriaBoyDies /&gt; The crewman ended up in an insane asylum, where he died later that year.&lt;ref name=AstoriaBoyDies /&gt;

* 18 January 1920. The newspaper &quot;[[The Sunday Oregonian]]&quot;, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], wrote on the page 46:
 &lt;big&gt;'''GREEN STAR WILL PLY ATLANTIC'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 '''Four Steamers Purchased Here to Sail From Baltimore.'''&lt;br/&gt;
 '''ORIENTAL RUN PROMISED'''&lt;br/&gt;
 '''Cruft Now Being Built at Standifer Plant Expected to Be Operated on Pacific.'''&lt;br/&gt;
 Speculation as to the future field of operations of the Green Star Steamship company, which purchased four steel steamers in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and placed orders for the construction of five more, was ended last week by a formal announcement from the headquarters of the company in [[Baltimore]], where the Green Star line has pur chased a large building to serve as a home for its shipping enterprises. The last of the steamers purchased by, the line here, the ''Circlnus'', sailed from [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]] Wednesday with a full cargo of lumber for [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]], Australia. This cargo amounted to 4.086,103 feet, it is reported by Brown &amp; McCabe, stevedores, who had charge of loading the vessel.&lt;br/&gt;
 The three other steamers purchased here by the Green Star line are the ''Corvus'', which went in ballast to [[Arica]], Chile, to load nitrates for [[Europe]]; the '''''Centaurus''''', which took a part cargo of lumber here and went to [[San Francisco]] to finish a general cargo for the west coast, and the ''Clauseus'', which went from here to San Francisco in ballast to load beans for [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=OP&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1920-01-18/ed-1/seq-46/ocr.txt   The Sunday &quot;OREGOXIAX, PORTLAND,&quot; JANUARY 18, 1920. &gt;&gt; GREEN STAR WILL PLYS ATLANTIC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1920-01-18/ed-1/seq-46/   Historic Oregan Nespaper &gt;&gt; The Sunday Oregonian.

* 13 of December 1929. The newspaper &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; in Oakland, California, wrote:

   The &quot;Calmar Line&quot; has purchased five freighters from the &quot;Planet Steamship company&quot;, according to announcement from New York. This purchase increases the Calmar intercoastal fleet to eleven ships. The new craft are 880 tons register.&lt;br/&gt;
   The vessels involved are all well known on this coast, consisting of the [[SS Circinus|''Circinius'']], ''Corvus'', ''Clauseus'', [[SS Centaurus|''Centaurus'']] and ''Eurana''.

''Centaurus'' was renamed ''Portmar'', and her port of registry was changed to [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name=Portmar30 /&gt;&lt;ref name=McKeller478 /&gt; In 1934, her Code Letters were changed to KOPZ.&lt;ref name=Portmar34&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=34b0677.pdf |title=Lloyd's Register, Navires a Vapeur et a Moteurs |author=Lloyd's of London |year=1934 |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July 1937, while on a voyage from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], ''Portmar'' collided with the ''Handkerchief Lightvessel'' in dense fog.

=== World War II ===
On 18 November 1941, ''Portmar'' and seven other ships ({{SS|Iowan||2}}, {{SS|Mauna Loa||2}}, {{SS|West Camargo|1920|2}}, ''{{SS|Steel Voyager||2}}'', {{SS|Jane Christenson|1918|2}}, {{SS|F. J.

''Portmar'' was still in Darwin Harbour the next day when a force of Japanese carrier-based aircraft [[Bombing of Darwin|attacked the city]]: the first time Australia had been attacked.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 590–1&lt;/ref&gt; She was heavily damaged during the attack, and was towed away from her mooring and run aground to prevent her from sinking.&lt;ref name=Grose111&gt;Grose, ''An Awkward Truth'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; One of the crew was killed, and several wounded were later recovered by the examination vessel {{HMAS|Southern Cross}}.&lt;ref name=Grose111 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill, ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', p. 593&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portmar'' was salvaged and reconditioned by U.S. Army port-battalion troops, towed to Sydney, and repaired.&lt;ref name=Masterson /&gt;&lt;ref name=2Gill261&gt;Gill, ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was purchased at Brisbane by the War Department on 17 November 1942 and incorporated into the U.S. Army's permanent local fleet as an Army transport.&lt;ref name=MARAD /&gt;&lt;ref name=Masterson /&gt;
