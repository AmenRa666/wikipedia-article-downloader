[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] '''Sir Edward Nicolls'''{{refn|group=note|Contemporary records, and historians into the 21st century, often render the spelling of his name as &quot;Edward Nicholls&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter One: The War in the South|title=The Battle of New Orleans|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/remini-battle.html|year=1999 |first=Robert V. |last=Remini|isbn=0-670-88551-7|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KCB}} (1779 – 5 February 1865) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] officer of the [[Royal Marines]]. Known as &quot;Fighting Nicolls&quot;, he had a distinguished military career, being involved in reputedly at least 107 actions across the world during his 40 years of service, and was wounded in combat numerous times.{{refn|group=note|His obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' said &quot;The deceased General was one of the oldest officers in the service, his first commission bearing date in 1795&amp;nbsp;... He was in no fewer than 107 actions, in various parts of the world&amp;nbsp;... He had his left leg broken and his right leg severely injured, was shot through the body and right arm, had received a severe sabre cut in the head, was bayoneted in the chest, and had lost the sight of an eye.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Times|date=9 February 1865|page=12|title= Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nicolls was born in [[Coleraine]], Ireland, in a family with a military tradition, and raised there until entering school in [[Greenwich]]. In 1795, at the age of 15, he received his first commission in the Royal Marines, and began service with shipborne detachments of marines. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and associated conflicts in the Caribbean, Mediterranean, and North Sea, he served as a commander of ships' detachments, and gained his reputation for ferocity and courage.

During the [[War of 1812]], Nicolls was posted to [[Spanish Florida]] as part of the British attempt to recruit local allies in the fight against the United States. As the war ended and after he returned to England in 1815, he attracted controversy by advocating for the [[Muscogee|Creeks]] and other locals who allied themselves with the British. From 1823 to 1828, he was the commandant of [[Ascension Island]] in the South Atlantic, which was followed by a posting from 1829 to 1835, as Superintendent of [[Bioko|Fernando Po]] off the coast of Africa. In 1835, Nicolls retired from the Royal Marines with the rank of a [[lieutenant colonel]]. For his service, Nicolls was made a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]], among other honours, and was promoted to the rank of full [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] in his retirement.

==Early life==
Edward Nicolls was born in 1779 in [[Coleraine]], Ireland, the son of Jonathan Nicolls and Anna Cuppage. Jonathan Nicolls (died 1818) was for a time controller of [[excise]] for Coleraine. Anna Cuppage (1757?–1845) was a daughter of the Reverend Burke Cuppage, [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of Coleraine, a close kinsman and friend of [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentleman's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=IrishDirectory&gt;{{cite journal|page= 83 |publisher=Ulster Genealogical and Historical Guild|journal=Directory of Irish Family History Research |issue= 27|year= 2004|title= Document 4724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna had an older brother [[William Cuppage]] (1756–1832), who had an appointment secured for him at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] by Edmund Burke. William was later a lieutenant general of the [[Royal Artillery]] and a neighbour of Edward Nicolls in Woolwich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The United service magazine|title=General officers lately deceased: Lieutenant General William Cuppage|issue= 1|pages= 518–520|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pQwcAQAAIAAJ|year=1833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was the oldest of six siblings,&lt;ref name=IrishDirectory/&gt; and some of his brothers had distinguished military careers as well, including Lieutenant Colonel William Burke Nicolls (1780–1844) of the [[British Army]]'s [[2nd West India Regiment]], and Commander Jonathan Frederick Nicolls (1782–1845) of the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C9658468|title= ADM 196/5/414: Nicolls, Jonathan, Commander|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All five of Edward Nicolls' brothers and both of his sons died in or as the result of public service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentleman's&quot;/&gt; Nicolls was educated at a grammar school in Coleraine and at Royal Park Academy near [[Greenwich]] prior to entering the Marines on 24 March 1795.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentleman's&quot;/&gt; He was not yet 16 years old when he received his commission as a [[second lieutenant]] in His Majesty's Marine Forces, in 1795, and he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] on 27 January 1796.&lt;ref name=CommonsBath&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Accounts and Papers of the House of Commons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKxbAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=edward%20nicolls%20january%201796&amp;pg=PT315#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20nicolls%20january%201796&amp;f=false |year=1858 |page=6|title=Names of Officers in the Army and Navy Who Have Been Decorated With the Order of the Bath Since 1 January 1854|author1= House of Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Napoleonic Wars===
It was during his early career, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], that Nicolls earned his reputation as &quot;Fighting Nicolls&quot;, for as an officer on small ships, he was engaged in numerous fierce actions on small boats and at gun batteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentleman's&quot;/&gt; On 5 November 1803, during the [[blockade of Saint-Domingue]], Lieutenant Nicolls took a 12-man cutting-out party in the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] from [[HMS Blanche (1800)|HMS ''Blanche'']] and captured the French cutter ''Albion'' from under the battery at Monte Christi. ''Albion'' had a crew of 43 men and was armed with two 4-pounder guns and six [[swivel gun]]s. The British lost two dead, and two wounded including Nicolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1837}}, vol. III, [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pbtyc/Naval_History/Vol_III/Vol_III_P_201.htm pp. 201–203]&lt;/ref&gt; In single combat, the French captain wounded Nicolls severely with a pistol shot before himself being killed. For his courage in this action, Nicolls was awarded with a sword valued at £30 by the committee of Lloyds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentleman's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolas|1845|p= 317}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804 Nicolls led another boat assault in the capture of a French [[brig]], and led a landing party of Royal Marines in the siege of Franco-Dutch forces at [[Curaçao]]. Nicolls and his men withstood 28 consecutive days of continuous enemy assaults on their positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentleman's&quot;/&gt;

On 25 July 1805, Nicolls was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]], and assigned command of a company which embarked in [[HMS Standard (1782)|HMS ''Standard'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentleman's&quot;/&gt; During 1807 and 1808, Nicolls participated in the siege of [[Corfu]] and in a foray to Egypt. It was during this period, too, that he was honourably [[Mentioned in Despatches|mentioned in dispatches]] for his part in the [[Dardanelles Operation]], during which he captured a Turkish flag.&lt;ref name=Harts1865&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Annual Army List and Militia List for 1865|year=1865|publisher=John Murray|location=London|first=H. G.|last=Hart|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GaXAy7eESxIC&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=nicolls&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1837}}, vol. IV, [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pbtyc/Naval_History/Vol_IV/Vol_IV_P_303.htm p. 303]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1808 he led the boat attack from the ''Standard'' which captured the Italian [[gunboat]] ''Volpe'' off Corfu.&lt;ref name=Harts1865/&gt;

In 1809, Nicolls commanded HMS ''Standard''{{'}}s marines while the ship participated in the [[Gunboat War]]. On 18 May Nicolls' marines assisted marines and seamen under the command of Captain William Selby of [[HMS Owen Glendower (1808)|HMS ''Owen Glendower'']] in the capture of the island of [[Anholt (Denmark)|Anholt]]. In the skirmish, a Danish garrison of 170 men put up a sharp but ineffectual resistance that killed one British marine and wounded two before surrendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1837}}, vol. V, [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pbtyc/Naval_History/Vol_V/P_130.html p. 130]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the capture of Anholt, Nicolls was briefly assigned as the British military governor of the island.&lt;ref name=Harts1865/&gt; On 8 August 1810, Nicolls received the [[brevet (military)|brevet]] rank of major.&lt;ref name=CommonsBath/&gt;

=== War of 1812 ===

==== Posting to Florida ====
During the [[War of 1812]], Nicolls was posted to [[Spanish Florida]] as part of an attempt to recruit the [[Seminole]]s as allies against the United States. He was to operate from a position established in April 1814 at [[Negro Fort|Prospect Bluff]] (sometimes called the British Post, later the Negro Fort, replaced still later by Fort Gadsden). Sailing from [[Bermuda]] in the summer of 1814, the expedition Nicolls commanded stopped in Spanish [[Havana]], where it was told not to land in Florida without prior request by the Captain General, [[Juan Ruiz de Apodaca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall|1829|p= 65}}, letter from Captain Percy to Admiral Cochrane dated 9 September 1814&lt;/ref&gt; When Nicolls arrived at Prospect Bluff, Florida in August, the Spanish Governor of Pensacola, Don [[Mateo González Manrique]], aware of the threat the Americans posed to Florida, requested the redeployment of British forces to Pensacola.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall&quot; /&gt;

At Pensacola on 26 August 1814, Nicolls issued an order of the day for the 'First Colonial battalion of the Royal Corps of Marines', and at the same time issued a widely disseminated proclamation to the people of Louisiana, urging them to join forces with the British and Indian allies against the American government. Both proclamations were reproduced in ''[[Niles' Register]]'' of [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/nilesweeklyregis07balt#page/n143|title=[Untitled]|newspaper= Niles's Weekly Register|volume= 7 |pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were a ruse as to the real strength of the British. The &quot;numerous British and Spanish squadron of ships and vessels of war&quot; he described comprised two sloops and two [[sixth-rate]]s of the Royal Navy,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1837}}, vol. VI, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;good train of artillery&quot; comprised three cannon and twelve gunners, whilst the &quot;[[battalion]]&quot; was a company-strength group of 100 Royal Marines infantry, detached from Major [[George Lewis (Royal Marines officer)|George Lewis]]'s battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahon|1991|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers of [[Corps of Colonial Marines]] and Redstick Creeks are difficult to ascertain, although Nicolls did arrive in Florida with 300 British uniforms and 1000 muskets. Manrique cooperated with Nicolls, allowing him to train and drill [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] refugees.&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mark F.|last= Boyd|url=http://digitool.fcla.edu/R/?func=search-simple-go&amp;LOCAL_BASE=GEN01&amp;pds_handle=GUEST&amp;REQUEST=SN00154113%200016%20002|title=Events at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River, 1808–18|journal=Florida Historical Quarterly|date=October 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latour|1816|p=11}}. &quot;[Nicolls] enlisted and publicly drilled Indians, who wore the British uniform in the streets [of Pensacola].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolls is mentioned in attempts to recruit [[Jean Lafitte]] to the British cause.&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt;

==== Fort Bowyer and New Orleans ====
Nicolls participated in an unsuccessful land and naval attack on [[Fort Bowyer]] on 15 September. In the fighting, Nicolls was wounded severely three times, and he lost the use of his right eye for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentleman's&quot;/&gt; The [[Battle of Pensacola (1814)|taking of Pensacola]] in November by an American force under [[Andrew Jackson]] forced Nicolls to retreat to the [[Apalachicola River]] with freed slaves from Pensacola. There, Nicolls regrouped at Prospect Bluff, and rallied Indians and refugee ex-slaves living free in Florida, recruiting the latter into his detached unit of the Corps of Colonial Marines.&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt;

At the start of December, Nicolls was directed to join the expedition against New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Owsley|1981|p=176}}, quoting from Cochrane's log dated 3 December 1814, document reference ADM 50/122&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolls joined General [[Edward Pakenham]]'s force, accompanied by less than 100 Seminole, Creek, and Choctaw warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=John|last= Sugden|url=http://digitool.fcla.edu/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=3169504&amp;custom_att|title=The Southern Indians in the War of 1812: The Closing Phase|journal=Florida Historical Quarterly|date=January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of New Orleans]] on 8 January 1815, Nicolls was attached, with some of his men, to the brigade commanded by Colonel [[William Thornton (British Army officer)|William Thornton]] of the [[85th Regiment of Foot (Bucks Volunteers)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DNB|volume=56|wstitle=Thornton, William (1779?-1840)|last=Vetch|first=Robert Hamilton|pages=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolls was the senior-ranking officer of the Royal Marines present at the battle, but Vice Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane]] forbade Nicolls to take part in the fighting personally, fearing that mishap to Nicolls might deprive the British of their most competent officer serving with the Creeks and Seminoles.{{refn|group=note|1=Nicolls's obituary in ''The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Review'' states that &quot;He was the senior major of all the force before New Orleans in 1815, and as such urged his right to lead the battalion of Royal Marines in the assault. This honour was refused, on the ground that if any accident befell him there would be no other officer competent to command his Indian Army [sic]; in consequence of this, he lost the decoration of the Bath, which was conferred on Major Adair, R.M., who so nobly led the battalion.&quot; On the same page it was additionally recalled that Nicolls was still suffering from the effects of three serious wounds received in the attack on Fort Bowyer just months earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentleman's&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Review|volume=218 |year=1865 |pages= 644–646|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027525826;q1=nicolls;start=1;size=100;page=root;view=image;seq=668;num=644|title=Obituary.—Gen. Sir Edward Nicolls, K. C. B}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The actual battlefield command of the 100 Royal Marines brigaded with the 85th Foot went to a less senior officer, Major Thomas Benjamin Adair, commanding officer of the Marine detachment on [[HMS Vengeur (1810)|HMS ''Vengeur'']].&lt;ref name=Harts1865/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Navy List, Corrected to the End of January 1815|page= 72|publisher=John Murray|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0xYYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA145|accessdate=4 January 2013|year=1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolls embarked [[HMS Erebus (1807)|HMS ''Erebus'']] on 12 January at Cat Island Roads, and disembarked at [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]] on 25 January, accompanied by several Creek warriors and a number of Royal Marine reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADM 37/4652: HMS ''Erebus'' ship muster|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C6205716|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== End of the war ====
The start of 1815 was to have seen a British offensive in the south, with the [[Royal Marines Battalions (Napoleonic Wars)|Royal Marine Battalions]] to advance westward into Georgia, to be joined by Nicolls and his forces from the Gulf Coast.&lt;ref name=NGE&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-616|title=War of 1812 and Georgia|encyclopedia=New Georgia Encyclopedia|author=Smith, Gerald Judson Jr.|date=28 August 2002|accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans were overtaken by events, as peace was declared following the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Ghent]]. With the offensive cancelled, Nicolls and his men returned to Prospect Bluff.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Tales of Angola: Free Blacks, Red Stick Creeks, and International Intrigue in Spanish Southwest Florida, 1812–1821|title=Go Sound the Trumpet: Selections in Florida's African American History|year=2005|editors=Brown, Canter Jr.; David H. Jackson, Jr.|publisher=University of Tampa Press|url=http://www.africanaheritage.com/BrownTalesofAngolaexcerpt.asp|location=Tampa, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 1815, a U.S. Army aide-de-camp named Walter Bourke communicated to Major General [[Thomas Pinckney]] that conditions were difficult on the Georgia frontier despite efforts to reinforce American defences, and to negotiate the return of slaves who had joined the Corps of Colonial Marines under the command of Rear Admiral [[George Cockburn]] still at [[Cumberland Island]]. Cockburn was not inclined to voluntarily hand over British military personnel who risked being returned to slavery by the Americans, and professed difficulty in communicating news of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] to Nicolls.&lt;ref name=NGE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Georgia Military: War of 1812 Correspondence, Bourke to Pinckney|publisher= USGenWeb Archives |url= http://www.usgwarchives.net/ga/gafiles.htm |title=Letter with enclosures, 1815 Mar. 15, Savannah, Georgia to Major General Pinckney/W. Bourke|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolls contributed to these post-war diplomatic tensions between the United Kingdom and the United States, by attempting to represent the interests of the Native Americans and blacks who had taken up arms on the British side. Prior to returning to Great Britain, Nicolls engaged in a heated exchange of letters with U.S. Indian Agent [[Benjamin Hawkins]]. Hawkins accused Nicolls of being overzealous and of overstepping his authority in his personal defence of Redstick Creeks, Seminoles, and their Marron Creole allies, who some Americans in authority viewed as nothing more than runaway slaves and lost or unclaimed property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Niles' Weekly Register|title=War Events/Indian Affairs of Saturday|date=24 June 1815 |pages= 285–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seminoles|pages= 69–71|first= Edwin C.|last= McReynolds|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location= Norman, Oklahoma|origyear=1957|year=1972|isbn= 0-8061-1255-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar tensions existed with the Spanish. Writing from HMS ''Royal Oak'', off Mobile Bay, on 15 March 1815, Rear Admiral [[Pulteney Malcolm]], Cochrane's subordinate commander of the Mobile Squadron, assured Don Mateo Gonzalez Manrique, the Governor at Pensacola, that Post-Captain Robert Cavendish Spencer (a son of [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer]]) of {{HMS|Carron|1813|6}}, had been detailed to conduct a strict enquiry into the conduct of Nicolls and Captain Woodbine, regarding the property losses of Spanish inhabitants of Florida.

Nicolls received orders to withdraw his troops from the fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Covington|1993|p= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Marine detachment embarked on {{HMS|Cydnus|1813|6}} on 22 April, and were duly returned to Ireland Island in Bermuda, arriving on 13 June 1815, to rejoin the 3rd Battalion as a supernumerary company.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Spencer to Cochrane dated 17 February 1816 does mention that the Indian Chiefs were 'obeying Brevet Major Nicolls' orders until 22 April [1815]'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C538685|title=ADM 96/471: 3rd Battalion Royal Marines muster/pay Lists Jan to Oct 1815|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolls left in mid-May 1815 with the Redstick Creek Prophet, Josiah Francis (also known as Hillis Hadjo, the Native American spiritual and political leader known for his role in the [[Battle of Holy Ground]]), and an Anglo-Creek-Seminole treaty of Nicolls' own initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WO 1/143 folios 147–150: Indian agreement dated 10 March 1815| url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C2488982 |work= National Archives|accessdate=12 September 2012|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June 1815, Nicolls, Woodbine, and Francis arrived at [[Amelia Island]], in [[East Florida]], where rumours circulated that the officers were seeking to either obtain British possession of Florida from Spain, or to arm and supply the Florida factions resisting American territorial expansion. In fact, Nicolls had been heading to the Bahamas, and had unintentionally ended up in East Florida.{{refn|group=note|A letter from Nicolls to Anthony St. John Baker, HM Chargé D'Affaires, Washington, dated 12 June 1815, written at Amelia Island, says &quot;I had intended to write to you from the Bahamas&amp;nbsp;... but being obliged to put in here in distress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= WO 1/143 folios 168–169|page=118| url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C2488982 |publisher= National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In leaving West Florida, according to the U.S. Indian Agent Hawkins, Nicolls had left local forces with the arms and means to resist advancing American encroachments which were leading up to Andrew Jackson's [[First Seminole War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| pages= 311, 347 |date=15 July 1815|newspaper=Niles' Weekly Register|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolls embarked on the brig HMS ''Forward'' on 29 June &quot;for passage to England&quot;, and disembarked at Portsmouth on 13 September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Marines on the Gulf Coast&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelsonandhisworld.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=1569&amp;sid=5a4ef12603261b952d183b69e7c2289e|title=Royal Marines on the Gulf Coast|accessdate=3 June 2014|quote=Extracted information from the muster of HMS ''Forward''...&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aftermath ====
In England, Nicolls failed to obtain official support for the Creeks, and Josiah Francis failed to receive official recognition for his credentials as the Redstick Creek emissary from the [[Foreign Office]], although he did receive recognition as a former Colonel of the British Army in Florida as well as publicized encounters with British notables, before returning to [[West Florida]] in 1816. Josiah Francis and another Seminole leader, Nehemathla Micco, were summarily executed by the Americans in Spanish territorial waters in April 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cmamcrk4/crkchf1.html|title=Indian Chiefs |page= 1 |first= William C. |last=Bell | year=2008 | origyear=1951 | accessdate = 12 September 2012 | publisher = Carol Middleton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Covington|1993|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolls himself was retained on full pay status in the duties of a captain and brevet major of the Royal Marines. While he was in America, he had the local rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] (by authority of Vice Admiral Cochrane) as he was commander of a battalion of the Corps of Colonial Marines. He was awarded a pension of £250 annually on 28 December 1815 for a total of 24 serious battle wounds suffered, and awarded a sword of honour by Britain's Patriotic Fund. He was made a brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 August 1819.&lt;ref name=Harts1865/&gt;

In the summer of 1817 Captain George Woodbine, one of Nicolls's former subordinate officers, was present in Spanish East Florida together with the former British soldier and Scottish mercenary lieutenant of [[Simon Bolivar]], [[Gregor MacGregor]]. Woodbine and MacGregor both left Spanish East Florida to rejoin the Latin American revolutionary movement prior to U.S. military intervention in East Florida. The names of Nicolls, Woodbine, and MacGregor had become associated with the arming of blacks as soldiers, militiamen, and even as mercenaries. The threat, real or imaginary, was an anathema to North American popular conceptions of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|volume=23|issue=1 |year=1944|pages=39–44|jstor=30145383|last1=Davis|first1=T.

Between July and October 1818, the ''Niles' Weekly Register'' of Baltimore published portions of correspondence between Nicolls and the former auxiliary Second Lieutenant Robert Chrystie Armbrister (1797–1818) of the first &quot;battalion&quot; of the Corps of Colonial Marines. Armbrister was one of two British subjects executed in the [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident]] by order of Major General Andrew Jackson following a drumhead trial at [[St. Marks, Florida|Saint Marks]] in West Florida in April 1818. In the correspondence, assistance was asked of Nicolls to intervene with the British government on behalf of former allies seeking asylum in Spanish West Florida from perceived American wrongdoing and injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Niles' Weekly Register|location= Baltimore|date=4 October 1818|issue= 6|volume= XV|pages=845–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ascension Island===
In 1823, Nicolls became the first Royal Marines commandant of [[Ascension Island]], a small volcanic island in the South Atlantic, halfway between South America and Africa. In 1815, [[HMS Zenobia (1807)|HMS ''Zenobia'']] and [[HMS Peruvian (1808)|HMS ''Peruvian'']] had taken the island to prevent it from being used as a staging post from which to rescue [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] from [[Saint Helena]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart-Davis|first=Duff|authorlink=Duff Hart-Davis|year=1973|title=Ascension: Story of a South Atlantic Island|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0-385-00314-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1815 until Nicolls took over, the Royal Navy registered the island as a &quot;small [[Sloop]] of 50 or 60 Men&quot;, HMS ''Ascension'', since the Navy was forbidden to govern colonies. The island had a garrison of about thirty, with a few families, servants, and liberated Africans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;/&gt; The Royal Navy came to use the island as a victualling station for ships, particularly those of the [[West Africa Squadron]] (or Preventative Squadron), which were working to suppress the [[transatlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shallman|2003|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water was scarce, and an important task for Nicolls was to ensure that the island had a stable source of water. He achieved this by installing systems of pipes and carts to bring water to the settlement from the few springs in the mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;/&gt; Food was mostly shipped from England, but some could be procured locally: fish, a few vegetables grown on the island, feral goats and sheep, fishy-tasting eggs from a [[tern]] colony on the island, and turtle meat obtained during the laying season from December to May. Due to Nicolls's efforts in directing the harvest of turtles, turtle meat, an expensive delicacy in England, became so common it was fed to prisoners and pigs, and Marines complained of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;/&gt; This surfeit of turtle irritated Nicolls's superiors and the [[Lords of the Admiralty]], and when an admiral ordered Nicolls to stop feeding turtle to prisoners, he started selling or bartering it to visiting ships. With this monotonous diet, men on the island relied on rum for spice. Nicolls understood this, and gave large rations of grog when his men showed what he called &quot;spirited and Soldierlike feelings&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;/&gt;

On the confines of the island feuds were vicious, and one surgeon went insane. Pirates were frequently seen off Ascension, keeping the garrison on edge. Nicolls was also busied by many infrastructure projects on the island, building roads, water tanks, a storehouse, and developing the gardens on [[Green Mountain]]. For these efforts, Nicolls had about sixty freed Africans sent to Ascension, and additionally asked for convicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;/&gt;

Nicolls had many such grand schemes for trade between Britain and its colonies, but these all failed to materialise. These schemes included a plan to grow [[oak]]s in the unlikely location of [[Sierra Leone]] for Royal Navy ships, a plan to ship Ascension rocks to England, and a plan to ship [[New Zealand flax]] to England which he discussed in a letter to [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Lieut.-Colonel Nicolls to Earl Bathurst|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-McN01Hist-t1-b9-d46.html|title=Historical Records of New Zealand|volume= I|year=1908|editor=McNab, Robert|accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 1828 Captain William Bate replaced Nicolls as commandant on Ascension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Avis|first=Graham|title=An Introduction to the History of Ascension Island|year=2002|url=http://www.heritage.org.ac/HS1frameset.htm|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolls was given the substantive rank of major before leaving, on 8 May 1828.&lt;ref name=CommonsBath/&gt;

===Fernando Po===
In April 1829, Nicolls was appointed Superintendent of [[Bioko|Fernando Po]] (now Bioko), a tropical island immediately off the coast of Africa, which the West Africa Squadron used as a base for operations against the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Obichere|editor-first=Boniface I.|last=Mbaeyi|first=Paul M.|title=Studies in Southern Nigerian history|contribution=The British Navy and 'Southern Nigeria' in the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FYFxE8-uSa4C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203|year=1982|isbn=978-0-7146-3106-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolls received the appointment after colonial administrator and anti-slave trade crusader [[William Fitzwilliam Owen]] had refused the post, and after merchant [[John Beecroft]] was deemed unfit for the post. Owen, however, voiced his dissatisfaction with what he viewed as Nicolls's harsh rule on the island, and Beecroft increased his influence in the area. Nicolls, in turn, attacked Beecroft for his dealings with former slavers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sundiata&quot;/&gt; Nicolls's health suffered in Fernando Po and by April 1830 he had left for Ascension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Times|date=11 June 1830|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Nicolls returned to England ill, Beecroft was placed in temporary charge of the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sundiata&quot;/&gt;

Tropical illness took a toll on the Europeans at Fernando Po, where hundreds died during Nicolls's time there. Nineteen of the 34 men in Nicolls's first contingent died soon after their arrival, and only five of the original 47 Royal Marines who accompanied him to Fernando Po in 1829 survived two years of duty on the station. Nicolls, somewhat restored to health, served a second term as Superintendent of Fernando Po during 1832–1833.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sundiata&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sundiata|1996|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Equatorial_Guinea.html|title=Equatorial Guinea|work=WorldStatesmen.org|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his differences with Owen, Nicolls was just as determined to disrupt the slave trade, and equally energetic in his attempts to convince the British government to adopt a more aggressive stance. Frustrated in territorial annexation schemes, he invited the West African rulers of Bimbia, Old Calabar, Camaroon, Malimba, and the Bonny to Fernando Po to form an anti-slavery alliance. To Nicolls' disappointment, the British government ordered him to evacuate Fernando Po on 29 August 1832, and put an end to operations there. Unfinished work and efforts to provide for the welfare of liberated and displaced slave populations delayed the end of Nicolls's mandate for several months, and he did not return to England until April 1835.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sundiata&quot;/&gt;

During his time in control of Fernando Po, Nicolls clashed with the Portuguese authorities on the neighbouring islands of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], regarding his refusal to return escaped slaves. In a February 1842 letter to ''The Times'' he said he was accused by the Portuguese governor, Senhor Ferreira, of deliberately enticing slaves to run away and of encouraging &quot;thieves&quot; and &quot;murderers&quot;. This charge he denied, asserting that he had never actively encouraged slaves from nearby islands to make the dangerous crossing to Fernando Po: but that if they chose to do so, it was his duty under British law not to return them to slavery. He considered those slaves who killed in the course of their escapes as legally and morally justified in their action; nor did he regard them as thieves for having seized canoes to escape in. He offered to return any stolen canoes, and wrote that if Ferreira could persuade any of the escapees to return voluntarily to a state of slavery, he would not impede them. He wrote to ''The Times'' during the debate which followed the [[Creole case|''Creole'' case]], in which slaves transported aboard the American vessel ''Creole'' had taken control of her and forced the crew to take them to a British-run port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Times|date=16 February 1842|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life and family ==
Nicolls retired from the Royal Marines, and was given the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel, on 15 May 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/navylist15admigoog#page/n546/mode/2up |title=The Navy List, Corrected to the 20th March, 1835|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1835|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 1840, he received the brevet British Army rank of [[colonel]], postdated to 10 January 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=19910|startpage=2410|date= November 1840}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a good-service pension of £150 per annum on 30 June 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Navy List|chapter=Good Service Pensions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qukNAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=navy%20list%201810&amp;pg=PA271#v=onepage&amp;q=nicolls&amp;f=false|page=271|first=Charles|last=Haultain|year=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 November 1846 he was promoted to the brevet Army rank of [[major general]], in June 1854 he was advanced to [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|lieutenant general]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21564|date=22 June 1854|startpage=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; and just a year later in June 1855 he was promoted to full [[General (United Kingdom)|general]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21735|startpage=2457|date=June 1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1855 he was made [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=2655|date=10 July 1855|issue=21743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809, while still a young captain of Marines, Nicolls married Miss Eleanor Bristow (1792–1880), who was also from northern Ireland. They had the following children:

Nicolls died at his residence in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], London on 5 February 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries|newspaper=Illustrated London News|date=18 February 1865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleanor survived her husband 15 years, dying on 24 November 1880 at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Times|date=27 November 1880|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
