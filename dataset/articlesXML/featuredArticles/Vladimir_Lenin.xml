'''Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov''',{{efn|{{lang-ru|link=no|Владимир Ильич Ульянов}} {{IPA-ru|vlɐˈdʲimʲɪr ɪˈlʲitɕ ʊˈlʲanəf|}}.}} better known by the alias '''Lenin'''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|n|ɪ|n}};&lt;ref name=&quot;Wesbters&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lenin |title=Lenin |website=Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|link=no|Ленин}} {{IPA-ru|lʲenʲɪn|}}.}} ({{OldStyleDate|22 April|1870|10 April}} &amp;nbsp;– 21 January 1924), was a Russian [[Communism|communist]] revolutionary, politician, and [[political theory|political theorist]]. He served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|head of government]] of the [[Russian Republic]] from 1917 to 1918, of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] from 1918 to 1924, and of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[communist state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]]. Ideologically a [[Marxism|Marxist]], he developed political theories known as [[Leninism]].

&lt;!--Early life and revolutionary activity--&gt;  
Born to a wealthy middle-class family in [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]], Lenin embraced [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] politics following [[Aleksandr Ulyanov|his brother's execution]] in 1887. Expelled from [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]] for participating in protests against the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist regime]], he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1893 and became a senior figure in the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP). In 1897, he was arrested for [[sedition]] and exiled to [[Shushenskoye]] for three years, where he married [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent party theorist through his publications. In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik faction]] against [[Julius Martov]]'s [[Mensheviks]]. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed [[Revolution of 1905]], he later campaigned for the [[First World War]] to be transformed into a Europe-wide [[proletarian revolution]], which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] and its replacement with [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] ousted the Tsar and established a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the [[October Revolution]], in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.

&lt;!--October Revolution and Lenin's government--&gt; 
[[Council of People's Commissars|Lenin's government]] was led by the Bolsheviks—now renamed the Communist Party—with some powers initially also held by elected [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|soviet]]s. The new government called elections for the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] and then abolished it, withdrew from the First World War by signing a [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|treaty]] with the [[Central Powers]], and granted independence to non-Russian nations under Russian control. It redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. Opponents were suppressed in the [[Red Terror]], a violent campaign orchestrated by the [[Cheka|state security services]]; tens of thousands were killed and others interned in [[Gulag|concentration camps]]. Anti-Bolshevik armies, established by both [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] groups, were defeated in the [[Russian Civil War]] from 1917 to 1922. Responding to wartime devastation, [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]], and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin promoted economic growth through a [[New Economic Policy|mixed economic system]]. Seeking to promote [[world revolution]], Lenin's government created the [[Communist International]], waged the [[Polish–Soviet War]], and [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|united Russia]] with neighbouring nations to form the Soviet Union in 1922. In increasingly poor health, Lenin expressed opposition to the growing power of his successor, [[Joseph Stalin]], before dying at [[Gorki Leninskiye|his Gorki mansion]].

&lt;!--Reception and legacy--&gt;  
Widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive [[personality cult]] within the Soviet Union until [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind [[Marxism-Leninism]] and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive individual, Lenin is viewed by Marxist-Leninists as a champion of socialism and the working class, while critics on both the left and right see him as the founder of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] dictatorship responsible for mass human rights abuses.

==Early life==
{{Main article|Early life of Vladimir Lenin}}

===Childhood: 1870–87===

Lenin's father, [[Ilya Ulyanov|Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov]], was from a family of [[Kalmyks|Kalmyk]], [[Russians|Russian]], and [[Chuvash_people|Chuvash]] [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=1–2|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12–13|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=7|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=21–23|5a1=White|5y=2001|5pp=13–15|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=6}} Despite this lower-class background he had risen to middle-class status, studying physics and mathematics at [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]] before teaching at the [[Institute for Nobles|Penza Institute for the Nobility]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=1–2|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12–13|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=21–23|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=13–15|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=6}} Ilya married [[Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova|Maria Alexandrovna Blank]] in mid-1863.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=5|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=13|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=23}} Well educated and from a relatively prosperous background, she was the daughter of a [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|German]]–[[Swedish diaspora|Swedish]] woman and a [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] physician who had [[Apostasy in Judaism|converted to Christianity]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=2–3|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=12|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=16–19, 23|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=15–18|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=5|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=20}} Soon after their wedding, Ilya obtained a job in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], rising to become Director of Primary Schools in the [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]] district six years later. Five years after that, he was promoted to Director of Public Schools for the province, overseeing the foundation of over 450 schools as a part of the government's plans for modernisation. His dedication to education earned him the [[Order of St. Vladimir]], which bestowed on him the status of [[Russian nobility|hereditary nobleman]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=6|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=13–14, 18|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=25, 27|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=18–19|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5pp=4, 8|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=21}}

[[File:Dom ulyanovyh.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Lenin's childhood home in Simbirsk]]

The couple had two children, Anna (born 1864) and [[Aleksandr Ulyanov|Alexander]] (born 1868), before Lenin was born as Vladimir &quot;Volodya&quot; Ilyich in Simbirsk on 10 April 1870, and [[infant baptism|baptised]] several days later. They were followed by three more children, Olga (born 1871), Dmitry (born 1874), and Maria (born 1878). Two later siblings died in infancy.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=6|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12, 14|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=13, 25|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=19–20|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=4|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6pp=21, 22}} Ilya was a devout member of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and baptised his children into it, although Maria&amp;nbsp;– a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]&amp;nbsp;– was largely indifferent to Christianity, a view that influenced her children.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=3, 8|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=14–15|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=29}} 

Both parents were [[monarchism|monarchists]] and [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]], being committed to the [[emancipation reform of 1861]] introduced by the reformist [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]; they avoided political radicals and there is no evidence that the police ever put them under surveillance for subversive thought.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=8|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=27|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=19}} Every summer they holidayed at a rural manor in [[Lenino-Kokushkino|Kokushkino]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=18|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=26|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=20|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=7|5a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|5y=2010|5p=64}} Among his siblings, Lenin was closest to his sister Olga, whom he often bossed around; he had an extremely competitive nature and could be destructive, but usually admitted his misbehaviour.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=7|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=16|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=32–36}} A keen sportsman, he spent much of his free time outdoors or playing chess, and excelled at school, the disciplinarian and conservative Simbirsk Classical Gimnazia.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=7|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=17|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=36–46|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=20|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=9}}

Ilya Ulyanov died of a [[brain haemorrhage]] in January 1886, when Lenin was 16.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=6, 9|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=19|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=48–49|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=10}} Subsequently, Lenin's behaviour became erratic and confrontational, and he soon renounced his belief in God.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=9|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=50–51, 64|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=16|4a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|4y=2010|4p=69}} At the time, Lenin's elder brother Alexander was studying at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]]. Involved in political agitation against the [[absolute monarchy]] of the [[reactionary]] Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], he studied the writings of banned leftists and organised anti-government protests. He joined a revolutionary cell bent on assassinating the Tsar and was selected to construct a bomb. Before the attack could take place the conspirators were arrested and tried, and in May, his brother Alexander was executed by hanging.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=10–17|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=20, 22–24|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=52–58|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=21–28|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=10|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6pp=23–25}} Despite the emotional trauma of his father's and brother's deaths, Lenin continued studying, graduated with a gold medal for exceptional performance, and decided to study law at Kazan University.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=25|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=61|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=29|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=16}}

===University and political radicalisation: 1887–93===

[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lenin came under the influence of [[Karl Marx]].]]

Upon entering Kazan University in August 1887, Lenin moved into a nearby flat.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=26|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=61–63}} There, he joined a ''[[zemlyachestvo]]'', a form of university society that represented the men of a particular region.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=26–27|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=64–68, 70|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=29}}  This group elected him as its representative to the university's ''zemlyachestvo'' council, and in December, he took part in a demonstration against government restrictions that banned student societies. The police arrested Lenin and accused him of being a ringleader in the demonstration; he was expelled from the university, and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] exiled him to his family's Kokushkino estate.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=27|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=68–69|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=29|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=15|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=32}} There, he read voraciously, becoming enamoured with [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]]'s 1863 pro-revolutionary novel ''[[What Is To Be Done? (novel)|What Is To Be Done?]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=28|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=30|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=12|5a1=Lih|5y=2011|5pp=32–33}} 

Lenin's mother was concerned by her son's radicalisation, and was instrumental in convincing the Interior Ministry to allow him to return to the city of [[Kazan]], although not the university.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=310|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=71}} On his return, he joined [[Nikolai Fedoseev]]'s revolutionary circle, through which he discovered [[Karl Marx]]'s 1867 book ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]''. This sparked his interest in [[Marxism]], a socio-political theory that argued that society developed in stages, that this development resulted from [[class struggle]], and that [[capitalism|capitalist society]] would ultimately give way to [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]] and then [[communist society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=19|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=32–33|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=72|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=30–31|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=18|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=33}} Wary of his political views, Lenin's mother bought a country estate in Alakaevka village, [[Samara Oblast]], in the hope that her son would turn his attention to agriculture.

[[File:Union-de-Lucha.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Lenin (seated centre) with other members of the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class in 1897]]

Refused legal representation or bail, Lenin denied all charges against him but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=31|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=48–51|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=107–108|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=31|5a1=Lih|5y=2011|5p=61}} He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work he noted that the rise of [[industrial capitalism]] in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants to move to the cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop [[class consciousness]], which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow [[Tsarism]], the [[aristocracy]], and the [[bourgeoisie]] and to establish a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|proletariat state]] that would move toward socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=31|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=48–51|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=107–108}}

In February 1897, he was sentenced without trial to three years exile in eastern Siberia, although granted a few days in Saint Petersburg to put his affairs in order.

Deemed only a minor threat to the government, he was exiled to a peasant's hut in [[Shushenskoye]], [[Minusinsky District]], where he was kept under police surveillance; he was nevertheless able to correspond with other revolutionaries, many of whom visited him, and permitted to go on trips to swim in the [[Yenisei River]] and to hunt [[duck]] and [[snipe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=31–32|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=53, 55–56|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=110–113|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=40|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5pp=30, 31}}

In May 1898, Nadya joined him in exile, having been arrested in August 1896 for organising a strike.

In response to the revolution of 1905, Tsar [[Nicholas II]] accepted a series of liberal reforms in his [[October Manifesto]], after which Lenin felt it safe to return to St. Petersburg.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=51|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=94|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=175–176|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=81|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5pp=77, 81|6a1=Rappaport|6y=2010|6pp=132, 134–135}} Joining the editorial board of ''Novaya Zhizn'' (&quot;''New Life&quot;''), a radical legal newspaper run by [[Maria Fyodorovna Andreyeva|Maria Andreyeva]], he used it to discuss issues facing the RSDLP.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=94–95|2a1=White|2y=2001|2pp=73–74|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=81–82|4a1=Rappaport|4y=2010|4p=138}} He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for a successful revolution.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=96–97|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=176–178}} Recognising that membership fees and donations from a few wealthy sympathisers were insufficient to finance the Bolsheviks' activities, Lenin endorsed the idea of robbing post offices, railway stations, trains, and banks. Under the lead of [[Leonid Krasin]], a group of Bolsheviks began carrying out such criminal actions, the best known taking place in June 1907, when a group of Bolsheviks acting under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]] committed [[1907 Tiflis bank robbery|an armed robbery of the State Bank]] in [[Tiflis]], Georgia.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=70–71|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=369–370|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=104}}

[[Alexander Bogdanov]] and other prominent Bolsheviks decided to relocate the Bolshevik Centre to Paris; although Lenin disagreed, he moved to the city in December 1908.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=186–187}} Lenin disliked Paris, lambasting it as &quot;a foul hole&quot;, and while there he sued a motorist who knocked him off his bike.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=67–68|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=111|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=188–189}} Lenin became very critical of Bogdanov's view that Russia's proletariat had to develop a socialist culture in order to become a successful revolutionary vehicle. Instead, Lenin favoured a vanguard of socialist intelligentsia who would lead the working-classes in revolution.

In May 1908, Lenin lived briefly in London, where he used the [[British Museum]] [[British Museum Reading Room|Reading Room]] to write ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]'', an attack on what he described as the &quot;bourgeois-reactionary falsehood&quot; of Bogdanov's relativism.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=64–67|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=110|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=192–193|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=84, 87–88|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=90}} Lenin's factionalism began to alienate increasing numbers of Bolsheviks, including his former close supporters [[Alexei Rykov]] and [[Lev Kamenev]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=69|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=111|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=195}} The Okhrana exploited his factionalist attitude by sending a spy, [[Roman Malinovsky]], to act as a vocal Lenin supporter within the party.

In August 1910, Lenin attended the [[International Socialist Congress, Copenhagen, 1910|Eighth Congress]] of the [[Second International]] – an international meeting of socialists – in [[Copenhagen]] as the RSDLP's representative, following this with a holiday in Stockholm with his mother.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=70|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=114–116}} With his wife and sisters he then moved to France, settling first in [[Bombon, Seine-et-Marne|Bombon]] and then Paris.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=68–69|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=112|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=195–196}} Here, he became a close friend to the French Bolshevik [[Inessa Armand]]; some biographers suggesting that they had an extra-marital affair from 1910 to 1912.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=75–80|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=112|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3p=384|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=197–199|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=103}} Meanwhile, at a Paris meeting in June 1911, the RSDLP Central Committee decided to move their focus of operations back to Russia, ordering the closure of the Bolshevik Centre and its newspaper, ''Proletari''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=115|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=196|3a1=White|3y=2001|3pp=93–94}} Seeking to rebuild his influence in the party, Lenin arranged for [[Prague Party Conference|a party conference]] to be held in [[Prague]] in January 1912, and although 16 of the 18 attendants were Bolsheviks, he was heavily criticised for his factionalist tendencies and failed to boost his status within the party.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=71–72|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=116–117|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=204–206|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=96–97|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=95}}

In September 1917, Lenin published ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'', which argued that [[imperialism]] was a product of [[monopoly capitalism]], as capitalists sought to increase their profits by extending into new territories where wages were lower and raw materials cheaper. He believed that competition and conflict would increase and that war between the imperialist powers would continue until they were overthrown by proletariat revolution and socialism established.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=95–100, 107|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=132–134|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=245–246|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=118–121|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5pp=116–126}} He spent much of this time reading the works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], and [[Aristotle]], all of whom had been key influences on Marx.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=241–242}} This changed Lenin's interpretation of Marxism; whereas he once believed that policies could be developed based on predetermined scientific principles, he concluded that the only test of whether a policy was correct was its practice.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=243}} Although still perceiving himself as an orthodox Marxist, he began to divert from some of Marx's predictions about societal development; whereas Marx had believed that a &quot;bourgeoisie-democratic revolution&quot; of the middle-classes had to take place before a &quot;socialist revolution&quot; of the proletariat, Lenin believed that in Russia, the proletariat could overthrow the Tsarist regime without an intermediate revolution.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=238–239}}

===February Revolution and the July Days: 1917===

In February 1917, the [[February Revolution]] broke out in St. Petersburg – renamed [[Petrograd]] at the beginning of the First World War – as industrial workers went on strike over food shortages and deteriorating factory conditions. The unrest spread to other parts of Russia, and fearing that he would be violently overthrown, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated. The State Duma took over control of the country, establishing a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] and converting the Empire into a new [[Russian Republic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=136–138|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=253}} When Lenin learned of this from his base in Switzerland, he celebrated with other dissidents.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=254–255}} He decided to return to Russia to take charge of the Bolsheviks, but found that most passages into the country were blocked due to the ongoing conflict.

Considering the government to be just as imperialist as the Tsarist regime, he advocated immediate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, rule by [[Soviet (council)|soviet]]s, the nationalisation of industry and banks, and the state expropriation of land, all with the intention of establishing a proletariat government and pushing toward a socialist society.

The coup petered out before it reached Petrograd, although the events had allowed the Bolsheviks to return to the open political arena.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1pp=439–465|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=150–151|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=299|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=143–144|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=173}} Fearing a counter-revolution from right-wing forces hostile to socialism, the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries who dominated the Petrograd Soviet had been instrumental in pressurising the government to normalise relations with the Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Pipes|1990|p=465}} Both the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries had lost much popular support because of their affiliation with the Provisional Government and its unpopular continuation of the war.

===Organising the Soviet government: 1917–18===

[[File:Lenin reads Pravda Newspaper.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|Lenin in his office, 1918]]

The Provisional Government had planned for a Constituent Assembly to be elected in November 1917; against Lenin's objections, Sovnarkom agreed for the vote to take place as scheduled.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=314|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=317}} In the [[Russian Constituent Assembly election, 1917|constitutional election]], the Bolsheviks gained approximately a quarter of the vote, being defeated by the agrarian-focused Socialist Revolutionary Party.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=315|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=540–541|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=164|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=173|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5p=331|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=192}} Lenin argued that the election was not a fair reflection of the people's will, that the electorate had not had time to learn the Bolsheviks' political programme, and that the candidacy lists had been drawn up before the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] split from the Socialist Revolutionaries.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1p=176|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=331–332|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=156|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=192}} Nevertheless, the newly elected [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] convened in Petrograd in January 1918.{{sfn|Rice|1990|p=164}} Sovnarkom argued that it was counter-revolutionary because it sought to remove power from the soviets, but the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks denied this.{{sfn|Pipes|1990|pp=546–547}} The Bolsheviks presented the Assembly with a motion that would strip it of most of its legal powers; when the Assembly rejected the motion, Sovnarkom declared this as evidence of its counter-revolutionary nature and forcibly disbanded it.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1pp=552–553|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=165|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3pp=176–177|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=332, 336–337|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=192}}

Lenin rejected repeated calls – including from some Bolsheviks – to establish a coalition government with other socialist parties.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=158|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2pp=301–302|3a1=Rigby|3y=1979|3p=26|4a1=Leggett|4y=1981|4p=5|5a1=Pipes|5y=1990|5pp=508, 519|6a1=Service|6y=2000|6pp=318–319|7a1=Read|7y=2005|7pp=189–190}} However, Sovnarkom partially relented; although refusing a coalition with the Mensheviks or Socialist Revolutionaries, in December 1917 they allowed the Left Socialist Revolutionaries five posts in the cabinet. This coalition only lasted four months, until March 1918, when the Left Socialist Revolutionaries pulled out of the government over a disagreement about the Bolsheviks' approach to ending the First World War.{{sfnm|1a1=Rigby|1y=1979|1pp=166–167|2a1=Leggett|2y=1981|2pp=20–21|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3pp=533–534, 537|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=171|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5pp=322–323|6a1=White|6y=2001|6p=159|7a1=Read|7y=2005|7p=191}} At their [[7th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|7th Congress]] in March 1918, the Bolsheviks changed their official name from the &quot;Russian Social Democratic Labour Party&quot; to the &quot;Russian Communist Party&quot;, as Lenin wanted to both distance his group from the increasingly reformist German Social Democratic Party and to emphasise its ultimate goal: a communist society.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=219, 256, 379|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=374|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=355|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=159|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=219}}

Although ultimate power officially rested with the country's government in the form of Sovnarkom and the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee|Executive Committee]] (VTSIK) elected by the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] (ARCS), the Communist Party was ''de facto'' in control in Russia, as acknowledged by its members at the time.{{sfnm|1a1=Rigby|1y=1979|1pp=160–164|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2pp=374–375|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=377}} By 1918, Sovnarkom began acting unilaterally, claiming a need for expediency, with the ARCS and VTSIK becoming increasingly marginalised,{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=74|2a1=Rigby|2y=1979|2pp=168–169}} so the soviets no longer had a role in governing Russia.{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=432}} During 1918 and 1919, the government expelled Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from the soviets.{{sfnm|1a1=Leggett|1y=1981|1p=316|2a1=Lee|2y=2003|2pp=98–99}} Russia had become a [[one-party state]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rigby|1y=1979|1pp=160–161|2a1=Leggett|2y=1981|2p=21|3a1=Lee|3y=2003|3p=99}}

Within the party was established a [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Political Bureau]] (&quot;Politburo&quot;) and [[Orgburo|Organisation Bureau]] (&quot;Orgburo&quot;) to accompany the existing [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]]; the decisions of these party bodies had to be adopted by Sovnarkom and the [[Council of Labor and Defense|Council of Labour and Defence]].{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=388|2a1=Lee|2y=2003|2p=98}} Lenin was the most significant figure in this governance structure; as well as being the Chairman of Sovnarkom and sitting on the Council of Labour and Defence, he was on the Central Committee and Politburo of the Communist Party.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=388}} The only individual to have anywhere near this influence was Lenin's right-hand man, [[Yakov Sverdlov]], who died in March 1919 during a [[1918 flu pandemic|flu pandemic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rigby|1y=1979|1pp=168, 170|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=388}} In November 1917, Lenin and his wife took a two-room flat within the Smolny Institute, although the following month left for a brief holiday in Halia, Finland.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=325–326, 333|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=211–212}} In January 1918, he survived an assassination attempt in Petrograd; [[Fritz Platten]], who was with Lenin at the time, shielded him and was injured by a bullet.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=361|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=548|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=229|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=335–336|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=198}}

Upon taking power, Lenin's regime issued a series of decrees. The first was a [[Decree on Land]], which declared that the [[landed estate]]s of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments. This contrasted with Lenin's desire for [[Collective farming|agricultural collectivisation]] but provided governmental recognition of the widespread peasant land seizures that had already occurred.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=252–253|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=499|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=341|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=316–317|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=149|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6pp=194–195}} In November 1917, the government issued the Decree on the Press that closed many opposition media outlets deemed counter-revolutionary.

In January and again in February, Lenin urged the Bolsheviks to accept Germany's proposals.

A decree in April 1919 resulted in the establishment of [[Internment|concentration camps]], which were entrusted to the Cheka,{{sfnm|1a1=Leggett|1y=1981|1pp=176–177|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=832, 834}} although they were later administered by a new government agency, [[Gulag]].{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1p=835|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=235}} By the end of 1920, 84 camps had been established across Soviet Russia, holding about 50,000 prisoners; by October 1923, this had grown to 315 camps and about 70,000 inmates.{{sfnm|1a1=Leggett|1y=1981|1p=178|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=836}} Those interned in the camps were used as [[slave labour]].{{sfnm|1a1=Leggett|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=832–833}} From July 1922, intellectuals deemed to be opposing the Bolshevik government were exiled to inhospitable regions or deported from Russia altogether; Lenin personally scrutinised the lists of those to be dealt with in this manner.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1pp=358–360|2a1=Ryan|2y=2012|2pp=172–173, 175–176}} In May 1922, Lenin issued a decree calling for the execution of anti-Bolshevik priests, causing between 14,000 and 20,000 deaths.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1pp=376–377|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=239|3a1=Ryan|3y=2012|3p=179}} Although the Russian Orthodox Church was worst affected, the government's anti-religious policies also impacted on [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] churches, [[Jewish]] synagogues, and [[Islamic]] mosques.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=381}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The existence of the Soviet Republic alongside the imperialist states over the long run is unthinkable. In the end, either the one or the other will triumph.

Although Lenin expected Russia's aristocracy and bourgeoisie to oppose his government, he believed that the numerical superiority of the lower classes, coupled with the Bolsheviks' ability to effectively organise them, guaranteed a swift victory in any conflict.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=357}} In this, he failed to anticipate the intensity of the violent opposition to Bolshevik rule in Russia.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=357}} The ensuing [[Russian Civil War]] pitted the pro-Bolshevik Reds against the anti-Bolshevik [[White movement|Whites]], but also encompassed ethnic conflicts on Russia's borders and conflict between both Red and White armies and local peasant groups, the [[Green armies]], throughout the former Empire.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=391–392}} Accordingly, various historians have seen the civil war as representing two distinct conflicts: one between the revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries, and the other between different revolutionary factions.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=84, 88}}

The White armies were established by former Tsarist military officers,{{sfn|Read|2005|p=205}} and included [[Anton Denikin]]'s [[Volunteer Army]] in [[South Russia (1919–1920)|South Russia]],{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=355|2a1=Leggett|2y=1981|2p=204|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3pp=173, 175|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=198|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5pp=357, 382|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=187}} [[Alexander Kolchak]]'s forces in Siberia,{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=334, 343, 357|2a1=Leggett|2y=1981|2p=204|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=382, 392|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4pp=205–206}} and [[Nikolai Yudenich]]'s troops in the newly independent Baltic states.{{sfnm|1a1=Leggett|1y=1981|1p=204|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=206}} The Whites were bolstered when 35,000 members of the [[Czechoslovak Legion|Czech Legion]] – [[prisoners of war]] from the conflict with the Central Powers – turned against Sovnarkom and allied with the [[Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly]] (Komuch), an anti-Bolshevik government established in Samara.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=288–289|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=624–630|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=360|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=161–162|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=205}} The Whites were also backed by Western governments who perceived the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a betrayal of the Allied war effort and feared the Bolsheviks' calls for world revolution.{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=262–263}} In 1918, the United Kingdom, France, United States, Canada, Italy, and Serbia landed 10,000 troops in [[Murmansk]], seizing [[Kandalaksha]], while later that year British, American, and Japanese forces landed in [[Vladivostok]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=291|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=354}} Western troops soon pulled out of the civil war, instead only supporting the Whites with officers, technicians and armaments, but Japan remained because they saw the conflict as an opportunity for territorial expansion.{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=331, 333}}

Lenin tasked Trotsky with establishing a [[Red Army|Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]], and with his support, Trotsky organised a [[Revolutionary Military Council]] in September 1918, remaining its chairman until 1925.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1pp=610, 612|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=198}} Recognising their valuable military experience, Lenin agreed that officers from the old Tsarist army could serve in the Red Army, although Trotsky established military councils to monitor their activities.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=337|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=609, 612, 629|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=198|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=383|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=217}} The Reds held control of Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and Petrograd, as well as most of [[Great Russia]], while the Whites were located largely on the former Empire's peripheries.{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=248, 262}} The latter were therefore hindered by being both fragmented and geographically scattered,{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1p=651|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=200|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=162|4a1=Lee|4y=2003|4p=81}} and because their ethnic Russian supremacism alienated the region's national minorities.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=251|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=163|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=220}} Anti-Bolshevik armies carried out the [[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]], a campaign of violence against perceived Bolshevik supporters, although this was typically more spontaneous than the state-sanctioned Red Terror.{{sfnm|1a1=Leggett|1y=1981|1p=201|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=792|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3pp=202–203|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=250}} Both White and Red Armies were responsible for attacks against Jewish communities, prompting Lenin to issue a condemnation of [[anti-Semitism]], which he blamed on capitalist propaganda.{{sfnm|1a1=Leggett|1y=1981|1p=201|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2pp=203–204}}

In July 1918, Sverdlov informed Sovnarkom that the Ural Regional Soviet had overseen the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of the former Tsar and his immediate family]] in [[Yekaterinburg]] to prevent them from being rescued by advancing White troops.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1pp=357–358|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=781–782|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3pp=206–207|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=364–365}} Although lacking proof, biographers and historians like [[Richard Pipes]] and [[Dmitri Volkogonov]] have expressed the view that the killing was probably sanctioned by Lenin;{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1pp=763, 770–771|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=211}} conversely, historian James Ryan cautioned that there was &quot;no reason&quot; to believe this.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=109}} For Lenin, however, the killing was necessary; he highlighted the precedent set by the [[execution of Louis XVI]] in the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=208}}

After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had abandoned the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution.{{sfn|Pipes|1990|p=635}} In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary [[Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin]] assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, [[Wilhelm von Mirbach]], hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident would lead to a relaunched revolutionary war against Germany.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=244|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=355|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3pp=636–640|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=360–361|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=159|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=199}} The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then [[Left SR uprising|launched a coup in Moscow]], shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=242|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=642–644|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=250}} The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=244|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=644|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=172}}

By 1919, the White armies were in retreat and by the start of 1920 they were defeated on all three fronts.{{sfnm|1a1=Leggett|1y=1981|1p=184|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=402|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=206}} However, the [[Polish–Soviet War]] broke out that year, after Poland tried to annex parts of [[Belarus]] and [[Western Ukraine]]; by May 1920 it had captured [[Kiev]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=389|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=182|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=281|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=407|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=161}} After forcing the Polish Army back, Lenin urged the Red Army to push into Poland itself, believing that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support the Russian troops and thus spark European revolution. Although Trotsky and other Bolsheviks were sceptical, they eventually agreed to the invasion. However, the Polish proletariat did not rise up, and the Red Army was defeated at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=391–395|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=396|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3pp=182–183|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=408–409, 412|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=161}} The Polish armies began to push the Red Army back into Russia, forcing Sovnarkom to sue for peace; the war culminated in the [[Peace of Riga]], in which Russia ceded territory to Poland and paid it reparations.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=183|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=388|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=412}}

After the Armistice on the Western Front, Lenin believed that the breakout of European revolution was imminent.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=387|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=173}} Seeking to promote this, Sovnarkom supported the establishment of [[Béla Kun]]'s [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Communist government in Hungary]] in March 1919, followed by the [[Bavarian Council Republic|Communist government in Bavaria]] and [[Revolutions of 1917–23|various revolutionary socialist uprisings]] in other parts of Germany, including [[Spartacist uprising|that of the Spartacus League]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=333|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=388|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=173|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=395}} During Russia's Civil War, the Red Army was sent into the newly independent national republics on Russia's borders to aid Marxists there in establishing soviet systems of government.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=385–386}} In Europe, this resulted in the creation of new Communist-led states in [[Commune of the Working People of Estonia|Estonia]], [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic|Latvia]], [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1918–19)|Lithuania]], [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia|Belarus]], and [[Ukrainian Soviet Republic|Ukraine]], all of which were officially independent of Russia,{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=385–386}} while further east it led to the creation of Communist governments in [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]], and then in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Outer Mongolia]].{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=531, 536}} Various senior Bolsheviks wanted these absorbed into the Russian state; Lenin insisted that national sensibilities should be respected, but reassured them that these nations' new Communist Party administrations were ''de facto'' regional branches of Moscow's government.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=386}}

In late 1918, the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] called for the establishment of an international conference of socialist parties, the [[Labour and Socialist International]].{{sfn|Shub|1966|pp=389–390}} Lenin saw this as a revival of the Second International, which he had despised, and formulated his own rival international conference of socialists to offset its impact.{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=390}} He organised this conference with the aid of Zinoviev, Trotsky, [[Christian Rakovsky]], and [[Angelica Balabanoff]].{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=390}} In March 1919, the First Congress of this [[Communist International]] (&quot;Comintern&quot;) opened in Moscow.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=525|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=390|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=174|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=390|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5p=386|6a1=White|6y=2001|6p=160|7a1=Read|7y=2005|7p=225}} It lacked global coverage; of the 34 assembled delegates, 30 resided within the countries of the former Russian Empire, and most of the international delegates were not officially recognised by the socialist parties within their own nations.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=525|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2pp=390–391|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=174|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=386|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=160}} Accordingly, the Bolsheviks dominated proceedings,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=387|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=160}} with Lenin subsequently authoring a series of regulations that meant that only socialist parties that endorsed the Bolsheviks' views were permitted to join Comintern.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=525|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=398|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=225–226}} During the first conference, Lenin spoke to the delegates, lambasting the parliamentary path to socialism espoused by revisionist Marxists like Kautsky and repeating his calls for a violent overthrow of Europe's bourgeoisie governments.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=387}} While Zinoviev became the International's President, Lenin continued to wield great control over it.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=395|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=391}}

The Second Congress of the Communist International opened in Petrograd's Smolny Institute in June 1920, representing the last time that Lenin visited a city other than Moscow.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=397|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=409}} There, he encouraged foreign delegates to emulate the Bolsheviks' seizure of power, and abandoned his longstanding viewpoint that capitalism was a necessary stage in societal development, instead encouraging those nations under colonial occupation to transform their pre-capitalist societies directly into socialist ones.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=409–410}} For this conference, he authored ''[[&quot;Left-Wing&quot; Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'', a short book articulating his criticism of far-left elements within the British and German communist parties who refused to enter those nations' parliamentary systems and trade unions; instead he urged them to do so to advance the revolutionary cause.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=415–420|2a1=White|2y=2001|2pp=161, 180–181}} The conference had to be suspended for several days due to the ongoing war with Poland,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=410}} before the Congress subsequently moved to Moscow, where it continued to hold sessions until August.{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=397}} However, Lenin's predicted world revolution did not materialise, as the Hungarian Communist government was overthrown and the German Marxist uprisings suppressed.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=341|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=396|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=174}}

===Famine and the New Economic Policy: 1920–22===

Within the Communist Party, there was dissent from two factions, the [[Group of Democratic Centralism]] and the [[Workers' Opposition]], both of which accused the Russian state of being too centralised and bureaucratic.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=437–438|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=406|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=183|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=419|5a1=White|5y=2001|5pp=167–168}} The Workers' Opposition, which had connections to the official state trade unions, also expressed the concern that the government had lost the trust of the Russian working class.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=406|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=419|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=167}} They were angered by Trotsky's suggestion that the trade unions be eliminated.

Despite his illness, Lenin remained keenly interested in political developments.

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=We do not pretend that Marx or Marxists know the road to socialism in all its concreteness. That is nonsense. We know the direction of the road, we know what class forces will lead it, but concretely, practically, this will be shown by ''the experience of the millions'' when they undertake the act.|source=Lenin, 11 September 1917{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=150}} }}

Lenin was a fervent believer in Marxism,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} and believed that his interpretation of Marxism – first termed &quot;Leninism&quot; by Martov in 1904{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=409}} – was the sole authentic and orthodox one.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=35|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=237}} According to his Marxist perspective, humanity would eventually reach pure communism, becoming a stateless, classless, egalitarian society of workers who were free from [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], controlled their own destiny, and abided by the rule &quot;[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]&quot;.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} According to Volkogonov, Lenin &quot;deeply and sincerely&quot; believed that the path he was setting Russia on would ultimately lead to the establishment of this communist society.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=206}}

However, Lenin's Marxist beliefs led him to the view that society could not transform directly from its present state to communism, but must first enter a period of socialism, and so his main concern was how to convert Russia into a socialist society. To do so, he believed that a dictatorship of the proletariat was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a socialist economy.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=35}} He defined socialism as &quot;an order of civilized co-operators in which the [[means of production]] are socially owned&quot;,{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=432}} and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until it could create a [[Post-scarcity economy|society of abundance]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} To achieve this, he saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be his central concern, with – in his words – &quot;all citizens&quot; becoming &quot;hired employees of the state&quot;.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=42–43}} Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and [[statism|statist]], with both production and distribution strictly controlled.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} He believed that all workers throughout the country would voluntarily join together to enable the state's economic and political centralisation.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=38}} In this way, his calls for &quot;workers' control&quot; of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by their workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a &quot;workers' state&quot;.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=43–44, 63}} This resulted in two conflicting themes within Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=36}}

[[File:Lenin 1919-03-18.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|Lenin speaking in 1919]]

Before 1914, Lenin mostly agreed with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} However, Leninism introduced revisions and innovations to orthodox Marxism, and adopted a more absolutist, doctrinaire perspective.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} Similarly, Leninism distinguished itself from established variants of Marxism by the emotional intensity of its [[Emancipation|liberationist]] vision and its focus on the leadership role of a revolutionary vanguard proletariat.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} Thus, Lenin came to deviate from the Marxist mainstream over the issue of how to establish a proletarian state; his belief in a strong state apparatus that excluded the bourgeois conflicted with the views of European Marxists like Kautsky who envisioned a democratic parliamentary government in which the proletariat had a majority.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} Moreover, according to historian James Ryan, Lenin was &quot;the first and most significant Marxist theorist to dramatically elevate the role of violence as revolutionary instrument&quot;.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=3}} Lenin incorporated changing circumstances into his belief system,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=13}} and the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse resulted in him deviating from many of the Marxist ideas he had articulated before the October Revolution.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=57|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=151}}

Lenin's ideas were heavily influenced both by pre-existing thought within the Russian revolutionary movement, and by theoretical variants of Russian Marxism, which had focused heavily on how Marx and Engels' writings would apply to Russia.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=29|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=1}} Accordingly, Lenin was also influenced by earlier currents of Russian socialist thought such as those of the Narodnik agrarian-socialists.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=173}} Conversely, he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=203}} In his theoretical writings, particularly ''Imperialism'', he examined what he thought were the developments in capitalism since Marx's death, arguing that it had reached a new stage, [[state monopoly capitalism]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=34}} Before taking power in 1917, he believed that while Russia's economy was still dominated by the peasantry, the fact that monopoly capitalism existed in Russia meant that the country was sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism.{{sfn|White|2001|pp=150–151}}

Lenin was an [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] and a keen supporter of [[world revolution]], deeming national borders to be an outdated concept and nationalism a distraction from class struggle.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=54|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=423|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3p=352}} He believed that under revolutionary socialism, there would be &quot;the inevitable merging of nations&quot; and the ultimate establishment of &quot;[[world government|a United States of the World]]&quot;.{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=88–89}} He opposed [[federalism]], deeming it to be bourgeois, and instead emphasised the need for a centralised [[unitary state]].{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=87}} Lenin was [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], and believed that all nations deserved &quot;the right of self-determination&quot;.{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=87}} He thus supported [[war of national liberation|wars of national liberation]], accepting that such conflicts might be necessary for a minority group to break away from a [[socialist state]], because socialist states are not &quot;holy or insured against mistakes or weaknesses&quot;.{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=91, 93}}

He expressed the view that &quot;Soviet government is many millions of times more democratic than the most democratic-bourgeois republic&quot;, the latter of which was simply &quot;a democracy for the rich&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=310|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=442}} He deemed his &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; to be democratic through the election of representatives to the soviets, and by workers electing their own officials, with regular rotation and involvement of all workers in the administration of the country.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=36–37}} Lenin believed that the [[representative democracy]] of capitalist countries had been used to give the illusion of democracy while maintaining the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; describing the representative democratic system of the United States, he referred to the &quot;spectacular and meaningless duels between two bourgeois parties&quot;, both of whom were led by &quot;astute multimillionaires&quot; that exploited the American proletariat.{{sfn|Rice|1990|p=121}} He also opposed liberalism, exhibiting a general antipathy toward [[liberty]] as a value,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=471}} and believing that liberalism's freedoms were fraudulent because it did not free labourers from capitalist exploitation.{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=443}}

==Personal life and characteristics==

Lenin saw himself as a man of destiny, and firmly believed in the righteousness of his cause and his own ability as a revolutionary leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1pp=159, 202|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=207}} Biographer [[Louis Fischer]] described him as &quot;a lover of radical change and maximum upheaval&quot;, a man for whom &quot;there was never a middle-ground.

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=|quote=[Lenin's collected writings] reveal in detail a man with iron will, self-enslaving self-discipline, scorn for opponents and obstacles, the cold determination of a zealot, the drive of a fanatic, and the ability to convince or browbeat weaker persons by his singleness of purpose, imposing intensity, impersonal approach, personal sacrifice, political astuteness, and complete conviction of the possession of the absolute truth.

Historian and biographer [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] asserted that Lenin had been an intensely emotional young man,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=73}} who exhibited strong hatred for the Tsarist authorities.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=44|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=81}} According to Service, Lenin developed an &quot;emotional attachment&quot; to his ideological heroes, such as Marx, Engels and Chernyshevsky; he owned portraits of them,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=118}} and privately described himself as being &quot;in love&quot; with Marx and Engels.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=232|2a1=Lih|2y=2011|2p=13}} According to Lenin biographer James D.

The historian [[Albert Resis]] suggested that if the October Revolution is considered the most significant event of the 20th century, then Lenin &quot;must for good or ill be considered the century's most significant political leader&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Vladimir Ilich Lenin |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |author=Albert Resis |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/335881/Vladimir-Ilich-Lenin |accessdate=4 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619112253/http://www.britannica.com/biography/Vladimir-Ilich-Lenin |archivedate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; White described Lenin as &quot;one of the undeniably outstanding figures of modern history&quot;,{{sfn|White|2001|p=iix}} while Service noted that the Russian leader was widely understood to be one of the 20th century's &quot;principal actors&quot;.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=488}} Read considered him &quot;one of the most widespread, universally recognizable icons of the twentieth century&quot;,{{sfn|Read|2005|p=283}} while Ryan called him &quot;one of the most significant and influential figures of modern history&quot;.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=5}} ''Time'' magazine named Lenin one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most important people of the 20th century]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME 100: Vladimir Lenin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://205.188.238.181/time/time100/leaders/profile/lenin.html |title=TIME 100: Vladimir Lenin |author=David Remnick |date=13 April 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425120012/http://205.188.238.181/time/time100/leaders/profile/lenin.html |archivedate=25 April 2011 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of their top 25 political icons of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 25 Political Icons: Lenin&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2046096,00.html |title=Top 25 Political Icons: Lenin |author=Feifei Sun |website=Time |date=4 February 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114032814/http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2046096,00.html |archivedate=14 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western world, biographers began writing about Lenin soon after his death; some – like [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] – were sympathetic to him, and others – like Richard Pipes and [[Robert Gellately]] – expressly hostile. A number of later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes.{{sfnm|1a1=Lee|1y=2003|1p=14|2a1=Ryan|2y=2012|2p=3}} Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=14}} The Soviet view characterised him as a man who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=123}} Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him as a person who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=123}} More recently, [[Historical revisionism|revisionists]] in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=124}}

Various historians and biographers have characterised Lenin's administration as [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]],{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=516|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=415|3a1=Leggett|3y=1981|3p=364|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4pp=307, 312}} and as a [[police state]],{{sfn|Leggett|1981|p=364}} and many have described it as a one-party dictatorship.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewin|1y=1969|1p=12|2a1=Rigby|2y=1979|2pp=x, 161|3a1=Sandle|3y=1999|3p=164|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=506|5a1=Lee|5y=2003|5p=97|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=190|7a1=Ryan|7y=2012|7p=9}} Several such scholars have described Lenin as a dictator,{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=417|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=416|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3p=511|4a1=Pipes|4y=1996|4p=3|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=247}} although Ryan stated that he was &quot;not a dictator in the sense that all his recommendations were accepted and implemented&quot;, for many of his colleagues disagreed with him on various issues.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=1}} Fischer noted that while &quot;Lenin was a dictator, [he was] not the kind of dictator Stalin later became&quot;,{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=524}} while Volkogonov believed that whereas Lenin established a &quot;dictatorship of the Party&quot;, it would only be under Stalin that the Soviet Union became the &quot;dictatorship of one man&quot;.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=313}} 

Conversely, various Marxist observers – including Western historians Hill and [[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]] – argued against the view that Lenin's government was a dictatorship, viewing it instead as an imperfect way of preserving elements of democracy without some of the processes found in liberal democratic states.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=120}} Ryan contends that the leftist historian [[Paul Le Blanc]] &quot;makes a quite valid point that the personal qualities that led Lenin to brutal policies were not necessarily any stronger than in some of the major Western leaders of the twentieth century&quot;.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=191}} Historian [[J. Arch Getty]] remarked, &quot;Lenin deserves a lot of credit for the notion that the meek can inherit the earth, that there can be a political movement based on [[social justice]] and equality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Vladimir Lenin Biography |episode-link= |url=http://www.biography.com/people/vladimir-lenin-9379007|access-date= 20 May 2016|series= Biography|series-link= |first= |last= |network= A&amp;E Television Networks|station= |date= |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= 42:10|time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some left-wing intellectuals, among them [[Slavoj Žižek]], [[Alain Badiou]], Lars T.

===Within the Soviet Union===
[[File:Russia-2007-Moscow-Kremlin Senate at night.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|Lenin's Mausoleum, in front of the Kremlin, in 2007]]

In the Soviet Union, a cult of personality devoted to Lenin began to develop during his lifetime, but was only fully established after his death.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1p=327|2a1=Tumarkin|2y=1997|2p=2|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=185|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=260}} According to historian Nina Tumarkin, it represented the world's &quot;most elaborate cult of a revolutionary leader&quot; since that of [[George Washington]] in the United States,{{sfn|Tumarkin|1997|p=2}} and has been repeatedly described as &quot;quasi-religious&quot; in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1p=814|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=485|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=185|4a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|4y=2010|4p=114|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=284}} Busts or statues of Lenin were erected in almost every village,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=328}} and his face adorned postage stamps, crockery, posters, and the front pages of Soviet newspapers ''Pravda'' and ''[[Isvestia]]''.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=486}} The places where he had lived or stayed were converted into museums devoted to him.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=328}} Libraries, streets, farms, museums, towns, and whole regions were named after him,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=328}} with the city of Petrograd being renamed &quot;Leningrad&quot; in 1924,{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1p=437|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=482}} and his birthplace of Simbirsk becoming &quot;Ulyanovsk&quot;.{{sfn|Lih|2011|p=22}} The [[Order of Lenin]] was established as one of the country's highest decorations.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=486}} All of this was contrary to Lenin's own desires, and was publicly criticised by his widow.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=440}}

Various biographers have stated that Lenin's writings were treated in a manner akin to [[holy scripture]] within the Soviet Union,{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=439|2a1=Pipes|2y=1996|2p=1|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=482}} while Pipes added that &quot;his every opinion was cited to justify one policy or another and treated as gospel&quot;.{{sfn|Pipes|1996|p=1}} Stalin codified Leninism through a series of lectures at the [[Sverdlov University]], which were then published as ''Questions of Leninism''.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=484|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=185|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=260, 284}} Stalin also had much of the deceased leader's writings collated and stored in a secret archive in the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|pp=274–275}} Material, such as Lenin's collection of books in Kraków, were also collected from abroad for storage in the Institute, often at great expense.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=262}} During the Soviet era, these writings were strictly controlled and very few had access.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=261}} All of Lenin's writings that proved useful to Stalin were published, but the others remained hidden,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=263}} and knowledge of both Lenin's non-Russian ancestry and his noble status was suppressed.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=486}} In particular, his Jewish ancestry was suppressed until the 1980s,{{sfnm|1a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|1y=2010|1p=99|2a1=Lih|2y=2011|2p=20}} perhaps out of Soviet anti-Semitism,{{sfn|Read|2005|p=6}} and so as not to undermine Stalin's Russification efforts,{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|p=108}} and perhaps so as not to provide fuel for anti-Soviet sentiment among international anti-semites.{{sfn|Read|2005|p=6}} Under Stalin's regime, Lenin was actively portrayed as a close friend of Stalin's who had supported Stalin's bid to be the next Soviet leader.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=485}} During the Soviet era, five separate editions of Lenin's published works were published in Russian, the first beginning in 1920 and the last from 1958 to 1965; although the fifth edition was described as &quot;complete&quot;, in reality it had much omitted for political expediency.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1996|1pp=1–2|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=183}}

[[File:URSS 1 rublo centenario nascita Lenin.JPG|Commemorative [[Soviet rouble|one rouble]] coin minted in 1970 in honour of Lenin's centenary|thumb|upright=1.2|left]]

After Stalin's death, [[Nikita Khruschev]] became leader of the Soviet Union and began a process of [[de-Stalinization|de-Stalinisation]], citing Lenin's writings, including those on Stalin, to legitimise this process.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1pp=452–453|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=491–492|3a1=Lee|3y=2003|3p=131}} When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] took power in 1985 and introduced the policies of ''[[glastnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'', he too cited these actions as a return to Lenin's principles.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=491–492}} In late 1991, amid the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] ordered the Lenin archive be removed from Communist Party control and placed under the control of a state organ, the [[Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History]], at which it was revealed that over 6,000 of Lenin's writings had gone unpublished. These were declassified and made available for scholarly study.{{sfn|Pipes|1996|pp=2–3}} Yeltsin did not dismantle the Lenin mausoleum, however, recognising that Lenin was too popular and well respected among the Russian populace for this to be viable.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=492}}

In Russia in 2012, a proposal from the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]], with the support of some members of the governing [[United Russia]] party, proposed the removal of all Lenin monuments, a proposal strongly opposed by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/politics/lenin-monuments-removed-squares-131/ |title=All monuments of Lenin to be removed from Russian cities |website=RT |date=20 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117063200/https://www.rt.com/politics/lenin-monuments-removed-squares-131/ |archivedate=17 November 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ukraine, during the 2013–14 [[Euromaidan]] protests, several Lenin statues were [[List of heritage damaged during Euromaidan|damaged or destroyed]] by protesters who viewed them as a symbol of Russian imperialism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ukraine crisis: Lenin statues toppled in protest |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26306737 |website=BBC News |date=22 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123905/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26306737 |archivedate=5 January 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2015 the Ukrainian government ordered that all others be dismantled to comply with [[Decommunization in Ukraine|decommunisation laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32267075 |title=Goodbye, Lenin: Ukraine moves to ban communist symbols |website=BBC News |date=14 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307200441/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32267075 |archivedate=7 March 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of Lenin's Jewish ancestry, this aspect was repeatedly emphasised by the Russian far right, who claimed that his inherited Jewish genetics explained his desire to uproot traditional Russian society.{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|pp=134, 159–161}}

===In the international communist movement===

According to Lenin biographer [[David Shub]], writing in 1965, it was Lenin's ideas and example that &quot;constitutes the basis of the Communist movement today&quot;.{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=10}} Communist regimes professing allegiance to Lenin's ideas appeared in various parts of the world during the 20th century.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=5}}

After Lenin's death, Stalin's administration established an ideology known as [[Marxism-Leninism]], a movement that came to be interpreted differently by various contending factions in the Communist movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=9|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=482}} After being forced into exile by Stalin's administration, Trotsky argued that Stalinism was a debasement of Leninism, which was dominated by bureaucratism and Stalin's own personal dictatorship.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=132}} Marxism-Leninism would be adapted to many of the 20th century's most prominent revolutionary movements, forming into variants such as [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], [[Juche]], [[Ho Chi Minh Thought]], and [[Castroism]].{{sfn|Read|2005|p=283}} Conversely, many later Western communists such as [[Manuel Azcárate]] and Jean Ellenstein who were involved in the [[Eurocommunism|Eurocommunist]] movement expressed the view that Lenin and his ideas were irrelevant to their own objectives, thereby embracing a Marxist but not Marxist-Leninist perspective.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=132–133}}
