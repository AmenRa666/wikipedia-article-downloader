==Start==

Looks like a good start.  It needs references.  Is there much detail left to add?  -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] 02:53, 30 June 2007 (UTC)

:I have a reference book that has details on the avionics upgrade, etc, that I will try to add some more details from. Most of what I have there now was culled from the A-4 and RSAF articles, and all of that was unreferenced. It's an interesting variant, as far as I know the only A-4s upgraded with the F404 engine. - [[User:BillCJ|BillCJ]] 03:14, 30 June 2007 (UTC)
:* Yea, fact tags a plenty at the moment.  The Skyhawk.org site has a RSAF page I added to the EL.  But that won't be as good as a reference book.  -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] 04:55, 30 June 2007 (UTC)

==Into this fire I came==
Okay, things look pretty good now for the article after I had made so much addition and new images. Let me know if any more improvement is required. --[[User:Dave1185|Dave1185]] ([[User talk:Dave1185|talk]]) 01:46, 30 May 2008 (UTC)
: Articles are never done. Did the last 4 from the Advanced Jet Training Program get retired last year?  -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 01:21, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
:*Well, as much I can tell there are no news of them retiring yet but it is slated for somewhere before January 2010 so I'm just waiting for the PR boys to make their press release next year. Cheers! --[[User:Dave1185|Dave1185]] ([[User talk:Dave1185|talk]]) 18:52, 30 July 2008 (UTC)
::*Plus, I'm paying a lot attention to [[T-50 Golden Eagle]] now since it might become the successor to A-4SU and that will determine when that last 4 might be retired. --''[[User:Dave1185|Dave1185]] ([[User talk:Dave1185|talk]]) 07:09, 5 June 2009 (UTC)''
{{od}}
*Well, for the interested... this photo ([[:File:RSAF A-4SU Super Skyhawks at Istres Air Base.jpg]]) taken last year shows that the super scooter is still scooting around. Best and out. --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Dave1185|&lt;font face=&quot;Rage Italic&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;color:#000000;color:green&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dave&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Italic;color:black&quot;&gt;[[user_talk:Dave1185|♠♣♥♦™№1185©♪♫®]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 19:37, 2 June 2011 (UTC)

==First Flight==
The infobox has a FF of 19 Sep 1986 but didnt the first SU not fly until 1992. Perhaps it should be made clearer that the 1986 was for the earlier ''Super Skyhawk'' updates. [[User:MilborneOne|MilborneOne]] ([[User talk:MilborneOne|talk]]) 20:25, 21 June 2009 (UTC)
:Mill, the FF of the SU was indeed conducted on 19 Sep 1986 but it was only to test the newly transplanted heart → the GE-F404 turbofan engine, it took a while longer (much, much longer because it was essentially a total rebuild conducted by our local fledgling aerospace company, Singapore Aerospace) to iron out the kinks, the wings and fuselage integrity as well as integrate the new avionic package into the airframe. Note that there hasn't been much of any accident since due to the this thorough re-manufacturing process, as pretty much most of the airframes survive until they were phased out of front-line service in 2005 when they were nearing the end of their fuselage life. Hope this helps. --''[[User:Dave1185|Dave1185]] ([[User talk:Dave1185|talk]]) 20:37, 21 June 2009 (UTC)''

== Cockpit comparison ==

I don't believe the &quot;cockpit comparison&quot; images of the SR-71B and TR-1B really add to the article - yes, they have a similiar, odd cockpit configuration, but then so does the MiG-25U. It's unusual, but saying &quot;see how these other aircraft have the same configuration&quot; really doesn't help, IMHO, especially with such a large, ungainly block being used to hold them. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] &lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 10:07, 11 February 2011 (UTC)

:*Read the edit history of the article and you'll see what I meant by that sentence and image placement. Too many newbie and ignorant editors just missed the point without realising it. Besides, ''MiG-25U was not built by Lockheed'' but TA-4S '''were''', same goes for '''Lockheed SR-71B''' and '''Lockheed TU-2S'''. Best. --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Dave1185|&lt;font face=&quot;Rage Italic&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;color:#000000;color:green&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dave&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Italic;color:black&quot;&gt;[[user_talk:Dave1185|♠♣♥♦™№1185©♪♫®]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 10:26, 11 February 2011 (UTC)

::*Ahh, that does make a bit more sense. Still wish there was a better way to display it though than that [[big box store|big box]]! - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] &lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 21:24, 11 February 2011 (UTC)

:::*Give me one ping, Vasilly, one ping only please. {{=)|grin}} --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Dave1185|&lt;font face=&quot;Rage Italic&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;color:#000000;color:green&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dave&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Italic;color:black&quot;&gt;[[user_talk:Dave1185|♠♣♥♦™№1185©♪♫®]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 02:13, 12 February 2011 (UTC)

I have to bring up the question raised by [[User:The Bushranger]] again. What do the photos of other aircraft with a similar cockpit arrangement add to the article that is solely about this specific aircraft? I understand the comparison, but I don't think it's relevant. For example, an article about the [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] doesn't show pictures of other aircraft that share its rare but not unique v-tail arrangement. [[Special:Contributions/153.31.113.20|153.31.113.20]] ([[User talk:153.31.113.20|talk]]) 18:19, 26 January 2012 (UTC)

:*Perhaps it'd be better if I reword it again to avoid further misunderstanding by newbies and ignorant editors? Any suggestion? --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Dave1185|&lt;font face=&quot;Rage Italic&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;color:#000000;color:green&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dave&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Italic;color:black&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Dave1185#top|♠♣♥♦™№1185©♪♫®]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 23:43, 26 January 2012 (UTC)

::* I don't believe the issue is one of wording, but one of relevance. [[Special:Contributions/153.31.113.20|153.31.113.20]] ([[User talk:153.31.113.20|talk]]) 16:30, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

:::*It is very relevant because purpose-built TA-4E/Fs by '''Douglas''' were tandem seaters, whereas TA-4S/SU converted from regular A-4B/Cs by Lockheed were similar to the other '''Lockheed'''-built trainers of SR-71B and TU-2S, which are all stepped-cockpit designs with separate canopy and seats for the student and instructor pilot. --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Dave1185|&lt;font face=&quot;Rage Italic&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;color:#000000;color:green&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dave&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Italic;color:black&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Dave1185#top|♠♣♥♦™№1185©♪♫®]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 20:06, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

::::* I understand the difference between the two designs by the two different manufacturers. I understand why that difference is relevant to the article. What is not relevant to the article, the scope of which is one specific aircraft, is pictures of other aircraft from the manufacturer in question just to show that that company has other aircraft with a similar design. On an article about bats you don't need a picture of birds as an example of other animals with wings. Or to put it in more closely related terms, a photo of a 707 would not be relevant on an article about the 727 just to show that they have the same nose cross-section. Either way it seems moot now.
