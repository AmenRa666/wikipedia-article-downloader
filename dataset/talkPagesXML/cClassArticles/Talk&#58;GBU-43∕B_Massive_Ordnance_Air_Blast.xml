==General Remarks By People Not Inclined To Use Their Own Heading==
The article lists the Royal Air Force as operators but also says that there were only 15 known to be produced and are all presumed to be in USAF the arsenal/storage. My cursory search couldn't find any connection to the RAF, could someone confirm the status of this and edit accordingly? The RAF does have the Hercules aircraft to deploy the weapon but that's about the only link I can find with the RAF and MOAB and that's tenuous at best as it's certainly nothing like what the RAF normally uses its c-130s for.  If it is accurate it is probably worth a mention in the article proper.   &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/115.64.190.234|115.64.190.234]] ([[User talk:115.64.190.234|talk]]) 08:34, 6 August 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Could we get a picture of the bomb with a size reference? Like a person standing next to it? I mean, the Grand Slam bomb was 22,000 pounds and actually hung out of the belly of the largest Allied bomber aircraft. This is 5 tons more than ''that''.

Can anyone explain the point of this page? The US DoD stuffs a bunch of ammonium nitrate in a big can, puts it on television, and it becomes worthy of an encyclopedia article? [[User:Wji|Wji]]

:Wji: I suppose the entries on [[monchhichi]]s and [[John Stevens (singer)]] (A 6th place finisher on the 3rd season of American Idol) have more legitimacy as entries than a multi-ton weapon developed by the military?

Guys! This is the MOTHER OF ALL BOMBS! The largest bomb in history that's not a nuke! It deserves an article.[[User:Philwelch|Philwelch]] 07:53, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::[[Grand Slam bomb]] is the largest combat tested as the arms salesmen like to point out when selling weapons.

Well I got rid of the second paragraph about the contrived acronym. Three things: a) I don't think it had anything to do with the issue at hand. b) I'm pretty sure the fact that Moab is also a region in (I think) Israel doesn't mean it was named because of that, I think everyone is pretty much sure the acronym means both 'Massive ordinance...' and/or 'Mother of...' but is not a reference to the region. c)We don't need an entire paragraph explaining something that is already stated in the first paragraph.

I hope '''OPSEC''' [http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/a021202b.html] is being considered here.  This is an ''open source''.


==MOAB use==

This article says the MOAB wasn't used in Iraq, what on earth caused those huge nuclearesque mushroom clouds over baghdad we all saw on the news during 'operation shock and awe'?  Everyone thought it was a nuke, then another went off, and another, all the size of small TNW's yet the media swiftly started calling them MOAB's.  [[User:Jachin|Jachin]] 20:41, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

*Those were perfectly ordinary everyday bombs, almost certainly 2,000 lbs or smaller. Almost any large explosion will cause a &quot;nuclearesque mushroom cloud&quot;. As for the media, I wouldn't trust them to be accurate on military matters. My all time favourite quote was from a news crew on a helicopter in Gulf War 1... an F-15 came to have a look at them and was described as &quot;an F-111 from a nearby carrier&quot;. [[User:BobThePirate|BobThePirate]] 11:30, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

**Yes they were used in Iraq.  Also, if you open Google Earth and look at MOTSU in Eastern North Carolina, you can see 3 of them about to be loaded on ship.  Here is the exact: 34° 0'38.95&quot;N 77°58'1.37&quot;W  Also, sligtly east there are 2 emtpy sleds.

== MOAB Power ==

It should be mentioned that a MOAB is IN NO WAY comparable to a nuclear weapon because:
a)It is a conventional weapon,
b)It has nowhere near as much power as a nuclear weapon (0.08 kilotons I believe, as opposed to the 10-12 kilotons of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs),
c)It does not have the same radioactive aftereffects.
Feel free to debate this, but I think that the number of confusing references to nuclear effects should be cleaned up. Any thoughts?
--[[User:The1exile|The1exile]] 20:32, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

:I think you meant kilotons, not megatons.

:With 9 tons of explosive that is 1.35 times as powerful as TNT, the MOAB should have a blast similar to 12 tons of TNT, or 0.012 kilotons.  Some of the smallest nuclear weapons (like the [[W54]] warhead) could be set as low as 10 tons, or 0.01 kilotons. [[User:Oralloy|Oralloy]] 14:04, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

Although, your rational seems plausible, think about it this way.  Take away the EMP, the radiation and the thermal wave, and what you have left is a MOAB (PRESSURE). [[User:70.125.43.99|70.125.43.99]] 20:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

== H6 Explosive ==

**You need to note that this is a Thermobaric Varient of H6.  There is also a slurry version that is classified.  H6 is a bastard child of [[RDX]] (Cyclotrimethylene trinitramine), 14 nanogram [[aluminum]] and [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (trinotoluene).  The TNT is a booster charge that spreads the aluminum talc airborn, mixing it with air (which happens to be about 1/3 [[oxygen]]).  When the 14 nano AL particles spread out, they start to rust and release [[hydrogen]] as the [[water]] binds to the particles.  This starts the increase of heat in the area.  The second charge then goes off that starts the aluminum talc burning in what is known as a [[pressure wave]].  This pressure wave is discribed here:  [[Thermobaric_weapons#Weapon_effects]] and here [[Nuclear_explosion#Blast_damage]]

:The [[Slurry]] version is just like the [[BLU-82]], only obviously bigger.  [[User:70.125.43.99|70.125.43.99]] 01:51, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

::H-6 is a specific composition.  If it were altered to be a thermobaric explosive, it would no longer be H-6.

::*right you are, that is why I called it a bastard of H-6.  It is a polymer-bonded explosive developed by Picatinny Arsenal, caled PAX.  I think it is either PAX-28 or PAX-40.  More info is here: http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/explosives-im.htm

:::Also, here is Pic's homepage:  http://www.pica.army.mil/PicatinnyPublic/index.asp

:::...Cheers
:::[[User:PETN|PETN]] 01:00, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

::::The PAX explosives are based on DNAN (dinitroanisole), which makes them melt-pour explosives instead of polymer-bonded explosives.

::::These explosives are described a bit in this patent: http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6648998.html

::::I wouldn't be surprised if we switched over to something like PAX-28 once the TNT ran out, but I haven't heard that this has happened yet. [[User:Oralloy|Oralloy]] 08:21, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

:::::Simply having aluminum in the explosive does not make it count as a thermobaric explosive.  Many explosives contain about 20% aluminum because it reacts with the large molecular fragments left just after the explosive detonation, adding to the energy of the bomb.

:::::A thermobaric explosive contains much larger quantities of aluminum (or other fuel) that continues to react with oxygen in the air where it is detonated.

:::::Note this page on thermobarics: http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/thermobaric.htm

:::::At the bottom they list three timescales for the explosion.  #1 is the actual detonation of the primary explosive.  #2 is the burning of the molecular fragments from the detonated explosive.  This is where the aluminum in explosives like H-6 come in.  And #3 is the timescale of the burning of the excess fuel in a thermobaric explosive. [[User:Oralloy|Oralloy]] 08:21, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

::Also, the aluminum in H-6 is not separate, but mixed in with the TNT and RDX.

::I am not sure what the advantage would be to filling the MOAB with a thermobaric explosive, since it was designed to be exploded aboveground.  Thermobarics work best in enclosed spaces.

::The reports of a slurry filled weapon originated when the bomb was first made, when reporters assumed it contained the same kind of explosive as the Daisy Cutter.  Using a slurry had an advantage with a fat bomb like the daisy cutter, since normal high explosive would form voids in it if it was cast in such a bomb.  I don't see how a slurry would be an advantage in a narrow bomb like the MOAB. [[User:Oralloy|Oralloy]] 20:57, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

I noticed that the wiki link for H-6 in this section refers to RDX, implying that it is a synonym. As noted here and elsewhere, H-6 is a mixture that includes RDX. --[[User:Morkilus|Morkilus]] 15:49, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

== couple problems with the article ==
# This munition is not particularly similar to the BLU-82 at all. It bears a passing resemblance, in that it is dropped from a cargo plane, and makes a big flash-bang-etc. However, the &quot;daisy cutter&quot; (and I think that term should be removed, as well) is a slurry, rather than a standard HE charge. Additionally, the BLU-82 is designed to drop nose-first, and detonate a few inches off the ground, thus clearing vegetation. The MOAB glides. That's why it has ''control surfaces''. If this is an antipersonnel weapon, the &quot;air blast&quot; name makes sense, as it would be extremely effective as an overpressure weapon (see [[thermobaric weapon]], above). 
# The &quot;pound for pound&quot; line is idiotic. Pound for pound, I'd go with the [[5.56 NATO]]. The article is biased in tone, and explicitly in several places.

== Weapons Effects ==

I see there is now a section called weapons effects, which claims that the MOAB is a thermobaric weapon that uses a slurry of ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminum.

It is neither such a slurry nor a thermobaric weapon.  (And thermobaric weapons are completely different than bombs that use a slurry of ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminum.)

I'm not sure if the section needs to be rewritten or deleted, but it certainly needs to be fixed. [[User:Oralloy|Oralloy]] 15:23, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

::It appears in [[Mercenaries 2]], as well, but I agree with Leushenko--popular culture references to weapons can be a slippery slope, unless it's something rather significat (ie: a movie about the wepon).

I for one like having separate sections on popular culture references to weapons (and on much else). They quite clearly are useful to people interested in popular culture (not my main interest, but a secondary interest). Moreover, I'm convinced that popular culture gets far more people to consult entries like this one than does high culture.

== Biggest Conventional Weapon Ever? ==

I think that the description of this as the biggest (most powerful) conventional weapon may actually be correct. The body of the article states that it contains 18,700 pounds of high explosive. The link given on the T12 page says that (at the very bottom, in section 10) that the T12 contains 17,600 pounds of high explosive. Therefore, reference to the T12 as more powerful should be changed, which I shall now do. [[User:Supersheep|Supersheep]] 17:01, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

:Still a little troublesome -- the T12 did half of its work (penetrating a hardened target) through sheer kinetic energy, at supersonic speeds.  I can't come up with a reasonable way to compare the two.--[[User:Parous|Parous]] 06:27, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

:: That is a fair point. Maybe a qualification, mentioning the penetration speed of the T-12? I'll have a look and try work it in. Nonetheless, explosive power is the qualification for most powerful weapon - we don't say that a Peacekeeper warhead is the most powerful nuke, even though it has the best penetration (that is, it's the best for silo-killing).

::: I can cite a source that states it is the &quot;most massive&quot; conventional bomb in the U.S. arsenal.

== Under wars ==

Under wars it says Operation Iraqi Freedom. However the M.O.A.B. has NEVER been used in active combat.
Can someone care to explain this for me? --[[User:68.44.106.218|68.44.106.218]] 03:14, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
:Although it was not used, MOAB was intended for use in OIF and weapons were in-theatre waiting for orders, close enough for me. - [[User:Aerobird|Aerobird]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User:Aerobird/Userboxes Created|Target locked]] - [[User_talk:Aerobird|Fox One]]!&lt;/sup&gt; 16:01, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

== Limited Military Application? ==

In the article it is stated, without a source, that there is little military application to this weapon other than to lower enemy morale. I highly doubt this. I am by no means an authority on the subject however I do recall hearing many times it is effective as a way of clearing out enemy positions entrenched in highly rugged/mountainous terrains (as well as being on par with the applications of FAE [fuel and air bomb, very devestating...]). Again I'm not an authority on the matter but perhaps if someone out there is knowledgeable in this could ascertain as to whether there is more to the application of this weapon other than simply damaging enemy morale; Perhaps know reliable sources to research and cite. I personlly believe this weapon is capable of, and has a mission profile pertaining to, more than a simple morale weapon.

:Until (if?) it gets used in combat, its primary mission may just be to secure bragging rights.  A [[Tsar Bomba]], as it were.  Time will tell.--[[User:Father Goose|Father Goose]] 21:44, 18 April 2007 (UTC)

:Ah, a very good point you make there, Father Goose. You're exactly right too, nothing is certain until it's actually used in combat. [[User:Jros83|John]] 23:35, 18 April 2007 (UTC)

== Nicknames ==
When I first heard of MOAB It was supposed to be short for &quot;Mother of All Bombs&quot;

Is this a semi offical nickname, or are there any actual nicknames?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Therubicon|Therubicon]] ([[User talk:Therubicon|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Therubicon|contribs]]) 16:17, 23 February 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Throughout the entire program, from almost the very first day, the name of the system was &quot;Mother Of All Bombs&quot;.  When it entered the inventory, the acronym was kept but the official name was changed to &quot;Massive Ordnance Air Blast&quot;.

==Misuse of the Daisy Cutter nickname==

I fear that the Wiki is helping to continue a misconception about the term &quot;Daisy Cutter&quot;.  The BLU-82 is NOT the Daisy Cutter - this refers only to the 38&quot; pole M904 extended fuse used to ignite the weapon for above ground bursts. This term has been used widely in the press that apparently doesn't understand the nomenclature of the weapon.

== Contradiction in the Evaluations section ==

In the Evaluations section there are two statements that appear to be in conflict.

In paragraph 1, &quot;....the MOAB is primarily intended for employment against deep and hardened targets.&quot;

In paragraph 3, &quot;The MOAB is not a penetrator weapon and is primarily intended for soft to medium surface targets.....&quot;

I have no clue about either assertion, but it is unclear that both can be correct.

==RTS Game==
I am surprised it was not mentioned before , the game is old but it was the most popular for the demonstration of the bomb's use in virtual world i think , so i added it in popular culture. [[User:Xowets|Xowets]] ([[User talk:Xowets|talk]]) 14:11, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

== Pronunciation ==

I don't think the sources for the pronunciation are legitimate.  Funny, but not true. --[[User:DM 794|DM 794]] ([[User talk:DM 794|talk]]) 21:21, 9 January 2012 (UTC)</text>
