The '''19th Punjabis''' was an infantry regiment of the [[British Indian Army]]. It was raised in 1857, as the 7th Regiment of Punjab Infantry. It was designated as the 19th Punjabis in 1903 and became 1st Battalion [[14th Punjab Regiment]] i.e 1/14 Punjab Regiment in 1922. In 1947, it was allocated to the [[Pakistan Army]], where it continues to exist as '''5th Battalion The [[Punjab Regiment (Pakistan)|Punjab Regiment]]''' (5th Punjab).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rizvi 1984&quot;&gt;Rizvi, Brig SHA. (1984). ''Veteran Campaigners – A History of the Punjab Regiment 1759-1981''. Lahore: Wajidalis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early History==
The regiment was formed during the upheaval of the [[Indian Mutiny]] in 1857 as the 7th Regiment of Punjab Infantry on the orders of [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]], the British Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, and saw service in North India. In 1864, it participated in the [[Bhutan war]], and during the [[Second Afghan War]] of 1878-80, the regiment fought with distinction in the Battle of Ahmed Khel. In 1891, it took part in the Black Hill Expedition and the 2nd Miranzai Expedition on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North West Frontier]] of India. In 1903, the 19th Punjab Infantry took part in the [[British expedition to Tibet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigot 1946&quot;&gt;Pigot, G. (1946). ''History of the 1st Battalion, 14th Punjab Regiment, Sherdil-ki-Paltan (late XIX Punjabis)''. New Delhi: Roxy Printing Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th Punjabis==
Subsequent to the [[Kitchener Reforms|reforms]] brought about in the Indian Army by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 19th Punjabis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaylor 1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaylor|first=John|title=Sons of John Company: The Indian and Pakistan Armies 1903–91|publisher=Stroud: Spellmount|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the outbreak of the [[First World War]], it initially remained in India guarding the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North West Frontier]] as part of the [[4th (Quetta) Division]]. In February 1916, it moved to [[Persia]], where it had the unique distinction of being actively engaged against the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1918 during the hard-fought actions at [[Merv]], [[Kaka, Turkmenistan|Kaka]] and [[Dushak]] in the [[Russian Turkestan]]. At Dushak, all the officers including the [[Subedar Major]] of the battalion were either killed or wounded, and the battalion was led by a [[Subedar]]. In 1917, the 19th Punjabis raised a second battalion, which was disbanded after the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigot 1946&quot;/&gt;

==Subsequent History==
In 1921-22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 14th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 19th Punjabis  with the [[20th Punjabis|20th]], [[21st Punjabis|21st]], [[22nd Punjabis|22nd]] and [[24th Punjabis]], and the [[40th Pathans]]. The battalion's new designation was 1st Battalion 14th Punjab Regiment. Battalion was often refereed to by the British as Battalion of Sherdil or ''Sherdil ki Paltan'' because of a Muslim Sepoy Sherdil known to hold some special spiritual powers and was found out by a British officer for offering prayers at one place and being on sentry duty at other at exactly the same time. &lt;ref name=&quot;Gaylor 1991&quot;/&gt; During the [[Second World War]], the battalion fought in the [[Malayan Campaign]] and was taken prisoner by the Japanese on [[Singapore Island]] following the British surrender on 15 February 1942. 90% of the officers and men of the battalion joined the Japanese Supported [[Indian National Army]] and fought against the British in the subsequent Battles. The battalion was re-raised in 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigot 1946&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haig, Brodie. ''Fourteenth Punjab Regiment 1939-1945''. London: Lund Humphries.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, the 14th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the [[1st Punjab Regiment|1st]], [[15th Punjab Regiment|15th]] and [[16th Punjab Regiment]]s to form one large [[Punjab Regiment (Pakistan)|Punjab Regiment]], and 1/14th Punjab was re designated as 5 Punjab ''Sherdils''. During the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, the battalion fought in [[Kashmir]], while in 1971, it was deployed in a defensive role at Mandi Sadiq Ganj in the Punjab.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rizvi 1984&quot;/&gt;[[File:19th Punjabis (5 Punjab) (Afridi, Sikh, Bangash, Swati, Yusufzai, PM) 1910.jpg|thumb|right|19th Punjabis.
