{{DYK talk|7 July|2009|{{*mp}}... that when [[List of Governors of Alaska|Alaska Governor]] [[Sarah Palin]] resigns on July 26, '''[[Craig Campbell (politician)|Craig Campbell]]''' ''(pictured)'' will become the new [[List of lieutenant governors of Alaska|Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Alaska]]?}}

== Resigning his commision ==

Will Campbel have to ''resign'' his commission (rank: Lieutenant General), upon becoming [[Lieutenant Governor of Alaska]]? [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 19:07, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

== What's his rank? ==

The infobox says Lt Gen, but he's only Maj Gen federally. Does he hold both ranks at the same time? [[User:Computerjoe|Computerjoe]][[User talk:Computerjoe|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'s talk&lt;/span&gt;]] 08:54, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
:Don't quote me on this, but I believe the higher rank only applies to instances where he's commanding the Alaska National Guard. If he were to leave the guard or command something else, he'd revert to the federal rank. [[User:JKBrooks85|JKBrooks85]] ([[User talk:JKBrooks85|talk]]) 11:24, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

== What is his position? ==

I watched the swearing-in ceremony at the Fox News site, and while the Supreme Court justice swore in Sean Parnell as Governor, he swore in Craig Campbell as &quot;temporary substitute for lieutenant governor.&quot;  Can anyone explain that?  Is he the lieutenant governor, or isn't he?  And does he serve until the end of the term, or does the &quot;temporary&quot; actually mean something?  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 23:39, 26 July 2009 (UTC)
:Since he was appointed to the position, it is pending the confirmation of the AK legislature on (I believe) August 10th. --[[User:Mherlihy|Mherlihy]] ([[User talk:Mherlihy|talk]]) 23:47, 26 July 2009 (UTC)
::Ok, that makes sense.  So one might argue that technically we should not be calling him the lieutenant governor until he is confirmed, but rather the interim or acting lieutenant governor?  If we can find an actual source that says that, it probably should be put into the article, but if not the article can survive the way it is for a couple of weeks.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 00:08, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

For that matter, do we have confirmation that he will serve in office as a Republican? Granted, he was appointed by a Republican, but is there some source for his party affiliation that does more than assume? [[User:Qqqqqq|Qqqqqq]] ([[User talk:Qqqqqq|talk]]) 02:30, 27 July 2009 (UTC)
:I haven't seen one.  I read the Wikipedia article on the town of which he was the mayor, and it says that the local positions are technically nonpartisan but everybody knows who is from which party.  So it would seem that he has never appeared on a ballot as a &quot;Republican&quot;, though if someone checked his voter registration, that is probably how he is registered.  Perhaps some enterprising journalist will look into that.  As for whether he is actually &quot;Lieutenant Governor&quot; before being confirmed by the Legislature, it seems to me that he probably isn't.  He was sworn in as &quot;temporary substitute&quot;, which I think in most places, would be called &quot;acting.&quot;  So, most likely at this point, he is acting (or similar terminology) lieutenant governor, which is what the article should say if it is correct.  Again, a source would be good.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 15:27, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

'''Found it''':  http://ltgov.state.ak.us/news.php?id=5.  And it is from the official state web site, no less.  He is &quot;temporary substitute Lieutenant Governor&quot; pending confirmation by the state legislature as LG.  Unfortunately this source does not mention any date when that vote is scheduled.  Mherlihy says it is August 10, now we just need a source for ''that''.  So anyway, I am changing the article to reflect his actual title at the moment and am taking out the reference to him being 12th (or whatever) LG, which officially he is not, yet.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 15:41, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

'''But''', alas, all of this raises a new question.  The intro still said that he &quot;is&quot; commander of the Alaska National Guard and &quot;holds&quot; the rank of Lt. Gen.  Is either of those still true?  I changed the &quot;is&quot; to &quot;was&quot; and re-worded the bit about his rank to kind-of avoid the issue.  But, yet again, a source is needed to tell us the story, and I looked on the Alaska Guard web site and did not immediately find the answer.  (I found a lot about my opportunities in the Guard, but I don't live in Alaska and doubt I am within the preferred age range at this point anyway.)  I somewhat doubt that he would be able to hold a state military rank and be lt. gov. at the same time (although as I point out above, he does not actually hold the position of LG yet.)  Whether one can be a lt. gov. and hold a ''federal'' National Guard rank (which in his case, is Major General, not Lt. General) is another issue, to which I do not know the answer.
