The '''2/7th Field Regiment''' was an [[Australian Army]] field [[artillery]] regiment that served during the [[Second World War]]. Formed in mid-1940 and assigned to the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]], the regiment was deployed to [[North African campaign|North Africa]], where it saw action around [[Siege of Tobruk|Tobruk]] in 1941 and in the [[First Battle of El Alamein|First]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Second Battles of El Alamein]] in 1942. It also undertook garrison duties in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]. In 1943, the regiment returned to Australia, after which it did not see action again until late in the war when it was committed to the landing at [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|Tarakan]] in 1945. Following the end of the war, the regiment returned to Australia and was disbanded in January 1946.

==History==
Raised in April 1940 from volunteers for overseas service as part of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]], the regiment's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel [[Tom Eastick|Thomas Eastick]], who had formerly commanded the 13th Field Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon formation, it initially consisted of a regimental headquarters and two [[Battery (artillery)|batteries]]: the 13th, which was formed in [[South Australia]], and the 14th, in [[Western Australia]]. Later, a third battery&amp;nbsp;– the 57th&amp;nbsp;– was added. The majority of the new regiment's initial intake of personnel&amp;nbsp;– particularly its officers&amp;nbsp;– were drawn from the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]]. In October, the regiment was assigned to the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]].&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10374second_world_war.asp |title=2/7th Field Regiment |publisher=Australian War Memorial |work=Second World War, 1939–1945 units |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|pp=92–93}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial training was split between [[Woodside Camp|Woodside]] and [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam Camps]] as the South Australian and Western Australian batteries remained in their respective states until November 1940 when the regiment was concentrated at [[Fremantle]] and deployed to the [[Middle East]] aboard the troopship ''Stratheden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|p=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving there in December, the regiment moved to Qastina in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where it undertook training, albeit without any equipment or vehicles, which were in short supply in the theatre as the British sought to make up losses in home regiments following the [[Fall of France]].&lt;ref name=Rungie94&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, it was not until April 1941 that the regiment received a supply of vehicles and its first artillery pieces. These came in the form of a mix of antiquated [[Ordnance QF 18 pounder|18-pounders]] and [[QF 4.5-inch howitzer|4.5-inch howitzers]]. These were replaced in July with twenty-four [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounders]] when the regiment moved to [[Mersa Matruh]],&lt;ref name=Rungie94/&gt; which it employed against German and Italian forces in defence of the garrison at [[Siege of Tobruk|Tobruk]] and then later around Halfaya Pass–Sidi Barrani before being withdrawn back to [[Cairo]], in [[Egypt]], where they undertook a training role from October 1941 to early 1942. During this time the regiment trained reinforcements for British and Commonwealth artillery units in the theatre and undertook daily shoots on the Almaza firing range.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AWM 023080 2 7th Field Regiment Cairo 1942.jpg|left|thumb|One of the regiment's 25-pounders firing at Almaza, January 1942]]

A move to [[Syria]] followed in February and for a while the regiment was based around [[Tripoli]] and then [[Aleppo]] where they were assigned to support the [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]] as they undertook garrison duties following the successful Allied campaign against the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The regiment remained there until the middle part of 1942 when the regiment was committed to both the [[First Battle of El Alamein|First]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Second Battles of El Alamein]].&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; During this time, the regiment fired 157,847 shells of all types, including smoke, and suffered 36 killed and 73 wounded.&lt;ref name=Rungie105&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|p=105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1943, the regiment was withdrawn back to Australia along with the rest of the 9th Division as the Australian Army's focus shifted towards fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific. Embarking upon the Dutch troopship [[SS Nieuw Amsterdam (1937)|''Nieuw Amsterdam'']], on 18 February the men from the 14th Battery were landed in Fremantle for leave, while the rest of the regiment continued on to [[Port Melbourne]] where they were transferred to a train on 25 February and moved by rail to [[Adelaide]] for three weeks of leave.&lt;ref name=Rungie105/&gt;

Upon completion of this leave, the regiment was reconstituted on the [[Atherton Tablelands]] in [[Queensland]], along with the rest of the 9th Division. In July 1943, Lieutenant Colonel William Green took over command of the regiment and as the 9th Division was [[Jungle division|re-organised and re-equipped to take part in jungle warfare]], the regiment was reformed on a reduced equipment scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rungie105&quot;/&gt; Two batteries&amp;nbsp;– the 13th and 57th continued to operate the standard 25-pounders, while the 14th was re-equipped with the [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder Short|Short version]].&lt;ref name=Rungie108&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Training progressed well, but in  September 1943, when the division left to take part in the [[Landing at Lae]] and the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]], the 2/7th remained in the Australia. This was because it had deemed by Australian planners that artillery only had a limited role to play in jungle warfare and, consequently, when the 9th Division deployed it only took one field regiment with it: the [[2/12th Field Regiment (Australia)|2/12th]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rungie 1986 105–106&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|pp=105–106}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the regiment spent a total of 22 months out of action on the Atherton Tablelands and it was not until late in the war, in mid-1945, that it was deployed on operations again. When it came, it was under [[Operation Oboe]], which saw them once again fire in support of the 9th Division.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; Assigned to the [[26th Brigade (Australia)|26th Brigade]] which was to [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|capture Tarakan]], in April 1945 the regiment was moved to [[Morotai Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the main landing at Lingkas on 1 May, the 57th Battery landed on Sadau Island, where they established themselves to fire on Lingkas to provide cover for engineers that were tasked with clearing the beach obstacles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rungie 1986 105–106&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=410}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following morning the battery fired in direct support of the seaborne assault; it was the first time ever that a unit of the [[Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery|Royal Australian Artillery]] was ever employed in such a role.&lt;ref name=Rungie108/&gt; Once the beachhead was established amidst some confusion caused by muddy conditions and congestion, both the 13th and 14th Batteries came ashore and by 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm on the first day, they were both in action, while the 57th was also moved to Tarakan from Sadau late in the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|pp=108–109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next three months they would fire over 37,000 rounds in support of the 26th Brigade's three infantry battalions;&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; this included rounds from a captured Japanese 75&amp;nbsp;mm mountain gun. The regiment also provided fire control for a 3.7-inch anti-aircraft gun from the 132nd Anti-Aircraft Battery that was employed to clear areas of thick jungle and which was co-located with the regiment's guns in a position that came to be known as &quot;HMAS ''Margy''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rungie110&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AWM 108885 2 7th Field Regiment and 2 9th Armoured Regiment Tarakan June 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Guns from the 2/7th Field Regiment fire along with Matilda tanks from the [[2/9th Armoured Regiment (Australia)|2/9th Armoured Regiment]] at &quot;HMAS ''Margy''&quot;, Tarakan, June 1945]]

In order to maintain ammunition supplies, the regiment was resupplied by air from Morotai, while the captured Japanese gun was resupplied as rounds were found by the advancing troops. In total 851 rounds were fired from this gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|pp=110–111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure accuracy in the dense jungle, forward observers were detached forward with infantry patrols and even sent aloft on board small observation aircraft.&lt;ref name=Rungie110/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=451}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The regiment's casualties during this time amounted to seven killed and 27 wounded.&lt;ref name=Rungie111&gt;{{harvnb|Rungie|1986|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conclusion of hostilities in August 1945, the regiment remained on Tarakan as the [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II|demobilisation process]], which had begun in early July,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=450}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was ramped up. Slowly the regiment's size declined and by 30 November 28 officers and 324 other ranks had been repatriated to Australia. The following month the regiment turned in its guns and the last of its personnel left Tarakan on board ''Stanford Victory''. The regiment was finally disbanded on 30 January 1946.&lt;ref name=Rungie111/&gt;

During the course of its service, the 2/7th lost 45 men killed in action or died on active service. The following decorations were awarded: three [[Distinguished Service Order]]s, one [[Military Cross]], four [[Military Medal]]s and two [[Mentioned in Despatches|Mentions in Despatches]].&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;
