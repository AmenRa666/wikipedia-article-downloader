'''Arthur Clifford Hartley''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (7 January 1889 – 28 January 1960) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[civil engineer]].&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite web|first=A.C.|last=Vivian|title=‘Hartley, Arthur Clifford (1889–1960)’|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33740|accessdate=7 June 2008|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/33740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating with a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Imperial College London]], Hartley worked for the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] and an [[asphalt]] manufacturer before joining the [[Royal Flying Corps]] during [[World War I]]. He became a qualified pilot, with the rank of [[major (United Kingdom)|major]] and joined the [[Air Ministry|Air Board]] where he was involved with the development of [[synchronization gear|interrupter gear]]. His war work was rewarded with his appointment as an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE). He left the corps after the war and spent five years as a consulting engineer before he joined the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (later Anglo-Iranian).

During the [[Second World War]] Hartley was seconded to the government where he was involved in the development of the [[bombsight]] which sank the ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]'', the [[Operation Pluto]] pipeline project and the [[Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO)|FIDO]] fog dispersion system. Following the war he was rewarded with an appointment as [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE), a [[United States]] [[Medal of Freedom]] and £9000 cash. He retired from Anglo-Iranian in 1951 and was elected president of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]. He was elected president of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] in 1959, but died three months into his tenure.

==Early life==
Hartley was born at Springbank, [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] on 7 January 1889 to George Thomas Hartley, a surgeon, and his wife Elizabeth Briggs.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He was educated at [[Hymers College]] and [[Hull Municipal Technical College]] before attending the [[City and Guilds College]], the engineering department of [[Imperial College London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IME&quot;&gt;[http://heritage.imeche.org/historyimeche/pastpresidents/president/ACHartley.htm Institution of Mechanical Engineers biography]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|third class honours]] [[bachelor's degree]] in engineering in 1910. After graduation he found employment with the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] in the office of their chief docks engineer at Hull and from 1912-14 with [[asphalt]] makers Rose, Down and Thompson Limited.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=IME/&gt;

==First World War==
During the [[First World War]] Hartley was commissioned into the [[Royal Flying Corps]] as a [[second lieutenant]] on 23 August 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29738|supp=yes|startpage=8790|endpage=8791|date=5 September 1916|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a qualified pilot. He was promoted [[First Lieutenant|lieutenant]] on 22 February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30625|supp=yes|startpage=4417|endpage=4418|date=9 April 1918|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the war with the rank of [[major (United Kingdom)|major]]. During the war Hartley joined the armaments section of the [[Air Ministry|Air Board]], working with [[Bertram Hopkinson]]. He was responsible for the Air Board's development of [[George Constantinescu]]'s [[synchronization gear|interrupter gear]] which allowed a machine gun to be fired through the propeller blades of an aircraft without danger of damage.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; This invention was said by Air Vice Marshal Sir [[John Maitland (RAF officer)|John Maitland]] to be responsible for air superiority over German aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fluid.power.net/fpn/const/const008.html Biography of George Constantinescu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304110845/http://fluid.power.net/fpn/const/const008.html |date=4 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to the [[Royal Air Force]] on its establishment as a separate service. He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) on 10 October 1919 in recognition of his war work.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31592|supp=yes|startpage=12525|endpage=12526|date=7 October 1919|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interbellum==
After the war Hartley worked as a consulting engineer for five years before joining the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] in 1924 as assistant manager of its  engineering division.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  He became assistant manager of the supply department later the same year and from 1932 to 1934 he was seconded to the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]], on his return being appointed chief engineer.&lt;ref name=IME/&gt; The company became the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/149259.stm BBC profile of BP]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
[[File:Pluto pipline.jpg|thumb|right|A section of PLUTO pipeline]]
Following the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Hartley was seconded from Anglo-Iranian to the [[Ministry of Aircraft Production]] in 1940. From 1940-1 he assisted with the development of a stabilized [[bombsight]] which was used by [[RAF Bomber Command]] in the sinking of the German [[battleship]] ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]'' in 1944.&lt;ref name=IME/&gt; From 1942 Hartley worked with the [[Petroleum Warfare Department]] and was appointed as its technical director. Here he developed, at the request of [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Arthur Travers Harris|Arthur Harris]], the [[Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation]] which was known as FIDO. This was a means of burning oil along runways to disperse fog. The system was installed at fifteen airfields across Britain, beginning in 1943.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; FIDO is credited with bringing 2,500 aircraft and 10,000 aircrew safely home during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Hartley also developed the pipes used in [[Operation Pluto]] ('''P'''ipe '''L'''ines '''U'''nder '''T'''he '''O'''cean), a series of twenty-one undersea pipes used to transport oil from Britain to continental Europe to support the [[Liberation of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.combinedops.com/pluto.htm#Pipe-Laying%20Operations Description of Pluto]&lt;/ref&gt; The system supplied the allied armies with {{convert|1|e6USgal|m3}} of fuel per day during the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|advance into Germany]], and Hartley received £9000 after the war for his work on Pluto from the [[Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors]]. He also received an appointment as [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1944.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|startpage=2586|date=2 June 1944|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartley was awarded the [[United States]] [[Medal of Freedom]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=IME/&gt; He retired from Anglo-Iranian (which would become [[British Petroleum]] in 1954) in 1951 and became an engineering consultant during which time he developed the Hartley hoister – a device which allowed the loading of [[oil tanker]]s offshore. He was elected president of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] in 1951 and was an honorary fellow of the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He was also made an honorary fellow of [[Imperial College London]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/college/aboutimperial/imperial_people/fellows Imperial College records]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 he received the Redwood Medal of the [[Institute of Petroleum]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Civ3&quot;&gt;{{cite book
