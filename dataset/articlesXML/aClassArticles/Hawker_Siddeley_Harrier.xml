The '''Hawker Siddeley Harrier''', developed in the 1960s, was the first of the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] series of aircraft. It was the first operational [[ground attack aircraft|close-support]] and [[reconnaissance]] [[fighter aircraft]] with [[vertical/short takeoff and landing]] (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose in that era. The Harrier was developed directly from the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127|Hawker Siddeley Kestrel]] prototype aircraft, following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft, the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1154]]. The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) ordered the Harrier GR.1 and GR.3 variants in the late 1960s. It was exported to the United States as the AV-8A, for use by the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC), in the 1970s.

During the Harrier's service the RAF positioned the bulk of the aircraft in [[West Germany]] to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by the [[Warsaw Pact]] forces; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases. The USMC used their Harriers primarily for [[close air support]], operating from [[amphibious assault ship]]s, and, if needed, [[forward operating base]]s. Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas. The Harrier's ability to operate with minimal ground facilities and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft. The Harrier received criticism for having a high accident rate and for a time-consuming maintenance process.

In the 1970s the [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier]] was developed from the Harrier for use by the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) on {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier}}s. The Sea Harrier and the Harrier fought in the 1982 [[Falklands War]], in which the aircraft proved to be crucial and versatile. The RN Sea Harriers provided fixed-wing air defence while the RAF Harriers focused on ground-attack missions in support of the advancing British land force. The Harrier was also extensively redesigned as the [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier II]] and [[British Aerospace Harrier II]] by the team of [[McDonnell Douglas]] and [[British Aerospace]]. The innovative Harrier family and its [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus]] engines with [[thrust vectoring]] nozzles have generated long-term interest in V/STOL aircraft. Similar V/STOL operational aircraft include the contemporary Soviet [[Yakovlev Yak-38]]. The F-35B V/STOL variant of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] is under development.

==Development==

===Origins===
{{Main|Hawker Siddeley P.1127}}
&lt;!-- This section is a summary. Please add new material to the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]] article. --&gt;

The Harrier's design was derived from the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127|Hawker P.1127]]. Prior to developing the P.1127 [[Hawker Aircraft]] had been working on a replacement for the [[Hawker Hunter]], the [[Hawker P.1121]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Thornborough 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The P.1121 was cancelled after the release of the British Government's [[1957 Defence White Paper]], which advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. This policy resulted in the termination of the majority of aircraft development projects then underway for the British military.&lt;ref name= Jefford_11&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawker sought to quickly move on to a new project and became interested in Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) aircraft, which did not need runways.{{refn|The development of a V/STOL jet was not Hawker's primary objective as it had put in a joint bid with [[Avro]] to meet the GOR.339 Requirement (which resulted in the [[BAC TSR-2]] development programme), but had been unsuccessful. The inability to obtain work on conventional aircraft in a hostile political climate was perhaps the greatest motivation for Hawker to proceed with the development of the Harrier.&lt;ref name= Jefford_25&gt;Jefford 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} According to Air Chief Marshal [[Patrick Hine|Sir Patrick Hine]] this interest may have been stimulated by the presence of Air Staff Requirement 345, which sought a V/STOL ground attack fighter for the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref name= &quot;Jefford_11–12&quot;&gt;Jefford 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design work on the P.1127 was formally started in 1957 by Sir [[Sydney Camm]], [[Ralph Hooper]] of Hawker Aircraft, and [[Stanley Hooker]] (later Sir Stanley Hooker) of the [[Bristol Engine Company]].&lt;ref name= Jefford_26-27&gt;Jefford 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The close cooperation between Hawker, the airframe company, and Bristol, the engine company, was viewed by project engineer [[Gordon Lewis (engineer)|Gordon Lewis]] as one of the key factors that allowed the development of the Harrier to continue in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks.&lt;ref name= Jefford_23&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than using rotors or a direct jet thrust, the P.1127 had an innovative [[thrust vectoring|vectored thrust]] [[turbofan engine]], the [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus]]. The Pegasus I was rated at {{convert|9000|lb(f)|kN|sigfig=2}} of thrust and first ran in September 1959.&lt;ref name= Jefford_24&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; A contract for two development prototypes was signed in June 1960 and the first flight followed in October 1960.&lt;ref name= Jefford_24/&gt; Of the six prototypes built three crashed—including one during an air display at the 1963 [[Paris Air Show]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason 91 p413-6&quot;&gt;Mason 1991, pp. 413–416.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tripartite evaluation===
[[File:Hawker Siddeley XV-6A Kestrel USAF.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley XV-6A Kestrel in later USAF markings|alt=An aircraft landed on a runway]]

In 1961 the United Kingdom, United States and [[West Germany]] jointly agreed to purchase nine aircraft developed from the P.1127, for the evaluation of the performance and potential of V/STOL aircraft. These aircraft were built by [[Hawker Siddeley]] and were [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] ''Kestrel FGA.1'' by the UK.&lt;ref name= Jefford_39&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kestrel was strictly an evaluation aircraft and to save money the Pegasus 5 engine was not fully developed as intended, only having {{convert|15000|lb(f)|kN|sigfig=2}} of thrust instead of the projected {{convert|18200|lb(f)|kN|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name= Jefford_39/&gt; The Tripartite Evaluation Squadron numbered ten pilots; four each from the UK and US and two from West Germany.&lt;ref name= Jefford_39/&gt; The Kestrel's first flight took place on 7 March 1964.&lt;ref name= Jefford_41&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 960 sorties had been made during the trials, including 1,366 takeoffs and landings, by the end of evaluations in November 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Spick 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Jefford_47&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt; One aircraft was destroyed in an accident and six others were transferred to the United States, assigned the US designation ''XV-6A Kestrel'', and underwent further testing.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, A. &quot;American Harrier – Part One.&quot; ''Model Aircraft Monthly'', Vol. 8, Issue 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;36–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Kenneth J. and Charles R. Rosburg.

Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The two remaining British-based Kestrels were assigned to further trials and experimentation at [[RAE Bedford]] with one being modified to use the uprated Pegasus 6 engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason 91 p419-0&quot;&gt;Mason 1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;419–420.&lt;/ref&gt;

===P.1154===
{{main|Hawker Siddeley P.1154}}

At the time of the development of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a [[supersonic]] version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft.&lt;ref name= Jefford_12&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; The design used a single [[Bristol Siddeley BS100]] engine with four swivelling nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of [[afterburner|plenum chamber burning]] (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds.&lt;ref name= 'buttler 119-120'&gt;Buttler 2000, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as [[Dassault Aviation]]'s [[Dassault Mirage IIIV|Mirage IIIV]]. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.&lt;ref name= Jefford_12-13&gt;Jefford 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The Mirage IIIV had been rejected mainly because of its excessive complexity, using nine engines compared with the P.1154's single engine approach.&lt;ref name= Jefford_19&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

The Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy planned to develop and introduce the supersonic P.1154 independently of the cancelled NATO requirement. This ambition was complicated by the conflicting requirements between the two services—while the RAF wanted a low-level supersonic strike aircraft, the Navy sought a twin-engine [[air defence]] fighter.&lt;ref name= Jefford_13&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election of the Labour Government of 1964 the P.1154 was cancelled, as the Royal Navy had already begun procurement of the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas Phantom II]] and the RAF placed a greater importance on the [[BAC TSR-2]]'s ongoing development.&lt;ref name= Jefford_13/&gt; Work continued on elements of the project, such as a supersonic PCB-equipped Pegasus engine, with the intention of developing a future Harrier variant for the decades following cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;Moxton 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;1633.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The supersonic Harrier is not to be confused with the Big Wing Harrier. Neither concept would result in a successor aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Moxton 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;1635.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

===Production===
Following the collapse of the P.1154's development the RAF began considering a simple upgrade of the existing subsonic Kestrel and issued Requirement ASR 384 for a V/STOL ground attack jet.&lt;ref name= Jefford_13/&gt; Hawker Siddeley received an order for six pre-production aircraft in 1965, designated ''P.1127 (RAF)'', of which the first made its maiden flight on 31 August 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;mason harrier p78&quot;&gt;Mason 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt; An order for 60 production aircraft, designated as Harrier GR.1, was received in early 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason harrier p81&quot;&gt;Mason 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%201559.html &quot;VTOL Aircraft 1966&quot;.] ''Flight International'', 26 May 1966. p.&amp;nbsp;884. Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The aircraft was named for the [[Harrier (bird)|Harrier]], a small bird of prey.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Harrier GR.1 made its first flight on 28 December 1967. It officially entered service with the RAF on 18 April 1969 when the Harrier Conversion Unit at [[RAF Wittering]] received its first aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans p21-22&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft were built in two factories—one in [[Kingston upon Thames]], southwest London, and the other at [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]], Surrey—and underwent initial testing at Dunsfold.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_66&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Flight deck#Ski-jump ramp|ski-jump]] technique for launching Harriers from Royal Navy aircraft carriers was extensively trialled at [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]] from 1977. Following these tests ski-jumps were added to the flight decks of all RN carriers from 1979 onwards, in preparation for the new variant for the navy, the Sea Harrier.&lt;ref&gt;Vann 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s the British and American governments held talks on producing Harriers in the United States. Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas formed a partnership in 1969 in preparation for American production,&lt;ref name= Nordeen_28&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; but Congressman [[Mendel Rivers]] and the [[House Appropriations Committee]] held that it would be cheaper to produce the AV-8A on the pre-existing production lines in the United Kingdom—hence all AV-8A Harriers were purchased from Hawker Siddeley.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_28/&gt; Improved Harrier versions with better sensors and more powerful engines were developed in later years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p31,3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WAPJ6 p54&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= Nordeen_35/&gt;  The USMC received 102 AV-8A and 8 TAV-8A Harriers between 1971 and 1976.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_31&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

===Overview===
The Harrier was typically used as a ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges.&lt;ref name= Brown_71&gt;Brown 1970, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrier is powered by a single [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus]] [[turbofan]] engine mounted in the fuselage. The engine is fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring nozzles for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight.&lt;ref name= Brown_81&gt;Brown 1970, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; It has two landing gear units on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear units, one near each wing tip.&lt;ref name= Brown_80&gt;Brown 1970, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.&lt;ref name=spick_364&gt;Spick 2000, pp. 364–371.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AV-8A VMA-513 NAN2-71.jpg|thumb|left|An RAF Harrier GR.1, on loan to the USMC, displaying its underside with a full load of bombs|alt=A Harrier in flight, with large weapons loadout underneath]]

The Kestrel and the Harrier were similar in appearance, though approximately 90 per cent of the Kestrel's airframe was redesigned for the Harrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason harrier p75&quot;&gt;Mason 1986, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrier was powered by the more powerful Pegasus 6 engine; new air intakes with auxiliary blow-in doors were added to produce the required airflow at low speed. Its wing was modified to increase area and the landing gear was strengthened. Several [[hardpoint]]s were installed, two under each wing and one underneath the fuselage; two {{convert|30|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} [[ADEN cannon]] [[gun pod]]s could also be fitted to the underside of the fuselage. The Harrier was outfitted with updated avionics to replace the basic systems used in the Kestrel;{{refn|Some avionics systems used in the Harrier had been carried over from the cancelled [[BAC TSR-2]], such as the Weapon Aiming Computer.&lt;ref name= 'Jefford 48'&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} a navigational-attack system incorporating an [[inertial navigation system]], originally for the P.1154, was installed and information was presented to the pilot by a [[head-up display]] and a moving map display.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason Harrier p73-6&quot;&gt;Mason 1986, pp. 73–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p14,6&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, pp. 14, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrier's VTOL abilities allowed it to be deployed from very small prepared clearings or helipads as well as normal airfields.{{refn|The area needed for a Harrier to comfortably take off was said to be less than a tennis court, while the majority of aircraft required a two-mile-long runway.&lt;ref name= Brown_82&gt;Brown 1970, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} It was believed that, in a high-intensity conflict, air bases would be vulnerable and likely to be quickly knocked out.{{refn|Experience from the Second World War had made this vulnerability abundantly clear to many Air Force officers around the world; this perception of vulnerability contributed heavily to the interest in and development of VTOL aircraft like the Harrier.&lt;ref name= Jefford_9&gt;Jefford 2005, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} The capability to scatter Harrier squadrons to dozens of small &quot;alert pads&quot; on the front lines was highly prized by military strategists and the USMC procured the aircraft because of this ability.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1970, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Some officers went so far as to deride conventional aircraft, unfavourably comparing to the [[Maginot Line]], as static and highly vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.W. [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1977/nov-dec/taylor.html &quot;The Impact of V/STOL on Tactical Air Warfare&quot;.] ''Air University Review'', November–December 1977. Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Hawker Siddeley noted that STOL operation provided additional benefits over VTOL operation, saving fuel and allowing the aircraft to carry more ordnance.&lt;ref name= Brown_83&gt;Brown 1970, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I still don't believe the Harrier. Think of the millions that have been spent on VTO in America and Russia, and quite a bit in Europe, and yet the only vertical take-off aircraft which you can call a success is the Harrier. When I saw the Harrier hovering and flying backwards under control, I reckoned I'd seen everything. And it's not difficult to fly.&quot; -[[Thomas Sopwith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%200033.html|title=camel - harrier - anthony fokker - 1979 - 0033 - Flight Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Harrier, while serving for many decades in various forms, has been criticised on multiple issues; in particular a [[List of Harrier Jump Jet family losses|high accident rate]], though Nordeen notes that several conventional single-engine strike aircraft like the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]] had worse accident rates.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_155&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported in 2003 that the Harrier &quot;...has amassed the highest major accident rate of any military plane now in service. Forty-five Marines have died in 148 noncombat accidents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alan C. Miller and Sack, Kevin. [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/11/nation/na-harrier11 &quot;Harrier Crash Renews Calls for an Inquiry.&quot;] ''Los Angeles Times'', 11 December 2003. Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Lee Buland of the USMC declared the maintenance of a Harrier to be a &quot;challenge&quot;; the need to remove the wings before performing most work upon the engine, including engine replacements, meant the Harrier required considerable man-hours in maintenance, more than most aircraft. Buland noted however that the maintenance difficulties were unavoidable in order to create a V/STOL aircraft.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_118&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engine===
{{main|Rolls-Royce Pegasus}}
[[File:Aircraft engine RR Pegasus cut-out RH.jpg|thumb|Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine on display, sections have been cut out to provide an internal view|alt=Aircraft engine, partially uncovered as an exhibit]]

The Pegasus turbofan jet engine, developed in tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring.

The Harrier has been described by pilots as &quot;unforgiving&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft is capable of both forward flight (where it behaves in the manner of a typical fixed-wing aircraft above its [[Stall (flight)|stall]] speed), as well as [[VTOL]] and [[STOL]] manoeuvres (where the traditional [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[Flight control surfaces|control surfaces]] are useless) requiring skills and technical knowledge usually associated with helicopters. Most services demand great aptitude and extensive training for Harrier pilots, as well as experience in piloting both types of aircraft. Trainee pilots are often drawn from highly experienced and skilled helicopter pilots.{{refn|In preparation for flying the Kestrel, pilots of the Tripartite Evaluation Squadron were provided with several hours of helicopter piloting tuition, all of whom agreed on the effort being highly worthwhile preparation.&lt;ref name= Jefford_41/&gt;|group=N}}&lt;ref name= Jefford_41/&gt;

In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling the direction of the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit.&lt;ref name= Jefford_42&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.&lt;ref&gt;Markman and Holder 2000, pp. 74–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_25&gt;Jenkins 1998, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrier has two control elements not found in conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the [[reaction control system]]. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the [[Helicopter flight controls#Cyclic|cyclic control]] of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.&lt;ref name= Jefford_36&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wind direction is a critical factor in VTOL manoeuvres. The procedure for vertical takeoff involves facing the aircraft into the wind. The thrust vector is set to 90° and the throttle is brought up to maximum, at which point the aircraft leaves the ground. The throttle is trimmed until a hover state is achieved at the desired altitude.&lt;ref name= Brown_83/&gt;  The short-takeoff procedure involves proceeding with normal takeoff and then applying a thrust vector (less than 90°) at a runway speed below normal takeoff speed; usually the point of application is around {{convert|65|kn|km/h}}. For lower takeoff speeds the thrust vector is greater.&lt;ref name= Jefford_42/&gt; The reaction control system involves a thrusters at key points in the aircraft's fuselage and nose, also the wingtips. Thrust from the engine can be temporarily syphoned to control and correct the aircraft's pitch and roll during vertical flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/control/TH28G9.htm &quot;Hawker Harrier reaction control system&quot;] ''U.S. Centennial of Flight'', 2003. Retrieved 28 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rotating the vectored thrust nozzles into a forward-facing position during normal flight is called [[vectoring in forward flight]], or &quot;VIFFing&quot;. This is a [[dog fight|dog-fighting]] tactic, allowing for more sudden braking and higher turn rates. Braking could cause a chasing aircraft to overshoot and present itself as a target for the Harrier it was chasing, a combat technique formally developed by the USMC for the Harrier in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_33-4&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spick_382&gt;Spick 2000, pp. 382–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between versions===
The two largest users of the Harrier were the Royal Air Force and the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The exported model of the aircraft operated by the USMC was designated the AV-8A Harrier, which was broadly similar to the RAF's Harrier GR.1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p43&quot;/&gt; Changes included the removal of all magnesium components, which corroded quickly at sea, and the integration of American radios and [[Identification Friend or Foe]] (IFF) systems; furthermore the outer pylons, unlike the RAF aircraft, were designed from delivery to be equipped with self-defence [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] heat-seeking air-to-air missiles.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_31/&gt; Most of the AV-8As had been delivered with the more powerful Pegasus engine used in the GR.3 instead of the one used in the earlier GR.1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p43&quot;/&gt; Two-seat Harriers were operated for training purposes; the body was stretched and a taller tail fin added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p27-8&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF trained in the T.2 and T.4 versions, while T.4N and T.8 were training versions the Navy's Sea Harrier, with appropriate fittings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p67-8&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, pp. 67–68, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The US and Spain flew the TAV-8A and TAV-8S, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p50&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Nordeen_14&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

All RAF GR.1s and the initial AV-8As were fitted with the Ferranti FE541 inertial navigation/attack suite, but these were replaced in the USMC Harriers by a simpler Interface/Weapon Aiming Computer to aid quick turnaround between missions. The [[Martin-Baker]] ejection seats were also replaced by the [[Stencel SEU-3A]] in the American aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason Harrier p115-9&quot;&gt;Mason 1986, pp. 115–119.&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF had their GR.1 aircraft upgraded to the GR.3 standard, which featured improved sensors, a nose-mounted laser tracker, the integration of [[electronic countermeasure]] (ECM) systems and a further upgraded Pegasus Mk 103.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p31,3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WAPJ6 p54&quot;/&gt; The USMC upgraded their AV-8As to the AV-8C configuration; this programme involved the installation of ECM equipment and adding a new [[inertial navigation]] system to the aircraft's avionics. Substantial changes were the Lift Improvement Devices, to increase VTOL performance; at the same time several airframe components were restored or replaced to extend the life of the aircraft.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_35/&gt; Spain's Harriers, designated AV-8S or VA.1 Matador for the single-seater and TAV-8S or VAE.1 for the two-seater, were almost identical to USMC Harriers differing only in the radios fitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p77-8&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) operated a substantially modified variant of the Harrier, the [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier]]. The Sea Harrier was not intended for ground-attack duties and, unlike the standard Harrier, was equipped with [[radar]] and Sidewinder missiles for air combat duties and [[air defence|fleet air defence]].{{refn|While the USMC Harriers had Sidewinder missiles, they still lacked radars.|group=N}} The Sea Harrier was also fitted with navigational aids for carrier landings, modifications to reduce corrosion and a raised bubble-canopy for greater visibility.&lt;ref name =&quot;Bull 120&quot;&gt;Bull 2004, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p51&gt;Jenkins 1998, pp. 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft were later equipped to use [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] [[Beyond-visual-range missile|beyond-visual-range]] anti-aircraft missiles and the more advanced Blue Vixen radar for longer range air-to-air combat, as well as [[Sea Eagle missile]]s for conducting anti-ship missions.&lt;ref name= &quot;New Science Harrier 2&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BX7c6gVuyVQC&amp;pg=PA780&amp;dq=Sea+Harrier&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lNkfTJ2BDs6TOMXCya0M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Sea%20Harrier&amp;f=false &quot;Navy puts more punch in its Harriers&quot;.] ''New Scientist'', 98(1362), 16 June 1983, p. 780.

The [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II]] is the latest Harrier variant, a second-generation series to replace the first generation of Harrier jets already in service; all the above variants of the Harrier have mainly been retired with the Harrier II taking their place in the RAF, USMC and FAA. In the 1970s the United Kingdom considered two options for replacing their existing Harriers: joining [[McDonnell Douglas]] (MDD) in developing the [[BAE Harrier II]], or the independent development of a &quot;Big Wing&quot; Harrier. This proposal would have increased the wing area from {{convert|200|to|250|ft2|m2|sigfig=2}}, allowing for significant increases in weapons load and internal fuel reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Jefford 2006, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The option of cooperation with MDD was chosen in 1982 over the more risky isolated approach.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In RAF service, the Harrier was used in [[close air support]] (CAS), reconnaissance, and other ground-attack roles. The flexibility of the Harrier led to a long-term heavy deployment in [[West Germany]] as a conventional deterrent and potential strike weapon against Soviet aggression; from camouflaged rough bases the Harrier was expected to launch attacks on advancing armour columns from [[East Germany]].&lt;ref name= RAF_Museum/&gt; Harriers were also deployed to bases in Norway and [[Belize]], a former British colony.&lt;ref name= RAF_Museum&gt;[http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/london/collections/aircraft/bae-harrier-gr3.cfm &quot;BAe Harrier GR3 Aircraft History – Post-World War Two Aircraft&quot;.] ''RAF Museum.''

Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace explored the Skyhook, a new technique to operate Harriers from smaller ships. Skyhook would have allowed the launching and landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming.

The forward bases, containing one to four aircraft, were to be located {{convert|20|mi|km}} from the forward edge of battle (FEBA), while a more established permanent airbase would be located around {{convert|50|mi|km}} from the FEBA.&lt;ref name= 'bingham'/&gt;{{refn|Dispersed forward bases were heavily reliant on effective transportation to refuel and rearm the Harriers; possessing a large fleet of air transports, helicopters or ground vehicles to support such operations was identified as crucial by USMC senior officers. It was planned that supplies would to be regularly ferried by [[Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion]]s from main bases to all forward bases.&lt;ref name= 'bingham'/&gt;|group=N}} The close proximity of forward bases allowed for a far greater [[sortie]] rate and reduced fuel consumption.&lt;ref name= 'bingham'/&gt;

The AV-8A's abilities in air-to-air combat were tested by the Marine Corps by conducting mock dogfights with [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s; these exercises trained pilots to use the vectoring-in-forward-flight (VIFF) capability to outmanoeuvre their opponents and showed that the Harriers could act as effective air-to-air fighters at close range.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_33-4/&gt; The success of Harrier operations countered scepticism of V/STOL aircraft, which had been judged to be expensive failures in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Congress 1979, pp. 8, 166, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Marine Corps officers became convinced of the military advantages of the Harrier and pursued extensive development of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliland, Woody F.

Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1979 the USMC began upgrading their AV-8As to the AV-8C configuration—the work focused mainly on extending useful service lives and improving VTOL performance.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_35&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The AV-8C and the remaining AV-8A Harriers were retired by 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 1998, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  These were replaced by the Harrier II, designated as the AV-8B, which was introduced into service in 1985.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_36&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp. 36, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of the Harrier in USMC service led to calls for the [[United States Air Force]] to procure Harrier IIs in addition to the USMC's own plans,&lt;ref name= 'bingham'&gt;Bingham, Price T. [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1985/jan-feb/bingham.html &quot;Improving Force Flexibility Through V/STOL&quot;.] ''Air University Review'', January–February 1985. Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but these never resulted in Air Force orders. Since the late 1990s, the AV-8B has been slated to be replaced by the F-35B variant of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]], a more modern V/STOL jet aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Eden 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the next generation AV-8Bs, nevertheless, the AV-8A/C Harriers suffered many accidents, with around 40 aircraft lost and some 30 pilots killed during '70 and '80s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/17/nation/na-wall17 &quot;More Than a Few Good Men.&quot;] ''&lt;Los Angeles Times.''

Due to the Harrier's unique characteristics it attracted a large amount of interest from other nations, often as attempts to make their own V/STOL jets were unsuccessful, such as in the cases of the American [[XV-4 Hummingbird]] and the German [[VFW VAK 191B]].{{refn|Kevin Brown of ''Popular Mechanics'' described the development efforts of performance vertical aircraft as having &quot;long eluded the best efforts of the aviation industry&quot;, and noted that several American efforts had been &quot;spectacularly unsuccessful&quot;.&lt;ref name= Brown_81/&gt;|group=N}} Operations by the USMC aboard {{USS|Nassau|LHA-4|6}} in 1981 and by British Harriers and [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]] in the Falklands War proved that the aircraft were highly effective in combat. These operations also demonstrated that &quot;Harrier Carriers&quot; provided a powerful presence at sea without the expense of big deck carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp. 36–38.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Politically, the British government had decided not to use aircraft carriers after the 1960s, due to the costs involved. The {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s had been developed under the official guise of being an anti-submarine Through Deck Cruiser, but the approved development of the Sea Harrier and the addition of [[ski-jump]]s to the design enabled ships of the ''Invincible'' class to perform as [[light aircraft carrier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop and Chant 2004, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fozard, John.

Following the display of Harrier operations from small carriers, the navies of Spain and later Thailand bought the Harrier for use as their main carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft.{{refn|Italy also became an operator of a &quot;Harrier Carrier&quot;, but they only operated the second-generation [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II]].&lt;ref name= Nordeen_98&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Spain's purchase of Harriers was complicated by long-standing political friction between the British and Spanish governments of the era; even though the Harriers were manufactured in the UK they were sold to Spain with the US acting as an intermediary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2fojAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fX4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6676,3947999&amp;dq=arms+sale+to+spain+irks+wilson&amp;hl=en &quot;Arms Sale to Spain Irks Wilson&quot;.] ''The New York Times'', 22 August 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  During tests in November 1972, the British pilot John Farley showed that the wooden deck of ''Daedalus'' was able to withstand the temperature of the gases generated by the Harrier.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  Since 1976, the Spanish Navy operated the AV-8S Matador from their aircraft carrier {{ship|Spanish aircraft carrier|Dédalo||2}} (formerly the {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|6}}); the aircraft provided both air defence and strike capabilities for the Spanish fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain later purchased five Harriers directly from the British government to replace losses.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_48-9&gt;Jenkins 1998, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawker Siddeley aggressively marketed the Harrier for export. At one point the company was holding talks with Australia, Brazil, Switzerland, India and Japan. Of these only India became a customer, purchasing the Sea Harrier.&lt;ref&gt;''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', Vol. 99, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; At one point China came very close to becoming an operator of the first generation Harrier. Following an overture by the UK in the early 1970s, when relations with the West were warming, China became interested in the aircraft as it sought to modernise its armed forces; British [[Prime Minister]] [[James Callaghan]] noted significant hostility from the USSR over the sales bid.&lt;ref&gt;Haddon, Katherine.
