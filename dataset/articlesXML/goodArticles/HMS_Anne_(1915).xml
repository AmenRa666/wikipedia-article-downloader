'''HMS ''Anne''''' was a [[seaplane carrier]] of the [[Royal Navy]] used during [[World War I]]. Converted from the captured German freighter ''Aenne Rickmers'', the ship's two aircraft conducted [[aerial reconnaissance]], observation and bombing missions in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]] during 1915–17 even though the ship was not [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the Royal Navy until mid-1915. She was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in late 1917 and became a [[Merchant Navy]] [[Collier (ship)|collier]] for the last year of the war. ''Anne'' was sold off in 1922 and had a succession of owners and names until she was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1958.

==Description==
''Anne'' was {{convert|367|ft|1|in|m}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|47|ft|7|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|27|ft|3|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=l0/&gt; She was rated at {{GRT|4,083|disp=long}}. The ship had one propeller shaft powered by one [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engine]] that used steam generated by an unknown number of coal-fired [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s. ''Anne'' had a maximum speed of {{convert|11|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner and Gray, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The merchant ship SS ''Aenne Rickmers'' was built by [[Rickmers Reederei|Rickmers]] of [[Bremerhaven]] in 1911. On the outbreak of war in August 1914, she was seized whilst in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]] and was requisitioned for service under the [[Red Ensign]] of the British [[Merchant Marine]] in January 1915 to operate [[seaplanes]].&lt;ref name=l0/&gt; No special modifications were made to the ship; the aircraft were stowed on the aft hatch covers and handled with her cargo booms.&lt;ref name=tc7&gt;Turncoat Carriers, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aenne Rickmers'' operated two French [[Nieuport]] [[floatplane]]s that had been off-loaded by the {{ship|French seaplane carrier|Foudre}}; they were flown by French pilots with British observers.&lt;ref name=l0&gt;Layman, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first two months of 1915, the ship and her aircraft supported  [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Allied operations in Syria, Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula]]. Aside from reconnaissance duties, they delivered and recovered Allied agents as well as observed for ships performing [[naval bombardment|coastal bombardments]]. On 4 March, ''Aenne Rickmers'' was ordered to join several Allied ships that were going to bombard [[Smyrna]], Turkey. A week later, she was torpedoed by the Turkish [[torpedo boat]] ''Demir Hisar''. The ship was hit by one [[torpedo]] in the Number 1 [[cargo hold]]; this was full of timber which limited water ingress and saved her from sinking. ''Aenne Rickmers'' arrived at [[Moudros|Mudros]] the following day to begin repairs, but the repair crew was withdrawn a week later to work on the damaged [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|6}}. The seaplane carrier {{HMS|Raven II||6}} (another merchant conversion) arrived on 20 March to load her aircraft and crew, leaving only a five-person skeleton crew behind. During a storm on 6 April, the ship dragged her anchors and ran aground on a sandy beach. She was temporarily repaired there and refloated on 12 May, sailing to [[Alexandria]], Egypt two days later for permanent repairs and to off-load her cargo. This was completed by 18 June, but the ship lay idle until the end of the month when she was provided with an Arab crew and sailed to [[Port Said]].&lt;ref name=tc7/&gt;

''Aenne Rickmers'' rendezvoused with the French [[armoured cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Jeanne d'Arc|1899|2}} on 18 July at [[Scarpanto]] and the carrier searched the Turkish coast for [[U-boat]] bases and observed while the French ship bombarded coastal installations. The ship then returned to Port Said where she was fitted with a [[12-pounder gun]]. ''Aenne Rickmers'' was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 5 August 1915&lt;ref name=tc7/&gt; and renamed HMS ''Anne'' the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge and Warlow, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; She rendezvoused with ''Jeanne d{{'}}Arc'' and the French [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jauréguiberry||2}} around 13 August and observed while they bombarded Turkish installations in [[Haifa]]. On 17 August, aircraft from both ''Anne'' and ''Raven II'' spotted for ''Jeanne d{{'}}Arc'' as she bombarded [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] and then assisted ''Jeanne d{{'}}Arc'' and ''Jauréguiberry'' on 30 August as they captured [[Ruad Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Turncoat Carriers, pp. 287, 289&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September, the ship assisted the French as they evacuated [[Armenia]]n troops and civilians from [[Alexandretta]] and the surrounding area and then resumed her earlier work of reconnaissance and espionage. ''Anne'' lost her first aircraft when it suffered an engine failure whilst on a reconnaissance mission over [[Beersheba]] on 9 October. The ship had her bottom cleaned in Alexandria during November and lost another aircraft, again over Beersheba, on 22 December. In January 1916, she was assigned to the [[East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron]] together with the carriers {{HMS|Empress|1914|2}}, {{HMS|Ben-my-Chree||2}} and ''Raven II''. The squadron was under the command of the [[General Officer Commanding]], Egypt and its primary duty was to watch Turkish positions and movements in southern Palestine and the Sinai in early 1916. Around 17 April, ''Anne'' was attacked by two German aircraft, but was not damaged. A few days later, she discovered a U-boat base at Makry, whilst operating near [[Kastellorizo]]. The ship loaded aboard the French seaplane contingent in Egypt at the end of the month, and delivered it to [[Malta]] on 9 May for transfer, including her own Nieuports, to the {{ship|French seaplane carrier|Campinas}}. Her aircraft had made a total of 118 flights since she began operating them in January 1915 and only two had been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Turncoat Carriers, pp. 289–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, ''Anne'' exchanged her existing 12-pounder for an [[anti-aircraft gun]] of the same calibre&lt;ref name=l0/&gt; and was back at Port Said by 21 May. She lay idle there until mid-June when she began transporting military supplies between Port Said and several ports in the [[Red Sea]]. This lasted until 2 August when she embarked British seaplanes,&lt;ref&gt;Turncoat Carriers, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Short Type 184]], [[Sopwith Schneider]] and [[Sopwith Baby|Baby]] floatplanes,&lt;ref name=l1/&gt; and she observed for the {{ship|French cruiser|Pothuau}} on 10 August as the latter ship bombarded [[Mersina]]. The East Indies and Egypt Squadron reassembled in late August with ''Raven II'', ''Anne'' and ''Ben-my-Chree'' and the aircraft from the three carriers attacked the Turkish supply dump at [[El Afule]] for thirty minutes. The squadron then steamed south along the Palestinian coast where they encountered two Turkish supply [[dhow]]s. One was sunk by the escorting {{ship|French destroyer|Arbalete}} while the other was captured. The squadron flew off seven aircraft that attacked an encampment at [[Bureir]] and a nearby railroad [[viaduct]]. One of ''Anne''{{'}}s seaplanes was lost during this mission and the pilot was captured. Despite the loss, her aircraft bombed Turkish installations at Tull Keram, [[Nablus]], [[Lod|Ludd]] and [[Ramleh]] before returning to Port Said on 27 August.&lt;ref&gt;Turncoat Carriers, pp. 290–91&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later, ''Anne'' replaced ''Raven II'', after that ship had been damaged by an air attack on 1 September, on an expedition into the Red Sea to support the [[Arab Revolt]] against the Turks. She rendezvoused with the elderly cruiser {{HMS|Fox|1893|6}} and [[HMIS Dufferin|''Dufferin'']] of the [[Royal Indian Marine]] (RIM) and they arrived at [[Rabigh]] on 9 September. The ship briefly ran aground off [[Yenbo]], but got off and was able to observe for ''Fox'' and ''Hardinge'' of the RIM as they shelled Turkish positions near [[Wejh]] on 13 September. Aside one brief visit to [[Suez]] to recoal, ''Anne'' remained in the area while her aircraft flew bombing and reconnaissance missions until she was relieved by ''Raven II'' on 26 October. The ship was idle at Port Said for the rest of the year other than one trip to [[Cyprus]] transporting coal. In January 1917, ''Anne'' returned to the Red Sea and joined ''Hardinge'' and the [[Armed boarding steamer]] ''Suva''. Together with some 500 Arabs, the crews of the three ships made an [[amphibious landing]] and captured Wejh. The ship returned to Suez on 27 January and seems to have been used only as a collier&lt;ref&gt;Turncoat Carriers, pp. 291–92&lt;/ref&gt; until she was paid off on 8 August.&lt;ref name=l1&gt;Layman, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial service===
''Anne'' served as a [[Collier (ship)|collier]] under the Red Ensign from 29 January 1918 until the end of the war under the management of F. C. Strick and Co.&lt;ref name=l1/&gt; She was sold in 1922 to S.N. Vlassopoulos of Greece and was renamed ''Ithaki''. The ship was sold to a Romanian company in 1939 and renamed ''Moldova''; she was then transferred to Panamanian registry in 1942 with the same name. ''Moldova'' was sold in 1949 to Wallem &amp; Co. and renamed ''Jagharat'' in 1954. She resumed her former name of ''Moldova'' in 1955 and arrived at Hong Kong to be scrapped on 8 November 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Turncoat Carriers, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;
