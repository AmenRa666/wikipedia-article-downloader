==Moved from [[Military reserves]] article==

&lt;code&gt;The [[Military of the United States|United States military]] has an extensive reserve system.  When a soldier, sailor, marine, airman, coast guardsman, or merchant mariner is discharged from the military, they often choose to enlist in the reserves.  This allows them to return to civilian life. 
They must commit to, and attend, regular though not terribly time-consuming training.  They must also commit to serving in active duty if their unit is called to war.  In exchange for this commitment and work, they are paid.  

&lt;code&gt;This system has benefits for both the military and the servicemember.

&lt;code&gt;All the branches of the military have reserves.
&lt;code&gt;* [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]]
&lt;code&gt;* [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Navy Reserve]] (formerly known as the U.S. Naval Reserve) [http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/04/20050429-9.html]
&lt;code&gt;* [[United States Marine Corps Reserve|U.S. Marine Corps Reserve]]
&lt;code&gt;* [[Air Force Reserve Command|U.S. Air Force Reserve]]
&lt;code&gt;* [[United States Coast Guard Reserve|U.S. Coast Guard Reserve]]
&lt;code&gt;* U.S. Merchant Marines Reserve

&lt;code&gt;In the U.S., the reserve sytem is different from the [[United States National Guard|National Guards]], which are affiliated with state governments as well as the federal government.&lt;/code&gt; 

Feel free to integrate any of the above with this article. [[User:El C|El_C]] 13:37, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

==Other countries have a reserve too==

This article focuses on the US only. [[User:Yonidebest|Yonidebest]] 20:03, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

I agree. this article should be specific to USA only... can we edit the title... because this is getting confused with other stubs/articles like [[Reserve force]], [[Military reserve]] and [[Army reserves]]. these need consolidation and title change. How about &quot;United States Military Reserve&quot;??? [[User:Knowsitallnot|Knowsitallnot]] 07:36, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

==Moved Yet Again==

I moved this article from United States Military Reserve to here to ensure that the article's title reflects the subject matter, which are the reserve components.  However, instead of moving it back to the original reserve component page, I placed it here and derived the title from the language of 10 USC 10101.  Now the article has a title that both reflects its subject and is country-specific to the United States. [[User:Preuninger|Preuninger]] 17:21, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

==Orphaned blurb==
This text contributed by [[user:MCG]] has been deleted from [[Military reserve]] and looks like it would belong here.  However it is not too comprehensible and needs significant copyediting before it can be used:

In the [[United States]], the Reserves forces such as the qunit mission profile (e.g. Many 'Military Police' trained ''regular reserve units'' and '[[United States National Guard|National Guard]] units' were mobilized during the [[Iraq war]], as were units specializing in supply, transport, engineering, et al.) These various volunteer manned units are always 'on call' and referred to as ''the [[Ready Reserves of the United States|ready reserve]]s'' but might be augmented by the [[Inactive Reserve]]s in time of dire emergency or total war under the United States model&amp;mdash; the inactive reserve is composed of all former serving members of any of the U.S. Armed Forces of military age. Individuals in this class are former members of the regular and ready reserve forces, that have opted to discontinue service in any of those organized bodys; in general, the inactive reserves are not an organized force, but a resource of trained manpower that can be mobilized similar to calling up a levy but in theory with the training of a militia. Individuals in the inactive reserves with specialized talents are from time to time also recalled into service, albeit rarely.

==Component category==

I have removed this article from [[:Category:Components]], because it doesn't seem to belong there. If a category is required at all, it should be one that groups military organizations together, not one that mixes military organizations with automobile parts. --[[User:RichardVeryard|RichardVeryard]] 09:54, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

==Reserve Components and the Merchant Marine?==

Sorry, but the Merchant Marine is not a Reserve Component of the Armed Forces.  While it is true that upon graduation from the U. S. Merchant Marine Academy the newly minted Merchant Marine officer incurs a 8 year obligation as a Navy Reserve officer (or another reserve component), there is no Merchant Marine Reserve, as such.  The individual officer is a member of the Navy Reserve. It is not a civilian auxillary of the Navy and never was; the Merchant Marine works very closely with the Navy during peacetime as well as in war.  This article warrants changing to correct serveral errors in copy.   [[User:Cuprum17|Cuprum17]] ([[User talk:Cuprum17|talk]]) 21:22, 14 September 2008 (UTC)


==Missing Basic Information==

We're missing some basic information. I'll use the information card (or whatever it's called) on the right from the [[National Guard of the United States]] as criteria.
How long has it been active?
How big is it?
Does it have a motto?

Can someone please find out these?

==Law authorizes moblizing reservists to respond to natural disasters==

Worth a mention here? [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 14:06, 21 May 2012 (UTC)

== This is an excellent article: Thank you! ==

This is an excellent article that has proved very helpful to me as I seek to better understand the Guard and Reserves for my job and for other Wikipedia articles. Thank you to all of you who have contributed to this top-notch Wikipedia entry. - [[User:Markworthen|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:DarkSlateBlue&quot;&gt;Mark D Worthen PsyD&lt;/span&gt;''']] 04:34, 13 August 2014 (UTC)

== Who is Matt Kapatinatis and why do we care what his opinion is? ==

Maybe it's someone you folk in the U.S. know about but I doubt it because googling hasn't turned up any information that isn't derived from this article.

I don't have a problem with him or his opinion being cited; I just think it needs covering on what basis we should consider him someone who should be listened to.  He's just introduced into the beginning of the article out of the blue with no background information on him.
