== Assessment ==

This article overuses quotations. It is not a good idea to quote someone that explains the battle, the battle should be explained by the wikipedia text itself, using the quoted text as a reference. The 4º quote left an open quotation mark, and the following sentence has a period inside the quotation marks that should be outside.

The mentioned portrait &quot;The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj&quot;, when was it painted? Most, but not all, of Lady Butler's works are from before 1923, and may be available for the {{tl|PD-US-1923-abroad}} licence. [[User:Cambalachero|Cambalachero]] ([[User talk:Cambalachero|talk]]) 03:23, 16 February 2012 (UTC)
:Yes incorporated quotes into text, apart from one which gives an idea of what they went through. There are two copies of the painting online, that I could find. One print in the museum that has a 2004 copywrite tag, presumably taken from the original, that they own. Another print for sale by Cranson Fine Art, I'm not sure of the copywrite here. They are also selling copies of the Defence of Rorkes Drift, which was commissioned by Queen Victoria and is still in the royal collection. So they do not own it, and Butlers works are freely available, most gallerys in the UK have at least one for sale.

== Strength ==

Tha article states 
:''The only mounted troops in the area were 170 [[yeomanry]] - two full [[squadron (army)|squadron]]s and two half squadrons from the [[Worcestershire Yeomanry|Worcestershire]] and [[Warwickshire Yeomanry]]''
Really?  170 troops equated to a single squadron in the British Army at this time.  Even allowing for attrition... [[User:Hamish59|Hamish59]] ([[User talk:Hamish59|talk]]) 11:44, 26 March 2013 (UTC)

== Edit waring ==

This post has been moved from RoslynSKP's talk page as it relates to this article.

Your edits to [[Charge at Huj]] have been reverted again. There is a [[WP:CONSENSUS]] at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history#Ottoman Turkish Empire wording dispute]] as you well know to use '''Turkish where context is clearly in favour of this term''' not just in one article as you are claiming. Turkish was the original wording not Ottoman which you changed it to. [[User:Jim Sweeney|Jim Sweeney]] ([[User talk:Jim Sweeney|talk]]) 01:06, 27 November 2013 (UTC)

:That consensus was quite clearly to do with one article - it did not and does not relate to any other article on Wikipedia. This is confirmed by the agreement on the [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]] that status quo ante bellum would apply. --[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 01:14, 27 November 2013 (UTC)
::In that case why are you editing not only against consensus but against the [[status quo ante bellum]] changing Turkish to Ottoman. Turkish was used first, when the article was created and you changed it to Ottoman yesterday. [[User:Jim Sweeney|Jim Sweeney]] ([[User talk:Jim Sweeney|talk]]) 03:14, 27 November 2013 (UTC)

Roslyn; Just a note that you've made 3 reverts at [[Charge at Huj]] in the past 24-hours and to be careful not to breach [[WP:3RR]].

== Ottoman Turkish ==

As there appears to have been a consensus reached I have restored this edit - see [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history#Arbitrary break]]. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 09:07, 27 November 2013 (UTC)
:That consensus related only to the dispute at [[Talk:Anzac Mounted Division]]. No other articles were mentioned. --[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 01:02, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
::Firstly, the ANI discussion here: [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive256#Moving_forward.3F]] did not make any such decision, you and Jim merely agreed to discuss the issues on the talk page in question. Secondly, the consensus reached here [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Military_history#Arbitrary_break]] clearly post dates the ANI thread so the issues have now moved on since then. There was majority support at a project level in that discussion that the term “Turkish” was not derogatory or POV due to its use in the majority of reliable sources. As I see it there is no requirement to discuss issues of terminology on ever single page that they are used on where such consensus exists. What policy are you basing your disregard for [[WP:3RR]] by continuing to make these changes? On the surface this looks to me like disruptive editing. Surely it would be easier just to move on and focus on writing articles? [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 02:04, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
::: The consensus sanctions &quot;continuing use of 'Turkish' where context is clearly in favor of the term.&quot; Are you suggesting that simply adding AustralianRupert's note gives that context? --[[User:RoslynSKP|Rskp]] ([[User talk:RoslynSKP|talk]]) 05:36, 4 December 2013 (UTC)
::::No by using the sources. [[User:Jim Sweeney|Jim Sweeney]] ([[User talk:Jim Sweeney|talk]]) 07:22, 4 December 2013 (UTC)</text>
