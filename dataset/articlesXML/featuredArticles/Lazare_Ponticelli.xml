'''Lazare Ponticelli''' (born Lazzaro Ponticelli, 24 December 1897, later mistranscribed as 7 December &lt;!-- Ponticelli's date of birth, according to the civil registry, was 7 December 1897, although this is likely to be a mistake. It was probably recorded as 27 December 1897 in the registry and the &quot;2&quot; was eroded. Ponticelli's mother remembered giving birth on 24 December (Christmas Eve) and that a snowstorm had delayed any exit from the house for three days --&gt; – 12 March 2008), [[Order of Vittorio Veneto|Knight of Vittorio Veneto]], was at 110, the last surviving officially recognized veteran of the [[First World War]] from France and the last ''[[poilu]]'' of its trenches to die.{{efn|In June 2008, three months after Ponticelli's death, [[Fernand Goux]] was discovered to be a French veteran. However, Goux was not officially recognized as a [[poilu]], or foot soldier, even though he was called up for service on 19 April, since he was only in the trenches from 3 November 1918 to the signing of the [[armistice]] on 11 November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2008/06/19/460271-Le-dernier-Poilu-de-14-18-n-est-pas-mort.html|title=Le dernier Poilu de 14–18 n'est pas mort|date=19 June 2008|work=Ladepeche.fr|language=French|accessdate=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Picault survived Goux by less than two weeks, but himself was an artilleryman who served less than three months, and is likewise not recognized by the French government as an &quot;official&quot; WWI veteran.}} 

Born in Italy, he travelled on his own to France at the age of eight. Aged 16, he lied about his age in order to join the [[French Army]] at the start of the war in 1914, before being transferred against his will to the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]] the following year. After the war, he and his brothers founded the piping and metal work company ''Ponticelli Frères'' (Ponticelli Brothers), which produced supplies for the [[Second World War]] effort and as of 2009 was still in business.

Ponticelli was the oldest living man of Italian birth and the oldest man living in France at the time of his death. Every [[Armistice Day]] until 2007 he attended ceremonies honoring deceased veterans. In his later years, he criticized war, and stored his awards from the First World War in a shoe box. While he felt unworthy of the state funeral the French government offered him, he eventually accepted one. However, he asked that the procession emphasise the common soldiers who died on the battlefield. French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] honored his wish and dedicated a plaque to them at the procession.

==Early life==
Born as '''Lazzaro Ponticelli''' in Groppo Ducale, a [[frazione]] (civil parish) in [[Bettola]], [[province of Piacenza|Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna]], in northern Italy,&lt;ref name=tim&gt;{{cite news|date=13 March 2008|title=Lazare Ponticelli: Veteran who fought for France and Italy in the First World War|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3540707.ece|work=The Times|accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was raised in the mountain [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of I Cordani, one of seven children born to Jean and Philomène Ponticelli. His father sold livestock on the fairgrounds and occasionally worked as a carpenter and cobbler.&lt;ref name=exp&gt;{{cite news|first=Boris|last=Thiolay|date=12 March 2008|title=Le der des ders|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/info/france/dossier/guerre1418/dossier.asp?ida=464772|work=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]|language=French|accessdate=26 March 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128145244/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/france/dossier/guerre1418/dossier.asp?ida=464772|archivedate=28 January 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His mother cultivated the family's small plot of land and, like many women of the area, commuted three times a year to the [[Po Valley]] to work in its rice fields.&lt;ref name=tim/&gt; Despite the Ponticelli family's hard work, they were impoverished and the children often went to bed on an empty stomach.&lt;ref name=&quot;lazaredernier&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/lefigaromagazine/2008/01/26/01006-20080126ARTFIG00634-lazare-le-dernier-des-poilus.php|title=Lazare, le dernier des poilus|last=Hofstein|first=Cyril|date=29 January 2008|work=Le Figaro|accessdate=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lazare was two years of age, his mother moved to France to earn a better living. After the unexpected deaths of Jean Ponticelli and his eldest son, Pierre, the rest of the family moved to Paris, leaving Lazare in the care of neighbors.&lt;ref name=exp/&gt;

At age six, Ponticelli started several jobs, including making clogs.&lt;ref name=soir&gt;{{cite news|language=French|first=Alain|last=Vincenot|date=13 March 2008|title=Lazare Ponticelli&amp;nbsp;— C'était le dernier poilu|url=http://archive.francesoir.fr/actualite/societe/lazare-ponticelli-c’etait-dernier-poilu-24629.html|work=[[France Soir]]|accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1906, aged eight years old, he had saved enough money to buy a railway ticket to Paris, which he considered &quot;paradise.&quot;&lt;ref name=tim/&gt;&lt;ref name=exp/&gt;&lt;ref name=soir/&gt; To travel to the capital of France, he walked {{convert|21|mi|km|0}} to the nearest train station at [[Piacenza]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abclast&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-12-1835095907_x.htm|title=Last French WWI Veteran Dies|last=Pirot|first=Laurent|date=12 March 2008|agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He could not speak French, but found work as a chimney sweep in [[Nogent-sur-Marne]] and later as a [[paper boy]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=tim/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|date=12 March 2008|title=France's final WWI veteran dies|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7292109.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iht&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Kantner|date=12 March 2008|title= Lazare Ponticelli, 110, last 'poilu' of World War I trenches|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/12/europe/veteran.php|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a work permit at age 13.&lt;ref name=exp/&gt;

==World War I==
In August 1914, aged 16, shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]], Ponticelli was assigned to the [[4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment]] of the [[French Foreign Legion]]. He had lied about his age to enlist. He rediscovered his older brother, Céleste Ponticelli, who had joined the same regiment.&lt;ref name=tim/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; According to Ponticelli, France had done much for him, and serving was his way of showing his gratitude.&lt;ref name=exp/&gt; He served at [[Soissons]] in Picardy, northeast France, and at [[Douaumont]], near [[Verdun]].&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|date=14 March 2008|title=Lazare Ponticelli, 110; France's last surviving World War I veteran|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/14/local/me-ponticelli14|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news|title=Last French World War I Veteran Dies at 110|url=http://www.nysun.com/national/last-french-world-war-i-veteran-dies-at-110/72831/|agency=Associated Press|work=[[The New York Sun]]|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=19 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping a promise to Céleste to always assist others, he rescued a German and a French soldier who were wounded in the arm and leg, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;metro&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metrofrance.com/fr/article/2007/11/11/08/3743-38|title=Un Poilu témoigne|date=11 November 2007|work=Metro France|accessdate=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ponticelli was not a French citizen and in May 1915, when Italy entered the war, he was conscripted into the [[Italian Army]]. Although he attempted to remain with his French regiment, he eventually enlisted in the [[3rd Alpini Regiment|3rd Alpini]] Regiment, after being escorted to [[Turin]] by two [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmes]].&lt;ref name=exp/&gt; Ponticelli saw service against the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] at Mount Piccolo on the Austria–Italy border.&lt;ref name=&quot;metro&quot;/&gt; At his new post as a machine gunner, Ponticelli was seriously wounded by a shell during an assault on an Austrian mountain position. He was returned to his post after rest and recuperation in [[Naples]].&lt;ref name=tim/&gt; In an undated interview, he described being injured: &quot;''Blood was running into my eyes... I continued firing despite my wound.&quot;''&lt;ref name=iht/&gt;

Once, his regiment ceased fighting the Austrians for three weeks. The armies, who mostly spoke each other's tongue, swapped loaves of bread for tobacco and photographed each other.&lt;ref name=eco&gt;{{cite news|date=19 March 2008|title=Lazare Ponticelli|url=http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10875719|work=The Economist|accessdate=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 Ponticelli was gassed in an Austrian attack that killed hundreds of his fellow soldiers.&lt;ref name=tim/&gt; Reflecting on war, he said: ''&quot;You shoot at men who are fathers. War is completely stupid.&quot;''&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=eco/&gt; In one of his last interviews, Ponticelli stated he was amazed at his own survival.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news|first=Lisa|last=Millar|date=18 March 2008|title=France honours last WWI veteran|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/18/2193155.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ponticelli Frères==
[[File:Ponticelli bros.jpg|thumb|right|The &quot;Ponticelli Brothers&quot;.]]
After being demobilized in 1920, Ponticelli founded a metal work company with Céleste and Bonfils, his youngest brother, which they called &quot;Ponticelli Frères&quot; (&quot;Ponticelli Brothers&quot;).&lt;ref name=exp/&gt; Located in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]], it became profitable and well known in its field.&lt;ref name=tim/&gt; It was incorporated as a private limited company in 1932, when its primary work was with industrial chimneys.&lt;ref name=freres&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ponticelli.com/UK/historique.htm|title=History|year=2002|work=Ponticelli Frères|accessdate=12 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324184050/http://www.ponticelli.com/UK/historique.htm|archivedate=24 March 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Second World War]], Ponticelli, who became a French citizen in 1939, was too old for combat but supported the war effort by supplying soldiers with his products.&lt;ref name=tim/&gt;&lt;ref name=exp/&gt; He moved his factory into an unoccupied zone when Germany invaded and occupied France. After [[Vichy France]] was taken over by the Germans, he returned northwards and began working with the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].&lt;ref name=tim/&gt; In the aftermath of World War II, he added a piping department to his company.&lt;ref name=freres/&gt; He continued managing the company until his retirement in 1960.&lt;ref name=tim/&gt; At the time of his death it was reported that the company had 4,000&amp;nbsp;employees&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; and its annual revenue (2005) was €300 million. The company now operates in several countries outside France, such as Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avmaroc.com/dossiers/lazare-derniers-a2705.html|title=Lazare, l'un des derniers poilus, &quot;porte le souvenir&quot; de ses camarades|date=11 November 2006|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Dossiers News|language=French|accessdate=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Lazare Ponticelli 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Lazare Ponticelli (center) between two reenactment members in old uniforms in 2006]]
Until his death, Ponticelli lived with his daughter in the Paris suburb of [[Le Kremlin-Bicêtre]], and every 11 November until 2007 he attended [[Armistice Day]] ceremonies.&lt;ref name=tim/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; An honored citizen of his adopted town, Ponticelli voted in the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential]] and [[French legislative election, 2007|legislative elections]].&lt;ref name=exp/&gt; He officially became a [[supercentenarian]] on 24 December 2007, celebrating his official 110th birthday at the National History of Immigration Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:TLWB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=11DAA565D706B6E0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=WWI veteran turns 110|date=17 December 2007|work=[[Tulsa World]]|publisher=[[NewsBank]]|page=A6|accessdate=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept his war medals in a shoebox.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

When originally offered a state funeral by then French President [[Jacques Chirac]], Ponticelli asserted that he did not want one, although the death of the penultimate recognized soldier,{{Ref|art6|[b]}} [[Louis de Cazenave]], on 20 January 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=France's oldest WW1 veteran dies|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7199127.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=20 January 2008|accessdate=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused him to reconsider.&lt;ref name=iht/&gt; He eventually accepted a small ceremony &quot;in the name of all those who died, men and women,&quot;&lt;ref name=iht/&gt; during World War I.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;
