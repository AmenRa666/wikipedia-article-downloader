The '''Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II''' is a family of single-seat, single-engine, all-weather [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole fighters]] undergoing final development and testing for the United States and partner nations. The [[Fifth-generation jet fighter|fifth generation]] combat aircraft is designed to perform [[attack aircraft|ground attack]] and [[aerial warfare|air defense]] missions. The F-35 has three main models: the F-35A [[CTOL|conventional takeoff and landing]] (CTOL) variant, the F-35B [[STOVL|short take-off and vertical-landing]] (STOVL) variant, and the F-35C carrier-based [[CATOBAR|Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery]] (CATOBAR) variant. On 31 July 2015, the first squadron of F-35B fighters was declared ready for deployment after intensive testing by the United States Marines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3980838/marines-f-35-fighter-jet/ |work=Time |first=Dan |last=Kedmey |title=New F-35 Fighter Jets Are Ready for Combat |date=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/marines-say-costly-f-35-jet-fighter-is-finally-ready-1438367615 |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Doug |last=Cameron |title=Marines Say Costly F-35 Jet Fighter Is Finally Ready |date=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2016, the U.S. Air Force declared its first squadron of F-35A fighters as combat-ready.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/story/breaking-news/2016/08/02/f35-ioc-air-force-operational-acc-combat/87948142/ |work=AirForceTimes |first=Valerie |last=Insinna |title=Air Force Declares F-35A Ready for Combat |date=2 August 2016}} {{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-35 is descended from the [[Lockheed Martin X-35|X-35]], which was the winning design of the [[Joint Strike Fighter program|Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF) program. It is being designed and built by an aerospace industry team led by [[Lockheed Martin]]. Other major F-35 industry partners include [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] and [[BAE Systems]]. The F-35 took its first flight on 15 December 2006. The United States plans to buy 2,457 aircraft. The F-35 variants are intended to provide the bulk of the manned tactical airpower of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], [[United States Navy|Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] over the coming decades. Deliveries of the F-35 for the U.S. military are scheduled to be completed in 2037&lt;ref name=&quot;C4WDefault-981679&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/12/17/air-force-seeks-jets-beyond-c17-and-even-jsf.html |title=Air Force Seeks Jets Beyond C-17 and Even JSF |work=military.com |date=17 December 2013 |publisher=Military Advantage |accessdate=24 May 2014&lt;!--Citation updated, but not verified against text.

===JSF program requirements and selection===
{{Main article|Joint Strike Fighter program}}

The JSF program was designed to replace the United States military [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]], [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] (excluding newer [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|E/F &quot;Super Hornet&quot;]] variants) and [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8B]] tactical fighter and attack aircraft. To keep development, production, and operating costs down, a common design was planned in three variants that share 80 percent of their parts:{{update after|2015|4|4}}&lt;!-- article needs updating: having a goal of keeping costs down, and actually doing so in the event, are quite different things.

George Standridge, Vice President of Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, predicted in 2006 that the F-35 would be four times more effective than legacy fighters in air-to-air combat, eight times more effective in air-to-ground combat, and three times more effective in reconnaissance and [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]] – while having better range and requiring less logistics support and having around the same procurement costs (if development costs are ignored) as legacy fighters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Lockheed_Martin_F22_and_F35_5th_Gen_Revolution_In_Military_Aviation.html &quot;Lockheed Martin F22 and F35 5th Gen Revolution In Military Aviation.&quot;] ''Space Daily'', 22 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The design goals call for the F-35 to be the premier strike aircraft through 2040 and to be second only to the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22 Raptor]] in [[air supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/f-35.htm &quot;F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Lightning II.&quot;] ''Global Security''. Retrieved: 7 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The JSF development contract was signed on 16 November 1996, and the contract for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) was awarded on 26 October 2001 to Lockheed Martin, whose [[Lockheed Martin X-35|X-35]] beat the [[Boeing X-32]]. Although both aircraft met or exceeded requirements, the X-35 design was considered to have less risk and more growth potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keijsper 2007, p. 119&quot;&gt;Keijsper 2007, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The designation of the new fighter as &quot;F-35&quot; is out-of-sequence with standard [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] aircraft numbering,&lt;ref&gt;Polmar 2005, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; by which it should have been &quot;F-24&quot;. It came as a surprise even to the company, which had been referring to the aircraft in-house by this expected designation.&lt;ref&gt;Parsch, Andreas. [http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/nonstandard-mds.html#_MDS_F35 &quot;Designation Systems.&quot;] ''Designation Systems'', 27 April 2006. Retrieved 23 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the F-35 is unusual for a fighter aircraft in that no two-seat trainer versions have been built for any of the variants; advanced flight simulators mean that no trainer versions were deemed necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Mark. &quot;The Most Expensive Weapon Ever Built.&quot; ''Time'' magazine, 25 February 2013, pp. 26–30 (lack of 2-seat trainer variants cited on p. 27).&lt;/ref&gt; Instead F-16s have been used as bridge trainers between the T-38 and the F-35. The [[T-X program|T-X]] was intended to be used to train future F-35 pilots, but this might succumb to budget pressures in the USAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Orlando |first= Dave |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-may-not-be-able-to-afford-t-x-jet-trainer-project-382628/ |title= USAF may not be able to afford T-X jet trainer project |website= Flightglobal |date= 22 February 2013 |accessdate= 24 February 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130227063720/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-may-not-be-able-to-afford-t-x-jet-trainer-project-382628/ |archivedate= 27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design phase===
Based on wind tunnel testing, Lockheed Martin slightly enlarged its X-35 design into the F-35. The forward fuselage is {{convert|5|in|mm|sigfig=2}} longer to make room for avionics. Correspondingly, the horizontal [[stabilator]]s were moved {{convert|2|in|mm|sigfig=2}} rearward to retain balance and control. The top surface of the fuselage was raised by {{convert|1|in|mm|sigfig=2}} along the center line. Also, it was decided to increase the size of the F-35B STOVL variant's weapons bay to be common with the other two variants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keijsper 2007, p. 119&quot;/&gt; Manufacturing of parts for the first F-35 prototype [[airframe]] began in November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Keijsper 2007, pp. 122, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the X-35 did not have weapons bays, their addition in the F-35 would cause design changes which would lead to later weight problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.codeonemagazine.com/f35_article.html?item_id=28 |website= Code One Magazine |publisher= Lockheed Martin |title= X to F: F-35 Lightning II And Its X-35 Predecessors |first= Eric |last= Hehs |date= 15 May 2008 |accessdate= 18 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/outgoing-f-35-programme-boss-shares-hard-won-lessons-383932/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020012508/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/outgoing-f-35-programme-boss-shares-hard-won-lessons-383932/|title=Outgoing F-35 programme boss shares hard won lessons|archivedate=20 October 2013|work=flightglobal.com|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-35B STOVL variant was in danger of missing performance requirements in 2004 because it weighed too much; reportedly, by {{convert|2200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} or 8&amp;nbsp;percent. In response, Lockheed Martin added engine thrust and thinned airframe members; reduced the size of the common weapons bay and vertical stabilizers; re-routed some thrust from the roll-post outlets to the main nozzle; and redesigned the wing-mate joint, portions of the electrical system, and the portion of the aircraft immediately behind the cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;Fulghum, David A. and Robert Wall. &quot;USAF Plans for Fighters Change.&quot; ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', 19 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the changes were applied to all three variants to maintain high levels of commonality. By September 2004, the weight reduction effort had reduced the aircraft's design weight by {{convert|2700|lb|kg|sigfig=2}},&lt;ref&gt;Keijsper 2007, p. 124,&lt;/ref&gt; but the redesign cost $6.2 billion and delayed the project by 18 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;C4WDefault-3831104&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/weight-watchers-13117183/?all |title=Weight Watchers: How a team of engineers and a crash diet saved the Joint Strike Fighter |work=Air &amp; Space Magazine |date=November 2006 |accessdate=1 April 2013 |first=Joe |last=Pappalardo |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.airspacemag.com%2Fmilitary-aviation%2Fweight-watchers-13117183%2F%3Fall&amp;date=2014-05-24 |archivedate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Program cost overruns and delays===
{{Undue weight section|date=May 2015}}

The F-35 program has experienced a number of cost overruns and developmental delays. The program's delays have come under fire from the [[U.S. Congress]] and some [[U.S. Department of Defense]] officials. The program has undergone a number of reassessments and changes since 2006. The [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) warned in March 2006 that excessive concurrency (&quot;an overlap of flight testing and initial production&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.f35.com/about/fast-facts/cost|title = Producing, Operating and Supporting a 5th Generation Fighter|date = |accessdate = November 8, 2015|website = F-35 Lightning II|publisher = Lockheed Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;) might result in expensive refits for several hundred F-35 aircraft that are planned for production before design testing is completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06356.pdf GAO-06-356, &quot;DOD Plans to Enter Production before Testing Demonstrates Acceptable Performance.&quot;] ''GAO'', March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, acquisition chief Ashton Carter issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum restructuring the F-35 program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc31394/m1/1/high_res_d/RL30563_2010Nov10.pdf untitled&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2010, the GAO found that &quot;Managing an extensive, still-maturing global network of suppliers adds another layer of complexity to producing aircraft efficiently and on-time&quot; and that &quot;due to the extensive amount of testing still to be completed, the program could be required to make alterations to its production processes, changes to its supplier base, and costly retrofits to produced and fielded aircraft, if problems are discovered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-233SP?source=ra GAO-11-233SP, &quot;Defense Acquisitions: Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs.&quot;] ''Gao.gov,'' 29 August 2008.

In 2013, a RAND study found that during development, the three different versions had drifted so far apart from each other, that having a single base design might have come to be more expensive than if the three services had simply built entirely different aircraft, each tailored to their own requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/12/17/5426931/report-f-35s-one-jet-apprach-more.html |title=Report: F-35’s one-jet approach more costly for military |last1=Capaccio |first1=Tony |date=17 December 2013 |website= star-telegram.com |publisher=Bloomberg News |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Canadian politicians raised the issue of the safety of the F-35's reliance on a single engine (as opposed to a twin-engine configuration, which provides a backup in case of an engine failure). Canada, and other operators, had previous experience with a high-accident rate with the single-engine [[Lockheed CF-104 Starfighter]] with many accidents related to engine failures. When asked what would happen if the F-35's single engine fails in the [[Northern Canada|Far North]], Defence Minister Peter MacKay  stated &quot;It won’t&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Geoff.

In a negative assessment of the Joint Strike Fighter, the [[think tank]] Air Power Australia declared that the Joint Strike Fighter is not designed to perform air superiority roles and also is not adapted to performing the long-range penetration strike role filled by previous Australian aircraft like the [[General Dynamics F-111C]]. Critically, they also stated that the F-35’s &quot;intended survivability and lethality are mismatched against the operational environment in which the aircraft is intended to be used.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ausairpower.net/jsf.html|title=Joint Strike Fighter|author = Goon, Peter |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Australia's Air Vice Marshal Osley responded to Air Power Australia's criticisms by saying &quot;Air Power Australia (Kopp and Goon) claim that the F-35 will not be competitive in 2020 and that Air Power Australia's criticisms mainly center around F-35's aerodynamic performance and stealth capabilities.&quot; Osley continued with, &quot;these are inconsistent with years of detailed analysis that has been undertaken by Defence, the JSF program office, Lockheed Martin, the U.S. services and the eight other partner nations. While aircraft developments, such as the [[Sukhoi PAK FA|Russian PAK-FA]] or the [[Chengdu J-20|Chinese J20]], as argued by Airpower Australia, show that threats we could potentially face are becoming increasingly sophisticated, there is nothing new regarding development of these aircraft to change Defence's assessment.&quot; He then said that he thinks that the Air Power Australia's &quot;analysis is basically flawed through incorrect assumptions and a lack of knowledge of the classified F-35 performance information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=COMMITTEES;id=committees%2Fcommjnt%2F2dbe833f-6e45-4a8a-b615-8745dd6f148e%2F0001;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Fcommjnt%2F2dbe833f-6e45-4a8a-b615-8745dd6f148e%2F0000%22 &quot;Department of Defence annual report 2010–1.&quot;] ''ParlInfo – Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade,'' 16 March 2012.

The acceleration performance of all three variants was also downgraded, with the F-35C taking 43 seconds longer than an F-16 to accelerate from Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.2; this was judged by several fighter pilots to be a lower performance level than expected from a fourth generation fighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/reduced-f-35-performance-specifications-may-have-significant-operational-impact-381683/ |title=Reduced F-35 performance specifications may have significant operational impact |work=Flight International |date=30 January 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 2013, it was reported that the F-35B and F-35C models take several complex maneuvers in order to &quot;accelerate&quot; to their top speed of Mach 1.6, which consumed almost all of the onboard fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flightglobal.rbiblogs.co.uk/the-dewline/2013/08/f-35b-sea-trials-aboard-the-uss-wasp/|title=F-35B sea-trials aboard the USS Wasp.|work=The DEW Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; The F-35 program office is reconsidering addition of previously removed safety equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Capaccio |first=Tony |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-07/pentagon-mulls-restoring-f-35-safety-gear-to-reduce-risk.html |title=Pentagon Mulls Restoring F-35 Safety Gear to Reduce Risk. |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Lockheed Martin program manager Tom Burbage said that while the relatively large cross-sectional area of the fighter that was required by the internal weapons bays gave it a disadvantage against fourth generation fighters that were operating in a clean configuration, the F-35 armed with weapons carried internally had the advantage over fighters carrying their weapons outside the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120118/DEFREG02/301180013/F-35-May-Miss-Acceleration-Goal|title=F-35 May Miss Acceleration Goal.|work=Defense News}}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 Pentagon report found these issues:
* First two mission data sets available November 2015, after USMC IOC.
* Overall operational suitability relies heavily on contractor support and unacceptable workarounds. 
* Aircraft availability reached 51% but short of 60% goal.
* Fuel Tanks don't retain inerting for required 12 hours after landing. 
* High dynamic loads on the rudder at lower altitudes in 20–26 AoA preventing testing.
* 82 pounds added to F-35B in last 38 months, 337 pounds below limit. 
* Transonic Roll-Off (TRO) and airframe buffet continue to be program concerns. 
* 572 deficiencies remain affecting Block 2B capability, 151 of which are critical.
* VSim would likely not support planned Block 2B operational testing in 2015.
* Maintainability hours still an issue.
* ALIS requires many manual workarounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;osd.mil&quot;/&gt;

A 2015 Pentagon report found these issues:&lt;ref name=&quot;pogo12MAR-15&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/weapons/2015/not-ready-for-prime-time.html |title='DOT&amp;E Report: The F-35 Is Not Ready for IOC and Won't Be Any Time Soon’ |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=12 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314141102/http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/weapons/2015/not-ready-for-prime-time.html |archivedate=14 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Joint Program Office is re-categorizing or failing to count aircraft failures to try to boost maintainability and reliability statistics;
* Testing is continuing to reveal the need for more tests, but the majority of the fixes and for capability deficiencies being discovered are being deferred to later blocks rather than being resolved;
* The F-35 has a significant risk of fire due to extensive fuel tank vulnerability, lightning vulnerability, and its OBIGGS system's inability to sufficiently reduce fire-sustaining oxygen, despite redesigns;
* Wing drop concerns are still not resolved after six years, and may only be mitigated or solved at the expense of combat maneuverability and stealth;
* The June engine problems are seriously impeding or preventing the completion of key test points, including ensuring that the F-35B delivered to the Marine Corps for IOC meets critical safety requirements; no redesign, schedule, or cost estimate for a long-term fix has been defined yet, thereby further impeding g testing;
* Even in its third iteration, the F-35’s helmet continues to show high false-alarm rates and computer stability concerns, seriously reducing pilots’ situational awareness and endangering their lives in combat;
* The number of Block 2B’s already limited combat capabilities being deferred to later blocks means that the Marine Corps’ FY2015 IOC squadron will be even less combat capable than originally planned;
* ALIS software failures continue to impede operation, mission planning, and maintenance of the F-35, forcing the Services to be overly reliant on contractors and &quot;unacceptable workarounds&quot;;
* Deficiencies in Block 2B software, and deferring those capabilities to later blocks, is undermining combat suitability for all three variants of the F-35;
* The program’s attempts to save money now by reducing test points and deferring crucial combat capabilities will result in costly retrofits and fixes later down the line, creating a future unaffordable bow wave that, based on F-22 experience, will add at least an additional $67 billion in acquisition costs; and
* Low availability and reliability of the F-35 is driven by inherent design problems that are only becoming more obvious and difficult to fix.

Three different types of data &quot;massaging&quot; are identified in the DOT&amp;E report:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2014/pdf/dod/2014f35jsf.pdf |title= 'FY 2014 Programs: F-35 Joint Strike Fighter’ |date=20 January 2015|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving failures from one category to another, less important one; ignoring repetitive failures, thus inflating numbers of failure-free hours; and improper scoring of reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/release/160298/f_35-program-massages-flight-test-results.html|title= 'F-35 Program Massages Flight Test Results’ |date=19 January 2015|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance problems were determined to be so severe that the F-35 is only able to fly twice a week. To address the issue of wing drop and buffet maneuvering, the required control law modifications will reduce the maneuverability of the F-35, &quot;only exacerbating the plane’s performance problems in this area&quot;. The F-35C's wing drop problem is &quot;worse than other variants&quot;. Testing to investigate the impact of buffet and transonic roll-off (TRO or &quot;wing drop&quot;) on the helmet-mounted display and offensive and defensive maneuvering found that &quot;buffet affected display symbology, and would have the greatest impact in scenarios where a pilot was maneuvering to defeat a missile shot.&quot; Buffeting also degrades the gyroscopes in the inertial platforms which are essential for flight control, navigation, and weapons aiming. DOT&amp;E explained that this was an ongoing issue: &quot;In heavy buffet conditions, which occur between 20 and 26 degrees angle of attack, faults occurred in the inertial measurement units (IMUs) in the aircraft that degraded the flight control system (two of three flight control channels become disabled), requiring a flight abort.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/weapons/2015/not-ready-for-prime-time.html |title=Not Ready for Prime Time |work=Project On Government Oversight |accessdate=11 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611025543/http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/weapons/2015/not-ready-for-prime-time.html? |archivedate=11 June 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015 the AF-2 F-35A, the primary flight sciences loads and flutter evaluation aircraft, was flown by Lockheed Martin F-35 site lead test pilot David &quot;Doc&quot; Nelson in air-to-air combat maneuvers against F-16s for the first time and, based on the results of these and earlier flight-envelope evaluations, said the aircraft can be cleared for greater agility as a growth option. AF-2 was the first F-35 to be flown to 9g+ and −3g, and to roll at design-load factor. Departure/spin resistance was also proven during high angle-of-attack (AOA) testing which eventually went as high as 110 deg. AOA. &quot;When we did the first dogfight in January, they said, ‘you have no limits,’&quot; says Nelson. &quot;It was loads monitoring, so they could tell if we ever broke something. It was a confidence builder for the rest of the fleet because there is no real difference structurally between AF-2 and the rest of the airplanes.&quot; &quot;Pilots really like maneuverability, and the fact that the aircraft recovers so well from a departure allows us to say [to the designers of the flight control system laws], ‘you don’t have to clamp down so tight,’&quot; says Nelson.&lt;ref name=&quot;aviationweek.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/defense/f-35-flies-against-f-16-basic-fighter-maneuvers|title=F-35 Tested Against F-16 In Basic Fighter Maneuvers – Defense content from Aviation Week|work=aviationweek.com|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the full flight envelope now opened to an altitude of 50,000 ft, speeds of Mach 1.6/700 KCAS and loads of 9 g, test pilots also say improvements to the flight control system have rendered the transonic roll-off (TRO) issue tactically irrelevant. Highlighted as a &quot;program concern&quot; in the Defense Department’s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) 2014 report, initial flight tests showed that all three F-35 variants experienced some form of wing drop in high-speed turns associated with asymmetrical movements of shock waves. However, TRO &quot;has evolved into a non-factor,&quot; says Nelson, who likens the effect to a momentary &quot;tug&quot; on one shoulder harness. &quot;You have to pull high-g to even find it.&quot; The roll-off phenomena exhibits itself as &quot;less than 10 deg./sec. for a fraction of a second. We have been looking for a task it affects and we can’t find one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aviationweek.com&quot;/&gt;

In the report's conclusions and recommendations it was noted that loads remained below limits, which implied there may be more maneuverability available to the airframe. There were five recommendations made: to increase pitch rate and available Nz (Normal Acceleration g) to provide the pilot with more maneuverability options given the inherent energy deficit; consider increasing alpha onset to also help offset the energy maneuverability deficit; consider increasing the beginning of the high AoA blended region to 30 degrees or greater to make high AoA maneuvering more predictable and intuitive; consider increasing pilot yaw rate to remove the gradual sluggish yaw response; and improve HMD Boresight performance to account for dynamic maneuvers and consider improving rearward visibility by creating more space for helmet motion.&lt;ref name=F-35-F-16_report/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1029/1*Cvd15pTLP_xPYJDRQ-Tgxw.png&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2016 the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) released a report on the $16.7 billion Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) which expressed concerns that a failure in the logistics system, which serves as the &quot;brains&quot; of the F-35, could potentially ground the entire fleet because it lacked a back-up for processing data. ALIS supports everything from the plane's operations, pilot scheduling, mission planning and supply chain management to maintenance; it is therefore one of the three major components of the jet, along with the airframe and engine. GAO said one of the biggest concerns raised by 120 F-35 pilots, maintenance staff, contractors and program officials interviewed for the report was the lack of a redundant system for processing ALIS data. GAO noted &quot;DOD is aware of risks that could affect ALIS but does not have a plan to prioritize and address them in a holistic manner to ensure that ALIS is fully functional as the F-35 program approaches key milestones – including Air Force and Navy initial operational capability declarations in 2016 and 2018, respectively, and the start of the program’s full-rate production in 2019&quot;. A Pentagon-commissioned study from 2013 concluded that any delays or problems with ALIS could add $20 billion to the F-35 program cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lockheed-fighter-idUSL2N17H0ZM |publisher=Reuters |title=Risks seen with Lockheed's F-35 fighter logistics |date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/676576.pdf |title=F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: DOD needs a plan to address risks related to its Central Logistics System |date=14 April 2016 |publisher=GAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Flightglobal reported that new Block 3i software was finally installed, improving reliability over earlier Block 3 software. With early Block 3 software, it was reported that aircraft had to be shut down and rebooted or a sensor or radar reset &quot;every 4 hours&quot;, which was considered an &quot;unacceptable&quot; rate. According to Flightglobal, &quot;F-35 programme director Lt Gen Christopher Bogdan told Congress...that a failure rate of once every 8-10h or greater would be more acceptable, and recent fixes now seem to have achieved that goal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/f-35-locked-and-loaded-with-improved-block-3i-softwa-425098/|title = F-35 locked and loaded with improved Block 3i software|accessdate = 18 May 2016|last = Drew|first = James|date = 9 May 2016| work = [[Flight Global]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pentagon−Lockheed Martin relation issues===
In September 2012, the Pentagon criticized, quite publicly, Lockheed Martin's performance on the F-35 program and stated that it would not bail out the program again if problems with the plane's systems, particularly the [[helmet-mounted display]], were not resolved. The deputy F-35 program manager said that the government's relationship with the company was the &quot;worst I've ever seen&quot; in many years of working on complex acquisition programs. Air Force Secretary Michael Donley told reporters the Pentagon had no more money to pour into the program after three costly restructurings in recent years. He said the department was done with major restructuring and that there was no further flexibility or tolerance for that approach. This criticism followed a &quot;very painful&quot; 7 September review that focused on an array of ongoing program challenges. Lockheed Martin responded with a brief statement saying it would continue to work with the F-35 program office to deliver the new fighter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/18/us-lockheed-fighter-idUSBRE88H00D20120918 &quot;Pentagon Tells Lockheed to Shape Up on F-35 Fighter.&quot;] ''Reuters.com'', 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2012, the Pentagon announced that the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter support program would become an open competition. They invited companies to participate in a two-day forum on 14–15 November for possible opportunities to compete for work managing the supply chain of the aircraft. Their reason is to reduce F-35 life-cycle costs by creating competition within the program and to refine its acquisition strategy and evaluate alternatives that will deliver the best value, long-term F-35 sustainment solution. This could be hazardous to Lockheed Martin, the current prime contractor for sustainment of all three variants, and selection of another company could reduce their revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-lockheed-fighterbre88r1k1-20120928,0,519683.story &quot;Pentagon seeks competition for sustainment of Lockheed F-35.&quot;]{{dead link|date=July 2016}} ''Chicago Tribune'', 28 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the officer in charge of the program blamed Lockheed Martin and Pratt &amp; Whitney for gouging the government on costs, instead of focusing on the long-term future of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-27/pentagon-escalates-rhetoric-against-lockheed-over-f-35.html|title=Pentagon Escalates Rhetoric Against Lockheed Over F-35.|date=28 February 2013|work=Bloomberg|first=David|last=Lerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Lockheed was reported to be having problems with build quality, including one aircraft with a valve installed backwards and another with gaps in the stealth coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/f-35-joint-strike-fighter-60-minutes/ |title=Is the F-35 worth it? |last1=Martin |first1=David |date=16 February 2014 |website= cbsnews.com |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upgrades===
Lockheed Martin's development roadmap extends until 2021, including a Block 6 engine improvement in 2019. The aircraft are expected to be upgraded throughout their operational lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;C4WDefault-3968485&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/10/30/michael-byers-stewart-webb-on-the-f-35-the-plane-that-keeps-on-billing/ |title=Michael Byers &amp; Stewart Webb on the F-35: The plane that keeps on billing |work=fullcomment.nationalpost.com |date=30 October 2012 |accessdate=20 April 2014 |first1=Michael |last1=Byers |first2=Stewart |last2=Webb |publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420221110/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/10/30/michael-byers-stewart-webb-on-the-f-35-the-plane-that-keeps-on-billing/ |archivedate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, [[Northrop Grumman]] revealed the development of a company-funded [[Directional Infrared Counter Measures]] system in anticipation of a requirement to protect the F-35 from heat-seeking missiles. A laser jammer is expected to be part of the F-35 Block 5 upgrade; it must meet low-observability (LO) requirements and fit in the F-35's restricted space. Called the Threat Nullification Defensive Resource (ThNDR), it is to have a small, powerful laser, beam steering and LO window, use liquid cooling, and fit alongside the distributed aperture system (DAS) to provide spherical coverage with minimal changes; the DAS would provide missile warning and cue the jam head.&lt;ref name=&quot;C4WDefault-1497789&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article/PrintArticle.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_09_12_2013_p0-615904.xml&amp;p=1&amp;printView=true |title=Northrop Develops Laser Missile Jammer For F-35 |work=aviationweek.com |others=Image credit:Northrop Grumman |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=20 April 2014 |first=Graham |last=Warwick |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420220645/http://www.aviationweek.com/Article/PrintArticle.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_09_12_2013_p0-615904.xml&amp;p=1&amp;printView=true |archivedate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combat capabilities of the F-35 are made possible through software increments to advance technical abilities.  Block 2A software enhanced simulated weapons, data link capabilities, and early fused sensor integration.  Block 2B software enables the F-35 to provide basic close air support with certain JDAMs and the 500&amp;nbsp;lb [[GBU-12 Paveway II]], as well as fire the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]].  The Air Force is to declare the F-35 initially operational with Block 3i software.  Full operational capability will come from Block 3F software; Block 3F enhances its ability to suppress enemy air defenses and enables the Lightning II to deploy the 500&amp;nbsp;lb JDAM, the [[GBU-53/B|GBU-53/B SDB II]], and the [[AIM-9X|AIM-9X Sidewinder]].  Block 4 software will increase the weapons envelope of the F-35 and is made to counter air defenses envisioned to be encountered past the 2040s.  Block 4 upgrades will be broken into two increments; Block 4A in 2021 and Block 4B in 2023.  This phase will also include usage of weaponry unique to [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Turkey|Turkish]], and other European countries who will operate Lightning II.&lt;ref name=&quot;C4WDefault-4541962&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defensetech.org/2014/04/16/pentagon-develops-f-35s-4th-generation-software/ |title=Pentagon Develops F-35’s 4th Generation Software |work=defensetech.org |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=20 April 2014 |first=Kris |last=Osborn |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420220036/http://defensetech.org/2014/04/16/pentagon-develops-f-35s-4th-generation-software/ |archivedate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-35 resembles a smaller, single-engine sibling of the twin-engine [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]] and drew elements from it. The exhaust duct design was inspired by the [[General Dynamics]] Model 200 design, proposed for a 1972 supersonic [[VTOL]] fighter requirement for the [[Sea Control Ship]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Vertiflight&quot;. ''Journal of the American Helicopter Society'', January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Although several experimental designs have been developed since the 1960s, such as the unsuccessful [[Rockwell XFV-12]], the F-35B is to be the first operational supersonic, STOVL stealth fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, John R. and Chris Geisel. &quot;F-35 STOVL supersonic.&quot; lockheedmartin.com.

The Air Force plans to use the F-35A to primarily take up the [[close air support]] (CAS) mission in contested environments.

In October 2013, development of the alternate helmet was halted. The current Gen 2 helmet is expected to meet the requirements to declare, in July 2015, that the F-35 has obtained initial operational capability. Beginning in 2016 with low rate initial production (LRIP) lot 7, the program will introduce a Gen 3 helmet that features an improved night vision camera, new liquid crystal displays, automated alignment and other software enhancements.&lt;ref name=&quot;C4WDefault-3692597&quot;/&gt;

In July 2015, an F-35 pilot commented that the helmet may have been one of the issues that the F-35 faced while dogfighting against an F-16 during a test; &quot;The helmet was too large for the space inside the canopy to adequately see behind the aircraft. There were multiple occasions when the bandit would've been visible (not blocked by the seat) but the helmet prevented getting in a position to see him (behind the high side of the seat, around the inside of the seat, or high near the lift vector).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/damning-report-on-f-35s-dogfighting-problems-2015-7|title=Damning report on F-35's dogfighting problems – Business Insider|date=2 July 2015|work=Business Insider|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance===
The program's maintenance concept is for any F-35 to be maintained in any F-35 maintenance facility and that all F-35 parts in all bases will be globally tracked and shared as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sldinfo.com/?p=18843 &quot;F-35, Maintenance and the Challenge of Service Standardization.&quot;] ''Second Line of Defense'', 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonality between the different variants has allowed the USMC to create their first aircraft maintenance Field Training Detachment to directly apply the lessons of the USAF to their F-35 maintenance operations.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Dan. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2012/07/mil-120727-afns01.htm &quot;F-35 maintenance training spawns USMC's first air FTD.&quot;] ''USMC'', 27 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft has been designed for ease of maintenance, with 95% of all field replaceable parts &quot;one deep&quot; where nothing else has to be removed to get to the part in question. For instance the ejection seat can be replaced without removing the canopy, the use of low-maintenance [[electro-hydrostatic actuator]]s instead of hydraulic systems and an all-composite skin without the fragile coatings found on earlier stealth aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Colin. [http://defense.aol.com/2011/11/03/why-lockheed-thinks-f-35-beats-boeings-f-18/ &quot;Why Lockheed Thinks F-35 Beats Boeing's F-18.&quot;] ''Aol Defense'', 3 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-35 Joint Program Office has stated that the aircraft has received good reviews from pilots and maintainers, suggesting it is performing better than its predecessors did at a similar stage of development, and that the stealth type has proved relatively stable from a maintenance standpoint. This reported improvement is attributed to better maintenance training, as F-35 maintainers have received far more extensive instruction at this early stage of the program than on the [[F-22 Raptor]]. The F-35's stealth coatings are much easier to work with than those used on the Raptor. Cure times for coating repairs are lower and many of the fasteners and access panels are not coated, further reducing the workload for maintenance crews. Some of the F-35's radar-absorbent materials are baked into the jet's composite skin, which means its stealthy signature is not easily degraded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-air-force-praises-early-performance-of-lockheed-martin-f-35-378578/ &quot;US Air Force praises early performance of Lockheed Martin F-35.&quot;]''Flightglobal.com'', 6 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is still harder to maintain (because of the need to preserve its stealth characteristics) than fourth-generation aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, Dave.

Retrieved 1 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[DOT&amp;E]] Report on the F-35 program published in January 2015 determined that the plane has not, in fact, reached any of the nine reliability measures the program was supposed to achieve by this point in its development and that the Joint Program Office has been re-categorizing failure incidents to make the plane look more reliable than it actually is. Further, the complexity of maintaining the F-35 means that, currently, none of the Services are ready to keep it in working order and instead &quot;rely heavily on contractor support and unacceptable workarounds.&quot; DOT&amp;E found that the program achieved 61 percent of planned flight hours and that the average rate of availability was as low as 28 percent for the F-35A and 33 percent for the F-35B. The program created a new &quot;modeled achievable&quot; flight hour projection &quot;since low availability was preventing the full use of bed-down plan flight hours.&quot; According to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management, in FY2014, each non-test F-35 flew only 7.7 hours per month, which amounts to approximately one sortie every 5.5 days—for combat purposes, a sortie rate so low as to be crippling. Mean flight hours between removal (MFHBR) have increased, but are still only 59 percent to 65 percent of the required threshold. DOT&amp;E found that mean corrective maintenance time for critical failures got worse for the F-35A and the F-35C over the last year. Structural cracking is also proving to be a recurring and enduring problem that is not yet resolved.&lt;ref name=&quot;pogo12MAR-15&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2014/pdf/dod/2014f35jsf.pdf | title=FY 2014 Programs: F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) |date=15 January 2015 | publisher=The Office of The Director, Operational Test And Evaluation (DOT&amp;E)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2015, the U.S. Air Education and Training Command Accident Investigation Board reported that catastrophic engine failure had led to the destruction of an Air Force F-35A assigned to the 58th Fighter Squadron at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida, on 23 June 2014.  The third-stage forward integral arm of a rotor had fractured and broke free during the takeoff roll. Pieces cut through the engine's fan case, engine bay, internal fuel tank and hydraulic and fuel lines before leaving through the aircraft's upper fuselage. Leaked fuel and hydraulic fluid ignited the fire, which destroyed the rear two-thirds of the aircraft. The destruction of the airframe resulted in the cancelation of the F-35's international debut at the 2014 [[Farnborough Airshow]] in England, the temporary grounding of the F-35 fleet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/story/military/2015/06/05/air-force-investigation-june-2014-f35-fire/28535269/ | title=AF investigation: Catastrophic engine failure caused F-35 fire | publisher=Airforce News | date=5 June 2015 | accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ongoing restrictions in the flight envelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Majumdar|first1=Dave|last2=Kjelgaard|first2=Chris|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/f-35-needs-bigger-more-powerful-engine-12491|title=F-35 Needs a Bigger, More Powerful Engine|work=The National Interest|date=27 March 2015|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an internal memo, Gilmore concluded &quot;the exercise was so flawed that it 'was not an operational test … in either a formal or informal sense of the term.' Furthermore, the test 'did not—and could not—demonstrate' that the version of the F-35 that was evaluated 'is ready for real-world operational deployments, given the way the event was structured.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/09/15/pentagon-weapons-tester-calls-f-35-evaluation-into-question|title=Pentagon weapons tester calls F-35 evaluation into question|author=Christian Davenport|date=15 September 2015|work=Washington Post|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2016 the Joint Program Office confirmed that the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] (RNLAF) had cleared its [[KDC-10]] aerial tanker to refuel the F-35, paving the way for the fighter’s international public debut at the RNLAF’s Open Dagen (Open Day) at Leeuwarden on June 10–11, 2016.

==Variants==
[[File:F-35 A B C Config.png|thumb|Configuration of the three original F-35 variants]]

The F-35 is being built in three different main versions to suit various combat missions.

===F-35A===
The F-35A is the conventional takeoff and landing ([[CTOL]]) variant intended for the U.S. Air Force and other air forces. It is the smallest, lightest F-35 version and is the only variant equipped with an internal cannon, the [[GAU-12 Equalizer#GAU-22/A|GAU-22/A]]. This [[25 mm caliber|25&amp;nbsp;mm]] cannon is a development of the [[GAU-12 Equalizer|GAU-12]] carried by the USMC's [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier II]]. It is designed for increased effectiveness against ground targets compared to the [[20 mm caliber|20 mm]] [[M61 Vulcan]] cannon carried by other USAF fighters.

The F-35A is expected to match the F-16 in maneuverability and instantaneous high-g performance, and outperform it in stealth, payload, range on internal fuel, avionics, operational effectiveness, supportability, and survivability.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, John.

The A variant is primarily intended to replace the USAF's [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]]. At one point it was also intended to replace the [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Thunderbolt II]] starting in 2028.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, Adam J.

On 27 January 2014, General [[Gilmary M. Hostage III|Mike Hostage]], head of [[Air Combat Command]], stated he would fight &quot;to the death&quot; to not have a single plane of the USAF's planned 1,763 F-35 purchase be cut, because the allies and partners of the US got &quot;weak in the knees&quot; when seeing the USAF &quot;back away&quot; from the F-35. He said the F-15 and F-16 fleets would become tactically obsolete in the middle of the next decade regardless of improvements. Hostage also commented that the F-35 would be &quot;irrelevant&quot; without the F-22 fleet being viable as the F-35 was not an air superiority fighter,&lt;ref name=&quot;C4Wauto-41390&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/article/20140202/NEWS04/302020005/Air-Combat-Command-s-challenge-Buy-new-modernize-older-aircraft |title=Air Combat Command's challenge: Buy new or modernize older aircraft |work=airforcetimes.com |date=2 February 2014 |accessdate=22 March 2014 |first=Aaron |last=Mehta |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.airforcetimes.com%2Farticle%2F20140202%2FNEWS04%2F302020005%2FAir-Combat-Command-s-challenge-Buy-new-modernize-older-aircraft&amp;date=2014-03-22 |archivedate=22 March 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that an F-35 pilot who enters a dogfight has made a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2014/06/gen-mike-hostage-on-the-f-35-no-growlers-needed-when-war-starts/ |title= Gen.

The F-35B is the short takeoff and vertical landing ([[STOVL]]) variant of the aircraft. Similar in size to the A variant, the B sacrifices about a third of the A variant's fuel volume to accommodate the [[Rolls-Royce LiftSystem|vertical flight system]].

The U.S Marine Corps plans to disperse its F-35Bs among forward deployed bases to enhance survivability while remaining close to a battlespace, similar to RAF Harrier deployment late in the Cold War which relied on the use of off-base locations that offered short runways, shelter, and concealment.  Known as distributed STOVL operations (DSO), Marine F-35Bs would sustain operations from temporary bases in allied territory within the range of hostile ballistic and cruise missiles, but be moved between temporary locations inside the enemy's 24- to 48-hour targeting cycle.  This strategy accounts for the F-35B's short range, the shortest of the three variants, with mobile forward arming and refueling points (M-Farps) accommodating [[KC-130]] and [[MV-22 Osprey]] aircraft to rearm and refuel the jets, as well as littoral areas for sea links of mobile distribution sites on land.  M-Farps could be based on small airfields, multi-lane roads, or damaged main bases, while F-35Bs would return to U.S. Navy ships, rear-area U.S. Air Force bases, or friendly carriers for scheduled maintenance; metal planking would be needed to protect unprepared roads from the F-35B's engine exhaust, which would be moved between sites by helicopters, and the Marines are studying lighter and more heat-resistant products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/defense/marines-propose-rapidly-mobile-f-35-operations Marines Propose Rapidly Mobile F-35 Operations] – Aviationweek.com, 16 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the F-35A, the F-35C carrier variant features larger wings with [[Folding wing|foldable wingtip sections]], larger wing and tail control surfaces for improved low-speed control, stronger landing gear for the stresses of [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] arrested landings, a twin-wheel nose gear, and a stronger [[tailhook]] for use with carrier [[arrestor cable]]s. The larger wing area allows for decreased landing speed while increasing both range and payload.

The U.S. Navy may use the F-35C as part of its [[UCLASS]] effort to operate a carrier-based [[unmanned aerial vehicle]].  Though it has been suggested that the UCLASS could carry air-to-air weapons, an unmanned aircraft lacks situational awareness and is more vulnerable to electronic countermeasures than manned aircraft, and autonomy for deploying lethal weapons is not under development.  With the F-35C as the center of a network of naval systems, it could feed information to the UCLASS and order it to fire on a certain target.  Large numbers of F-35Cs operating in contested environments can generate a clear picture of the battlespace, and share it with unmanned assets that can be directed to attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;C4WDefault-9738121&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/01/uavs-and-the-f-35-partners-in-air-power/ |title=UAVs and the F-35: Partners in Air Power? |work=thediplomat.com |date=3 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2014&lt;!--Citation updated, but not verified against text.

==Accidents==
On 23 June 2014, an F-35A preparing to take off on a training flight at Eglin Air Force Base experienced a fire in the engine area. The pilot escaped unharmed. The accident caused all training to be halted on 25 June, and all flights halted on 3 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Penton Media&quot;/&gt; During the incident investigation, engine parts from the burned aircraft were discovered on the runway, indicating it was a substantial engine failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shalal|first1=Andrea|title=Engine pieces found on runway after F-35 fire – sources|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/27/lockheed-fighter-engine-idUSL2N0P818G20140627|accessdate=2 July 2014|work=Reuters.Com|agency=Reuters|issue=US Edition|publisher=Thomson Reuters|date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet was returned to flight on 15 July with restrictions in the flight envelope.&lt;ref name=&quot;BREAKING: F-35 Cleared For Flight&quot;/&gt; Preliminary findings suggests that excessive rubbing of the engine fan blades created increased stress and wear and eventually resulted in catastrophic failure of the fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140713/SHOWSCOUT15/307130026/Kendall-Fan-Blade-Rubbing-Cause-F-35-Fire|title=Kendall: Fan-Blade Rubbing Cause of F-35 Fire|work=Defense News|accessdate=21 September 2014}}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2015, the USAF Air Education and Training Command (AETC) issued its official report on the incident. It found that the incident was the result of a failure of the third stage rotor of the engine's fan module. The report explained that &quot;pieces of the failed rotor arm cut through the engine's fan case, the engine bay, an internal fuel tank, and hydraulic and fuel lines before exiting through the aircraft's upper fuselage&quot;. Pratt and Whitney, the engine manufacturers, developed two remedies to the problem. The first is an extended &quot;rub-in&quot; to increase the gap between the second stator and the third rotor integral arm seal. The second is the redesign to pre-trench the stator. Both should be complete by early 2016. Cost of the problem was estimated at USD 50 million. All aircraft resumed operations within 25 days of the incident.&lt;ref name=janespentagonreport&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malenic|first1=Marina|title=Pentagon releases report on F-35 engine failure|journal=IHS Janes Defence Weekly|date=17 June 2015|volume=52|issue=24|page=13|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
