==Untitled==
I was a bit surprised to see this bio of my late father on Wikipedia as his name is much more obscure now than it was in his heyday.  I was also surprised to see a glaring, though minor, error at the end of the article.  Even though the opening parenthetical dates of birth and death, as well as those in the sidebar, are correct the penultimate paragraph (just prior to the one sentence last paragraph describing his burial) mysteriously has his date of death as September 15, 1994 which is a full seven months after his actual date of death.  Curious.

I would also like to point out an important omission in the description of his wartime assignments at Los Alamos.  All that is mentioned in the article is that he was Group Leader of the Target, Projectile and Source Group (Group E-4, June 1943 - August 1944.)  While that is true of the initial organization of the Laboratory the important omission here is that when the Laboratory was reorganized Oppenheimer transferred my father to Robert F. Bacher's Gadget Division where he headed up the Initiator Group (Group G-10, August 1944 - August 1945.)  It was that group which succeeded in designing and building the initiator (neutron generator) without which the implosion weapon would not have functioned.

The two organizations of the wartime Los Alamos Laboratory can be seen on an American Institute of Physics webpage at:

== Comment on the GA Review process ==

A few minutes after he started the review, the reviewer made six edits to the article.  In view of the requirement that &quot;Anyone who has not contributed significantly to â€¦ this article may review it&quot;, Is this appropriate?  

Some of these edits are substantive.  For example, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Critchfield&amp;diff=566866802&amp;oldid=566866212 the edit of 15:35, 2 August 2013] incorrectly changes the advisor of Sophie Oleksa from Critchfield to Edward Ney.     [[User:Deer*lake|Deer*lake]] ([[User talk:Deer*lake|talk]]) 19:24, 6 August 2013 (UTC)
:Hi there.  The edit you link to was an error on my part; I misunderstood the sentence in question and thought that Oleksa was one of Critchfield's students and the sentence was poorly worded. I see that it has been fixed now, and I apologize and will make an effort to avoid such mistakes in the future.
:Regarding making edits, I think you'll find the remainder of the edits I made as part of the review process ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Critchfield&amp;diff=566866953&amp;oldid=565887269 diff]) to be minor.  Per [[Wikipedia:Good_article_nominations/Instructions#Step_3:_Reviewing_the_article|GA Review instructions]], reviewers are encouraged to make fixes themselves if issues are minor.  I like doing this because it saves me from having to point every single out typo/wording issue I come across.  
:Also, the reviewer in this case is a 'she'.  Best, '''[[User:Corvus coronoides|&lt;font color=&quot;000000&quot;&gt;Corvus coronoides&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Corvus coronoides|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 19:45, 6 August 2013 (UTC)
:PS you have me confused on the edit in question again.  Who was Oleksa's advisor?  Critchfield, or Ney?  I think my edit changed it to Critchfield from Ney, and assumed that you meant that was incorrect, but you have it the other way around in your comment.  '''[[User:Corvus coronoides|&lt;font color=&quot;000000&quot;&gt;Corvus coronoides&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Corvus coronoides|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 20:16, 6 August 2013 (UTC)</text>
