== Lead Section ==
I have re-written and expanded the lead paragraph. The older version was inadequately written, and the first sentence failed to define the subject of the article (see [[WP:LEADSENTENCE]]). The new Lead mentions, I think, most of the high points of the text. That is, after all, what a lead section should do. See: [[WP:MOSINTRO]]. For a body of text of the present size, the present Lead section is of an appropriate length. See [[WP:LEAD#Length]].

*Thats your personal opinion, the lead section seems to me to completely explain the subject of the article, the other sections contain the appropriate information and are inline with similar articles.

::There are many other comparable articles which are also lacking in the quality of their Lead sections, that doesn't mean we should this one to the same low standard. I'm not sure why you are against the improvement of this article, but at least you are not fighting the single-line definition in the lead, which is an improvement over the previous version which started talking about ''origins'' before informing the reader of ''what he was reading about''.&lt;p&gt;
::On the issue of definition, the actual [[matchlock]] is the ''firing mechanism'' of the weapon; see [[Lock (firearm)]]. Referring to a weapon as matchlock, versus [[wheellock]], or [[flintlock]], is simply a shorthand method of reference. For further explanation, see the article [[arquebus]]. [[User:Boneyard90|Boneyard90]] ([[User talk:Boneyard90|talk]]) 22:42, 11 March 2012 (UTC)

::So I was looking at sources, and I came across the very authoritative book, ''Tanegashima: The Arrival of Europe in Japan'' by Olof Lidin, and it quite plainly refers to the weapons in question as an &quot;arquebus&quot; (pp.4, 157, others), with note that referring to the arquebuses as &quot;matchlocks&quot; is acceptable in English. I was going to put this reference in the article, but I see it's already there. You stated in the edit summary that you don't know of any sources that calls the weapon an arquebus. Perhaps you forgot, or perhaps you did not actually review the source. Do you still have an objection to the term? [[User:Boneyard90|Boneyard90]] ([[User talk:Boneyard90|talk]]) 22:59, 11 March 2012 (UTC)
*Of course not, I do not object to any properly referenced information.[[User:Samuraiantiqueworld|Samuraiantiqueworld]] ([[User talk:Samuraiantiqueworld|talk]]) 23:49, 11 March 2012 (UTC)
*You could also add harquebus and the Japanese term &quot;hinawaju&quot;, the references I have use &quot;matchlock&quot; and tanegashima.  Here is one reason that the term &quot;matchlock&quot; is used, this is from the arquebus article.

&quot;In the early 16th century, the term &quot;arquebus&quot; had a confusing variety of meanings. Some writers used it to denote any matchlock shoulder gun, referring to light versions as caliver and heavier pieces fired from a fork rest as musket. Others treated the arquebus and caliver synonymously, both referring to the lighter, forkless shoulder-fired matchlock. As the 16th century progressed, the term arquebus came to be clearly reserved for the lighter forkless weapon. When the wheel lock was introduced, wheel-lock shoulder arms came to be called arquebuses, while lighter, forkless matchlock and flintlock shoulder weapons continued to be called calivers. In the mid-17th century, the light flintlock versions came to be called fusils or fuzees&quot;.

:Sure, '''in the 16th century''', it had &quot;a confusing variety of meanings&quot;, but this isn't the 16th century. The term is now used as an inclusive term for those small arms with the various lock mechanisms. From the same article, '''Mechanism''' section: &quot;The arquebus was fired by a matchlock mechanism.&quot; If you look at the photos, all the re-enactors, the arquebusiers, appear to be using matchlock weapons.[[User:Boneyard90|Boneyard90]] ([[User talk:Boneyard90|talk]]) 02:06, 12 March 2012 (UTC)
