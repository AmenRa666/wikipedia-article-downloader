'''HMS ''Nemesis''''' was a 28-gun [[Enterprise class frigate|''Enterprise''-class]] [[sixth-rate]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. The French captured her in 1795 at Smyrna, but in 1796 a squadron led by {{HMS|Barfleur|1768|2}} brought her out of the neutral port of Tunis. Throughout her career she served under a number of commanders who would go on to have distinguished careers. She was converted to a [[troopship]] in 1812 and was sold in 1814.

==British service==
''Nemesis'' was first [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in January 1780 under the command of Captain [[Richard Rodney Bligh]]. ''Nemesis'' was in company with {{HMS|Viper|1781|2}} on 3 January 1781 when they captured the Dutch vessel ''Catherine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=12395|startpage=2|date=7 December 1782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then she captured the French privateer ''Alliance'' on 5 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=12393|startpage=2|date=30 November 1782}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was paid off from wartime service in 1784.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; Lastly, ''Nemesis'' was among the vessels sharing in the proceeds of the capture on 30 March 1783 of the Dutch ship ''Arendt op Zee''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=12737|startpage=133|date=24 March 1786}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was paid off in May 1784 after wartime service.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

Between December 1787 and November 1789 ''Nemesis'' was at Deptford undergoing a major repair. Batson, Limehouse, fitted her for sea between May and September 1790. Captain [[Alexander Ball]] commissioned her in may , but then paid her off in 1792.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==French Revolutionary Wars==

Captain J. Woodey commissioned her in October 1792. He sailed for the Mediterranean on 26 April 1793. By September, ''Nemesis'' was under the command of Captain Lord [[Amelius Beauclerk]].

On 28 and 29 August 1793, a Spanish-British force captured Toulon in the opening act of what would become the [[siege of Toulon]]. They would hold it until December when they would evacuate. ''Nemesis'' was among the vessels sharing in the prize money for the capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15807|startpage=655|date=14 May 1805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] replaced Beauclerk in March 1794.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; ''Nemesis'' was among the many vessels and troops sharing in the proceeds of the capture of [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]], Corsica, on 10 August 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15717|startpage=842|date=7 July 1804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and recapture==
On 9 December 1795, part of [[Honoré Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Gantaume]]'s squadron, consisting of the frigate  [[French frigate Sensible (1788)|''Sensible'']], and the corvettes [[French corvette Sardine (1771)|''Sardine'']] and ''Rossignol'', captured ''Nemesis'', which had grounded and after refloating had anchored out of range of the fort in the neutral port of [[Smyrna]].

According to British accounts, the French warships entered the harbour in disregard of its neutrality and called on ''Nemesis'' to surrender, which she did when the French refused to honour the port's neutrality and fired on her. French accounts, on the other hand, state that a British officer was invited on ''Sensible'' to acknowledge that ''Nemesis'' was outside the protected neutral zone, before ''Sensible'' was called on to surrender, to which her captain agreed after a token shot would be fired.&lt;ref&gt;Troude, vol.2, p.457&lt;/ref&gt; Three men from ''Nemesis'', a sailor and two Royal Marines, defected to the French and joined ''Sardine''.&lt;ref name=Hepper&gt;Hepper (1994), p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 1796, ''Nemesis'' was anchored in the neutral harbour of [[Tunis]], together with ''Sardine'' and ''Postillon''. The British sent a squadron under the command of Vice-Admiral [[William Waldegrave, 1st Baron Radstock|William Waldegrave]] to recapture ''Nemesis''. The ships of the line [[HMS Egmont (1768)|''Egmont'']], [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|''Barfleur'']], [[HMS Bombay Castle (1782)|''Bombay Castle'']], and {{HMS|Zealous|1785|2}}, along with the frigate [[HMS Tartar (1756)|HMS ''Tartar'']] and the [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]] {{HMS|Fox|1794|2}},&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15120|startpage=307|date=30 March 1799}}&lt;/ref&gt; anchored in the bay.&lt;ref name=Troude20&gt;Troude, vol.3, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Ensign Chautard, of ''Némésis'', was invited aboard ''Barfleur'' and informed that diplomatic relations between Tunis and England had been broken, that England would soon declare war on Tunis, and that he would therefore to renounce the neutrality of the harbour. The British then threatened to sink the French ships if they did not strike their colours.&lt;ref name=Troude20 /&gt; Resistance being futile in the face of these overwhelming odds, the French surrendered and boats from the ships of the line took possession of the ships.&lt;ref name=Troude20 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/18-1900/E/01556.html HMS ''Egmont''], Naval Database&lt;/ref&gt;

The British took the three men who had defected from ''Nemesis'' to ''Sardine'' and hanged them.&lt;ref name=Hepper/&gt; The other crew members of the three ships were released ashore. The fourth French vessel, ''Gerfaut'', refused to surrender, preferring to scuttle, and she thrice repelled assaults from the British boats before beaching herself.&lt;ref name=Troude20 /&gt; In the automatic court-martial for the loss of the ships, Ensign Chautard was acquitted due to the disproportion of forces.&lt;ref name=Troude20 /&gt;

Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] sent ''Nemesis'', ''Sardine'', and ''Postillon'' to [[Ajaccio]]. He had ''Postillon'' repaired and painted before selling her to [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|Sir Gilbert Elliot]] the British [[viceroy]] of the [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]], for onward transfer to the '''Dey''' of the [[Ottoman Algeria|Regency of Algiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett (1914-15), p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nemesis'' returned to British service, and ''Sardine'' was brought into the Royal Navy.

==British service again==
Commander John Halliday took command of ''Nemesis'' in April 1796. He then paid her off in September. Between August 1797 and March 1798 ''Nemesis'' was at Portsmouth being fitted out. Captain [[Robert Dudley Oliver]] recommissioned her in February and then sailed her for [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] on 17 April 1798 as escort for a convoy.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

Captain [[Thomas Baker (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Baker]] replaced Oliver in January 1799. On 27 October, ''Nemesis'' recaptured the ''War Onsean''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15233|startpage=188|date=22 February 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, ''Nemesis'' and the [[hired armed vessels|hired armed]] [[lugger]] [[Hired armed lugger Nile|''Nile'']] captured five French fishing vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15278|startpage=848|date=22 July 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 1800 ''Nemesis'' captured the French privateer [[lugger]] ''Renard''. She was armed with fourteen 4-pounder guns and two [[swivel gun]]s, and had a crew of 65 men under the command of Jean Jacque Fourmintin. She had sailed the morning before from Boulogne, in company with six other privateer luggers. In the day she had been out, she had captured the brig ''Atlas'', which had been sailing from Lisbon to Dungeness. {{HMS|Savage|1778|2}} was in company with ''Nemesis''. Baker sent a signal to Captain Thompson of ''Savage'', who then recaptured the brig, which ''Nemesis'' had had to bypass while chasing ''Renard''.&lt;ref name=LG15221/&gt;

Shortly thereafter, ''Nemesis'' sighted two other luggers to leeward. He came up on one, the privateer ''Modere'', just as the hired armed lugger [[Hired armed lugger Nile|''Nile'']] was boarding her.&lt;ref name=LG15221/&gt;

Baker then took the two captured privateers and the recaptured brig in charge. He then escorted them to the Downs, where he arrived at 5am on 13 January. However, before he left, he deployed several British vessels that had arrived to try to intercept either the other privateer luggers, or any vessels that might have been captured from a convoy that {{HMS|Narcissus}} had been escorting up the Channel.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;As there was no ''Narcissus'' in service in 1800, it is not clear to which vessel Baker was referring.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent ''Nile'' to watch Calais and the hired armed cutter [[Hired armed cutter Union|''Union'']], Lieutenant Guyon commanding, to watch Boulogne. He asked Thompson to use his own judgement in deciding on which port to concentrate. During the night ''Nemesis'' encountered the cutter [[Hired armed cutter Stag|''Stag'']] to watch those ports also.&lt;ref name=LG15221&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15221|startpage=37|date=11 January 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 1800 ''Nemesis'' captured the ''Rosette'', which was carrying a cargo of salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15583|startpage=555|date=10 May 1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nemesis'' was among the many British vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the French frigate [[French frigate Désirée (1796)|''Désirée'']], which {{HMS|Dart|1796|2}}, under [[Patrick Campbell (Royal Navy officer)|Patrick Campbell]], captured on 8 July 1800 in the [[Raid on Dunkirk (1800)|Raid on Dunkirk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15297|startpage=1123|date=27 September 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July ''Nemesis'' was part of a squadron that also included {{HMS|Terpsichore|1785|2}}, {{HMS|Prévoyante|1793|2}}, {{HMS|Arrow|1796|2}}, and the hired lugger ''Nile'', when it encountered the Danish frigate [[HDMS Freya (1793)|HDMS ''Freja'']], which was escorting a convoy of two ships, two brigs and two [[galliot]]s.&lt;ref name=NC4/&gt; Baker hailed her and said that he would send a boat to board the convoy. The Danish captain refused, and said that if a boat approached he would fire on it. Baker sent a midshipman and four men in a boat, and the Danes fired several shots, which missed the boat, but one of which killed a man on ''Nemesis''. ''Nemesis'' then opened fire with her broadside. After an engagement of about 25 minutes, ''Freya'', much damaged, [[striking the colours|struck]]. She had suffered eight men killed and many wounded; both ''Nemesis'' and ''Arrow'' each suffered two men killed and several wounded.&lt;ref&gt;''London Chronicle'', 26–29 July 1800, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; The British brought ''Freja'' and her convoy into the Downs on 6 March.&lt;ref name=NC4&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 4, p.157.&lt;/ref&gt; They later released her, and presumably the rest of the convoy. This incident led to strained relations with [[Denmark]], and, in order to anticipate any hostile move from the Danes, the British government despatched [[Charles Whitworth, 1st Earl Whitworth|Earl Whitworth]] in August on a special mission to Copenhagen. The Danes not being ready for war, his mission staved off hostilities for about a year. In 1807, after the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|second battle of Copenhagen]], the British captured ''Freja'' and took her into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Freya''.

Much less momentously, on 27 October, ''Nemesis'' and the lugger ''Nile'' captured five fishing vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In January 1801, ''Nemesis'' was under the command of Captain Edward Owen in the Irish Sea and the Channel. On 7 January she was at anchor at Deal when she suffered the loss of seven of her crew, their boat having overturned as they were returning from a visit to the shore.&lt;ref&gt;Grocott (1997), pp. 104-05&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Phillip Somerville assumed command of ''Nemesis'' in May 1802.

==Napoleonic Wars==

On 22 May 1803, ''Nemesis'' and {{HMS|Révolutionnaire|1794|2}} captured the French brig ''Alexander''.{{#tag:ref|The prize money for petty officers was [[£sd|£]]1 15[[shilling|s]] 5[[pence|d]]; a seaman's share was worth 9s 10d.&lt;ref name=LG15732/&gt;|group=Note}} Six days later, ''Nemesis'' and {{HMS|Sirius|1797|2}} were in company when they captured the French ship ''Mere de Familie''.{{#tag:ref|The prize money for petty officers was £37 7s 11d; a seaman's share was worth £10 17s 5d, or almost six months' wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15673|startpage=181|date=7 February 1804}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} That same day they also shared in the capture of the French ship ''Zephyr''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15799|startpage=544|date=20 April 1805}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of the ''Aigle'' on 30 May resulted in a preliminary allotment to ''Sirius{{'}}''s crew of [[pound sterling|£]]6200 in prize money.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=841|issue=15717|date=7 July 1804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 8 June ''Sirius'' captured the ''Trois Freres''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=366|issue=15686|date=24 March 1804}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sirius'' shared with ''Nemesis'' the proceeds of the capture of the ''Trois Freres'' and the ''Aigle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1299|issue=15746|date=16 October 1804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May, ''Nemesis'' captured the French schooner ''Les Amis''.{{#tag:ref|The prize money for petty officers was £21 5s 6d; a seaman's share was worth £4 17s 5d.&lt;ref name=LG15732&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15732|startpage=732|date=12 June 1804}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

On 3 May 1806, ''Nemesis'' detained the Danish brig ''Bergens Handel''.{{#tag:ref|A petty officer's share of the prize money was worth 12s 10d; a seaman's share was worth 2s 11½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=361|issue=16126|date=8 March 1808}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Somerville then sailed ''Nemesis'' with a convoy for Newfoundland on 29 August.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; She was then at Newfoundland in 1807. She took a convoy to North America on 16 April 1808.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

Captain William Ferris took command in March 1809. Ferris sailed ''Nemesis'' to the Baltic at some point in 1809. On 17 April ''Nemesis'' and {{HMS|Alexandria|1806|2}} captured the Danish vessel ''Nicholette Johanna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1271|issue=16398|date=21 August 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July she captured the Danish vessels ''Dodre'' and ''Forsoget''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1083|issue=16389|date=21 July 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt; A last payment of head money for ''Forsoget'', which was a Danish privateer, was paid in September 1830, by which time Ferris was dead.{{#tag:ref|A first-class share was worth £9 13s 4½d; a sixth-class share was worth 1s 9½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18721|startpage=1837|endpage=1838|date=2y August 1830}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

On 23 July 1810, boats from {{HMS|Belvidera|1809|6}}, Captain [[Richard Byron (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Byron]], and ''Nemesis'' attacked three [[Norwegian Gunships|gun-schooners]] of the Dano-Norwegian Navy. The British captured two 8-gun vessels, the ''Thor'' and ''Balder'', and her crew abandoned a third, smaller gunboat of three guns that the British burnt.  The British report that the Danes lost four men killed while the British sustained no casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1342|issue=16402|date=4 September 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British prize money reckoning refers to three vessels, ''Balder'', ''Thor'' and ''Fortuna''. ''Fortuna'' may have been a merchant vessel seized at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=503|issue=16583|date=14 March 1812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Battle of Silda}}

''Nemesis'' also sailed to the Greenland fishery in 1810. In April 1811 she came under the command of Captain [[William Bowles (Royal Navy officer)|William Bowles]] for the east coast of Africa.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==Troopship==
Between September 1811 and May 1812, ''Nemesis'' was at Sheerness being fitted as a troopship. Commander James Maude commissioned her in February as a 16-gun troopship. She sailed to North America in 1813.

''Nemesis'' was among the British vessels that shared in the capture on 21 June of the American ship ''Herman'', and her cargo.{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the prize money was worth £47 13s 4d; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth 7s 6d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17419|startpage=2051|date=17 November 1818}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

On 11 July 1813, ''Nemesis'' was with [[HMS Romulus|''Romulus'']], [[HMS Fox (1780)|''Fox'']], [[HMS Sceptre (1802)|''Sceptre'']], and {{HMS|Conflict|1812|2}}, and the tenders {{HMS|Highflyer|1813|2}} and {{HMS|Cockchafer|1812|2}}, anchored off the [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke]] bar, in the Outer Banks of [[North Carolina]]. There the boats of the squadron captured the [[brig]], ''Anaconda'', of 18 guns, and a [[privateer]] [[schooner]], the ''Atlas'', of 10 guns. The British took the two prizes into service as {{HMS|Anaconda|1813|2}} and [[HMS St Lawrence (1813)|''St Lawrence'']].{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the prize money for the two was worth £32 3s 2¼d; a sixth-class share was worth 9s 8¼d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18015|startpage=540|date=3 April 1824}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} ''Nemesis'' then sailed north and next appears at Montreal on 31 October as one of six ships that brought two battalions of Royal Marines and two batteries of Royal Marine artillery to Montreal from Halifax to help protect that city after the defeat of the British at the [[Battle of Lake Erie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16828|startpage=2619|date=21 December 1813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 22 December ''Nemesis'' was back in the Channel. On that day she assisted the brig-sloop {{HMS|Helicon|1808|2}} in her chase of a French privateer schooner. ''Helicon'' captured the ''Revenant'' some five [[League (unit)|leagues]] south of the [[Eddystone Lighthouse|Eddystone]]. ''Revenant'' was armed with guns and had a crew of 75 men. She was one day out of [[Saint-Malo]] and had made no captures.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16831|startpage=2677|date=25 December 1813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
''Nemesis'' was paid off in March 1814. She was offered for sale at Plymouth on 9 June 1814,&lt;ref name=LG16902&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16902|startpage=1113|date=28 May 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sold that day for £1,610 on 9 June 1814.&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), p.221.&lt;/ref&gt; As was common with larger ships, the purchaser had to post bond, with two sureties, that he would break up his purchase within a year.&lt;ref name=LG16902/&gt;
