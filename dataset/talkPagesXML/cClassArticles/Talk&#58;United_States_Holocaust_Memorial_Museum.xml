==[[:File:Day119sholocaustf.JPG]]==

This picture was taken within the permanent exhibit at the museum, where photography is strictly prohibited. It is therefore inappropriate to include it within this article and should probably be removed immediately. [[User:Cumulus Clouds|Cumulus Clouds]] 05:04, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

==Palestinian involvement in the Holocaust==

You should provide the proper formatting for the reference, or at least better explain the deletion.[It is factual.  Not neutral because you don't agree with it?]~~68.244.157.66~~ 

:*Well, I'm considering deleting most of that section because it has next to no verifiable references and what little citations it does have are incredibly biased and are completely inappropriate for Wikipedia. This article is not a soapbox to advance the inflammatory and highly controversial opinion that Palestinians had anything to do with the Holocaust. If I don't hear any opposition to it, I'll just take it out completely. [[User:Cumulus Clouds|Cumulus Clouds]] 15:49, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

The action of 'Cumulus', whoever he is, is egregious and astounding in his ignorance.  First, the article said nothing about 'palestinians' - he introduced that as a straw man.  He discounts a respected congressman as an inappropriate source, as he does an established newspaper.  What he discounts as controversial is established fact.  That was the basis of the criticism of the museum that he removed -- for example its refusal to display the documentation that exists, such as a picture of the mufti and Hitler together.  The lack of participation allows him to get a way with this.

::Could I suggest you carefully read [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]; the burden of proof always rests on editors wanting to include material. In this instance, the [[WP:RS|sources]] you provided were considered to be inadequate. Is there any coverage of this criticism in mainstream media, for example [[CNN]] or the [[New York Times]]? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 17:50, 26 July 2007 (UTC)

==Unreferenced info==

In the &quot;See Also&quot; section, I added a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{fact}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template to&lt;br /&gt;&quot;On the first floor of the museum, a model of what the ghettos may have looked like are present. The presented ghetto model is life size.&quot;  First of all, there's plenty of historical evidence as far as what each of the ghettoes look like.  Secondly, I've never seen such a model, and I was there today.  --[[User:Micahbrwn|Micahbrwn]] 21:14, 26 August 2007 (UTC)
:*I think they were referring to the main lobby of the museum, with the brick facades on the wall being made to represent the ghettos. I don't want to speak for him, but that's just what it looks like to me. [[User:Cumulus Clouds|Cumulus Clouds]] 21:35, 25 October 2007 (UTC)

==Criticism of museum==

I'm wondering about the unsourced sentence in this section of the article saying, &quot;The museum has also been criticized for its sole focus on Jews.&quot;  I've been to the museum and distincly remember that other victims of the nazis are included - e.g., people with disabilities and russian POWS.  Also, looking at the website for the museum, there is inclusion of other victims of the nazis.  I have removed this language from the article. [[Special:Contributions/165.189.169.190|165.189.169.190]] ([[User talk:165.189.169.190|talk]]) 20:11, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

After reading the Hass article, I've edited to better reflect what the article says.  It doesn't really criticize the US museum, but rather discusses the concept of universal memory and how this cannot be applied to the holocaust, and how therefore the museums on the holocaust reflect a society's memory of an event and can result in the exploitation of an event. [[Special:Contributions/165.189.169.190|165.189.169.190]] ([[User talk:165.189.169.190|talk]]) 13:27, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

:I know there's some issue about the museum's recognition of Roma/Romani victims before the 1980s, and I think that that's important.  I just don't know enough about the problem to write anything.

==Not one mention of the gas chambers==

in this article there is not one mention of the gas chambers. that was supposed to have been the method by which millions were murdered and not one mention in this article. it should also be mention that there are no photos of the gas chambers on the webpage for the museum. strange isnt it?  &lt;small&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/208.79.15.102|208.79.15.102]] ([[User talk:208.79.15.102|talk]]) 08:33, 7 June 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

i had to create an account just for this talk page alone. i found it very odd that there was no mention of the gas chambers in this article. the museum is dedicated to the Holocaust. and it is claimed that gas chambers were the preferred method of killing the alleged six million jews. but no mention of it in this artice? i think that very odd too. [[User:Notonekilled|Notonekilled]] ([[User talk:Notonekilled|talk]]) 18:26, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

the Wikipedia article on Auschwitz mentions the gas chambers over 20 times. [[User:Notonekilled|Notonekilled]] ([[User talk:Notonekilled|talk]]) 07:06, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

==Don't understand the following==

==Shooting incident==

CNN indicates only two victims; no mention of a third. Should this be removed from the article? --[[Special:Contributions/69.143.169.19|69.143.169.19]] ([[User talk:69.143.169.19|talk]]) 19:01, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
:My understanding at this point is that a security guard was gravely wounded by a bullet from the wannabe terrorist, that the wannabe himself was wounded by a gunshot, and that a 3rd person was treated on the scene for lascerations from broken glass from a source unknown, but presumably from a glass case that was shattered near the person, as part of the altercation that ensued when security moved to control the wannabe.  That terminology, of course, was never used in any of the statements I've heard made to the press. :-p [[User:TShilo12|Tomer]][[User talk:TShilo12|&lt;sup style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:51, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

==why isnt this added? ==

why is there no mention of the gas chambers in this article? and why hasn't someone added it? is there no mention of the gas chambers in the actual museum? are there no exhibits? no replicas, no photographs? i haven't been there so that is why i am asking. [[User:Notonekilled|Notonekilled]] ([[User talk:Notonekilled|talk]]) 09:17, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

: First, the article isn't protected.  Add it in if you want.  Second, if I see anything in your response that indicates even a hint of where I think you're going, I'm blocking you indefinitely.  If you have a serious point, make it.  -- [[User:Ricky81682|Ricky81682]] ([[User talk:Ricky81682|talk]]) 10:09, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

ricky81682 banned me because he is a coward. Notonekilled, as in &quot;not one killed in a gas chamber&quot;.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/91.151.155.100|91.151.155.100]] ([[User talk:91.151.155.100|talk]]) 12:21, 28 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

my serious point is that the entire crux of the Holocaust is that there was a gas chamber program in which millions of human beings were ushered into and gassed with poison gas. and yet the article about the museum dedicated to this program of Nazi murder doesnt have one mention of them. to me its like an article here on Wikipedia about the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum and it not having any mention of the planes that are featured. 

there is no open discussion for revision on the holocaust. one side is revered while the other side is marginalized, fined, deported and imprisoned. that is what the Holocaust has come to? dissent must not be heard? and that, along with many other reasons, is why i believe the holocaust is nothing more than Zionist wartime propaganda. nothing more.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/91.151.155.100|91.151.155.100]] ([[User talk:91.151.155.100|talk]]) 12:43, 28 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: This is an article about a ''museum'' with information on the Holocaust, not about the Holocaust itself. If there were an extensive exhibit with a certain amount of notoriety regarding methods of mass murder, that could be justified as worth mentioning, maybe. However, the actual history of the Holocaust is appropriately discussed on that article and the ones pertaining to the actual sites where the deaths occurred. Furthermore, it should go without saying that a Holocaust museum would have an exhibit about the gas chambers, don't be dense.[[Special:Contributions/65.197.138.113|65.197.138.113]] ([[User talk:65.197.138.113|talk]]) 22:35, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

==Good catch on hexagonal not octagonal Hall of Remembrance==

Hi. I wanted to congratulate [[User talk:Wikigi|Wikigi]] on a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_Holocaust_Memorial_Museum&amp;diff=389481621&amp;oldid=377021655 good catch here], and note that this revision really is correct, and that the article has been wrong since, gulp, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_Holocaust_Memorial_Museum&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=326592781 18 November 2009] when it was &quot;corrected&quot; by an non-prolific IP editor. Of course this inaccuracy does not actually set the Thames on fire or affect the basic rate of income tax but it's nice to get things right. I felt, on checking, that perhaps the rather good picture might actually have helped mislead a little here, and I've made a note on [[commons:File_talk:HallOfRemembrance.jpg|the image's Talk page]] which I hope might help clarify the issue for others in the future. Best wishes to all, [[User:DisillusionedBitterAndKnackered|DBaK]] ([[User talk:DisillusionedBitterAndKnackered|talk]]) 10:51, 8 October 2010 (UTC)

== A little lost here ==

the claim is that gas chambers killed millions of Jews. BUT, this article talks about the &quot;collections&quot; at the museum. So, in this museum, is there any exhibit that talks about the massive gas chamber program or not? [[User:Trueethnic|Trueethnic]] ([[User talk:Trueethnic|talk]]) 01:38, 10 June 2011 (UTC)

:Yes, there is a significant portion of an exhibit on the gas chambers including a scale model of the process. However, that has nothing to do with the article. Please refrain from pushing any revisionist views here as this article is solely about the museum and not about the Holocaust itself. [[User:Vindicata|Vindicata]] ([[User talk:Vindicata|talk]]) 20:29, 7 July 2011 (UTC)

== Quality ranking ==

I'm curious as to this article's ranking as start-class. After reviewing [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Assessment FAQ]] I feel that this article meets the criteria for a C-Class article. The main area in which it fails to meet B-class criteria is the sources. Virtually all of the sources cited are on the USHMM's own website, and thus are not valid because they are self-published. There must be other sources that can be added. Even with this major issue, I see no reason for the article to not be rated C-Class. Opinions? [[User:MyNameWasTaken|MyNameWasTaken]] ([[User talk:MyNameWasTaken|talk]]) 05:39, 17 August 2011 (UTC)
:Also, I've added &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Primary Sources}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to address that problem [[User:MyNameWasTaken|MyNameWasTaken]] ([[User talk:MyNameWasTaken|talk]]) 05:46, 17 August 2011 (UTC)

== Over-loaded See-Also section ==

The See Also section is way too big, and most of the articles have at most a tangential relationship to the article. I'm being bold trimming it down in accordance with this guideline: &quot;A reasonable number of relevant links that would be in the body of a hypothetical perfect article are suitable to add to the &quot;See also&quot; appendix of a less developed one. Links already integrated into the body of the text are generally not repeated in a &quot;See also&quot; section, and navigation boxes at the bottom of articles may substitute for many links (see the bottom of Pathology for example). However, whether a link belongs in the &quot;See also&quot; section is ultimately a matter of editorial judgment and common sense. Indeed, a good article might not require a &quot;See also&quot; section at all. Thus, although some links may not naturally fit into the body of text they may be excluded from the &quot;See also&quot; section due to article size constraints. Links that would be included in the article were it not kept relatively short for other reasons may thus be appropriate, though should be used in moderation, as always. Links included in the &quot;See also&quot; section may be useful for readers seeking to read as much about a topic as possible, including subjects only peripherally related to the one in question. The &quot;See also&quot; section should not link to pages that do not exist (red links) or disambiguation pages. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Portal}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikipedia-Books}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;  links are usually placed in this section&quot; Most of these links would not be in the 'perfect article'. --e Robert-Houdin 20:42, 23 August 2011 (UTC)

==Freed not in the Holocaust==
[[James Ingo Freed]] was not a &quot;Holocaust survivor;&quot; his family left Germany and came to the US when he was nine, in 1939. See his article.--[[User:Parkwells|Parkwells]] ([[User talk:Parkwells|talk]]) 22:38, 17 October 2012 (UTC)

== Description of boxcar picture not accurate. ==

&quot;Replica of a Holocaust train boxcar used by Nazi Germany to transport Jews and other victims during the Holocaust.&quot;

The museum's boxcar is a genuine holocaust train boxcar which the museum secured through great efforts of its directer Mr. Weinberg in Poland and was shipped over to Washington.

== Muslim visitors ==

Why is it relevant that X amount of visitors should be from &quot;Muslim-majority countries&quot;?
