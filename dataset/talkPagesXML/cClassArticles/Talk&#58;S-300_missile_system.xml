== Users - Azerbaijan &amp; Armenia ==

Last update has been deleted! The Azerbaijan bought the PMU2 version last year (2010) and it's been confirmed by many media companies that this is true. Azerbaijan will buy 2 batteries S-300PMU2 missiles, where as a standard S-12 battery comprises of 2 Giant missile launchers and 2 Gladiator launchers.

Recent announcements about Armenian armed forces bought the S-300 missiles are not confirmed and only a political move against Azerbaijan and Russian side did not confirm the Armenian purchase. As the Armenian defense ministry announced that some of the units where operated by Armenian servicemen, this does not mean that the missiles are in Armenian service. The Russians still owns the entire S-300 missile complexes where the Armenian personel only operates them under Russian command, not more not less. The Azerbaijani armed forces bought them and will be trained and put operational under Azeri command.[[User:Sonertje80|Sonertje80]] ([[User talk:Sonertje80|talk]]) 20:22, 12 April 2011 (UTC)

Armenian forces operate S-300 PM and PT versions around Yerevan, the russian S-300 V is in the russian military base in Gyumri and is operated by russian soldiers but commanded by russian and armenian staff.

== Users - Czechoslovakia and Slovakia ==

Czechoslovakia got S-300PMU with 5V55R missiles in 1990 (to equip one SAM battalion) and Slovakia inherited this system in 1993. There was wrong info that CS got it in 1985 - this is evidently mistaken with S-200 system and in the same line was another mistake that Slovakia got it in 1992 which is nonsense as Slovakia did not exist as independent state in that year (independence since 1993).

== Max engagement altitude? ==


So, what is the max engagement altitude for the S-300 SAM? For a SAM this information is very important. Somebody who knows about this SAM, please add this information here. It would be helpful if the max alitutude is mentioned for each S-300 version. I am assuming that when the designers improved the max range they also improved the max engagement altitude. Thanks..

:According to the Rosoboronexport catalog it's 27 km for the PMU-1 and PMU-2 and 30 km for the V and VM variants. They didn't specify for which missiles though. - [[User:Dammit|Dammit]] 22:19, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

----

Is the missile really the SA-10 or the SA-14 (or somehow both)?  If it's the SA-10, the reference to &quot;SA-14&quot; should be changed.  If it's the [[SA-14 Gremlin|SA-14]], the info on it should be moved there and SA-10 made a redirect to [[Systems Concepts]].  If the missile is both, [[SA-14 Gremlin|SA-14]] should be created, perhaps as a redirect.
--[[User:SHeumann|SHeumann]] 05:37, 19 Jun 2004 (UTC)

&quot;Max. Speed&quot; in the table was changed to &quot;Speed&quot;. I changed it to &quot;Top Speed&quot; because &quot;Speed&quot; is too ambiguous. It could refer to average speed, which is a different figure. These figures are approximate but they're approximate maximums; at such high speeds, friction will be incredible and missile speed will drop rapidly, so average speed will most likely be lower for all but the shorter engagements. [[User:Nvinen|Nvinen]] 01:41, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== 'Big' missile ==

I'd like to see some sources for the 'Big' missile as part of the S-300 system. As far as I could find the missile is at most ''compatible'' with the S-300 system, but was developed as a part of the [[S-400]] program. [http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/airdef/s-400.htm FAS.org - &quot;S-400 SA-20 Triumf&quot;] supports that, as do the the websites mentioned in this article under [[SA-10_Grumble#External_links|External links]] by stating the maximum range at 200km. - [[User:Dammit|Dammit]] 23:12, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

== Move to S-300 ==
I'd like to see this article moved to its proper, native name from its NATO codename. I've already started moving the other missile launchers in this series to their appropriate pages; some were already there. t seems to make more sense to call them by their names, rather than nicknames given to them by some other agency. This article, however, is written more to the tune of &quot;SA-10&quot;, though it still consistently refers to it as &quot;S-300&quot;. I'll move it soon, unless there's a compelling argument to the contrary. --[[User:Oceanhahn|Oceanhahn]] 02:53, 27 May 2006 (UTC)
:'''Agree''', in fact, in my opinion we need a naming convention for this since there are a few exceptions. [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (aircraft)]] could be a good starting point for a first draft. By the way, note that S-300 wouldn't be a very good name for the article, because of the ambiguaty with the S-300V (SA-12).

...are entirely different systems, confused a lot with eachother due to similar designation. They should definitely be separated to own pages, containing all the subversions of each system (aka: S-300P would discuss P,PMU (-2,-3) and similarly for S-300V family).

As for croatian systems, I believe they only managed to obtain missile launchers, but not the radar vehicles. Sources on this deal are poor...

:More recent info on Iran; major diplomatic work revealed by WL's leaked cables cover the subject of delays of the S-300 and the pressure US diplomats put on Russian officials to delay deliveries.

== Map of users ==

I have removed the map because it shows Iran as a user. Officially it has not received any, and the assertion that it has is not apparently based on confirmed reports. I would therefore suggest that it should be removed. We need a new map that shows official users, also showing countries that have ''ordered'' but not yet inducted such weapons in a different colour. 

The map does show other countries that do use the missile, but we shouldn't use images that show incorrect data. [[User:John Smith&amp;#39;s|John Smith&amp;#39;s]] ([[User talk:John Smith&amp;#39;s|talk]]) 23:14, 1 November 2010 (UTC)

== Produced by Samsung ==
The paragraph about the misile ever produced by Samsung is incorrect, and including it in the introduction paragraph sounds as if South Korea had a part in development.

The reference listed there points to the following information, listing that only a letter of intent was signed:

&quot;The Russian arms manufacturer, Almaz,
signs a letter of intent with South Korean
firm Samsung for the joint production of the
S-300 anti-missile system.  Russia will probably sell a complete S-300 anti-missile system to South Korea.&quot;
