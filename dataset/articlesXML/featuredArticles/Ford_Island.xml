'''Ford Island''' ({{lang-haw|Poka {{okina}}Ailana}}) is an [[islet]] in the center of [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Oahu]], in the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]].  It has been known as '''Rabbit Island''', '''Marín's Island''', and '''Little Goats Island''', and its native Hawaiian name is '''''Moku{{okina}}ume{{okina}}ume'''''. The island had an area of {{convert|334|acres}} when it was surveyed in 1825, which was increased during the 1930s to {{convert|441|acres}} with fill [[dredge]]d out of Pearl Harbor by the [[United States Navy]] to accommodate [[battleship]]s.

It was the site of an ancient Hawaiian fertility ritual, which was stopped by [[Christian]] missionaries during the 1830s. The island was given by [[Kamehameha I]] to Spanish deserter [[Francisco de Paula Marín]], and later returned to the [[monarchy]]. After the island was bought at auction by James Isaac Dowsett and sold to Caroline Jackson, it became the property of Dr. [[Seth Porter Ford]] by marriage and was renamed Ford Island. After Ford's death, his son sold the island to the [[John Papa ʻĪʻī]] estate and it was converted into a [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]].

In 1916, part of Ford Island was sold to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] for use by an aviation division in Hawaii, and by 1939 it was taken over by the U.S. Navy as a station for battleship and [[submarine]] maintenance. From the 1910s to the 1940s, the island continued to grow as a strategic center of operations for the U.S. Navy in the Pacific Ocean. Ford Island was at the center of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and on the U.S. Pacific Fleet by the Japanese fleet on December 7, 1941. It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964, and {{as of|2011|lc=y}} the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] has listed the island as one of the United States' most-endangered historic sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2001/Jul/07/ln/ln04a.html|title=Ford Island's aging historic sites face new assault|author=Will Hoover|newspaper=Honolulu Advertiser|date=July 7, 2001|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theinq2001&quot; /&gt;

By the late 1990s, hundreds of millions of dollars had been invested in real estate development and infrastructure, including a new bridge. Ford Island continues to serve an active role in the Pacific, hosting military functions at the Pacific Warfighting Center and civilian functions at [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]'s [[Pacific Tsunami Warning Center]]. The island has been featured in films such as ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' and ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' and receives tourists from the U.S. and abroad at the [[USS Arizona Memorial|USS ''Arizona'' memorial]] and the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)#Museum ship (1998 to present)|USS ''Missouri'' museum]].

==Geography==
Ford Island is located inside Pearl Harbor, South O{{okina}}ahu of the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Co_VIPIJerIC&amp;pg=PA390|location=Massachusetts|year=1997|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-546-9|page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl Harbor is divided into three large bodies of water called the West Loch, Middle Loch and East Loch with Ford Island in the center of the East Loch. It is {{convert|1.5|mile}} long and {{convert|0.75|mile}} wide, and was enlarged from {{convert|334|to|441|acre}} between 1930 and 1940 with land fill dredged from the surrounding harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot;&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/rods/fulltext/r2011090004192.pdf | format=PDF |title=Record of Decision Ford Island Land fill|publisher=Department of the Navy|date=September 2011|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot; /&gt; The land is a relatively flat plain rising from {{convert|5|to|15|ft}} above mean water level, and slopes toward Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt; It connects to the larger island of O{{okina}}ahu, surrounding Pearl Harbor, via a {{convert|4672|ft|m|abbr=yes|adj=on}} bridge at its northern tip which crosses east to Halawa Landing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ailcho&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cho|first=Aileen|title=A Buoyant Crossing|journal=Engineering News-Record|date=August 18, 1997|volume=239|issue=7|pages=34, 35, 37 &lt;!--|accessdate=February 16, 2014--&gt;|publisher=McGraw-Hill|issn=0013-807X |oclc=761166077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island's soil is composed primarily of [[volcano|volcanic]] material, [[lagoon]]al deposits and [[coral]]line debris, with silty sand from the dredging.&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt; Its volcanic material is [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian ash]], weathered [[tuff]] and [[basalt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt; Ford Island proper is a coral outcrop.&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt; There are two smaller islets near the island: Mokunui and Mokuiki.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 2008, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contamination===
In 1991, the Navy discovered nine metals, two semi-volatile [[organic compound]]s and a [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] in Ford Island's [[soil contamination|soil]], groundwater and marine sediment. Suspected sources were nine {{convert|225000|gal|adj=on}} fuel tanks on the east-central side of the island (from 1924 to 1954), a {{convert|4.4|acre|adj=on}} [[landfill]] on the southwestern shore (from 1930 to 1960) and ordnance bunkers on the northeastern side.&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt; An investigation suggested covering the contaminated areas with clean soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt; In 1994, the Navy considered removing the contaminated soil and installed six wells to monitor groundwater, but decided to follow the original recommendation in 1995 and capped the contaminated soil with topsoil and erosion-resistant vegetation (including [[Bermuda grass]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt; The containment system was completed in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The wildlife on Ford Island is likely very similar to that on [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hawaii Range Complex: Environmental Impact Statement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=At43AQAAMAAJ|publisher=US Department of the Navy|location=Washington D.C.|volume=2|year=2008|pages=467–468}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildlife is sparse and dominated by [[invasive species]] such as the [[house mouse]], [[mongoose]], [[brown rat]], [[black rat]], [[house sparrow]], [[Java sparrow]] and [[common myna]]h.&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt; An endangered owl, the endemic [[pueo]] (a subspecies of the [[short-eared owl]]), has been seen hunting on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt; Nearly all the plant life on the island is non-native,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Programmatic EIS, Ford Island Development, Pearl Harbor: Environmental Impact Statement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndw3AQAAMAAJ|year=2002|page=3|location=Washington D.C.|publisher=US Department of the Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Cactus#Uses|edible cacti]] from [[California]] introduced in the late 1700s by Francisco de Paula Marín.&lt;ref&gt;Gast &amp; Marín 1937, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The island's harbor was important to ancient Hawaiians for its ample supply of fish, including [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[milkfish]] and Hawaiian [[anchovy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;navfac2011&quot; /&gt; The [[National Park Service]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] oversee and administer the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument battlefields at Pearl Harbor and Ford Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doss2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Erika Doss|title=Memorial Mania: Public Feeling in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-RiQiBwzFCcC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-15939-3|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no historical records provide an exact date, researchers at the [[Hawaiian Historical Society]] believe that the island was given to Francisco de Paula Marín on February 9, 1818, and later named after him for his assistance in providing weapons used by Kamehameha I to conquer the island of [[O'ahu|O{{okina}}ahu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stesum1978p57&quot; /&gt; However, Marín wrote in an 1809 journal entry that he was given the island and its adjacent fishing waters as early as 1791.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/hawaii-airfields-airports/oahu-pre-world-war-ii/History%20of%20NAS%20128%20%28PH%29%201945.pdf | format=PDF |title=History of Naval Air Station, Navy Number 128|author=W.

In 1825, Admiral [[George Byron, 7th Baron Byron|George Byron, the 7th Baron Byron]] arrived, commanding the [[HMS Blonde (1819)|HMS ''Blonde'']], to return the remains of [[Kamehameha II]] and Queen [[Kamāmalu]] after their deaths in England of [[Measles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Macrae1922&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James Macrae|title=With Lord Byron at the Sandwich Islands in 1825: Being Extracts from Thems.

===Sugar reciprocity===

Sugar had been a major export from Hawaii since Captain [[James Cook|James Cook's]] arrival in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Deerr 1949, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1850s, the U.S. import tariff on sugar from Hawaii was much higher than the import tariffs Hawaiians were charging the U.S., and [[Kamehameha III]] sought reciprocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pratt1939p260&quot;&gt;Pratt 1939, pp. 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1873, a United States military commission recommended attempting to obtain Ford Island in exchange for the tax-free importation of sugar to the U.S.&lt;ref name=FIH&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Island History|url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/hawaii-airfields-airports/oahu-pre-world-war-ii/ford-island|publisher=State of Hawaii|accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[John Schofield]], U.S. commander of the military division of the Pacific, and [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Burton S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii to ascertain its defensive capabilities. U.S. control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of the west coast of the United States, and they were especially interested in [[Iroquois Point, Hawaii|Pu'uloa]], Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dye1997&quot;&gt;Dye 1997, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of one of Hawaii's harbors was proposed by [[Charles Reed Bishop]], a foreigner who had married into the [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehameha family]], had risen in the government to be [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Hawaii)|Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs]], and owned a country home near Pu'uloa. He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]], privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, [[Lunalilo|William Charles Lunalilo]], was content to let Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any cession of land. By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking, against his doctor's advice; his health declined swiftly, and he died on February 3, 1874.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dye1997&quot; /&gt;

Lunalilo left no heirs. The legislature was empowered by the constitution to elect the monarch in these instances&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphree2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel S.

On January 20, 1887, the United States began leasing Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;M.2010&quot; /&gt; Shortly afterwards, a group of mostly non-Hawaiians calling themselves the ''Hawaiian Patriotic League'' began the [[Hawaiian Rebellions (1887–95)|Rebellion of 1887]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Lee|title=The Hawaii State Constitution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UvdoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|location=New York|date=March 18, 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-987796-6|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They drafted their own constitution on July 6, 1887.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dyke2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon M.

The Oahu Sugar Company (also known as the Oahu Sugar Cane Plantation) leased about {{convert|300|acre}} from the John Papa ʻĪʻī estate (after their purchase of the island in 1891) to harvest sugar in 1899.&lt;ref name=&quot;dorrance1998p145&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=FIH /&gt; The business was successful, and the company sublet land from [[Benjamin Dillingham]] on the Waipi'o peninsula (southeast of present [[Waipio, Hawaii|Waipio]]) to build a 12-roller mill and railroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;dormor2000p49&quot;&gt;Dorrance &amp; Morgan 2000, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dormor2000p49&quot; /&gt; Sugarcane was grown and harvested on Ford Island with a network of [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] from freshwater reservoirs, transported to Waipio by barge and then by rail to the mills.&lt;ref name=&quot;dormor2000p49&quot; /&gt;

The initial bombs struck the island at 07:57 local time, prompting the historic dispatch: &quot;Air Raid, Pearl Harbor—this is no drill.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AttackOverView&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pw21941&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day 1960, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; The battleships ringing Ford Island were the Japanese attackers' primary targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;BattleshipRow&quot; /&gt; Twenty-four of the forty Japanese torpedo planes were assigned to attack Battleship Row, and five more came over to that side of Ford Island after failing to find battleships in other parts of the harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;BattleshipRow&quot; /&gt; The planes carried 29 [[Type 91 torpedo#Thunder fish|Type 91 aerial torpedoes]], each with a high-explosive payload of {{convert|450|lb}}, of which 12 are thought to have found their targets: two in ''California'', one in ''Nevada'' and a possible total of nine in ''Oklahoma'' and ''West Virginia''; the latter two ships sank within minutes of being hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;BattleshipRow&quot; /&gt;

Horizontal bomber aircraft delivering armor-piercing bombs attacked as the last torpedo planes finished, and other horizontal and [[dive bomber]]s came in later.&lt;ref name=&quot;BattleshipRow&quot; /&gt; The aircraft registered many direct hits and damaging near-misses, including two each on ''California'', ''Maryland'' and ''Tennessee'' and several more on ''West Virginia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BattleshipRow&quot; /&gt;

[[File:PLanes burning-Ford Island-Pearl Harbor.jpg|thumb|250px|Hangar 6 in flames after the attack on Ford Island|alt=A burning hangar with destroyed planes scattered in front]]
A bomb meant for the ''California'' hit Hangar 6 on the island, igniting it.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot; /&gt; Additional bombs hit Hangar 38 (a dud), the dispensary courtyard (leaving a large crater) and the road outside the repair-and-assembly hangar.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot; /&gt;  Only one man, Theodore Wheeler Croft, was killed on the island while standing guard duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot; /&gt;

The bombers' most notable success was ''Arizona''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BattleshipRow&quot; /&gt; A bomb exploded near the forward magazines, triggering a catastrophic explosion which immediately sank the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;BattleshipRow&quot; /&gt;  The island's freshwater supply was cut off when the ''Arizona'' severed the main water line and the auxiliary line was destroyed at the Pearl Harbor end.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot; /&gt;  The ''Nevada'', which eventually got underway while under attack, was hit repeatedly by dive bombers who spotted a ship escaping from Ford Island. So she would not sink between the island and the Navy Yard (blocking the entire harbor), ''Nevada'' was run aground.&lt;ref name=&quot;BattleshipRow&quot; /&gt;

Several planes from the aircraft carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, near Hawaii after a mission to [[Wake Island]], arrived in the midst of the attack; four were shot down by American air-defense friendly fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavalAirStation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.history.navy.mil/our-collections/photography/wars-and-events/world-war-ii/pearl-harbor-raid/attacks-on-airfields-and-aerial-combat/naval-air-station--ford-island--during-the-pearl-harbor-raid.html|title = Naval Air Station, Ford Island|accessdate = 2015-06-12|publisher = Naval History and Heritage Command}}&lt;/ref&gt; H.

Sixty concrete [[Revetment (aircraft)|revetments]] were constructed to protect aircraft from another attack,&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot; /&gt; and the Navy laid down a {{convert|16|inch|adj=on}} water main from across the harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot; /&gt; A new control tower was commissioned on May 1, 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot; /&gt; and the Navy built bomb shelters and gas-decontamination chambers.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot; /&gt; Due to the need for better control of the US Pacific Fleet, its headquarters moved to Ford Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy1945&quot; /&gt;

In planning the island's development, the Navy considered its operational needs and the island's historic value.&lt;ref name=&quot;preserv2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2001/Jun/25/ln/ln01a.html|title=Ford Island caught in tug-of-war between Navy, preservationists|date=June 25, 2001|newspaper=Honolulu Advertiser|author=William Cole|accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the National Trust for Historic Preservation considered the Navy's communication style more directive rather than collaborative, restricting the NTHP's ability to share their concerns, and in 2001 designated Ford Island one of its 11 most-endangered sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;preserv2001&quot; /&gt; Although the Navy's plans included preserving important hangars, the control tower and seaplane ramps, they failed to protect the existing runway and 1920s housing and did not address preserving bullet holes on the seaplane ramps.&lt;ref name=&quot;preserv2001&quot; /&gt;  As hoped by the Trust, after the designation the Navy agreed to delay development of some of these items until an agreement could be reached.&lt;ref name=&quot;preserv2001&quot; /&gt;

To accommodate additional facilities and housing, the Navy needed to upgrade the island's [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trentech2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trenchlessonline.com/index/webapp-stories-action/id.200|title=5,000-ft HDD bore of electrical conduit completed as part of infrastructure upgrade at famous site|author=Grady Bell|publisher=Trenchless Technology|date=June 1, 2006|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sewage system was upgraded with the 2001 installation of a {{convert|6000|ft|adj=on}}, {{convert|20|in|adj=on}} sewage main from the island to Pearl Harbor and improvements to the sewage-pumping station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fukunagaengineers.com/projects/award-winning-projects/fy01-mcon-project-p-491/|title=FY01 MCON Project P-491, Sewer Force Main – Ford Island to Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard|date=May 15, 2001|accessdate=May 25, 2014|publisher = Fukunaga &amp; Associates, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the bridge's unique design, which includes a floating section, it was impossible to use it to transit cable across the loch.&lt;ref name=&quot;trentech2006&quot; /&gt; In 2005, the Navy contracted drilling for primary and auxiliary conduits {{convert|20|ft}} apart and parallel to the bridge from Halawa Landing to the Ford Island golf course.
