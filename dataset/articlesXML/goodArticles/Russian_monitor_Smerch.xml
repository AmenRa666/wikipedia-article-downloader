'''''Smerch''''' ({{lang-ru|Смерч}}) was a [[monitor (warship)|monitor]] built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the early 1860s. She was designed by the British shipbuilder [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]] and built in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The ship spent her entire career with the [[Baltic Fleet]]. She [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] and sank shortly after she entered service in 1865. ''Smerch'' was [[marine salvage|refloated]] and repaired shortly afterwards. She became a [[training ship]] sometime after 1892 and was stricken from the [[Navy List]] in 1904. The ship was [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]ed five years later and renamed ''Blokshiv No. 2''. She was in Finland when that country declared its independence in 1918, but was returned to the Soviets after the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed. ''Blokshiv No. 1'', as the ship was now known, was sunk by German artillery fire in 1941. She was salvaged the following year and remained in service until she was stricken in 1959 and subsequently [[ship breaking|broken up]].

==Design and description==
The Russian [[Admiralty Board (Russian Empire)|Admiralty Board]] had previously licensed the design of the {{sclass-|Passaic|monitor|4}} from the United States and wished to compare the [[John Ericsson]]-designed [[gun turret]]s of those ships with the turrets designed by the British inventor [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Cowper Phipps Coles|Cowper Coles]]. The board therefore commissioned Mitchell to design a twin-turret monitor based on the {{ship|Danish ironclad|Rolf Krake}} and to build it in the [[shipyard]] that he had modernized for the board in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 149–50&lt;/ref&gt;

''Smerch'' was {{convert|188|ft|8|in|m|1}} long at the [[waterline]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|38|ft|2|in|m|1}} and a maximum [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|m|1}}. The ship was designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|1460|LT|t}}, but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced {{convert|1560|LT|t}}. ''Smerch'' was fitted with a [[double bottom]] that could be flooded in combat to reduce her [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]]. Her crew numbered 11 officers and 122 enlisted men in 1867 and 12 officers and 143 crewmen in 1875.&lt;ref name=m5&gt;McLaughlin, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a freeboard of only {{convert|2|-|2.5|ft|m|1}} and her deck was often awash in any sort of moderate sea. ''Smerch'' [[ship motions|rolled]] heavily and was fitted with three telescoping iron pole [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s, probably [[fore-and-aft rig]]ged, that were used to steady the ship rather than for propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 154–55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propulsion===
The ship had two simple horizontal [[Marine steam engine#Direct acting|direct-acting steam engines]], built by [[Maudslay, Sons and Field]] of London.&lt;ref name=r5&gt;Russian Monitors and Coast Defense Ships, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; The engines had a [[bore (engine)|bore]] of {{convert|36|in|m}} and a [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] of {{convert|18|in|m}} and each drove a single {{convert|7|ft|10|in|m|adj=on|sp=us}} propeller. Steam was provided by three rectangular [[fire-tube boiler]]s at a pressure of {{convert|1.7|atm|kPa psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The engines produced a total of {{convert|800|ihp|lk=in}} which gave ''Smerch'' a maximum speed of about {{convert|8.3|kn|lk=in}} when she ran her [[sea trial]]s from 12 to 17 June 1865. The ship also had a small [[donkey boiler]] for the small steam engine that powered the ventilation fans, the main water pump and rotated the aft turret. Another such engine probably rotated the forward turret. She carried {{convert|110|LT|t|0}} of coal which gave her a range of {{convert|600|-|800|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 150, 154&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament===
''Smerch'' was initially armed with four 60-pounder {{convert|7.72|in|adj=on|0}} [[smoothbore]] [[muzzle-loading gun]]s, a pair in each turret. Various deckhouses and ventilation hatches prevented the turrets from firing directly forward or aft, so each turret could bear approximately 145° to each side, although this changed slightly over time as changes were made to the ship. In 1867 these were replaced by two [[Krupp]] {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} [[Rifled breech loader|rifled breech-loading guns]]. Only one gun could fit in the turrets so the old [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] were plated over and new ones cut in each turret. Three years later, the Krupp guns were replaced by [[Obukhov State Plant|Obukhov]] {{convert|9|in|0|adj=on}} rifled guns. They were replaced in their turn in 1876 by two longer, more powerful 9-inch Obukhov guns. The ship carried 120 [[Cartridge (firearms)|rounds]] for each gun. A furnace for the molten iron required by Martin's [[Shell (projectile)|incendiary shells]] was fitted between the turrets.&lt;ref name=m3/&gt;

Light guns for use against [[torpedo boat]]s are not known to have been fitted aboard the ship before the 1870s when ''Smerch'' received four 4-pounder {{convert|3.4|in|adj=on}} guns, one {{convert|45|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} Engström [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) gun]], and a {{convert|.65|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Gatling gun]]. At some point the ship received four QF {{convert|37|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss]] revolving cannon. They were mounted on the turret tops and probably replaced the older 4-pounders.&lt;ref name=m3&gt;McLaughlin, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armor===
''Smerch'' had a complete [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[wrought iron]] that was {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick amidships and thinned to {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} at the ends of the ship. It was {{convert|7|ft|m|0}} high and completely covered the hull to {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|0}} below the waterline. The armor was backed by 8 inches of [[teak]].&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt; The circular turrets were protected by armor 4.5 inches thick and the area around the gun ports was reinforced by {{convert|1.5|in|adj=on}} plates to give a total thickness of {{convert|6|in|0}}. The walls of the ship's oval [[conning tower]] were also 4.5 inches thick.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; Her [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|1|in}} thick.&lt;ref name=w6&gt;Watts, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and service==
''Smerch'' (Waterspout)&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; was ordered on 25 June 1863 and construction began on 13 August at the [[Admiralty Shipyard]], Saint Petersburg, although the formal [[keel]]-laying was not until 1 December. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 June 1864 and completed in 1865 at the cost of 554,100 [[ruble]]s. The ship spent her career with the Baltic Fleet. ''Smerch'' struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast on 4 August in shallow water and sank. Using [[Float (nautical)|pontoons]], she was refloated on 1 September and repaired. Little is known of her service other than she was extensively refitted in 1882 and 1889 which included replacement of much of the plating of her hull bottom. The ship was reclassified as a [[coast defense ship|coast-defense]] ironclad on 13 February 1892 and subsequently became a training ship.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 152, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 20 February 1904 and turned over to the Port of [[Kronstadt]] for disposal. ''Smerch'' was renamed ''Blokshiv (Hulk) No. 2'' on 27 October 1909 and converted into a [[Naval mine|mine]] storage hulk. She was abandoned in April 1918 as the Soviets abandoned Finland, but was returned to them the following month according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The hulk was renamed ''Blokshiv No. 3'' in 1923 and later as ''Blokshiv No. 1'' on 1 January 1932. She was sunk by German artillery on 7 October 1941 in Kronstadt harbor and was stricken on 6 March 1942. The hulk was [[Marine salvage|salvaged]] in mid-1942 and reentered service on 8 December. She was renamed ''BSh-1'' on 16 May 1949, stricken for the last time on 2 April 1959, and subsequently [[ship breaking|scrapped]].&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;
