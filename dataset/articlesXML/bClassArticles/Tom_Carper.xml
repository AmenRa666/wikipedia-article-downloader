'''Thomas Richard''' &quot;'''Tom'''&quot; '''Carper''' (born January 23, 1947) is the senior [[United States Senator]] from [[Delaware]], serving since 2001. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Carper served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1983 to 1993 and was the [[List of Governors of Delaware|71st Governor of Delaware]] from 1993 to 2001.

A native of [[Danville, Virginia]], Carper graduated from [[Ohio State University]]. Serving as a [[Naval Flight Officer]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] from 1968 until 1973, he flew the [[P-3 Orion]] as a Tactical Coordinator/Mission Commander&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Navy Submarine to Bear Delaware's Name,&quot; Wilmington (Delaware) News Journal, 19 Nov 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and saw active duty in the [[Vietnam War]]. After leaving the active duty Navy, he remained in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] for another 18 years and eventually retired with the rank of [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] (O-6). Upon receiving his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1975, Carper went to work for the State of Delaware in its economic development office. He was elected State Treasurer, serving from 1977 to 1983 and leading the development of Delaware's first cash management system.

Encouraged by local politicians, Carper successfully ran for Delaware's only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. He served five terms in the House, where he chaired the Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization. In 1992 he arranged a swap with term-limited Governor [[Michael Castle]], and the two were easily elected to each other's seats. Carper governed for two terms as a moderate, business-oriented [[New Democrat]], following the lead of the two previous Republican governors. He successfully prevented the closing of a [[General Motors]] automobile plant and won a bid for the headquarters of pharmaceutical giant [[AstraZeneca]]. He led a tax-reduction campaign and helped improve the state's credit rating from among the worst in the nation to an excellent AAA. He pushed for standards-based education, among other reforms.

Carper was elected to the U.S. Senate [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2000|in 2000]], beating Republican incumbent [[William V. Roth, Jr.]]. He was re-elected by landslides in [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2006|2006]] and [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2012|2012]]. As senator, he serves as one of four Deputy Democratic Whips, serves as the ranking member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Senate Homeland Security Committee]] and also serves on the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Committee on Finance]]. Carper is currently the dean of the Delaware congressional delegation.

==Early years and personal life==
Carper was born in [[Beckley, West Virginia|Beckley]], West Virginia, the son of Mary Jean (née Patton) and Wallace Richard Carper. He grew up in [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]], Virginia and graduated from [[Whetstone High School (Columbus, Ohio)|Whetstone High School]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]]. He then graduated from the [[Ohio State University]] in 1968, where he was a midshipman in the [[Naval ROTC]] and earned a degree in economics. At Ohio State, Carper became a member of the Beta Phi Chapter of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] Fraternity.

Serving as a [[Naval Flight Officer]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] from 1968 until 1973, he served three tours of duty in [[Southeast Asia]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. He remained in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] as a [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 aircraft]] mission commander for another 18 years and retired with the rank of Captain (O-6).&lt;ref&gt;http://carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/biography-and-pictures&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he moved to Delaware and earned a [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1975. After which he went to work for the economic development office for the State of [[Delaware]]. Carper has been married twice, first in 1978, to Diane Beverly Isaacs, a former Miss Delaware, who had two children by a previous marriage. Following a 1983 divorce, he married Martha Ann Stacy in 1985, and with her he had two children, Christopher and Benjamin (who is an employee at [[Morgan Stanley]]). They are members of Westminster Presbyterian Church in Wilmington, Delaware.

==Professional and early political career==
While in college at the Ohio State University, Carper worked on the presidential campaign of U.S. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]], the Minnesota peace candidate. In Delaware he worked as the campaign treasurer for University of Delaware professor James R. Soles in his unsuccessful 1974 bid for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].

After receiving his MBA degree in 1975, Carper went to work for the State of Delaware's economic development office. In 1976, after developing good relationships with members of the state party leadership, he took out a $5,000 personal loan to fund his campaign for the Treasurer of Delaware. After convincing the party leaders, and later the voters, that he was the right person to be Delaware State Treasurer, he defeated the favored Republican Party candidate, Theodore Jones. He served three terms, from January 18, 1977 through January 3, 1983, during which time he oversaw the development of Delaware's first cash management system.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
[[File:Tom Carper 102nd Congressional portrait.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Carper during his time in the House of Representatives]]
It took a considerable amount of persuasion on the part of U.S. Senator [[Joe Biden]] and others to convince Carper to leave his obscure, but safe, position as Treasurer and compete for Delaware's only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. [[Thomas B. Evans, Jr.]], the incumbent Republican, was running again, and although he had been caught in a compromising &quot;association&quot; on a golfing trip with the young lobbyist Paula Parkinson, he was still a formidable and well-connected politician.

The campaign was going well for Carper until three weeks before Election Day, when the ''[[New York Post]]'' published an article claiming that the &quot;dirtiest campaign in the country is being waged in tiny Delaware.&quot; Retelling the well-known story of Evans' golfing trip, it went on to accuse Carper of abusing his wife and stepchildren. But the story actually ended up working to Carper's political advantage when suspicions spread that the allegations had been planted by an Evans supporter and when public opinion seemed to conclude that the allegations were inappropriately exploiting a private issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Only in Delaware, Politics and Politicians in the First State |last=Cohen |first=Celia |pages=293–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carper went on to serve five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. He won his second term in 1984, by defeating Elise R.W. du Pont, the wife of former Governor [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV]]. He then enjoyed easy victories over Republicans Thomas S. Neuberger in 1986, James P. Krapf in 1988 and Ralph O. Williams in 1990. A U.S. Representative, he was a member of the [[U.S. House Committee on Financial Services|U.S. House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs]] and the [[U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|U.S House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries]]. He chaired the House Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization. In these positions he worked to allow banks into the securities business and to discourage the dumping of sludge into the ocean.

During his years in the U.S. House of Representatives Carper sought to gain better control of the Democratic Party organization in Delaware in hopes of someday becoming Governor. Heavily Democratic and with over half of the population of the state, [[New Castle County]] was the key. Its Democratic organization was controlled by Eugene T. Reed, a former ironworker, and an old-time political party boss who was then among several politicians in both parties implicated in illegal money raising practices. To address this corruption and rescue the reputation of the Democratic Party, Carper recruited Joseph E. Reardon, a [[DuPont Company]] chemist, as a candidate for New Castle County Democratic Party chairman. By early 1989, he had succeeded in getting Reardon elected, and Reardon replaced Reed at the head of a newly reformed party organization. In 1990 Carper faced a primary challenge from a Reed ally, Daniel D. Rappa, but crushed him convincingly and went on to win election to his fifth term as U.S. Representative.

==Governor of Delaware==
In the small and intimate political community of Delaware important decisions are often made by a consensus of leaders from both parties. So it was in 1992, when popular incumbent (Republican) Governor [[Michael Castle]] was forced to retire owing to [[term limits]]. The result was what became known as &quot;the Swap.&quot; Castle ran for Carper's seat in the U.S. House of Representatives and Carper ran for Governor. Neither faced any significant opposition and Delaware retained the services of two very popular office holders representing both major parties.

Thus, in 1992, Carper was elected Governor of Delaware, defeating the Republican candidate, B. Gary Scott. He ended up serving two terms. As a moderate, business-oriented Democrat who followed two very competent and popular Republican administrations, those of Pierre S. du Pont, IV and Castle, Carper chose to govern in much the same way they had over their combined 16 years in office, adding to the mix his special interest in and talent for economic development and business recruitment. Two particular successes were his prevention of the closure of the [[General Motors]] automobile operation near [[Newport, Delaware]] and the state's victory in the competition with Pennsylvania for the location of the headquarters of the pharmaceutical giant, [[AstraZeneca]].

Continuing du Pont's tax cutting policies, Carper led an ongoing effort to reduce [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] rates, eliminate the [[marriage penalty]] and [[estate tax]], cut the public [[utility tax]], and eliminate the [[gross receipts tax]] for many small businesses. By doing so, his administration improved the state's credit rating from among the worst in the nation to an excellent &quot;AAA&quot;. He also retained Castle's standards-based education programs, raising standards, testing students, and pushing through a teacher accountability bill. Other programs included a fully funded [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] program and the creation of a prescription-drug benefit for seniors.

Carper's independent, [[New Democrat]] approach made him popular among voters, but caused grumbling among old line Democrats, particularly union leaders, who complained that not enough of them were being awarded patronage jobs after the many years of Republican control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Only in Delaware, Politics and Politicians in the First State |last=Cohen |first=Celia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an era of increasingly bitter, partisan politics, Carper's actions and policies placed him at the political center, in keeping with Delaware's consensus style of governing.

The most poignant event during this period was the murder of Carper's personal scheduler, Anne Marie Fahey, and the eventual conviction of [[Thomas J. Capano]] for the crime. Capano was a wealthy, well-connected lawyer, known to nearly everyone in Delaware's political community. Fahey, an attractive 30-year-old member of another well-known family, was attempting to end a romantic relationship with the married Capano, when he murdered her and dumped her body in the Atlantic Ocean. U.S. Attorney [[Colm F. Connolly]] built the case against Capano, who was tried and convicted, then sentenced by Delaware Superior Court Judge [[William Swain Lee]].

As a tribute to Fahey, who had been a youth [[mentorship|mentor]], then-Governor Carper also became a mentor, and began actively promoting mentoring programs throughout Delaware's business community. As a result, by the end of his last term, Delaware held the highest per-capita ratio of youth mentors in the country. Carper also established the Delaware Mentoring Council to help sustain this important legacy.

==United States Senate==

===Elections===

====2000====
{{See also|United States Senate election in Delaware, 2000}}
[[File:Thomas Carper.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Carper in his early Senate career]]
The elections of 2000 promised to bring a change in Delaware's political lineup. For 16 years, the same four people had held the four major statewide positions—Carper and fellow Democratic Senator [[Joe Biden]] and Republican U.S. Representative [[Michael Castle]] and Senator [[William V. Roth, Jr.]]. Because of gubernatorial term limits, Carper had to retire from the post. He wanted to run for the Senate against the incumbent Roth. Roth would not retire voluntarily and fellow Republican Castle would not force him into a primary. Carper declared his candidacy in September 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-09-21/politics/senate.2000_delaware.senate_1_delaware-governor-sixth-senate-term-delaware-residents?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a contest between two popular and respected politicians, the issue seemed to be Roth's age; Roth was seventy-nine, versus Carper's relative youth. Although Roth started the campaign with a 2-to-1 spending advantage, Carper went into the final month with more than $1 million on hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkie|first=Curtis|title=In Tight Race, Health Issues Dog Delaware's Roth|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/62928651.html?dids=62928651:62928651&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+26%2C+2000&amp;author=Curtis+Wilkie%2C+Globe+Correspondent&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;desc=IN+TIGHT+RACE%2C+HEALTH+ISSUES+DOG+DELAWARE%27S+ROTH&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=9 February 2013|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=26 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carper defeated Roth by almost twelve points, 55.5% to 43.7%. Roth received more votes than Presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]], however, suggesting that the strength of the Democratic turnout was a boon to Carper's candidacy and a key factor in his victory. Analysts considered Roth's defeat was due to age, especially as he collapsed at a campaign event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB7368E419B47F9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | date=November 8, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2006====
{{See also|United States Senate election in Delaware, 2006}}
Carper sought re-election to a second term in 2006. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary and faced off against Republican candidate [[Jan C. Ting]]. Ting was a professor of law who had narrowly beaten airline pilot Michael D. Protack in the Republican primary. Carper was easily re-elected in a landslide win, beating Ting 67% to 27%.

====2012====
{{See also|United States Senate election in Delaware, 2012}}
As the 2012 election cycle began, a [[Political action committee|Super PAC]] was created to oppose Carper's re-election campaign. ''The Hill'' quoted [[Patrick Davis (politics)|Patrick Davis]], the custodian of records and agent for Renew Delaware as saying &quot;Tom Carper has served in the United States Senate for a long time and has been part of the downturn in our economy.&quot; ''Delaware Politics'' noted that the election would be costly for the Republican candidate and that the popular Carper was heavily favoured to win a third term in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kevin Wade vs. Tom Carper?|url=http://www.delawarepolitics.net/kevin-wade-vs-tom-carper/|publisher=DelawarePolitics.net|accessdate=21 April 2012|author=Chris Slavens|date=Jul 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spokesperson Emily Spain was quoted in ''The Hill'' saying Carper has been successful in his previous campaigns &quot;because he works hard, takes nothing for granted, and puts the needs and interests of Delaware first.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super PAC opposing Sen. Tom Carper registers with FEC|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/187643-super-pac-opposing-sen-tomcarper-registers-with-fec|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=21 April 2012|author=Rachel Leven|date=10/14/11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carper won the Democratic primary with 88% of the vote and faced off against the only Republican candidate who filed for the race, businessman [[Kevin L. Wade|Kevin Wade]]. Carper was re-elected in another landslide, beating Wade 66.4% to 29%.

===Tenure and political positions===
He served with the Democratic minority in the 108th and 109th Congresses, and was part of the Democratic majority in the 110th Congress. At the beginning of the 107th Congress, the Democratic Party was in the minority, but later held the majority. Carper is a member of the moderate [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), of which he currently serves as Vice-Chairman. In December 2004, Carper became a part of the Senate Democratic Leadership. As a member of a four-person &quot;Executive Committee&quot;, he is one of four deputy whips. [[David Broder]] of the ''Washington Post'' has called Carper &quot;a notably effective and non-partisan leader, admired and trusted on both sides of the aisle.&quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Carper voted for the Budget Control Act, against cut, cap and balance, for debt increase, for debt ceiling increase, for debt limit increase, for the stimulus, for TARP, for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, for SCHIP, for DREAM, and for Immigration Reform Act of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political positions for Thomas Carper|url=http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Profiles/Senate/Delaware/Thomas_Carper/Views/ |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined in the unsuccessful attempt to tie the [[Bush administration tax cuts]] to [[Government budget deficit|deficit reduction]] and has supported additional funding for [[school choice]] programs and [[charter schools]]. He has also sought additional funding for railroad projects and for rail security. He strongly supported legislation to limit [[class action lawsuits]] and to restrict [[personal bankruptcy]]. In addition, he is a strong proponent of [[free trade]]. Carper proposed the creation of a [[National Park]] in Delaware, the Coastal Heritage Park, in four locations along the [[Delaware River]] and [[Delaware Bay]]. In January 2009 Carper briefly chaired a Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works hearing on the [[Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill|Tennessee Valley Authority's coal ash spill]] in Kingston, Tennessee.

In 2012, Carper sponsored a bill, eventually passed and signed into law, that required government agencies to identify $125 billion in expected waste and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Almanac of American Politics|date=2012|page=344|url=http://www.amazon.com/Almanac-American-Politics-2012/dp/0226038084|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coburn and Pilon criticized him for waiting until the end of the Congressional session to hold a hearing on the statehood of Washington D.C.

Unlike most senators, who maintain residences in both Washington, D.C., and in their home state, Carper commutes more than 100 miles by train from his home in Wilmington to the United States Capitol. Carper says this arrangement has helped his family live a normal life despite his demanding, high-profile job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ann Manser |title=UD Messenger Volume 10, Number 3 |url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/Messenger/01/3/thomas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 May 2015, he narrowly escaped injury when the train he took home [[2015 Philadelphia train derailment|derailed and crashed]] in Philadelphia shortly after he deboarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/amtrak-train-derails-killing-6-people-investigation-begins/ar-BBjHvLi|title=Amtrak train derails killing 6 people; investigation begins|work=msn.com|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act
Carper co-wrote the &quot;Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&amp;FileStore_id=4ee63497-ca5b-4a4b-9bba-04b7f4cb0123|pdf&lt;/ref&gt; introduced on June 19, 2010, by Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] (Senator [[Susan Collins]] is the third co-author of this bill). If signed into law, this controversial bill, which the American media dubbed the &quot;''[[Internet kill switch#Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010|Kill switch bill]]''&quot;, would grant the [[President of the United States|President]] emergency powers over the Internet. All three co-authors of the bill, however, issued a statement claiming that instead, the bill &quot;[narrowed] existing broad Presidential authority to take over telecommunications networks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nokillswitch&quot;&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/security/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=225701368&amp;subSection=News Senators Say Cybersecurity Bill Has No 'Kill Switch'], informationweek.com, June 24, 2010. Retrieved on June 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Carper was quoted as saying that the bill “would create a National Center for Cybersecurity and Communications in the Department of Homeland Security, with a Senate-confirmed director to oversee security of the federal government’s computer networks. The center would also identify vulnerabilities and help secure key private networks – like utilities and communications systems – that, if attacked or commandeered by a foreign power or cyberterrorists, could result in the crippling of our economy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We must 'arm' cyberspace battlefront|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0610/38336_Page2.html|accessdate=2 April 2012|author=SEN. JOE LIEBERMAN &amp; SEN. SUSAN COLLINS &amp; SEN. TOM CARPER|date=6/10/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Credit-card amendment 
In May 2010, Carper introduced an amendment to limit state regulators from enforcing consumer regulations on national banks and their subsidiaries. It would also remove a Senate legislative measure requiring the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] to find a 'substantive standard' on regulation, before the office could move to preempt. The White House opposed Carper's amendment. The amendment passed by a vote of 80–18; some critics{{Who|date=July 2012}} described the vote as a victory for the credit card industry and other financial institutions. Financial institutions stated the law allow will save the consumer from the costs of more regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House fights back against Carper amendment to Wall Street reform bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/banking-financial-institutions/97729-white-housefights-back-against-dem-amendment-to-wall-st-bill|publisher=TheHill.com|accessdate=2 April 2012|author=Silla Brush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Gas tax 
Carper and [[George Voinovich]] of Ohio proposed a 25-cent raise in the federal gasoline tax; 10 cents would go to pay down the debt and the rest toward improving the nation's infrastructure. The measure was proposed in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Our Radar: A Proposed Gas Tax Increase|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/on-our-radar-a-proposed-gas-tax-hike/|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2012|author=JOHN COLLINS RUDOLF|date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure did not pass.

;Postal bailout bill 
On May 14, 2011, the ''Wall Street Journal'' criticized a postal-bailout bill co-sponsored by Carper and Susan Collins of Maine. The bill would give $50–$75 billion to USPS, and would underwrite pension obligations for retired postal workers. The bailout would cost three times the savings of the 2011 federal budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress looking at new bill to bail out postal workers|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704613504576268983131039272.html|publisher=Examiner.com|accessdate=11 April 2012|author=Kenneth Schortgen Jr|date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Jobs bill
On September 21, 2011, ''The Wall Street Journal'' noted that President Obama's job-creation plans were drawing resistance from Senate Democrats. The article quoted Carper as saying, “I think the best jobs bill that can be passed is a comprehensive long-term deficit-reduction plan. That's better than everything else the president is talking about combined.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Do-Nothing Democrats?|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904194604576583090732336436.html|publisher=WSJ.com|accessdate=11 April 2012|date=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Minimum wage
In April 2014, the United States Senate debated the [[Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress)]]. The bill would amend the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period.&lt;ref name=1737sum&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 1737 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1737|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was strongly supported by President [[Barack Obama]] and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House.&lt;ref name=ObamaClearChoice&gt;{{cite news|last=Sink|first=Justin|title=Obama: Congress has 'clear choice' on minimum wage|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/202475-obama-congress-has-clear-choice-on-minimum-wage|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reidpunts&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=Reid punts on minimum-wage hike|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/202964-reid-punts-on-minimum-wage-hike|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CentristRepubs&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=Centrist Republicans cool to minimum wage hike compromise|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/202641-centrist-republicans-cool-to-wage-compromise|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carper said that he preferred legislation that would have a greater chance of becoming law, such as an increase to only $9 an hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reidpunts&quot;/&gt;
