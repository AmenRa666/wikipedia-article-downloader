{{nihongo|'''''Hayashio'''''|早潮|lit. &quot;Swift Tide&quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;Nelson. ''Japanese-English Character Dictionary''. Page 476, 570;&lt;/ref&gt; was the fifth vessel to be commissioned in the 19-vessel {{sclass|Kagerō|destroyer|0}} [[destroyer]]s built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in the late-1930s under the [[3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme (Japan, 1937)|Circle Three Supplementary Naval Expansion Program]] (''Maru San Keikaku'').

==Background==
The ''Kagerō''-class destroyers were outwardly almost identical to the preceding [[light cruiser]]-sized {{sclass-|Asashio|destroyer|4}}, with improvements made by Japanese naval architects to improve stability and to take advantage of Japan's lead in [[torpedo]] technology. They were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and in both day and night attacks against the [[United States Navy]] as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie &amp; Evans, ''Kaigun'' .&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, only one survived the [[Pacific War]].&lt;ref&gt;Globalsecurity.org, IJN Kagero class destroyers&lt;/ref&gt;

'' Hayashio'', built at the [[Uraga Dock Company]], was laid down on 30 June 1938, launched on 19 April 1939 and commissioned on 31 August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0427.htm | title= Asashio class 1st class destroyers| last= Nishidah | first=  Hiroshi| year= 2002 | work= Materials of the Imperial Japanese Navy | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Hayashio'', was assigned to Destroyer Division 15 (Desdiv 15), and a member of Destroyer Squadron 2 (Desron 2) of the [[IJN 2nd Fleet]], and had deployed from [[Palau]], as part of the escort for the [[aircraft carrier]] {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ryūjō||2}} in the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|invasion of the southern Philippines]] and [[minelayer]] {{ship|Japanese minelayer|Yaeyama||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/hayaso_t.htm  | title= IJN ''Hayashio'': Tabular Record of Movement |author= Allyn D. Nevitt  |date= |year= 1998 |month= |work= |publisher= combinedfleet.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1942, ''Hayashio'' participated in the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|invasion of the Netherlands East Indies]], escorting the invasion forces for [[Menado]], [[Kendari]] and [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] in January, and the invasion forces for [[Makassar]], [[Timor]] and [[Java]] in February. At the end of March, she returned with {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2}} from [[Staring-baai]] in [[Sulawesi]] to [[Sasebo Naval District|Sasebo]].

At the end of April, ''Hayashio'' deployed from Kure to assist in the occupation of the Cagayan Islands near [[Palawan]] in early May, and then returned with the damaged carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shōkaku||2}} from [[Manila]] to Kure on 17 May. In early June, ''Hayashio'' deployed from [[Saipan]] as part of the troopship escort for the [[Battle of Midway]].

In mid-June, ''Hayashio'' was assigned as escort for cruisers in projected further [[Indian Ocean raid]]s, but the operation was cancelled by the time she reached [[Mergui]] in Burma, and she was reassigned as escort for the cruisers {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kumano||2}} and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Suzuya||2}} to [[Balikpapan]] and the [[Solomon Islands]]. During the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] of 24 August she was part of [[Nobutake Kondō|Admiral Kondō]]'s Advance Force, but was not in combat. During September, ''Hayashio'' was used for patrols between [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and [[Guadalcanal]], and in October began operations as a &quot;[[Tokyo Express]]&quot; high speed troop transport to Guadalcanal. These operations continued to early-February 1943. During the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] on 26 October, she was assigned to the escort if the aircraft carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'yō||2}}, returning after the battle with cruisers {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Maya||2}} and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Suzuya||2}} to [[Shortland Island]]. During the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on 13–15 November, ''Hayashio'' served as [[flagship]] of the troop convoy escorts. After the battle, she returned with ''Maya'', ''Suzuya'' and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tenryū||2}} to [[Kavieng]].

On 24 November 1942, while on a transport run to [[Lae]], ''Hayashio'' was attacked by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] bombers and caught fire. Attempts to quench the fires stopped after the magazine exploded, and Captain Kiyoshi Kaneda gave the order to abandon ship. After removing the survivors, she was scuttled by a torpedo launched by the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Shiratsuyu||2}}, in Guna Bay, [[Huon Gulf]] ({{coord|07|0|S|147|30|E|display=inline,title }}). She was removed from the [[navy list]] on 20 June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = David| year = 1990 | title = Warship Losses of World War Two| publisher = Naval Institute Press| isbn = 1-55750-914-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hayashio'' was removed from the [[navy list]] on 24 December 1942.
