The '''de Havilland DH 112 Venom''' was a British postwar single-engined jet aircraft developed from the [[de Havilland Vampire]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunston 1981, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; It served with the [[Royal Air Force]] as a single-seat [[Strike fighter|fighter-bomber]] and two-seat [[night fighter]].
The Venom was an interim between the first generation of British jet fighters – straight-wing aircraft powered by [[centrifugal compressor|centrifugal flow]] engines such as the [[Gloster Meteor]] and the Vampire and later swept wing, [[axial compressor|axial flow]]-engined designs such as the [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. The Venom was successfully exported, and saw service with Iraq, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and Venezuela.

The [[de Havilland Sea Venom|Sea Venom]] was a navalised version for carrier operation.

==Design and development==
[[File:Venom FB1 Silh.jpg|thumb|right|de Havilland Venom FB 1]]
The Venom's lineage lay in the aircraft it was intended to replace, the Vampire, which had been the second jet aircraft to enter service with the RAF.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Gloster Meteor was the first jet aircraft to enter service with the RAF, and saw service during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, de Havilland proposed a development of the Vampire with a thin wing and more powerful engine as a high altitude fighter, the '''Vampire FB 8'''. In most respects, the Venom was quite similar to the Vampire, sharing the distinctive [[twin-boom]] tail and composite wood/metal structure, although the Venom differed in parts.  The idea was adopted and a Vampire F 1 was converted by fitting the new [[de Havilland Ghost]] engine, which was more powerful than the [[de Havilland Goblin]] used on the Vampire. As the '''DH 112''', the Venom filled an [[Air Ministry]] requirement for a fast, manoeuvrable and capable fighter-bomber to replace its progenitor.

The first Venom prototype flew on 2 September 1949,&lt;ref name=&quot;Birt 1 p242&quot;&gt;Birtles ''Air Pictorial'' July 1971, p.242.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first Venom variant, a single-seat fighter-bomber, entered service in 1952 as the '''FB 1'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birt 1 p243&quot;&gt;Birtles ''Air Pictorial'' July 1971, p.243.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 375 of these would be built. It was armed with four 20&amp;nbsp;mm (.79&amp;nbsp;in) [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano Mk V]] [[autocannon]]s in the nose and could carry either two 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb (approx 450&amp;nbsp;kg) bombs&lt;ref group=note&gt;1,000 lb was the nominal weight of these Medium Capacity bombs&lt;/ref&gt; or eight [[RP-3]] 60&amp;nbsp;lb (27&amp;nbsp;kg) air-to-ground rocket projectiles – the heavier bombs being an improvement over the Vampire FB 5. It was powered by a single 4,850&amp;nbsp;lbf (21.6&amp;nbsp;kN) thrust Ghost 48 Mk.1 engine.
[[File:DH.112 Venom NF.3 WX791 FAR 11.09.54 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Venom NF.3 showing the clear view canopy and revised tail surfaces of this mark.]]
The next Venom, the '''NF.2''' night fighter, first flew on 22 August 1950 and entered service in 1953, having been delayed after some minor problems with the type.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birt 2 p281-2&quot;&gt;Birtles ''Air Pictorial'' August 1971, pp. 281–282.&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate the necessary two man crew (pilot and navigator/radar operator) it was structurally different – the two crew were positioned side-by-side and an airborne interception radar was fitted in the nose. It replaced the Vampire NF 10, and was followed by '''NF 3''', which was the last night fighter variant of the Venom, first flying in 1953 and entering service in 1955. The night fighter Venoms had a relatively brief career with the Royal Air Force, having been only an interim solution, and was withdrawn in 1957 and replaced by the [[Gloster Javelin]] twin-engined all-weather fighter. 
[[File:DH.112 Venom FB4 WR540 Ringway 25.03.56 edited-2.jpg|thumb|left|Venom FB.4 with revised tail surfaces. This aircraft served Nos. 28 and 60 Squadrons of the RAF.]]
The final Venom for the RAF was the single-seat '''FB.4''' which first flew on 29 December 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birt 1 p244&quot;&gt;Birtles ''Air Pictorial'' July 1971, p.244.&lt;/ref&gt; It entered service in 1955 and 250 were built. It was powered by a single 4,850&amp;nbsp;lbf (21.6&amp;nbsp;kN) thrust de Havilland Ghost 103 turbojet engine. It also received an ejector seat and some modifications to its structure along with powered ailerons.&lt;ref name=&quot;BritishFighter p363&quot;&gt;The British Fighter since 1912 p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aircraft-RAF p235&quot;&gt;Aircraft of the Royal Air Force since 1918 pp. 235–236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Venomfb4PN&quot;&gt;Pilot's Notes Venom FB Mk 4: 2nd edition A.P.4335D pp. 9, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Main production of the Venom was by de Havilland, augmented by numbers of FB.1, FB.4 and NF.51 built by [[Fairey Aviation]] at [[Manchester Airport|Manchester (Ringway) Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholefield, 1998, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
[[File:DH.112 Venom FB.1 WK418 Fairey RWY 03.54.jpg|thumb|right|Venom FB.1 built by Fairey Aviation in 1954]]
[[File:DH.112 Venom NF2 WL808 FAR 06.09.52 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|RAF Venom NF.2 night fighter at the [[Farnborough air show]] in 1952]]

The RAF fighter-bomber Venoms saw service during the [[Malayan Emergency]] which took place between 1948 and 1960, although they did not begin operations until the mid-1950s with Nos. [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45]] and [[No. 60 Squadron RAF|60]] Squadrons RAF. While there, the Venom supported operations against [[Communist]] guerrillas as part of [[Operation Firedog]], the codename for Royal Air Force operations in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]. Venoms were lent to the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] for use in the same conflict where they operated with [[No. 14 Squadron RNZAF]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birt 1 p246-7&quot;&gt;Birtles ''Air Pictorial'' July 1971, pp. 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venom also saw service during the [[Suez Crisis]] being operated by Nos. [[No. 6 Squadron RAF|6]], [[No. 8 Squadron RAF|8]] and [[No. 249 Squadron RAF|249]] Squadrons RAF flying from [[RAF Akrotiri]], [[Cyprus]]. The Anglo-French invasion, codenamed [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]], took place in response to the nationalisation of the [[Suez Canal]] by [[Egypt]]'s leader, General [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]. The air war began on 31 October 1956 signalling the beginning of the Suez War. The Venoms launched a number of sorties, attacking a variety of military installations on the ground. They also saw much action in the [[Middle East]], supporting operations against terrorists in [[Aden]] and [[Oman]], losing some aircraft in the process. Venoms additionally saw service during the [[Mau Mau]] insurgency in [[Kenya]].

All Venoms in RAF service were withdrawn from first-line service in 1962, having proven their worth in a variety of locations across the world, in peace and war, and in some of the most difficult climates the RAF has ever faced. The last non-RAF Venoms to leave active service were [[Swiss Air Force]] Venoms which retired in 1983. About 20 Venoms continue to fly as of 2004, performing at various air shows, while a number of examples are preserved in museums in the [[United Kingdom]] and abroad, in non-flying, static display condition.

==Surviving aircraft==
[[File:Swiss Air Force De Havilland DH-112 Mk 4 Venom being serviced.jpg|thumb|A [[Swiss Air Force]] Venom with its array of armaments at the [[Flieger-Flab-Museum]].]]

The Venom has been preserved in significant numbers, thanks in part to its longevity with the Swiss Air Force. In the UK, a number of Sea Venoms are preserved, along with examples of the NF 3 and Swiss-built FB.50 and 54. In Sweden, two examples of the NF.51 are preserved. There are many survivors in Switzerland, and other Swiss aircraft are scattered throughout Europe. One such aircraft is preserved in the [[Israeli Air Force]] Museum in [[Hatzerim Airbase|Hatzerim]], although in the colours of the Iraqi Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airliners.net/photo/Iraq---Air/De-Havilland-Venom/1547676/L/ &quot;De Havilland Venom FB50 (DH-112) aircraft.&quot;] ''airliners.net''. Retrieved: 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, a number of Sea Venom FAW.53s have also survived. Venezuela has the only complete surviving British-built single-seat Venom.

Although the Venom was, for a time, a popular and cheap warbird the number of airworthy aircraft is dwindling. Currently there are two in the UK that fly regularly, along with a single example in Switzerland, that flew from 1988 until 2011, when it went to New Zealand. Another one flew in the USA. All are licence-built Swiss examples.
