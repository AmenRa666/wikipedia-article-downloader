'''Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr.''' (born '''Leslie Lynch King Jr.'''; July 14, 1913 – December 26, 2006) was an American [[politician]] who served as the 38th [[President of the United States]] from 1974 to 1977.  Prior to this he was the 40th [[Vice President of the United States]], serving from 1973 until President [[Richard Nixon]]'s resignation in 1974. He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]], following the [[Spiro Agnew#Resignation|resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew]] on October 10, 1973.  Becoming president upon Richard Nixon's departure on August 9, 1974, he claimed the distinction as the first and to date only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to either office.  Before ascending to the vice presidency, Ford served 25 years as [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]], the final nine of them as the House [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]].

As President, Ford signed the [[Helsinki Accords]], marking a move toward [[détente]] in the [[Cold War]]. With the [[Fall of Saigon|conquest of South Vietnam]] by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency, U.S. involvement in [[Vietnam]] essentially [[Vietnam War#Exit of the Americans: 1973–1975|ended]]. Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the [[Great Depression]], with growing inflation and a [[recession]] during his tenure.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|pages= xxiii, 301}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his more controversial acts was to grant a [[presidential pardon]] to President Richard Nixon for his role in the [[Watergate scandal]]. During Ford's presidency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President.&lt;!-- (Please keep hidden until fully developed below) &quot;This was made clear by developments in two major substantive issues during Ford's presidency: the Cyprus crisis and Arab Israeli relations.&quot; --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenczowski&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[George Lenczowski]]|title=American Presidents, and the Middle East|year=1990|isbn=0-8223-0972-6|pages=142–143|publisher=Duke University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republican presidential primary campaign of 1976, Ford defeated then-former California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] for the Republican nomination. He narrowly lost the [[United States presidential election, 1976|presidential election]] to the  [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger, then-former Georgia Governor [[Jimmy Carter]], on November 2.

Following his years as President, Ford remained active in the Republican Party.  After experiencing health problems, he [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|died in his home]] on December 26, 2006. Ford [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|lived longer than any other U.S. president]], 93 years and 165 days, while his [[List of Presidents of the United States by time in office|895-day presidency]] remains the shortest term of all presidents who did not die in office. He is also the most recent former president and vice president to die.

==Early life==
Gerald Rudolph Ford was born '''Leslie Lynch King Jr.''' on July 14, 1913, at [[3202 Woolworth Avenue]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. His mother was [[Dorothy Ayer Gardner Ford|Dorothy Ayer Gardner]] and his father was [[Leslie Lynch King Sr.]], a wool trader and a son of prominent banker [[Charles Henry King]] and Martha Alicia King (née Porter). Dorothy separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to the [[Oak Park, Illinois]], home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. From there, she moved to the home of her parents, Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer, in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. Dorothy and King divorced in December 1913; she gained full custody of her son. Ford's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Young, Jeff C.|title=The Fathers of American Presidents|year=1997|isbn=0-7864-0182-6|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gerald Ford 1916.gif|left|thumb|upright|alt=A young boy circa 1916.|Leslie Lynch King Jr. (later known as Gerald R. Ford) in 1916]]

Ford later said his biological father had a history of hitting his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;ford-Nebraska&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Nebraska-born Ford Left State as Infant|author=Funk, Josh|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|date=December 27, 2006|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec27/0,4670,FordNebraska,00.html|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; James M. Cannon, a member of the Ford administration, wrote in a biography of Ford that the Kings' separation and divorce were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a [[butcher knife]] and threatened to kill his wife, his infant son, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs-knife&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Cannon |first=James |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/ford.html |title=Gerald R. Ford |work=Character Above All|publisher=Public Broadcasting System |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two and a half years with her parents, on February 1, 1916, Dorothy married [[Gerald Rudolff Ford]], a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company. They then called her son ''Gerald Rudolff Ford, Jr.'' The future president was never formally [[adoption|adopted]], and did not legally change his name until December 3, 1935; he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name.&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/grf/genealog.asp|title=Gerald R. Ford Genealogical Information |work=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library &amp; Museum |publisher=University of Texas |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[East Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] with his three half-brothers from his mother's second marriage: [[Thomas Gardner Ford|Thomas Gardner &quot;Tom&quot; Ford]] (1918–1995), Richard Addison &quot;Dick&quot; Ford (1924–2015), and James Francis &quot;Jim&quot; Ford (1927–2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Ford remembered as active steward of President Gerald Ford's legacy|work=MLive|date=March 20, 2015|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2015/03/richard_ford_dies.html|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford also had three half-siblings from the second marriage of Leslie King, Sr., his biological father: Marjorie King (1921–1993), Leslie Henry King (1923–1976), and Patricia Jane King (born 1925). They never saw one another as children and he did not know them at all. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his biological father, whom Ford described as a &quot;carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son&quot;, approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant. The two &quot;maintained a sporadic contact&quot; until Leslie King, Sr.'s death in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;ford-Nebraska&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Common Man on an Uncommon Climb|work=The New York Times|date=August 19, 1976|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&amp;res=F10F10FF3E5D14768FDDA00994D0405B868BF1D3|page=28|accessdate=April 26, 2009 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford said, &quot;My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful. So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhardt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kunhardt Jr. |first=Phillip |url=http://www.americanpresident.org/history/geraldford/biography/resources/ArticlesCopy1/KunhardtFordBio.article.shtml |title=Gerald R.

Ford was involved in the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and earned that program's highest rank, [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].&lt;ref name=&quot;honor&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Townley |first=Alvin |url=http://us.macmillan.com/legacyofhonor|title=Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts |publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York |pages=12–13 and 87|isbn=0-312-36653-1 |accessdate=December 29, 2006 |year=2007 |origyear= December 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the only Eagle Scout to have ascended to the U.S. Presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;honor&quot;/&gt;

Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School, where he was a star athlete and [[captain (sports)|captain]] of the [[American football|football]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Investigatory Records on Gerald Ford, Applicant for a Commission|date=December 30, 1941|publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0069/2825430.pdf|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the [[Grand Rapids City League]]. He also attracted the attention of college recruiters.&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhardt&quot;/&gt;

== College and law school ==
Attending the [[University of Michigan]] as an undergraduate, Ford became a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity (Omicron chapter) and washed dishes at his fraternity house to earn money for college expenses.

Ford played [[center (American football)|center]], [[linebacker]] and [[long snapper]] for the school's football team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wertheimer|first=Linda|title=Special Report: Former President Gerald Ford Dies; Sought to Heal Nation Disillusioned by Watergate Scandal|date=December 27, 2006|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4529638|accessdate=April 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]] in two undefeated seasons and [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national titles]] in [[1932 Michigan Wolverines football team|1932]] and [[1933 Michigan Wolverines football team|1933]]. The team suffered a steep decline in his [[1934 Michigan Wolverines football team|1934]] senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless. After a game during which Michigan held heavily favored [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] later said, &quot;When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them. Ford and [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense.&quot; Ford later recalled, &quot;During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds.&quot; His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, &quot;They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perry&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |first=Will |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/FootballStudies/1999/FS0202h.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Wolverines: A Story of Michigan Football|chapter=No Cheers From the Alumni |pages=150–152 |publisher=The Strode Publishers |location=Huntsville, Alabama|isbn=0-87397-055-1|accessdate=December 28, 2006 |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Ford's senior year a controversy developed when the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] refused to play a scheduled game if a black player named [[Willis Ward]] took the field. Even after protests from students, players and alumni, university officials opted to keep Ward out of the game. Ford was Ward's best friend on the team and they roomed together while on road trips. Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team in response to the university's decision, but eventually agreed to play against Georgia Tech when Ward personally asked him to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Brian | last = Kruger | first2 = Buddy | last2 = Moorehouse | title = Willis Ward, Gerald Ford and Michigan Football's darkest day | date = August 9, 2012 | url = http://blogs.detroitnews.com/history/2012/08/09/willis-ward-gerald-ford-and-michigan-footballs-darkest-day/ | work = The Detroit News | accessdate = October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Ford was selected for the Eastern Team on the Shriner's East West Crippled Children game at San Francisco (a benefit for crippled children), played on January 1, 1935. As part of the 1935 Collegiate All-Star football team, Ford played against the [[Chicago Bears]] in the [[Chicago College All-Star Game]] at [[Soldier Field]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greene&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Greene |first=J.R. |title=The Presidency of Gerald R. Ford (American Presidency Series)|page=2 |year=1995|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=978-0-7006-0638-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honor of his athletic accomplishments and his later political career, the University of Michigan retired Ford's No. 48 jersey in 1994. With the blessing of the Ford family, it was placed back into circulation in 2012 as part of the [[Michigan Wolverines football#Michigan Football Legends|Michigan Football Legends]] program and issued to sophomore linebacker Desmond Morgan before a home game against [[University of Illinois|Illinois]] on October 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Named Michigan Football Legend; Morgan to Wear No. 48 Jersey|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101312aaa.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford remained interested in football and his school throughout life, occasionally attending games. Ford also visited with players and coaches during practices, at one point asking to join the players in the huddle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clumsy image aside, Ford was Accomplished Athlete|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 28, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2009|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/bal-sp.ford28dec28,0,6535524.story}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford often had the Naval band play the University of Michigan fight song, ''[[The Victors]]'', before state events instead of ''[[Hail to the Chief]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Press and the Ford Presidency | author=Rozell, Mark J. | date=October 15, 1992 | publisher=University of Michigan Press | isbn=0-472-10350-4 | page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his graduation in 1935 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Economics]], Ford turned down contract offers from the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]]. Instead, in September 1935 he took job as the boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach at [[Yale University]],&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas-grf-timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp|title=Timeline of President Ford's Life and Career|publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library &amp; Museum|accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied to its law school.&lt;ref name=&quot;proball&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Vice Presidents of the United States 1789–1993|author=Wendy Wolff|year=1997|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford hoped to attend Yale's law school beginning in 1935. Yale officials at first denied his admission to the law school because of his full-time coaching responsibilities. He spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the [[University of Michigan Law School]]&lt;ref name=&quot;umlaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/ford/timeline.html |title=The U-M Remembers Gerald R. Ford |publisher=The University of Michigan |accessdate=January 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually admitted in the spring of 1938 to [[Yale Law School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;librarybio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp |title=Gerald R. Ford Biography |publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library &amp; Museum| accessdate=January 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford earned his [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] degree in 1941 (later amended to [[Juris Doctor]]), graduating in the top 25 percent of his class.

While attending Yale Law School, Ford joined a group of students led by [[R. Douglas Stuart Jr.]], and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]]. The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the [[America First Committee]], a group determined to keep the U.S. out of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;onlinereader&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Doenecke|first=Justus D.|year=1990 |url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0817988416/ |title=In Danger Undaunted: The Anti-Interventionist Movement of 1940–1941 As Revealed in the Papers of the America First Committee (Hoover Archival Documentaries) |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |accessdate=December 28, 2006}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1940 he worked in [[Wendell Willkie]]'s presidential campaign.

Ford graduated from law school in 1941 and was admitted to the Michigan [[bar (law)|bar]] shortly thereafter. In May 1941, he opened a Grand Rapids law practice with a friend, [[Philip W. Buchen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas-grf-timeline&quot; /&gt; who would later serve as Ford's White House counsel.

Ford responded to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor]] by enlisting in the Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/washington/27webford.html?pagewanted=4|title=Gerald Ford, 38th President, Dies at 93 years and 165 day|last=Naughton|first=James M.|date=December 26, 2006|work=The New York Times|publisher=Naval Historical Center|author2=Adam Clymer|accessdate=October 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a commission as [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] on April 13, 1942. On April 20, he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid, and military drill. In addition, he coached in all nine sports that were offered, but mostly in swimming, boxing and football. During the year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]], on June 2, 1942, and to Lieutenant, in March 1943.

=== Sea duty ===
[[File:Gerald Ford playing basketball on USS Monterey 06-1944-Darkened Larger.jpg|right|thumb|Navy pilots in forward elevator well playing basketball. Jumper at left is Gerald R. Ford, mid-1944]]
After applying for sea duty, Ford was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier {{USS|Monterey|CVL-26}}, at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, [[Camden, New Jersey]]. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, until the end of December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the ''Monterey''. While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] with the [[United States Third Fleet|Third]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleets]] in late 1943 and 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure [[Makin (islands)|Makin Island]] in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against [[Kavieng]], New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the ''Monterey'' supported landings at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] and participated in carrier strikes in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Western Carolines]], and northern [[New Guinea]], as well as in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hove&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hove |first=Duane |title=American Warriors: Five Presidents in the Pacific Theater of World War II |publisher=Burd Street Press |isbn=1-57249-307-0|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the ''Monterey'' launched strikes against [[Wake Island]], participated in strikes in the Philippines and [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyus]], and supported the landings at [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Mindoro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hove&quot;/&gt;

Although the ship was not damaged by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces, the ''Monterey'' was one of several ships damaged by the [[typhoon]] that hit [[Admiral]] [[William Halsey Jr.|William Halsey's]] Third Fleet on [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|December 18–19, 1944]]. The Third Fleet lost three [[destroyer]]s and over 800 men during the typhoon. The ''Monterey'' was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18, the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide toward the edge of the deck. The two-inch steel ridge around the edge of the carrier slowed him enough so he could roll, and he twisted into the catwalk below the deck. As he later stated, &quot;I was lucky; I could have easily gone overboard.&quot;

Ford, serving as General Quarters Officer of the Deck, was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire. He did so safely, and reported his findings back to the ship's commanding officer, [[Stuart H. Ingersoll|Captain Stuart Ingersoll]]. The ship's crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lieutenant Gerald Ford and Typhoon Cobra|url=http://www.navyhistory.org/2013/02/lieutenant-gerald-ford-and-typhoon-cobra/|publisher=[[Naval Historical Foundation]]|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fire, the ''Monterey'' was declared unfit for service, and the crippled carrier reached [[Ulithi]] on December 21 before continuing across the Pacific to [[Bremerton, Washington]] where it underwent repairs. On December 24, 1944, at Ulithi, Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Navy Pre-Flight School at [[Saint Mary's College of California]], where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. One of his duties was to coach football. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command, [[Naval Air Station Glenview|Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois]], as the Staff Physical and Military Training Officer. On October 3, 1945, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander]].

Ford received the following military awards: the [[American Campaign Medal]], the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with nine [[Service star|{{frac|3|16}}&quot; bronze stars]] (for operations in the [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], Marshall Islands, Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids, [[Battle of Hollandia|Hollandia]], Marianas, Western Carolines, Western New Guinea, and the Leyte Operation), the [[Philippine Liberation Medal]] with two {{frac|3|16}}&quot; bronze stars (for Leyte and Mindoro), and the [[World War II Victory Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;navy&quot;/&gt;

===Post-war===
In January 1946, Ford was sent to the Separation Center, [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] to be processed out. He was released from active duty under honorable conditions on February 23, 1946. On June 28, 1946, the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] accepted Ford's resignation from the Naval Reserve.

Ford was a member of several civic organizations, including the [[United States Junior Chamber|Junior Chamber of Commerce]] (Jaycees), [[American Legion]], [[AMVETS]], [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]], [[Sons of the Revolution]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Gerald R.

Ford was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] on September 30, 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scottish&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070112051723/http://www.scottishrite.org/ee.php The Supreme Council], Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; He later said in 1975, &quot;When I took my obligation as a master mason—incidentally, with my three younger brothers—I recalled the value my own father attached to that order. But I had no idea that I would ever be added to the company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCSB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=5485 |title=Gerald Ford |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California – Santa Barbara |accessdate=January 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and children==
[[File:Gerald R. Ford, Jr., and Betty Ford following their marriage.jpg|thumb|alt=A man in a suit leads a flower-carrying woman by the hand, walking out of a chapel.|The Fords on their wedding day, October 15, 1948]]
On October 15, 1948, at Grace [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in Grand Rapids, Ford married [[Betty Ford|Elizabeth Bloomer Warren]] (1918–2011), a department store fashion consultant. Warren had been a [[John Robert Powers]] fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the [[Martha Graham]] Dance Company. She had previously been married to and divorced from William G. Warren.

At the time of his engagement, Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of thirteen terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives. The wedding was delayed until shortly before the elections because, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford, &quot;Jerry was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jane|last=Howard |authorlink=Jane Howard (journalist) |title=The 38th First Lady: Not a Robot At All |work=The New York Times|date=December 8, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had four children:
*[[Michael Gerald Ford|Michael Gerald]], born in 1949
*[[John Gardner Ford|John Gardner]], known as Jack, born in 1951
*[[Steven Ford|Steven Meigs]], born in 1956
*[[Susan Ford|Susan Elizabeth]], born in 1958

Ford Jr.&quot;, followed by &quot;Republican Primary September 14&quot;, with &quot;United States Representative&quot; across the bottom of the sign.|A billboard for Ford's 1948 Congressional Campaign]]
After returning to Grand Rapids in 1946, Ford became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to take on [[Bartel J. Jonkman]], the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed his view of the world. &quot;I came back a converted [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]&quot;, Ford wrote, &quot;and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]]. And I thought he ought to be replaced. Nobody thought I could win. I ended up winning two to one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhardt&quot;/&gt;

During his first campaign in [[United States House elections, 1948|1948]], Ford visited voters at their doorsteps and as they left the factories where they worked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winget&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Winget, Mary Mueller|title=Gerald R.

Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years, holding the Grand Rapids [[congressional district]] seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty. As an editorial in ''The New York Times'' described him, Ford &quot;saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and the record shows it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-editorial&quot;&gt;{{cite news|date=December 28, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/opinion/28thur1.html |title=Gerald R.

Ford described his philosophy as &quot;a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/geraldford/|title=Gerald R. Ford|publisher=The White House|accessdate=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was known to his colleagues in the House as a &quot;Congressman's Congressman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.+Res.+409: Celebrating the life of President Gerald R. Ford on what would have been his 96th birthday,]'' H.R. 409, [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]], 1st Session (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, Ford declined offers to run for either the Senate or the Michigan governorship. Rather, his ambition was to become [[United States Speaker of the House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/grf/fordbiop.asp |title=Gerald R.

===Warren Commission===
[[File:Lbj-wc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Warren Commission]] presents its report to President Johnson]]

{{Further information|Warren Commission|Assassination of John F. Kennedy }}
On November 29, 1963, Democratic President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] appointed Ford to the [[Warren Commission]], a special task force set up to investigate the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller Center of Public Affairs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/presidentialclassroom/exhibits/lbj-appoints-gerald-ford-to-the-warren-commission |title=LBJ Appoints Gerald Ford to the Warren Commission |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs |access-date=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the accused assassin. According to a 1963 [[FBI]] memo released in 2008, Ford was in contact with the FBI throughout his time on the Warren Commission and relayed information to the deputy director, [[Cartha DeLoach]], about the panel's activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarrenJustice&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Justice for All: Earl Warren and the Nation He Made|last=Newton|first=Jim|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2007|isbn= 978-1-59448-270-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WPostFBI&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/07/AR2008080702757.html|title=Ford Told FBI of Skeptics on Warren Commission|last=Stephens|first=Joe|date=August 8, 2008|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI File&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-08-09-ford-fbi-file_N.htm|title=Ford told FBI about panel's doubts on JFK murder|work=USA Today|date=August 9, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to his book, ''A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission'', Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Ford | first=Gerald R. | title=A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission | year=2007|publisher=The FlatSigned Press|isbn=978-1-934304-02-0 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=HOCdGQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House Minority Leader===

In 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a landslide victory for his party, securing another term as president and taking 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace [[Charles Halleck]] of [[Indiana]] as Minority Leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters of the House: Congressional leadership over two centuries|publisher=Westview Press|year=1988|pages=267–275|author1=Roger H. Davidson |author2=Susan Webb Hammond |author3=Raymond Smock }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1965, the Republicans had 140 seats in the House compared with the 295 seats held by the Democrats. With that large majority, and a majority in the U.S. Senate, the Johnson Administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by Johnson the &quot;[[Great Society]].&quot; During the first session of the [[89th United States Congress|Eighty-ninth Congress]] alone, the Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress, and Johnson signed 84, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in Congressional history.&lt;ref name=&quot;unger104&quot;&gt;Unger, Irwin, 1996: 'The Best of Intentions: the triumphs and failures of the Great Society under Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon': Doubleday, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, criticism over the Johnson Administration's handling of the [[Vietnam War]] began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1966|1966 midterm elections]] saw a 47-seat swing in favor of the Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;/&gt;

Ford's private criticism of the Vietnam War became public following a speech from the floor of the House, in which he questioned whether the White House had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;/&gt; The speech angered President Johnson, who accused Ford of having played &quot;too much football without a helmet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Timesteady&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Gerald Ford: Steady Hand for a Nation in Crisis|work=Time |author=Gray, Paul|date=December 27, 2006|accessdate=September 16, 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1572927,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Minority Leader in the House, Ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with [[Illinois]] Senator [[Everett Dirksen]], in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson's policies. Many in the press jokingly called this &quot;The Ev and Jerry Show.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ussenate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Gerald |date=May 23, 2001 |url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Leaders_Lecture_Series_Ford.htm |title=Address by President Gerald R.

After [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] was elected in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an advocate for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and the [[Tax Reform Act of 1969]]. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a [[Revenue Sharing]] program for state and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Social Policy|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=1-4129-5076-7|page=162|author1=James Midgley |author2=Michelle Livermore }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nixon Reconsidered|author=Hoff, Joan|publisher=Basic Books|year=1995|page=69|isbn=0-465-05105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eight years (1965–1973) that Ford served as Minority Leader, he won many friends in the House because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;/&gt;

==Vice presidency (1973–74)==

On October 10, 1973, Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned and then pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted $29,500 in bribes while governor of Maryland. According to ''The New York Times'', Nixon &quot;sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement. The advice was unanimous. 'We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,' [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Carl Albert]] recalled later&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-editorial&quot;/&gt;

Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] had been implemented. The [[United States Senate]] voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, voted against Ford's confirmation: [[Gaylord Nelson]] of [[Wisconsin]], [[Thomas Eagleton]] of [[Missouri]] and [[William Hathaway]] of [[Maine]]. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One hour after the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.

Ford became Vice President as the [[Watergate scandal]] was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Alexander Haig]] contacted Ford to tell him that &quot;[[smoking gun]]&quot; evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated [[Number One Observatory Circle|vice president's residence]] in Washington, D.C. However, &quot;Al Haig [asked] to come over and see me,&quot; Ford later said, &quot;to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.{{'&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhardt&quot;/&gt;

On September 8, 1974, Ford issued [[:wikisource:Proclamation 4311|Proclamation 4311]], which gave Nixon a full and unconditional [[pardon]] for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while President.&lt;ref name=&quot;pardonspeech&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Gerald |date=September 8, 1974 |url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/740061.htm|title=President Gerald R.

The Nixon pardon was highly controversial. Critics derided the move and said a &quot;[[corrupt bargain]]&quot; had been struck between the men.&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhardt&quot;/&gt; They said that Ford's pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon's resignation, which had elevated Ford to the presidency. Ford's first press secretary and close friend [[Jerald terHorst]] resigned his post in protest after the pardon. According to [[Bob Woodward]], Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig proposed a pardon deal to Ford. He later decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship he and Nixon shared.&lt;ref name=&quot;shanescott&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott |last=Shane |title=For Ford, Pardon Decision Was Always Clear-Cut|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/washington/29pardon.html|work=The New York Times|page=A1 |accessdate=September 8, 2009 | date=December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the [[United States presidential election, 1976|election in 1976]], an observation with which Ford agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;shanescott&quot;/&gt; In an editorial at the time, ''The New York Times'' stated that the Nixon pardon was a &quot;profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act&quot; that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's &quot;credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-editorial&quot;/&gt; On October 17, 1974, Ford testified before Congress on the pardon.

In the months following the pardon, Ford often declined to mention President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] by name, referring to him in public as &quot;my predecessor&quot; or &quot;the former president.&quot; When, on a 1974 trip to California, White House correspondent [[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]] pressed Ford on the matter, Ford replied in surprisingly frank manner: &quot;I just can’t bring myself to do it.”&lt;ref&gt;http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/fred-barnes/&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ford left the White House in January 1977, the former President privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of ''[[Burdick v. United States]]'', a 1915 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt.&lt;ref&gt;''Shadow'', by [[Bob Woodward]], chapter on Gerald Ford; Woodward interviewed Ford on this matter, about twenty years after Ford left the presidency&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[John F.

On September 16, shortly after he announced the Nixon pardon, Ford introduced a conditional [[amnesty]] program for Vietnam War [[draft dodger]]s who had fled to countries such as [[Canada]], and for military deserters, in Presidential Proclamation 4313.

The 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place less than three months after Ford assumed office and in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1974|House elections]], taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the [[94th United States Congress|94th Congress]] overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since [[Andrew Johnson]] was President of the United States (1865–1869).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2007/05/bush-vetoes-less-than-most-presidents.html Bush vetoes less than most presidents], CNN, May 1, 2007.

On February 5, 1976, an [[United States Army|army]] recruit at [[Fort Dix]] mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|health officials]] announced that &quot;swine flu&quot; was the cause. Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be [[vaccination|vaccinated]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.htm?programID=06-P13-00009&amp;segmentID=1 Pandemic Pointers].

The vaccine was blamed for twenty-five deaths; more people died from the shots than from the swine flu.&lt;ref&gt;Mickle, Paul. [http://www.capitalcentury.com/1976.html 1976: Fear of a great plague].

Ford was an outspoken supporter of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], issuing Presidential Proclamation no. 4383 in 1975:

Ford attended the inaugural meeting of the [[Group of Eight|Group of Seven]] (G7) industrialized nations (initially the G5) in 1975 and secured membership for Canada. Ford supported international solutions to issues. &quot;We live in an interdependent world and, therefore, must work together to resolve common economic problems,&quot; he said in a 1974 speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;canadaG7&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/12/27/ford-canada.html |title=President Ford got Canada into G7 |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Company|accessdate=December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to internal White House and Commission documents posted in February 2016 by the National Security Archive at The George Washington University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/ National Security Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; the Gerald Ford White House significantly altered the final report of the supposedly independent 1975 Rockefeller Commission investigating CIA domestic activities, over the objections of senior Commission staff. The changes included removal of an entire 86-page section on CIA assassination plots and numerous edits to the report by then-deputy White House Chief of Staff [[Richard Cheney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB543-Ford-White-House-Altered-Rockefeller-Commission-Report ''Gerald Ford White House Altered Rockefeller Commission Report in 1975; Removed Section on CIA Assassination Plots,'' National Security Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle East====

In the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two ongoing international disputes developed into crises. The [[Cyprus dispute#Peacemaking efforts, 1964–1974|Cyprus dispute]] turned into a crisis with the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], causing extreme strain within the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Greek government]] withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenczowski&quot;/&gt; As Ford expected, Turkish relations were [[United States-Turkey relations#Invasion of Cyprus|considerably disrupted until 1978]].
[[File:Gerald Ford with Anwar Sadat in Salzburg 1975.jpg|thumb|Ford with [[Anwar Sadat]] in Salzburg, 1975]]
In the continuing [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], although the initial [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|cease fire]] had been implemented to end active conflict in the [[Yom Kippur War]], Kissinger's continuing [[shuttle diplomacy]] was showing little progress. Ford considered it &quot;stalling&quot; and wrote, &quot;Their [Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.240&lt;/ref&gt; During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], which included:
{{Quote|I wish to express my profound disappointment over Israel's attitude in the course of the negotiations ... Failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations. I have given instructions for a reassessment of United States policy in the region, including our relations with Israel, with the aim of ensuring that overall American interests ... are protected. You will be notified of our decision.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, Yitzak (1996), ''The Rabin Memoirs'', University of California Press, p. 256, ISBN 978-0-520-20766-0&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On March 24, Ford informed congressional leaders of both parties of the reassessment of the administration policies in the Middle East. &quot;Reassessment&quot;, in practical terms, meant canceling or suspending further aid to Israel. For six months between March and September 1975, the United States refused to conclude any new arms agreements with Israel. Rabin notes it was &quot;an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American-Israeli relations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzak Rabin, The Rabin Memoirs, ISBN 0-520-20766-1 , p261&lt;/ref&gt; The announced reassessments upset the American Jewish community and Israel's well-wishers in Congress. On May 21, Ford &quot;experienced a real shock&quot; when seventy-six U.S. senators wrote him a letter urging him to be &quot;responsive&quot; to Israel's request for $2.59&amp;nbsp;billion in military and economic aid. Ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized. It was, since the September 1974 ban on arms to Turkey, the second major congressional intrusion upon the President's foreign policy prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Lenczowski]], American Presidents, and the Middle East, 1990, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; The following summer months were described by Ford as an American-Israeli &quot;war of nerves&quot; or &quot;test of wills&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.298&lt;/ref&gt; After much bargaining, the [[Sinai Interim Agreement]] (Sinai II), was formally signed on September 1, and aid resumed.

====Vietnam====
[[File:Kissinger, Ford and Mao, 1975 A7912.jpg|thumb|Ford and his daughter Susan watch as Henry Kissinger shakes hands with [[Mao Zedong]], December 2, 1975]]
One of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continued Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the [[Paris Peace Accords]], signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American [[POW|prisoners of war]]. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Church, Peter|title=A Short History of South-East Asia|location=Singapore|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2006|pages=193–194|isbn=978-0-470-82181-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accords had been negotiated by [[United States National Security Advisor]] Kissinger and North Vietnamese [[politburo]] member [[Lê Đức Thọ]]. South Vietnamese President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]] was not involved in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces. In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend Thieu's government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brinkley1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Brinkley, Douglas |year=2007 |title=Gerald R. Ford|isbn=0-8050-6909-7 |publisher=Times Books |location=New York, NY|pages=89–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1974, months after Ford took office, North Vietnamese forces invaded the province of [[Phuoc Long Province|Phuoc Long]]. General [[Trần Văn Trà]] sought to gauge any South Vietnamese or American response to the invasion, as well as to solve logistical issues, before proceeding with the invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurnow&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Karnow, Stanley|title=Vietnam: A History|publisher=Viking|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As North Vietnamese forces advanced, Ford requested Congress approve a $722&amp;nbsp;million aid package for South Vietnam, funds that had been promised by the Nixon administration.  Congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Challenges1970&quot;/&gt; Senator [[Jacob K. Javits]] offered &quot;...large sums for evacuation, but not one nickel for military aid&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Challenges1970&quot;/&gt; President Thieu resigned on April 21, 1975, publicly blaming the lack of support from the United States for the fall of his country.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/21/newsid_2935000/2935347.stm|title=Vietnam's President Thieu resigns|date=April 21, 1975|accessdate=September 24, 2009|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on April 23, Ford gave a speech at [[Tulane University]]. In that speech, he announced that the Vietnam War was over &quot;...as far as America is concerned&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brinkley1&quot;/&gt; The announcement was met with thunderous applause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brinkley1&quot;/&gt;

1,373 U.S. citizens and 5,595 [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and third country nationals were evacuated from the South Vietnamese capital of [[Saigon]] during [[Operation Frequent Wind]]. In that operation, military and [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] helicopters took evacuees to [[U.S. Navy]] ships off-shore during an approximately 24-hour period on April 29 to 30, 1975, immediately preceding the [[fall of Saigon]]. During the operation, so many South Vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people. Other helicopters, having nowhere to land, were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Vietnam War: An Almanac| last=Bowman| first=John S.| publisher=Pharos Books| year=1985| isbn=0-911818-85-5|page=434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the [[Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act]].

====Mayaguez and Panmunjom====
North Vietnam's victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions, once when [[Khmer Rouge]] forces seized an American ship in [[international waters]] and again when American military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Gawthorpe, A. J. (2009), &quot;The Ford Administration and Security Policy in the Asia-Pacific after the Fall of Saigon&quot;, ''The Historical Journal'', '''52'''(3):697–716.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first crisis was the [[Mayaguez incident]]. In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of [[Cambodia]], Cambodians seized the American merchant ship ''Mayaguez'' in international waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=May 19, 1975|url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/exhibits/vietnam/750519a.htm|title=Debrief of the Mayaguez Captain and Crew|publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford dispatched [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the ''Mayaguez'' sailors were being released. In the operation, two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down, and 41 U.S. servicemen were killed and 50 wounded while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;marinemerchants&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2000 |url=http://www.usmm.org/mayaguez.html |title=Capture and Release of SS Mayaguez by Khmer Rouge forces in May 1975 |publisher=United States Merchant Marine |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the American losses, the operation was seen as a success in the United States and Ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald R. Ford, ''A Time to Heal'', p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] wall in Washington, D.C.

Some historians have argued that the Ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot.&lt;ref&gt;Cécile Menétray-Monchau (August 2005), &quot;The Mayaguez Incident as an Epilogue to the Vietnam War and its Reflection on the Post-Vietnam Political Equilibrium in Southeast Asia&quot;, ''Cold War History'', p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gawthorpe|first=Andrew J.|date=September 1, 2009|title=The Ford Administration and Security Policy in the Asia-Pacific after the Fall of Saigon|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0018246X09990082|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=52|issue=03|pages=707–709|doi=10.1017/S0018246X09990082|issn=1469-5103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second crisis, known as the [[axe murder incident]], occurred at [[Panmunjom]], a village which stands in the DMZ between the two Koreas. At the time, this was the only part of the DMZ where forces from the North and the South came into contact with each other. Encouraged by U.S. difficulties in Vietnam, North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try and convince the U.S. to withdraw from South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorfer, Don (2001), ''The two Koreas: a contemporary history'' (New York, NY: Basic Books), pp. 47–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in August 1976, North Korean forces killed two U.S. officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom's [[Joint Security Area]]. The attack coincided with a meeting of the Conference of [[Non-Aligned Nations]] in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka, at which [[Kim Jong-il]], the son of North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]], presented the incident as an example of American aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U.S. withdrawal from the South.&lt;ref&gt;Gawthorpe, &quot;The Ford Administration and Security Policy&quot;, p. 711.&lt;/ref&gt;

At administration meetings, Kissinger voiced the concern that the North would see the U.S. as &quot;the paper tigers of Saigon&quot; if they did not respond, and Ford agreed with that assessment. After mulling various options the Ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major [[show of force]]. A large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree, while at the same time the air force was deployed, which included [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] flights over Panmunjom. The North Korean government backed down and allowed the tree-cutting to go ahead, and later issued an unprecedented official apology.&lt;ref&gt;Gawthorpe, &quot;The Ford Administration and Security Policy&quot;, pp. 710–714.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesian invasion of East Timor====
[[East Timor]]'s decolonization due to political instability in Portugal saw Indonesia posture to annex the new state in 1975. Just hours before the Indonesian invasion of East Timor (now Timor Leste) on December 7, 1975, Ford and Kissinger had visited Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta and guaranteed American compliance with the Indonesian operation. Suharto had been a key supporter of American influence in Indonesia and Southeast Asia and Ford did not desire to place pressure on the American-Indonesian relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, &quot;A History of Modern Indonesia since c. 1200&quot;, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ford, a policy of arms sales to the Suharto regime began in 1975, before the invasion. &quot;Roughly 90%&quot; of the Indonesian army's weapons at the time of East Timor's invasion were provided by the U.S. according to George H. Aldrich, a former State Department deputy legal advisor.&lt;ref&gt;1977 hearing of the House International Relations Committee&lt;/ref&gt; Post-invasion, Ford's military aid averaged about $30 million annually throughout [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|East Timor's occupation]], and arms sales increased exponentially under President Carter. This policy continued until 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: U.S. Arms Transfers to Indonesia 1975-1997 - World Policy Institute - Research Project|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms/reports/indoarms.html|website=World Policy Institute|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford faced two assassination attempts during his presidency. In [[Sacramento, California]], on September 5, 1975, [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme]], a follower of [[Charles Manson]], pointed a [[M1911 Colt pistol|Colt .45-caliber handgun]] at Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1975/Ford-Assasinations-Attempts/12305821478075-12/ |title=1975 Year in Review: Ford Assassinations Attempts |publisher=Upi.com |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Fromme pulled the trigger, [[Larry Buendorf]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1026_041026_tv_secret_service2_2.html &quot;Election Is Crunch Time for U.S. Secret Service&quot;].

In reaction to this attempt, the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later. As he left the [[St. Francis Hotel]] in downtown San Francisco, [[Sara Jane Moore]], standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, pointed her [[.38 Special|.38-caliber revolver]] at him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Secret Service&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/ustreas/usss/t1pubrpt.html |title=Public Report of the White House Security Review |author=United States Secret Service |accessdate=January 3, 2007|publisher=United States Department of the Treasury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore fired a single round but missed because the sights were off. Just before she fired a second round, retired Marine [[Oliver Sipple]] grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot; the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of Ford's head, then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver, who was slightly wounded. Moore was later sentenced to life in prison. She was paroled on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC7-Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=local&amp;id=4900159|title=Interview: Woman Who Tried To Assassinate Ford|accessdate=January 3, 2007|last=Lee|first=Vic|date=January 2, 2007|publisher=KGO-TV|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. Former [[Governor of California]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and the party's [[American conservatism|conservative]] wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in [[South Vietnam]], for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the [[Panama Canal]]. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]].) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous [[United States presidential primary|primaries]], including [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Indiana]], and [[California]], but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the [[1976 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more [[American liberalism|liberal]] Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/back.time/9603/29/index.shtml Another Loss For the Gipper].

In addition to the pardon dispute and lingering anti-Republican sentiment, Ford had to counter a plethora of negative media imagery. [[Chevy Chase]] often did [[pratfall]]s on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', imitating Ford, who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term. As Chase commented, &quot;He even mentioned in his own autobiography it had an effect over a period of time that affected the election to some degree.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-19-2004/0002287784&amp;EDATE= VH1 News Presents: Politics: A Pop Culture History Premiering Wednesday, October 20 at 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm (ET/PT)].

Ford's 1976 election campaign benefitted from his being an incumbent president during several anniversary events held during the period leading up to the [[United States Bicentennial]]. The Washington, D.C. [[fireworks]] display on the [[Fourth of July]] was presided over by the President and televised nationally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090304025818/http://www.c-span.org/classroom/govt/1976.asp Election of 1976: A Political Outsider Prevails].

The 200th anniversary of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in Massachusetts gave Ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to 110,000 in Concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for &quot;reconciliation, not recrimination&quot; and &quot;reconstruction, not rancor&quot; between the United States and those who would pose &quot;threats to peace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shabecoff, Philip. &quot;160,000 Mark Two 1775 Battles; Concord Protesters Jeer Ford – Reconciliation Plea&quot;, ''The New York Times'', April 20, 1975, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in New Hampshire on the previous day, Ford condemned the growing trend toward big government bureaucracy and argued for a return to &quot;basic American virtues&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shabecoff, Philip. &quot;Ford, on Bicentennial Trip, Bids U.S. Heed Old Values&quot;, ''The New York Times'', April 19, 1975, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic nominee and former [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]] [[Jimmy Carter]] campaigned as an outsider and reformer, gaining support from voters dismayed by the [[Watergate scandal]] and Nixon pardon. After the Democratic National Convention, he held a huge 33-point lead over Ford in the polls. However, as the campaign continued, the race tightened, and, by election day, the polls showed the race as too close to call. There were three main events in the fall campaign. Most importantly, Carter repeated a promise of a &quot;blanket pardon&quot; for Christian and other religious refugees, and also all Vietnam War draft dodgers (Ford had only issued a conditional amnesty) in response to a question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates, an act which froze Ford's poll numbers in Ohio, Wisconsin, Hawaii, and Mississippi. (Ford had needed to shift just 11,000 votes in Ohio plus one of the other three in order to win.) It was the first act signed by Carter, on January 20, 1977. Earlier, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine had published a controversial interview with Carter; in the interview Carter admitted to having &quot;lusted in my heart&quot; for women other than his wife, which cut into his support among women and evangelical Christians. Also, on September 24, Ford performed well in what was the first televised [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debate]] since [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]]. Polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that Ford was the winner. Carter was also hurt by Ford's charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader, and that Carter was vague on many issues.

Televised [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debates]] were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they &quot;gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer&quot;. The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, &quot;There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration.&quot; Ford also said that he did not &quot;believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1976/|title=1976 Presidential Debates|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the ''spirits'' of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner [[Max Frankel]] was visibly incredulous at the response.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Lehrer|first=Jim|year=2000 |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/dod/1976-broadcast.html |title=1976:No Audio and No Soviet Domination |work=Debating Our Destiny|publisher=PBS|accessdate=March 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this blunder, and Carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the Vietnam era during the presidential debates, Ford's surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.

[[File:ElectoralCollege1976.svg|right|thumb|275px|1976 electoral vote results.]]

In the end, Carter won the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote and 297 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford. The election was close enough that had fewer than 25,000 votes shifted in [[Ohio]] and [[Wisconsin]] – both of which neighbored his home state – Ford would have won the electoral vote with 276 votes to 261 for Carter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multied.com/elections/1976state.html &quot;Presidential Election 1976 States Carried&quot;]. multied.com. Retrieved December 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he lost, in the three months between the Republican National Convention and the election Ford had managed to close what was once an alleged 33-point Carter lead to a 2-point margin. Ford carried 27 states versus 23 carried by Carter.

Had Ford won the election, the provisions of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]] would have disqualified him from running in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], because he had served more than two years of Nixon's remaining term.

==Post-presidential years, 1977–2006==

===Activity===
The Nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided. Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugural address]] by praising the outgoing President, saying, &quot;For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=January 20, 1977|url=http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres60.html|title=Jimmy Carter |work=U.S. Inaugural Addresses|publisher=Bartleby.com|accessdate=August 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford remained relatively active in the years after his presidency. He continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of [[Eisenhower Fellowships]] in [[Philadelphia]], then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Perrone, Marguerite. &quot;Eisenhower Fellowship: A History 1953–2003&quot;. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a ''New York Times'' journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;poynterX&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Naughton |first=James M |date=December 27, 2006 |url=http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=115796|title=The Real Jerry Ford |publisher=PoynterOnline |accessdate=March 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, ''A Time to Heal'' (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in ''Foreign Affairs'' described it as, &quot;Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Gaddis|title=A Time to Heal|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|year=1979|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19790901fabook14015/gerald-r-ford/a-time-to-heal.html|accessdate=April 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the term of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of [[Anwar el-Sadat]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Kornblut |first=Anne |date=December 29, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/washington/29funeral.html?ex=1325048400&amp;en=44d6cd10bbdba342&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Ford Arranged His Funeral to Reflect Himself and Drew in a Former Adversary |work=The New York Times |accessdate=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]], visited the Fords' home frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Updegrove|first = Mark K.|title = Flying Coach to Cairo|magazine = American Heritage|volume = 57|issue = 4|date = August–September 2006|url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/%E2%80%9Cflying-coach-cairo%E2%80%9D|accessdate = September 28, 2011|quote=&quot;Certainly few observers in January 1977 would have predicted that Jimmy and I would become the closest of friends,&quot; Ford said in 2000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the [[National Commission on Federal Election Reform]] in 2001 and of the [[Continuity of Government Commission]] in 2002.

Like Presidents Carter, George H. W. Bush, and [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], Ford was an honorary co-chair of the [[Council for Excellence in Government]], a group dedicated to excellence in government performance, which provides leadership training to top federal employees.

In retirement Ford also devoted much time to his love of golf, often playing both privately and in public events with comedian [[Bob Hope]], a longtime friend. In 1977, he shot a [[hole in one]] during a Pro-am held in conjunction with the [[Danny Thomas Memphis Classic]] at [[Colonial Country Club (Memphis)|Colonial Country Club]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

Ford considered a run for the Republican nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], foregoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with Carter. Ford attacked Carter's conduct of the SALT II negotiations and foreign policy in the Middle East and Africa. Many have argued that Ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an &quot;Accidental President&quot; and to win a term in his own right. Ford also believed the more conservative Ronald Reagan would be unable to defeat Carter and would hand the incumbent a second term. Ford was encouraged by his former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger as well as [[Jim Rhodes]] of Ohio and [[Bill Clements]] of Texas to make the race. On March 15, 1980, Ford announced that he would forgo a run for the Republican nomination, vowing to support the eventual nominee.

After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented &quot;co-presidency&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;meeteye&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomas|first=Evan |year=2007 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56688 |title=The 38th President: More Than Met the Eye|work=Newsweek |accessdate=January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and [[Alan Greenspan]] as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Richard V.

After his presidency, Ford joined the [[American Enterprise Institute]] as a distinguished fellow. He founded the annual [[AEI World Forum]] in 1982. Ford was awarded an [[List of recipients of honorary degrees from Central Connecticut State University|honorary doctorate at Central Connecticut State University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15404901&amp;BRD=1641&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=17739&amp;rfi=6|title=A $3m gift |last=Whipple|first=Scott|date=October 18, 2005|work=The New Britain Herald|accessdate=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 23, 1988.

After leaving the White House, Ford and his wife moved to Denver, Colorado.

While vacationing in [[Vail, Colorado]], Ford was hospitalized for two days in July 2006 for shortness of breath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14043669/ &quot;Gerald Ford released from hospital&quot;].

On August 28, Ford was released from the hospital and returned with his wife Betty to their California home. On October 13, he was scheduled to attend the dedication of a building of his namesake, the [[Gerald R.

{{Main article|Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford}}
Ford died on December 26, 2006, at his home in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], of arteriosclerotic [[cerebrovascular disease]] and diffuse [[arteriosclerosis]]. He had end-stage coronary artery disease and severe [[aortic stenosis]] and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrank T: Write It When I'm Gone, G. Putnam &amp; Sons, New York, NY, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ford died on the 34th anniversary of President [[Harry Truman]]'s death; he was the last surviving member of the [[Warren Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;preseulog&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/02/world/americas/02iht-web.0207ford.4080367.html|title=Bush and ex-presidents eulogize Gerald R.

On December 30, 2006, Ford became the 11th U.S. President to [[Lying in state#United States|lie in state]]. A state funeral and memorial services was held at the [[National Cathedral]] in Washington, D.C., on January 2, 2007. After the service, Ford was interred at his [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum|Presidential Museum]] in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ford Is Buried After Thousands in Hometown Pay Respects|work=The New York Times|date=January 4, 2007|accessdate=October 16, 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/washington/04ford.html?pagewanted=print|first=Monica|last=Davey}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Along motorcade route 904.jpg|thumb|left|Citizens lining outside of the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum]] in [[Grand Rapids, MI]] during a public visitation of Ford.]]
Scouting was so important to Ford that his family asked that Scouts participate in his funeral. A few selected Scouts served as ushers inside the National Cathedral. About 400 Eagle Scouts were part of the funeral procession, where they formed an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0703/a-ford.html|title=Eagle Scout Welcome Gerald Ford Home|last=Ray|first=Mark|year=2007|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|work=Scouting Magazine|accessdate=March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford selected the song to be played during his funeral procession at the U.S. Capitol.&lt;ref&gt;Anne E. Kornblut, &quot;Ford Arranged His Funeral to Reflect Himself and Drew in a Former Adversary&quot;, ''The New York Times'', December 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death in December 2006, the [[University of Michigan Marching Band]] played the school's fight song for him one final time, for his last ride from the [[Gerald R.

The State of Michigan commissioned and submitted a statue of Ford to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], replacing [[Zachariah Chandler]]. It was unveiled on May 3, 2011 in the Capitol Rotunda. On the proper right side is inscribed a quotation from a tribute by Thomas P. &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill, Speaker of the House at the end of Ford's presidency: &quot;God has been good to America, especially during difficult times. At the time of the Civil War, he gave us Abraham Lincoln. And at the time of Watergate, he gave us Gerald Ford—the right man at the right time who was able to put our nation back together again.&quot; On the proper left side are words from Ford's swearing-in address: &quot;Our constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule.&quot;

Ford's wife, Betty Ford, died on July 8, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43692691/?gt1=43001|title=Former first lady Betty Ford dies at 93|date=July 9, 2011|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like her husband, she was 93 years old when she died.

===Longevity===
On November 12, 2006, upon surpassing Ronald Reagan's lifespan, Ford released his last public statement:{{Quote|The length of one's days matters less than the love of one's family and friends. I thank God for the gift of every sunrise and, even more, for all the years He has blessed me with Betty and the children; with our extended family and the friends of a lifetime. That includes countless Americans who, in recent months, have remembered me in their prayers. Your kindness touches me deeply. May God bless you all and may God bless America.&lt;ref name=EclipseReagan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-11-10-ford_x.htm|title=Ford eclipses Reagan as oldest ex-president |date=November 12, 2006|work=USA Today|accessdate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Ford's age at the time of his death was 93 years and 165 days, making him the [[List of United States Presidents by age|longest-lived U.S. President]], his lifespan being 45 days longer than Ronald Reagan's.&lt;ref name=&quot;deathofford&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/washington/27webford.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;ex=1167282000&amp;en=8487|title=Gerald Ford, 38th President, Dies at 93|date=December 27, 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 19, 2009|author1=James M.

Morton]], 96. Ford also had the third-longest post-presidency (29 years and 11 months) after [[Jimmy Carter]] ({{age in years and months|1981|1|20}} and counting) and [[Herbert Hoover]] (31 years and 7 months)

Ford was the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice-president. The choice of Ford to fulfill [[Spiro Agnew]]'s vacated role as vice president was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty.&lt;ref name=sacrifice&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston/News/30916-Gerald-Ford-Bettys-husband/|title=Gerald Ford, Betty's Husband|accessdate=December 4, 2009|publisher=The Phoenix Media/Communications Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word,&quot; said [[Martha Griffiths]].&lt;ref name=publicimage/&gt;

The trust the American people had in him was rapidly and severely tarnished by his pardon of Nixon.&lt;ref name=publicimage&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/presidents/gerald-r-ford-1451818.html|title=Gerald R Ford|accessdate=December 2, 2009|work=The Independent | location=London | date=January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, many grant in hindsight that he had respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility that he had not sought.&lt;ref name=publicimage/&gt; His subsequent loss to Carter in 1976 has come to be seen as an honorable sacrifice he made for the nation.&lt;ref name=sacrifice/&gt;

In spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy, likable, and simple-minded Everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting the presidential jet in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by [[Chevy Chase]], cementing Ford's image as a klutz.&lt;ref name=publicimage/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Honors==
[[File:Gerald Ford2-41c.jpg|thumb|Ford honored on [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States|U.S Postage]], issue of 2007]]
Ford received the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] in May 1970, as well as the [[Silver Buffalo Award]], from the Boy Scouts of America.
