      <comment>Its not a matter of where it took place. Its a matter of who lead and primarily won the military offensive. Per the cited sources, it was Hezbollah while the Army was in a supporting role.</comment>

==Background==
{{main|Battle of Qalamoun|Qalamoun offensive (June–August 2014)}}

In mid-November 2013, the Syrian military, backed by Hezbollah, launched an offensive against the rebel-held [[Qalamun Mountains]] in an attempt to cut rebel supply lines to Damascus from Lebanon.&lt;ref name=&quot;fierce&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/11/fierce-syria-clashes-spark-exodus-lebanon-2013111712321697322.html |title=Fierce Syria clashes spark exodus to Lebanon |publisher=Al Jazeera }}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic region had been used by rebel forces as a rear base for its operations around the capital [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/syria-air-force-bombards-town-near-lebanon-monitor.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=58038&amp;NewsCatID=352 |title=Syria air force bombards town near Lebanon: monitor |work=Hürriyet Daily News }}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was primarily led on the rebel side by the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isisjoins&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/03/04/6207631/isis-joins-other-rebels-to-thwart.html|title=ISIS joins other rebels to thwart Syria regime push near Lebanon|publisher=McClatchy|date=4 March 2014|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late April 2014, the last major rebel stronghold in the region fell to the Syrian Army, as it secured all of the towns in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;surrender&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/04/syria-rebels-surrender-border-town-2014426152724543924.html|title=Syria rebels surrender in border town |publisher= |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 3,000 rebels retreated into the mountains to conduct guerrilla hit-and-run attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Commentary/2014/Jul-02/262316-events-in-iraq-makes-hezbollah-vulnerable.ashx#axzz39B6nb6Tv |title=Events in Iraq makes Hezbollah vulnerable |work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From June through August 2014, a new Syrian government offensive against remnant rebel forces led to the rebels coming under siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/Jul-31/265551-hezbollah-syrian-regime-battle-rebels-in-northeast-lebanon.ashx#axzz391ZPEA4f|title=Hezbollah, Syrian regime battle rebels in northeast Lebanon |work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following months, the al-Nusra Front and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] maintained a foothold in the region's rugged terrain. Over 20 FSA factions merged into the [[Gathering of Western Qalamoun]] group, while by the end of the year, six eastern Qalamoun FSA brigades formed the Mujahideen Shura Council.&lt;ref name=QaO&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/syrian-jihadists-signal-intent-lebanon |title=Syrian Jihadists Signal Intent for Lebanon|work=ISW|date=6 March 2015 |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the arrival of an ISIL expeditionary force lead to a wave of FSA defections into ISIL numbering in the hundreds, further boosting the Islamic State's presence in the region, which reached approximately 1,000 fighters. Al-Nusra maintained 600 militants in Qalamoun's eastern areas, forging an alliance with ISIL in the region.&lt;ref name=QaO/&gt;

==The offensive==

===Prelude===
Between 25 and 28 March 2015, the Syrian Army and Hezbollah captured two hills near the town of [[Flitah]] and several others in the Zabadani region. The fighting left 30 rebels dead. The Lebanese Army seized some positions on the outskirts of [[Arsal]] from jihadist fighters.&lt;ref name=twohilltopos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicresistance.net/2015/03/syrian-army-hezbollah-seize-two-hilltops-near-border/|title=Syrian Army, Hezbollah seize two hilltops near border|date=25 March 2015|work=Electronic Resistance|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Mar-28/292457-army-seizes-hilltops-from-militants-in-dawn-raid.ashx|title=Army seizes hilltops from militants in dawn raid|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 3 April, the Syrian military had advanced on three axes towards Zabadani, securing the western and eastern approaches to the city, and relatively paralyzing the defending rebels. Fifteen al-Nusra fighters attempting to reinforce the rebels in Zabadani were killed trying to breach the cordon.&lt;ref name=kidnapped&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2015/04/arsal-islamic-state-zabadani-nusra-kidnap.html|title=Arsal officials negotiate for kidnapped resident - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-April, opposition forces captured a strategic hill overlooking Flita that had been held by Hezbollah fighters.&lt;ref name=hezbollahposition&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Apr-13/294260-syria-rebels-seize-hezbollah-position-near-lebanon-border-sources.ashx |title= Syria rebels seize Hezbollah position near Lebanon border: sources |last1= |first1= |publisher= The Daily Star  |date= 13 April 2015 |accessdate= 13 April 2015 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Hezbollah was preparing for a new offensive, considered to be a decisive battle for Qalamoun,&lt;ref name=twohilltopos/&gt; while the rebels were making efforts to unite different warring opposition groups in an effort to take control of the Qalamoun region.&lt;ref name=hezbollahposition/&gt; However, ISIL and al-Nusra were still competing to win over communities in the Arsal area and the rebels in both Zabadani’s mountains range and in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains switched from offense to defense. They were preparing trenches, tunnels, bunkers, and barricades, in anticipation of a possible battle in the spring.&lt;ref name=kidnapped/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{main|Battle of Zabadani (2015)}}
On 23 June, the 20th and 128th Brigades of the Syrian Army's 1st Armored Division, in coordination with Hezbollah and the NDF, advanced to the Jaroud Qarah area and launched an assault on ISIL defensive positions, which was the last ISIL-controlled part of the Qalamoun mountains in Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;jaroudqarah&quot;/&gt;

On 4 July, Hezbollah and the Syrian Army launched an offensive against Zabadani&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/07/04/Syrian-army-and-Hezbollah-launch-major-assault-on-border-city-.html|title=Syrian army, Hezbollah lay siege to Zabadani|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 15 July, they were advancing towards the town's center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN0PP1U720150715|title=Syrian army, Hezbollah advance in city near Lebanese border|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had effectively encircled rebel forces in Zabadani.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-and-hezbollah-on-the-edge-of-downtown-al-zabadani|title=Syrian Army and Hezbollah on the Edge of Downtown Al-Zabadani|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September, a ceasefire was signed between the warring parties upon which the rebels would withdraw from Al-Zabadani within a six-month period, while surrendering all heavy weaponry. The agreement would be overseen by the United Nations office in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Sep-24/316543-hezbollah-syria-army-reach-deal-with-rebels-on-fate-of-zabadani-idlib-towns-sources.ashx|title=Syria army, rebels reach deal on Zabadani, Idlib villages: source|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/09/sponsored-by-the-turkish-and-iranian-and-the-guarantee-of-the-international-envoy-the-terms-of-the-agreement-about-zabadani-and-kafrayya-and-al-fouaa-and-their-surroundings|title=Sponsored by the Turkish and Iranian and the guarantee of the international envoy, the terms of the agreement about Zabadani and Kafrayya and al-Fou’aa and their surroundings|author=Edward|work=Syrian Observatory For Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/warring-sides-in-syria-reach-deal-on-al-zabadani-kefraya-al-fouaa|title=Warring Sides in Syria Reach Deal on Al-Zabadani, Kefraya, Al-Fou'aa|author=News Desk|date=25 September 2015|work=Al-Masdar News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the implementation of the ceasefire, the besieging Hezbollah and the SAA troops redirected their attention towards the remaining parts of the Qalamoun Mountains still under rebel control, namely a smaller area in the Jaroud Rankous, located in southern Qalamoun, and larger area located in Jaroud Qarah, in northern Qalamoun. The Hezbollah also set itself out to recapture the Lebanese border-district of [[Arsal]], from where the Jabhat Al-Nusra and ISIL have been receiving much of its reinforcement into the Qalamoun Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/hezbollah-prepares-for-the-final-showdown-in-the-qalamoun-mountains/|title=Hezbollah Prepares for the Final Showdown in the Qalamoun Mountains|author=Leith Fadel|date=29 September 2015|work=Al-Masdar News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic analysis==
Sami Nader, a professor in politics at the University of Saint Joseph in Lebanon stated regarding Iranian and Hezbollah involvement in the offensive; &quot;they are in desperate need for an achievement to counter balance their losses; they need to sell it to their constituents in order to justify the continuing battle and involvement in Syria&quot; adding that &quot;Qalamoun is more of a media campaign than a real battle on the ground&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/05/nasrallah-declares-victory-syria-qalamoun-150516192033488.html |title= Nasrallah declares victory in Syria's Qalamoun
