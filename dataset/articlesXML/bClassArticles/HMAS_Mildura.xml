'''HMAS ''Mildura'' (J207/M207)''', named for the city of [[Mildura, Victoria]], was one of 60 [[Bathurst-class corvette|''Bathurst''-class corvettes]] constructed during [[World War II]], and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). The ship was laid down by [[Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co]] in 1940 and commissioned into the RAN in 1941.

''Mildura''{{'}}s initial deployments were on the east coast of Australia as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol vessel. At the start of 1944, she escorted vessels between [[Townsville, Queensland]] and New Guinea. Late 1944 saw the ship relocated to [[Fremantle, Western Australia]] as a local patrol ship. After a refit at the start of 1945, ''Mildura'' was based at [[Morotai]], and operated throughout the [[Dutch East Indies]] until August, when the corvette was sent to clear Hong Kong waters of mines. During September and October, the mine warfare area increased to include Chinese waters. In late October, ''Mildura'' returned to Sydney for refitting, then spent the next two years clearing mines around Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.

The corvette was [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1948, but was recommissioned in 1951 to serve as a training vessel for [[National Service Act 1951|National Service trainees]]. ''Mildura'' was decommissioned again in 1953, then was towed to Brisbane for use as a [[training hulk]] for local [[Royal Australian Naval Reserve|reservists]]. The ship was sold for scrap in 1965.

==Design and construction==
{{main|Bathurst-class corvette}}
In 1938, the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board]] (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.&lt;ref name=Hindsight1&gt;Stevens, ''The Australian Corvettes'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StevensACV103&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel was initially envisaged as having a [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least {{convert|10|kn}}, and a range of {{convert|2000|nmi}}&lt;ref name=StevensACV103.4&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt; The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled [[Bar-class boom defence vessel]] saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a {{convert|15.5|kn}} top speed, and a range of {{convert|2850|nmi}}, armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with [[asdic]], and able to be fitted with either [[depth charge]]s or [[Naval mine#Mine sweeping|minesweeping]] equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.&lt;ref name=Hindsight1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', pp. 103–5&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the prototype {{HMAS|Kangaroo||6}} did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.&lt;ref name=StevensACV104&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including ''Mildura'') ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the [[British Admiralty]] but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the [[Royal Indian Navy]].&lt;ref name=Hindsight1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', pp. 105, 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Donohue29&gt;Donohue, ''From Empire Defence to the Long Haul'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevens108&gt;Stevens et al., ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RAN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-mildura |title=HMAS Mildura |accessdate=26 March 2015 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As constructed, ''Mildura'' displaced 650 tons, with a length of {{convert|186|ft}}, a beam of {{convert|31|ft}}, and a draught of {{convert|8|ft|6|in}}.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; the propulsion system consisted of a single [[triple expansion steam engine]], which supplied {{convert|1,750|hp}} to two propeller shafts.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; Maximum speed was {{convert|15|kn}}.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; Main armament for the corvette consisted of one 4-inch high-angle gun, supplemented by three [[20 mm Oerlikon cannon]]s (one of which was later replaced by a [[40 mm Bofors]] gun), plus machine guns.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; Depth charge chutes and throwers were also fitted.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; The ship's company consisted of 85 personnel.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;

''Mildura'' was laid down by [[Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co]] in Sydney on 23 September 1940.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; She was launched on 15 March 1941 by the wife of Commodore [[John Walter Durnford]], the Second Naval Member of the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board]], and commissioned on 23 July 1941.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;

==Operational history==
''Mildura'' was initially assigned to the [[20th Minesweeping Flotilla]] until its disbandment in late 1941.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; The ship then operated independently on minesweeping, convoy escort, and anti-submarine patrols throughout Australian and South Pacific waters.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; In September 1942, ''Mildura'' was reassigned as a dedicated escort vessel for merchant convoys on the eastern Australian coast.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; In January 1943, the corvette recovered and towed the American merchant ship {{SS|Peter Burnett}} after the latter was torpedoed off Sydney.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; On 8 February, {{SS|Iron Knight|1937|6}} was torpedoed while part of a convoy escorted by ''Mildura''.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; In January 1944, ''Mildura'' was reassigned to patrol duties in Queensland waters, with regular detachments to escort convoys between [[Townsville]] and New Guinea.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; This continued until August 1944, when the corvette was relocated to Western Australia and assigned to patrols of the vicinity around [[Fremantle]].&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;

At the start of 1945, ''Mildura'' was refitted, then in March assigned to [[Morotai]].&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; The ship's main roles were to patrol the vicinity of the island, and to shepherd convoys between Morotai and [[Biak]].&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; On 22 June, the ship was sent to Borneo to provide nighttime patrols of [[Tarakan]] Harbour's approaches.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; She was reassigned back to Morotai at the end of June.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; During the return voyage, the ship diverted after spotting a crashed [[PBY Catalina]] on [[Makheli Island]].&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; A group of natives reported that the aircrew had been rescued by another aircraft, but requested that they themselves be evacuated because they had come to the attention of the Japanese.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; The six natives were transported to Morotai.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;

After spending July based in Morotai, followed by two weeks as guardship at [[Balikpapan]], ''Mildura'' met seven other ''Bathurst''-class corvettes at [[Subic Bay]], then proceeded as a group to sweep Hong Kong waters of mines from 30 August.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; Other duties the corvette was involved in during the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong#End of Japanese occupation|Japanese surrender of Hong Kong]] included patrols, the pursuit and seizure of small craft, and overseeing the transfer of the Hong Kong brewery from Japanese to Allied hands.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; In mid-September, the Hong Kong minesweeping force was rolled into the [[21st Minesweeping Flotilla]], which was tasked with clearing Chinese waters of mines.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; This continued until 17 October, and on 20 October, ''Mildura'' departed Hong Kong for Sydney.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; She arrived on 19 November and was docked for refit until February 1946.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; ''Mildura'' joined the [[20th Minesweeping Flotilla]] in clearing mines around Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands until October 1947.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; The corvette received two [[battle honour]]s for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1941–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;.&lt;ref name=newhonours&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |title=Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613184920/http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |archivedate=13 June 2011 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=honourslist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |title=Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614064156/http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mildura'' was [[paid off]] to reserve at [[Fremantle, Western Australia]] on 21 May 1948 but was recommissioned on 20 February 1951 for use as a training ship for [[National Service Act 1951|National Service trainees]].&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; She continued in this role until 1953.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;

==Decommissioning and fate==
''Mildura'' paid off again at Melbourne on 11 September 1953.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; The ship was towed to Brisbane by {{HMAS|Sprightly}} in December, and on arrival was designated as a [[training hulk]] for [[Royal Australian Naval Reserve|reservists]].&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; The ship was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] to Brisbane Non-Ferrous on 8 September 1965.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;
