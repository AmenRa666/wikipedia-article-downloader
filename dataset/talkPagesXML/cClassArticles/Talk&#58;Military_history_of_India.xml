== Who wrote the &quot;Opposition:Indian National Army&quot; piece==
It's filled with baseless facts and talks about Sikhs. This is a piece on Azad Hind Fauj. I deleted the article and entered a few bits. I'll expand it considerably over the few days.

For the person who's responsible for this : What's your point ? Ok, What if Sikhs were part of the AHF. AHF was filled with Volunteers, Indian PoWs and German and Japanese Forces. Your argument is baseless and provides no sources.

I know mine (the piece I wrote) sounds a bit rusty, but give me a few days (or weeks)--[[User:Milki|Milki]] 17:24, 1 October 2006 (UTC)


== This article ==

Im sorry to be so harsh but this article is a disgrace, its has nothing on WWI and WII and badly set out. I may nominate this for improvement drive [[User:CooldogCongo|CooldogCongo]] 11:56, 18 July 2005 (UTC)


::note 8/22/05 I agree, I just did the Sepoy portion i'll do more later::

Agreed. Inaccuracies, bad grammar, and shoddy spelling abound. Can we put up a &quot;cleanup&quot; tag on this somehow?


I caught some bad grammar, fixed it; I'll definitely be taking a look at the article and adding some more information. I would encourage others to do the same.

== Subarticles ==

6000 years of claimed military history can't be put into one little article. This can at best be an overview. I've sectioned it up. Anyone interested should start up separate articles for each section, and then come back
to this overview and fill in a para or so as an abstract of the detailed article. [[User:158.144.51.19|158.144.51.19]] 18:05, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

== Military Establishments ==

We need to ask [[User:Sunder|Sunder]] for some help here. When we say Military history, we need to give a little stress on the current and '''Post Independence''' period. Then cone [[DRDO]], [[DLRL]], [[BEL]], etc..--[[User:Krishnavedala|Davy Jones]] 21:29, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

== Note by Bhaskar ==

(moved from article space)
:::Note by Bhaskar:::Even as an Indian I found this last passage in correct in many respects and also very pro-Indian, FIRST OF ALL INDIA HAS THE 3rd largest military behind China and the United States, just trailing the latter.

Also I really hate the comments about the ISI and &quot;Pakistan's hostilites&quot; since its not substantiated by any fact

== Kingdom of Mysore ==

Too lazy to add to the article, so adding it here: [[Hyder Ali]] was also instructed by French military officers &amp; he was one of the first Indian rulers to use rockets. See http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/FactSheets/rkhist.htm

== Under Aryans ==

Hi,

I deleted the sentence regarding the Rig Veda talking about the subjugation of local people, since there is no such mention there. And if you disagree with me, I would like the one who posted the sentence to post those verses here.

==Battles Against Europeans==

During the early colonial time (1500-1800) India (atleast in the South) had many victories against Europeans. Did Indians use firearms in this period or did they win with some other weapon? [[User:Zachorious|Zachorious]] 18:23, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

::Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan (and other Muslim Rulers) might've used Fire Arms. But most Hindu Rulers (with notable exceptions) stuck with traditional weapons--[[User:Milki|Milki]] 17:26, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

== Imaginative terms ==

Imaginative terms have no place in wikipedia and they are removed. These kind of imaginations even did not provide any kind of infomation from any sources.
--[[User:Chanakyathegreat|Chanakyathegreat]] 18:04, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

==Sino-Indian war, 1962 ==

This section is highly POV and does not contain any sources. I'll remove it until someone fixes it. Thanks [[User:216.99.61.249|216.99.61.249]] 01:05, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

== Article needs a major clean up! ==

Kargil war was not a brief border skirmish! It lasted 50 days and captured the attention of the entire world.
No doubt sikhs are brave soldiers and have proved themselves again and again despite unimaginable odds. But they represent a small fraction of the Indian armed forces. Such biased coverage is not healthy. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/219.91.211.70|219.91.211.70]] ([[User talk:219.91.211.70|talk]]) 10:15, 21 January 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

== Asian Indian American service during World War II ==

I am looking for assistance in finding [[WP:CITE|references]] regarding [[Indian American|Asian Indian Americans]] during [[World War II]].  During the [http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/41271189.pdf 1940 US Census] &quot;Hindu Americans&quot; were the fourth largest group of [[Asian American]]s after the [[Japanese American|Japanese]], [[Chinese American|Chinese]], and [[Filipino American|Filipinos]].  So far I have not found significant sources which to create a paragraph for Indian Americans in the article [[Military History of Asian Americans]].  If anyone would like to assist, they can place references they find on [[Talk:Military History of Asian Americans|the article's talk page]].  Thank you in advance. --[[User:RightCowLeftCoast|RightCowLeftCoast]] ([[User talk:RightCowLeftCoast|talk]]) 10:59, 19 November 2009 (UTC)

== Lead requires cleaning up ==

The lead is unbalanced. There are far too many names of dynasties and no mention of the military exploits of each. Any ideas for cleanup are welcome. I intend to begin in a few days time. [[User:AshLin|AshLin]] ([[User talk:AshLin|talk]]) 05:03, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

== Copy edit ==

I've just finished copy editing the article. It needs more sources; right now there are entire sections with nary a footnote in sight. Content-wise, it needs much more discussion of the colonial period and some general fleshing-out in all sections. What I know about the subject I know from this copy edit, so I'm not a good candidate to do this. Best wishes.

== Mughal Empire image ==

I've restored the original image of a Mughal cavalryman. This image shows a lot of details of the soldier's equipment that one couldn't really get from the new image. [[User:Lagrange613|Lagrange]][[User talk:Lagrange613#top|613]] 15:35, 20 October 2011 (UTC)

== No mention of Ahom Kingdom ==
This article has no mention of the Ahom Kingdom, which ruled significant portions of today's North East India. Most importantly Ahoms are considered significant in India's history because they were able to rule themselves and maintain their independence for almost 600 years. Despite repeated attempts by the Mughals, Ahoms did not become a Mughal vassal and successfully resisted the Mughal might. Ahom Kingdom's lack of mention on this page somehow indicates double standards and a one-sided approach. Hence I am adding it. Credible evidences about Ahom Kingdom mentioned hereby:

==Maratha Navy==
Currently the naval arm of the Marathas has no mention at all, which certainly deserves a mention. Hence I am adding it (under ''Maratha Empire''). Kindly do not make changes without discussing on talk page.
