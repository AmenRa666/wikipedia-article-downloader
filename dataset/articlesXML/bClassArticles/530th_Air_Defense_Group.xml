The '''530th Air Defense Group'''  is a disbanded [[United States Air Force]] organization. Its last assignment was with the [[9th Aerospace Defense Division|9th Air Division]] at [[Geiger Field]], Washington. It was inactivated on 18 August 1955.  The [[group (military aviation unit)|group]] was originally activated as a support unit for the [[301st Bombardment Group]] at the end of [[World War II]] in Italy and then redeployed to the United States where it continued to support the 301st until it was inactivated in 1945.

The group was activated once again in 1953, when ADC established it as the headquarters for a dispersed [[interceptor aircraft|fighter-interceptor]] squadron and the medical, maintenance, and administrative [[squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] supporting it.  It was replaced in 1955 when ADC transferred its mission, equipment, and personnel to the [[84th Fighter Group]] in a project that replaced air defense groups commanding fighter squadrons with fighter groups with distinguished records during World War II.

==History==

===World War II===
The [[Group (military aviation unit)|group]] was first activated as the '''530th Air Service Group''' toward the end of [[World War II]] to provide support for a flying unit in Italy in 1945 as part of a reorganization of [[Army Air Forces]] (AAF) support groups in which the AAF replaced Service Groups that included personnel from other branches of the Army and supported two combat groups with Air Service Groups including only Air Corps units, it was designed to support a single combat group.&lt;ref name=coleman&gt;Coleman, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  Its 956th Air Engineering Squadron&lt;ref name=&quot;530 J45&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/102/988.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 530 Air Service Group Jun 1945|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided maintenance that was beyond the capability of the combat group, its 780th Air Materiel Squadron&lt;ref name=&quot;530 J45&quot;/&gt; handled all supply matters, and its Headquarters &amp; Base Services Squadron provided other support.&lt;ref name=coleman/&gt;  The 530th supported the [[301st Bombardment Group]] at [[Foggia]], Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;530 J45&quot;/&gt;  The group returned to the United States and briefly supported the 301st Bombardment Group again at [[Pyote Army Air Field]] before all units at Pyote were inactivated in late 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/102/989.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 530 Air Service Group Aug-Sep 1945|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 530th was disbanded in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Air Force Letter, 322 (AFOOR 887e), 8 October 1948, Subject: Disbandment of Certain Inactive Air Force Units&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War===
During the [[Cold War]] the group was reconstituted, redesignated as the '''530th Air Defense Group''', and activated at Geiger Field on 18 February 1953&lt;ref name=&quot;cj 83&quot;&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; with responsibility for air defense of the Northwestern United States.{{Citation needed|reason=need reference for area of responsibility|date=April 2012}}  The group replaced the '''87th Air Base Squadron''' as USAF host organization at Geiger Field.  It was assigned three [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s to perform its support responsibilities.&lt;ref name=cj147&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;  The organizations it supported included its headquarters, the [[4702d Defense Wing]], and later the 9th Air Division.&lt;ref name=9AD1954&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/425/778.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 9 Air Division Oct-Dec 1954|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Its first operational squadron, the [[440th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] (FIS), was activated at Geiger two days later&lt;ref name=&quot;M CS 545&quot;&gt;Maurer, p. 545&lt;/ref&gt; flying airborne intercept [[radar]] equipped and [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|Mighty Mouse rocket]] armed [[North American F-86D Sabre]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1953, a second F-86D squadron, the [[445th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron|445th FIS]] was activated at Geiger.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 551&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1954, the 440th FIS moved overseas and was reassigned away from the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;M CS 545&quot;/&gt;  In December 1954, the 530th once again had two flying squadrons, when the [[520th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron|520th FIS]], another F-86D unit,&lt;ref&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; was activated.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 624&lt;/ref&gt;    The 530th was inactivated&lt;ref name=&quot;cj 83&quot;/&gt; and replaced by the [[84th Fighter Group]] (Air Defense)&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955 as part of [[Air Defense Command]]'s Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, Sturm, Volan, &amp; McMullen, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was disbanded again in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 575q, 27 Sep 1984, Subject: Disbandment of Units&lt;/ref&gt;
