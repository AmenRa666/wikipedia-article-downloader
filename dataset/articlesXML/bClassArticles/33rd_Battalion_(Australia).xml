The '''33rd Battalion''' was an [[infantry]] [[battalion]] of the [[Australian Army]]. Formed in 1916, the battalion fought on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]]. It was disbanded after the war, but later re-raised as a part-time unit based in [[New South Wales]]. During the inter war years, it was amalgamated with other battalions a couple of times before being re-raised in its own right in 1936. During [[World War II]], the battalion remained in Australia and in 1942 was amalgamated with the [[13th Battalion (Australia)|13th Battalion]], which was disbanded the following year having not served overseas.

==History==
===World War I===
Raised for service during [[World War I]] as part of the all-volunteer [[First Australian Imperial Force|1st Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF), the 33rd Battalion was formed in Australian in January 1916 as part of an expansion of the AIF that took place after the [[Gallipoli campaign]].{{sfn|Bean|1941a|p=42}} The majority of the battalion's personnel came from the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] region of [[New South Wales]] and as a result the 33rd Battalion came to be known unofficially as &quot;New England's Own&quot;.{{sfn|Australian War Memorial||}} Along with the [[34th Battalion (Australia)|34th]], [[35th Battalion (Australia)|35th]] and [[36th Battalion (Australia)|36th Battalions]], all of which were raised from New South Wales, the 33rd formed the [[9th Brigade (Australia)|9th Brigade]] of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|Australian 3rd Division]].{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=5}} Consisting of four [[Company (military unit)|companies]], initially the battalion was formed along regional lines: 'A' Company was made from recruits drawn from [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] and [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]]; 'B' Company from [[Walcha, New South Wales|Walcha]], [[Uralla, New South Wales|Uralla]], [[Barraba, New South Wales|Barraba]], [[Bingara, New South Wales]], and [[Manilla, New South Wales|Manilla]]; 'C' Company from [[Narrabri, New South Wales|Narrabi]], [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]], and [[Inverell, New South Wales|Inverell]]; and 'D' Company from [[Glen Innes, New South Wales|Glen Innes]], [[Guyra, New South Wales|Guyra]], and [[Tenterfield, New South Wales|Tenterfield]].{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=5}} With an authorised strength of 1,023 men,{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=47}} the battalion’s first [[commanding officer]] was Lieutenant Colonel [[Leslie Morshead]], who later reached the rank of lieutenant general and commanded an Australian corps against the Japanese during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Coombes|2001|p=184}} After undertaking initial training at the showgrounds in Armidale,{{sfn|Edwards|1996|pp=5 &amp; 7}} the battalion moved to [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]], where they concentrated with the rest of the 9th Brigade.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=7}} On 3 May 1916, the battalion entrained for Sydney, where they embarked upon the HMAT ''Marathon''. Although originally it had been intended that they would go to Egypt, en route the battalion was redirected to the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|pp=9–10}}

Sailing via [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], in Western Australia, and making stops at [[Durban]], [[Cape Town]] and [[Dakar]], the battalion arrived in the United Kingdom on 9 July 1916.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=15}} Moving to [[Larkhill]], on [[Salisbury Plain]], the 33rd underwent five months of intense training along with the rest of the 3rd Division to prepare them for the rigours of war on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], before moving to France in late November, crossing the [[English Channel]] on the ferry ''Mona Queen''.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|pp=16–19}} After arriving in [[Le Havre]], in France, the battalion moved by rail to [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]], from where they marched to the front, occupying a section of the line around [[Armentières]].{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=21}} Assigned to a &quot;nursery&quot; sector, for the next month they rotated between occupying the forward trenches and undertaking training courses, as the battalion was introduced to life on the European battlefield. Although the battalion gained some experience of combat over Christmas, when they launched raids against the German lines,{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=22}} their first major battle did not come until mid-1917, by which time the focus of British operations had shifted to the [[Ypres]] sector in Belgium.{{sfn|Australian War Memorial||}}

This first battle came at [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines]] where the 33rd, along with the rest of the 9th Brigade, led the 3rd Division's assault.{{sfn|Palazzo|2002|p=33}} After a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began.{{sfn|Palazzo|2002|pp=32–33}} The 33rd went in on the right, around Ploegsteert Wood, having been chosen especially for the position due to its danger.{{sfn|Bean|1941b|p=596}} Despite suffering around 200 casualties from Allied gas-shells that had dropped short, the battalion went &quot;over the top&quot; at the appointed hour and, after skirting the large crater the mine had caused, secured their objective.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=41}} After the battle, the battalion remained at the front, holding the ground they had gained, enduring almost constant shelling.{{sfn|Australian War Memorial||}} The 33rd's casualties amounted to 92 killed in action or died of wounds, and 260 wounded; the heaviest they would suffer for the entire war.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=47}} Messines was followed by actions during the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Battle of Ypres]] in October.{{sfn|Australian War Memorial||}} Moving up to [[Zonnebeke]] on the night of 2/3 October, in the first week of the push against [[Battle of Broodseinde|Broodseinde]], they were assigned a support role as the narrowness of the front limited the role of the 3rd Division. On 12 October, the Allied attack progressed into a second phase and the 3rd Division was thrown into the assault during the [[First Battle of Passchendaele]]. Heavily depleted, with a frontage of just 242 men, they fought around Augustus Wood, where the Germans had established many pillboxes before heavy rain washed away any hope of an Allied breakthrough.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|pp=53–55}}

The following year, as the Germans launched a [[Spring Offensive|major offensive]] on the Western Front,{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=141}} they were thrust into the line in a desperate attempt to hold the line in front of the vital railhead of [[Amiens]]. There, the 33rd took part in heavy fighting when the Australians counter-attacked at Hangard Wood on 30 March, before finally turning back the German attack on [[First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux|Villers-Bretonneux]] on 4 April.{{sfn|Australian War Memorial||}}{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|pp=139–141}} At the end of the month, the battalion amalgamated with the 36th Battalion,{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=84}} as part of a general re-organisation of the AIF necessitated by heavy casualties and falling recruitment, which saw the disbandment of three battalions&amp;nbsp;– the 36th, [[47th Battalion (Australia)|47th]] and [[52nd Battalion (Australia)|52nd]]&amp;nbsp;– in order to reinforce others.{{sfn|Neillands|2004|p=493}}{{sfn|Bean|1968|p=435}} In August, the Allies launched their own offensive&amp;nbsp;– the [[Hundred Days Offensive]]&amp;nbsp;– which ultimately brought about an end to the war. The 33rd was committed to the battle on 8 August, tasked with capturing Accroche Wood.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=93}} A series of advances followed as the Allies broke through the German defences along the [[Hindenburg Line]]. After attacking around Road Wood in late August, they were withdrawn for three weeks training before taking part in a joint American-Australian attack at Bellecourt in late September.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|pp=110–111}} Following up the Americans, the 33rd held off a strong counter-attack by German forces around Gillemont Farm, before carrying out mopping-up operations towards Bony. After this, in early October, the battalion was pulled back to the [[Abbeville]] area, taking up billets in [[Citerne]], where they remained until the armistice was signed in November.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|pp=111–114}}

Following the end of hostilities, the battalion's numbers were slowly reduced as personnel were repatriated to Australia for [[demobilisation]] and finally, in May 1919, the battalion was disbanded.{{sfn|Australian War Memorial||}} During the course of the war, the 33rd Battalion lost 451 killed men and 2,052 wounded.{{sfn|Australian War Memorial||}} Two members of the battalion received the [[Victoria Cross]]: [[John Carroll (VC)|John Carroll]] and [[George Cartwright (VC)|George Cartwright]].{{sfn|Clark|1979|pp=572–573}}{{sfn|Staunton|1993|p=}} The battalion received a total of 14 battle honours, which were bestowed upon it in 1927.{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=93}}

===Inter war years and subsequent service===
After the war, when Australia's military was re-organised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF units in 1921,{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=125}} the battalion was reformed as a part-time unit of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Force]], based in the New England region, assigned to the [[1st Brigade (Australia)|1st Brigade]]. This was achieved by transferring personnel from two previously existing units: the 2nd Battalion, 33rd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment. In 1927, when territorial designations were introduced, the battalion adopted the title of the &quot;New England Regiment&quot; and the [[Latin]] motto ''Strenue Percute'' (translated ''strike vigorously''), which had previously been used by the battalion during the war, was confirmed.{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=93}}{{sfn|Armidale Express|7 September 1917|p=10}} From the outset, the Citizen Forces units were maintained through a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service; however, in 1929, the Universal Training Scheme was abolished by the [[James Scullin|Scullin]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government and replaced with an all volunteer force known as the &quot;Militia&quot;.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=125 &amp; 138}}{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=44}} This, coupled with the austerity of the [[Great Depression]], resulted in a decline of volunteers and, as a result, the 33rd Battalion was amalgamated with the [[35th Battalion (Australia)|35th Battalion]] to form the 35th/33rd Battalion.{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=93}} In 1933, the 35th/33rd was split and the 33rd joined with the [[41st Battalion (Australia)|41st Battalion]] to form the 33rd/41st Battalion. They remained linked until October 1936,{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=93}} when the 33rd Battalion was reformed in its own right as part of an expansion of Australia's military force as tensions rose in Europe, raising concerns of a future war.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=140}}

During [[World War II]], due to the provisions of the ''Defence Act'', which precluded Militia units from being sent outside Australian territory to fight,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=5}} the battalion remained in Australia undertaking garrison duties. Initially it served as part of the 1st Brigade, but in February 1942, following Japan's entry into the war, the 33rd Battalion was transferred to the [[32nd Brigade (Australia)|32nd Brigade]], which formed part of the [[Newcastle Covering Force]] that had been tasked to defend against a possible Japanese invasion.{{sfn|Orders of Battle||}} On 27 August 1942, the battalion was linked with the [[13th Battalion (Australia)|13th Battalion]] to become the 13th/33rd Battalion. It was disbanded on 25 November 1943 having not served outside Australia; the 33rd has remained off the Australian Army's order of battle since then.{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=93}} The battalion did not receive any battle honours for direct involvement in the war, but in 1961, the battalion was entrusted with the 20 battle honours earned by the [[2/33rd Battalion (Australia)|2/33rd Battalion]], which was a [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] unit that fought in [[North African campaign|North Africa]], [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Syria]] and the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]] during World War II.{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=93}}
