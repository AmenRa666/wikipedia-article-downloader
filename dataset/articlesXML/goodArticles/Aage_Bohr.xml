'''Aage Niels Bohr''' ({{IPA-da|ˈɔːʊ̯ə ˌnels ˈboɐ̯ˀ|lang|Da-Aage Niels Bohr.ogg}}; 19 June 1922 – 9 September 2009) was a Danish [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1975 with [[Ben Mottelson]] and [[James Rainwater]] &quot;for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in [[atomic nuclei]] and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nobel Prize in Physics 1975&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 1975 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | accessdate = 2015-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from Rainwater's concept of an irregular-shaped [[Semi-empirical mass formula#The liquid drop model and its analysis|liquid drop model]] of the nucleus, Bohr and Mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments. Since his father, [[Niels Bohr]], had won the prize in 1922, he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the Nobel Prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the Nobel Prize in Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/faq/questions_in_category.php?id=7#10 | title = Nobel Prize FAQ | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Aage Niels Bohr was born in [[Copenhagen]] on 19 June 1922, the fourth of six sons of the [[physicist]] [[Niels Bohr]] and his wife Margrethe Bohr (née Nørlund).&lt;ref name=&quot;Biographical&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/bohr-bio.html |title=Aage N. Bohr – Biographical |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His oldest brother, Christian, died in a boating accident in 1934,{{sfn|Stuewer|1985|p=204}} and his youngest, Harald, from childhood meningitis.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=226, 249}} Of the others, Hans became a physician; Erik, a chemical engineer; and [[Ernest Bohr|Ernest]], a lawyer and an Olympic athlete who played [[field hockey]] for Denmark at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobelprize.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Niels Bohr&amp;nbsp;– Biography|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/bohr-bio.html|publisher=[[Nobelprize.org]]|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hockey&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/bo/ernest-bohr-1.html |title=Ernest Bohr Biography and Olympic Results – Olympics |publisher=Sports-Reference.com |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived at the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the [[University of Copenhagen]], now known as the [[Niels Bohr Institute]], where he grew up surrounded by physicists who were working with his father, such as [[Hans Kramers]], [[Oskar Klein]], [[Yoshio Nishina]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biographical&quot; /&gt; In 1932, the family moved to the Carlsberg Æresbolig, a mansion donated by [[Carl Jacobsen]], the heir to Carlsberg breweries, to be used as an honorary residence by the Dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science, literature or the arts.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=322–333}}

Bohr went to high school at {{Interlanguage link multi|Sortedam Gymnasium|da}} in Copenhagen. In 1940, shortly after the German occupation of Denmark in April, he entered the University of Copenhagen, where he studied physics. He assisted his father, helping draft correspondence and articles related to [[epistemology]] and physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biographical&quot; /&gt; In September 1943, word reached his family that the Nazis considered them to be Jewish, because Aage's grandmother, Ellen Adler Bohr, had been Jewish, and that they therefore were in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped the family [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|escape by sea]] to Sweden.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=483–484}} Bohr arrived there in October 1943, and then flew to Britain on a [[de Havilland Mosquito]] operated by [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]]. The Mosquitoes were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's [[bomb bay]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=280}}

On arrival in London, Bohr rejoined his father, who had flown to Britain the week before.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=280}} He officially became a junior researcher at the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]],  but actually served as personal assistant and secretary to his father. The two worked on [[Tube Alloys]], the British [[atomic bomb]] project. On 30 December 1943, they made the first of a number of visits to the United States, where his father was a consultant to the [[Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=248–249}} Due to his father's fame, they were given false names; Bohr became James Baker, and his father, Nicholas Baker.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=95}} In 1945, the director of the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], [[Robert Oppenheimer]], asked them to review the design of the [[modulated neutron initiator]]. They reported that it would work. That they had reached this conclusion put [[Enrico Fermi]]'s concerns about the viability of the design to rest.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=95}} The initiators performed flawlessly in the bombs used in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in August 1945.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=264–265, 308–309, 390–397}}

== Career ==
In August 1945, with the war ended, Bohr returned to Denmark, where he resumed his university education, graduating with a master's degree in 1946, with a thesis concerned with some aspects of [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|atomic stopping power]] problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biographical&quot; /&gt; In early 1948, Bohr became a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Institute for Advanced Study&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/abohr01 |title=Bohr, Aage Niels |publisher=[[Institute for Advanced Study]] |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While paying a visit to [[Columbia University]], he met [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]], who sparked an interest in recent discoveries related to the [[hyperfine structure]] of [[deuterium]]. This led to Bohr becoming a visiting fellow at Columbia from January 1949 to August 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biographical&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot; /&gt; While in the United States, Bohr married Marietta Soffer on 11 March 1950. They had three children: Vilhelm, Tomas and Margrethe.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/world/europe/11bohr.html |title=Aage Bohr, Physicist’s Son Who Won Nobel, Dies at 87 |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=10 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marietta&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geni.com/people/Marietta-Bohr/6000000009135398187 |title=Marietta Bohr (Soffer) (1922–1978) |publisher=Geni.com |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1940s it was known that the properties of [[atomic nuclei]] could not be explained by the then-current models such as the [[Semi-empirical mass formula#The liquid drop model and its analysis|liquid drop model]] developed by Niels Bohr amongst others.  The [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]], developed in 1949 by [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer]] and others, allowed some additional features to be explained, in particular the so-called [[Magic number (physics)|magic numbers]]. However, there were also properties that could not be explained, including the non-spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel lecture&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Rotational Motion in Nuclei Nobel Lecture, |date=11 December 1975 |first=Aage |last=Bohr |publisher=The Niels Bohr Institute and Nordita |location=Copenhagen |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/bohr-lecture.pdf |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1950 paper, [[James Rainwater]] of Columbia University suggested a variant of the drop model of the nucleus that could explain a non-spherical charge distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Nuclear Energy Level Argument for a Spheroidal Nuclear Model  |last=Rainwater |first=James |authorlink=James Rainwater |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume=79  |issue=3  |pages=432–434  |date=August 1950  |publisher=American Physical Society  |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.79.432|bibcode = 1950PhRv...79..432R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainwater's model postulated a nucleus like a balloon with balls inside that distort the surface as they move about. He discussed the idea with Bohr, who was visiting Columbia at the time, and had independently conceived the same idea, and had, about a month after Rainwater's submission, submitted for publication a paper that discussed the same problem, but along more general lines. Bohr imagined a rotating, irregular-shaped nucleus with a form of surface tension.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Scientist&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[New Scientist]] |issn=0262-4079 |volume=68 |issue=972 |date=23 October 1975 |title=Nobel Prizes 1975: Medicine, Chemistry and Physics … and fifty years ago |first=Roger |last=Lewin |first2=Martin |last2=Sherwood |first3=Robert |last3=Walgate }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr developed the idea further, in 1951 publishing a paper that comprehensively treated the relationship between oscillations of the surface of the nucleus and the movement of the individual [[nucleon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=On the Quantization of Angular Momenta in Heavy Nuclei  |last=Bohr |first=Aage  |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume=81  |issue=1  |pages=134–138  | date=January 1951 |publisher=American Physical Society  |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.81.134|bibcode = 1951PhRv...81..134B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Copenhagen in 1950, Bohr began working with [[Ben Mottelson]] to compare the theoretical work with experimental data. In three papers, that were published in 1952 and 1953, Bohr and Mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment; for example, showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab]] |title=Collective and Individual-Particle Aspects of Nuclear Structure  |volume=27 |issue=6 |year=1953 |last=Bohr |first=Aage |last2=Mottelson |first2=Ben R. |authorlink2=Ben Mottelson |url=http://www.sdu.dk/media/bibpdf/Bind%2020-29%5CBind%5Cmfm-27-16.pdf |accessdate=14 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Interpretation of Isomeric Transitions of Electric Quadrupole Type  |last=Bohr |first=Aage |last2=Mottelson |first2=Ben R. |authorlink2=Ben Mottelson  |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume=89  |issue=1  |pages=316–317  | date=January 1953 |publisher=American Physical Society  |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.89.316 |bibcode = 1953PhRv...89..316B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Rotational States in Even-Even Nuclei  |last=Bohr |first=Aage |last2=Mottelson |first2=Ben R. |authorlink2=Ben Mottelson  |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume=90  |issue=4  |pages=717–719  | date=May 1953 |publisher=American Physical Society  |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.90.717.2 |bibcode = 1953PhRv...90..717B }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were thereby able to reconcile the shell model with Rainwater's concept.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Scientist&quot; /&gt; This work stimulated many new theoretical and experimental studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel lecture&quot; /&gt; Bohr, Mottelson and Rainwater were jointly awarded the 1975 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] &quot;for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nobel Prize in Physics 1975&quot; /&gt; Because his father had been awarded the prize in 1922, Bohr became one of only four pairs of fathers and sons to win the Nobel Prize in Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/physics/ |title=Facts on the Nobel Prizes in Physics |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=12 May 2015 }} The others: [[William Henry Bragg]] (1915) and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] (1915); [[J. J. Thomson]] (1906) and [[George Paget Thomson]] (1937); and [[Manne Siegbahn]] (1924) and [[Kai M. Siegbahn]] (1981). Two pairs of fathers and sons have won Nobel Prizes in other fields: [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]] (chemistry, 1929) and [[Ulf von Euler]] (medicine, 1970); and [[Arthur Kornberg]] (medicine, 1969) and [[Roger D. Kornberg]] (chemistry, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; He married Marietta Soffer in 1950. They had two sons, Vilhelm and Tomas, and a daughter, Margrethe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Aage Bohr dies at 87; Danish physicist and Nobel Prize winner |first=Thomas H.

Only after doing his Nobel Prize-winning research did Bohr receive his doctorate from the University of Copenhagen, in 1954, writing his thesis on &quot;Rotational States of Atomic Nuclei&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1565671 |title=Rotational States of Atomic Nuclei |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |date=1954 |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr became a professor at the University of Copenhagen in 1956, and, following his father's death in 1962, succeeded him as director of the Niels Bohr Institute, a position he held until 1970. He remained active there until he retired in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobelprisvinderen Aage Bohr er død&quot; /&gt; He was also a member of the board of the [[Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics]] (Nordita) from its inception in 1957, and was its director from 1975 to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/namely_names/2009/nobel_prize_recipient_aage_bohr/ |title=Nobel Laureate Aage Bohr has died|publisher=[[Niels Bohr Institute]] |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Nobel Prize, he won the [[Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics]] in 1960, the [[Atoms for Peace Award]] in 1969, [[H.C. Ørsted Medal]] in 1970, [[Rutherford Medal and Prize]] in 1972, [[John Price Wetherill Medal]] in 1974, and the Ole Rømer medal in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;Institute for Advanced Study&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/academicians/deceased/bohr.html|first=Antonino|last=Zichichi |authorlink=Antonino Zichichi |title=Aage Bohr |publisher=[[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]]  |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iop.org/about/awards/subject/rutherford/medallists/page_38596.html |title=Rutherford medal recipients |publisher=[[Institute of Physics]] |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr and Mottelson continued to work together, publishing a two-volume [[monograph]], ''Nuclear Structure''. The first volume, ''Single-Particle Motion,'' appeared in 1969; the second, ''Nuclear Deformations,'' in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biographical&quot; /&gt;

In 1972 he was awarded an [[honorary degree]], doctor philos. honoris causa, at the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]], later part of [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=Honorary doctors at NTNU|publisher=Norwegian University of Science and Technology|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
