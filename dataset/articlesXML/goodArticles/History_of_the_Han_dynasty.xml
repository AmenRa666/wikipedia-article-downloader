{{chinesetext}}
The [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 220 CE), founded by the peasant rebel leader [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] (known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu),&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;From the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] to the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] dynasties, Chinese rulers were referred to in later records by their [[posthumous name]]s, while emperors of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] to [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasties were referred to by their [[temple name]]s, and emperors of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties were referred to by single [[Chinese era name|era names]] for their rule. See [[Endymion Wilkinson]]'s ''Chinese History'' (1998), p. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; was the second [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial dynasty of China]]. It followed the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BCE), which had unified the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] of [[China]] by conquest. Interrupted briefly by the [[Xin dynasty]] (9–23 CE) of [[Wang Mang]], the Han dynasty is divided into two periods: the Western Han (206 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 9 CE) and the Eastern Han (25–220 CE). These appellations are derived from the locations of the capital cities [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]], respectively. The third and final capital of the dynasty was [[Xuchang]], where the court moved in 196 CE during a period of political turmoil and [[civil war]].

The Han dynasty ruled in an era of Chinese [[Society and culture of the Han dynasty|cultural consolidation]], [[Government of the Han dynasty|political experimentation]], relative [[Economy of the Han dynasty|economic prosperity and maturity]], and great [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|technological advances]]. There was unprecedented territorial expansion and exploration initiated by struggles with non-Chinese peoples, especially the nomadic [[Xiongnu]] of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. [[List of emperors of the Han dynasty|The Han emperors]] were initially forced to acknowledge the rival Xiongnu [[Chanyu]]s as their equals, yet in reality the Han was an inferior partner in a [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary]] and royal marriage alliance known as [[heqin]]. This agreement was broken when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141–87 BCE) [[Han–Xiongnu War|launched a series of military campaigns]] which eventually caused the fissure of the Xiongnu Federation and redefined the borders of China. The Han realm was expanded into the [[Hexi Corridor]] of modern [[Gansu]] province, the [[Tarim Basin]] of modern [[Xinjiang]], modern [[Yunnan]] and [[Hainan]], modern [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern Vietnam]], modern [[North Korea]], and southern [[Outer Mongolia]]. The Han court established trade and tributary relations with rulers as far west as the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacids]], to whose court at [[Ctesiphon]] in [[Mesopotamia]] the Han monarchs sent envoys. [[Buddhism]] first entered China during the Han, spread by missionaries from [[Parthia]] and the [[Kushan Empire]] of [[North India|northern India]] and [[Central Asia]].

From its beginning, the Han imperial court was threatened by plots of treason and revolt from [[Kings of the Han dynasty|its subordinate kingdoms]], the latter eventually ruled only by royal [[Liu]] family members. Initially, the eastern half of the empire was indirectly administered through large semi-autonomous kingdoms which pledged loyalty and a portion of their tax revenues to the Han emperors, who ruled directly over the western half of the empire from Chang'an. Gradual measures were introduced by the imperial court to reduce the size and power of these kingdoms, until a reform of the middle 2nd century BCE abolished their semi-autonomous rule and staffed the kings' courts with central government officials. Yet much more volatile and consequential for the dynasty was the growing power of both [[consort clan]]s ([[:Category:Chinese empresses|of the empress]]) and the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] of [[Chinese Palaces|the palace]]. In 92 CE, the eunuchs entrenched themselves for the first time in the issue of the emperors' succession, [[Disasters of Partisan Prohibitions|causing a series of political crises]] which culminated in 189 CE with their downfall and slaughter in the palaces of Luoyang. This event triggered an age of civil war as the country became divided by regional warlords vying for power. Finally, in 220 CE, the son of an imperial chancellor and king accepted the abdication of the last Han emperor, who was deemed to have lost the [[Mandate of Heaven]] according to [[Dong Zhongshu]]'s (179–104 BCE) cosmological system that intertwined the fate of the imperial government with [[Tian|Heaven]] and the natural world. Following the Han, China was split into [[Three Kingdoms|three states]]: [[Cao Wei]], [[Shu Han]], and [[Eastern Wu]]; these were reconsolidated into one empire by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] (265–420 CE).

===Collapse of Qin===
The [[Zhou dynasty]] (c. 1050–256 BCE) had established the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] in [[Western China]] as an outpost to [[Horse breeding|breed horses]] and act as a defensive buffer against [[nomad]]ic armies of the [[Rong people|Rong]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], and [[Five Barbarians|Di]] peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 60&quot;/&gt; After conquering [[Seven Warring States|six Warring States]] (i.e. [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]], and [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi]]) by 221 BCE,&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 60&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 60.&lt;/ref&gt; the King of Qin, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], [[Qin's wars of unification|unified China under one empire]] divided into 36 centrally-controlled [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 61&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 61.&lt;/ref&gt; With control over much of [[China proper]], he affirmed his enhanced prestige by taking the unprecedented title [[Emperor of China|''huangdi'']] (皇帝), or 'emperor', known thereafter as Qin Shi Huang (i.e. the first emperor of Qin).&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 61&quot;/&gt; Han-era historians would accuse his regime of employing ruthless methods to preserve his rule.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen (2006), 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Group of soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Qin dynasty]] soldiers from the [[Terracotta Army]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]]'s mausoleum, located near [[Xi'an]]]]

Qin Shi Huang died of natural causes in 210 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 63&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In 209 BCE the [[conscription]] officers [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]], leading 900 conscripts through the rain, failed to meet an arrival deadline; the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories|Standard Histories]]'' claim that the Qin punishment for this delay would have been [[execution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 112 113&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid this, Chen and Wu started a rebellion against Qin, known as the [[Dazexiang Uprising]], but they were thwarted by the Qin general [[Zhang Han (Qin dynasty)|Zhang Han]] in 208 BCE; both Wu and Chen were subsequently assassinated by their own soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 112–113; ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷008|vol. 8]].&lt;/ref&gt; Yet by this point others had rebelled, among them [[Xiang Yu]] (d. 202 BCE) and his uncle [[Xiang Liang]] (項梁/项梁), men from a leading family of the [[Chu (state)|Chu]] aristocracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 113&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined by [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]], a man of peasant origin and supervisor of convicts in [[Pei County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 113&quot;/&gt; [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Mi Xin]], grandson of [[King Huai I of Chu]], was declared King Huai II of Chu at his powerbase of Pengcheng (modern [[Xuzhou]]) with the support of the Xiangs, while other kingdoms soon formed in opposition to Qin.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 114&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in 208 BCE Xiang Liang was killed in a battle with Zhang Han,&lt;ref name=ZZTJ8&gt;''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷008|vol. 8]].&lt;/ref&gt; who subsequently attacked Zhao Xie the King of Zhao at his capital of [[Handan]], forcing him to flee to [[Pingxiang County|Julu]], which Zhang [[Battle of Julu|put under siege]]. However, the new kingdoms of Chu, Yan, and Qi came to Zhao's aid; Xiang Yu defeated Zhang at Julu and in 207 BCE forced Zhang to surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 114&quot;/&gt;

While Xiang was occupied at Julu, King Huai II sent Liu Bang to capture the Qin heartland of [[Guanzhong]] with an agreement that the first officer to capture this region would become its king.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 114–115; Loewe (2000), 254.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 207 BCE, the Qin ruler [[Ziying]], who had claimed the reduced title of King of Qin, had his chief eunuch [[Zhao Gao]] killed after Zhao had orchestrated the deaths of Chancellor [[Li Si]] in 208 BCE and the second Qin emperor [[Qin Er Shi]] in 207 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 115&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu Bang gained Ziying's submission and secured the Qin capital of [[Xianyang]];&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 115&quot;/&gt; persuaded by his chief advisor [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] (d. 189 BCE) not to let his soldiers loot the city, he instead sealed up its treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 2000 255&quot;&gt;Loewe (2000), 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contention with Chu===
[[File:Western Han bronze wine warmer.jpg|thumb|right|A Western Han bronze [[Wine in China|wine warmer]] with cast and incised decoration, from [[Shanxi]] or [[Henan]] province, 1st century BCE]]
The ''Standard Histories'' allege that when Xiang Yu arrived at Xianyang two months later in early 206 BCE, he looted it, burned it to the ground, and had Ziying executed.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 115; Davis (2001), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Xiang Yu offered King Huai II the title of [[Emperor Yi of Chu]] and sent him to a remote frontier where he was assassinated; Xiang Yu then assumed the title Hegemon-King of Western Chu (西楚霸王) and became the leader of a confederacy of [[Eighteen Kingdoms|18 kingdoms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 116&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 116.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Feast at Hong Gate]], Xiang Yu considered having Liu Bang assassinated, but Liu, realizing that Xiang was considering killing him, escaped during the middle of the feast.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (2000), 255; Loewe (1986), 117; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷009|vol. 9]].&lt;/ref&gt; In a slight towards Liu Bang, Xiang Yu [[Three Qins|carved Guanzhong into three kingdoms]] with former Qin general Zhang Han and two of his subordinates as kings; Liu Bang was granted the frontier Kingdom of Han in [[Hanzhong]], where he would pose less of a political challenge to Xiang Yu.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (2001), 44; Loewe (1986), 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 206 BCE, Liu Bang heard of Emperor Yi's fate and decided to rally some of the new kingdoms to oppose Xiang Yu, leading to a four-year war known as the [[Chu–Han Contention|Chu–Han contention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;davis 2001 44 45&quot;&gt;Davis (2001), 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Liu initially made a direct assault against Pengcheng and captured it while Xiang was battling another king who resisted him—Tian Guang (田廣) the King of Qi—but his forces collapsed upon Xiang's return to Pengcheng; he was saved by a storm which delayed the arrival of Chu's troops, although his father [[Liu Taigong|Liu Zhijia]] (劉執嘉) and wife [[Empress Lü Zhi|Lü Zhi]] were captured by Chu forces.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (2001), 44–45; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷009|vol. 9]].&lt;/ref&gt; Liu barely escaped another defeat at [[Xingyang]], but Xiang Yu was unable to pursue him because Liu Bang induced [[Ying Bu]] (英布), the King of Huainan, to rebel against Xiang.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis 2001&quot;&gt;Davis (2001), 45; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷009|vol. 9]].&lt;/ref&gt; After Liu Bang occupied [[Chenggao]] along with a large Qin grain storage, Xiang threatened to kill Liu's father if he did not surrender, but Liu did not give in to Xiang's threats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis 2001&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Agrafe Chine Guimet 29102.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Gilding|gilded]] [[Belt buckle|belt clasp]] with [[turquoise]], dated [[Warring States period]] to early [[Han dynasty]], 4th to 3rd centuries BCE]]
With Chenggao and his food supplies lost, and with Liu Bang's general [[Han Xin]] (d. 196 BCE) having conquered Zhao and Qin to Chu's north,&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷009|vol. 9]].&lt;/ref&gt; in 203 BCE Xiang Yu offered to release Liu Bang's relatives from captivity and split China into political halves: the west would belong to Han and the east to Chu.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis 2001 45&quot;&gt;Davis (2001), 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Liu accepted the truce, it was short-lived, and in 202 BCE [[Battle of Gaixia|at Gaixia]] in modern [[Anhui]], the Han forces forced Xiang Yu to flee from his fortified camp in the early morning with only 800 cavalry, pursued by 5,000 Han cavalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis 2001 45 46&quot;&gt;Davis (2001), 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; After several bouts of fighting, Xiang Yu became surrounded at the banks of the [[Yangzi River]], where he committed suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis 2001 46&quot;&gt;Davis (2001), 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu Bang took the title of emperor, and is known to posterity as [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] (r. 202–195 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;davis 2001 46&quot;/&gt;

==Reign of Gaozu==

===Consolidation, precedents, and rivals===
{{further information|Government of the Han dynasty|Society and culture of the Han dynasty}}
Emperor Gaozu initially made [[Luoyang]] his capital, but then moved it to [[Chang'an]] (near modern [[Xi'an]], [[Shaanxi]]) due to concerns over natural defences and better access to supply routes.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 122&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Qin precedent, Emperor Gaozu adopted the administrative model of a tripartite cabinet (formed by the [[Three Excellencies]]) along with nine subordinate ministries (headed by the [[Nine Ministers]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 120&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Han statesmen's general condemnation of Qin's harsh methods and [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalist philosophy]], the first Han [[Code (law)|law code]] compiled by Chancellor [[Xiao He]] in 200 BCE seems to have borrowed much from the structure and substance of the Qin code (excavated texts from [[Shuihudi Qin bamboo texts|Shuihudi]] and [[Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts|Zhangjiashan]] in modern times have reinforced this suspicion).&lt;ref&gt;Hulsewé (1986), 526; Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 23–24; Hansen (2000), 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Han jade burial suit.JPG|thumb|left|Beginning in the Han period, [[Kings of the Han dynasty|kings]] were interred in [[jade burial suit]] made of small [[Chinese jade|pieces of jade]] sewn together with golden thread.&lt;ref&gt;Tom (1989), 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shi (2003), 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt; (金縷玉衣)]]
From Chang'an, Gaozu ruled directly over 13 commanderies (increased to 16 by his death) in the western portion of the empire. In the eastern portion, he established [[Kings of the Han dynasty|10 semi-autonomous kingdoms]] (Yan, Dai, Zhao, Qi, Liang, Chu, Huai, Wu, Nan, and Changsha) that he bestowed to his most prominent followers to placate them. Due to alleged acts of rebellion and even alliances with the [[Xiongnu]]—a northern nomadic people—by 196 BCE Gaozu had replaced nine of them with members of the royal family.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 122 128&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 122–128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hinsch 2002 20&quot;&gt;Hinsch (2002), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Michael Loewe]], the administration of each kingdom was &quot;a small-scale replica of the central government, [[Chancellor of China|with its chancellor]], royal counsellor, and other functionaries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 126&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdoms were to transmit [[census]] information and a portion of their [[Tax system in China|taxes]] to the central government. Although they were responsible for maintaining an armed force, kings were not authorized to mobilize troops without explicit permission from the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 126&quot;/&gt;

Wu Rui (吳芮), King of Changsha, was the only remaining king not of the Liu clan. When Wu Rui's great-grandson Wu Zhu (吳著) or Wu Chan (吳產) died heirless in 157 BCE, Changsha was transformed into an imperial commandery and later a Liu family principality.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 122–128; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷015|vol. 15]]; ''[[Book of Han]]'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a02/013.htm vol. 13].&lt;/ref&gt; South of Changsha, Gaozu sent Lu Jia (陸賈) as ambassador to the court of [[Zhao Tuo]] to acknowledge the latter's sovereignty over [[Nanyue]] ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: [[Triệu Dynasty]]; in modern [[Southwest China]] and [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern Vietnam]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 127 128&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xiongnu and Heqin===
[[File:Iron ji and knife, Han Dynasty.JPG|thumb|right|[[Chicken Sickles|An iron chicken sickle]] and an [[Chinese swords|iron dagger]] from the Han dynasty]]
The Qin general [[Meng Tian]] had forced [[Toumen]], the ''[[Chanyu]]'' of the Xiongnu, out of the [[Ordos Desert]] in 215 BCE, but Toumen's son and successor [[Modu Chanyu]] built the Xiongnu into a powerful empire by subjugating many other tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 174–176; Torday (1997), 71–73.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Modu's death in 174 BCE, the Xiongnu domains stretched from what is now [[northeast China]] and [[Mongolia]] to the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;di cosmo 175 189&quot;&gt;Di Cosmo (2001), 175–189.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese feared incursions by the Xiongnu under the guise of trade and were concerned that Han-manufactured iron weapons would fall into Xiongnu hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;torday 1997 75 77&quot;&gt;Torday (1997), 75–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaozu thus enacted a trade [[embargo]] against the Xiongnu. To compensate the Chinese border merchants of the northern kingdoms of Dai and Yan for lost trade, he made them government officials with handsome salaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;torday 1997 75 77&quot;/&gt; Outraged by this embargo, Modu Chanyu planned to attack Han. When the Xiongnu invaded [[Taiyuan]] in 200 BCE and were aided by the defector [[King Xin of Hán]] (韓/韩, not to be confused with the ruling Hàn 漢 dynasty, or the general [[Han Xin]]), Gaozu personally led his forces through the snow to Pingcheng (near modern [[Datong]], [[Shanxi]]).&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 190–192; Torday (1997), 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing [[Battle of Baideng]], Gaozu's forces were heavily surrounded for seven days; running short of supplies, he was forced to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 192; Torday (1997), 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

After this defeat, the court adviser Liu Jing (劉敬, originally named Lou Jing [婁敬]) convinced the emperor to create a peace treaty and marriage alliance with the Xiongnu Chanyu called the ''[[heqin]]'' agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 192–193; Yü (1967), 9–10; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 52&lt;/ref&gt; By this arrangement established in 198 BCE, the Han hoped to modify the Xiongnu's nomadic values with Han luxury goods given as [[tribute]] ([[silk]]s, [[Wine in China|wine]], [[Chinese cuisine|foodstuffs]], etc.) and to make Modu's half-Chinese successor a subordinate to grandfather Gaozu.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 193; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact amounts of annual tribute as promised by Emperor Gaozu given to the Xiongnu in the 2nd century BCE shortly after the defeat are unknown. In 89 BCE, however, Hulugu Chanyu (狐鹿姑) (r. 95–85 BCE) requested a renewal of the heqin agreement with the increased amount of annual tribute at 400,000 L (11,350 U.S. bu) of wine, 100,000 L (2,840 U.S. bu) of grain, and 10,000 bales of silk; thus previous amounts would have been less than these figures.&lt;ref&gt;Yu (1986) 397; ''[[Book of Han]]'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a02/094a.htm vol. 94a].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empress Dowager Lü's rule==
{{main article|Lü Clan Disturbance}}

===Emperor Hui===

When Ying Bu rebelled in 195 BCE, Emperor Gaozu personally led the troops against Ying and received an arrow wound which allegedly led to his death the following year. His [[heir apparent]] Liu Ying took the throne and is posthumously known as [[Emperor Hui of Han]] (r. 195–188 BCE). Shortly afterwards Gaozu's widow [[Empress Lü Zhi|Lü Zhi]], now [[empress dowager]], had [[Liu Ruyi]], a potential claimant to the throne, poisoned and his mother, the [[Consort Qi]], brutally mutilated. When the teenage Emperor Hui discovered the cruel acts committed by his mother, Loewe says that he &quot;did not dare disobey her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 130&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hui's brief reign saw the completion of the [[Chinese city wall|defensive city walls]] around the capital Chang'an in 190 BCE; these [[brick]] and [[rammed earth]] walls were originally 12&amp;nbsp;m (40&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and formed a rough rectangular ground plan (with some irregularities due to topography); their ruins still stand today.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 130–131; Wang (1982), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This urban construction project was completed by 150,000 [[conscription|conscript laborers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 130 131&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Hui's reign saw the repeal of old Qin laws banning certain types of literature and was characterized by a cautious approach to foreign policy, including the renewal of the ''heqin'' agreement with the Xiongnu and Han's acknowledgment of the independent sovereignty of the Kings of Donghai and Nanyue.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 135&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regency and downfall of the Lü clan===
[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 069.jpg|thumb|Terracotta figurine of a female servant, Western Han Era]]

Since Emperor Hui did not sire any children with his empress [[Empress Zhang Yan|Zhang Yan]], after his death in 188 BCE, Lü Zhi, now [[grand empress dowager]] and [[regent]], chose his successor from among his sons with other consorts.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 135&quot;/&gt; She first placed [[Liu Gong|Emperor Qianshao of Han]] (r. 188–184 BCE) on the throne, but then removed him for [[Puppet monarch|another puppet]] ruler [[Emperor Houshao of Han]] (r. 184–180 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 135; Hansen (2000), 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; She not only issued imperial edicts during their reigns, but she also appointed members [[Consort clan|of her own clan]] as kings against Emperor Gaozu's explicit prohibition;&lt;ref name=ZZTJ13&gt;''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷013|vol. 13]].&lt;/ref&gt; other clan members became key military officers and civil officials.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 135–136; Hinsch (2002), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court under Lü Zhi was not only unable to deal with a Xiongnu invasion of Longxi Commandery (in modern [[Gansu]]) in which 2,000 Han prisoners were taken, but it also provoked a conflict with [[Zhao Tuo]], King of Nanyue, by imposing a ban on exporting iron and other trade items to his southern kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 136&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Proclaiming himself Emperor Wu of Nanyue (南越武帝) in 183 BCE, Zhao Tuo attacked the Han Kingdom of Changsha in 181 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 136&quot;/&gt; He did not rescind his rival imperial title until the Han ambassador Lu Jia again visited Nanyue's court during the reign of Emperor Wen.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Empress Dowager Lü's death in 180 BCE, it was alleged that the Lü clan plotted to overthrow the Liu dynasty,&lt;ref name=&quot;torday 1997 78&quot;&gt;Torday (1997), 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liu Xiang, Prince of Qi|Liu Xiang]] the King of Qi (Emperor Gaozu's grandson) rose against the Lüs.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 136; ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷013|vol. 13]].&lt;/ref&gt; Before the central government and Qi forces engaged each other, the Lü clan was ousted from power and destroyed by a coup led by the officials [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]] and Zhou Bo (周勃) at Chang'an.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 136; Torday (1997), 78; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 51–52; ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷013|vol. 13]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although Liu Xiang had resisted the Lüs, he was passed over to become emperor because he had mobilized troops without permission from the central government and because his mother 's family possessed the same ambitious attitude as the Lüs.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 136 137&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empress Dowager Bo|Consort Bo]], the mother of Liu Heng, King of Dai, was considered to possess a noble character, so her son was chosen as successor to the throne; he is known posthumously as [[Emperor Wen of Han]] (r. 180–157 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 136 137&quot;/&gt;

===Reforms and policies===
{{further information|Government of the Han dynasty|Society and culture of the Han dynasty}}
During the &quot;Rule of Wen and Jing&quot; (the era named after Emperor Wen and his successor [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] (r. 157–141 BCE), the Han Empire witnessed greater economic and dynastic stability, while the central government assumed more power over the realm.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 137 138&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to distance itself from the harsh rule of Qin, the court under these rulers abolished legal punishments involving mutilation in 167 BCE, declared eight widespread [[Amnesty|amnesties]] between 180–141 BCE, and reduced the tax rate on households' [[Agriculture in China|agricultural produce]] from [[Economy of the Han dynasty|one-fifteenth to one-thirtieth]] in 168 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 149 150&quot;/&gt; It was abolished altogether the following year, but reinstated at the rate of one-thirtieth in 156 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 149 150&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Government policies were influenced by the proto-[[Taoism|Daoist]] [[Huang-Lao]] (黃老) ideology, a mix of political and cosmological precepts given patronage by Wen's wife [[Empress Dou (Wen)|Empress Dou]] (d. 135 BCE), who was empress dowager during Jing's reign and grand empress dowager during the early reign of his successor [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] (r. 141–87 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 137–138; Loewe (1994), 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Huang-Lao, named after the mythical [[Yellow Emperor]] and the 6th-century-BCE philosopher [[Laozi]], viewed the former as the founder of ordered civilization; this was unlike the Confucians, who gave that role to legendary sage kings [[Yao (ruler)|Yao]] and [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1994 128 129&quot;&gt;Loewe (1994), 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Han imperial patrons of Huang-Lao sponsored the policy of &quot;nonaction&quot; or [[Wu wei|wuwei]] (無為) (a central concept of Laozi's ''[[Tao Te Ching|Daodejing]]''), which claimed that rulers should interfere as little as possible if administrative and legal systems were to function smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Huang-Lao doctrines on state affairs became eclipsed with the formal adoption of [[Confucianism]] as state ideology during Wu's reign and the later view that Laozi, not the Yellow Emperor, was the originator of Daoist practices.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (2000), 124–126; Loewe (1994), 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;

From 179–143 BCE, the number of kingdoms was increased from eleven to twenty-five and the number of commanderies from nineteen to forty.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 139&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 139.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not due to a large territorial expansion, but because kingdoms that had rebelled against Han rule or failed to produce an heir were significantly reduced in size or even abolished and carved into new commanderies or smaller kingdoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 140 144&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 140–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebellion of Seven States===
[[File:Met, Earthenware figures playing liubo, Han Dynasty.JPG|thumb|Seated [[earthenware]] figures playing on a model ''[[liubo]]'' [[board game]], dated to the Eastern Han Era]]
When Liu Xian (劉賢), the heir apparent of Wu, once made an official visit to the capital during Wen's reign, he played a [[board game]] called ''[[liubo]]'' with then [[crown prince]] Liu Qi, the future [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 141&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; During a heated dispute, Liu Qi threw the game board at Liu Xian, killing him.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ16&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷016|vol. 16]].&lt;/ref&gt; This outraged his father Liu Pi (劉濞), the King of Wu and a nephew of Emperor Gaozu's, who was nonetheless obliged to claim allegiance to Liu Qi once he took the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 141&quot;/&gt;

Still bitter over the death of his son and fearful that he would be targeted in a wave of reduction of kingdom sizes that Emperor Jing carried out under the advice of [[Government of the Han dynasty#Imperial Counselor|Imperial Counselor]] [[Chao Cuo]] (d. 154 BCE), the King of Wu led a revolt against Han in 154 BCE as the head of a coalition with six other rebelling kingdoms: Chu, Zhao, Jiaoxi, Jiaodong, Zaichuan, and Jinan, which also feared such reductions.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 141 ZZTJ16&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 141; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷016|vol. 16]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Han forces commanded by [[Zhou Yafu]] were ready and able to put down the revolt, destroying the coalition of seven states against Han.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 141 ZZTJ16&quot;/&gt; Several kingdoms were abolished (although later reinstated) and others significantly reduced in size.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 141 142&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Jing issued an edict in 145 BCE which outlawed the independent administrative staffs in the kingdoms and abolished all their senior offices except for the chancellor, who was henceforth reduced in status and appointed directly by the central government.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 144&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 144.&lt;/ref&gt; His successor Emperor Wu would diminish their power even further by abolishing the kingdoms' tradition of [[primogeniture]] and ordering that each king had to divide up his realm between all of his male heirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 64&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with the Xiongnu===

In 177 BCE, the Xiongnu [[Tuqi|Wise King of the Right]] raided the non-Chinese tribes living under Han protection in the northwest (modern [[Gansu]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;torday 1997 80 81&quot;&gt;Torday (1997), 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; In 176 BCE, Modu Chanyu sent a letter to Emperor Wen informing him that the Wise King, allegedly insulted by Han officials, acted without the Chanyu's permission and so he punished the Wise King by forcing him to conduct a military campaign against the nomadic [[Yuezhi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;torday 1997 80 81&quot;/&gt; Yet this event was merely part of a larger effort to recruit nomadic tribes north of Han China, during which the bulk of the Yuezhi were expelled from the [[Hexi Corridor]] (fleeing west into Central Asia) and the sedentary state of [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]] in the [[Lop Nur]] salt marsh, the nomadic [[Wusun]] of the [[Tian Shan]] range, and twenty-six other states east of [[Samarkand]] ([[Sogdia]]) were subjugated to Xiongnu hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Torday (1997), 80–81; Yü (1986), 387–388; Di Cosmo (2002), 196–198.&lt;/ref&gt; Modu Chanyu's implied threat that he would invade China if the ''heqin'' agreement was not renewed sparked a debate in Chang'an; although officials such as Chao Cuo and [[Jia Yi]] (d. 169 BCE) wanted to reject the heqin policy, Emperor Wen favored renewal of the agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;di cosmo 2002 201 203&quot;&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 201–203.&lt;/ref&gt; Modu Chanyu died before the Han tribute reached him, but his successor [[Laoshang Chanyu]] (174–160 BCE) renewed the heqin agreement and negotiated the opening of border markets.&lt;ref&gt;Torday (1997), 82–83; Yü (1986), 388–389.&lt;/ref&gt; Lifting the ban on trade significantly reduced the frequency and size of Xiongnu raids, which had necessitated tens of thousands of Han troops to be stationed at the border.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 199–201 &amp; 204–205; Torday (1997), 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Laoshang Chanyu and his successor [[Junchen Chanyu]] (車臣) (r. 160–126 BCE) continued to violate Han's territorial sovereignty by making incursions despite the treaty.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 388 389&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 388–389.&lt;/ref&gt; While Laoshang Chanyu continued the conquest of his father by driving the Yuezhi into the [[Ili River]] valley, the Han quietly built up its strength in cavalry forces to later challenge the Xiongnu.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 388–389; Di Cosmo (2002), 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Emperor Gaozu did not ascribe to the philosophy and system of [[ethics]] attributed to [[Confucius]] (fl. 6th century BCE), he did enlist the aid of Confucians such as Lu Jia and [[Shusun Tong]] (叔孫通); in 196 BCE he established the first Han regulation for [[Xiaolian|recruiting men of merit]] into [[Civil service|government service]], which Robert P. Kramer calls the &quot;first major impulse toward the famous [[Imperial examinations|examination system]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kramers 1986 752 753&quot;&gt;Kramers (1986), 752–753.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperors Wen and Jing appointed Confucian academicians to court, yet not all academicians at their courts specialized in what would later become orthodox Confucian texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;kramers 1986 752 753&quot;/&gt; For several years after [[Emperor Wu of Han|Liu Che]] took the throne in 141 BCE (known posthumously as Emperor Wu), the Grand Empress Dowager Dou continued to dominate the court and did not accept any policy which she found unfavorable or contradicted Huang-Lao ideology.&lt;ref name=&quot;kramers 1986 752 753&quot;/&gt; After her death in 135 BCE, a major shift occurred in Chinese political history.
[[File:Western Han gilt bronze lamp2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A 2nd century BCE Western Han [[Gilding|gilded]] bronze [[oil lamp]] set with painted [[silver]] designs]]
After [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] called for the submission of [[memorial to the throne|memorial essays]] on how to improve the government, he favored that of the official [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179–104 BCE), a philosopher whom Kramers calls the first Confucian &quot;[[Theology|theologian]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kramer 1986 754 755&quot;&gt;Kramer (1986), 754–755.&lt;/ref&gt; Dong's synthesis fused together the ethical ideas of Confucius with the [[Cosmology|cosmological]] beliefs in [[yin and yang]] and [[Wu Xing|Five Elements or Wuxing]] by fitting them into the same holistic, universal system which governed heaven, earth, and the world of man.&lt;ref name=&quot;kramers 753 754&quot;&gt;Kramers (1986), 753–754.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it justified the imperial system of government by providing it its place within the greater cosmos.&lt;ref name=&quot;kramers 1986 754&quot;&gt;Kramers (1986), 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the ideas of Dong Zhongshu, Emperor Wu issued an edict in 136 BCE that abolished academic chairs other than those focused on the Confucian [[Five Classics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kramers 1986 754 756&quot;&gt;Kramers (1986), 754–756.&lt;/ref&gt; In 124 BCE Emperor Wu established [[Taixue|the Imperial University]], at which the academicians taught 50 students; this was the incipient beginning of the civil service examination system refined in later dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Kramers (1986), 754–756; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Although sons and relatives of officials were often privileged with nominations to office, those who did not come from a family of officials were not barred from entry into the bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 77&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, education in the Five Classics became the paramount prerequisite for gaining office; as a result, the Imperial University was expanded dramatically by the 2nd century CE when it accommodated 30,000 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 77 78&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Cai Lun]]'s (d. 121 CE) invention of the [[papermaking]] process in 105 CE,&lt;ref name=&quot;tom 1989 99&quot;&gt;Tom (1989), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; the spread of [[paper]] as a cheap writing medium from the Eastern Han period onwards increased the supply [[Traditional Chinese bookbinding|of books]] and hence the number of those who could be educated for civil service.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 80&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War against the Xiongnu===
{{main article|Han–Xiongnu War}}
[[File:Bronze horse with lead saddle, Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|right|A Western or Eastern Han bronze horse with a lead saddle]]

The death of Empress Dou also marked a significant shift in foreign policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;torday 1997 91&quot;&gt;Torday (1997), 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address the Xiongnu threat and renewal of the ''heqin'' agreement, Emperor Wu called a court conference into session in 135 BCE where two factions of leading ministers debated the merits and faults of the current policy; Emperor Wu followed the [[Consensus decision-making|majority consensus of his ministers]] that peace should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Torday (1997), 83–84; Yü (1986), 389–390.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, while the Xiongnu were busy raiding the northern border and waiting for Han's response, Wu had another court conference assembled. The faction supporting war against the Xiongnu was able to sway the majority opinion by making a compromise for those worried about stretching financial resources on an indefinite campaign: [[Battle of Mayi|in a limited engagement along the border near Mayi]], Han forces would lure Junchen Chanyu over with gifts and promises of defections in order to quickly eliminate him and cause political chaos for the Xiongnu.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 211–214; Yü (1986) 389–390.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Mayi trap failed in 133 BCE (Junchen Chanyu realized he was about to fall into a trap and fled back north), the era of ''heqin''-style appeasement was broken and the Han court resolved to engage in full-scale war.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986) 389–390; Di Cosmo (2002), 214; Torday (1997), 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading campaigns involving tens of thousands of troops, in 127 BCE the Han general [[Wei Qing]] (d. 106 BCE) recaptured the [[Ordos Desert]] region from the Xiongnu and in 121 BCE [[Huo Qubing]] (d. 117 BCE) expelled them from the [[Qilian Mountains]], gaining the surrender of many Xiongnu aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 390; Di Cosmo (2002), 237–239.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Mobei]] in 119 BCE, generals Wei and Huo led the campaign to the [[Khangai Mountains]] where they forced the chanyu to flee north of the [[Gobi Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 390; Di Cosmo (2002), 240.&lt;/ref&gt; The maintenance of 300,000 horses by government slaves in thirty-six different pasture lands was not enough to satisfy the cavalry and baggage trains needed for these campaigns, so the government offered exemption from military and corvée labor for up to three male members of each household who presented a [[Horse breeding|privately bred horse]] to the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;di cosmo 2002 232&quot;&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Xiongnu's King Hunye surrendered to Huo Qubing in 121 BCE, the Han acquired a territory stretching from the [[Hexi Corridor]] to [[Lop Nur]], thus cutting the Xiongnu off from their [[Qiang people|Qiang]] allies.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 391; Di Cosmo (2002), 241–242; Chang (2007), 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; New commanderies were established in the Ordos as well as four in the Hexi Corridor—[[Jiuquan]], [[Zhangyi]], [[Dunhuang]], and [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]]—which were populated with Han settlers after a major Qiang-Xiongnu allied force was repelled from the region in 111 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 391; Chang (2007), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; By 119 BCE, Han forces established their first garrison outposts in the [[Juyan Lake Basin]] of [[Inner Mongolia]], with larger settlements built there after 110 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2007), 23–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 40% of the settlers at Juyan came from the Guandong region of modern [[Henan]], western [[Shandong]], southern [[Shanxi]], southern [[Hebei]], northwestern [[Jiangsu]], and northwestern [[Anhui]].&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2007), 53–56.&lt;/ref&gt; After Hunye's surrender, the Han court moved 725,000 people from the Guandong region to populate the Xinqinzhong (新秦中) region south of the bend of the Yellow River.&lt;ref name=&quot;chang 2007 6&quot;&gt;Chang (2007), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In all, Emperor Wu's forces conquered roughly 4.4 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1.7 million mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of new land, by far the largest territorial expansion in Chinese history.&lt;ref name=&quot;chang 2007 173&quot;&gt;Chang (2007), 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-sustaining [[Tuntian|agricultural garrisons]] were established in these frontier outposts to support military campaigns as well as secure trade routes leading into Central Asia, the eastern terminus of the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 241–244, 249–250.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han-era Great Wall was extended as far west as Dunhuang and sections of it still stand today in Gansu, including thirty Han [[beacon]] towers and two fortified castles.&lt;ref name=&quot;morton lewis 2005 56&quot;&gt;Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 139 BCE, the Han diplomat [[Zhang Qian]] traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da Yuezhi (who were evicted from Gansu by the Xiongnu in 177 BCE); however, Zhang's travels revealed entire countries which the Chinese were unaware of, the [[Hellenistic civilization|remnants of the conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] (r. 336–323 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 247–249; Yü (1986), 407; Torday (1997), 104; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; When Zhang returned to China in 125 BCE, he reported on his visits to [[Dayuan]] ([[Fergana]]), [[Kangju]] ([[Sogdiana]]), and [[Daxia]] ([[Bactria]], formerly the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] which was subjugated by the Da Yuezhi).&lt;ref&gt;Torday (1997), 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang described Dayuan and Daxia as agricultural and urban countries like China, and although he did not venture there, described Shendu (the [[Indus River]] valley of [[northern India]]) and Anxi ([[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] territories) further west.&lt;ref name=&quot;torday 1997 108 112&quot;&gt;Torday (1997), 108–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Envoys sent to these states returned with foreign delegations and lucrative trade caravans;&lt;ref&gt;Torday (1997), 114–117.&lt;/ref&gt; yet even before this, Zhang noted that these countries were importing Chinese [[silk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 69&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; After interrogating merchants, Zhang also discovered a southwestern trade route leading through [[Burma]] and on to [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;torday 1997 112 113&quot;&gt;Torday (1997), 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known [[Roman glass]]ware found in China (but manufactured in the [[Roman Empire]]) is a glass bowl found in a [[Guangzhou]] tomb dating to the early 1st century BCE and perhaps came from a maritime route passing through the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;an 2002 83&quot;&gt;An (2002), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, imported Chinese silk attire became popular in the Roman Empire by the time of [[Julius Caesar]] (100–44 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 70&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''heqin'' agreement broke down, the Xiongnu were forced to extract more crafts and agricultural foodstuffs from the subjugated Tarim Basin urban centers.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt; From 115–60 BCE the Han and Xiongnu battled for control and influence over these states,&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 390 391&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 390–391.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Han gaining, from 108–101 BCE [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary submission]] of Loulan, [[Turpan]], [[Luntai County|Bügür]], Dayuan (Fergana), and Kangju (Sogdiana).&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2007), 174; Yü (1986), 409–411.&lt;/ref&gt; The farthest-reaching and most expensive invasion was [[War of the Heavenly Horses|Li Guangli's four-year campaign]] against [[Fergana Valley|Fergana]] in the [[Syr Darya]] and [[Amu Darya]] valleys (modern [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 409 411&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 409–411.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Laszlo Torday (1997) asserts that Fergana threatened to cut off Han's access to the Silk Road, yet historian [[Sima Qian]] (d. 86 BCE) downplayed this threat by asserting that Li's mission was really a means to punish Dayuan for not providing tribute of [[Ferghana horse|prized Central Asian stallions]].&lt;ref&gt;Torday (1997), 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south, Emperor Wu assisted King [[Zhao Mo]] in [[Han campaigns against Minyue|fending off an attack]] by [[Minyue]] (in modern [[Fujian]]) in 135 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 452.&lt;/ref&gt; After a pro-Han faction was overthrown at the court of Nanyue, Han naval forces conquered Nanyue in 111 BCE during the [[Han–Nanyue War]], bringing areas of modern [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Hainan Island]], and northern [[Vietnam]] under Han control.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986) 451–453.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Wu also [[Han campaign against Dian|launched an invasion]] into the [[Dian Kingdom]] of [[Yunnan]] in 109 BCE, subjugating its king as a tributary vassal, while later Dian rebellions in 86 BCE and 83 BCE, 14 CE (during Wang Mang's rule), and 42–45 CE were quelled by Han forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 83&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu sent an expedition into what is now [[North Korea]] in 128 BCE, but this was abandoned two years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 448&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 448.&lt;/ref&gt; In 108 BCE, another expedition established four commanderies there, only two of which (i.e. [[Xuantu Commandery]] and [[Lelang Commandery]]) remained after 82 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 448–449.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was some violent resistance in 108 BCE and irregular raids by [[Goguryeo]] and [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]] afterwards, Chinese settlers conducted peaceful trade relations with native Koreans who lived largely independent of (but were culturally influenced by) the sparse Han settlements.&lt;ref name=&quot;pai 1992 310 315&quot;&gt;Pai (1992), 310–315.&lt;/ref&gt;

To fund his prolonged military campaigns and colonization efforts, Emperor Wu turned away from the &quot;nonaction&quot; policy of earlier reigns by having the central government [[Nationalization|commandeer the private industries and trades]] of [[Salt mine|salt mining]] and [[History of ferrous metallurgy|iron manufacturing]] by 117 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsch (2002), 21–22; Wagner (2001), 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Another government monopoly over [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|liquor]] was established in 98 BCE, but the majority consensus at a court conference in 81 BCE led to the breaking up of this monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (2001), 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematician and official [[Sang Hongyang]] (d. 80 BCE), who later became Imperial Counselor and one of many former merchants drafted into the government to help administer these monopolies, was responsible for the 'equable transportation' system that eliminated [[price dispersion|price variation]] over time from place to place.&lt;ref name=&quot;wagner 2001 13&quot;&gt;Wagner (2001), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a government means to interfere in the profitable grain trade by eliminating [[speculation]] (since the government stocked up on grain when cheap and sold it to the public at a low price when private merchants demanded higher ones).&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey (1999), 75; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; This along with the monopolies were criticized even during Wu's reign as bringing unnecessary hardships for merchants' profits and farmers forced to rely on poor-quality government-made goods and services; the monopolies and equable transportation did not last into the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (2001), 13–17; Nishijima (1986), 576.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Emperor Wu's reign, the [[Tax per head|poll tax]] for each minor aged three to fourteen was raised from 20 to 23 coins; the rate for adults remained at 120.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 160 161&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt; New taxes exacted on market transactions, wheeled vehicles, and properties were meant to bolster the growing military budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 160 161&quot;/&gt; In 119 BCE [[Ancient Chinese coinage|a new bronze coin]] weighing five ''shu'' (3.2 g/0.11 oz)—replacing the four ''shu'' coin—was issued by the government (remaining the standard coin of China until the [[Tang dynasty]]), followed by a ban on [[Mint (coin)|private minting]] in 113 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 160–161; Nishijima (1986), 581–582.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier attempts to ban private minting took place in 186 and 144 BCE, but Wu's monopoly over the issue of coinage remained in place throughout the Han (although its stewardship changed hands between different government agencies).&lt;ref&gt;Nishijima (1986), 586–588.&lt;/ref&gt; From 118 BCE to 5 CE, the Han government minted 28 billion coins, an average of 220 million a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;nishijima 1986 588&quot;&gt;Nishijima (1986), 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regency of Huo Guang===

Emperor Wu's first wife, [[Empress Chen Jiao]], was deposed in 130 BCE after allegations that she attempted [[witchcraft]] to help her produce a male heir.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; In 91 BCE, similar allegations were made against Emperor Wu's [[Crown Prince]] [[Liu Ju]], the son of Emperor Wu's second wife [[Empress Wei Zifu]]. Prince Liu Ju, in fear of Emperor Wu's believing the false allegations, began a rebellion in Chang'an which lasted for five days, while Emperor Wu was away at his quiet summer retreat of Ganquan (甘泉; in modern Shaanxi),.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 175–177; Loewe (2000), 275.&lt;/ref&gt; After Liu Ju's defeat, both he and Empress Wei committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷022|vol. 22]]; Loewe (2000), 275; Loewe (1986), 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, due to his good reputation, Huo Qubing's half-brother [[Huo Guang]] was entrusted by Wu to form a [[triumvirate]] regency alongside ethnically Xiongnu [[Jin Midi]] (d. 86 BCE) and [[Shangguan Jie]] (上官桀) (d. 80 BCE) over the court of his successor, the child Liu Fuling, known posthumously as [[Emperor Zhao of Han]] (r. 87–74 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 178&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Jin Midi died a year later and by 80 BCE Shangguan Jie and Imperial Counselor Sang Hongyang were executed when they were accused of supporting Emperor Zhao's older brother Liu Dan (劉旦) the King of Yan as emperor; this gave Huo unrivaled power.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (1988), 44; Loewe (1986), 180–182; ''Zizhi tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷023|vol. 23]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not abuse his power in the eyes of the Confucian establishment and gained popularity for reducing Emperor Wu's taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;huang 1988 45&quot;&gt;Huang (1988), 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor Zhao died in 74 BCE without a successor, while the one chosen to replace him on July 18, his nephew [[Prince He of Changyi]], was removed on August 14 after displaying a lack of character or capacity to rule.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (1988), 44; Loewe (1986), 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince He's removal was secured with a [[memorial to the throne|memorial]] signed by all the leading ministers and submitted to [[Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan|Empress Dowager Shangguan]] for approval.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 183 184&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu Bingyi (Liu Ju's grandson) was named [[Emperor Xuan of Han]] (r. 74–49 BCE) on September 10.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 184&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Huo Guang remained in power as regent over Emperor Xuan until he died of natural causes in 68 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (1988), 46; Loewe (1986), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in 66 BCE the Huo clan was charged with conspiracy against the throne and eliminated.&lt;ref name=&quot;huang 1988 46&quot;&gt;Huang (1988), 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the culmination of Emperor Xuan's revenge after Huo Guang's wife had poisoned his beloved [[Empress Xu Pingjun]] in 71 BCE only to have her replaced by Huo Guang's daughter [[Empress Huo Chengjun]] (the latter was deposed in September 66 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 185 187&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu Shi, son of Empress Xu, succeeded his father as [[Emperor Yuan of Han]] (r. 49–33 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 185 187&quot;/&gt;

During Emperor Wu's reign and Huo Guang's regency, the dominant political faction was the Modernist Party. This party favored greater government intervention in the private economy with government monopolies over salt and iron, higher taxes exacted on private business, and price controls which were used to fund an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion; they also followed the Qin dynasty approach to discipline by meting out more punishments for faults and less rewards for service.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 187–197; Chang (2007), 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; After Huo Guang's regency, the Reformist Party gained more leverage over state affairs and policy decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 187 197&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 187–197.&lt;/ref&gt; This party favored the abolishment of government monopolies, limited government intervention in the private economy, a moderate foreign policy, limited colonization efforts, frugal budget reform, and a return to the Zhou dynasty ideal of granting more rewards for service to display the dynasty's magnanimity.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 187–206.&lt;/ref&gt; This party's influence can be seen in the abolition of the central government's salt and iron monopolies in 44 BCE, yet these were reinstated in 41 BCE, only to be abolished again during the 1st century CE and transferred to local administrations and private entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (2001), 16–19.&lt;/ref&gt; By 66 BCE the Reformists had many of the lavish spectacles, games, and entertainments installed by Emperor Wu to impress foreign dignitaries cancelled on the grounds that they were excessive and ostentatious.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 196&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred by alleged [[Tian|signs from Heaven]] warning the ruler of his incompetence, a total of eighteen general amnesties were granted during the combined reigns of Emperor Yuan (Liu Shi) and [[Emperor Cheng of Han]] (r. 37-3 BCE, Liu Ao 劉驁).&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 201&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Yuan reduced the severity of punishment for several crimes, while Cheng reduced the length of judicial procedures in 34 BCE since they were disrupting the lives of commoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 201&quot;/&gt; While the Modernists had accepted sums of cash from criminals to have their sentences commuted or even dropped, the Reformists reversed this policy since it favored the wealthy over the poor and was not an effective deterrent against crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 201 202&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor Cheng made major reforms to state-sponsored religion. The Qin dynasty had worshipped four main legendary deities, with another added by Emperor Gaozu in 205 BCE; these were the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Powers, or Wudi]] (五帝).&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 208&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 208.&lt;/ref&gt; In 31 BCE Emperor Cheng, in an effort to gain Heaven's favor and bless him with a male heir, halted all ceremonies dedicated to the Five Powers and replaced them with ceremonies for the supreme god [[Shangdi]], who the kings of Zhou had worshipped.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 208; Csikszentmihalyi (2006), xxv–xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations and war===

The first half of the 1st century BCE witnessed several succession crises for the Xiongnu leadership, allowing Han to further cement its control over the Western Regions.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1986), 196–198; Yü (1986), 392–394.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han general [[Fu Jiezi]] assassinated the pro-Xiongnu King of Loulan in 77 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 409.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han formed a coalition with the [[Wusun]], [[Dingling]], and [[Wuhuan]], and the coalition forces inflicted a major defeat against the Xiongnu in 72 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 410 411&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han regained its influence over the [[Turpan Depression]] after defeating the Xiongnu at the [[Battle of Jushi]] in 67 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 410 411&quot;/&gt; In 65 BCE Han was able to install a new King of [[Kucha]] (a state north of the [[Taklamakan Desert]]) who would be agreeable to Han interests in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewe 1986 197&quot;&gt;Loewe (1986), 197.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Official of the Western Regions|The office]] of the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]], first given to [[Zheng Ji (Han dynasty general)|Zheng Ji]] (d. 49 BCE), was established in 60 BCE to supervise colonial activities and conduct relations with the small kingdoms of the Tarim Basin.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 410–411; Loewe (1986), 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Zhizhi Chanyu]] (r. 56–36 BCE) had inflicted a serious defeat against his rival brother and royal contender Huhanye Chanyu (呼韓邪) (r. 58–31 BCE), Huhanye and his supporters debated whether to request Han aid and become a Han vassal.  He decided to do so in 52 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 394; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Huhanye sent his son as a hostage to Han and personally paid homage to Emperor Xuan during the 51 BCE [[Chinese New Year]] celebration.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 395&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 395.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the advocacy of the Reformists, Huhanye was seated as a distinguished guest of honor and rich rewards of 5&amp;nbsp;kg (160 [[troy ounce|oz t]]) of gold, 200,000 cash coins, 77 suits of clothes, 8,000 bales of silk fabric, 1,500&amp;nbsp;kg (3,300&amp;nbsp;lb) of silk floss, and 15 horses, in addition to 680,000 L (19,300 [[U.S. bushel|U.S. bu]]) of grain sent to him when he returned home.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 395–396; Loewe (1986), 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gilded Bronze Handle of a Dragon, Eastern Han.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Gilding|gilded]] bronze handle (now disconnected from the ware) in the shape [[Chinese dragon|of a dragon's]] head and neck, Eastern Han Era]]

Huhanye Chanyu and his successors were encouraged to pay further trips of homage to the Han court due to the [[Economy of the Han dynasty|increasing amount of gifts showered on them after each visit]]; this was a cause for complaint by some ministers in 3 BCE, yet the financial consequence of pampering their vassal was deemed superior to the ''heqin'' agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 396 397&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 396–397.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhizhi Chanyu initially attempted to send hostages and tribute to the Han court in hopes of ending the Han support of Huhanye, but eventually turned against Han.  Subsequently, the Han general [[Chen Tang]] and Protector General Gan Yanshou (甘延壽/甘延寿), acting without explicit permission from the Han court, [[Battle of Zhizhi|killed Zhizhi]] at his capital of Shanyu City (in modern [[Taraz]], [[Kazakhstan]]) in 36 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 396–398; Loewe (1986), 211–213; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷029|vol. 29]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Reformist Han court, reluctant to award independent missions let alone foreign interventionism, gave Chen and Gan only modest rewards.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986) 396–398; Loewe (1986), 211–213&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the show of favor, Huhanye was not given a Han princess; instead, he was given the Lady [[Wang Zhaojun]], one of the [[Four Beauties]] of ancient China.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 398&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 398.&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a departure from the earlier heqin agreement, where a Chinese princess was handed over to the Chanyu as his bride.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 398&quot;/&gt;

==Wang Mang's usurpation==

===Wang Mang seizes control===
The long life of [[Empress Wang Zhengjun]] (71 BCE–13 CE), wife of Emperor Yuan and mother to Emperor Cheng, ensured that her male relatives would be appointed one after another to the role of regent, officially known as Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 225–226; Huang (1988), 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Cheng, who was more interested in [[cockfighting]] and chasing after beautiful women than administering the empire, left much of the affairs of state to his relatives of the Wang clan.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 225–226; Loewe (1986), 213.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 28, 8 BCE [[Wang Mang]] (45 BCE–23 CE), a nephew of Empress Dowager Wang, became the new General-in-Chief.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 225 226&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 225–226.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when [[Emperor Ai of Han]] (r. 7–1 BCE, Liu Xin) took the throne, his grandmother [[Consort Fu]] (Emperor Yuan's [[concubine]]) became the leading figure in the palace and forced Wang Mang to resign on August 27, 7 BCE, followed by his forced departure from the capital to his [[marquess]]ate in 5 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 227; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷033|vol. 33]]; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷034|vol. 34]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze mirror, Han Dynasty.JPG|thumb|left|The raised-relief decorated reverse side [[TLV mirror|of a Han bronze mirror]] showing animal figures representing the [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]]]]
Due to pressure from Wang's supporters, Emperor Ai invited Wang Mang back to the capital in 2 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 227 228&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 227–228.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later Emperor Ai died of illness without a son.

Wang Mang had a grand vision to restore China to a fabled [[golden age]] achieved in the early Zhou dynasty, the era which Confucius had idealized.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (2000), 134; Lewis (2007), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted sweeping reforms, including the [[History of slavery|outlawing of slavery]] and institution of the [[Well-field system|King's Fields]] system in 9 CE, nationalizing land ownership and allotting a standard amount of land to each family.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (2000), 134; Bielenstein (1986), 232; Lewis (2007), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was reestablished and the land reform regime was cancelled in 12 CE due to widespread protest.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2007), 23; Bielenstein (1986), 234; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Ban Gu]] (32–92 CE) wrote that Wang's reforms led to his downfall, yet aside from slavery and land reform, historian [[Hans Bielenstein]] points out that most of Wang's reforms were in line with earlier Han policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 232 233&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his new [[Denomination (currency)|denominations of currency]] introduced in 7 CE, 9 CE, 10 CE, and 14 CE [[Economy of the Han dynasty|debased the value of coinage]], earlier introductions of lighter-weight currencies resulted in economic damage as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 232–233; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang renamed all the commanderies of the empire as well as bureaucratic titles, yet there were precedents for this as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 233&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The government monopolies were rescinded in 22 CE because they could no longer be enforced during a large-scale rebellion against him (spurred by massive flooding of the [[Yellow River]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 234; Hinsch (2002), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The half-Chinese, half-Xiongnu noble Yituzhiyashi (伊屠智牙師), son of Huhanye Chanyu and Wang Zhaojun, became a vocal partisan for Han China within the Xiongnu realm; Bielenstein claims that this led conservative Xiongnu nobles to anticipate a break in the alliance with Han.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 236&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; The moment came when Wang Mang assumed the throne and demoted the Chanyu to a lesser rank; this became a pretext for war.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 237&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 237.&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter of 10–11 CE, Wang amassed 300,000 troops along the northern border of Han China, a show of force which led the Xiongnu to back down.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 237&quot;/&gt; Yet when raiding continued, Wang Mang had the princely Xiongnu hostage held by Han authorities executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 237&quot;/&gt; Diplomatic relations were repaired when Xian (咸) (r. 13–18 CE) became the chanyu, only to be soiled again when Huduershi Chanyu (呼都而尸) (r. 18–46 CE) took the throne and raided Han's borders in 19 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 238&quot;/&gt;

The Tarim Basin kingdom of [[Yanqi Hui Autonomous County|Yanqi]] ([[Karasahr]], located east of Kucha, west of Turpan) rebelled against Xin authority in 13 CE, killing Han's Protector General Dan Qin (但欽).&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 238&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Mang sent a force to retaliate against Karasahr in 16 CE, quelling their resistance and ensuring that the region would remain under Chinese control until the widespread rebellion against Wang Mang toppled his rule in 23 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 238&quot;/&gt; Wang also extended Chinese influence over [[Tibet]]an tribes in the [[Qinghai|Kokonor region]] and fended off an attack in 12 CE by Goguryeo (an early Korean state located around the [[Yalu River]]) in the [[Korean peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 238–239; Yü (1986), 450.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the widespread rebellion in China mounted from 20–23 CE, the Koreans raided Lelang Commandery and Han did not reassert itself in the region until 30 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 450&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 450.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 3 CE, the course of the Yellow River had emptied into the [[Bohai Sea]] at [[Tianjin]], but the gradual buildup of silt in its riverbed—which raised the water level each year—overpowered the dikes built to prevent flooding and the river split in two, with one arm flowing south of the [[Shandong Peninsula]] and into the [[East China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (2000), 135; Bielenstein (1986), 241–242; de Crespigny (2007), 196.&lt;/ref&gt; A second flood in 11 CE changed the course of the northern branch of the river so that it emptied slightly north of the Shandong Peninsula, yet far south of Tianjin.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (2000), 135; Bielenstein (1986), 241–242&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; With much of the southern [[North China Plain]] inundated following the creation of the Yellow River's southern branch, thousands of starving peasants who were displaced from their homes formed groups of bandits and rebels, most notably the [[Chimei|Red Eyebrows]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (2000), 135; de Crespigny (2007), 196; Bielenstein (1986), 243–244.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Mang's armies tried to quell these rebellions in 18 and 22 CE but failed.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 196; Bielenstein (1986), 243–244&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liu Yan (Bosheng)|Liu Yan]] (d. 23 CE), a descendant of Emperor Jing, led a group of rebelling [[Gentry (China)|gentry]] groups [[Nanyang, Henan|from Nanyang]] who had Yan's third cousin Liu Xuan (劉玄) accept the title [[Emperor Gengshi of Han]] (r. 23–25) on March 11, 23 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 246; de Crespigny (2007), 558; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷038|vol. 38]].&lt;/ref&gt; Liu Xiu, a brother of Liu Yan and future [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] (r. 25–57 CE), distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Kunyang]] on July 7, 23 CE when he relieved a city sieged by Wang Mang's forces and turned the tide of the war.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 558–559; Bielenstein (1986), 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, Emperor Gengshi had Liu Yan executed on grounds of treason and Liu Xiu, fearing for his life, resigned from office as [[Nine Ministers|Minister of Ceremonies]] and avoided public mourning for his brother; for this, the emperor gave Liu Xiu a marquessate and a promotion as general.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 558 559&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 558–559.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gengshi's forces then targeted Chang'an, but a local insurgency broke out in the capital, sacking the city on October 4. From October 4–6 Wang Mang made a last stand at the [[Weiyang Palace]] only to be killed and decapitated; his head was sent to Gengshi's headquarters at Wan (i.e., Nanyang) before Gengshi's armies even reached Chang'an on October 9.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 248; de Crespigny (2007), 568.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hymes&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Hymes|editor=John Stewart Bowman|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-11004-4|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Gengshi settled [[Luoyang]] as his new capital where he invited Red Eyebrows leader Fan Chong (樊崇) to stay, yet Gengshi granted him only honorary titles, so Fan decided to flee once his men began to desert him.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 248–249; de Crespigny (2007), 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Gengshi moved the capital back to Chang'an in 24 CE, yet in the following year the Red Eyebrows defeated his forces, appointed their own puppet ruler [[Liu Penzi]], entered Chang'an and captured the fleeing Gengshi who they demoted as King of Changsha before killing him.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 197, 560, &amp; 569; Bielenstein (1986), 249–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

While acting as a commissioner under Emperor Gengshi, Liu Xiu gathered a significant following after putting down a local rebellion (in what is now [[Hebei]] province).&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 559 560&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 559–560.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the Han throne himself on August 5, 25 CE and occupied Luoyang as his capital on November 27.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hymes&quot; /&gt; Before he would eventually unify the empire, there were 11 others who claimed the title of emperor.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 560; Bielenstein (1986), 251.&lt;/ref&gt; With the efforts of his officers [[Deng Yu]] and [[Feng Yi]], Guangwu forced the wandering Red Eyebrows to surrender on March 15, 27 CE, resettling them at Luoyang, yet had their leader Fan Chong executed when a plot of rebellion was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 197–198 &amp; 560; Bielenstein (1986), 251–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 26–30 CE, Guangwu defeated various warlords and conquered the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] and Shandong Peninsula in the east.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 560–561; Bielenstein (1986), 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Allying with the warlord Dou Rong (竇融) of the distant Hexi Corridor in 29 CE, Guangwu nearly defeated the Gansu warlord Wei Xiao (隗囂/隗嚣) in 32 CE, seizing Wei's domain in 33 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 254; Crespigny (2007), 561.&lt;/ref&gt; The last adversary standing was Gongsun Shu (公孫述), whose base was at [[Chengdu]] in modern [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 254; de Crespigny (2007), 269 &amp; 561.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Guangwu's forces successfully burned down Gongsun's fortified [[pontoon bridge]] stretching across the [[Yangzi River]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 255&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Guangwu's commanding general Cen Peng (岑彭) was killed in 35 CE by an assassin sent by Gongsun Shu.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Wu Han (Han dynasty)|Han General Wu Han]] (d. 44 CE) resumed Cen's campaign along the Yangzi [[Min River (Sichuan)|and Min]] rivers and destroyed Gongsun's forces by December 36 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 255; de Crespigny (2007), 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Chang'an is located west of Luoyang, the names Western Han (202 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 9 CE) and Eastern Han (25–220 CE) are accepted by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsch (2002), 24–25; Cullen (2006), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Luoyang's 10&amp;nbsp;m (32&amp;nbsp;ft) tall eastern, western, and northern walls still stand today, although the southern wall was destroyed when the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] changed its course.&lt;ref&gt;Wang (1982), 29–30; Bielenstein (1986), 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Within its walls it had [[Chinese Palaces|two prominent palaces]], both of which existed during Western Han, but were expanded by Guangwu and his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Wang (1982), 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; While Eastern Han Luoyang is estimated to have held roughly 500,000 inhabitants,&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 2000 135 136&quot;&gt;Hansen (2000), 135–136.&lt;/ref&gt; the first known [[census]] data for the whole of China, dated 2 CE, recorded a population of nearly 58 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 73&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing this to the census of 140 CE (when the total population was registered at roughly 48 million),&lt;ref name=&quot;nishijima 1986 595 596&quot;&gt;Nishijima (1986), 595–596.&lt;/ref&gt; there was a significant migratory shift of up to 10 million people from [[Northern and southern China|northern to southern China]] during Eastern Han, largely because of natural disasters and wars with nomadic groups in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey (1999), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Population size fluctuated according to periodically updated Eastern-Han censuses, but historian Sadao Nishijima notes that this does not reflect a dramatic loss of life, but rather government inability at times to register the entire populace.&lt;ref name=&quot;nishijima 1986 595 596&quot;/&gt;

Scrapping Wang Mang's denominations of currency, Emperor Guangwu reintroduced Western Han's standard five ''shu'' coin in 40 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1986 609&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1986), 609.&lt;/ref&gt; Making up for lost revenue after the salt and iron monopolies were canceled, [[Economy of the Han dynasty|private manufacturers were heavily taxed]] while the government purchased its armies' swords and shields from private businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1986 609&quot;/&gt; In 31 CE he allowed peasants to pay a military substitution tax to avoid [[conscription]] into the armed forces for a year of training and year of service; instead he built a [[Military volunteer|volunteer force]] which lasted throughout Eastern Han.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 564 565&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 564–565.&lt;/ref&gt; He also allowed peasants to avoid the one-month [[corvée]] duty with a commutable tax as [[Day labor|hired labor]] became more popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1986 613&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1986), 613.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Mang had demoted all Han marquesses to commoner status, yet Guangwu made an effort from 27 CE onwards to find their relatives and restore abolished marquessates.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 256&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emperor Ming of Han]] (r. 57–75 CE, Liu Yang) reestablished the Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization and the price stabilization system where the government bought grain when cheap and sold it to the public when private commercial prices were high due to limited stocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 605&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 605.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he canceled the prize stabilization scheme in 68 CE when he became convinced that government hoarding of grain only made wealthy merchants even richer.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 605&quot;/&gt; With the renewed economic prosperity brought about by his father's reign, Emperor Ming addressed the flooding of the Yellow River by repairing various dams and canals.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 606&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 606.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, 70 CE, an edict boasted that the southern branch of the Yellow River emptying south of the Shandong Peninsula was finally cut off by Han engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 243&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 243.&lt;/ref&gt; A patron of scholarship, Emperor Ming also established a school for young nobles aside from the Imperial University.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 608–609.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emperor Zhang of Han]] (r. 75–88 CE, Liu Da) faced an agrarian crisis when a cattle epidemic broke out in 76 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 496&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 496.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing disaster relief, Zhang also made reforms to legal procedures and lightened existing punishments with the [[bastinado]], since he believed that this would restore the seasonal balance of ''yin'' and ''yang'' and cure the epidemic.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 496&quot;/&gt; To further display his benevolence, in 78 CE he ceased the corvée work on canal works of the Hutuo River running through the [[Taihang Mountains]], believing it was causing too much hardship for the people; in 85 CE he granted a three-year poll tax exemption for any woman who gave birth and exempted their husbands for a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 496&quot;/&gt; Unlike other Eastern Han rulers who sponsored the [[Old Texts|New Texts]] tradition of the Confucian Five Classics, Zhang was a patron of the [[Old Texts]] tradition and held scholarly debates on the validity of the schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 498&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 498.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rafe de Crespigny]] writes that the major reform of the Eastern Han period was Zhang's reintroduction in 85 CE of an amended [[Chinese calendar|''Sifen'' calendar, replacing Emperor Wu's ''Taichu'' calendar]] of 104 BCE which had [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|become inaccurate over two centuries]] (the former measured the [[tropical year]] at 365.25 days like the [[Julian Calendar]], while the latter measured the tropical year at 365&lt;sup&gt;385&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;1539&lt;/sub&gt; days and the [[lunar month]] at 29&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;81&lt;/sub&gt; days).&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 498; Deng (2005), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emperor He of Han]] (r. 88–105 CE, Liu Zhao) was tolerant of both New Text and Old Text traditions, though orthodox studies were in decline and works skeptical of New Texts, such as [[Wang Chong]]'s (27&amp;nbsp;– c. 100 CE) ''[[Lunheng]]'', disillusioned the scholarly community with that tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 591&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 591.&lt;/ref&gt; He also showed an interest in history when he commissioned the Lady [[Ban Zhao]] (45–116 CE) to use the imperial archives in order to complete the ''[[Book of Han]]'', the work of her deceased [[Ban Biao|father]] and [[Ban Gu|brother]].&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 591; Hansen (2000), 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; This set an important precedent of imperial control over the recording of history and thus was unlike Sima Qian's far more independent work, the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (109–91 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 2000 137 138&quot;&gt;Hansen (2000), 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; When plagues of locusts, floods, and earthquakes disrupted the lives of commoners, Emperor He's relief policies were to cut taxes, open granaries, provide government loans, forgive private debts, and resettle people away from disaster areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 592&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that a severe drought in 94 CE was the cosmological result of injustice in the legal system, Emperor He personally inspected prisons.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 592&quot;/&gt; When he found that some had false charges levelled against them, he sent the Prefect of Luoyang to prison; rain allegedly came soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 592&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, Huduershi Chanyu was succeeded by his son Punu (蒲奴) in 46 CE, thus breaking Huhanye's orders that only a Xiongnu ruler's brother was a valid successor; Huduershi's nephew Bi (比) was outraged and in 48 CE was proclaimed a rival Chanyu.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 399 400&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 399–400.&lt;/ref&gt; This split created the [[Xiongnu#Northern Xiongnu|Northern Xiongnu]] and [[Xiongnu#Southern Xiongnu|Southern Xiongnu]], and like Huhanye before him, Bi turned to the Han for aid in 50 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 399 400&quot;/&gt; When Bi came to pay homage to the Han court, he was given 10,000 bales of silk fabrics, 2,500&amp;nbsp;kg (5,500&amp;nbsp;lb) of silk, 500,000 L (14,000 U.S. bu) of rice, and 36,000 head of cattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 399 400&quot;/&gt; Unlike in Huhanye's time, however, the Southern Xiongnu were overseen by a Han Prefect who not only acted as an arbiter in Xiongnu legal cases, but also monitored the movements of the Chanyu and his followers who were settled in Han's northern commanderies in Shanxi, Gansu, and [[Inner Mongolia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 401&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 401.&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Xiongnu attempts to enter Han's tributary system were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Xin's loss of the Western Territories, the [[Yarkant County|Kingdom of Yarkand]] looked after the Chinese officials and families stranded in the Tarim Basin and fought the Xiongnu for control over it.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 413 414&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 413–414.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Guangwu, preoccupied with civil wars in China, simply granted King Kang of Yarkand an official title in 29 CE and in 41 CE made his successor King Xian a Protector General (later reduced to the honorary title of &quot;Great General of Han&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 413 414&quot;/&gt; Yarkand overtaxed its subjects of [[Khotan]], Turpan, Kucha, and Karasahr, all of which decided to ally with the Northern Xiongnu.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 413 414&quot;/&gt; By 61 CE Khotan had conquered Yarkand, yet this led to a war among the kingdoms to decide which would be the next hegemon.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 413 414&quot;/&gt; The Northern Xiongnu took advantage of the infighting, conquered the Tarim Basin, and used it as a base to stage raids into Han's Hexi Corridor by 63 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 413 414&quot;/&gt; In that year, the Han court opened border markets for trade with the Northern Xiongnu in hopes to appease them.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 404&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Han sought to reconquer the Tarim Basin. At the [[Battle of Yiwulu]] in 73 CE, [[Dou Gu]] (d. 88 CE) reached as far as [[Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County|Lake Barkol]] when he defeated a Northern Xiongnu chanyu and established an agricultural garrison [[Hami Prefecture|at Hami]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 414 415&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 414–415.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dou Gu was able to evict the Xiongnu from Turpan in 74 CE, when the Han appointed [[Chen Mu]] (d. 75 CE) as the new Protector General of the Western Regions, the Northern Xiongnu invaded the [[Bogda Shan|Bogda Mountains]] while their allies Karasarh and Kucha killed Chen Mu and his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 73&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han garrison at Hami was forced to withdraw in 77 CE (and was not reestablished until 91 CE).&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 415 420&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 415 &amp; 420.&lt;/ref&gt; The next Han expedition against the Northern Xiongnu was led in 89 CE by [[Dou Xian]] (d. 92 CE); at the [[Battle of Ikh Bayan]], Dou's forces chased [[Northern Chanyu (1st century)|the Northern Chanyu]] into the [[Altai Mountains]], allegedly killing 13,000 Xiongnu and accepting the surrender of 200,000 Xiongnu from 81 tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 415; de Crespigny (2007), 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Dou sent 2,000 cavalry to attack the Northern Xiongnu base at Hami, he was followed by the initiative of the general [[Ban Chao]] (d. 102 CE),&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 415&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 415.&lt;/ref&gt; who earlier installed a new [[Kashgar#History|king of Kashgar]] as a Han ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 5&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; When this king turned against him and enlisted the aid of [[Sogdiana]] in 84 CE, Ban Chao arranged an alliance with the [[Kushan Empire]] (of modern [[North India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Tajikistan]]), which put political pressure on Sogdiana to back down; Ban later assassinated King Zhong of Kashgar.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 5&quot;/&gt; Since Kushan provided aid to Ban Chao in quelling Turpan and sent tribute and hostages to Han, its ruler [[Vima Kadphises]] (r. c. 90&amp;nbsp;– c. 100 CE) requested a Chinese princess bride; when this was rejected in 90 CE, Kushan marched 70,000 troops to [[Wakhan]] against Ban Chao.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crespigny 2007&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 6; Torday (1997), 393.&lt;/ref&gt; Ban used [[scorched earth]] tactics against Kushan, forcing them to request food supplies from Kucha. When Kushan messengers were intercepted by Ban, Kushan was forced to withdraw.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crespigny 2007&quot;/&gt; In 91 CE, Ban was appointed as Protector General of the Western Regions, an office he filled until 101 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 415 416&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 415–416.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tributary gifts and emissaries from the [[Arsacid Empire]], then under [[Pacorus II of Parthia]] (r. 78–105 CE), came to the Han in 87 CE, 89 CE, and 101 CE bringing exotic animals such as [[ostrich]]es and [[lion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 497 &amp; 590.&lt;/ref&gt; When Ban Chao dispatched his emissary [[Gan Ying]] in 97 CE to reach [[Daqin]] (the Roman Empire), he did not reach farther than a &quot;large sea&quot;, perhaps the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 460–461; de Crespigny (2007), 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from oral accounts Gan was able to describe Rome as having hundreds of walled cities, a [[mail|postal delivery network]], the submission of dependent states, and a [[Roman Constitution|system of government]] where the [[Roman consul|Roman &quot;king&quot; (i.e. consul)]] is &quot;[[term limits|not a permanent figure]] but is [[Roman assemblies|chosen as the man most worthy]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wood (2002), 46–47; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants and rhinoceroses were also presented as gifts to the Han court in 94 CE and 97 CE [[Pyu city-states|by a king]] in what is now [[Burma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 591&quot;/&gt; [[Wa (Japan)|The first known diplomatic mission]] from a ruler in [[Japan]] came in 57 CE (followed by another in 107 CE); a golden seal of Emperor Guangwu's was even discovered in 1784 in [[Chikuzen Province]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 450 451&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 450–451.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Ying (prince)|The first mentioning]] of [[Buddhism]] in China was made in 65 CE, when the Chinese clearly associated it with Huang-Lao Daoism.&lt;ref&gt;Demiéville (1986), 821–822.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Ming had the first Buddhist temple of China—the [[White Horse Temple]]—built at Luoyang in honor of [[Bhikkhu|two foreign monks]]: Jiashemoteng (迦葉摩騰) ([[Kasyapa Matanga|Kāśyapa Mātanga]]) and Zhu Falan (竺法蘭) ([[Dharmaratna]] the Indian).&lt;ref name=&quot;demieville 1986 823&quot;&gt;Demiéville (1986), 823.&lt;/ref&gt; These monks allegedly translated the ''[[Sutra of Forty-two Chapters]]'' from [[Sanskrit]] into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], although it is now proven that this text was not translated into Chinese until the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Demieville (1986), 823; Akira (1998), 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his divorcing [[Guo Shengtong]] in 41 CE to install his original wife [[Empress Yin Lihua]] as empress instead, there was little drama [[Chinese kinship|with imperial kinsmen]] at Guangwu's court, as Empress Guo was made a queen dowager and her son, the former heir apparent, was demoted to the status of a king.&lt;ref&gt;Beilenstein (1986), 278; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷040|vol. 40]]; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷043|vol. 43]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, trouble with imperial kinsmen turned violent during Ming's reign. In addition to exiling his half-brother [[Liu Ying (prince)|Liu Ying]] (d. 71 CE, committed suicide) after Liu Ying allegedly used witchcraft to curse him, Emperor Ming also targeted hundreds of others with similar charges (of using occult omens and witchcraft) resulting in exile, torture for gaining confessions, and execution.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 257–258; de Crespigny (2007), 607–608.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend of persecution did not end until Emperor Zhang took the throne, who was for the most part generous towards his brothers and called back many to the capital who had been exiled by Ming.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 499&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of greater consequence for the dynasty, however, was Emperor He's coup of 92 CE in which [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] made their first significant involvement in court politics of Eastern Han.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 2000 136&quot;&gt;Hansen (2000), 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Zhang had upheld a good relationship with his titular mother and Ming's widow, the humble [[Empress Ma (Han dynasty)|Empress Dowager Ma]] (d. 79 CE),&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 499&quot;/&gt; but [[Empress Dou (Zhang)|Empress Dowager Dou]] (d. 97 CE), the widow of Emperor Zhang, was overbearing towards Emperor He (son of Emperor Zhang and [[Consort Liang]]) in his early reign and, concealing the identity of his natural mother from him, raised He as her own after purging the Liang family from power.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 499 &amp; 588–589.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to put He on the throne, Empress Dowager Dou had even demoted the crown prince [[Liu Qing (prince)|Liu Qing]] (78–106 CE) as a king and forced his mother, [[Consort Song]] (d. 82 CE) to commit suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 280 281&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 280–281.&lt;/ref&gt; Unwilling to yield his power to the Dou clan any longer, Emperor He enlisted the aid of palace eunuchs led by [[Zheng Zhong]] (d. 107 CE) to overthrow the Dou clan on charges of treason, stripping them of titles, exiling them, forcing many to commit suicide, and had the Empress Dowager placed under [[house arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 589; Bielenstein (1986), 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empress Deng Sui]] (d. 121 CE), widow to Emperor He, became empress dowager in 105 CE and thus had the final say in appointing He's successor (since he had appointed none); she placed his infant son Liu Long on the throne, later known as [[Emperor Shang of Han]] (r. 105–106).&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 531; Bielenstein (1986), 283.&lt;/ref&gt; When the latter died at only age one, she placed his young nephew Liu Hu (Liu Qing's son) on the throne, known posthumously as [[Emperor An of Han]] (r. 106–125 CE), bypassing Emperor He's other son Liu Sheng (劉勝).&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 283; de Crespigny (2007), 122–123; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷049|vol. 49]].&lt;/ref&gt; With a young ruler on the throne, Empress Deng was the ''de facto'' ruler until her death, since her brother Deng Zhi's (鄧騭) brief occupation as the General-in-Chief (大將軍) from 109–110 CE did not in fact make him the ruling regent.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 122–123; Bielenstein (1986), 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; With her death on April 17, 121 CE, Emperor An accepted the charge of eunuchs Li Run (李閏) and Jiang Jing (江京) that she had plotted to overthrow him; on June 3 he charged the Deng clan with treason and had them dismissed from office, stripped of title, reduced to commoner status, exiled to remote areas, and drove many to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 284; de Crespigny (2007), 128 &amp; 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yan clan of [[Empress Yan Ji]] (d. 126 CE), wife of Emperor An, and the eunuchs Jiang Jing and Fan Feng (樊豐) pressured Emperor An to demote his nine-year-old heir apparent Liu Bao to the status of a king on October 5, 124 CE on charges of conspiracy, despite protests from senior government officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 284 285 de crespigny 2007 582 583&quot;&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 284–285; de Crespigny (2007), 582–583.&lt;/ref&gt; When Emperor An died on April 30, 125 CE the Empress Dowager Yan was free to choose his successor, Liu Yi (grandson of Emperor Zhang), who is known as [[Marquess of Beixiang|Emperor Shao of Han]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1986 284 285 de crespigny 2007 582 583&quot;/&gt; After the child died suddenly in 125 CE, the eunuch [[Sun Cheng]] (d. 132 CE) made a palace coup, slaughtering the opposing eunuchs, and thrust Liu Bao on the throne, later to be known as [[Emperor Shun of Han]] (r. 125–144 CE); Sun then put Empress Dowager Yan under house arrest, had her brothers killed, and the rest of her family exiled to Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 284–285; de Crespigny (2007), 473–474.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pottery figure 4.JPG|thumb|left|A Han dynasty painted pottery head now broken off from its body]]
Emperor Shun had no sons with [[Empress Liang Na]] (d. 150 CE), yet when his son Liu Bing [[Emperor Chong of Han|briefly took the throne]] in 145 CE, the mother of the latter, Consort Yu, was in no position of power to challenge Empress Dowager Liang.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 285; de Crespigny (2007), 477–478, 595–596.&lt;/ref&gt; After the child [[Emperor Zhi of Han]] (r. 145–146 CE) briefly sat on the throne, Empress Dowager Liang and her brother [[Liang Ji]] (d. 159 CE), now regent General-in-Chief, decided that Liu Zhi, known posthumously as [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146–168 CE), should take the throne, as he was betrothed to their sister [[Empress Liang Nüying|Liang Nüying]].&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986) 285; de Crespigny (2007), 477–478, 595–596; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷053|vol. 53]].&lt;/ref&gt; When the younger Empress Liang died in 159 CE, Liang Ji attempted to control Emperor Huan's new favorite [[Empress Deng Mengnü|Consort Deng Mengnü]] (later empress) (d. 165 CE).  When she resisted Liang Ji had her brother-in-law killed, prompting Emperor Huan to use eunuchs to oust Liang Ji from power; the latter committed suicide when his residence was surrounded by imperial guards.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 285–286; de Crespigny (1986), 597–598.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Huan died with no official heir, so his third wife [[Empress Dou Miao]] (d. 172 CE), now the empress dowager, had Liu Hong, known posthumously as [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. 168–189 CE), take the throne.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 510; Beck (1986), 317–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

To mitigate the damage caused by a series of natural disasters, Empress Dowager Deng's government attempted various relief measures of tax remissions, donations to the poor, and immediate shipping of government grain to the most hard-hit areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 126&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some water control works were repaired in 115 CE and 116 CE, many government projects became underfunded due to these relief efforts and the armed response to the large-scale Qiang people's rebellion of 107–118 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 126 127&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of her financial constraints, the Empress Dowager limited the expenses at banquets, the fodder for imperial horses who weren't pulling carriages, and the amount of luxury goods manufactured by the imperial workshops.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 126&quot;/&gt; She approved the sale of some civil offices and even secondary marquess ranks to collect more revenue; the sale of offices was continued by Emperor Huan and became extremely prevalent during Emperor Ling's reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 126 127&quot;/&gt;

Emperor An continued similar disaster relief programs that Empress Dowager Deng had implemented, though he reversed some of her decisions, such as a 116 CE edict requiring officials to leave office for three years of mourning after the death of a parent (an ideal Confucian [[Mores|more]]). Since this seemed to contradict Confucian morals, Emperor An's sponsorship of renowned scholars was aimed at shoring up popularity among Confucians.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 581 582&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 581–582.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xu Shen]] (58–147 CE), although an Old Text scholar and thus not aligned with the New Text tradition sponsored by Emperor An, enhanced the emperor's Confucian credentials when he presented his [[Chinese dictionaries|groundbreaking dictionary]] to the court, the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 581 582&quot;/&gt;

Financial troubles only worsened in Emperor Shun's reign, as many public works projects were handled at the local level without the central government's assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 475&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet his court still managed to supervise the major efforts of disaster relief, aided in part by a new invention in 132 CE of a [[seismometer]] by the [[Chinese astronomy|court astronomer]] [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139 CE) who used a complex system of a vibration-sensitive swinging [[pendulum]], mechanical gears, and falling metal balls to [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|determine the direction of earthquakes hundreds of kilometers (miles) away]].&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 474–475 &amp; 1049–1051; Minford &amp; Lau (2002), 307; Needham (1965), 30, 484, 632, 627–630.&lt;/ref&gt; Shun's greatest patronage of scholarship was repairing the now dilapidated Imperial University in 131 CE, which still operated as a pathway for young gentrymen to enter civil service.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 477&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 477.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials protested against the enfeoffment of eunuch Sun Cheng and his associates as marquesses, with further protest in 135 CE when Shun allowed the sons of eunuchs to inherit their fiefs, yet the larger concern was over the rising power of the Liang faction.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 475; Bielenstein (1986), 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt;

To abate the unseemly image of placing child emperors on the throne, Liang Ji attempted to paint himself as a populist by granting general amnesties, awarding people with noble ranks, reducing the severity of penalties (the bastinado was no longer used), allowing exiled families to return home, and allowing convicts to settle on new land in the frontier.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 596 597&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 596–597.&lt;/ref&gt; Under his stewardship, the Imperial University was given a formal examination system whereby candidates would take exams on different classics over a period of years in order to gain entrance into public office.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 596.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these positive reforms, Liang Ji was widely accused of corruption and greed.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 597&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 597.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet when Emperor Huan overthrew Liang by using eunuch allies, students of the Imperial University took to streets in the thousands chanting the names of the eunuchs they opposed in one of the earliest [[student protest]]s in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 2000 141&quot;&gt;Hansen (2000), 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Liang Ji was overthrown, Huan distanced himself from the Confucian establishment and instead sought legitimacy through a revived imperial patronage of Huang-Lao Daoism; this renewed patronage of Huang-Lao was not continued after his reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 597 601 602&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 597, 601–602.&lt;/ref&gt; As the economy worsened, Huan built new hunting parks, [[Chinese garden|imperial gardens]], palace buildings, and expanded his [[harem]] to house thousands of [[concubine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 599&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 599.&lt;/ref&gt; The gentry class became alienated by Huan's corrupt government dominated by eunuchs and many refused nominations to serve in office, since current Confucian beliefs dictated that morality and personal relationships superseded public service.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 601–602; Hansen (2000), 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Ling hosted much less concubines than Huan, yet Ling left much of the affairs of state to his eunuchs. Instead, Ling busied himself play-acting as a [[Peddler|traveling salesman]] with concubines dressed as [[Vendor (supply chain)|market vendors]] or dressing in military costume as the 'General Supreme' for his parading Army of the Western Garden.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 513 514&quot;/&gt;

===Foreign relations and war of middle Eastern Han===
[[File:Western Han incense burner.jpg|thumb|upright|A Western Han [[bronze]] [[censer|incense burner]] with [[gold]], [[silver]], [[turquoise]], and [[carnelian]] inlaid decoration]]

The Eastern-Han court colonized and periodically reasserted the Chinese military presence in the Western Regions only as a means to combat the Northern Xiongnu.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 421; Chang (2007), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Han forces were expelled from the Western Regions first by the Xiongnu between 77–90 CE and then by the Qiang between 107–122 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 421&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 421.&lt;/ref&gt; In both of these periods, the financial burdens of reestablishing and expanding western colonies, as well as the liability of sending financial aid requested by Tarim-Basin tributary states, were viewed by the court as reasons to forestall the reopening of foreign relations in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 421&quot;/&gt;

At the beginning of Empress Dowager Deng's regency, the Protector General of the Western Regions [[Ren Shang]] (d. 118 CE) was besieged at Kashgar. Although he was able to break the siege, he was recalled and replaced before the Empress Dowager began to withdraw forces from the Western Regions in 107 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 123&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a transitional force was still needed.

Their revolt in the northwestern [[Government of the Han dynasty#Provincial authorities|province]] of Liang (涼州) was put down in 108 CE, but it spurred a greater Qiang rebellion that would last until 118 CE, cutting off Han's access to Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 123–124; ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E8%B3%87%E6%B2%BB%E9%80%9A%E9%91%91/%E5%8D%B7049 vol. 49]; ''[[Book of Later Han]]'', [http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%BE%8C%E6%BC%A2%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B747 vol. 47], [http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%BE%8C%E6%BC%A2%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B787 vol. 87] ; see also Yü (1986), 429–430.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qiang problem was exacerbated in 109 CE by a combined Southern Xiongnu, [[Xianbei]], and Wuhuan rebellion in the northeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 123 124&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007) 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; The total monetary cost for putting down the Qiang rebellion in Liang province was 24 million cash (out of an average of 220 million cash minted annually), while the people of three entire commanderies within eastern Liang province and one commandery within Bing province were temporarily resettled in 110 CE.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 123–124; Yü (1986), 430–432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of perhaps greater consequence for the Han dynasty [[Northern Wei|and future dynasties]] was the ascendance of the [[Xianbei state|Xianbei people]]. They filled the vacuum of power on the vast northern steppe after the Northern Xiongnu were defeated by Han and fled to the [[Ili River]] valley (in modern [[Kazakhstan]]) in 91 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Yü (1986), 405 &amp; 443–444.&lt;/ref&gt; The Xianbei quickly occupied the deserted territories and incorporated some 100,000 remnant Xiongnu families into their new federation, which by the mid 2nd century CE stretched from the western borders of the [[Buyeo Kingdom]] in [[Jilin]], to the [[Dingling]] in southern [[Siberia]], and all the way west to the Ili River valley of the Wusun people.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 443 444&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 443–444.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they raided Han in 110 CE to force a negotiation of better trade agreements, the later leader Tanshihuai (檀石槐) (d. 180 CE) refused kingly titles and tributary arrangements offered by Emperor Huan and defeated Chinese armies under Emperor Ling.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 1986 444 445&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 444–445.&lt;/ref&gt; When Tanshihuai died in 180 CE, the Xianbei Federation largely fell apart, yet it grew powerful once more during the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;yü 445 446&quot;&gt;Yü (1986), 445–446.&lt;/ref&gt;

After being introduced in the 1st century CE, Buddhism became more popular in China during the 2nd century CE. The Parthian monk [[An Shigao]] traveled from [[Parthia]] to China in 148 CE and made translations of Buddhists works on the [[Hinayana]] and [[yoga]] practices which the Chinese associated with Daoist exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Demieville (1986), 823; Akira (1998), 248; Zhang (2002), 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kushan monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] from [[Gandhara]] was active in China from 178–198 CE, translated the ''[[Perfection of Wisdom]]'', ''[[Shurangama Sutra]]'', and ''[[Pratyutpanna Sutra]]'', and introduced to China the concepts of [[Akshobhya]] Buddha, [[Amitābha]] Buddha (of [[Pure Land Buddhism]]), and teachings about [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;akira 1998 248 251&quot;&gt;Akira (1998), 248 &amp; 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In 166 CE, Emperor Huan made sacrifices to Laozi and [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;demieville 1986 825 826&quot;&gt;Demieville (1986), 825–826.&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' records that [[Chronology of European exploration of Asia|Romans reached China]] from [[Roman trade with India|the maritime south]] and presented gifts to Huan's court, claiming they represented Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus]] (''Andun'' 安敦) (r. 161–180 CE).&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 600; Yü (1986), 460–461.&lt;/ref&gt; Crespigny speculates that they were [[Roman commerce|Roman merchants]], not diplomats.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 600&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 600.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological findings at [[Óc Eo]] (near [[Ho Chi Minh City]]) in the [[Mekong Delta]], which was once part of the [[Kingdom of Funan]] bordering the Chinese province of [[Jiaozhi]] (in northern [[Vietnam]]), have revealed Mediterranean goods such as Roman [[gold medal]]lions made [[Antonine|during the reigns]] of [[Antoninus Pius]] and Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref&gt;Young (2001), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Óc Eo may have been the same Southeast Asian seaport city mentioned in the 2nd-century ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' by the Greco-Roman writer [[Ptolemy]] (as well as in the work of [[Marinus of Tyre]]), a city called [[Cattigara]] where a Greek sailor named Alexandros allegedly visited by sailing northeast of the [[Golden Peninsula]] (i.e. the [[Malay Peninsula]]) into the ''[[Magnus Sinus]]'' (i.e. [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[South China Sea]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mawer (2013), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly (2007), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suárez (1999), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2016), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partisan Prohibitions===
In 166 CE, the official Li Ying (李膺) was accused by palace eunuchs of plotting treason with students at the Imperial University and associates in the provinces who opposed the eunuchs.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 602&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 602.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Huan was furious, arresting Li and his followers, who were only released from prison the following year due to pleas from the General-in-Chief [[Dou Wu]] (d. 168 CE) (Emperor Huan's father-in-law).&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 602&quot;/&gt; However, Li Ying and hundreds of his followers were proscribed from holding any offices and were branded as [[Partisan (political)|partisan]]s (黨人).&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 602&quot;/&gt;

After Emperor Huan's death, at the urging of the Grand Tutor (太傅) Chen Fan (陳蕃) (d. 168 CE), Dou Wu presented a [[Chinese memorial|memorial to the court]] in June 168 CE denouncing the leading eunuchs as corrupt and calling for their execution, but Empress Dowager Dou refused the proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 319 320&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 319–320.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a memorial presented by Chen Fan calling for the heads of [[Hou Lan]] (d. 172 CE) and [[Cao Jie (eunuch)|Cao Jie]] (d. 181 CE), and when this too was refused Dou Wu took formal legal action which could not be ignored by the court.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 320 321&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 320–321.&lt;/ref&gt; When Shan Bing, a eunuch associate of Chen and Dou's, gained a forced confession from another eunuch that Cao Jie and Wang Fu (王甫) plotted treason, he prepared another damning written memorial on the night of October 24–25 which the opposing eunuchs secretly opened and read.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 320 321&quot;/&gt; Cao Jie armed Emperor Ling with a sword and hid him with his [[wet nurse]], while Wang Fu had Shan Bing killed and Empress Dowager Dou incarcerated so that the eunuchs could use the authority [[Seal (East Asia)|of her seal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 321 322&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pottery tower 6.JPG|thumb|left|A Han dynasty pottery model of two residential towers joined by a [[covered bridge]]]]
Chen Fan entered the palace with eighty followers and engaged in a shouting match with Wang Fu, yet Chen was gradually surrounded, detained, and later trampled to death in prison that day (his followers were unharmed).&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 322&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 322.&lt;/ref&gt; At dawn, the general Zhang Huan (張奐), misled by the eunuchs into believing that Dou Wu was committing treason, engaged in a shouting match with Dou Wu at the palace gates, but as Dou's followers slowly deserted him and trickled over to Zhang's side, Dou was forced to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1986), 322; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷056|vol. 56]].&lt;/ref&gt; In neither of these confrontations did any actual physical fighting break out.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 322&quot;/&gt;

With Dou Wu eliminated and the Empress Dowager under house arrest, the eunuchs renewed the proscriptions against Li Ying and his followers; in 169 CE they had hundreds more officials and students prohibited from serving office, sent their families into exile, and had Li Ying executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 511&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 511.&lt;/ref&gt; The eunuchs barred potential enemies from court, sold and bartered offices, and infiltrated the military command.&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1986), 323; Hinsch (2002), 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Ling even referred to eunuchs [[Zhao Zhong]] and [[Zhang Rang]] as his &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;father&quot;; the latter two had so much influence over the emperor that they convinced him not to ascend to the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty#Structural engineering and public works|top floors of tall towers]] in the capital, which was an effort to conceal from him the enormous mansions that the eunuchs built for themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 513 514&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 513–514.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the partisan prohibitions were extended to hundreds more in 176 CE (including the distant relatives of those earlier proscribed), they were abolished in 184 CE with the outbreak of the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], largely because the court feared the gentry—bitter from their banishment from office—would join the rebel cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 511&quot;/&gt;

===Yellow Turban Rebellion===
{{further information|Society and culture of the Han dynasty}}
[[File:Eastern Han stone guardian, Donghan, Xuchang.JPG|thumb|right|An Eastern Han feline stone guardian statue from Donghan, [[Xuchang]]]]

In 142 CE, [[Zhang Daoling]] founded the [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice|Five Pecks of Rice]] religious society in [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 2000 144 145&quot;&gt;Hansen (2000), 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; After claiming to have seen the deified Laozi as a holy [[prophet]] who appointed him as his earthly representative known as the Celestial Master, Zhang created a highly organized, hierarchical Daoist movement which accepted only [[peck]]s of rice and no money from its lay followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 2000 144 145&quot;/&gt; In 184 CE, the Five Pecks of Rice under [[Zhang Lu (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Lu]] staged a rebellion in Sichuan and set up a [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice|theocratic Daoist state]] that endured until 215 CE.&lt;ref name=Hend140-141&gt;Hendrischke (2000), 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Five Pecks of Rice, the Yellow Turban Daoists of the Yellow and Huai River regions also built a hierarchical church and believed that illness was the result of personal [[sin]]s needing [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 2000 144 145&quot;/&gt; The Yellow Turbans became a militant organization that challenged Han authority by claiming they would bring about a [[utopia]]n era of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 2000 145 146&quot;&gt;Hansen (2000), 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Jue]], renowned [[Faith healing|faith-healer]] and leader of the Yellow Turbans, and his hundreds of thousands of followers, designated by the yellow cloth that they wrapped around their foreheads, led a rebellion across eight provinces in 184 CE. They had early successes against imperial troops but by the end of 184 CE the Yellow Turban leadership—including Zhang—had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (2000), 145–146; de Crespigny (2007), 514–515; Beck (1986), 339–340.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller groups of Yellow Turbans continued to revolt in the following years (until the last large group was incorporated into the forces of Chancellor Cao Cao in 192 CE), yet Crespigny asserts that the rebellion's impact on the fall of Han was less consequential than events which transpired in the capital following the death of Emperor Ling on May 13, 189 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 515&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 515.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Patricia Ebrey points out that many of the generals who raised armies to quell the rebellion never disbanded their forces and used them to amass their own power outside of imperial authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 1999 84&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1999), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall of the eunuchs===
[[File:Eastern Han pottery chandelier.JPG|thumb|right|An Eastern-Han ceramic [[candle]]-holder with prancing animal figures]]

[[He Jin]] (d. 189 CE), half-brother to [[Empress He (Han dynasty)|Empress He]] (d. 189 CE), was given authority over the [[standing army]] and palace guards when appointed as General-in-Chief during the Yellow Turban Rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1986), 339; Huang (1988), 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Empress He's son Liu Bian, known later as [[Prince of Hongnong|Emperor Shao of Han]], was put on the throne, the eunuch Jian Shi plotted against He Jin, was discovered, and executed on May 27, 189 CE; He Jin thus took over Jian's Army of the Western Garden.&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1986), 341–342.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yuan Shao]] (d. 202 CE), then an officer in the Army of the Western Garden, plotted with He Jin to overthrow the eunuchs by secretly ordering several generals to march towards the capital and forcefully persuade the Empress Dowager He to hand over the eunuchs.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 343&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Yuan had these generals send in [[memorial to the throne|petition]] after petition to the Empress Dowager calling for the eunuchs' dismissal; Mansvelt Beck states that this &quot;psychological war&quot; finally broke the Empress Dowager's will and she consented.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 344&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 344.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the eunuchs discovered this and used Empress Dowager He's mother Lady Wuyang and her brother He Miao (何苗), both of whom were sympathetic to the eunuchs, to have the order rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1986), 344; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷059|vol. 59]].&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, the eunuchs learned that He Jin had a private conversation with the Empress Dowager about executing them. They sent message to He Jin that the Empress Dowager had more words to share with him; once he sat down in the hall to meet her, eunuchs rushed out of hiding and beheaded He Jin. When the eunuchs ordered the imperial secretaries to draft an edict dismissing Yuan Shao, the former asked for He Jin's permission, so the eunuchs showed them He Jin's severed head.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 344&quot;/&gt;

However, the eunuchs became besieged when Yuan Shao attacked the Northern Palace and his brother [[Yuan Shu]] (d. 199 CE) attacked the Southern Palace, breaching the gate and forcing the eunuchs to flee to the Northern Palace by the covered passageway connecting both.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 345&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao Zhong was killed on the first day and the fighting lasted until September 25 when Yuan Shao finally broke into the Northern Palace and purportedly slaughtered two thousand eunuchs.&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1986), 345; Hansen (2000), 147; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Zhang Rang managed to flee with Emperor Shao and his brother [[Emperor Xian of Han|Liu Xie]] to the Yellow River, where he was chased down by the Yuan family troops and committed suicide by jumping into the river and drowning.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 345&quot;/&gt;

===Coalition against Dong Zhuo===

[[Dong Zhuo]] (d. 192 CE), General of the Van (under [[Huangfu Song]]) who marched on to Luoyang under Yuan Shao's request, saw the capital in flames from a distance and heard that Emperor Shao was wandering in the hills nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 345 346&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 345–346.&lt;/ref&gt; When Dong approached Emperor Shao, the latter became frightened and unresponsive yet his brother Liu Xie explained to Dong what had happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 345 346&quot;/&gt; The ambitious Dong took over effective control of Luoyang and forced Yuan Shao to flee the capital on September 26.

Yuan Shao, once he left the capital, led a coalition of commanders, former officials, and soldiers of fortune to challenge Dong Zhuo.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 347&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 347.&lt;/ref&gt; No longer viewing Luoyang as a safehaven, Dong burned the city to the ground and forced the imperial court to resettle at Chang'an in May 191 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 347 349&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 347–349.&lt;/ref&gt; In a conspiracy headed by the [[Minister over the Masses]], [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]] (d. 192 CE), Dong was killed by his adopted son [[Lü Bu]] (d. 198 CE).&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 158&quot;&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Dong's subordinates then killed Wang and forced Lü to flee, throwing Chang'an into chaos.&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷060|vol. 60]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When there was speculation that [[Liu Bei]] (161–223 CE), a scion of the imperial family who was formerly in the service of Cao Cao, was planning to take over the territory of the now ill Liu Biao in 208 CE, Cao Cao forced Liu Biao's son to surrender his father's land.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 352&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 352.&lt;/ref&gt; Expecting Cao Cao to turn on him next, [[Sun Quan]] (182–252 CE), who inherited the territory of his brother Sun Ce in 200 CE, allied with Liu Bei and faced Cao Cao's naval force in 208 CE at the [[Battle of Chibi]]. This was a significant defeat for Cao Cao which ensured the continued disunity of China during the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220–265 CE).&lt;ref name=&quot;de crespigny 2007 37 beck 1986 352&quot;/&gt;

When Cao Cao moved Emperor Xian to Xuchang in 196 CE, he took the title of Excellency of Works as Dong Zhuo had before him.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 353 354&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 353–354.&lt;/ref&gt; In 208 CE, Cao abolished the three most senior offices, the Three Excellencies, and instead recreated two offices, the Imperial Counselor and Chancellor; he occupied the latter post.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 352 353&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 352–353.&lt;/ref&gt; Cao was enfeoffed as the Duke of Wei in 213 CE, had Emperor Xian divorce [[Empress Fu Shou]] in 214 CE, and then had him marry his daughter as [[Empress Cao Jie]] in 215 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 354 355&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 354–355.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Cao took the title King of Wei in 216 CE, violating the rule that only Liu family members could become kings, yet he never deposed Emperor Xian.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 354 355&quot;/&gt; After Cao Cao died in 220 CE, his son [[Cao Pi]] (186–226 CE) inherited the title King of Wei and gained the uneasy allegiance of Sun Quan (while Liu Bei at this point had taken over Liu Zhang's territory of Yi Province).&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 355 356&quot;&gt;Beck (1986), 355–366.&lt;/ref&gt; With debates over prognostication and signs from heaven showing the Han had lost the [[Mandate of Heaven]], Emperor Xian agreed that the Han dynasty had reached its end and abdicated to Cao Pi on December 11, 220 CE, thus creating the state of [[Cao Wei]], soon to oppose [[Shu Han]] in 221 CE and [[Eastern Wu]] in 229 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1986), 356–357; Hinsch (2002), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
