'''''Rusalka''''' ({{lang-ru| '''Русалка'''}}, ''Mermaid''), was one of two {{sclass-|Charodeika|monitor|3|warship}}s built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the 1860s. She served for her entire career with the [[Baltic Fleet]]. Aside from hitting an uncharted rock not long after she was completed in 1869, she had an uneventful career. ''Rusalka'' sank in a storm in 1893 with the loss of all hands in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. A memorial was built in [[Reval]] (modern Tallinn) to commemorate her loss almost a decade later. Her wreck was rediscovered in 2003, bow-down in the mud, which has prompted a new theory regarding her loss.

==Design and description==
''Rusalka'' was {{convert|206|ft|m|1}} long at the [[waterline]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|42|ft|m|1}} and a maximum [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|7|in|m|1}}. The ship was designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|1882|LT|t}}, but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced {{convert|2100|LT|t}}. Her crew numbered 13 officers and 171 crewmen in 1877.&lt;ref name=m6&gt;McLaughlin, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship had two simple horizontal [[Marine steam engine#Direct acting|direct-acting steam engines]], each driving a single propeller. The engines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|900|ihp|lk=in}} using steam provided by two coal-fired rectangular [[fire-tube boiler]]s, but only achieved {{convert|705|ihp|abbr=on}} and a speed of approximately {{convert|9|kn|lk=in}} during her [[sea trial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 156, 159–60&lt;/ref&gt; She carried a maximum of {{convert|250|LT|t|0}} of coal for her boilers.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rusalka'' was initially armed with a pair of {{convert|9|in|adj=on|0|spell=in}} [[rifling|rifled]] Model 1867 guns in the forward gun turret and a pair of {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0|spell=in}} [[smoothbore]] [[Rodman gun]]s in the aft turret. The Rodman guns were replaced by a pair of [[Obukhov State Plant|Obukhov]] {{convert|9|in|0|adj=on}} rifled guns in 1871 and all of the nine-inch guns were replaced in their turn by longer, more powerful nine-inch Obukhov guns in 1878–79. No light guns for use against [[torpedo boat]]s are known to have been fitted aboard the ship before the 1870s when she received 3 four-pounder {{convert|3.4|in|adj=on}} guns mounted on the turret tops as well as a variety of smaller guns that included {{convert|45|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} Engström [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) gun]]s, {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Nordenfelt gun]]s, single-barreled QF {{convert|47|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s and QF {{convert|37|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} Hotchkiss revolving cannon.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship had a complete waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[wrought iron]] that was {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick amidships and thinned to {{convert|3.75|in|mm|0}} at the bow and {{convert|3.25|in|mm}} at the stern. The armor was backed by {{convert|12|to|18|in|mm}} of [[teak]]. The circular turrets were protected by armor {{convert|5.5|in|mm}} thick and the walls of the ship's oval [[conning tower]] were also 4.5 inches thick. Her [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|1|in|mm}} thick [[amidships]], but reduced to {{convert|0.25|-|0.5|in|mm}} at the ends of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 158–59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and service==
''Rusalka'', named after [[Rusalka|the mythological creature]],&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; was ordered on 25 January 1865 and construction began on 10 June at the [[Admiralty Shipyard]], [[Saint Petersburg]], although the formal [[keel]]-laying was not until 6 June 1866. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 September 1867 and completed in 1869 at the cost of 762,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]]. Construction was considerably delayed by late deliveries of drawings, material, and the death of her original builder. The ship struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast in June 1869 and damaged her bottom plating badly enough that she had to be [[Ship grounding|run aground]] to prevent her from sinking. ''Rusalka'' served her entire career with the Baltic Fleet and was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870. The ship had her boilers replaced in 1878 and 1891 and she was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 152, 155–56, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinking===
''Rusalka'', under the command of [[Commander|Captain 2nd Rank]] V. Kh. Ienish sailed from Reval harbor at 08:30 on 7 September 1893, bound for Helsingfors ([[Helsinki]]). She was escorted by the [[gunboat]] ''Tucha'' ({{lang-ru| ''Туча''}}, ''Cloud'') under Captain 2nd Rank N. M. Lushkov. Several hours after their departure the weather deteriorated into a storm, with [[gale force]] winds and rain; ''Tucha'' lost her charge from sight around noon, but sailed on and arrived safely at Helsingfors.&lt;ref name=m0&gt;McLaughlin, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

No trace of the monitor was found until the corpse of a sailor in a [[dinghy]] and a few [[lifebuoy]]s washed ashore on the Finnish island of Kremare.&lt;ref name=m62&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 160–62&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive searches of the sea bottom also failed to locate the ship. In January 1894 a commission appointed to investigate convened and reprimanded [[Rear Admiral]] P. S. Burachek, commander of the detachment, for letting ''Rusalka'' go to sea in bad weather as well as Lushkov for losing contact with the monitor. The commission concluded that the ship's steering gear failed or that water had entered the ship and caused her to lose power. Either would have caused ''Rusalka'' to turn parallel to the waves where her superstructure would have been demolished and extensive flooding would have soon overwhelmed her small reserve of buoyancy.&lt;ref name=m62/&gt; Whatever the cause, ''Rusalka'' obviously [[Broach (sailing)|broached]] and sank with the loss of all 177 members of her crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Delgado&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0809/abstracts/mermaid.html|title=The Wreck of the Mermaid|work=[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monument===

{{main|Russalka Memorial}}
On 7 September 1902, the ninth anniversary of the loss of the ship, a monument to ''Rusalka'' was erected in Tallinn. Sculpted by [[Amandus Adamson]], it takes the form of a bronze angel standing on a granite pedestal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.postimees.ee/200705/esileht/siseuudised/tallinn/171806.php|title=Soomuslaev sai mälestusmärgi üheksa aastat pärast hukku|date=20 July 2005|work=[[Postimees]]|language=Estonian|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
The wreck of ''Rusalka'' was claimed to have been found by divers of the Soviet [[EPRON]] salvage agency in 1932, but they made no attempt to salvage it. EPRON's location does not match that of the ship as discovered in 2003.&lt;ref name=m62&gt;McLaughlin, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2003, a joint project was launched by the [[Estonian Maritime Museum]] and the commercial diving company ''Tuukritööde OÜ'' with the aim of finding ''Rusalka'' which had sunk 110 years earlier. On 22 July 2003 the wreck of ''Rusalka'' was located in the Gulf of Finland, {{convert|25|km|sp=us}} south of Helsinki, by the museum's research vessel ''Mare''.&lt;ref name=mare&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuuker.ee/en/varia/|title=Varia|publisher=Tuukritööde OÜ|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, deep divers Kaido Peremees and Indrek Ostrat more precisely located and videoed the wreck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Delgado&quot;/&gt; Most unusually, the wreck is in a near-vertical position; following her sinking, the vessel plunged, bow first, {{convert|74|m|sp=us}} directly downward into the muddy bottom of the gulf, and is buried in the bottom to almost half her length.&lt;ref name=&quot;mare&quot;/&gt; The divers found the stern of the lost vessel rising {{convert|33|m|sp=us}} above the sea bed and her rudder turned to starboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Delgado&quot;/&gt;

The wreck is generally intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out off the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=DkC396nHo6E#!|title=Dive The Wreck Of The Russalka In The Baltic|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vertical position of the wreck has inspired a new theory of her loss by nautical [[archaeologist]] Vello Mäss. He believes that ''Rusalka'' was taking on water forward, perhaps from a leak or through ventilation hatches and was bow-heavy when her captain decided to make a turn, possibly to return to Reval, and the ship [[capsized]] during the turn with her engines still running. Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom.&lt;ref name=&quot;m62&quot;/&gt;
