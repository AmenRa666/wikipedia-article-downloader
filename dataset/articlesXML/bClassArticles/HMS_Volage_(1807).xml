'''HMS ''Volage''''' was a [[Laurel class post ship|''Laurel''-class]] [[sixth-rate]] [[post-ship]] of the [[Royal Navy]].  She served during the [[Napoleonic War]], capturing four privateers and participating in the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)]]. She was sold in 1818. She then served in a commercial capacity for another 12 years, sailing to India and the South Seas. She is last listed in ''Lloyd's List'' in 1831.

==Career==

The ''Volage'' was built by Richard Chapman, of [[Bideford]], and was launched on 23 March 1807.&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), p.237.&lt;/ref&gt; She was sent to the [[Mediterranean]] in October 1807, soon after commissioning in May 1807 under Captain Philip Rosenhagen.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; On 6 November she was off [[Galite Islands|Galita Island]] when she captured the French cutter ''Succès'', of ten guns and 59 men, under the command of ''Lieutenant de Vaisseau'' Bourdé Villehuet. According to her captain, ''Succès'' had sailed from Toulon three days earlier on a cruise; Rosenhagen suspected that she was actually carrying despatches that Villehuet had had time to destroy. Rosenhagen also thought that ''Succès'' may have been in British service as the ''Sussex''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=142 |issue=16113|date=26 January 1808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;There is no record of a cutter, whether commissioned or a [[hired armed vessels|hired armed vessel]], by that name. If she had been a cutter in &quot;His Majesty's Service&quot;, she may have been a revenue vessel.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in May, {{HMS|Wizard|1805|2}} had chased and engaged ''Requin'' for some 88 hours and 369 miles before having to give up the chase when ''Requin'' was able to gain the protection of the guns of Fort Goleta in Tunis Bay.

The next year, on 28 July 1808, ''Volage'' captured the French brig [[French brig Requin (1806)|''Requin'']] just north of Corsica after a chase of nine hours during which ''Requin'' threw her boats, boom, and anchors overboard. ''Requin'' was only 14 months old, armed with 16 guns, though pierced for 18, and had a crew of 108 men under the command of ''Capitaine-de-Fregate'' Bérar, a Member of the [[Legion of Honour]]. She had just left Ajaccio where she had delivered prizes that she had taken on her way from Algiers to Toulon. Rosenhagen took his prisoners into Malta before returning to his station.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1438|issue=16194|date=22 October 1808}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French account reports that ''Requin'' endured two-and-a-half hours of fire, returning three broadsides, before surrendering to the English frigate ''Volage'', of 40 guns.&lt;ref&gt;Troude (1867), Vol. 3, p.509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, in May, {{HMS|Wizard|1805|2}} had chased and engaged ''Requin'' for some 88 hours and 369 miles before having to give up the chase when ''Requin'' was able to gain the protection of the guns of Fort Goleta in the bay of Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;James (1837), Vol. 4, pp.293-298.&lt;/ref&gt; The British took ''Requin'' into service as HMS ''Sabine''.

Almost a year later, ''Volage'' captured two more privateers. On 6 September 1809 she captured the ''Annunciate'', of two guns and 40 men. Then on 20 September, ''Volage'' captured the ''Jason'', of six guns and 69 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1932|issue=16321|date=2 December 1809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1810, boats from ''Volage'' and from {{HMS|Bustard|1806|2}}, under the command of Captain John Duff Markland of ''Bustard'',  entered a port a few miles south of [[Crotone|Cortone]]. There they destroyed 25 vessels carrying stores and provisions for [[Joachim Murat]]'s army in Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Brenton (1837), p.357.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810 Captain [[Phipps Hornby]] took command and she served in the [[Adriatic]],&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; fighting at the Battle of Lissa and driving off a much larger French ship during the action. The action cost ''Volage'' 13 men killed and 33 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=892|endpage=896|issue=16485|date=14 May 1811}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Volage'' was badly cut-up in the battle. On 2 June she sailed from Malta for England in company with {{HMS|Amphion|1798|2}} and the prizes from the battle. She carried with her [[Lord Byron]] as a passenger.&lt;ref&gt;Byron (1854), p.765.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Battle of Lissa (1811)}}

In 1831, HMS Volage was docked in Rio de Janeiro (at the time capital of the Empire of Brazil) alongside HMS Warspite. Volage was the vessel that took Dom Pedro I, who had just abdicated the Brazilian throne, to Portugal, in order to face his brother Dom Miguel in the context of the ongoing Portuguese Civil War of 1828-1834.

In 1847 the Admiralty awarded all surviving claimants from the action the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Lissa&quot;.

Following this victory, ''Volage'' came briefly under the command of Arthur Bingham in February 1812, or so. She then was sent to the East Indies under Captain [[Donald Mackay (Royal Navy officer)|Donald Hugh Mackay]].&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; She was carrying Sir [[Evan Nepean]], who was taking up his post as governor in Bombay, and escorting three [[cartel (ship)|cartel ships]]. On the way she arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 24 June.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 28, p.249.&lt;/ref&gt; She then served under the orders of [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Sir Samuel Hood]] in the Eastern Archipelago and the China seas.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1827), Supplement - Part 1, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1813, ''Volage'' was under the command of Captain Samuel Leslie when her sailors took part in the capture of the pirate settlement at [[Sultanate of Sambas|Sambas]], in Borneo. There they helped capture five batteries, one after another, in half an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, pp.329-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Then in September ''Volage'' participated  in the operations in support of the restoration of the Sultan of [[Palembang]]. Leslie left ''Volage'' on 1 January 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, pp.91-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Then for while she came under the command of her [[first lieutenant]] (acting captain) John Allen.&lt;ref&gt;O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March ''Volage'' next came under the command of Captain Joseph Drury, followed by Captain Charles Biddulph in April. However he died in April 1815.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; In February 1816 she came under the command of Captain Johnathan Bartholomew Hoar Curran, who sailed her back to Britain.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==Fate==
''Volage'' was sold on 29 January 1818 for £1,600 to a Mr. Lackland for mercantile use. She then assumed the name ''Rochester''.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==Commercial service==

''Lloyd's Register'' for 1819 shows a ''Rochester'', &quot;Bdefrd&quot;-built, 10 years old, and 530 tons (bm). This vessel continues in commercial service for a number of years. The last year for this vessel is 1831.
