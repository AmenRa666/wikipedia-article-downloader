[[United States Army Indian Scouts]] served with troops from Fort Walla Walla until at least 1893.  Indian Scouts saved the lives of many of Lt Col Steptoe's personnel during the Battle of Pine Creek.  Most scouts came from the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce tribe]].

==Military action taken from Fort Walla Walla==
In May 1858, the [[Battle of Pine Creek]] took place, when Lt Col. Steptoe lead troops north to investigate the reported murder of miners and was forced to retreat after being attacked by a mixed force of [[Spokane people|Spokane]], [[Palus people|Palouse]], and [[Coeur d'Alene people|Coeur d'Alene]] Indians near present Rosalia, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Converse, George L., 1988, ''A Military History of the Columbia Valley 1848-1865, pps 45-47, Walla Walla, Washington, Pioneer Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1858, the [[Battle of Four Lakes]] took place when [[Colonel]] [[George Wright (general)|George Wright]] lead units of the 9th Infantry, 3rd [[Artillery]], and 1st Dragoons in a punitive action after the loss during the Battle of Pine Creek.  The force met up with a large force of Indians in the area between present [[Cheney, Washington|Cheney]] and [[Medical Lake, Washington|Medical Lake]].  Near [[Liberty Lake, Washington|Liberty Lake]], Colonel Wright's troops captured 800 Indian [[horse]]s, the principal wealth for the tribes, and slaughtered them leading to the cessation of all hostilities by the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Converse, George L., 1988, ''A Military History of the Columbia Valley 1848-1865, pps 47-51, Walla Walla, Washington, Pioneer Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 1877, soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Regiment were involved in the [[Battle of White Bird Canyon]] during the Nez Perce War. More than 30 U. S. soldiers died during the battle.  A monument to those killed is at the Fort Walla Walla Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne 2011, p. 19&quot;&gt;Payne, James and Schultz, Laura, 2011, ''An Illustrated History of Fort Walla Walla'', Walla Walla, Washington, Fort Walla Walla Museum, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Between July 3 and 5, 1877, members of E and L Companies of the 1st Cavalry engaged the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]] Indians at the [[Battle of Cottonwood]] with a loss of ten soldiers.  Their remains are also buried in the Fort Walla Walla Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne 2011, p. 19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interment.net/data/us/wa/wallawalla/ftwalla/fort_walla.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roads connecting with Fort Walla Walla==

Naches Pass road, between Fort Walla Walla and [[Fort Steilacoom]], was built in 1853 by local residents after waiting for [[Lieutenant]] [[George B. McClellan]] to construct the route. It proved difficult to use with some very steep descents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=10781 HistoryLink article Congress funds construction of military road between Fort Walla Walla and Steilacoom on December 29, 1852]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fort Walla Walla Fort Colville Military Road was built on the long established native trail and fur trader's route between Walla Walla and [[Kettle Falls, Washington|Kettle Falls]] and the Hudson Bay Company's [[Fort Colville]].  [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Pinkney Lugenbeel]] and his soldiers improved the road to support wagons in June 1859 on their way to build [[Fort Colville (US Army)|U. S. Fort Colville]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevens County Historical Society, The Fort Walla Walla Fort Colville Military Road Project, Colville, Washington, September 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1859,  US Army [[Lieutenant]] [[John Mullan]] followed the Fort Walla Walla Fort Colville Military Road until just north of [[Benge, Washington]] and then built the 600-mile [[Mullan Road]] from Fort Walla Walla to [[Fort Benton, Montana]] through the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=5225 History Link article Lt. John Mullan and a 230-man crew begin building Mullan's Road (Mullan Road) from Walla Walla in spring 1859]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort Walla Walla Museum==
The Fort Walla Walla Museum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortwallawallamuseum.org/ Fort Walla Walla Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; comprises 15 acres of the Fort Walla Walla Park, and includes four exhibit halls and a 17-building pioneer village.  The museum offers [[living history]] performances each season on weekends and children's programs.

The pioneer village includes several [[Log cabin|cabins]], an [[outhouse]], [[Horse harness|harness]] shop, [[blacksmith]] shop, [[school]]s, a [[Prison|jail]], [[train depot]], [[doctor's office]] and other structures.

The exhibit halls include displays of military weapons and artifacts, tools, agricultural equipment, antique vehicles and firefighting vehicles, clothing and textiles.
