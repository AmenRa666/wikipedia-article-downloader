'''HMS ''Indefatigable''''' was an {{sclass-|Implacable|aircraft carrier}} built for the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) during World War II. She was completed in 1944, and her aircraft made several attacks that year against the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}}, inflicting only light damage; they also raided targets in Norway. The ship was transferred to the [[British Pacific Fleet]] (BPF) at the end of the year and attacked Japanese-controlled [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] in Sumatra in January 1945 before joining the American forces in March as they prepared to invade the island of [[Okinawa]] in [[Operation Iceberg]]. ''Indefatigable'' and the BPF joined the Americans in attacking the [[Japanese Home Islands]] in July and August. Following the end of hostilities she visited ports in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

After returning to the UK in early 1946, ''Indefatigable'' was modified for transport duties, and ferried troops and civilians for the rest of the year before she was reduced to [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. She was recommissioned in 1950 as a training ship for service with the [[Home Fleet]] Training Squadron, participating in exercises and making several port visits overseas. The [[Board of Admiralty]] decided that she was redundant in early 1954 and decommissioned her later that year. ''Indefatigable'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] the following year.

==Design and description==
The ''Implacable'' class were ordered under the 1938 Naval Programme by the [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] government as part of the general rearmament begun in response to the rise of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922–43)|Fascist Italy]]. The design originated as an improved version of the {{sclass-|Illustrious|aircraft carrier}}s and was intended to be {{convert|2|kn|lk=in}} faster and carry an additional dozen aircraft over the {{convert|30|kn|adj=on}} speed and 36 aircraft of the earlier ships. To remain within the {{convert|23000|LT|t}} limit allowed by the [[Second London Naval Treaty]], these improvements could only be made by reducing armour protection.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indefatigable'' was {{convert|766|ft|6|in|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]] and {{convert|730|ft|m|1}} at the [[waterline]]. Her [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was {{convert|95|ft|9|in|m|1}} at the waterline,&lt;ref name=f6&gt;Friedman, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; and she had a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|29|ft|4|in|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. The ''Implacable''-class ships were significantly overweight and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|32110|LT|t}} at deep load.&lt;ref name=b9&gt;Brown, David, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The ships had [[metacentric height]]s of {{convert|4.06|ft|m|1}} at light load and {{convert|6.91|ft|m|1}} at deep load as completed.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s complement was approximately 2,300 officers and enlisted men in 1945.&lt;ref name=h9&gt;Hobbs 2013, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships had four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one shaft, using steam supplied by eight [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=c0&gt;Chesneau 1980, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|148000|shp|kW|abbr=on|lk=in}}, enough to give the ''Indefatigable''-class ships a maximum speed of {{convert|32.5|kn}}.&lt;ref name=f7&gt;Friedman, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; On [[sea trial]]s, ''Indefatigable'' reached speeds of {{convert|32.06|kn}} with {{convert|150935|shp|abbr=on}}. She carried a maximum of {{convert|4810|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] which gave her a range of {{convert|6900|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|20|kn}}.&lt;ref name=b9/&gt;

The {{convert|760|ft|m|adj=on|1}} armoured flight deck had a maximum width of {{convert|102|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; A single hydraulic [[aircraft catapult]] was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck. The ''Implacable''-class carriers were equipped with two [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|lifts]] on the centreline, the forward of which measured {{convert|45|by|33|ft|m|1}} and served only the upper hangar, and the aft lift ({{convert|45|by|22|ft|m|1}}), which served both hangars. The upper hangar was {{convert|458|ft|m|1}} long and the lower hangar was {{convert|208|ft|m|1}} long; both had a maximum width of {{convert|62|ft|m|1}}. Each hangar had a height of only 14 feet which precluded storage of [[Lend-Lease]] [[Vought F4U Corsair]] fighters as well as many post-war aircraft and [[helicopter]]s. Designed to stow 48 aircraft in their hangars, the use of a permanent deck park allowed the ''Implacable'' class to accommodate up to 81 aircraft. The additional crewmen, maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these aircraft were housed in the lower hangar. The ships were provided with {{convert|94650|impgal|l usgal}} of [[avgas|aviation gasoline]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1977, pp. 48–49; Friedman, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament, electronics and protection===
[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A21197.jpg|thumb|left|Water-level view of ''Indefatigable'' at anchor]]
The ship's main armament consisted of sixteen [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 4.5-inch Mk I – V naval gun|{{convert|4.5|in|mm|adj=on|0}}]] [[dual-purpose gun]]s in eight twin-[[gun turret]]s, four in [[sponson]]s on each side of the hull. Unlike the ''Illustrious''-class ships, the roofs of the gun turrets were flat and flush with the flight deck. The gun had a maximum range of {{convert|20760|yd|m}}.&lt;ref name=h9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 52, 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s light anti-aircraft defences included five octuple mounts for [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder (&quot;pom-pom&quot;)]] [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]], two on the flight deck forward of the island, one on the aft part of the island, and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull. A single quadruple 2-pounder mount was also fitted on the port side of the hull.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 144, 367&lt;/ref&gt; The 2-pounder gun had a maximum range of {{convert|6800|yd|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was also fitted with 55 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm]] [[autocannon]] in 17 single and 19 twin-gun mounts.&lt;ref name=b9/&gt; These guns had a maximum range of {{convert|4800|yd}}, but some were replaced by [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40 mm Bofors]] AA guns when the ships were transferred to the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre]] as the {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} shell was unlikely to destroy a [[kamikaze]] before it hit the ship. The [[Bofors]] gun had a maximum range of {{convert|10750|yd|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 67, 75&lt;/ref&gt; By August 1945, ''Indefatigable'' had 10 single Bofors guns, plus 14 twin and 12 single Oerlikon mounts. By April 1946 these had been reduced to 11 Bofors guns, 6 twin and 7 single Oerlikon guns.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 149, 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The specifics of the ''Implacable''-class ships' radar suite are not readily available. They were fitted with the [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 277|Type 277]] surface-search/[[Height finder|height-finding radar]] on top of the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 293|Type 293]] target indicator radar on the [[foremast]]. {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}}, one of the ''Illustrious''-class ships upon which ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s design was based, also carried Type 279 and [[Type 281 radar|Type 281]]B [[early-warning radar]]s. [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 282|Type 282]] and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the [[Ship gun fire-control system|fire-control directors]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 15–16, 18–19; Friedman, pp. 144–45, 149, 151; Hobbs 2013, pp. 111, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Implacable''-class ships had a flight deck protected by {{convert|3|in|0}} of armour.&lt;ref name=h9/&gt; The sides of the hangars were either {{convert|1.5|in}} or {{convert|2|in|0}}.{{refn|Sources disagree about the thickness of this armour. Historians [[David K. Brown]], [[Henry Trevor Lenton|H. T. Lenton]], and [[Norman Friedman]] believe that it was probably only 1.5 inches thick,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David K., pg. 51, fn. 45; Friedman, p. 143; Lenton, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; but other sources give 2 inches.&lt;ref name=h9/&gt;&lt;ref name=c0/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau 1995, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} The ends of the hangars were protected by 2-inch bulkheads&lt;ref name=h9/&gt; and the armour of the hangar deck ranged from {{convert|1.5|to|2.5|in}} in thickness. The waterline [[Belt armor|armour belt]] was {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick, but only covered the central portion of the ship. The belt was closed by 1.5 to 2-inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft. The [[torpedo belt|underwater defence system]] was a layered system of liquid- and air-filled compartments as used in the ''Illustrious'' class. The [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s for the 4.5-inch guns lay outside the armoured citadel and were protected by 2 to 3-inch roofs, 4.5-inch sides and 1.5 to 2-inch ends.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 134, 139, 142–43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
[[File:The Launching of the Aircraft Carrier HMS Indefatigable at Glasgow, Scotland, 8 December 1942 A13185.jpg|thumb|right|The launching of ''Indefatigable'', 8 December 1942]]
''Indefatigable'' was [[Keel|laid down]] by [[John Brown &amp; Company|John Brown &amp; Co.]] at their shipyard in [[Clydebank]] on 3 November 1939 as Yard Number 565.&lt;ref name=h1&gt;Hobbs 2013, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 8 December 1942 by [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine|Victoria of Hesse]], Dowager [[Marquess of Milford Haven|Marchioness of Milford Haven]]. [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Quentin Graham was appointed to command the ship in August 1943.&lt;ref name=m8&gt;McCart, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; While [[fitting out]], in order to confound the enemy, a ruse known as Operation Bijou, initiated by [[London Controlling Section]], was launched whereby it was made known that ''Indefatigable'' had already entered service. [[Ultra]] decrypts revealed that the Japanese believed the deception, with operatives including [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] and [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] supplying disinformation for more than a year, sufficient to make the enemy believe the vessel had gone to the Far East and returned to the Clyde for a refit, by which time she was actually finished.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, pp. 389–90, 810&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was commissioned on 8 December 1943&lt;ref name=m8/&gt; and began sea trials, which revealed many problems that required rectification and delayed her formal completion until 3 May 1944. While ''Indefatigable'' was still conducting builder's trials,&lt;ref name=&quot;m9&quot;/&gt; a [[de Havilland Mosquito]] landed aboard on 25 March, piloted by Lieutenant [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]]. This was the first landing by a twin-engined aeroplane on a carrier.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was assigned to the Home Fleet and was [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]] over the next several months while the [[Fairey Firefly|Fairey Fireflies]] of [[1770 Naval Air Squadron|1770 Squadron]] flew aboard on 18 May. The squadron was followed by the [[Fairey Barracuda]] torpedo bombers of [[826 Naval Air Squadron|826 Squadron]] in June.&lt;ref name=m9&gt;McCart, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegian operations===
''Indefatigable''{{'}}s first mission was a brief sortie on 1 July 1944 to provide air cover for the [[ocean liner]] {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} that was ferrying American troops to Britain.&lt;ref name=m9/&gt; Upon her return, ''Indefatigable'' embarked the [[Supermarine Seafire]] fighters of [[887 Naval Air Squadron|887 Squadron]] and the Barracudas of [[820 Naval Air Squadron|820 Squadron]], completing [[No. 9 Naval Torpedo-Bomber Reconnaissance Wing]], over the next week.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtivant 1984, pp. 247–48, 370&lt;/ref&gt; Her first combat mission was an attack on the battleship ''Tirpitz'' in [[Kåfjorden (Alta)|Kaafjord]] on 17 July with two other Home Fleet carriers ([[Operation Mascot]]). She contributed 23 Barracudas and 12 Fireflies to the mission; the former attacked the battleship while the Fireflies [[Strafing|strafed]] the [[flak]] positions defending her. A [[smoke screen]] prevented most of the Barracudas from seeing their target and they failed to hit ''Tirpitz''. One Barracuda was forced to [[Water landing|ditch]] near the carrier and its crew was rescued by the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Verulam|R28|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 149–50&lt;/ref&gt;

[[894 Naval Air Squadron|894 Squadron]], equipped with Seafires, landed aboard after the attack on 24 July to complete [[No. 24 Naval Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturtivant 1984, pp. 386, 471&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indefatigable'' and several [[escort carrier]]s attacked targets in Norway on 10 August,  destroying 6 [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] fighters and sinking a [[minesweeper]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Operation Goodwood]], a series of attacks on ''Tirpitz'', the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]] fighters of [[1840 Naval Air Squadron|1840 Squadron]] replaced the Barracudas of 826 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtivant 1984, pp. 276, 420&lt;/ref&gt; The first mission took place on the morning of 22 August when ''Indefatigable'' launched 12 Barracudas, 11 Fireflies, 8 Hellcats, and 8 Seafires against the German battleship and nearby targets. A smoke screen again protected ''Tirpitz'' and no damage was inflicted; two Seafires failed to return. Another attack was made later in the day without effect. A further attack could not be mounted until 24 August because of bad weather; for this mission the carrier contributed 12 Barracudas, 11 Fireflies and 4 Seafires, all of which returned.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, p. 28; McCart, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Thomas states that the commanding officer of 1840 Squadron was lost on 24 August,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; but McCart does not list any Hellcats flying that day. Sturtivant does show the named pilot as commander of 1840 Squadron, although his successor is not named until 12 September.&lt;ref name=s20&gt;Sturtivant 1984, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} ''Tirpitz'' was lightly damaged by two hits during this attack, one a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb and the other a {{convert|1600|lb|adj=on}} armour-piercing bomb. The latter penetrated the armoured deck but failed to explode and would probably have inflicted serious damage, possibly even sinking the ship, had it done so.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtivant 1990, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; A final attack was made five days later, again without effect.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, pp. 267–68&lt;/ref&gt; 887 Squadron sank seven [[seaplane]]s at their [[wikt:moor|moorings]] at [[Banak, Norway|Banak]] during the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Ocean and Pacific operations===
[[File:HMS Indefatigable FL22353.jpg|thumb|Profile view of ''Indefatigable'' at anchor]]
On 19 September 1944, ''Indefatigable'' sortied from Scapa Flow to attack targets near [[Tromsø]], but the operation was cancelled because of bad weather. The ship underwent a brief refit at her builder's yard between 28 September and 8 November. She became the flagship of the [[1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron (Royal Navy)|1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron]] (1st ACS) when [[Rear Admiral]] Sir [[Philip Vian]] hoisted his flag on 15 November. The following day, King [[George VI]] inspected the ship; the ground crews later embarked for 820, 887, 894 and 1770 Squadrons. Their aircraft, 40 Seafires, 12 Fireflies, and 21 [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] torpedo bombers, followed on 19 November, and she sailed for the [[Far East]] to join the British Pacific Fleet. ''Indefatigable'' arrived at [[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]], on 10 December and Vian transferred his flag to {{HMS|Indomitable|R92|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with ''Victorious'' and ''Indomitable'', ''Indefatigable'' attacked an [[oil refinery]] at [[Pangkalan Brandan]], Sumatra on 4 January 1945 ([[Operation Lentil (Sumatra)|Operation Lentil]]). She embarked six photoreconnaissance Hellcats of [[888 Naval Air Squadron|888 Squadron]] for the attack; her only contribution to the attack itself was the Fireflies of 1770 Squadron, which used [[RP-3]] rocket projectiles on their targets. The squadron claimed to have shot down a [[Nakajima Ki-43]] &quot;Oscar&quot;, for the loss of a Firefly that ran out of fuel and had to ditch next to the ship. After ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s return, Admiral Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]], [[Supreme Allied Commander]] [[South East Asia Command]], addressed the crew on 11 January.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, pp. 83–84; McCart, pp. 152–53&lt;/ref&gt; En route to [[Sydney]] to prepare for operations in the Pacific, the BPF's carriers attacked oil refineries near [[Palembang]], Sumatra, on 24 and 29 January ([[Operation Meridian]]). The ship's Seafires lacked the range to reach the targets so they were retained on [[combat air patrol]]s (CAP) over the fleet for both attacks. She contributed 10 of her Avengers and all of her Fireflies to the first attack, which destroyed most of the oil storage tanks and cut the refinery's output by half for three months. Five days later, the BPF attacked a different refinery and 820 Squadron again contributed 10 Avengers to the attack while 1770 Squadron added 9 Fireflies. The latter squadron also flew 2 Fireflies on an armed reconnaissance mission over an airfield that lay between the carriers and their target. The attack was very successful at heavy cost, but the losses of ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s squadrons are not available. Her Seafires shot down a [[Mitsubishi Ki-46]] &quot;Dinah&quot; reconnaissance aircraft searching for the fleet and 5 [[Kawasaki Ki-48]] &quot;Lily&quot; bombers that attacked at low level.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, pp. 92–93; McCart, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The BPF arrived in Sydney on 10 February; the crews received leave and the ships got some maintenance before they sailed for the BPF's advance base at [[Manus Island]], in the [[Admiralty Islands]], on 27 February. They arrived on 7 March and exercised together before sailing for [[Ulithi]] on 18 March. The BPF joined the American [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]] there two days later to participate in the preliminary operations for the invasion of Okinawa. The British role during the operation was to neutralise airfields on the [[Sakishima Islands]], between Okinawa and [[Formosa]], beginning on 26 March.&lt;ref name=m5&gt;McCart, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Her Seafires were again retained to defend the fleet and only her Avengers and Fireflies attacked the airfields. Her Seafire squadrons lacked 13 of their authorised strength of 50 pilots and could not sustain the pace of the first day of operations, when they flew 72 sorties.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs 2011, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; After a break at the end of the month to refuel, ''Indefatigable'' became the first British carrier to be hit by a kamikaze the day after flying operations resumed, when one of the Japanese planes evaded the CAP and struck the base of the carrier's island on 1 April. The bomb it carried did not detonate and this limited casualties to 21 men killed and 27 wounded.&lt;ref name=m5/&gt; Damage to the ship was minimal and the flight deck was back in operation thirty minutes later.&lt;ref name=h13/&gt; On 12 and 13 April, the BPF switched targets to airfields in northern Formosa. On the first day, a pair of Fireflies encountered five [[Mitsubishi Ki-51]] &quot;Sonia&quot; dive bombers and shot down four of them. A flight of four Seafires on CAP spotted four Japanese fighters, three [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]es and a [[Kawasaki Ki-61]] &quot;Tony&quot; later that morning, and shot down one Zero. The BPF returned to the Sakishima Islands on 17 April before retiring to [[Leyte Gulf]] to rest and resupply. Wastage of Seafires to all causes was very heavy during the operation with 25 out of 40 lost or damaged beyond repair and only 5 replacements received. Their short range and lack of endurance was considered by Vian to be a severe handicap for the BPF, which returned to action on 4 May and again attacked targets in the Sakishima Islands. Its aircraft continued to do so until they flew their last missions of Operation Iceberg on 25 May. Statistics complied by the BPF staff showed that 61 Seafires were lost or damaged beyond repair during both phases of the operation due to deck-landing accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs 2011, pp. 147, 150, 152–53, 175, 195, 197&lt;/ref&gt;

The BPF arrived back at Sydney on 5 June and sailed for Manus three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 155–56&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indefatigable'' was forced to remain behind as she required repairs to her machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs 2011, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Her air group flew aboard on 7 July ([[1772 Naval Air Squadron|1772 Squadron]] and its Fireflies replacing 1770 Squadron) when she sailed for Manus. She reached the coast of Japan on 20 July and her aircraft began attacking targets near [[Osaka]] and in the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]] four days later. Her Seafire squadrons had adapted larger external fuel tanks for their aircraft and they were no longer limited to CAP duty.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs 2011, pp. 212–13, 253; McCart, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The BPF's aircraft crippled the escort carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaiyo||2}} and sank numerous smaller ships on 24 July.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs 2011, pp. 261, 263, 266–67&lt;/ref&gt; After replenishing, airstrikes resumed on 28 and 30 July, the British sinking the escort {{ship|Japanese escort ship|Okinawa||2}} near [[Maizuru]]. A combination of bad weather, refuelling requirements and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] delayed the resumption of air operations until 9 August. During the day, ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s aircraft attacked targets in northern [[Honshu]] and southern [[Hokkaido]]. The attacks were repeated the next day, sinking two warships and numerous small merchantmen and destroying numerous railroad locomotives and parked aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs 2011, pp. 273–81, 286–87&lt;/ref&gt;

The BPF had been scheduled to withdraw after 10 August to prepare for [[Operation Olympic]], the invasion of [[Kyushu]] scheduled for November, and the bulk of the force departed for Manus on 12 August. ''Indefatigable'', however, had been chosen to remain as part of the Allied occupation force. The next day her aircraft attacked targets in the vicinity of Tokyo. Flight operations resumed on the morning of the 15th after an operational pause to refuel. The first airstrike was tasked to attack Kisarazu Air Field with four Fireflies and six Avengers, escorted by eight Seafires, but was forced to divert to its secondary target because of bad weather. En route they were attacked by a dozen Zeros in the last British air combat of the war. The Japanese fighters shot down one Seafire on their first pass and crippled an Avenger. The Seafires claimed four Zeros shot down, four others probably shot down, and another four damaged. An Avenger also claimed one Zero as damaged. A [[Yokosuka D4Y]] &quot;Judy&quot; dive bomber attacked the carrier after the ceasefire went into effect, but its two bombs missed.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs 2011, pp. 288–92&lt;/ref&gt; After the ceasefire, ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s aircraft continued to fly CAP and flew reconnaissance missions looking for Allied prisoners of war, dropping supplies to them as they were located.&lt;ref name=h13&gt;Hobbs 2013, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aircraft carriers, c.1946 (5124135353).jpg|thumb|''Indefatigable'' refitting at [[Woolloomooloo]], Sydney, 1945]]
On 17 August 1945, Admiral Sir [[Bruce Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape|Bruce Fraser]], commander of the BPF, came aboard and addressed the crew. ''Indefatigable'' continued flying operations until she entered [[Sagami Bay]] on 5 September. She departed three days later for Manus en route to Sydney. The ship arrived at Sydney on 18 September and began a leisurely refit that lasted until 15 November. On 1 November, Captain Ian MacIntyre relieved Graham as captain of the ship. She became Vian's flagship on 22 November and sailed to New Zealand to show the flag. She arrived in [[Wellington]] on 27 November and was opened for public tours, during which time the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]], also visited. ''Indefatigable'' then sailed to [[Auckland]], arriving on 12 December, and was again opened for tours. She returned to Sydney for the holidays and visited [[Melbourne]] on 22 January 1946 before departing for home nine days later. Vian transferred his flag to her [[sister ship]] ''Implacable'' that day and the ship stopped off at [[Fremantle]] and [[Cape Town]] en route. While ''Indefatigable'' was visiting the latter city, she was opened to the public, and the [[Governor-General of South Africa]] toured the ship.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 156–57&lt;/ref&gt;

The carrier arrived at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]] on 16 March 1946. Her hangars were modified to accommodate over 1,900 passengers, including women, and she departed for Australia on 25 April carrying 782 RN personnel and 130 Australian [[war bride]]s. Most of the RN personnel disembarked at Colombo and most of the war brides did the same at Fremantle. ''Indefatigable'' continued on to Sydney, where she embarked a complete naval hospital, with patients, and over 1,000 RN officers and ratings. She departed on 9 June and arrived at Plymouth on 7 July. Her next voyage involved transporting a much smaller number of men to [[Malta]] and Colombo; only 47 officers and 67 ratings, most of whom left the ship at Malta. When she arrived at Colombo on 15 August, she loaded a full complement of passengers from all three services to return to the UK. The ship arrived at Portsmouth on 9 September and her next voyage involved over 1,200 RN personnel and civilians ferried to Malta, Colombo, and [[Singapore]] where almost 1,300 personnel embarked. She returned to Portsmouth on 29 November and began a brief refit in preparation for her final trooping voyage. ''Indefatigable'' sailed empty for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where she loaded RN personnel before returning to Portsmouth on 21 November. The next month, she was placed in reserve and Captain MacIntyre retired on 7 January 1947.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 156–64&lt;/ref&gt;

The Admiralty decided to recommission ''Indefatigable'' for use as a training ship in mid-1949. Captain [[Henry St John Fancourt|Henry Fancourt]] assumed command on 22 August to prepare for sea. The ship arrived at Devonport to begin the necessary modifications on 30 August and the following day Fancourt turned over command to the dockyard. Captain John Grindle was appointed to command on 24 March 1950 and the ship was recommissioned on 28 May. Two days later Captain [[Robert Sherbrooke]], [[Victoria Cross|VC]], relieved Grindle and ''Indefatigable'' began her sea trials on 28 June. She was inspected by Rear Admiral [[St John Micklethwaithe]], Flag Officer Training Squadron, on 3 July and received her first trainees shortly afterwards. She participated in exercises with the Home Fleet and joined it in Gibraltar in September and October. On 12 March 1951 she sortied from [[Portland Harbour|Portland]], flying Micklethwaite's flag, to exercise with the Home Fleet before beginning a brief refit at Devonport in May. Captain John Grant relieved Sherbrooke on 6 June and the ship was opened to visitors as part of the [[Festival of Britain]] on 17 July. Five days later the visitors were stranded aboard ship overnight when a storm came up and forced ''Indefatigable'' to put to sea. The seas moderated the next day and the visitors departed in safety. Rear Admiral [[Royer Dick]] hoisted his flag aboard the carrier in September until she began a short refit at Devonport in January 1952.&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 164–65&lt;/ref&gt;

''Indefatigable'' joined ''Implacable'' for her annual winter visit to Gibraltar after completing her refit in February 1952. Over the summer she exercised with the Home Fleet and visited the Danish port of [[Aarhus]], where she was visited by Queen [[Alexandrine of Denmark]] in July. Captain Ralph Fisher assumed command on 30 January 1953 and took her to sea three weeks later for exercises with the Home Fleet and her annual visit to Gibraltar. She returned to Portland in late March and visited Bournemouth at the end of May. She joined her sister and several other carriers on 9 June to sail for [[Spithead]] for the [[Fleet review (Commonwealth realms)#Elizabeth II|Coronation Fleet Review]] of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] on 15 June as one of a fleet of nine carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtivant 1990, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indefatigable'' joined her sister for fleet exercises off the [[Scilly Isles]] and in the [[Bristol Channel]] in September and October before beginning her annual refit on 6 October. The Admiralty announced on 26 January 1954 that both ships would be replaced as training ships and reduced to reserve. This had no short-term impact on their activities as they sailed for the Western Mediterranean on their annual winter cruise. The ship exercised with the Home Fleet and made a port visit to [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]], before visiting Gibraltar. Captain Hugh Browne assumed command on 10 May after Fisher had been promoted. The ship welcomed home Queen Elizabeth II and her husband four days later as they returned from their tour of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The following month, ''Indefatigable'' exercised with the Home Fleet in Scottish waters and visited Aarhus again. In August she began transferring her training duties to the carrier {{HMS|Ocean|R68|2}} and arrived at Rosyth on 2 September to be [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]], a process that took until the following month to complete. She was towed to [[Gareloch]] in June 1955 where she was listed for disposal. ''Indefatigable'' was sold for scrap in September 1956 and subsequently broken up at [[Faslane]].&lt;ref&gt;McCart, pp. 167–68&lt;/ref&gt;
