The '''Castle-class corvettes''' were an updated version of the much more numerous {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}}s of the [[Royal Navy]], and started appearing during late 1943. They were equipped with [[radar]] as well as [[asdic]].

==Design==
The [[Admiralty]] had decided to cease Flower-class construction in favour of the larger {{sclass2-|River|frigate}}s as the Flower class had originally been intended for coastal escort work and were not entirely satisfactory for [[Atlantic]] [[convoy]] service. In particular, they were slow, poorly armed and rolled badly in rough seas, which quickly exhausted their crews. However, many shipyards were not large enough to build frigates. The Castle class was designed to be built on small slipways for about half the overall effort of a {{sclass2-|Loch|frigate}}. The Loch-class frigate was similar to a River but built using the system of prefabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of Castle-class corvettes was much like the later &quot;long forecastle&quot; variant of the Flowers and they were a little larger (around 1,200 tons – about 200 tons more than the Flowers, and {{convert|40|ft|m}} longer).

The most obvious visual difference, was the lattice mainmast instead of the pole version fitted to the Flowers. There was also a more square cut look to the stern although it was still essentially a [[cruiser spoon]] type, this difference was only visible from [[abaft]] the [[beam (nautical)|beam]].

The armament differed from the Flower class with the [[depth charge]] fitment replaced by one [[Squid (mortar)|Squid anti-submarine mortar]]. ''Hadleigh Castle'' received the first production Squid mounting; the World War I-era medium-velocity surface-only [[BL 4 inch Mk IX naval gun|BL 4-inch Mk IX]] main gun firing a {{convert|31|lb|kg|sing=on}} shell was replaced by the new low-velocity [[QF 4 inch Mk XIX naval gun|QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun]] on high-angle/low-angle mounting firing a heavier {{convert|35|lb|kg|sing=on}} shell, which added anti-aircraft capability to the existing capability against surface targets such as submarines.

The propulsion machinery was identical to the Flowers and experienced officers felt that they were seriously under powered, having a tendency to turn into the wind despite everything the [[helmsman]] could do. The fact that Squid attacks required a fairly low speed (compared to depth charge attacks) only made matters worse.

Most of the Castle-class corvettes had been discarded by the end of the 1950s but a few survived a little longer as [[weather ship]]s. The last Castle was the [[Uruguay]]an training ship ''Montevideo'', originally {{HMS|Rising Castle|K398|6}}, which was scrapped in 1975.

Most were operated by the [[Royal Navy]] but twelve were transferred to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) before completion and one to the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]. Three Castles were sunk through enemy action and Castles participated in the sinking of seven [[U-boat]]s.

== Ships ==

===Royal Canadian Navy===
The following vessels were all originally built for the Royal Navy, but were transferred to the RCN on completion (for details of builders and construction dates see under Royal Navy below). All their pennant numbers (except ''Hedingham Castle'', which was never completed), as well as their names, were changed when transferred.
* HMCS ''Arnprior'' (K494) (ex-{{HMS|Rising Castle|K398|6}})
* HMCS ''Bowmanville'' (K493) (ex-{{HMS|Nunney Castle|K446|6}}), sold to [[Republic of China]] as cargo ship, but taken over by [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLAN]] after end of [[Chinese Civil War]] and rearmed with Soviet guns, entering PLAN service as [[Guangzhou]].
* HMCS ''Copper Cliff'' (K495) (ex-{{HMS|Hever Castle|K521|6}})
* HMCS ''Hespeler'' (K489) (ex-{{HMS|Guildford Castle|K378|6}}) (later SS ''Chilcotin'')
* HMCS ''Humberstone'' (K497) (ex-{{HMS|Norham Castle|K447|6}})
* HMCS ''Huntsville'' (K499) (ex-{{HMS|Wolvesey Castle|K461|6}})
* HMCS ''Kincardine'' (K490) (ex-{{HMS|Tamworth Castle|K393|6}})
* HMCS ''Leaside'' (K492) (ex-{{HMS|Walmer Castle|K405|6}}, later SS ''Coquitlam II'')
* HMCS ''Orangeville'' (K491) (ex-{{HMS|Hedingham Castle|K491|6}}), sold to [[Republic of China]] as cargo ship, but taken over by [[ROCN]] on June 29, 1950 and rearmed with US guns, entering ROCN service as ''De An'' (德安)
* HMCS ''Petrolia'' (K498) (ex-{{HMS|Sherborne Castle|K453|6}})
* HMCS ''St. Thomas'' (K488) (ex-{{HMS|Sandgate Castle|K473|6}}, later SS ''Camosun III'')
* HMCS ''Tillsonburg'' (K496) (ex-{{HMS|Pembroke Castle|K450|6}}), sold to [[Republic of China]] as cargo ship, but taken over by [[ROCN]] on June 29, 1950 and rearmed with US guns, entering ROCN service as ''Kao An'' (高安)

===Royal Navy===
The initial Castle-class ship was ''Allington Castle'', re-ordered on 9 December 1942 (from the previous order placed for a Modified Flower-class corvette named ''Amaryllis''); another 13 vessels were ordered on 19 December, also under the 1942 War Programme.
