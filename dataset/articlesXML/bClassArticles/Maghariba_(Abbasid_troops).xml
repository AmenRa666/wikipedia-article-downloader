      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10300">The '''Maghariba''' ({{Lang-ar|'''المغاربة'''}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-Maghāribah}}'', meaning &quot;Westerners&quot;) were a regiment in the [[regular army]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The unit was formed in the early ninth century A.D. and consisted of soldiers who were of [[North Africa]]n origin. During their history, the Maghariba participated in several military campaigns and played a significant role in the politics of the central government.

==Characteristics==
The origin and composition of the Maghariba have been subject to debate. Historians have variously described the Maghariba as [[Berbers]] from North Africa, black slaves from [[East Africa]], and Arab tribesmen from [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;Talbi, p. 1160; Saliba, p. 113 n. 317&lt;/ref&gt; with the last being the most widely accepted theory.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 38–39; Kennedy, pp. 125-26; al-Bili, p. 47; Cooperson, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[List of Muslim historians|Muslim historian]] [[al-Mas'udi]], the regiment was created by Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] (r. 833–842), who recruited troops from the [[Hawf (Egypt)|Hawf]] districts of Egypt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Mas'udi, v. 7: p. 118. See also Ibn al-Athir, v. 6: p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; this likely occurred before al-Mu'tasim's caliphate, when he and [[al-Afshin]] were serving in Egypt on behalf of the caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] (r. 813–833).&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

After the succession of al-Mu'tasim to the caliphate in 833, the Maghariba formed a contingent of the his new army, along with other units such as the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], the [[Faraghina]], the [[Ushrusaniyya]], and the ''[[shakiriyya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 118 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the rest of the army, they were granted their own section in al-Mu'tasim's new capital city of [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]; their allotments were along the Gulf Street (''shāri' al-khalīj'') adjacent to the bank of the [[Tigris]], and the Azlakh quarter was known as a Maghribi neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 185 n. 259; Northedge, p. 120; al-Ya'qubi, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maghariba appear to have served as infantry,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 104; al-Ya'qubi, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; and they were a mixture of free men and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 39; Kennedy, p. 126; Northedge, p. 171; al-Tabari, v. 34: pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; They were likely fewer in number than the Turks, and they were certainly of inferior status. Their pay also appears to have been lower;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; on the accession of [[al-Mutawakkil]] (r. 847–861), the new caliph ordered that the Maghariba be given lower allotments than the rest of the army,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 34: p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; and in 870 [[al-Muhtadi]]  (r. 869–870) arranged for the Maghariba to be paid one ''[[dirham]]'' a day, while the Turks and other units received two.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Abbasids Ninth Century.svg|thumb|right|400px|The Maghariba served under al-Mu'tasim and several of his successors]]

The Maghariba participated in [[Sack of Amorium|al-Mu'tasim's campaign against Amorium]] in 838, during which they were under the overall command of [[Itakh]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 33: p. 113; Ibn al-Athir, v. 6: p. 487; ''Kitab al-'Uyun,'' pp. 393–94&lt;/ref&gt; During the caliphates of [[al-Wathiq]] (r. 842–847) and [[al-Mutawakkil]] (r. 847–861) they took part in a number of [[Bugha al-Kabir]]'s campaigns. In 845 they served under Bugha during his punitive expedition against the disorderly [[Banu Sulaym]] in the vicinity of [[Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 34: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 848–49 they were sent by Bugha to help quell a revolt in [[Adharbayjan]],&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 34: p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; and in 852 they fought in his campaign to defeat [[Ishaq ibn Isma'il]], the rebel [[Emirate of Tbilisi|governor of Tiflis]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 34: pp. 122–23; Ibn al-Athir, v. 7: p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In 855–56 several Maghariba were selected to provide escort for a prisoner exchange with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 34: p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the assassination of al-Mutawakkil in December 861, the Maghariba played an important role during the events of the [[Anarchy at Samarra]] (861–870). On the day that [[al-Muntasir]] was given the oath of allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]''), the Maghariba were employed as riot troops against residents in the capital who opposed the new caliph.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 34: p. 203; Ibn al-Athir, v. 7: p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; After al-Muntasir's death in 862 they, together with the Turks and Ushrusaniyya, agreed to recognize [[al-Musta'in]] as caliph,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 1; Ibn al-Athir, v. 7: p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and they were again used to attack rioters who favored al-Musta'in's rival [[al-Mu'tazz]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 4; Ibn al-Athir, v. 7: p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, during a particularly severe riot in Samarra, the Maghariba looted the homes of several civilians;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 11; Ibn al-Athir, v. 7: p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; a few months later, having become increasingly dissatisfied with the current regime, they organized in the capital to voice their agitation, but they ultimately decided to take no action and dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Caliphal Civil War (865–866)|civil war]] broke out between al-Musta'in and al-Mu'tazz in 865, the Maghariba fought in support of the latter. Two thousand Maghariba under the command of [[Muhammad ibn Rashid al-Maghribi]] were part of the initial force sent from Samarra to besiege al-Musta'in in [[Baghdad]], and over the course of the war they participated in several battles. Their involvement continued until the end of the war, from which al-Mu'tazz emerged victorious and al-Musta'in was forced to abdicate.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 43 ff.; Ibn al-Athir, v. 7: pp. 145 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Maghariba continued returned to Samarra, which soon again suffered from disorder. In 866 a conflict broke out between the Maghariba and the Turkish soldiers, and during the ensuing violence two senior Maghariba commanders were killed by the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 140–41; Ibn al-Athir, v. 7: pp. 173–74&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the Maghariba killed the Turkish general [[Bugha al-Sharabi]] and brought his head to the caliph.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Mas'udi, v. 7: p. 396; al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 153–54. In the latter source the killing is accredited to a single man named Walid al-Maghribi, after which the Maghariba took the corpse and burned it.&lt;/ref&gt; In 869, however, the Maghariba united with the Turks and Faraghina to successfully depose al-Mu'tazz.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 164; Ibn al-Athir, v. 7: p. 195. According to al-Mas'udi, v. 7: p. 397, al-Mu'tazz had attempted to favor the Maghariba and Faraghina at the expense of the Turks, which led to the latter overthrowing him.&lt;/ref&gt; Under al-Mu'tazz's successor, [[al-Muhtadi]], they participated in some of the initial campaigns against the [[Zanj Rebellion|Zanj rebels]] in southern [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 55; Ibn al-Athir, v. 7: p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; In 870, during the revolt against al-Muhtadi, the Maghariba remained loyal to the caliph; they unsuccessfully defended him against the mutinous Turkish soldiers, and suffered high casualties as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 93–95, 97–98, 104; al-Mas'udi, v. 8: pp. 8–9; Ibn al-Athir, v. 7: pp. 229 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accession of [[al-Mu'tamid]] (r. 870–892) seems to have resulted in the decline of the Maghariba. Al-Mu'tamid's brother [[Al-Muwaffaq|Abu Ahmad al-Muwaffaq]], who became the commander-in-chief of the army, enjoyed strong relations with the Turkish commanders, and under him the Turks came to dominate the military, to the exclusion of the Maghariba and other units. After this point, the Maghariba are seldom mentioned in the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; A government budget drawn up in 892–93 lists &quot;Maghariba&quot; as forming a contingent of the bodyguards of the caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] (r. 892–902),&lt;ref&gt;Busse, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not specified as to whether this was the same unit as the Samarran Maghariba.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 166 n. 70&lt;/ref&gt;
