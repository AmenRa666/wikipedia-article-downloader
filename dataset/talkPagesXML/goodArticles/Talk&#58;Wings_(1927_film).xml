==1926 or 1927?==
I was just watching an old episode of &lt;i&gt;[[This Is Your Life]]&lt;/i&gt; with [[Jesse L. Lasky]] on it and it said this movie was from [[1926]]. Which is it - 1926 or [[1927]]?&lt;br/&gt;[[User:70.69.50.77|70.69.50.77]] 03:50, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

: 1927.  ([[User:JosephASpadaro|JosephASpadaro]] 06:42, 30 May 2007 (UTC))
::All references list the film's release year as 1927, but it was not honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences until early 1929. [[User:Sallyrob|Sallyrob]] ([[User talk:Sallyrob|talk]]) 11:49, 22 April 2008 (UTC)

:: Recording started 1926. [[User:Parrotistic|Parrotistic]] ([[User talk:Parrotistic|talk]]) 13:20, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

==Home Video==
Although ''Wings'' has been shown on American Movie Classics and Turner Classic Movies, it has not been released on DVD.  With the publication of William Wellman Jr.'s book, there is growing pressure to release the film on home video.   [[User:Sallyrob|Sallyrob]] ([[User talk:Sallyrob|talk]]) 11:50, 22 April 2008 (UTC)

It's on VHS [[User:Spartacus007|Spartacus007]] ([[User talk:Spartacus007|talk]]) 01:23, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

It's on DVD as well because I have it.  Actually I have Cavalcade as well so that statement is incorrect.  I'm a movie collector and own EVERY Best Picture.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.24.109.255|98.24.109.255]] ([[User talk:98.24.109.255|talk]]) 05:46, 3 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: Neither Wings nor Cavalcade have had an official *Region 1* release. Amazon.co.uk lists the Cavacade Region 2 DVD, but not one for Wings. [[User:Ttenchantr|Ttenchantr]] ([[User talk:Ttenchantr|talk]]) 23:40, 23 August 2010 (UTC)

==Production==

It is one of the first films to feature a male-on-male kiss – a fraternal one 

Five years earlier, 

In the 1922 &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;
Valentino (as Juan Gallardo) kisses the character Zapaterin (or was it Chiripa?) who dies from being gored by a bull.

This and the mention of nudity seem to be more &quot;cultural items&quot; rather than &quot;Production&quot; - though I consider them important  - everyone seems to forget that people have always been human!  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/216.39.144.40|216.39.144.40]] ([[User talk:216.39.144.40|talk]]) 04:27, 15 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001) is derived from &quot;Wings&quot; ==

I think it should be mentioned that the 2001 movie &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; was just a re-write of &quot;Wings&quot;.  [[Special:Contributions/63.207.238.150|63.207.238.150]] ([[User talk:63.207.238.150|talk]]) 09:25, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

: It's noted, I'll look into it.[[User:Parrotistic|Parrotistic]] ([[User talk:Parrotistic|talk]]) 13:22, 11 January 2011 (UTC)
::Pure supposition, may not be worth it. FWiW [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 14:10, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:::I concur with Bzuk. A quick [[WP:SET|search engine test]] does not reveal any kind of relationship. [[User:Erik|Erik]] ([[User talk:Erik|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Erik|contribs]]) 14:53, 11 January 2011 (UTC)
::::The two movies have the same love triangle plot.  Two guys in love with the same girl, one dies in the other's arms after the planes crash land.  The scene with Clara Bow, the ambulance driver, in the village right before it is bombed, then taking cover from the bombing, then the two pilots taking off to shoot down enemy planes--this is copied in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; for the sneak bombing attack on Pearl.  The champagne scene is derived from Wings.  And so on.  [[Special:Contributions/69.236.143.238|69.236.143.238]] ([[User talk:69.236.143.238|talk]]) 01:18, 15 January 2011 (UTC)

:::::Hey IP user, ever hear the prase &quot;nothing new under the sun?&quot; Just because they share common dramatic themes does not mean the later one is a &quot;copy&quot; of the old one. [[User:Jros83|Jersey John]] ([[User talk:Jros83|talk]]) 23:11, 12 January 2012 (UTC)

== Date of Rediscovery ==

What is the date (or at least the year) that this film was rediscovered? Does anyone know? I think I saw a news article from the 1980s about this film being found, but I can't find this article again right now.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.31.210.87|75.31.210.87]] ([[User talk:75.31.210.87|talk]]) 07:51, 18 May 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
* Had to be before 1985, since I have a VHS tape of the film that was released in 1985. --[[User:Ryanasaurus007|Ryanasaurus007]] ([[User talk:Ryanasaurus007|talk]]) 17:29, 31 July 2014 (UTC)

== Game Wings (Amiga GBA)  a homage ==

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_%28video_game%29
http://www.cinemaware.com/history/
''
The gameplay looks similar to the action sequences of the 1927 silent movie also called Wings. The story shown before each mission is, however, different from the plot of the movie''
more:
-before and after mission are silent movie text writings - same like in the movie
- 'the bad Hun' style in writing ;)
- name ;)

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Wings (1927 film)]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=707248128 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive http://web.archive.org/web/20120127064411/http://www.criticizethis.ca:80/2012/01/qa-with-paramounts-vp-of-archives.html to http://www.criticizethis.ca/2012/01/qa-with-paramounts-vp-of-archives.html
