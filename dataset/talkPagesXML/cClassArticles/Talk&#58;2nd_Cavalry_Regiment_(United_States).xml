== Title ==

The title for this article is wrong - it should be U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment. 2d is not a proper numerical representation.

:The US Army doesn't put the &quot;n&quot; in 2nd... nor do they put the &quot;r&quot; in 3rd- so you see 2d and 3d.  Which, I assume, is why it keeps getting written that way here.  Cheers --[[User:DarthBinky|DarthBinky]] 04:15, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

::Can you source that? [[User:ExarPalantas|ExarPalantas]] ([[User talk:ExarPalantas|talk]]) 07:39, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

We used 2nd Armored Cavalry, 2nd Armd Cav, (2A/C maybe), the 3 years I was there 1962-1965. I never saw 2d from us, VII Corps, or 7th Army.,----

Official Army designations do indeed use 2d and 3d; however, people tend to use 2nd and 3rd because that's what they're accustomed to using. For examples of official designations, see the US Army Center of Military History website at

== article not quite clear ==

re the last sentence:''In 2006 1st Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division, reflagged as the 2d Stryker Cavalry Regiment and restationed to Rose Barracks, Vilseck, Germany.'': that sentence is not clear. so the 25th ID lost a brigade? what's that got to do the 2d ACR?
[[User:Mct mht|Mct mht]] 05:13, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

:Reflagging means that one unit has it's name and &quot;history&quot; changed to that of another. The original unit (in this case 2d ACR) is either deactivated or reflagged to something else. This time the 2d ACR was reflagged as a brigade of the 2d Infantry Division, and the 1st of the 25th was reflagged as the 2d SCR.

[[:2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment]] → [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)]] &amp;mdash; Title of article should be changed so that it is in accordance with the Wikipedia military unit naming convention.  Only a fraction of the units exsistance has been as a &quot;Stryker&quot; unit.  There is a naming convention in place, let's use it.  [[User:Joshuashearn|Joshuashearn]] ([[User talk:Joshuashearn|talk]]) 19:12, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

:While the 2d SCR uses the 2d Cavalry Regiment history, 2CR is not the proper or official name, 2SCR is. If you want to actually stick to the historical name of the unit, you'd have to change the title to 2d Dragoons (United States), which was the original name of the unit. It doesn't really matter what the regiment has been called in the past - it's called 2d Stryker Cavalry Regiment now. If they change it to 2d Stryker Dragoons sometime in the future, we'll change the page name to that. If anything, the name should be moved to 2d Stryker Cavalry Regiment since &quot;2d&quot; is the official and proper spelling used by the Army. Don't ask why, it just is. I can take the blame for the &quot;2nd&quot; in the current title - I did that editing and made that mistake. Additionally, the two most common short names for the regiment are 2SCR (the official abbreviation) or simply &quot;Strykers,&quot; since it's the only Stryker unit in Europe, and that vehicle differentiates 2SCR from the neighboring heavy brigade (172d Infantry Brigade) at Grafenwoehr. If I seem a little zealous about this, it's because 2d SCR is my unit. [[User:Carnefice|Carnefice]] ([[User talk:Carnefice|talk]]) 02:51, 1 July 2009 (UTC)
**'''Moved''' to [[:2d Stryker Cavalry Regiment]] per [http://www.2scr.army.mil/ http://www.2scr.army.mil/] and this discussion. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 19:47, 2 July 2009 (UTC)
*Carnefice - I admire your zealousness but bottom line is the unit is the 2d Cavalry Regiment.  So when the Stryker is outdated and replace with whatever vehicle the Army decides, then we will again have to make this move?  Whether they are on horses, tanks, or APCs (Strykers), they are the 2d Cavalry Regiment.  Like  you, I'm in the Army and I'm well aware of what the Army calls this unit.  I also know something about naming conventions.  Just saying.... I stand by my recommendation to move this article.[[User:Joshuashearn|Joshuashearn]] ([[User talk:Joshuashearn|talk]]) 07:57, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

==&quot;Current Structure&quot; information contradiction==

In the graphical representation of the structure, it seems that the Anti Armor, MI, Engineer, and Signal troops stand alone and do not fall under any of the squadrons. Yet right next to it on the written description of the structure, the troops belong to specific squadrons. Which one is it???--[[User:Shovonma17|Shovonma17]] ([[User talk:Shovonma17|talk]]) 05:14, 24 January 2011 (UTC)

== Philippines as an Engagement? ==

According to Sawicki's lineage book, the 2nd Cav does not have a campaign streamer for the Philippines. Although most active regiments did rotate through the Philippines prior to World War I, I'm not sure we should list it as an engagement if it doesn't line up with official records and campaign participation credit. Thoughts?[[User:Intothatdarkness|Intothatdarkness]] ([[User talk:Intothatdarkness|talk]]) 14:03, 25 March 2011 (UTC)

I believe the campaign streamers refer to periods of active combat when the US was subjugating the Filipinos (1898-1902), and that streamers are not awarded for periods of non-combat occupation.[[User:VilePig|VilePig]] ([[User talk:VilePig|talk]]) 23:48, 6 March 2012 (UTC)

== Haiti service ==

''After six months in Haiti, 1st Squadron arrived to replace 3rd Squadron. 2nd Squadron replaced 3rd Squadron in October 1995 and redeployed in March 1996 completing the cycle''

Somehow does not make sense to me. --[[Special:Contributions/92.225.138.140|92.225.138.140]] ([[User talk:92.225.138.140|talk]]) 16:39, 15 October 2011 (UTC)

== Troops vs. Companies ==

Infantry battalions have companies while cavalry squadrons have troops; however, in this article I see squadrons with companies. I'm aware that such units are often predominately infantry and the infantrymen, to emphasize their MOSs, favor calling their units companies instead of troops.  What is the official, DA-approved designation?  Companies or troops?  I suspect the latter.[[User:VilePig|VilePig]] ([[User talk:VilePig|talk]]) 23:48, 6 March 2012 (UTC)
:Stryker units are infantry units, hence companies. [[User:Mct mht|Mct mht]] ([[User talk:Mct mht|talk]]) 23:57, 6 March 2012 (UTC)

I checked with the US Army Center of Military History which confirmed the units are officially designated as troops, not companies, even though the 2d is known for calling its units by other than correct designations. For further clarification contact Stephen Everett, Organizational History Team Leader, Force Structure and Unit History Branch, U.S. Army Center of Military History (AAMH-FPO), stephen.everett@us.army.mil   [[User:VilePig|VilePig]] ([[User talk:VilePig|talk]]) 14:39, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

I'm a soldier currently serving in 2CR and the companies are called Troops.. We used to be Comanche Company, however DA required us to change our headers and put &quot;Troop&quot; in. I suggest that the article be changed to reflect this.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/178.76.165.246|178.76.165.246]] ([[User talk:178.76.165.246|talk]]) 05:50, 8 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

[[:2d Stryker Cavalry Regiment]] → {{no redirect|2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)}} – The current name of the unit; Stryker has been dropped from its name, and 2nd is the correct format. &amp;mdash;[[User talk:Innotata|''innotata'']] 18:30, 22 July 2014 (UTC)
'''Support''' rename. The original change, IMO, was shortsighted. [[User:Intothatdarkness|Intothat]][[User_talk:Intothatdarkness|darkness]] 20:45, 23 July 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' &amp;ndash; I am not so sure that ''2nd is the correct format'' is in fact correct.  My understanding is that the standard US Army usage would be ''2d'' (and ''3d'' &amp;ndash; see [[3d Cavalry Regiment]]).  Note the usage on the [http://www.army.mil/2cr official site].  [[User:Hamish59|Hamish59]] ([[User talk:Hamish59|talk]]) 21:30, 23 July 2014 (UTC)
*Support. &lt;u&gt;I think [[WP:ENGVAR]] guides us to use the US &quot;2d&quot;, but otherwise&lt;/u&gt; I support this move, see my additional comments below. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 00:41, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
**&quot;2d&quot; is ''not'' standard usage in the U.S.! It's just widespread in the military, and probably only recently; I've never seen any other articles on military units that use this shortened form of ordinal. I don't care myself, but I think I'll ask someone who might know/care. &amp;mdash;[[User talk:Innotata|''innotata'']] 01:07, 24 July 2014 (UTC)

****@[[User:Hamish59|Hamish59]] Yeah, I was replying to [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]. I don't want anyone to think that it's an American English issue ;) As far as your point, it doesn't look standard, according to the below comment. &amp;mdash;[[User talk:Innotata|''innotata'']] 19:50, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
*****@[[User:Innotata|''innotata'']], no worries.  [[User:Hamish59|Hamish59]] ([[User talk:Hamish59|talk]]) 20:19, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
******I'd be happier with one ordinal system on en WP rather than two. There are a lot of US Milhist articles using &quot;2d&quot;, but as far as this one is concerned, let's go with &quot;2nd&quot;. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 01:00, 25 July 2014 (UTC)
***'''Support''' rename - In the U.S. Army and Air Force 2d and 3d are fairly common, but they are not terribly consistent. Look at the unit's home page which [[User:Hamish59|Hamish59]] linked to above. They use &quot;2D&quot; five times, &quot;2ND&quot; once and &quot;2nd&quot; once, other places on their web page, they spell out &quot;Second&quot; and often they refer to themselves as &quot;2CR&quot;. Since they don't insist on consistency, I think we could say that on Wikipedia, we will use the standard English language ordinals which will be understood by the most people. &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#B7D9F9;padding:0px 3px;border-radius:3px&quot;&gt;[[User:SchreiberBike|SchreiberBike]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;border-left:1px solid #0E5CA4;padding-left:3px&quot;&gt;[[User talk:SchreiberBike|talk]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 02:49, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
