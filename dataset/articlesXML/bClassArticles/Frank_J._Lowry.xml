[[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] '''Frank Jacob Lowry''' (15 February 1888 – 26 March 1955) was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] who served in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. A 1911 graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy]], he served on  submarines during World War I. During World War II, he commanded the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|6}} at the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], for which he was awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], and the [[Battle of Midway]]. He commanded the VIII Amphibious Force in the landings at [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]] and [[Operation Dragoon|Southern France]]. He retired from the Navy in March 1950, and received a [[tombstone promotion]] to vice admiral due to his combat decorations.

== Early life ==
Frank Jacob Lowry was born in [[Cresco, Iowa]], on 1 February 1888.{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=572}} In 1907, he was appointed to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis]], from which he graduated in 1911. He was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in 1914. He served on submarines, starting with duty on the [[submarine tender]] {{USS|Alert|AS-4|6}} in 1914. He became a [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] in 1915, and a [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] in 1916. In 1917, he was posted to the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Raleigh|C-8}}. The following year he was transferred to the {{USS|Pittsburgh|CA-4|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://navy.togetherweserved.com/usn/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&amp;type=Person&amp;ID=530336 |title=Vice Admiral Frank Jacob Lowry |publisher= Togetherweserved.com Inc |accessdate=26 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he saw duty at the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]].  He commanded the cargo ship {{USS|Pensacola|AK-7|6}} from 1922 until 1925, after which he was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]]. In 1925, he entered the [[Naval War College]], from which he graduated in May 1926. After service on the [[battleship]] {{USS|California|BB-44|6}} from 1926 to 1928, he became a professor of naval science and tactics at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], with the rank of [[commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=572}}

Following the usual pattern of alternating duty ashore with service at sea, he commanded the destroyer {{USS|Hale|DD-133|6}} from 1931 to 1933, then served as a training officer at the [[Naval Training Center San Diego]]. He saw sea duty again as executive officer of the cruiser {{USS|Tuscaloosa|CA-37|6}} from 1936 to 1938, after which he was promoted to [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]]. He was then assigned to the officer personnel division of the [[Bureau of Navigation]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], from March 1938 to September 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=572}}{{sfn|Morison|1954|p=325}}

== World War II ==
=== Coral Sea and Midway ===
In October 1942, Lowry assumed command of the cruiser {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|6}}. He was its captain during the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], for which he was awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]. His citation read:{{quote|The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Captain Frank Jacob Lowry, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line of his profession as Commanding Officer of the Heavy Cruiser U.S.S. Minneapolis (CA-36), during operations in Coral Sea on 7 and 8 May 1942. Under Captain Lowry's skillful direction, his ship during this action inflicted considerable damage on the enemy Japanese and rendered vital protection to the aircraft carrier to which it was assigned. Captain Lowry's inspiring leadership and the valiant devotion to duty of his command contributed in large measure to the outstanding success of these vital missions and reflect great credit upon the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=20645 |title=Valor Awards for Frank Jacob Lowry |publisher=[[Military Times]] |accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As part of Rear Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]]'s cruiser group, Lowry's ''Minneapolis'' helped protect the [[aircraft carrier]]s {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} and {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} at the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942.{{sfn|Morison|1949|p=91}}

=== Mediterranean Sea ===
Promoted to rear admiral in August 1942, Lowry became executive officer of the [[Naval Station Great Lakes]] in November 1942, and subsequently its commander. In February 1943, he became commander of the [[Moroccan Sea Frontier]]. He was succeeded Rear Admiral [[Richard L. Conolly]] as Commander, Landing Craft and Base, North African Waters (COMLANDCRABNAW) on 16 September 1943. On 8 November, he succeeded Rear Admiral [[John L. Hall, Jr.]], as commander of the VIII Amphibious Force.{{sfn|Morison|1954|p=325}}{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=572}} He directed the [[Operation Shingle|landing at Anzio]] in January 1944 from his flagship, the command ship {{USS|Biscayne|AVP-11|6}}.{{sfn|Morison|1954|pp=329-334}} The Army commander, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[John P. Lucas]], opined that &quot;the work of the Navy under his [Lowry's] direction has been one of the outstanding achievements of the operation.&quot;{{sfn|Morison|1954|p=359}}

For [[Operation Dragoon]], the landings of southern France in August 1944, Lowry commanded Task Force 84, also known as Alpha Force, which transported and Major General [[John W. O'Daniel]]'s [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Morison|1957|pp=237, 339}} This time he flew his flag from the [[United States Coast Guard]] [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{USCGC|Duane|WPG-33|6}}. The operation went smoothly, allowing O'Daniel and his staff to go ashore from ''Duanne'' at 10:44, six hours after the first wave.{{sfn|Morison|1957|pp=258-264}} Lowry subsequently commanded an amphibious group with the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]].{{sfn|Morison|1954|p=325}} For his services in World War II, in addition to the Navy Cross, he received the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], twice received [[Legion of Merit]] and was awarded the [[Navy Commendation Medal]].{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=572}}

== Later life ==
After the war, Lowry served on the [[General Board of the United States Navy|General Board]] from 1945 to 1947, and then in the office of the [[Vice Chief of Naval Operations]]. He served in this capacity until he retired in March 1950, at which point he received a [[tombstone promotion]] to vice admiral due to his combat decorations. He died on 26 March 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=572}}
