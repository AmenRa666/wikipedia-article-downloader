This is a partial list of accidents and incidents involving the Boeing-designed [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]. Combat losses are not included except for a very few cases denoted by singular circumstances. A few documented drone attrition cases are also included.

Aircraft were constructed by a three firm consortium, Boeing, Vega and Douglas, known by the acronym BVD. Boeing built airframes at their plant in [[Seattle, Washington]] and their production models were appended -BO. [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] constructed airframes at [[Long Beach, California]] with a -DL suffix. The [[Vega Aircraft Corporation]], a subsidiary of the [[Lockheed Aircraft Company]], at [[Burbank, California]], delivered airframes with the -VE suffix.
