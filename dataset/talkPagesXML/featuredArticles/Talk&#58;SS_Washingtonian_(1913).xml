The result of the proposal was '''No move'''. There's a rough consensus that disambiguation is unnecessary unless and until other articles are created that make this title ambiguous.[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt;]] 14:16, 1 June 2012 (UTC)

[[SS Washingtonian]] → [[SS Washingtonian (1913)]] – There were other ships named ''Washingtonian'', including one launched in 1919 that was involved in a collision with {{USS|Henley|DD-391}} in 1938. Thus the current title should be a shipindex page. This ''should'' be an uncontroversial request, but as it affects a featured article I'm bringing it here for discussion. &lt;small&gt; ''relisted'' --[[User:Mike Cline|Mike Cline]] ([[User talk:Mike Cline|talk]]) 15:46, 23 May 2012 (UTC) &lt;/small&gt; [[User:Mjroots|Mjroots]] ([[User talk:Mjroots|talk]]) 06:55, 15 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' conversion to a shipindex. (Perhaps by redirecting to a [[Washingtonian (ship)]] article) [[Special:Contributions/70.24.251.208|70.24.251.208]] ([[User talk:70.24.251.208|talk]]) 05:27, 16 May 2012 (UTC)
**That redirect would suggest a [[full-rigged ship]] named ''Washingtonian''. [[User:Mjroots|Mjroots]] ([[User talk:Mjroots|talk]]) 08:11, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
***No, [[Washingtonian (ship)]] would be any kind of ship whatsoever, since many articles on Wikipedia disambiguated with &quot;(ship)&quot; are not fully rigged ships of any sort. So, such a title for the shipindex would allow inclusion of more types of ships, not just screw steamers. [[Special:Contributions/70.24.251.208|70.24.251.208]] ([[User talk:70.24.251.208|talk]]) 04:53, 21 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''', no other article to make this title ambiguous. Hatnote can direct to the Henley, if needed. The proposed ship index article needn't be placed at the base name. It could be titled &quot;List of ships named SS ''Washington''&quot;, for example. -- [[User:JHunterJ|JHunterJ]] ([[User talk:JHunterJ|talk]]) 13:57, 23 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' as this move deals with purely hypothetical articles which have not been created yet.  If someone creates an article about any other ship called SS Washington then we can judge its notability, encyclopedic merit etc.. [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 20:27, 23 May 2012 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' It is not a requirement of [[WP:SHIPS]] to have all bluelinks in a shipindex page. Shipindex pages ''may be created'' once it becomes apparent that there is a need for one, although I would not support a shipindex page consisting entirely of redlinks. The other ''Washingtonian'' falls within the project scope of WP:SHIPS (in excess of 100'/100 tons) and is highly likely to be notable enough to sustain an article. [[User:Mjroots|Mjroots]] ([[User talk:Mjroots|talk]]) 06:07, 24 May 2012 (UTC)
***'''Reply''' Firstly, &quot;highly likely to be notable enough to sustain an article&quot; is not quite sufficient, we need to see this article to be sure, and since nobody has yet created this hypothetical article this creates an element of doubt.  Secondly, even with it, we might decide that this ship is still the primary meaning. [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 16:14, 24 May 2012 (UTC)

== What? ==

A collision with a wooden schooner sank a 7,000 ton steel freighter in a few minutes?  How did that happen?  Was there an enquiry?  More information is needed to make sense of this.  [[User:Peter Bell|Peter Bell]] ([[User talk:Peter Bell|talk]]) 13:45, 27 July 2016 (UTC)

:This schooner was not some little sailing boat--it was a five-masted monster nearly as long as ''Washingtonian'' and probably a few thousand tons in weight itself. (Supposedly the schooner's tonnage (not a weight in tons) was 3,065 grt.) Such a huge wooden ship would no doubt be quite sturdily built. And this massive schooner drove into ''Washingtonian's'' side, not the other way around. It's not surprising that a steel freighter of that era could be fatally holed by such a collision, even though it also proved fatal to the schooner. Considering the economic consequences, I'm sure there was an enquiry, but I'd guess it would have concentrated on how the ships ended up colliding in the first place.--[[User:Colin Douglas Howell|Colin Douglas Howell]] ([[User talk:Colin Douglas Howell|talk]]) 20:16, 27 July 2016 (UTC)

== Value of the freight is nearer to $650.000, not $1.000.000 ??? ==

The estimation of a &quot;$1,000,000 cargo of 10,000 long tons of raw Hawaiian sugar&quot; seems a bit off to me.
 
10.000 long tons = 10.200 metric tons = 10.200.000 kg 

Valued at the (pre-sinking) price of 6.39 cents per kg, the value of the sugar would have been

10.200.000 kg * 0.0639 $/kg = 651.780 $

That is not really a $1.000.000 cargo, except maybe for the tabloids of the time ;-)  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.183.94.230|213.183.94.230]] ([[User talk:213.183.94.230|talk]]) 14:39, 27 July 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
