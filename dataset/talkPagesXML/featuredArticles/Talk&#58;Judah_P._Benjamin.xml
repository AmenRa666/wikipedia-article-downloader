== Acting president ==

Is there any contemporary evidence that Benjamin was ever acting president? The statement that &quot;Evans suggests that Benjamin's actions made him the Confederacy's acting president&quot; seems totally implausible. Chairing a cabinet meeting does not make one acting president.[[User:Royalcourtier|Royalcourtier]] ([[User talk:Royalcourtier|talk]]) 04:33, 21 February 2015 (UTC)
:It's being presented as the opinion of the writer of the source, Evans. But it seems plausible enough.  With the VP, Stephens, not trusted by Davis (and the VP as cabinet member is definitely 20th century), Benjamin was the senior Executive Branch official and Davis was in Tennessee and not fully in touch all the time. The fact remains he did kick out the British consuls, which is a significant policy change, before Davis knew. And, someone's got to run the war--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 06:17, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

== Was David Levy (Yulee) or Judah Benjamin the first Jew elected to the U.S. Senate? ==

First, it appears that David Levy (Yulee) converted from Judaism to Christianity after he began serving in the U.S. Senate. He became a Senator in 1845 and converted to Christianity in 1846 when he married Nannie C. Wickliffe, who was Christian, and changed his name adding &quot;Yulee&quot; as a surname. This would make Judah Benjamin the second Jew to serve in the U.S. Senate, not the first. This makes sense and today converting from Religion X to Religion Y in America upon the request (or demand) of a soon-to-be spouse remains a very common reason for converting -- offering an inconclusive but rational explanation for this timing. A footnote on Yulee's Wikipedia page says, &quot;It is not clear if Yulee converted before his marriage to Nancy Christian Wickliffe or on his deathbed. Nor is the documentary evidence clear if he was seated in the U.S. before or after his reported conversion to Christianity.&quot;

Second, the &quot;profess&quot; wording is wiggly, wormy and weaselly. Many U.S. politicians don't &quot;profess&quot; anything and we certainly do not officially monitor what they &quot;profess&quot; down to the day. It is unhelpful regarding what most people want to know to ignore David Levy Yulee by claiming that Judah Benjamin was the first person to &quot;profess&quot;... whatever. Yulee was born a Jew and some would even argue this is something one cannot escape out of. Nevertheless, going with the &quot;self-identifying&quot; allowance to permit people to identify how they want, the burden would be on wiki-authors who wish to assert that he self-identified out of Judaism to document this given that he was born Jewish. The footnote above suggests no such documentary evidence exists.

Third, the scope of &quot;cabinet member&quot; should be &quot;U.S.&quot; and not &quot;North America&quot; because the former is a political subdivision having cabinet members while the latter is not.

:This is in support of the text, &quot;Benjamin was the second Jew to be elected to the United States Senate, and the first to hold a cabinet position in the United States&quot; or perhaps that should be &quot;serve in the United States Senate&quot; [[User:Gluten is a tent test|Gluten is a tent test]] ([[User talk:Gluten is a tent test|talk]]) 23:31, 30 August 2015 (UTC)</text>
