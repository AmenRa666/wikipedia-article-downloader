'''USS ''LST-473''''' was a U.S. Navy amphibious warship, a {{sclass|LST-1|tank landing ship}}, that saw action during [[World War II]].

LST-473 was laid down on 10 July 1942 at [[Kaiser Steel|Kaiser Inc.]] [[Vancouver, Washington]] and launched on 9 December 1942. She was commissioned on 16 March 1943.

== Service history ==
During World War II, LST-473 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific theater and participated in the following operations: the landings at [[Lae]] (September 1943); the landings at [[Leyte]] (October 1944); the landings at [[Lingayen Gulf]] (January 1945); the [[Zambales]]-[[Subic Bay]] operations (January 1945) and landings at [[Mindanao Island]] (April 1945).

″On September 4, 1943, the USS LST 473 was operating  as part of General Douglas MacArthur's VII Amphibious Force off the eastern coast of New Guinea. Allied forces were &quot;leap-frogging&quot; around Japanese strongholds in an attempt to isolate and neutralize them.  LST 473 was one of six LSTs and four destroyers on their way to reinforce an Australian assault force east of Lae when they were attacked by 12 Japanese torpedo planes and 15 dive bombers.  During the air attack, a Japanese torpedo plane launched 2 torpedoes toward LST 473.  Before the helmsman could react and maneuver the ship clear, 2 bombs hit the upper deck and quickly engulfed the pilot house in flames.  Although mortally wounded by the bombs, Seaman First Class [[Johnnie David Hutchins]] grabbed the helm and steered the ship out of the path of the torpedoes.   He died clinging to the helm,  giving his last ounce of strength to save his shipmates.  He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.  For valor and courage above and  beyond the call of duty, Seaman First Class Hutchins was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.

7 other crew members were killed in action  and another 14 were wounded in this attack.  In addition to the Medal of Honor, the Navy Cross was awarded to [http://www.homeofheroes.com/members/02_NX/citations/03_wwii-nc/nc_06wwii_navyE.html S1c Frederick L. Erickson] of Iowa, the Silver Star was awarded to  Ensign J. K. Hayes, of Missouri and CPhM Nelson Tudor, of Kentucky.  Ensign J. W. Triplitt, of Texas, F1c Sylvester L. Modglin, of Missouri and Eddie A. Huntsman, of Texas  received a Letter of Commendation.  LST 473 survived  this  attack  but was  without power.  The destroyer USS Conyngham(DD 371) valiantly went to her aid.  She helped her with her dead and wounded and circled her  all night  to protect her  from  enemy subs.  The USS LST 454 also heroically assisted her.  The 454 tied the 473 to her side and towed her to Morobe Bay, New Guinea where the troops and cargo onboard were taken off.  LST 473's dead  were then  buried just outside Morobe Bay.  The 473 and  LST 471(also damaged  in the attack) were towed to Australia for repairs.  It took one year to repair  LST 473.  She  then returned  to combat in  the Pacific Theater.  She  went on  to  fight in  four other major  engagements:  Leyte  landings, Lingayen Gulf landings, Zambales-Subic Bay and the Mindanao Island landings.″&lt;ref&gt;http://lst494.freeyellow.com/Medal_of_Honor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

LST-473 returned to the United States and was decommissioned on 18 March 1946. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 17 April, before being sold on 21 April 1948 to Hughes Bros Inc, New York for scrap.

LST 473's crew was awarded more decorations for individual heroism than any other LST crew that saw action in World War II. LST-473 earned five [[battle star]]s for her gallant service in World War II.
