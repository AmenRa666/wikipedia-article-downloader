'''Greenmount War Memorial''' is a heritage-listed [[memorial]] at Ramsay Street, [[Greenmount, Queensland (Toowoomba Region)|Greenmount]], [[Toowoomba Region]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It was built from 1921 to 1986.  It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992.&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|15165|Greenmount War Memorial|600390|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Greenmount War Memorial was erected {{circa|1921}}, originally located near the railway station in [[Pilton, Queensland|Pilton]] Street, the main road between [[Toowoomba]] and [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]].  The mason for the monument was William Parkin Prout of Warwick, who was also responsible for monuments in [[Allora, Queensland|Allora]] and [[Killarney, Queensland|Killarney]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Greenmount was one of a number of small localities which developed as farming areas when portions of the [[Eton Vale]], Felton and Pilton pastoral estates were resumed by the Government for closer settlement from the late 1860s to the 1880s.  Greenmount developed as a township centred on the Greenmount railway station and local store, and grew during the early 1900s. Although the newly formed [[Shire of Cambooya|Cambooya Shire Council]] decided to erect an Honour Roll for the soldiers of the area in 1915, it was not until January 1921 that the Council decided the money raised should go towards the erection of the Shire memorial at Greenmount.  No completion date for the memorial was recorded, however in 1922 the Council expressed its gratitude to the ladies of Greenmount and district for the supervision and care of the memorial.  Records show that a memorial in the form of an obelisk was also constructed in [[Cambooya, Queensland|Cambooya]] {{circa|1921}}.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In August 1952 the Council took over the trusteeship of the monument from the Greenmount Progress Association.  It was also around this time that the Council donated money towards having the names of [[World War II|Second World War]] servicemen included on the monument.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1985 the Greenmount Bicentennial Memorial Park was established in Ramsay Street adjoining the Returned Soldiers Hall.  The monument, which is believed to be the only intact [[Digger (soldier)|digger]] monument by Prout in Queensland, was re-sited in the park which was officially opened in February 1986.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Description ==
The Greenmount War Memorial ({{circa|1921}}) consists of a &quot;[[Digger (soldier)|Digger]]&quot; monument centrally located in a memorial park ({{circa|1985}}) which slopes gently to the west.  The monument comprises a lifesize grey sandstone Digger statue surmounting a tall, finely carved sandstone blocked [[pedestal]] which is about twice the height of the statue.  It is encircled with garden beds, shrubs and small palms, and is impressively set against the backdrop of the adjacent valley and hills.  A tall steel flagstaff is located to the west of the monument.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The monument rests on a concrete platform encircled with small sandstone [[newel]]s and a steel rail. The stepped sandstone base has a sloping face to the north which bears a leaded marble plaque, and is inscribed with the mason's name.  The lower portion of the pedestal has leaded marble honour rolls on each face, and a floriated [[cornice]]. The upper portion has curved panels in relief bearing small marble &quot;in memoriam&quot; plaques, surmounted by a white sandstone tapering block with wreaths and crossed guns in relief. This section is topped with a small [[pediment]] and steps, upon which the statue is mounted.  The grey sandstone Digger statue faces the road, standing with his right foot forward, holding the top of the rifle barrel in his right hand.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The monument in its park setting with a backdrop of hills and valley makes a strong aesthetic contribution to the Greenmount townscape, and is in very good condition.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
