[[File:Lona Cohen on Russian stamp.jpg|thumb|upright|Leontina Cohen on a Russian stamp]]
'''Leontine Theresa &quot;Lona&quot; Petka Cohen'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cornwell |first=Rupert |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/physicist-accused-of-being-spy-for-stalin-1321177.html |title=Physicist accused of being spy for Stalin |work=The Independent |date=February 26, 1996 |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (January 11, 1913 – December 23, 1992), also known while she was in [[London]] as '''Helen Kroger''', was an [[United States|American]] [[espionage|spy]] for the [[Soviet Union]]. She was the wife of another spy, [[Morris Cohen (Soviet spy)|Morris Cohen]].

== Espionage ==
Lona Cohen was '''Leontine Theresa Petka''' in [[Adams, Massachusetts]], the daughter of Polish Catholic immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=TrlRaHFHspsC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22Lona+Petka+Cohen%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAWoVChMIqYettdTIyAIVCzw-Ch375Qfz]&lt;/ref&gt; An [[United States|American]] citizen, she was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] and had been recruited into Soviet espionage in 1939 by her husband, [[Morris Cohen (Soviet spy)|Morris]]. She worked for Soviet case officers, including [[Anatoli Yatskov]], out of the New York ''[[Resident spy|rezidentura]]'' during [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

After her husband was [[conscription|drafted]] in 1942, Cohen ran a network that included [[engineer]]s and [[technician]]s at munitions and [[aviation]] plants in the [[New York (state)|New York]] area. One of her sources smuggled a working model of a new machine gun out of a munition plant. She worked at two defense plants, the Public Metal Company in [[New York City]] in 1941 and the Aircraft Screw Products plant on [[Long Island]] in 1943.

She was a courier who picked up reports from [[Theodore Hall]], and a source [[Code name|cover name]]d &quot;FOGEL&quot; and &quot;PERS&quot; from the American secret [[atomic weapons]] project at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory#History|Los Alamos]], [[New Mexico]] and carried them to the Soviet consulate in New York, where a [[KGB]] sub-residency under a young engineer, [[Leonid R. Kvasnikov]], coordinated operations and dispatched intelligence to [[Moscow]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

After the defections of [[Elizabeth Bentley]] and [[Igor Gouzenko]], the Cohens ended contact with Soviet intelligence until 1949, at which time they began working with Col. [[Rudolph Abel]], a U.S. based [[illegal resident]]. After [[Klaus Fuchs]] was arrested in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1950, Cohen and her husband fled to [[Moscow]], where she received additional training as a [[radio]] operator and [[cipher]] clerk. In 1954, the pair resurfaced in [[London]] under the names Helen and Peter Kroger with [[New Zealand]] [[passport]]s. They set up an antiquarian book business which was cover for their activities of running the London Illegal Rezidentura. [[Gordon Lonsdale]] worked with them as part of the [[Portland Spy Ring]].

Whilst in London, the Cohens were friends with Frank and Nora Doel. [[Frank Doel]] is the bookseller whose correspondence with the author [[Helene Hanff]] became the bestseller, ''[[84 Charing Cross Road]]''. In her follow-up book, ''The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street'', Hanff reported an anecdote told her by Nora Doel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanff |first=Helene |title=The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street |year=1976 |publisher=Avon |isbn=0-380-00634-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[New Year's Eve]], the Doels gave a party at which Lona Cohen (aka Helen Kroger)

&lt;blockquote&gt;arrived looking very exotic in a long black evening dress. 'Helen, you look like a Russian spy!' said Nora. And Helen laughed and Peter laughed and a few months later Nora picked up the morning paper and discovered that Helen and Peter Kruger ''were'' Russian spies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Imprisonment ==
[[File:Cranley Drive, Ruislip - geograph.org.uk - 306570.jpg|thumb|The Cohens’ house in Ruislip was found to be full of transmitting equipment]]
In the basement of their house, at 45 Cranley Drive, Ruislip, situated not far from the military airfield of [[Northolt]], they set up a high speed radio transmitter and began sending Moscow “information of special importance”. In January 1961, they were arrested for espionage, and in March, she received a sentence of 20 years while her husband got 25 years, of which they served only eight, until in 1969, the two were finally exchanged with the Soviet Union for a British subject called [[Gerald Brooke]]. Once in [[Moscow]], they continued training colleagues for illegal intelligence operations.

Before being taken in custody, Mrs. Kroger had asked permission to stoke up the boiler. Before she could do so, Detective Superintendent Smith, a veteran “spy catcher” who was in charge of the arrest, insisted on checking her handbag first. It was found to contain microdots, the photographic reduction of documents, in order to make them small enough to be smuggled out of the country more easily.

== Later life ==
Lona Cohen was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] and [[Order of Friendship of Peoples|Order of Friendship of Nations]] by the Soviet Union.

== Fictional portrayals ==
In 1983, British playwright [[Hugh Whitemore]] dramatized the case as ''[[Pack of Lies]]'', which was performed in London’s [[West End theatre]] district starring [[Judi Dench]] and [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]]. It played on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] for 3½ months in 1985, for which [[Rosemary Harris]] won the best actress [[Tony award]] for her portrayal of the British neighbor of the Cohens (&quot;Krogers&quot;).

It was made into a TV movie starring [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Alan Bates]] and [[Teri Garr]] (the last playing &quot;Helen Schaefer&quot;, i.e., &quot;Helen Kroger&quot;, i.e., Lona Cohen) which aired in the U.S. as a [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] presentation in 1987 on [[CBS]]. The story centred on the seemingly pleasant and ordinary neighbours and friends, the [[Search family]], whose home was eventually used as a base to spy on the Schaefers (i.e. &quot;Krogers&quot;).
