The '''Yugoslav submarine ''Nebojša''''' was the second of the [[Hrabri-class submarine|''Hrabri''-class]] [[diesel-electric]] [[submarine]]s built by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard]] on the [[River Tyne]] in the [[United Kingdom]], for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) and was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] in 1927. Her design was based on that of the [[British L-class submarine]] of [[World War I]], and she was built using parts originally assembled for a [[Royal Navy]] L-class submarine that was never built. She was armed with six bow-mounted {{convert|533|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[torpedo tubes]], two {{convert|102|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} guns and one [[machine gun]], and could dive to {{convert|60|m|ft}}.

Prior to [[World War II]] ''Nebojša'' participated in cruises to several [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] ports. During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, she evaded capture by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian forces]], and joined British naval forces in the Mediterranean where she performed a training role. After the war she was taken over by the new Yugoslav government and renamed '''''Tara'''''. She was eventually [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|stricken]] in 1954, and [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1958.

==Description and construction==
Yugoslav naval policy in the [[interwar period]] lacked direction until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=732}} although it was generally accepted that the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of [[submarine]]s, coastal [[torpedo boat]]s, [[torpedo bomber]]s and conventional [[bomber]] aircraft to perform this role. The [[Hrabri-class submarine|''Hrabri''-class]] submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=779}}

''Nebojša'' (Fearless) was built in 1927 for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard]] on the [[River Tyne]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} Her design was based on that of the [[British L-class submarine]] of [[World War I]], and she was built using parts originally assembled for HMS ''L-68'', which was never completed.{{sfn|Akermann|2002|p=168}} Along with her [[sister ship|sister submarine]] ''[[Yugoslav submarine Hrabri|Hrabri]]'', she had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|72.05|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|7.32|m|ftin|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, and a surfaced [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|3.96|m|ftin|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. Her surfaced [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|975|LT}} or {{convert|1164|LT}} submerged, and her crew consisted of 45 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} She had an operational depth of {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=171}}

The ''Hrabri''-class had two shafts driven by two [[diesel engine]]s (when surfaced) or two electric motors (when submerged). Their diesel engines were rated at {{convert|2400|bhp|lk=in}} and the electric motors at {{convert|1600|shp|lk=in}}, and they were designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|15.7|kn|lk=in}} under diesel power while surfaced, and {{convert|10|kn}} on their electric motors when submerged. They were armed with six bow-mounted {{convert|533|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[torpedo tubes]], and carried twelve torpedoes.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=148}} They were also equipped with two {{convert|102|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} [[deck gun]]s (one forward and one [[aft]] of the [[conning tower]]), and one [[machine gun]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} Their radius of action was {{convert|3800|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.{{sfn|Akermann|2002|p=166}}

==Service career==
''Nebojša'' was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] in 1927 as the second submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which later became the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} Along with her sister submarine ''Hrabri'', she left the Tyne in late January 1928.{{sfn|Hood|1928|p=154}} In company with the Yugoslav [[submarine tender]] {{ship|Yugoslav submarine tender|Hvar||2}}, the two submarines arrived in the [[Bay of Kotor]]  on the southern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast on 8 April 1928.{{sfn|Luković|6 April 2013}} In May and June 1929, ''Hrabri'', ''Nebojša'', ''Hvar'' and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'' on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the [[Ionian Sea]], and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. The British naval [[attaché]] observed that the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} On 16 May 1930, ''Nebojša'' was exercising her crew at periscope depth near the entrance to the Bay of Kotor when she collided with a Yugoslav [[steamship]]. The damage was not serious and there were no injuries, but her forward 102&amp;nbsp;mm gun was lost overboard. The necessary repairs were carried out at the dockyard in the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=247}}

In June and July 1930, ''Hrabri'', ''Nebojša'' and the fleet auxiliary ''Sitnica'' again cruised the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], visiting [[Alexandria]] and [[Beirut]].{{sfn|Radio Tivat|9 July 2014}} In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}} In September 1933, ''Nebojša'' and the submarine [[Yugoslav submarine Osvetnik|''Osvetnik'']] cruised the southern part of the central Mediterranean.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=453}} In August 1936, ''Nebojša'' and ''Osvetnik'' visited the Greek island of Corfu.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=738}}

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, she and two [[Orjen-class torpedo boat|''Orjen''-class]] [[motor torpedo boat]]s evaded capture by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian forces]] at the Bay of Kotor, arriving at [[Souda Bay|Suda Bay]], [[Crete]], on 23 April,{{sfn|Willmott|2010|p=311}} after eight days at sea.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=295}} Despite this, the Italians claimed that they had sunk all the Yugoslav vessels.{{sfn|The Ottawa Journal|1941|p=17}} ''Nebojša'' then sailed to Alexandria, but the [[Royal Navy]] considered her unfit for combat duties. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] suggested her crew might be retrained and used to operate the recently captured German [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC|Type VIIC U-boat]] ''[[HMS Graph|U-570]]'', but this idea was soon abandoned.{{sfn|Blair|1996|p=233}} She was based at [[Valletta]] in Malta as an [[anti-submarine warfare]] training vessel,{{sfn|Večernje Novosti|21 March 2011}} serving with the [[British 2nd Submarine Flotilla]] in 1942 and the [[British 3rd Submarine Flotilla]] in 1943.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} She continued working in the Mediterranean until the end of the war,{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=251}} but her service with the Royal Navy appears to have been limited to a training role.{{sfn|Thomas|1991|p=35}}

After the war she was towed first to [[Bari]] in Italy, then in August 1945 to the port of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] where she was overhauled, renamed ''Tara'' and given the [[pennant number]] 801. She was then transferred to [[Pula]] on the [[Istria]]n peninsula in the northern Adriatic. Used to train the fledgling [[Yugoslav Navy]] submarine arm,{{sfn|Večernje Novosti|21 March 2011}} she was [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|stricken]] in 1954.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=148}} One of her guns was removed at the end of her career,{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}} and she was eventually [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1958.{{sfn|Jane's Publishing|1963|p=444}}

==Legacy==
In 2011, to mark the 70th anniversary of the invasion of Yugoslavia, the [[Military Museum (Belgrade)|Military Museum]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] hosted an exhibit which included a flag from the ''Nebojša''.{{sfn|Blic online|6 April 2011}} In April 2013, the 85th anniversary of the arrival of the first Yugoslav submarines at the Bay of Kotor was marked by an event in [[Tivat]], [[Montenegro]], attended by dozens of former Yugoslav submariners.{{sfn|Luković|6 April 2013}}
