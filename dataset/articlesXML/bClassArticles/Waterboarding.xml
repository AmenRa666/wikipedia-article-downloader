'''Waterboarding''' is a form of [[water torture]] in which water is poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of [[drowning]]. Waterboarding can cause extreme pain, [[dry drowning]], damage to [[lungs]], [[brain damage]] from [[oxygen deprivation]], other physical injuries including [[bone fracture|broken bones]] due to struggling against restraints, lasting psychological damage, and death.&lt;ref name='HRW open letter WB'&gt;{{cite web

In the most common method of waterboarding, the captive's face is covered with cloth or some other thin material, and the subject is immobilized on their back at an incline of 10 to 20 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quit-torture-now.org/static/media/uploads/waterboard.gif&lt;/ref&gt; Torturers pour water onto the face over the breathing passages, causing an almost immediate [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] and creating a drowning sensation for the captive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Vomitus travels up the esophagus, which may then be inhaled. Victims of waterboarding are at extreme risk of sudden death due to the [[pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] of vomitus.

In August 2002 and March 2003, in its [[war on terror]], the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]], through [[Jay S.

Five days before the March [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], [[John Yoo]], the acting Office of Legal Counsel, issued a fourth memo to the General Counsel of DOD, concluding his legal opinion by saying that federal laws related to torture and other abuse did not apply to interrogations overseas. The legal opinions were withdrawn by [[Jack Goldsmith]] of the OLC in June 2004 but reaffirmed by the succeeding head of the OLC in December 2004.&lt;ref name=WashPost20081015&gt;{{cite news

In 2006, the Bush administration banned torture including waterboarding on detainees. In January 2009, [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] issued a similar ban on the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture in interrogations of detainees. In April 2009, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] refused to say whether waterboarding is still used for training (e.g., [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|SERE]]) US military personnel in resistance to interrogation.&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{cite news

In December 2014, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued a declassified 500 page summary of its still classified 6,700 page report on the [[Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]] Detention and Interrogation Program.  The report concluded that &quot;the CIA's use of [[Enhanced Interrogation Techniques|enhanced interrogation techniques (EIT)]] was not effective for acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.&quot;  According to the report, the CIA had presented no credible proof that information obtained through waterboarding or the other harsh interrogation methods that the CIA employed prevented any attacks or saved any lives.  There was no evidence that information obtained from the detainees through EIT was not or could not have been obtained through conventional interrogation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Senate Select Committee on Intelligence |date=3 Dec 2014 |title=Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program |url=https://publicintelligence.net/senate-cia-torture-report/|publisher=United States Senate |page=|docket= |accessdate=28 Nov 2015 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Darius Rejali]] of [[Reed College]], author of ''[[Torture and Democracy]]'' (2007), speculates that the term waterboarding probably has its origin in the need for a [[euphemism]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There is a special vocabulary for torture. When people use tortures that are old, they rename them and alter them a wee bit. They invent slightly new words to mask the similarities. This creates an inside club, especially important in work where secrecy matters. Waterboarding is clearly a jailhouse joke. It refers to surfboarding&quot;– a word found as early as 1929– &quot;they are attaching somebody to a board and helping them surf. Torturers create names that are funny to them.&quot;&lt;ref name=Safire/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' first included the term in 2009: &quot;[A]n interrogation technique in which water is forced into a detainee's mouth and nose so as to induce the sensation of drowning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami-dade/breaking-news/story/1134305.html ''Miami Herald'' ] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Torture Memos}}
The United States' [[Office of Legal Counsel]] in August 2002 responded to the request by the CIA for a legal opinion regarding the use of certain interrogation techniques. It included the following account of the CIA's definition of waterboarding in a [[Bybee memo|Top Secret 2002 memorandum]] as follows:
{{Quote|In this procedure, the individual is bound securely to an inclined bench, which is approximately four feet by seven feet. The individual's feet are generally elevated. A cloth is placed over the forehead and eyes. Water is then applied to the cloth in a controlled manner. As this is done, the cloth is lowered until it covers both the nose and mouth. Once the cloth is saturated and completely covers the mouth and nose, air flow is slightly restricted for 20 to 40 seconds due to the presence of the cloth... During those 20 to 40 seconds, water is continuously applied from a height of twelve to twenty-four inches. After this period, the cloth is lifted, and the individual is allowed to breathe unimpeded for three or four full breaths... The procedure may then be repeated. The water is usually applied from a canteen cup or small watering can with a spout... You have... informed us that it is likely that this procedure would not last more than twenty minutes in any one application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Historically in the West, the technique is known to have been used in the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The suffocation of bound prisoners with water has been favored because, unlike most other torture techniques, it produces no marks on the body.&lt;ref name='NPR_WB_110307'&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; He was bound on a horizontal board with a black mask over his face. A group of men said to be highly trained in this tactic, who demanded anonymity, carried out the torture. Hitchens was strapped to the board at the chest and feet, face up, and unable to move. Metal objects were placed in each of his hands, which he could drop if feeling &quot;unbearable stress&quot;. The interrogator placed a towel over Hitchens' face, and poured water on it. After 16 seconds, Hitchens threw the metal objects to the floor and the torturers pulled the mask from his face, allowing him to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LPubUCJv58 Watch Christopher Hitchens get waterboarded (Vanity Fair)] at YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; In his article on the topic, he stated &quot;Well, then, if waterboarding does not constitute torture, then there is no such thing as torture.&quot;&lt;ref name = hitchvanity2008 /&gt;

==Mental and physical effects==
Dr. Allen Keller, the director of the [[Bellevue Hospital]]/[[New York University]] Program for Survivors of Torture, has treated &quot;a number of people&quot; who had been subjected to forms of near-asphyxiation, including waterboarding. In an interview for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', he argued that &quot;it was indeed torture. 'Some victims were still traumatized years later', he said. One patient couldn't take showers, and panicked when it rained. 'The fear of being killed is a terrifying experience', he said&quot;.&lt;ref name='NY'/&gt; Keller also gave a full description in 2007 in testimony before the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] on the practice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=Water-boarding or mock drowning, where a prisoner is bound to an inclined board and water is poured over their face, inducing a terrifying fear of drowning clearly can result in immediate and long-term health consequences. As the prisoner gags and chokes, the terror of imminent death is pervasive, with all of the physiologic and psychological responses expected, including an intense stress response, manifested by [[tachycardia]] (rapid heart beat) and gasping for breath. There is a real risk of death from actually [[drowning]] or suffering a [[heart attack]] or damage to the lungs from inhalation of water. Long term effects include [[panic attacks]], [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[PTSD]]. I remind you of the patient I described earlier who would panic and gasp for breath whenever it rained even years after his abuse.

The CIA's Office of Medical Services noted in a 2003 memo that &quot;for reasons of physical fatigue or psychological resignation, the subject may simply give up, allowing excessive filling of the airways and loss of consciousness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2010/03/09/waterboarding_for_dummies/index.html | title=Waterboarding for dummies | author=Mark Benjamin | quote=In our limited experience, extensive sustained use of the waterboard can introduce new risks, [...] Most seriously, for reasons of physical fatigue or psychological resignation, the subject may simply give up, allowing excessive filling of the airways and loss of consciousness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter in 2007 to [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]], [[Human Rights Watch]] asserted that waterboarding can cause the sort of &quot;severe pain&quot; prohibited by 18 [[U.S. code|USC]] 2340 (the implementation in the United States of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]]), that the psychological effects can last long after waterboarding ends (another of the criteria under 18 USC 2340), and that uninterrupted waterboarding can ultimately cause death.&lt;ref name='HRW open letter WB'/&gt;

===Description by U.S. media===

In covering the debate on the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique by the U.S. government, U.S. reporters had to decide whether to use the term &quot;torture&quot; or &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; to describe waterboarding. [[National Public Radio]]'s [[ombudsman]] detailed this debate and why NPR had decided to refrain from using the word torture to describe waterboarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Examining the four newspapers with the highest daily circulation in the country (''The New York Times'', ''The Los Angeles Times'', ''The Wall Street Journal'' and ''USA Today'') a student group of the [[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]] found a significant and sudden shift in how the newspapers characterized waterboarding from the early 1930s until the modern story broke in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100820063441/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/presspol/publications/papers/torture_at_times_hks_students.pdf ''Torture at Times: Waterboarding in the Media.''] Harvard Student Paper, April 2010.

===Spanish Inquisition===

A form of torture similar to waterboarding called ''toca'', and more recently &quot;Spanish water torture&quot;, to differentiate it from the better known [[Chinese water torture]], along with ''garrucha'' (or [[strappado]]) and the most frequently used ''potro'' (or the [[rack (torture)|rack]]). This was used infrequently during [[Spanish Inquisition#The trial|the trial portion of the Spanish Inquisition process]]. &quot;The ''toca'', also called ''tortura del agua'', consisted of introducing a cloth into the mouth of the victim, and forcing them to ingest water spilled from a jar so that they had the impression of drowning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George Ryley |last=Scott |title=The History of Torture Throughout the Ages |publisher=[[Kegan Paul]] |location=[[London]] |year=2004 |page=172 |isbn=0-7103-0837-X |oclc=51963457}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Schweiker claims that the use of water as a form of torture also had profound religious significance to the Inquisitors.&lt;ref name='UCHI_WB_112907'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6385.2008.00395.x |title=Torture and Religious Practice |date=Fall 2008 |first=William |last=Schweiker |journal=Dialog |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=208–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, waterboarding seemed to be very extended in the Spanish detention centers in the 1500s. Books from the time explain how to treat persons in custody, and used this &quot;light&quot; form of torture. After a specific way of beating, body, legs and arms, it was detailed how to pour 4 cuartillos (approx. 2.5 liters) of water over mouth and nose, with a covering cloth, making sure there was some cloth introduced in the mouth so water could also get in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.cervantes.es/literatura/clasicos/quijote/edicion/parte1/cap22/default.htm See complementary note of footnote 22 (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flemish Inquisition===

In [[Joos de Damhouder]]'s Praxis rerum criminalium (1554), a manual on the practice of criminal law, the chapter on torture and interrogation is illustrated with a woodcut of waterboarding, which it describes in detail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imgbase-scd-ulp.u-strasbg.fr/displayimage.php?album=713&amp;pos=106 Praxis rerum criminalium (1554), Chapter 37]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mennodiscuss.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=11699 Waterboarding in the Flemish Inquisition]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Martyr's Mirror]] depicts one incident of waterboarding used against the early Mennonites thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homecomers.org/mirror/martyrs151.htm|title=Raphel Van Den Velde And Jeronymus Schepens, And Other Persons, A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And as they did still not obtain anything from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I was at the end of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:amboyna.jpg|thumb|210px|Torture of the English by the Dutch according to the English account]]
Agents of the [[Dutch East India Company]] used a precursor to waterboarding during the [[Amboyna massacre]] of English prisoners, which took place on the island of [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]] in the [[Maluku Islands|Molucca Islands]] in 1623. At that time, it consisted of wrapping cloth around the victim's head, after which the torturers &quot;poured the water softly upon his head until the cloth was full, up to the mouth and nostrils, and somewhat higher, so that he could not draw breath but he must suck in all the water&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[East India Company]] |title=A true relation of the vniust, cruell, and barbarous proceedings against the English at Amboyna in the East-Indies |year=1624 |url=https://archive.org/details/trverelationofvn00east |location=[[London]] |publisher=H.

===American prisons before World War II===
An editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of 6 April 1852, and a subsequent 21 April 1852 letter to the editors documents an incidence of waterboarding, then called &quot;showering&quot; or &quot;hydropathic torture&quot;, in New York's [[Sing Sing]] prison of an inmate named Henry Hagan, who, after several other forms of beating and mistreatment, had his head shaved, and &quot;certainly three, and possibly a dozen, barrels of water were poured upon his naked scalp&quot;. Hagan was then placed in a yoke.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydt1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Extra-Judicial Punishments |date=6 April 1852 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9802E3D71331E234BC4E53DFB2668389649FDE |page=2 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correspondent listed only as &quot;H&quot; later wrote: &quot;Perhaps it would be well to state more fully the true character of this 'hydropathic torture.' The stream of water is about one inch in diameter, and falls from a {{sic|hi|ght}} of seven or eight feet. The head of the patient is retained in its place by means of a board clasping the neck; the effect of which is, that the water, striking upon the board, rebounds into the mouth and nostrils of the victim, almost producing strangulation. Congestion, sometimes of the heart or lungs, sometimes of the brain, not {{sic|un|frequently}} ensues; and death, in due season, has released some sufferers from the further ordeal of the water cure. As the water is administered officially, I suppose that it is not murder!&quot; H. then went on to cite an 1847 New York law which limited prison discipline to individual confinement &quot;upon a short allowance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nydt2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Prison Punishments—Showering |date=21 April 1852 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E0DE1531E13BBC4951DFB2668389649FDE |page=4 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisoners in late 19th-century Alabama, and in Mississippi in the first third of the 20th century, also suffered waterboarding. In Alabama, in lieu of or in addition to other physical punishment, a &quot;prisoner was strapped down on his back; then 'water [was] poured in his face on the upper lip, and effectually stop[ped] his breathing as long as there [was] a constant stream'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen Curtin, Black Prisoners and their World, Alabama, 1865–1900, at 69 (The University Press of Virginia 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In Mississippi, the accused was held down, and water was poured &quot;from a dipper into the nose so as to strangle him, thus causing pain and horror, for the purpose of forcing a confession.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Neil R. McMillen, Dark Journey: Black Mississippians in the Age of Jim Crow, at 213 (University of Illinois Press 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===By the U.S. in the Philippines after 1898===
[[File:Life 05-22-1902.JPG|thumb|1902 [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] cover, depicting water curing by U.S. troops in the Philippines]]
After the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898 in the [[Philippines]], the U.S. army used waterboarding, called the &quot;[[Water cure (torture)|water cure]]&quot; at the time. It is not clear where this practice came from; it probably was adopted from the Filipinos, who themselves adopted it from the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;p. 280, ''Torture and Democracy'', Darius Rejali, Princeton University Press, 2009, ISBN 0-691-14333-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of &quot;cruelties&quot; from soldiers stationed in the [[Philippines]] led to Senate hearings on U.S. activity there.

Testimony described the waterboarding of Tobeniano Ealdama &quot;while supervised by ...Captain/Major Edwin F. Glenn ([[Glenn Highway]])&quot;.&lt;ref name=kramer20080225&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Kramer |title=The Water Cure |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=25 February 2008 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/02/25/080225fa_fact_kramer |accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elihu Root]], [[United States Secretary of War]], ordered a [[court martial]] for Glenn in April 1902.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More Courts-Martial in the Philippines |date=16 April 1902 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9800E1D81230E733A25755C1A9629C946397D6CF |page=1 |accessdate=18 April 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, Glenn &quot;maintained that the torture of Ealdama was 'a legitimate exercise of force under the laws of war.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kramer20080225&quot; /&gt;

Though some reports seem to confuse Ealdama with Glenn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Tran |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/oct/27/usa.guantanamo |title=Cheney endorses simulated drowning |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2009 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn was found guilty and &quot;sentenced to a one-month suspension and a fifty-dollar fine&quot;, the leniency of the sentence due to the &quot;circumstances&quot; presented at the trial.&lt;ref name=kramer20080225/&gt;

President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] privately rationalized the instances of &quot;mild torture, the water cure&quot; but publicly called for efforts to &quot;prevent the occurrence of all such acts in the future&quot;. In that effort, he ordered the court-martial of General [[Jacob H. Smith]] on the island of [[Samar]], &quot;where some of the worst abuses had occurred&quot;. When the court-martial found only that he had acted with excessive zeal, Roosevelt disregarded the verdict and had the General dismissed from the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1007/6647.html |title=Roosevelt was right: Waterboarding wrong |first=Daniel A. |last=Rezneck |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=18 April 2009 |publisher=[[The Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt soon declared victory in the Philippines, and the public lost interest in &quot;what had, only months earlier, been alarming revelations&quot;.&lt;ref name=kramer20080225/&gt;

===By U.S. police before the 1940s===
The use of &quot;[[Third degree (interrogation)|third degree interrogation]]&quot; techniques to compel confession, ranging from &quot;psychological duress such as prolonged confinement to extreme violence and torture&quot;, was widespread in early American policing. Lassiter classified the water cure as &quot;orchestrated physical abuse&quot;,&lt;ref name=lassiter2004p47-48&gt;{{cite book |first=G. Daniel |last=Lassiter |chapter=Orchestrated Physical Abuse |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPHHGwxSpLgC&amp;pg=PA47 |title=Interrogations, confessions, and entrapment |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |location=[[New York City]] |year=2004 |pages=47–48 |isbn=0-306-48470-6 |oclc=54685952 |accessdate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described the police technique as a &quot;modern day variation of the method of water torture that was popular during the Middle Ages&quot;.

But I couldn't hold on for more than a few moments. I had the impression of drowning, and a terrible agony, that of death itself, took possession of me. In spite of myself, all the muscles of my body struggled uselessly to save me from suffocation. In spite of myself, the fingers of both my hands shook uncontrollably. &quot;That's it! He's going to talk&quot;, said a voice.

The water stopped running and they took away the rag. I was able to breathe.

However, according to a declassified Justice Department memo attempting to justify torture which references a still-classified report of the CIA Inspector General on the CIA's use of waterboarding, among other &quot;enhanced&quot; interrogation techniques, the CIA applied waterboarding to detainees &quot;in a different manner&quot; than the technique used in SERE training:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The difference was in the manner in which the detainees' breathing was obstructed. At the SERE school and in the DoJ opinion, the subject's airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passages; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contrast, the Agency interrogator ... applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee's mouth and nose. One of the psychiatrist / interrogators acknowledged that the Agency's use of the technique is different from that used in SERE training because it is 'for real' and is more poignant and convincing.&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;Worthington, Andy (1 July 2009) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andy-worthington/release-of-the-holy-grail_b_224447.html &quot;Release of the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of Torture Reports Delayed Again&quot;.] ''Huffington Post''. Retrieved 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to the DOJ memo, the IG Report observed that the CIA's Office of Medical Services (OMS) stated that &quot;the experience of the SERE psychologist / interrogators on the waterboard was probably misrepresented at the time, as the SERE waterboard experience is so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant&quot; and that &quot;[c]onsequently, according to OMS, there was no a priori reason to believe that applying the waterboard with the frequency and intensity with which it was used by the psychologist/interrogators was either efficacious or medically safe.&quot;

In 1983, [[San Jacinto County]], Texas sheriff, James Parker, and three of his deputies were convicted for conspiring to force confessions. The complaint said they &quot;subject prisoners to a suffocating water torture ordeal to coerce confessions. This generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water into the towel until the prisoner began to move, jerk (twitch), or otherwise indicate suffocation and/or drowning&quot;.&lt;ref name=wallach20071104/&gt; James Parker was sentenced to ten years in prison, and the deputies to four years.&lt;ref name=wallach20071104/&gt;&lt;ref name=nprweiner20071103/&gt;

===Use by intelligence officers===
The 21 June 2004 issue of ''[[Newsweek]]'' stated that the [[Bybee Memo]], an early August 2002 legal memorandum drafted by [[John Yoo]] and signed by his boss, [[Jay S. Bybee]], then head of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], described interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists or terrorist affiliates the George W. Bush administration would consider legal, was &quot;prompted by CIA questions about what to do with a top Qaeda captive, [[Abu Zubaydah]], who had turned uncooperative... and was drafted after White House meetings convened by George W. Bush's chief counsel, [[Alberto Gonzales]], along with Defense Department general counsel [[William J.

In November 2005, [[ABC News]] reported that former CIA agents claimed that the CIA engaged in a modern form of waterboarding, along with five other &quot;[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]&quot;, against suspected members of [[al Qaeda]].

On 23 February 2008, the Justice Department revealed that its internal ethics office was investigating the department's legal approval for waterboarding of al Qaeda suspects by the CIA and was likely to make public an unclassified version of its report.&lt;ref name=&quot;titleWaterboarding Focus of Inquiry by Justice Dept. - New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Shane |date=23 February 2008 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/washington/23justice.html |title=Waterboarding Focus of Inquiry by Justice Dept. |accessdate=20 April 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2008, it was reported that the Bush administration had issued a pair of secret memos to the CIA in June 2003 and June 2004 explicitly endorsing waterboarding and other torture techniques against al-Qaeda suspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP10152008&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/14/AR2008101403331.html |title=CIA Tactics Endorsed in Secret Memos |first=Joby |last=Warrick |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memos were granted only after &quot;repeated requests&quot; from the CIA, who at the time were worried that the White House would eventually try to distance themselves from the issue. Field employees in the agency believed they could easily be blamed for using the techniques without proper written permission or authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP10152008&quot; /&gt; Until this point, the Bush administration had never been concretely tied to acknowledging the torture practices.

In December 2008, [[Robert Mueller]], the Director of the FBI since 5 July 2001, had said that despite Bush Administration claims that waterboarding has &quot;disrupted a number of attacks, maybe dozens of attacks&quot;, he does not believe that evidence obtained by the U.S. government through [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] such as waterboarding disrupted one attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/12/11/BL2007121101053.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns Did torture Work?] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' 11 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Rose (16 December 2008) [http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2008/12/torture200812?currentPage=4 &quot;Reckoning&quot;] ''Vanity Fair''.

In an interview in January 2009, [[Dick Cheney]] acknowledged the use of waterboarding to interrogate suspects and said that waterboarding had been &quot;used with great discrimination by people who know what they're doing and has produced a lot of valuable information and intelligence&quot;.&lt;ref name=riechmann20090108&gt;{{cite news |first=Deb |last=Riechmann |date=8 January 2009 |title=Cheney: CIA did nothing illegal in interrogations |url=http://origin.foxnews.com/wires/2009Jan08/0,4670,CheneyInterview,00.html |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |accessdate=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2009, the Obama administration announced that it was delaying the scheduled release of declassified portions of a report by the CIA Inspector General in response to a civil lawsuit. The CIA report reportedly cast doubt on the effectiveness of the torture used by CIA interrogators during the Bush administration. This was based on several George W.

[[Abu Zubaydah]] was waterboarded by the CIA.&lt;ref name=price20080205/&gt;

In 2002, U.S. intelligence located Abu Zubaydah by tracing his phone calls. He was captured 28 March 2002, in a [[al Qaida safe house, Faisalabad|safehouse]] located in a two-story apartment in [[Faisalabad]], Pakistan.

One of Abu Zubaydah's FBI interrogators, [[Ali Soufan]], wrote a book about his experiences. He later testified to Congress that Zubaydah was producing useful information in response to conventional interrogation methods, including the names of Sheikh Mohammed and Jose Padilla. He stopped providing accurate information in response to harsh techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;time.com&quot;&gt;Ghosh, Bobby (24 April 2009).

In December 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that there were some discrepancies regarding reports about the number of times Zubaydah was waterboarded.

Former CIA operative [[John Kiriakou]] in 2007 told CNN's &quot;American Morning&quot; that the waterboarding of [[Al Qaeda]]'s [[Abu Zubaydah]] indirectly led to the arrest of [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-12-11/politics/agent.tapes_1_waterboarding-cia-director-michael-hayden-cia-agent?_s=PM:POLITICS | publisher=CNN | title=CIA chief: Agency 'could have done better' on interrogation tapes | date=12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The former agent, who said he participated in the Abu Zubayda interrogation but not his waterboarding, said the CIA decided to waterboard the al Qaeda operative only after he was &quot;wholly uncooperative&quot; for weeks and refused to answer questions.

:All that changed – and Zubayda reportedly had a divine revelation – after 30 to 35 seconds of waterboarding, Kiriakou said he learned from the CIA agents who performed the technique.

:The terror suspect, who is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, reportedly gave up information that indirectly led to the {{sic|the}} 2003 raid in Pakistan yielding the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, an alleged planner of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Kiriakou said.

=== Obama administration ===
{{See also|Department of Defense Directive 2310}}

[[POTUS|President]] [[Barack Obama]] banned the use of waterboarding and several other interrogation methods in January 2009. He reported that U.S. personnel must stick to the Army Field Manual guidelines.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera20090424&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=23 April 2009 |title=Bush officials blamed over torture |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2009/04/2009422134123634795.html |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early April 2009, the [[Obama administration]] released several classified [[United States Justice Department|Justice Department]] memos from the George W.

Obama opposes the idea of legally prosecuting CIA personnel who committed waterboarding based upon legal advice provided by superiors. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has criticized his stance.&lt;ref name=&quot;warrick20090421&quot;/&gt; In early April 2009, news reports stated that Obama would support an independent investigation over the issue as long as it would be bipartisan.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera20090424&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warrick20090421&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;espo20090423&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Espo |date=23 April 2009 |title=White House opposes special commission |url=http://www.modbee.com/2028/story/677448.html |work=[[The Modesto Bee]] |accessdate=24 April 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April 2009, White House Press Secretary [[Robert Gibbs]] stated that the administration had changed its position and now opposes such an idea.

National Intelligence Director [[Dennis C. Blair|Dennis Blair]] has stated that &quot;high value information&quot; came from waterboarding certain prisoners during the [[George W. Bush administration]]. He also commented that he could not know for sure whether or not other interrogation methods would have caused them to talk, had they been tried.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera20090424&quot;/&gt; In an administration memo that was publicly released, he wrote, &quot;I do not fault those who made the decisions at that time, and I will absolutely defend those who carried out the interrogations within the orders they were given.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;baker20090421&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Baker |authorlink=Peter Baker (author) |date=21 April 2009 |title=Banned Techniques Yielded 'High Value Information,' Memo Says |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/us/politics/22blair.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April poll by [[Rasmussen Reports]] found that 77 percent of voters had followed the story in the media and that 58 percent believe that releasing the memos compromised American national security. On the issue of a further investigation, 58 percent disagreed while 28% agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=58% Say Release of CIA Memos Endangers National Security |publisher=[[Rasmussen Reports]] |date=23 April 2009 |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics2/58_say_release_of_cia_memos_endangers_national_security |accessdate=30 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426200132/http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics2/58_say_release_of_cia_memos_endangers_national_security |archivedate=26 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Obama authorized a successful commando [[Death of Osama bin Laden|raid to kill Osama Bin Laden]]. The extent to which waterboarding assisted in ascertaining the whereabouts of Bin Laden is a matter of dispute. Former Attorney General [[Michael Mukasey]] criticized the Obama administration for denying future missions the intelligence capability that made the raid possible: &quot;Acknowledging and meeting the need for an effective and lawful interrogation program, which we once had, and freeing CIA operatives and others to administer it under congressional oversight, would be a fitting way to mark the demise of Osama bin Laden.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703859304576305023876506348.html?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Michael B. | last=Mukasey | title=The Waterboarding Trail to bin Laden | date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIA Director [[Leon Panetta]], who supervised the operation that found and killed bin Laden, stated in an interview with NBC reporter [[Brian Williams]]: &quot;…they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of these detainees.

Republican Senator [[John McCain]], in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' opinion piece,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lind&quot;/&gt; disputed Mukasey's account, saying:
{{quote|I asked CIA Director Leon Panetta for the facts, and he told me the following: The trail to bin Laden did not begin with a disclosure from Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who was waterboarded 183 times. The first mention of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti — the nickname of the al-Qaeda courier who ultimately led us to bin Laden — as well as a description of him as an important member of al-Qaeda, came from a detainee held in another country, who we believe was not tortured. None of the three detainees who were waterboarded provided Abu Ahmed's real name, his whereabouts or an accurate description of his role in al-Qaeda.

In fact, the use of 'enhanced interrogation techniques' on Khalid Sheik Mohammed produced false and misleading information. He specifically told his interrogators that Abu Ahmed had moved to Peshawar, got married and ceased his role as an al-Qaeda facilitator — none of which was true. According to the staff of the Senate intelligence committee, the best intelligence gained from a CIA detainee — information describing Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's real role in al-Qaeda and his true relationship to bin Laden — was obtained through standard, noncoercive means.}}

U.S. Attorney General [[Eric H.

==Effectiveness==

Waterboarding and other forms of water torture have historically been used for 1) punishing, 2) forcing confessions for use in trials 3) eliciting false confessions for political purposes, and 4) obtaining factual intelligence for military purposes.

===For eliciting confessions===
Its use principally for obtaining confessions rather than as punishment dates back to the 15th century and the [[Spanish Inquisition#Trial|Spanish Inquisition]]. It was also in use for the same purpose, albeit illegally, by [[Waterboarding#Use by law enforcement|U.S. police officers as recently as 1981]].  During the Korean War, the North Koreans used several [[Enhanced Interrogation Techniques|enhanced interrogation techniques (EIT)]] to achieve prisoner compliance and false confessions.&lt;ref name=Biderman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Biderman |first=Albert D. |date= |title=Communist Attempts To Elicit False Confessions From Air Force Prisoners of War |pmc=1806204 |journal=Bulletin of N.Y. Medicine|publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages=619 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such techniques caused a U.S.airmen to falsely &quot;confess&quot; that there was a plan to use biological weapons against North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pincus|first=Walter|title=Waterboarding Historically Controversial|newspaper=The Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100402005.html|date=5 Oct 2006|accessdate=2 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 9/11, CIA interrogators, sought to waterboard suspected terrorists to obtain actionable intelligence, but prisoners falsely confessed to whatever interrogators accused them of in order to stop the EIT.  [[Khalid Shaykh Muhammad]] fabricated stories to give his tormentors &quot;everything they wanted to hear.&quot; Later, he recanted, citing he was being tortured when he made up the stories.  The same was true for the &quot;confessions&quot; elicited by EIT on [[Riduan Isamuddin]], aka Hambali.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report page=85, 91, 95, 108-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===For obtaining actionable intelligence===
Waterboarding's effectiveness as a technique for reliably obtaining truthful, useful intelligence has not been established.  In May 2003, a senior CIA interrogator told the CIA’s Office of Inspector General that the EIT then being used by the CIA was modeled after  U.S. resistance training to prepare servicemen for “physical torture” by North Vietnamese.  This torture, including waterboarding, was intended to extract “confessions for propaganda purposes” from U.S. airman “who possessed little actionable intelligence.”  If the CIA wanted to obtain useful information rather than false confessions, he said, the CIA needed “a different working model for interrogating terrorists.”&lt;ref&gt;Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, with the active support of former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], the CIA embraced the EIT approach proposed by two psychologists, [[James Elmer Mitchell]] and [[Bruce Jessen]], neither of whom had interrogation experience.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report Findings and Conclusions p. 21, 32&lt;/ref&gt;   While Cheney continues to maintain that waterboarding has &quot;produced phenomenal results&quot; including tracking down [[Osama bin Laden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGreal|first=Chris|title=Dick Cheney defends use of torture on al-Qaida leaders |newspaper=The Guardian|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/09/dick-cheney-defends-torture-al-qaida|date=9 Sep 2011|accessdate=2 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that &quot;the CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.&quot;  There was no proof, according to the 6,700 page report, that information obtained through waterboarding prevented any attacks or saved any lives, or that information obtained from the detainees was not or could not have been obtained through conventional interrogation methods.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report Findings and Conclusions p. 2-3, 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

===International law===

All nations that are signatory to the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] have agreed they are subject to the explicit prohibition on torture under any condition. This was affirmed by [[Saadi v. Italy]] in which the [[European Court of Human Rights]], on 28 February 2008, upheld the absolute nature of the torture ban by ruling that international law permits no exceptions to it.&lt;ref name=murphy20080228&gt;{{cite news |first=Brett |last=Murphy |date=28 February 2008 |title=Europe rights court upholds absolute torture ban in Tunisia deportation case |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/02/europe-rights-court-upholds-absolute.php |work=[[JURIST]] |accessdate=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 2.2 of the Convention Against Torture states that &quot;[n]o exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[failed state|political instability]] or any other [[state of emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture.&quot;&lt;ref name=untortureconventiona2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm#art2 |title=Article 2 |work=[[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] |accessdate=21 April 2009 |author=[[United Nations General Assembly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, signatories of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are bound to Article 5, which states, &quot;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&quot;&lt;ref name=udhra5&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html#a5 |title=Article 5 |work=[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] |author=[[United Nations General Assembly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many signatories of the UN Convention Against Torture have made specific declarations and reservations regarding the interpretation of the term &quot;torture&quot; and restricted the [[jurisdiction]] of its enforcement.&lt;ref name=statusuncat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Status |work=[[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] |accessdate=27 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108052518/https://treaties.un.org:80/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=8 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Louise Arbour]], stated on the subject &quot;I would have no problems with describing this practice as falling under the prohibition of torture&quot;, and that violators of the UN Convention Against Torture should be prosecuted under the principle of [[universal jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Louise Arbour&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=96287 |title=Waterboarding qualifies as torture: UN |accessdate=21 April 2009 |date=8 February 2008 |publisher=[[ninemsn]] |agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bent Sørensen, Senior Medical Consultant to the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]] and former member of the United Nations [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] has said:
{{Quote|It's a clear-cut case: Waterboarding can without any reservation be labeled as torture. It fulfils all of the four central criteria that according to the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT) defines an act of torture. First, when water is forced into your lungs in this fashion, in addition to the pain you are likely to experience an immediate and extreme fear of death. You may even suffer a heart attack from the stress or damage to the lungs and brain from inhalation of water and oxygen deprivation. In other words there is no doubt that waterboarding causes severe physical and/or mental suffering– one central element in the UNCAT's definition of torture. In addition the CIA's waterboarding clearly fulfills the three additional definition criteria stated in the Convention for a deed to be labeled torture, since it is 1) done intentionally, 2) for a specific purpose and 3) by a representative of a state– in this case the US.&lt;ref name=icrt20080212&gt;{{cite press release |title=Former member of UN Committee Against Torture: 'Yes, waterboarding is torture' |publisher=[[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]] |date=12 February 2008 |url=http://www.irct.org/news-and-media/irct-news/show-news.aspx?M=NewsV2&amp;PID=13767&amp;NewsID=1236 |accessdate=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lt. Gen. [[Michael D.

In a review of ''The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals'', by [[Jane Mayer]], ''The New York Times'' reported on 11 July 2008, that &quot;[[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] investigators concluded last year in a secret report that the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of [[war crimes]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=shane20080711&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Shane |date=11 July 2008 |title=Book Cites Secret Red Cross Report of C.I.A.

===United States law===

The [[United States Supreme Court]] in [[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]], said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights &quot;does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]], {{ussc|542|692|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United States has a historical record of regarding waterboarding as a war crime, and has prosecuted individuals for such practice in the past.

In 1947, during the [[Yokohama War Crimes Trials]], the United States prosecuted a Japanese civilian who had served in World War II as an interpreter for the Japanese military, Yukio Asano, for &quot;Violation of the [[laws of war|Laws and Customs of War]]&quot;, asserting that he &quot;did unlawfully take and convert to his own use [[Red Cross parcel|Red Cross packages and supplies]] intended for&quot; prisoners, but, far worse, that he also &quot;did willfully and unlawfully mistreat and torture&quot; prisoners of war. The charges against Asano included &quot;beating using hands, fists, club; kicking; water torture; burning using cigarettes; strapping on a stretcher head downward.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~warcrime/Japan/Yokohama/Reviews/Yokohama_Review_Asano.htm |title=Yukio Asano |work=Case Synopses from Judge Advocate's Reviews: Yokohama Class B and C War Crimes Trials |publisher=UC Berkeley War Crimes Studies Center |year=2007 |accessdate=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specifications in the charges with regard to &quot;water torture&quot; consisted of &quot;pouring water up [the] nostrils&quot; of one prisoner, &quot;forcing water into [the] mouths and noses&quot; of two other prisoners, and &quot;forcing water into [the] nose&quot; of a fourth prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2008electionprocon.org/pdf/asano_case.pdf |title=Retrieved 14 May 2009. |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asano received a sentence of 15&amp;nbsp;years of [[hard labor]].&lt;ref name=walter20061005/&gt;

Both houses of the United States Congress approved a bill by February 2008 that would ban waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods, the [[Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008]].

==Images of waterboarding in use==
[[File:Waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah.jpg|thumb|''Waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah'' by  {{Interlanguage link multi|Dmitry Borshch|ru|3=Борщ, Дмитрий Геннадиевич}}]]

While waterboarding has been depicted in several films and demonstrated at protest gatherings, images of its actual use are scarce. The CIA allegedly destroyed all videos it made of the procedure. The 1968 Washington Post photo of a captured North Vietnamese soldier  being interrogated is arguably different because instead of being strapped to a board, the prisoner is held down by two soldiers as a third pours water from a canteen over a cloth covering face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1356870|title=History of an Interrogation Technique: Water Boarding|first=A.

One eye-witness depiction of waterboarding is a painting by [[Vann Nath]], a [[Cambodia]]n artist who was held captive and tortured by the [[Khmer Rouge]]. After his release in 1979 from [[Tuol Sleng Prison]], he began to paint pictures of the abusive practices used there, including waterboarding, to let people know about them, saying of the prisoners he heard screaming for help: &quot;I would like their souls to get something from what I paint.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/asian/Vann-Nath.html |title=Vann Nath - Paint Propaganda or Die |publisher=The Art History Archive |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of his waterboarding paintings depicts a sparse room with a man affixed to a board by iron bars. A cloth covers his head. Another man pours water from a watering can over his face. A similar board and watering can are on display at the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]]. ''Waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah'', a drawing by {{Interlanguage link multi|Dmitry Borshch|ru|3=Борщ, Дмитрий Геннадиевич}}, has been exhibited at the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], [[DePaul University]], [[Brecht Forum]], [[The Graduate Center, CUNY]], and [[Palace of Culture and Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pictify.com/434930/waterboarding-of-abu-zubaydah|title=Waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artsy.net/post/raccny-literary-scholar-john-maynard-and-artist-dmitry|title=Literary scholar John Maynard and artist Dmitry Borshch in conversation on art|date=27 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdiscover.com/en/artists/dmitry-borshch-id1822|title=Artist: Dmitry Borshch - Artists on ArtDiscover|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the ''[[Coney Island waterboarding thrill ride]]'' went on display in [[Coney Island]] amusement park: viewers would see two models, one a captive wearing an [[Guantanamo captives' uniform|orange uniform]] who was spread-eagled on a tilted table, the other one a masked interrogator.  When viewers inserted a dollar the interrogator figure would pour water onto a rag over the captive figures' nose and throat, upon which the captive figure would start convulsing.&lt;ref name=NYMag2008-06-27&gt;{{cite news
