      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5516">'''Benjamin Franklin Ficklin''' (1827–1871) was a graduate of the [[Virginia Military Institute]], Class of 1849. He is famous for his help in starting the [[Pony Express]] and for establishing other [[stage coach]] and mail routes in the United States during the nineteenth century. Ficklin was also one of the people responsible for the creation of the [[Pacific Telegraph Company]] in 1861. 

Born in [[Albemarle County, Virginia]] in 1827, Ficklin had a reputation for misbehaving. So in 1845, his father sent young Ficklin to attend the [[Virginia Military Institute]]. As a cadet, Ficklin was known for his pranks, and he often got in trouble for them. One night, he filled a howitzer with gunpowder, turned it toward the cadet barracks, and discharged it (Virginia Military Institute Archives, 2005). This action resulted in his suspension in 1846. 

With his suspension, Ficklin entered the Army. He ultimately served as a corporal in the [[Mexican-American War]], where he was injured but recovered. Ficklin requested to be readmitted into the corps of cadets at the Virginia Military Institute, and his request was approved. Upon graduation, Ficklin attempted to work as a teacher. Dissatisfied, he sought employment with an express company in [[Alabama]]. Later, he worked as a surveyor for varied freight lines. In 1859, Ficklin returned to the express and stage business which now boomed with the western expansion precipitated in the wave of [[Gold Rush]] fever. In 1860, some credit him with the idea of the [[Pony Express]]. Yet, [[William Hepburn Russell]], [[Alexander Majors]], and [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] are more often credited as the founders, owners, and operators of the Pony Express. Ficklin did serve as general manager for the venture, until a disagreement with Russell. Russell allegedly became jealous of Ficklin’s popularity and suspicious of Ficklin’s loyalties. Learning of this, Ficklin immediately resigned.

In 1860, the [[Pacific Telegraph Act of 1860]] called for the facilitation of communication between the east and west coasts of the United States of America.  [[Hiram Sibley]] of the [[Western Union]] Telegraph Company won the contract.  In 1861, Ficklin joined Hiram Sibley in helping to form the [[Pacific Telegraph Company]] of [[Nebraska]].  At the same time, [[Jeptha Wade]] was asked by Hiram Sibley to consolidate smaller telegraph companies in [[California]].  While the Pacific Telegraph Company built west from [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the [[Overland Telegraph Company]] of California was thus formed and built east from [[Carson City, Nevada]].  With their connection in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] on October 24, 1861, the final link between the east and west coasts of the United States of America was made.  The [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]] would ironically lead to the immediate demise of the Pony Express.  The Pacific Telegraph Company and Overland Telegraph Company of California were eventually absorbed into the Western Union Telegraph Company.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Ficklin joined the [[Confederate States of America]]’s war effort in Virginia. He eventually served as a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] purchasing agent in Europe and as an intelligence officer. During the war, he achieved some status. In 1864, he even bought [[Thomas Jefferson]]’s [[Monticello]], but it would be stripped from him under [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In 1865, Ficklin was sent on a secret peace mission to [[Washington, D.C.]]. While there, [[Abraham Lincoln]] was assassinated, and Ficklin was arrested. He was cleared of suspicion and released upon his swearing a loyalty oath to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].

After the Civil War, Major Ficklin opened an express [[stagecoach]] business in [[Texas]]. The route served from [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], to California. He founded a town in Texas to serve his enterprise. After his death, the town was named after him. Today, [[Ben Ficklin, Texas]], is a [[ghost town]].

In the course of his final business venture, which included a U. S. Post Office [[subcontractor|subcontract]], Ficklin frequently visited Washington, DC where, in March 1871, he was dining at a [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] restaurant when a fishbone lodged in his throat. He died a few days later, after a physician cut an artery while trying to remove the bone. 

He is buried in Maplewood Cemetery in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].

One of his descendants, Jared Ficklin, would later appear on the [[PBS]] reality show [[Texas Ranch House]] portraying a cowboy.  Correction: Jared Ficklin is related to Benjamin Franklin Ficklin, but is not a decendant given that Benjamin Franklin Ficklin died without children, therefore, he can have no direct decendants.
