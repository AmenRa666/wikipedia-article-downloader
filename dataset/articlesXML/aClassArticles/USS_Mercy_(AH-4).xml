'''USS ''Mercy'' (ID-1305/AH-4)''' was a [[hospital ship]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]]. She was the first U.S. Navy ship of that name. The ship was previously known as '''SS ''Saratoga''''', a steamer for the [[Ward Line]] on the [[New York City|New York]] to [[Havana]] route, and considered the fastest steamship in coastal trade.&lt;ref name=NYT-collision&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A03E1DD103BE03ABC4950DFB166838C609EDE  | title = Ship collision due to mistaken signal | work = The New York Times | date = 31 July 1917 | accessdate = 23 January 2008 | page = 1 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being purchased by the Navy, the ship was briefly employed as [[United States Army]] transport ship '''USAT ''Saratoga''''', a career that ended after a collision off [[Staten Island]], New York.&lt;ref name=NYT-collision /&gt;

In her Navy career, ''Mercy'' made four transatlantic round trips to [[France]], bringing home almost 2,000 wounded men. After the end of World War I, the ship was based in Philadelphia, and briefly laid up there in 1924. The ship was decommissioned in 1934 and lent to the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]], struck in 1938, and scrapped in 1939.

== SS ''Saratoga'' ==
''Saratoga'' was launched in March 1907 by [[William Cramp and Sons]], [[Philadelphia]], for the [[Ward Line]] of [[New York City|New York]]. The ship was placed in service later that year on the New York to Havana route where she stayed for the next ten years. She was considered by some as the fastest steamship in the coastal trade.&lt;ref name=NYT-collision /&gt;

Shortly after entering service, the new liner was rammed by a three-masted schooner in stormy seas. ''Saratoga'' was steaming from Havana at {{convert|16|kn|km/h}} when the schooner hit the port quarter and raked the side, at 01:00 on 29 October 1907. Her captain could not identify the other ship, but waited, in vain, for three hours to offer assistance. Damage to ''Saratoga'' was minor, though the schooner lost some rigging from the front of the ship.&lt;ref name=NYT-schooner /&gt;

In March 1911, the captain of ''Saratoga'', Cleveland Downs, faced legal difficulties regarding the way live turtles were stored aboard while being imported to market. Downs was arrested in New York on charges of cruelty to animals because the turtles had been stored upside down, with flippers lashed to one another; Miller contended that this was standard practice and asked that the charges be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D0DEEDE1431E233A25757C2A9659C946096D6CF | format = pdf | title = For cruelty to turtles | work = The New York Times | date = 24 March 1911 | accessdate = 24 January 2008 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later ''Saratoga'' captain also faced legal troubles, when, in June 1912, Frank L. Miller was arrested by Sheriff [[Julius Harburger]] in New York and forced to post a $500 appearance bond in a civil suit involving a former crewman. Miller’s arrest delayed the departure of the ship by two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9406E4D91E3CE633A25755C1A9609C946396D6CF | format = pdf | title = Arrest captain, delay ship | work = The New York Times | date = 16 June 1912 | accessdate = 24 January 2008 | page = 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 1912, ''Saratoga'' stood by &quot;within a few hundred yards&quot; of the hulk of {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} when that re-floated warship was sunk in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], allowing passengers and crew to witness the historic ship’s final disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C02EFDB133AE633A25753C2A9659C946396D6CF | format = pdf | title = Watched the Maine sink | work = The New York Times | date = 20 March 1912 | accessdate = 24 January 2008 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 1914 from about 19:30 to 21:00, ''Saratoga'' was steaming north {{convert|40|nmi|km}} off the [[Virginia Capes]] (and {{convert|240|nmi|km}} south of the [[Scotland Lightship]]) when passengers and crew saw flashes and heard reports from guns of &quot;heavy calibre&quot; that they thought were from a naval gun battle. Speculation at the time centered on a confrontation between [[German Empire|German]] [[cruiser]] [[SMS Karlsruhe (1912)|''Karlsruhe'']]—which had been sinking [[British Empire|British]] vessels in the Atlantic and Caribbean areas—and one of the [[Royal Navy]] cruisers {{HMS|Essex|1901|2}} or {{HMS|Suffolk|1903|2}}. A follow-up news story reported that ''Saratoga'' had chanced upon U.S. Navy gunnery practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9803E5DF153AE633A25754C2A9669D946596D6CF | format = pdf | title = Sea battle off Virginia Capes | work = The New York Times | date = 27 October 1914 | accessdate = 24 January 2008 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F04E0D7143EE033A2575BC2A9669D946596D6CF | format = pdf | title = Tells of firing at sea | work = The New York Times | date = 28 October 1914 | accessdate = 24 January 2008 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 1917 ''Saratoga'' and {{SS|Havana||2}}, her Ward Line sister-ship, were requisitioned by the U.S. government. On 2 June, after returning from her last commercial round trip to Cuba, ''Saratoga'' was turned over to the [[United States Army]] for service as a transport ship.&lt;ref name=CW-316 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WP-req&gt;{{cite news | title = U.S. to requisition ships | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 24 May 1917 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career as a passenger liner, ''Saratoga'' carried some notable passengers between New York and Caribbean ports. [[Mario García Menocal]] sailed from Havana to New York for &quot;personal business&quot; after having lost the [[President of Cuba|Cuban presidential election]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C05E3DA1739E333A25755C2A9679D946997D6CF | format = pdf | title = Gen. Mario Menocal here | work = The New York Times | date = 26 November 1908 | accessdate = 24 January  2008 | page = 5 }} Menocal would later serve as [[President of Cuba]] from 1913 to 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, [[Cipriano Castro]], the former [[President of Venezuela]] (1899–1909), sailed to Havana for his health in 1913. A report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' speculated that Castro was going to meet with associates and &quot;professional revolutionaries&quot; in Havana in an attempt to regain power in Venezuela (which never occurred).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9A0CE2DA133BE633A25750C2A9649C946296D6CF | format = pdf | title = Castro sails away to Havana friends | work = The New York Times | date = 23 February 1913 | accessdate = 24 January 2008 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1914, [[John Murphy Farley|Cardinal Farley]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archbishop of New York]] from 1902 to 1918, sailed on ''Saratoga'' for a trip to [[The Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9B00E7D61F3BE633A2575BC0A9649C946596D6CF | format = pdf | title = Cardinal Farley off to Bahamas | work = The New York Times | date = 8 February 1914 | accessdate = 24 January 2008 | page = C5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== USAT ''Saratoga'' ==
After her requisition from the Ward Line, the steamer was turned over to the Army on 2 June 1917, becoming Army transport USAT ''Saratoga''.&lt;ref name=CW-316 /&gt;&lt;!--date of handover, outfitting--&gt;  She was hurriedly outfitted for troop transport duties and became part of the first group of the first American troop convoy to France during World War I.&lt;ref name=Gleaves-38&gt;Gleaves, pp. 38&lt;!-- list of groups--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The convoy set out from [[Ambrose Light]] for [[Brest, France]], at daybreak on 14 June 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Gleaves, pp. 41.&lt;!--departure time--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Saratoga'' was accompanied by fellow Army transport ships ''Havana'', {{USAT|Tenadores||2}}, and {{USAT|Pastores||2}}, the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Seattle|ACR-11|2}}, [[transport]]/[[auxiliary cruiser]] {{USS|DeKalb|ID-3010|2}}, destroyers {{USS|Wilkes|DD-67|2}}, {{USS|Terry|DD-25|2}}, {{USS|Roe|DD-24|2}}, and converted yacht {{USS|Corsair|SP-159|2}}.&lt;ref name=Gleaves-38 /&gt;&lt;!-- list of groups--&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;''Corsair'' was unable to maintain the {{convert|15|kn|km/h|adj=on}} pace and fell back, being replaced by destroyer {{USS|Fanning|DD-37|2}} from the second group. See: Gleaves, pp. 41–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:USS-Mercy-(ID-1536)-in-1918.jpg|thumb|''Mercy'' sails into New York with wounded soldiers after a stormy transatlantic voyage, 12 December 1918]]

At 22:15 on 22 June, some {{convert|850|nmi|km}} from the convoy's intended destination of Brest, ''Saratoga''’s group of the convoy was attacked by submarines. Two torpedoes passed near ''Havana'' and two torpedoes straddled ''DeKalb''. No submarine was definitively sighted and the convoy, scattered by the alarm, reformed the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;Gleaves, pp. 42–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The group, alerted by reports of submarine activity near Brest diverted to [[Saint-Nazaire]] and arrived on 25 June.&lt;ref&gt;Gleaves, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

After sailing back to the United States, ''Saratoga'' loaded 1,200 passengers at [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], on 30 July, a hot summer day. In preparation for sailing for France the next day, the transport sailed to an anchorage at [[Tompkinsville, Staten Island]]. Among the passengers on board were nurses of  the Army's Base Hospital No. 8. To escape the sweltering heat aboard the ship, many of the nurses on board returned to their cabins after lunch and removed their heavy wool uniforms.&lt;ref name=Dock_et_al&gt;Dock et al., pp. 496–97.&lt;/ref&gt; While at anchor at about 13:30, ''Saratoga'' was rammed in the port quarter by {{SS|Panama||2}} of the [[Panama Steamship Company]] after her engine room misunderstood a command from the bridge. The force of the impact buckled plating from ''Saratoga''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s rail down to the waterline,&lt;ref name=CDT-steamer_rams&gt;{{cite news | title = Steamer rams U. S. transport; troops saved | work = [[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]] | date = 31 July 1917 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} hole. ''Saratoga'' began to list almost immediately, and the abandon ship signal was given soon after. The passengers, including nurses in various states of undress, reported to their assigned lifeboats and evacuated the ship in an orderly fashion.&lt;ref name=Dock_et_al /&gt; The close proximity to shore, and the large number of smaller craft in the vicinity, allowed all on board to be rescued without loss of life or injury. ''Panama'' had only superficial damage; ''Saratoga'' raised anchor and was towed near the [[Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Company]] where she was allowed to settle in the mud.&lt;ref name=NYT-collision /&gt; The erstwhile ''Saratoga'' passengers were collected from the various rescue craft and were loaded onto {{USAT|Finland||2}},&lt;ref name=Dock_et_al /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; where they sailed for France on 6 August.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell and Wilson, p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;There is conflicting information in sources as to whether or not ''Saratoga'' sailed on her planned trip to France the next day. Accounts in Benson (p. 221) and Dock et al. (p. 497) make clear that the passengers from ''Saratoga'' sailed on ''Finland''. Further, in Dock et al. (p. 497) and news accounts from both ''The New York Times'' (31 July 1917, p. 1) and ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (31 July 1917, p. 2), it is clear that the ship sank or was allowed to sink; the latter further reports that it would &quot;take weeks to repair&quot; the ship. Nevertheless, Crowell and Wilson report that ''Saratoga'' sailed the following day (p. 416) as part of the fifth American convoy , consisting of ''Saratoga'', {{USAT|Pastores||2}}, {{USAT|Tenadores||2}}, {{USAT|Henry R. Mallory||2}}, cruiser {{USS|North Carolina|ACR-12|2}}, and [[Oiler (ship)|oiler]] {{USS|Arethusa|AO-7|2}} (p. 603).&lt;/ref&gt;

== USS ''Mercy'' ==
On 27 September 1917, the U.S. Navy purchased ''Saratoga'' from the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. On 30 October 1917, she began conversion to a hospital ship at the [[New York Navy Yard]], [[Brooklyn, New York]], and was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] USS ''Mercy'' on 24 January 1918. ''Mercy'' and {{USS|Comfort|AH-3|2}} (former Ward Line mate, ''Havana'') were the first Navy hospital ships to have female nurses aboard. Both ships were outfitted with state-of-the-art operating rooms and [[X-ray]] labs and could accommodate 500 patients each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A0DE7DA163AE532A25750C1A9679C946996D6CF | format = pdf | title = Army and Navy notes | work = The New York Times | date = 13 January 1918 | accessdate = 24 January 2008 | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, ''Mercy'' operated in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area with [[Yorktown, Virginia]], as her home port, attending the war wounded and transporting them from ships to shore hospitals. In October 1918 she sailed for New York to join the [[Cruiser and Transport Service]]. On 3 November the hospital ship departed New York on the first of four round trips to [[France]], returning 1,977 casualties by 25 March 1919.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Mercy | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m9/mercy-i.htm | short = on }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Uss mercy and relief.jpg|thumb|left|''Mercy'' and {{USS|Relief|AH-1|2}} are seen at anchor in [[Guantánamo Bay]], [[Cuba]], in April 1927. Note the absence of hospital markings on both ships.]]

For most of the next 15 years following World War I, ''Mercy'' served off the east coast based at Philadelphia. In July 1920, she was redesignated &quot;AH-4&quot;.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

From 1 December 1924, until 1 September 1925, she was in reserve at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]. On 25 November She went into reduced commission, returning to full commission 1 September 1926.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; In early 1927, ''Mercy'' was painted white with no hospital markings, but by the time of a 1931 visit to [[Vancouver]], the markings had been restored.&lt;ref name=navsrc&gt;{{cite web | first = Gary P. | last = Priolo | url = http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/12/1204.htm | title =  ID-1305 / AH-4 Mercy | work = NavSource Online | publisher = NavSource Naval History | date = 5 October 2007 | accessdate = 24 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mercy'' remained in commission until loaned to the Philadelphia branch of the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] on 23 March 1934.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; Anchored at Girard Point, the ship served as a home for up to 300 [[homelessness|homeless]] men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =  $6,000 missing in relief fund | work = The New York Times | date = 1935-05-04 | page = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April 1938, she was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] and on 16 March 1939 sold for scrapping to Boston Iron &amp; Metals Company of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;
