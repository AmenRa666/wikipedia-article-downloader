'''USS ''Thomas F. Nickel'' (DE-587)''' was a {{sclass|Rudderow|destroyer escort}} of the [[United States Navy]] named in honor of [[Private (rank)|Private]] [[Thomas F. Nickel]], [[United States Marine Corps]], who was killed in the [[Pacific War]] in 1942 and [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded a [[Silver Star]].
 
''Thomas F. Nickel'' was laid down on 15 December 1943 at [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], by the [[Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard]]s; launched on 22 January 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Fred W. Nickel; and commissioned on 9 June 1944, Lt. Comdr. Claude S. Farmer, USNR, in command.

==Service history==

===World War II, 1944&amp;ndash;1945===
After shakedown training in the Caribbean from 29 June to 26 July, the destroyer escort made one round-trip voyage across the Atlantic escorting [[UG convoys|Convoy UGS-50]] to [[Bizerte]], [[Tunisia]], and back before departing [[Boston]] with Escort Division 71 on the last day of September, bound for the South Pacific.

She transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 15 October and, after calls at the [[Galápagos Islands|Galápagos]] and [[Society Islands]], arrived at [[Espiritu Santo]] on 1 November. There, after the destroyer escort had taken on 15 [[aerial torpedo]]es as deck cargo, she headed for [[Manus Island|Manus]]. She delivered her dangerous cargo at [[Seeadler Harbor]] on 7 November. Three days later, the ship was anchored there slightly more than a mile from [[ammunition ship]] {{USS|Mount Hood|AE-11|3}} when she exploded, but was not damaged.

''Thomas F. Nickel'' next proceeded to [[New Guinea]] and arrived at [[Yos Sudarso Bay|Humboldt Bay]] on 21 November. The following week she again put to sea in the screen of a Philippine-bound convoy. She arrived at [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]], [[Leyte]], on 15 December and, two days later, began the return voyage to [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] with another convoy.

On 28 December, the destroyer escort departed [[Aitape]] with Task Group 78.1, the [[San Fabian, Pangasinan|San Fabian]] Attack Force, which was transporting the [[43rd Infantry Division (United States)|43rd Infantry Division]] to make the initial [[Battle of Luzon|assault against Luzon]]. The American ships entered [[Lingayen Gulf]] on 9 January 1945, and the DE protected the landings. She was then assigned to the anti-submarine and anti-aircraft screen until 18 January. On 10 January, {{USS|DuPage|APA-41|3}} was hit and badly damaged by a [[kamikaze|suicide plane]]; a boat from ''Nickel'' rescued five of that attack transport's crewmen who had been blown overboard and gave them medical attention.

On 18 January orders sent DE-587 to New Guinea waters to conduct anti-submarine patrols between the islands of [[Schouten Islands|Biak and Owi]]; but, early in February, she found herself heading back to the Philippines in the screen of Task Group 78.6, the third Lingayen reinforcement group. She remained in the Lingayen area of Luzon from 6 February until 7 March. In the following months, the escort performed anti-submarine patrol and escort duty between San Pedro, [[Subic Bay]], and ports in New Guinea and the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]]. On 6 August, she departed Subic Bay with a convoy to refuel at [[Buckner Bay]] and returned to the Philippines escorting {{USS|Oak Hill|LSD-7|3}}. In the evening of 12 August ''Oak Hill'' reported a periscope on her port quarter and, eight minutes later, a torpedo wake 2,000 yards astern of her. ''Thomas F. Nickel'' made several depth charge attacks and then lost contact. Both ships arrived safely at Leyte on the 15th, the day hostilities ended.

===Post-war activities, 1945&amp;ndash;1946===
The destroyer escort made one more round-trip voyage to Buckner Bay in late August, escorting {{USS|Cabildo|LSD-16|3}} there and returning with {{USS|Hocking|APA-121|3}}. She operated in the Philippines until 29 November when she got underway for the United States.  ''Thomas F. Nickel'' arrived at [[San Diego]] on 18 December 1945, and was decommissioned on 31 May 1946.

===Naval reserve training ship, 1948&amp;ndash;1957===
In June she was assigned to the [[12th Naval District]] as a training ship. On 31 October, she arrived under tow at [[San Francisco]] and was subsequently moved to [[Sacramento]] for use as a naval reserve armory.

The destroyer escort was reactivated on 8 July 1948 and placed in service as a [[United States Navy Reserve|naval reserve]] training ship. She made weekend and two-week cruises to Mexico, Canada, Alaska, Pearl Harbor, and Pacific coast ports. After the ship was recommissioned on 22 September 1950 she continued the same duty. She operated out of San Francisco until December 1951, when she moved to San Diego.

''Nickel'' made a goodwill visit to [[Humboldt Bay]], California for [[Armed Forces Day]] in May 1954 and also a two-week Pacific cruise in February 1955 arriving in Honolulu on 17 February, and returning to [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island, San Francisco]] on 26 February.

===Decommissioning and sale===
On 25 November 1957 ''Thomas F. Nickel'' was assigned to the [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]]. She was decommissioned on 26 February 1958 and berthed at San Diego until she was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 1 December 1972. Her hulk was sold for scrap at [[San Jose, California]], to the Levin Metals Co. on 9 June 1973.
