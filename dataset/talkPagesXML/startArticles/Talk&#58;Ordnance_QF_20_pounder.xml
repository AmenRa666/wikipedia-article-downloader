==Performance==
I've read a couple of times that the performance of the 20-pdr is &quot;about twice that of the 17-pdr&quot;, without much by way of explanation of what's meant by that.  Twice the penetration at 500 yards?  The same penetration at twice the distance?  If anyone could expand on that claim (or debunk it) please do so!  [[User:Cbh|Chris]] 22:12, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
: I found a similar comparison in Osprey's book on the Centurion (p. 10), in which it states &quot;a 20-pounder APDS round had twice the penetration capability as the fabled 88mm AP round of World War II&quot;.  If one assumes the 305mm quote for APDS penetration is accurate, this comparison is roughly correct as the 88mm KwK 36 L/56 on the Tiger I could penetrate 127mm of armor at 100 meters with a 30º obliquity, which would approximate to 150mm of armor penetrated at a 0º obliquity.  This difference in performance is mostly due to the difference in muzzle velocities, as the 20-pounder APDS round moved over 600 meters per second faster than the Tiger's AP round. [[User:W. B.

:::Either way, it's a quote from the section talking about increases in performance through the introduction of APDS rounds.  It doesn't differentiate between the advantage from muzzle velocity and the advantage from the difference in the projectile.  [[User:Lkchild|Lkchild]] ([[User talk:Lkchild|talk]]) 23:03, 3 July 2016 (UTC) 

&quot;In a number of respects, the 20 pounder's design followed that of the German 8.8 cm KwK 43, such as a length of 66.7 calibres and the ability to fire conventional APCBC projectiles.&quot;

:What kind of sentence even is this? I can't establish a logical correlation between the first and second part of the sentece, and surely not with the end of it. The KwK had a barrel length of 71 calibres, not 66.7, so what are we on about? The APCBC thing? That was the standard projectile of the era! Every gun in that era was optimised to fire APCBC, so following the logic in that sentence we could say that, I don't know, the 20 pounder's design follows the design of the D-25 closely or that of the M1A1, because both of those can fire APCBC. Seriously guys?  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/91.82.242.222|91.82.242.222]] ([[User talk:91.82.242.222|talk]]) 21:33, 13 July 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:: I just found that it's a direct quote from  Technology of Tanks by Ogorkiewicz (page 70).  Thats normally a well respected reference, but it sounds like it may be in error.  To be fair, it's from a passage discussing ammunition, so details of the gun may have slipped through review.  [[User:Lkchild|Lkchild]] ([[User talk:Lkchild|talk]]) 22:26, 3 July 2016 (UTC)

== Comparison Chart ==

The article states that the 20 pdr fired both APCBC and APDS, but the comparison chart is comparing the subcaliber APDS round in the 20 pdr with full caliber rounds in all the other guns...wouldn't it make more sense to use figures for the APCBC projectile? [[User:JDS2005|JDS2005]] ([[User talk:JDS2005|talk]]) 05:20, 17 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes it would, but I haven't been able to find any decent sources.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/77.102.120.98|77.102.120.98]] ([[User talk:77.102.120.98|talk]]) 18:43, 6 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:APDS substantially replaced the other types of AP tank gun rounds (with the exception of [[High explosive squash head|HESH]], which is also useful against concrete emplacements) in the British Army as it's performance was so much better than APC, APBC, APCBC, APCR, So it may be difficult to find figures for these rounds, even if they were designed and made for the 20pdr. In the case of the other guns, APDS rounds were not developed for these, as APDS was a late-war invention by the Brits.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.112.68.219|86.112.68.219]] ([[User talk:86.112.68.219|talk]]) 19:08, 16 June 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::The advent of APDS fired from guns such as the 20 pdr and 105mm L7 are what made the [[Heavy tank]] obsolete as a tank type post WW II, as the performance of gun and ammunition is so great that it became impracticable to build a successful tank with armour thick enough to protect it.</text>
