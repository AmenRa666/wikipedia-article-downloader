In 2011, he became the first member of the PRNG to be named Superintendent of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]].

==Early years==

Díaz Colón is the oldest of three siblings born to Emilio Díaz Lebron and Margarita Colón in the town of [[Yabucoa, Puerto Rico]]. His father was the head foreman of the Central Roig sugar cane plantation. The Central Roig was one of the last mills that produced sugar in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutmybeaches.com/4074/central-roig-historic-sugar-cane-plantation-and-mill-yabucoa-puerto-rico-el-yunque-rain-forest/ Central Roig sugar cane plantation]&lt;/ref&gt; Díaz Colón was raised in his hometown where he received his primary and secondary education. Díaz Colón's brother Luis F. &quot;Pickie&quot; Díaz Colón, former Head of the National Parks Company, was once the Mayor of their hometown Yabucoa.&lt;ref name=&quot;NC&quot;/&gt;

In 1968, Díaz Colón joined the [[Army National Guard]] (ARNG) as an enlisted soldier in an engineer company, while at the same time he was enrolled and attended classes at the [[University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez]]. In 1971, Díaz Colón earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in [[Civil Engineering]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OB&quot;&gt;[http://www.ng.mil/ngbgomo/library/bio/diaz-colon_e.html National Guard Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==

Díaz Colón was selected to attend the Warrant Officer program at the [[Warrant Officer Candidate School (U.S. Army)|Warrant Officer Candidate School]], which is administered by the [[Warrant Officer Career College (U.S. Army)|Warrant Officer Career College]] at [[Fort Rucker, Alabama]].

On August 3, 1976, he was promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant and assigned as Engineering Officer for the same Battalion. From January 1977 to August 1979, Díaz Colón served with Company D 130th Engineer Battalion at [[Carolina, Puerto Rico]] in the positions of Engineer Platoon Leader and Company Executive Officer. After his promotion to the rank of Captain he was named Company Commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRNG&quot;&gt;[http://www.ng.mil/ngbgomo/library/bio/diaz-colon_e.html National Guard Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1979, he was reassigned to the 892d Engineer Company at [[Humacao, Puerto Rico]] as Company Commander and in September 1979, he was the Assistant S-3 of the Command and Control at PRNG Headquarters in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].

==Government positions==

In 1978, the Governor of Puerto Rico, [[Carlos Romero Barcelo]] appointed Díaz Colón to the position of Executive Director of the Authority of Solid Wastes in Puerto Rico. He served in this position until 1981.

During the years that he served in the Commissioners Office, the Puerto Rico National Guard named Díaz Colón Battalion Commander of the 130th Engineer Battalion. From 1985 to 1990, Díaz-Colón was given a Federal position when he was placed in charge of the Housing Urban Development (HUD) in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP&quot;/&gt;
