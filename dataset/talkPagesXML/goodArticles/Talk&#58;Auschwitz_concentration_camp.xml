== Death toll ==

Regarding my removal of content added to the lead by [[:User: Logicalgenius3]]. I don't think we  shouldn present any one estimate in the lead as being definitive; please see the section &quot;Death toll&quot; for estimates of various historians. Also, saying in the info box that the facility had 1.125+&amp;nbsp;million inmates is misleading, as the number of prisoners varied widely at any given time. ‚Äî [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;üçÅ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 21:58, 13 November 2016 (UTC)
:&quot;don't&quot; + &quot;shouldn&quot; = &quot;should&quot;, but your whim (&quot;I don't think&quot;) is not consistent with the Wipikedia's [[WP:SOURCES]] and prohibited ([[WP:OWN]]).  You seem not reading the cited sources, but you should, and also must before baseless reverting, which is a blanking vandalism.  Please, do read them.  Those are not estimates, but credible calculations made several times by the Auschwitz commandant [[Rudolf H√∂ss]] himself before he was tortured, had nothing to gain from lying, and also confirmed by [http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/camps/auschwitz/crematoria/furnace-capacity-analysis.html accurately calculated capacity of the crematoria] - thus an estimate, but the actual figure.

:The &quot;Inmates&quot; line refers to the total number and not at any given time (i.e. the capacity; who cares), as the &quot;Killed&quot; line does, and we know that almost all (1.125 M) killed were Jews, and only a handful survived, so the 1.125+ M number is accurate and much better that the word &quot;mainly&quot;, which denotes not accurately. --[[User:Logicalgenius3|Logicalgenius3]] ([[User talk:Logicalgenius3|talk]]) 23:16, 13 November 2016 (UTC)

::There's a difference of opinion among scholars as to the death toll at Auschwitz. Please read the &quot;Death toll&quot; section for more information. H√∂ss's numbers are only one of many estimates and cannot be considered definitive in my opinion. ‚Äî [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;üçÅ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 00:36, 14 November 2016 (UTC)

::I agree with Dianna. [[User:Dr.K.|&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:600;font-family: arial;color: steelblue;font-size: 1em;&quot;&gt;Dr.&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Dr.K.|&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:600;font-family: arial;color: steelblue; font-size: 1em&quot;&gt;K.&lt;/span&gt;]] 00:52, 14 November 2016 (UTC)

:::Whether agree or disagree, you seem not to understand the difference in significance between the written account on 3 different occasions of a key witness/perpetrator confirmed by a scientific calculation from guesstimates of historians.  Well, too bad - {{rpa}}, but hold some power at Wikipedia to its detriment.--[[User:Logicalgenius3|Logicalgenius3]] ([[User talk:Logicalgenius3|talk]]) 05:57, 14 November 2016 (UTC)

:::: Experts include H√∂ss's claims in their considerations. It is not our job to judge who is correct, but only to report what good sources report.  I agree with Diana too. [[User:Zero0000|Zero]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Zero0000|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:03, 14 November 2016 (UTC)

:::::1. [[User:Zero0000|Zero]], your input above is unacceptable, as:
:::::*your statement &quot;[e]xperts include H√∂ss's claims in their considerations&quot; did not prove those considerations [[WP:RELIABLE]], as the experts' results differ (see [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]'s above: &quot;There's a difference of opinion among scholars...&quot;) proving  their unreliability, as variation proves unreliability;
:::::*your statement &quot;[i]t is not our job to judge who is correct&quot; is inconsistent with Wikipedia's [[WP:CONTEXTMATTERS]] policy requiring the editor to judge;
:::::*your and [[User:Dr.K.]]'s statements &quot;I agree with Diana too&quot; and &quot;I agree with Dianna&quot; respectively claimed blind support and thus not consistent with [[WP:Talk page guidelines#Maintain Wikipedia policy]], as [[WP:CONSENSUS]] &quot;does not mean... '''nor is it the result of a vote'''&quot;. 

:::::2. The [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]'s statement above &quot;[t]here's a difference of opinion among scholars as to the death toll at Auschwitz&quot; automatically disqualified their output for the Wikipedia consideration, as not reliable [[WP:SOURCES]], because mutually contradictory and thus mere incompetent (careless) opinions ([[WP:CONTEXTMATTERS]]).  So, the [[User:Dr.K.]]'s statement disproved his own position, as &quot;difference of opinion&quot; argued against his support of reliability.  In other words, [[User:Dr.K.]] proved by himself that what he was rooting for not reliable sources.

:::::3. '''Since''' - as [[User:Zero0000|Zero]] said - &quot;[e]xperts include H√∂ss's claims in their considerations&quot;, than H√∂ss's claims are the only primary source ([[WP:PRIMARY]]), which additionally is confirmed by the scientific calculation of the crematoria's total output.  '''But''' expert's claims are only secondary sources ([[WP:SECONDARY]]) and varying (thus unreliable), and the primary sources take precedence over secondary ('''[[WP:PRIMARY|&quot;[a] primary source may only be used on Wikipedia to make straightforward, descriptive statements of facts...&quot;]]''' which the number of dead is). '''Thus''', according to above mentioned Wikipedia's rules, and absence of reliable secondary sources, the only encyclopedic approach is to use the primary source and not the secondary ones based on that primary one, as they are unreliable (mere inconsistent opinions), because varying.

:::::4. [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] falsely reverted my edit of 01:48, 13 November 2016‚Äé claiming that &quot;David Irving is not considered a reliable source&quot; where the sources were by esteemed Professors [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] and [[Donald Bloxham]].  [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] falsely reverted my edit of 21:35, 13 November 2016‚Äé claiming that &quot;[w]e shouldn't present any one estimate in the lead as being definitive&quot; where the data was not an estimate, but the accurate calculation for the primary source (H√∂ss).  [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] falsely reverted my edit of 23:32, 13 November 2016‚Äé‚Äé claiming that &quot;Your edit has been challenged and removed. Per the [[WP:BRD]] cycle, you need to go to the talk page, where I have already started a discussion&quot; where the inducing the [[WP:BRD]] cycle was based on said 2 false reverts (&quot;challenges&quot;).  In other words, [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] falsely reverts 2 edits and than, based on those false challenges induces thus falsely the [[WP:BRD]] cycle.  It is very clever single-editor [[WP:OWNBEHAVIOR]] prohibited by Wikipedia.  Then, [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]'s [[WP:OWNBEHAVIOR]] gets blind support from [[User:Dr.K.]] and [[User:Zero0000|Zero]], which thus are multiple-editor [[WP:OWNBEHAVIOR]].

:::::This is how you justify a Wikipedia's position.  Wikipedia is not a subject to personal [[WP:OWNERSHIP]].  Please, do follow the Wikipedia's rules.--[[User:Logicalgenius3|Logicalgenius3]] ([[User talk:Logicalgenius3|talk]]) 02:11, 15 November 2016 (UTC)

::::::There are seven sure-fire indicators of [[WP:POVPUSH|POV-pushing]]. They are: 1. Use of blatantly partisan and unreliable sources 2. Relentless edit-warring to support the partisan and unreliable sources in part 1. 3. [[special:diff/749417968|Personal attacks]] to support parts 1 and 2. 4. Walls of text. 5. [[special:diff/749556086|Unsuccessful attempts to change the RS core policy of Wikipedia while in a dispute about reliable sources with other editors]]. 6. Noone on wiki agrees with you. And, finally, 7. Your edits get reverted repeatedly by multiple editors across several articles. I think all seven apply to you in [[WP:SPADE|spades]]. In this case, there is only one way out: [[WP:STICK|You should reconsider your attitude]]. [[User:Dr.K.|&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:600;font-family: arial;color: steelblue;font-size: 1em;&quot;&gt;Dr.&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Dr.K.|&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:600;font-family: arial;color: steelblue; font-size: 1em&quot;&gt;K.&lt;/span&gt;]] 03:01, 15 November 2016 (UTC)

:::::::To clarify, is H√∂ss being considered by editor Logicalgenius3 to be a reliable source? [[User:K.e.coffman|K.e.coffman]] ([[User talk:K.e.coffman|talk]]) 03:39, 15 November 2016 (UTC)

::::::::Yes [[User:K.e.coffman|K.e.coffman]], as being a murderer does not make one a lair, like in the case of H√∂ss, whose initial 3 testimonies included detailed calculations, were scientifically verified, and thus are the only primary source the best contemporary historians rely on, as shown [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Auschwitz_concentration_camp&amp;oldid=749362095 here by citations (1), (2), and (3)].  Simply, H√∂ss had nothing to gain from laying since it did not matter how many millions of deaths he commanded. Adding speculations of old-school historians over H√∂ss's account adds only another layer of uncertainty, which decreases the credibility of the actual number anyway derived only from H√∂ss. Thus, citing other sources than those from esteemed professors and based only on H√∂ss's initial 3 testimonies is less accurate than old-school speculations, and thus not encyclopedic.  That is the essence of the issue here.  You can check everything over, as all is verifiable.--01:14, 16 November 2016 (UTC)

::::::::: You are doing [[WP:NOR|original research]] here.  Who are you to say that a mass murdered would not have a motive for lying?  [[User:Zero0000|Zero]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Zero0000|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 02:10, 16 November 2016 (UTC)

::::::::::No, it is by [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Auschwitz_concentration_camp&amp;oldid=749362095 here by citations (1), (2)] (especially the footnote 76 of [2]) by [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] and [[Donald Bloxham]].  BTW, you need to do some checking before opposing anything or just participating in a discussion instead of just waiting for someone to explain the content of the links provided just above and available by just clicking on the links.--[[User:Logicalgenius3|Logicalgenius3]] ([[User talk:Logicalgenius3|talk]]) 01:51, 17 November 2016 (UTC)
{{outdent}} I have undone {{diff|Auschwitz concentration camp|749968464|749372414|this edit}} because we can't say &lt;u&gt;in Wikipedia's voice&lt;/u&gt; that the data on the museum website is official. The fact that the museums accepts 1.1 million as the official death toll is already present in the article in the section where we discuss the various death toll estimates, and I have added as an explanatory note their breakdown by ethnicity. I've also moved their estimate of 1.3 million total number of prisoners to a different place in the article and stated that it's their data. ‚Äî [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;üçÅ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 06:33, 17 November 2016 (UTC)
