== largest drone strikes ==
BBC's Ilyas Khan seems to have it wrong this time.  [[23 June 2009 Makeen airstrike]] killed &gt;60 and happened in 2009.--[[User:Wikireader41|Wikireader41]] ([[User talk:Wikireader41|talk]]) 19:47, 17 March 2011 (UTC)

== Type of drone ==

The note about a [[Predator drone]] being involved in the attacks was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datta_Khel_airstrike&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=419373009&amp;oldid=419372767 removed] with the comment &quot;I cannot find any reliable source that says this was the drone used; the article on these drone attacks say that another drone has been used in recent times.&quot; According to the [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8388295/Drone-attack-kills-38.html Telegraph], &quot;militants were killed by US Predator drones,&quot; which was the source I used (and then forgot to cite, oops) for the claim. I don't want to add the bit right back in, because I haven't actually been able to find another source, but I'd appreciate thoughts. [[User:C628|C628]] ([[User talk:C628|talk]]) 22:58, 17 March 2011 (UTC)

:I don't dispute that it was a U.S. predator drone. My point was that it's unclear whether it was the MQ-1 predator drone that was pictured or the MQ-9 Reaper that the [[Drone attacks in Pakistan]] article says has been used more recently. I cannot find a reliable source that says what type of drone it was. I edited the intro [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datta_Khel_airstrike&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=419376616&amp;oldid=419373009] to remove any doubt that this was an American airstrike.--[[User:Chaser|Chaser]] ([[User talk:Chaser|talk]]) 23:06, 17 March 2011 (UTC)
:: it would be hard to tell which exact drone ( MQ-1 or MQ-9) was used since CIA/US does not provide details on the type of drone or the weapons used.--[[User:Wikireader41|Wikireader41]] ([[User talk:Wikireader41|talk]]) 00:02, 18 March 2011 (UTC)

== POV? ==

The term ''blood money'' is used in the opening paragraph. Is this not a loaded term? Could the author just say that money was paid?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/83.70.133.9|83.70.133.9]] ([[User talk:83.70.133.9|talk]]) 14:13, 19 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Perhaps. My guess is it was added because that's the term the main article on the incident ([[Raymond Allen Davis incident]]) uses. Don't see any reason it couldn't be removed if you find it objectionable. [[User:C628|C628]] ([[User talk:C628|talk]]) 14:44, 19 March 2011 (UTC)
:In fact, I've swapped the term ''[[diyya]]'' for blood money, as it's both more neutral and more precise. [[User:C628|C628]] ([[User talk:C628|talk]]) 14:48, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

No my point was that it is editorialising - this is an encylopedia. We are not analysing the event.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/83.70.133.9|83.70.133.9]] ([[User talk:83.70.133.9|talk]]) 08:21, 24 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:The articles, [[diyya]] and [[Blood money (term)]] don't seem to indicate it's a loaded term.-[[User:Rdavi404|RDavi404]] ([[User talk:Rdavi404|talk]]) 13:29, 24 March 2011 (UTC)
::Blood money I could see as perhaps editorializing, but certainly not diyya, that's the exact term for what happened and I don't see how that comes across as analysis. [[User:C628|C628]] ([[User talk:C628|talk]]) 14:30, 24 March 2011 (UTC)</text>
