== Title, proper names and capitalisation ==

I seem to be developing a habit of querying articles that appear as TFAs .. anyway, I am not sure why the title and article text capitalise appointment. I am really not clear at all that this event is referred to or known as the &quot;The Lisbon Appointment&quot; or &quot;The Reedman Appointment&quot;, let alone that it should be capitalised as a formal name like this, in both the title and article text. There may be shorthand, casual references to the appointment in sources, but this does not – or should not – create a proper name or quasi-official title known to history. Is this not, yet again, a WP invention? And if it's a bespoke descriptive title, as it appears to be, nor is it very clear, which [[WP:TITLE]] requires such things to be. &lt;small&gt;'''[[User:N-HH|&lt;font color=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;N-HH&lt;/font&gt;]]''' '''[[User talk:N-HH|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/N-HH|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;edits&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 09:01, 17 January 2013 (UTC)
:One of the main sources, Wood 2005 (see the bibliography) refers to it as the &quot;Lisbon Appointment&quot; (with capitalisations) in a chapter title, but apart from that I've seen no &quot;quasi-official&quot; name for the subject. I think the present title is adequate, but my all means don't hesitate to suggest alternatives for discussion (this goes for everybody). Hope you're well, and thanks for the input. &lt;b style=&quot;color:white; background:darkgreen&quot;&gt;—[[User:Cliftonian|&lt;b style=&quot;color:white; background:darkgreen&quot;&gt;Cliftonian&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Cliftonian|&lt;b style=&quot;color:white; background:darkgreen&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;/b&gt; 10:28, 20 January 2013 (UTC)
::As a general point, which fits in with what [[WP:TITLE]] seems to say, I think we should be very wary of naming pages and things after either one-off chapter titles in books – which can tend to the stylised and quirky; and also capitalise as a matter of routine style – or on occasional passing, casual references in running text. Neither necessarily reflect or create accepted formal or common names for things, and hence end up as a WP invention, especially if presented, as here, as a formal, proper name. If we did rely on chapter titles and casual prose shorthand, we'd easily end up with pages here called &quot;Napoleon's Gamble&quot; – a plausible title of a chapter in a book on the [[French invasion of Russia]]) – or &quot;Obama's predecessor as president&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
::Here, of course, unlike in those examples, there probably isn't a standard or accepted name, but at the very least, surely &quot;appointment&quot; should be lower case, both in the title and text. I'd also go as far as to say that the opening sentence, rather than asserting and then defining the name at the outset, should simply describe the event, as it does in the second half of that sentence. As for the title, as noted, if we don't have a formal accepted name, we need a descriptive title; which needs to be exactly that, eg something dry and with a bit more explanation, such as (off the top of my head) &quot;Rhodesian mission in/envoy to Lisbon&quot;. &lt;small&gt;'''[[User:N-HH|&lt;font color=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;N-HH&lt;/font&gt;]]''' '''[[User talk:N-HH|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/N-HH|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;edits&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 16:21, 20 January 2013 (UTC)
:::I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense. I think either one of &quot;Rhodesian mission in Lisbon&quot; or &quot;Rhodesian envoy to Lisbon&quot; would be good. Thanks for this. I must admit I settled on the name &quot;Lisbon Appointment&quot; in an attempt to give a definitive name to the subject, which on reflection was not something I should have done. I'll have a look at migrating the article to one of these titles soon. Do you have any other thoughts? Have a nice evening &lt;b style=&quot;color:white; background:darkgreen&quot;&gt;—[[User:Cliftonian|&lt;b style=&quot;color:white; background:darkgreen&quot;&gt;Cliftonian&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Cliftonian|&lt;b style=&quot;color:white; background:darkgreen&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;/b&gt; 17:37, 20 January 2013 (UTC)
::::Thanks for the considered and constructive response. My occasional quibbles and even complaints about article titles usually get drowned in convoluted and spiralling argument and debate, and/or batted away by the page's primary author, who can be (in my view) over-defensive about their chosen title. I'm slightly surprised the point wasn't raised at the FA and TFA stages, but it's definitely clearer – and yet less assertive about a formal title – now. I guess one other thing is, per [[WP:BOLDTITLE]], ideally something in the first sentence should be in bold (but I can't think what, and it's not obligatory when we have a formulation like this). &lt;small&gt;'''[[User:N-HH|&lt;font color=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;N-HH&lt;/font&gt;]]''' '''[[User talk:N-HH|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/N-HH|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;edits&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 12:07, 21 January 2013 (UTC)
:::::No problem at all; I'm surprised too now you mention it. Thanks for bringing this up, I think it is an improvement here and it has also served as a lesson for me. I don't think having anything bolded in the first sentence is really necessary, and like you I can't think of how this would be implemented as we presently have it. I think it is okay now, but as before please feel free to make any suggestions you might have. Thanks for the constructive conversation thus far and I hope you have a pleasant evening. &lt;b style=&quot;color:white; background:darkgreen&quot;&gt;—[[User:Cliftonian|&lt;b style=&quot;color:white; background:darkgreen&quot;&gt;Cliftonian&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Cliftonian|&lt;b style=&quot;color:white; background:darkgreen&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;/b&gt; 17:08, 21 January 2013 (UTC)</text>
