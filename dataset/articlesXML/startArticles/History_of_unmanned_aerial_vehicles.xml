An '''[[Unmanned aerial vehicle]]''' (UAV) is a type of aircraft which has no onboard crew or passengers. UAVs include both autonomous [[Drone (aircraft)|drone]]s and [[remotely piloted vehicle]]s (RPVs). A UAV is capable of controlled, sustained level flight and is powered by a jet, reciprocating, or electric engine.{{citation needed|date=February 2014|reason=Some arbitrary editor's opinion of what they want a UAV to be is just not good enough}} In the 21st century, technology reached a point of sophistication that the UAV is now being given a greatly expanded role in many areas of aviation.

A UAV differs from a [[cruise missile]] in that a UAV is intended to be recovered after its mission, while a cruise missile impacts its target. A military UAV may carry and fire munitions on board, while a cruise missile is a munition.

==Early development==

===The Austrian balloons===
&lt;!-- the lead definition (not verified) is not compatible with unpowered balloons --&gt;
The earliest recorded use of an unmanned aerial vehicle for warfighting occurred on August 22, 1849, when the Austrians attacked the Italian city of [[Venice]] with unmanned balloons loaded with explosives. At least some of the balloons were launched from the Austrian ship ''Vulcano''. Although some of the balloons worked and successfully managed to bomb The Republic, others were caught in a change of wind and blown back over Austrian lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu/hargrave/rpav_home.html#Beginnings|title=Remote Piloted Aerial Vehicles|work=monash.edu|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrians had been developing this system for months. ''The Presse'', of Vienna, Austria, stated: &quot;Venice is to be bombarded by balloons, as the lagunes prevent the approaching of artillery. Five balloons, each twenty-three feet in diameter, are in construction at Treviso. In a favorable wind the balloons will be launched and directed as near to Venice as possible, and on their being brought to vertical positions over the town, they will be fired by electro magnetism by means of a long isolated copper wire with a large galvanic battery placed on a building. The bomb falls perpendicularly, and explodes on reaching the ground.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific American'', March 1849&lt;/ref&gt; Balloons do not generally meet today's definition of a UAV. Once winged aircraft had been invented, the effort to fly them unmanned for military purposes was not far behind.

===World War I===
The first pilotless aircraft were built during and shortly after World War I. Leading the way, using [[Archibald Low|A. M. Low]]'s radio control techniques, was the ''Ruston Proctor Aerial Target'' of [[1916 in aviation|1916]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. J. P. ''Jane's Book of Remotely Piloted Vehicles''.&lt;/ref&gt; If developed further it was to have been used against [[Zeppelin]]s. Soon after, on September 12, the [[Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane]], otherwise known as the &quot;flying bomb&quot; made its first flight, demonstrating the concept of an unmanned aircraft. They were intended for use as &quot;aerial torpedoes&quot; an early version of today's [[cruise missile]]s. Control was achieved using [[gyroscope]]s developed by [[Elmer Ambrose Sperry|Elmer Sperry]] of the [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/download/ww1-10.pdf Pearson, Lee: ''Developing the Flying Bomb'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in November 1917, the Automatic Airplane was flown for representatives of the US Army. This led the army to commission a project to build an &quot;aerial torpedo&quot;, resulting in the [[Kettering Bug]] which first flew in 1918. While the Bug's revolutionary technology was successful, it was not in time to fight in the war, which ended before it could be fully developed and deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/K/Kettering_Bug.html|title=Kettering Bug|work=daviddarling.info|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interwar period===
After World War I, three [[Standard E-1]]s were converted to drones.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, David, ed. ''Encyclopedia of World Aircraft'' (Etobicoke, Ontario: Prospero Books, 1997), p.854, &quot;Standard aircraft&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Larynx (unmanned aircraft)|Larynx]] was an early cruise missile in the form of a small monoplane aircraft that could be launched from a warship and flown under autopilot; it was tested between 1927 and 1929 by the [[Royal Navy]].  The early successes of pilotless aircraft led to the development of [[radio control]]led pilotless target aircraft in Britain and the US in the 1930s. In 1931, the British developed the [[Fairey Queen]] radio-controlled target from the [[Fairey III]]F floatplane, building a small batch of three, and in 1935 followed up this experiment by producing larger numbers of another RC target, the &quot;DH.82B Queen Bee&quot;, derived from the [[De Havilland Tiger Moth]] biplane trainer. The name of &quot;Queen Bee&quot; is said to have led to the use of the term &quot;drone&quot; for pilotless aircraft, particularly when they are radio-controlled. During this period, the [[U.S. Navy]], continuing work that reached back to 1917, was also experimenting with radio-controlled aircraft.  In 1936, the head of this research group used the term &quot;drone&quot; to describe radio-controlled aerial targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlyradiohistory.us/1963hw40.htm|title=Howeth: Chapter XL (1963)|work=earlyradiohistory.us|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[Image:MarilynMonroe - YankArmyWeekly.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Marilyn Monroe]] was a technician at the Radioplane munitions factory when she was photographed at her job by ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank]]'' magazine in 1945.]]

===Reginald Denny and the Radioplane===
The first large-scale production, purpose-built drone was the product of [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]]. He served with the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] during World War I, and after the war, in 1919, emigrated to the United States to seek his fortunes in Hollywood as an actor. Denny had made a name for himself as an actor, and between acting jobs, he pursued his interest in [[radio control]] model aircraft in the 1930s. He and his business partners formed &quot;Reginald Denny Industries&quot; and opened a model plane shop in 1934 on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] known as &quot;Reginald Denny Hobby Shops&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/dennyplane.html|title=Reginald Denny (1891-1967) - Aviation Pioneer|work=monash.edu.au|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shop evolved into the &quot;[[Radioplane Company]]&quot;. Denny believed that low-cost RC aircraft would be very useful for training anti-aircraft gunners, and in 1935 he demonstrated a prototype target drone, the RP-1, to the US Army. Denny then bought a design from Walter Righter in 1938 and began marketing it to hobbyists as the &quot;Dennymite&quot;, and demonstrated it to the Army as the RP-2, and after modifications as the RP-3 and RP-4 in 1939. In 1940, Denny and his partners won an [[Army]] contract for their radio controlled RP-4, which became the [[Radioplane OQ-2]]. They manufactured nearly fifteen thousand drones for the army during World War II.

It was at the [[Van Nuys]] Radioplane factory that in 1944 that Army photographer [[David Conover]] saw a young lady named Norma Jeane, and thought she had potential as a model. This &quot;discovery&quot; led to fame for Jeane, who soon changed her name to [[Marilyn Monroe]].

The true inventor of a radio-controlled aircraft that could fly out of sight was Edward M. Sorensen as evidenced by his US patents. His invention was the first to be able to know from a ground terminal, what the airplane was doing, such as climbing, altitude, banking, direction, rpm and other instrumentation. Without these patents the early radio-controlled aircraft could only operate within visual sight of the ground pilot.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 2,490,844 filed in May of 1940; Patent 2,408,819 filed May 16, 1940 and patent 2,482,804 filed May 16, 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerial torpedoes===
{{main|Aerial torpedo}}
The US Navy began experimenting with radio-controlled aircraft during the 1930s as well, resulting in the [[Curtiss Fledgling|Curtiss N2C-2]] drone in 1937. The N2C-2 was remotely controlled from another aircraft, called a TG-2.  N2C-2 anti-aircraft target drones were in service by 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;&gt;Fahrney, Delmar S., RADM USN &quot;The Birth of Guided Missiles&quot; ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' December 1980 pp.54–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Army Air Forces (USAAF) adopted the N2C-2 concept in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;  Obsolescent aircraft were put into service as &quot;A-series&quot; anti-aircraft target drones.  Since the &quot;A&quot; code would be also used for &quot;Attack&quot; aircraft, later &quot;full-sized&quot; targets would be given the &quot;PQ&quot; designation.  USAAF acquired hundreds of Culver &quot;PQ-8&quot; target drones, which were radio-controlled versions of the tidy little [[Culver Cadet]] two-seat light civil aircraft, and thousands of the improved [[Culver PQ-14 Cadet]] derivative of the PQ-8. The US also used RC aircraft, including modified [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[B-24 Liberator]] heavy bombers in [[Operation Aphrodite]] in combat on a small scale during World War II as very large aerial torpedoes, though with no great success and the loss of aircrew including [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.]]

The &quot;[[TDN-1]]&quot; was an unmanned drone that was developed for use in 1940.  The TDN was capable of delivering a 1,000-pound bomb but never saw operational duty.

The [[Naval Aircraft Factory]] assault drone &quot;Project Fox&quot; installed an [[RCA]] television camera in the drone and a television screen in the TG-2 control aircraft in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;  In April 1942 the assault drone successfully delivered a [[torpedo]] attack on a [[destroyer]] at a range of 20 miles from the TG-2 control aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;  Another assault drone was successfully crashed into a target moving at eight knots.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;  The Navy [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] then proposed a television-assisted remote control assault drone program of 162 control planes and 1,000 assault drones.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;  Disagreements arose within the Navy concerning the relative advantages of the proposed program for full scale combat implementation versus a small scale combat test with minimum aircraft resource expenditure which might reveal the concept to the enemy and allow development of countermeasures prior to full production.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;  Assault drones remained an unproven concept in the minds of military planners through major allied advances of 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;  Utilization was limited to a 4-drone attack on a beached Japanese merchant ship in the [[Russell Islands]] at the end of July followed by expenditure of 46 drones in the northern [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;  Two hits and two near-misses were scored on the stationary ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;  Several of the later drones failed to reach their targets, but most were effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;

===Pulsejets===
{{main|Pulsejet}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

[[McDonnell]] built a pulsejet-powered target, the [[McDonnell TD2D Katydid|TD2D-1 Katydid]], later the KDD-1 and then KDH-1. It was an air-launched cigar-shaped machine with a straight mid-mounted wing, and a vee tail straddling the pulsejet engine. The Katydid was developed in mid-war and a small number were put into service with the US Navy.

After the war, the Navy obtained small numbers of another pulsejet-powered target, the [[Curtiss KD2C Skeet]] series. It was another cigar-shaped machine, with the pulsejet in the fuselage and intake in the nose. It featured straight, low-mounted wings with tip tanks, and a triple-fin tail.

==Cold War==

===Target drone evolution===
In the post-World War II period, Radioplane followed up the success of the [[Radioplane OQ-2|OQ-2]] target drone with another very successful series of piston-powered target drones, what would become known as the Basic Training Target (BTT) family (the BTT designation wasn't created until the 1980s, but is used here as a convenient way to resolve the tangle of designations), including the OQ-19/KD2R Quail and the MQM-33/MQM-36 Shelduck. The BTTs remained in service for the rest of the 20th century. The first target drone converted to the battlefield unmanned aerial photo reconnaissance mission was a version of the [[Radioplane BTT#MQM-57 Falconer|MQM-33]] conversion for the US Army in the mid-1950s designated the RP-71,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QuEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jLnBT_OmOpT3gAfc2_WlBQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAjgy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Pilotless Photo Drone Takes Aerial Pictures&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1956, p. 144 bottom article.&lt;/ref&gt; later re-designated the MQM-57 Falconer.

The US military acquired a number of other drones similar in many ways to the Radioplane drones. The Globe company built a series of targets, beginning with the piston-powered [[Globe KDG Snipe|KDG Snipe]] of 1946, which evolved through the [[Globe KD2G Firefly|KD2G]] and [[Globe KD5G|KD5G]] pulsejet-powered targets and the [[Globe KDG Snipe|KD3G]] and [[Globe KD4G Quail|KD4G]] piston-powered targets, to the [[Globe KD6G Firefly|KD6G]] series of piston-powered targets. The KD6G series appears to have been the only one of the Globe targets to be built in substantial numbers. It was similar in size and configuration to the BTT series, but had a twin-fin tail. It was redesignated &quot;MQM-40&quot; in the early 1960s, by which time it was generally out of service.

The use of drones as decoys goes back to at least the 1950s, with the Northrop Crossbow tested in such a role. The first operational decoy drone was the [[McDonnell Douglas]] &quot;[[ADM-20 Quail]]&quot;, which was carried by Boeing [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers to help them penetrate defended airspace.

By the late 1950s combat aircraft were capable of Mach 2, and so faster targets had to be developed to keep pace. Northrop designed a turbojet-powered Mach 2 target in the late 1950s, originally designated the Q-4 but later given the designation of [[Northrop AQM-35|AQM-35]]. In production form, it was a slender dart with wedge-shaped stubby wings, swept conventional tail assembly, and a [[General Electric J85]] turbojet engine, like that used on the [[Northrop F-5]] fighter.

===Nuclear tests===
In 1946, eight [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es were transformed by American airmen into drones for collecting radioactive data. They were controlled at takeoff and landing from a transmitter on a jeep, and during flight by a transmitter on another B-17. They were used on [[Bikini Atoll]] ([[Operation Crossroads]]) to gather samples from inside the radioactive cloud. During test Baker, two drones were flown directly above the explosion; when the [[shock wave]] reached them, both gained height, and the lowest was damaged. The [[U.S. Navy]] conducted similar tests with [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]] drones. The B-17 drones were employed in a similar manner in [[Operation Sandstone]] in 1947, and in [[Operation Greenhouse]] in 1951. In this latter test, also several [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]] jets were used, modified into drones by [[Sperry Corporation]]; however, the complex system resulted in a very high accident rate. One of the B-17 drones, tail number 44-83525, is currently under restoration at [[Davis–Monthan Air Force Base]].

===Reconnaissance platforms===
In the late 1950s, along with the Falconer, the US Army acquired another reconnaissance drone, the Aerojet-General [[Aerojet SD-2 Overseer|SD-2 Overseer]]. It had a similar configuration to the Falconer, but featured a vee tail and was about twice as heavy.

The success of drones as targets led to their use for other missions. The well-proven [[Ryan Firebee]] was a good platform for such [[Experimental aircraft|experiments]], and tests to evaluate it for the [[reconnaissance]] mission proved highly successful. A series of reconnaissance drones derived from the Firebee, the [[Ryan Model 147]] Lightning Bug series, were used by the US to spy on [[North Vietnam]], Communist China, and [[North Korea]] in the 1960s and early 1970s.

The Lightning Bugs were not the only long-range [[reconnaissance]] drones developed in the 1960s. The US developed other, more specialized reconnaissance drones: the Ryan &quot;Model 154&quot;, the [[Ryan YQM-98|Ryan]] and [[Boeing YQM-94|Boeing]] &quot;Compass Copes&quot;, and the [[Lockheed D-21]], all of which were more or less cloaked in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav_06.html |title=[6.0] The Road To Endurance UAVs |author=Greg Goebel |date=1 February 2012 |work=Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: USA |publisher=Vectors |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secret projects===
The [[Soviet Union|USSR]] also developed a number of reconnaissance drones, though since many programs the Soviets pursued were cloaked in secrecy, details of these aircraft are unclear and contradictory.

===Vietnam War: Reconnaissance Drones===
By late 1959, the only spy plane available to the US was the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]]. Spy satellites were another year and half away, and the [[SR-71]] Blackbird was still on the drawing board.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagner p. xi&quot;&gt;Wagner p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;  In such climate, concerns appeared about the negative publicity from the foreseen capture of US airmen on the communist territory.  Pilots' fears were realized in May 1960, when U-2 pilot [[Francis Gary Powers]] was shot down over the USSR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagner p. xi&quot;/&gt; Not surprisingly, work intensified on an unmanned drone which would be capable of penetrating deep into enemy territory, and return with precise military intelligence.  Within three months of the downing of the U-2, the highly classified UAV (called RPV back then) program was born, under the code name of ''Red Wagon.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagner p. xi&quot;/&gt;

Just after the incident involving the US Navy destroyers {{USS|Maddox|DD-731}} and {{USS|Turner Joy|DD-951}}, and even before it escalated into the presidential &quot;[[Tonkin Gulf Resolution]]&quot; and war with [[North Vietnam]], the USAF had issued an immediate order for the UAV units to deploy immediately for [[Southeast Asia]] on any available [[C-130]]s or [[C-133]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  The first birds (drones) would be [[Ryan Firebee|Ryan 147B]]s (AQM-34s) piggy-backed on C-130s, after completing their missions they would be parachuted for recovery near [[Taiwan]].

[[USAF]] drones (UAVs) of the [[Strategic Air Command]] deployed to the [[South Vietnam|Republic of South Vietnam]] (RVN) as the 4025th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, [[4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]] in 1964.  In 1966 the unit was redesignated as the 350th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, [[100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]].

The Squadron operated [[Ryan Firebee]]s, launching them from modified D[[C-130]]A [[Hercules]] transport aircraft, normally two drones under each wing, each Hercules carrying 4 drones total.  The UAVs deployed parachutes upon completing their missions and were usually recovered by helicopters which were tasked for those missions.

The [[North Vietnamese]] [[Air Force]] ([[NVAF]]) utilized U.S. Drone flights to practice their aerial combat skills, and although claiming several successful interceptions, only 6 are known to have been shot down by NVAF MiGs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toperczer-p53&quot;&gt;Toperczer (25) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toperczer (29) p. 7, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

From August 1964, until their last combat flight on 30 April 1975 (the fall of [[Saigon]]), the USAF [[100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]] would launch 3,435 Ryan reconnaissance drones over North Vietnam and its surrounding areas, at a cost of about 554 UAVs lost to all causes during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner p. 200 &amp; 213&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-war reflections ===
The usefulness of robot aircraft for reconnaissance had been demonstrated in Vietnam. At the same time, early steps were being taken to use them in active combat at sea and on [[Landform|land]], but battlefield [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAV) would not come into their own until the 1980s.

During the early years, target drones were often launched from aircraft; or off a rail using solid-fuel rocket assisted takeoff ([[JATO|RATO]]) boosters; or hydraulic, [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], or [[pneumatic]] [[catapult]]. Very small target drones can be launched by an elastic bungee catapult. Few target drones have landing gear, and so they are generally recovered by parachute or, in some cases, by a skid landing.  Beginning in April 1966, and lasting through the end of the war in 1975, the USAF successfully conducted approximately 2,655 [[Mid-Air Retrieval System]] (MARS) catches, out of 2,745 attempts, primarily using the Ryan 147J model drone.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The most combat [[sorties]] flown during the war were made by the [[Ryan Model 147|Ryan 147SC]] (military designation AQM-34L) with 1,651 missions. About 211 AQM-34Ls were lost during the war. The highest mission bird was a 147SC, named &quot;Tom Cat&quot;, it accomplished 68 combat missions in Vietnam, before failing to return on 25 September 1974.  ''Tom Cat'' was followed by ''Budweiser'' (with 63 missions), ''Ryan's Daughter'' (52 missions), and ''Baby Duck'' (46 missions).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagner p. 213&quot;&gt;Wagner p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest UAVs in Vietnam were the 147T, TE, and TF ([[Military model]] AQM-34P, 34Q, and 34R).  These machines were 30' long, and had 32' wing spans, with 2,800&amp;nbsp;lb [[thrust]] engines.  These flew 28, 268, and 216 combat sorties respectively; of which 23 AQM-34Q drones were lost,  AQM-34R machines were destroyed, and 6 AQM-34P models never made it home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagner p. 213&quot;/&gt;

==Modern era==

===Battlefield UAVs===
{{main|Battlefield UAV}}
{{see also|Battlefield UAVs in the United States}}
The attitude towards UAVs, which were often seen as unreliable and expensive toys, changed dramatically with the [[Israeli Air Force]]’s victory over the Syrian Air Force in 1982. Israel’s coordinated use of UAVs alongside manned aircraft, allowed the state to quickly destroy dozens of Syrian aircraft with minimal losses. Israeli drones were used as electronic decoys, electronic jammers as well as for real time video reconnaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.draganfly.com/news/2009/03/04/a-short-history-of-unmanned-aerial-vehicles-uavs/|title=A Short History of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)|work=draganfly.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US military is entering a new era in which UAVs will be critical to [[signals intelligence|SIGINT]] payloads, or [[Electronic countermeasures]] systems should be in widespread use following 2010, with the UAVs controlled and relaying data back over [[high-bandwidth]] data links in real time, linked to ground, air, sea, and space platforms. The trend had been emerging before the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|American war in Afghanistan]] began in 2001, but was greatly accelerated by the use of UAVs in that conflict. The [[MQ-1 Predator|Predator RQ-1L]] UAV (General Atomics) was the first deployed UAV to the Balkans in 1995 Iraq in 1996 and was proved very effective in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] as well as Afghanistan.

===Miniature and Micro UAVs===
Another growth field in UAVs are miniature UAVs, ranging from &quot;[[micro air vehicle|micro airial vehicle]]s (MAVs)&quot; and [[miniature UAV]]s that can be carried by an infantryman to UAVs that can be carried and launched like an infantry [[man-portable air-defense system]].

===Endurance UAVs===
The idea of designing a UAV that could remain in the air for a long time has been around for decades, but only became an operational reality in the 21st century. Endurance UAVs for low-altitude and high-altitude operation, the latter sometimes referred to as &quot;high-altitude long-endurance (HALE)&quot; UAVs, are now in full service.&lt;ref&gt;This article contains material that originally came from the web article [http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav.html ''Unmanned Aerial Vehicles''] by Greg Goebel, which exists in the Public Domain.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 21, 1998, an [[AAI Aerosonde]] named ''Laima'' becomes the first UAV to cross the Atlantic Ocean, completing the flight in 26 hours.

===Beamed power UAV experiments===
The idea of using UAVs as a cheaper alternative to satellites for atmospheric research, earth and weather observation, and particularly communications goes back at least to the late 1950s, with conceptual studies focused on UAVs with conventional propulsion, or new forms of propulsion using microwave [[beam-powered propulsion#Non-spacecraft applications|beamed power]] or photovoltaic solar cells.

[[Raytheon]] suggested what would now be described as a UAV using beamed power, flying at an altitude of {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}}, as far back as 1959, and actually performed a proof-of-concept demonstration in 1964, with a transmitting antenna powering a helicopter on a 20-meter (65&amp;nbsp;foot) tether. The helicopter carried a rectifying antenna or &quot;rectenna&quot; array incorporating thousands of diodes to convert the microwave beam into useful electrical power.

The 1964 demonstration received a good deal of publicity, but nothing came of it, since enthusiasm for Earth satellites was very high and the rectenna system was heavy and inefficient. However, in the 1970s, [[NASA]] became interested in beamed power for space applications, and, in 1982, published a design for a much lighter and cheaper rectenna system.

The NASA rectenna was made of a thin plastic film, with [[dipole antenna]]s and receiving circuits embedded in its surface. In 1987, the Canadian Communications Research Center used such an improved rectenna to power a UAV with a wingspan of 5 meters (16 feet 5&amp;nbsp;inches) and a weight of 4.5 kilograms (9.9 pounds), as part of the [[Stationary High Altitude Relay Platform]] (SHARP) project. The SHARP UAV flew in a circle at 150 meters (490&amp;nbsp;feet) above a transmitting antenna. The UAV required 150 watts, and was able to obtain this level of power from the 6 to 12 kilowatt microwave beam.

=== Solar power ===
[[File:Vulture ultra-long endurance aircraft.tiff|thumb|DARPA's ''Vulture'', an ultra-long endurance aircraft]]
In the 1980s, new attention was focused on aircraft propelled by [[solar power]]. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, are not very efficient, and the amount of power provided by the Sun over a unit area is relatively modest. A solar-powered aircraft must be lightly built to allow low-powered electric motors to get it off the ground. Such aircraft had been developed in the competition for the [[Kremer Prize]] for human-powered flight.  In the early 1970s, Dr. Paul B. MacCready and his [[AeroVironment]] company took a fresh look at the challenge, and came up with an unorthodox aircraft, the &quot;[[Gossamer Condor]]&quot;, to win the Kremer Prize on 23 August 1977.

In 1980, [[Dupont Corporation]] backed AeroVironment in an attempt to build a solar-powered piloted aircraft that could fly from Paris, France to England. The first prototype, the &quot;Gossamer Penguin&quot;, was fragile and not very airworthy, but led to a better aircraft, the &quot;[[Solar Challenger]]&quot;.  This success led in turn to AeroVironment concepts for a solar-powered UAV.  A solar-powered UAV could in principle stay aloft indefinitely, as long as it had a power-storage system to keep it flying at night. The [[aerodynamics]] of such an aircraft were challenging, since to reach high altitudes it had to be much lighter per unit area of wing surface than the Solar Challenger, and finding an energy storage system with the necessary high capacity and light weight was troublesome as well.

In 1983, AeroVironment investigated the concept, which was designated &quot;High Altitude Solar (HALSOL)&quot;. The HALSOL prototype first flew in June 1983. HALSOL was a simple [[flying wing]], with a span of 30 meters (98 feet 5&amp;nbsp;inches) and a width of 2.44 meters (8&amp;nbsp;feet). The main wing spar was made of carbon fiber composite tubing, with ribs made of styrofoam and braced with spruce and Kevlar, and covered with thin Mylar plastic film. The wing was light but remarkably strong.

The wing was built in five segments of equal span. Two gondolas hung from the center segment, which carried payload, radio control and telemetry electronics, and other gear. The gondolas also provided the landing gear. Each gondola had dual baby-buggy wheels in front and a bicycle wheel in back for landing gear. HALSOL was propelled by eight small electric motors driving variable-pitch [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s. There were two motors on the center wing segment, two motors on each inner wing segment, and one motor on each outer wing segment. The aircraft's total weight was about 185 kilograms (410 pounds), with about a tenth of that being payload.

Nine HALSOL flights took place in the summer of 1983 at the isolated and secret Groom Lake base in Nevada. The flights were conducted using radio control and battery power, as the aircraft had not been fitted with solar cells. HALSOL's aerodynamics were validated, but the investigation led to the conclusion that neither PV cell nor energy storage technology were mature enough to make the idea practical for the time being. HALSOL was put into storage, and as it turned out, would be resurrected for greater glories later, as discussed later. For the moment, though, it remained a complete secret.

In the mid-1980s, not long after HALSOL went into mothballs, NASA awarded a contract to Lockheed to study a solar-powered HALE UAV named the &quot;Solar High Altitude Powered Platform (Solar HAPP)&quot; for missions such as crop monitoring, military reconnaissance, and communications relay. The Solar HAPP effort did not result in a prototype. Solar-powered HALE UAVs were a concept a bit ahead of their time, and early practical work on endurance UAVs focused on more conventional concepts.

===Amber===
In 1984, DARPA issued a $40 million US contract to Leading Systems Incorporated (LSI) of Irvine, California, to build an endurance UAV named &quot;Amber&quot;. Amber was to be used for photographic reconnaissance, ELINT missions, or as a cruise missile. The US Army, Navy, and Marine Corps were interested, and DARPA eventually passed control over to the Navy.

Amber was designed by a team under [[Abraham Karem]] of Leading Systems. Amber was 4.6 meters (15&amp;nbsp;feet) long, had a wingspan of 8.54 meters (28&amp;nbsp;feet), weighed 335 kilograms (740 pounds), and was powered by a four-cylinder liquid-cooled piston engine providing 49&amp;nbsp;kW (65&amp;nbsp;hp), driving a [[Pusher configuration|pusher]] propeller in the tail. The wing was mounted on a short pylon above the fuselage. The cruise missile version of Amber would discard the wing when it made its final dive on a target.

Amber had an inverted [[v-tail]], which would prove a popular configuration for a pusher UAV, since it protected the propeller during takeoff and landing. The airframe was made of plastic and composite materials, mostly [[Kevlar]], and the UAV had retractable stiltlike tricycle [[landing gear]] to ensure propeller clearance. Amber had a flight endurance of 38 hours or more.

The initial contract specified three &quot;Basic Amber&quot; A-45 [[cruise missile]] prototypes and three B-45 reconnaissance prototypes. Initial flights were in November 1986, with long-endurance flights the next year. Up to this time, Amber was a deep secret, but in 1987 details of the program were released.

Amber was only one of a number of different US UAV programs in planning at the time, and the US Congress became impatient with what was perceived as confusion and duplication of effort. Congress ordered a consolidation of UAV programs in 1987, freezing funding until June 1988, when the centralized Joint Program Office for UAV development, mentioned earlier, was established. Amber survived the consolidation of UAV efforts into JPO, resulting in the first &quot;Amber I&quot; reconnaissance UAV, which first flew in October 1989. Seven Amber Is were built, and were used in evaluations along with Basic Ambers through 1990. However, funding for reconnaissance assets was being cut, and in 1990 the Amber program was killed. LSI was faced with bankruptcy, and was bought out by [[General Atomics]] in 1991, who would later develop the Amber into an operational platform, the [[MQ-1 Predator]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spyflight.co.uk/Predator.htm|title=General Atomics Predator|work=spyflight.co.uk|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. domestic use===
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency has experimented with several models of UAVs, and has begun purchasing a fleet of unarmed [[MQ-9 Reaper]]s to survey the U.S. border with Mexico. &quot;In more than six months of service, the Predator's surveillance aided in the arrest of nearly 3900 arrests and the seizure of four tons of marijuana, border officials say.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115491642950528436.html?mod=hps_us_editors_picks |title=Drones in Domestic Skies? They're in Demand for Rescue And Surveillance Missions, But Critics Question Safety |accessdate=2006-11-07 |author=Jonathan Karp and Andy Pasztor |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-08-07 |year= |month= |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2006, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) issued a certificate of authorization which will allow the M/RQ-1 and [[RQ-9 Predator B|M/RQ-9]] aircraft to be used within U.S. civilian airspace to search for survivors of disasters. Requests had been made in 2005 for the aircraft to be used in search and rescue operations following [[Hurricane Katrina]], but because there was no FAA authorization in place at the time, the assets were not used. The Predator's [[infrared]] camera with digitally enhanced zoom has the capability of identifying the heat signature of a human body from an altitude of 10,000 feet, making the aircraft an ideal search and rescue tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.is/20120629064215/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123024467|title=FAA authorizes Predators to seek survivors|work=archive.is|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2006 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' report, &quot;After distinguished service in war zones in recent years, unmanned planes are hitting turbulence as they battle to join airliners and weekend pilots in America's civilian skies. Drones face regulatory, safety and technological hurdles – even though demand for them is burgeoning. Government agencies want them for disaster relief, border surveillance and wildfire fighting, while private companies hope to one day use drones for a wide variety of tasks, such as inspecting pipelines and spraying pesticides on farms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj1&quot;/&gt;

Recreational drones became popular in the United States in 2015, with approximately one million expected to be sold by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/12/08/very-drone-christmas/bjoMHPmiidy0WHQXy6LjSN/story.html?p1=Article_Recommended_ArticleText#comments&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drones Over Canada===

The Government of Canada is considering the purchase of UAV's for arctic surveillance. The Canadian government wants to buy at least three high-altitude, unmanned aerial vehicles in what could be an attempt to salvage its Arctic sovereignty ambitions. The Canadian government wants to modify the existing Global Hawk drone, which can operate at 20,000 metres, to meet the rigours of flying in Canada's Far North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/30/drones-canada-arctic-global-hawk-northrop-grumman_n_1556163.html#slide=592805|title=Drones Over Canada: Ottawa Considering Purchase Of Aircraft For Arctic Surveillance|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small-player use===
At one time the cost of miniature technology limited the usage of UAVs to larger and better funded groups such as the US military, but due to falling costs of UAV technology, including vehicles and monitoring equipment in their simpler forms, it has become available to groups that before would not have had the funding to use it. Beginning in 2004, the Lebanese [[Shi'ite]] militia [[Hezbollah]] began operating the [[Mirsad-1]] UAV, with the stated goal of arming the aircraft for cross-border attacks into Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armscontrol.ru/UAV/mirsad1.htm Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
