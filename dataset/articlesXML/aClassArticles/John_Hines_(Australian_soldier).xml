'''John &quot;Barney&quot; Hines''' (1873–1958) was a British-born Australian soldier of [[World War I]], known for his prowess at collecting &quot;[[looting|souvenirs]]&quot; from German soldiers. Hines was the subject of a famous photo taken by [[Frank Hurley]] that depicted him surrounded by German military equipment and money he had looted during the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]] in September 1917. This image is among the best-known Australian photographs of the war.

Born in [[Liverpool]], England, in 1873, Hines served in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's Liverpool Regiment]], and worked in several occupations. He arrived in Australia shortly before World War I began and volunteered for the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] in August 1915. Although discharged due to poor health in early 1916, he rejoined in August that year and served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] from March 1917 to mid-1918, when he was discharged again for health reasons. During his period in France he proved to be an aggressive soldier, and gained fame for the collection of items that he amassed, but was undisciplined when not in combat and frequently punished. Following World War I, Hines lived in poverty on the outskirts of [[Sydney]] until his death in 1958.

==Early life==
Hines was born in Liverpool in 1873. When he was aged 14 he attempted to join the [[British Army]], but was returned to his mother after she protested. At the age of 16 he successfully enlisted in the [[Royal Navy]] but was discharged the next year after contracting [[malaria]].{{sfn|Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs}}

During the following decades Hines drifted between jobs and countries, including spending three years in the [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's Liverpool Regiment]] and serving as a guide in the [[Second Boer War]], before arriving in Australia in mid-1914.{{sfn|Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs}}{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Kelly|p=115}} He was a large man and much of his body was covered in tattoos.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Stavrou|2009}} Hines may also have been illiterate, though he was capable of signing his name.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=20}}

==World War I==
Hines first joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 24&amp;nbsp;August 1915, falsely claiming to be 28 years of age.{{sfn|National Archives of Australia|p=1}}{{sfn|Australian War Memorial}} In the year before he joined the Army he had worked as a seaman, engineer and shearer.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=19}} He was discharged from the AIF as medically unfit  on 20&amp;nbsp;January 1916.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|National Archives of Australia|p=4}} On 8&amp;nbsp;May Hines successfully rejoined the AIF, this time giving an age of 36 years and seven months.{{sfn|National Archives of Australia|p=9}} By this stage of the war medical requirements were less strict due to the need for reinforcements to make good the AIF's casualties.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=19}} Hines was assigned to the [[45th Battalion (Australia)|45th Battalion]] and departed [[Sydney]] for Europe onboard HMAT A18 ''Wiltshire'' on 22 August 1916.{{sfn|AIF Project}}

After completing training in England, Hines joined the 45th Battalion on the Western Front in March 1917.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Kelly|p=115}} In June that year he captured a force of 60 Germans during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] by throwing [[hand grenade]]s into their pillbox, and was later wounded.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=19}} He returned to his battalion in time for the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]] in September, where Frank Hurley photographed him on 27 September surrounded by the loot he had captured.{{sfn|Kelly|pp=117–118}}{{sfn|E00822}} Hines was an aggressive soldier and it has been claimed that he killed more Germans than any other member of the AIF.{{sfn|Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs}} Though brave in battle and admired by his fellow soldiers, his behaviour was erratic at times.{{sfn|Kelly|p=116}} The wartime commander of the 45th Battalion, [[Arthur Samuel Allen]], described Hines to a journalist in 1938 as &quot;a tower of strength to the battalion ... while he was in the line&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nepean Times Wild Eye&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article101052440 |title=&quot;Wild Eyes&quot;|newspaper=[[Nepean Times]]|date=14 April 1938 |accessdate=1 January 2015 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hines' enthusiasm for collecting German military equipment and German soldiers' personal possessions became well known within and possibly outside of his battalion, and earned him the nickname of &quot;Souvenir King&quot;.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|pp=19–20}} Although he collected some items from battlefields at [[Ypres]] and the [[Somme (river)|Somme]] region, most were stolen from German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. He kept the items he collected for himself, and there are no records of any being handed over to the [[Australian War Records Section]], the AIF unit responsible for collecting items for later display in Australia.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=20}} Hines sold some of the items he collected to other soldiers, including for alcohol.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=20}}{{sfn|Kelly|p=117}} The photograph of Hines at the Battle of Polygon Wood was published in late 1917 under the title ''Wild Eye, the souvenir king'' and became one of the best-known Australian photographs of the war. Many soldiers identified with Hines and were amused by his collection of souvenirs. The photograph was used as [[propaganda]], and a false story developed that the German Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] had become enraged after seeing it.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=18}}{{sfn|Australian War Memorial}}

Away from the front line, Hines developed a record of indiscipline. He was [[Court-martial|court martialled]] on nine occasions for drunkenness, impeding [[military police]], forging entries in his pay book and being [[absent without leave]]. He also claimed to have been caught robbing the strongroom of a bank in [[Amiens]], though this is not recorded in his Army service record.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=20}} As a result of these convictions, Hines lost several promotions he had earned for his acts of bravery.{{sfn|Stanley|2010|p=115}} He was also fined on several occasions, and the resulting need for money may have been one of the factors that motivated his looting.{{sfn|Kelly|p=118}} A member of the [[3rd Battalion (Australia)|3rd Battalion]] described Hines as &quot;not normally a weak man but rather one ... uncontrolled&quot;.{{sfn|Stanley|2010|p=115}} An officer from the 45th Battalion stated after the war that Hines had been &quot;two pains in the neck&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nepean Times Wild Eye&quot; /&gt;

In mid-1918 Hines was discharged from the AIF as being medically unfit due to [[hemorrhoid]] problems.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=19}} He arrived back in Australia on 19&amp;nbsp;October 1918.{{sfn|AIF Project}} While his Army service file records that he was lightly wounded on two occasions, Hines later claimed to have been wounded five times.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=19}}

==Later years==
Hines was traumatised by his experiences during World War I. For 40 years afterwards he lived in a [[humpy]] made of cloth bags near [[Mount Druitt, New South Wales|Mount Druitt]] on the outskirts of Sydney, and never married.{{sfn|Australian War Memorial}}{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=20}} The humpy was surrounded by a fence on which he hung helmets taken from German soldiers; he became well known to locals, though school children were afraid of him.{{sfn|Stavrou|2009}} Hines was unable to find consistent work, and lived on his Army pension as well as income from odd jobs and selling his souvenirs.{{sfn|Kelly|p=119}} He gained renewed fame when the photo of him at Polygon Wood was displayed at the temporary Australian War Museum in Sydney (the predecessor of the [[Australian War Memorial]]) from 1933, and several newspapers and magazines aimed at former servicemen published profiles of him.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=20}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article183565187 |title=Souvenir King|newspaper=[[Glen Innes Examiner]] |volume=8, |issue=1147 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=4 July 1933 |accessdate=14 March 2016 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia's]] magazine ''Reveille'' in 1934 highlighted Hines' desperate living conditions and stated that he had been unemployed for four years. Several former soldiers sent money to him in response to this article.{{sfn|Kelly|p=119}}{{sfn|McKernan|1991|p=45}} Hines' pension was also doubled, though this income made him ineligible for relief work during the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=20}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article186779713 |title=&quot;Like to meet that bloke&quot;|newspaper=[[Daily Standard]] |issue=6552 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=16 January 1934 |accessdate=14 March 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his poverty, Hines travelled to [[Concord Repatriation General Hospital|Concord Repatriation Hospital]] each week to donate a suitcase of vegetables from his garden to the former soldiers being treated there.{{sfn|Stavrou|2009}}

Hines told a journalist in June 1939 that he was seeking to join the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] and hoped to fight in another war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wants_another_war&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104635392 |title=Wants Another War|newspaper=[[Cessnock Eagle and South Maitland Recorder|The Cessnock Eagle and South Maitland Recorder]] |date=20 June 1939 |accessdate=1 January 2015 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to enlist in the military during [[World War II]], despite being in his 60s, but was rejected.{{sfn|Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs}} An article published in ''[[The Nepean Times]]'' during 1943 claimed that Hines had attempted to stow away on a troop ship in 1940, but was found and sent ashore before the vessel sailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article117892103 |title=&quot;Souvenir King&quot; |newspaper=[[Nepean Times]] |volume=60, |issue=4067 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=11 February 1943 |accessdate=26 March 2016 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28&amp;nbsp;January 1958, Hines died at Concord Repatriation Hospital aged 84 or 85.{{sfn|AIF Project}}{{sfn|Kelly|p=119}} He was buried in [[Rookwood Cemetery]] in a grave which was unmarked until 1971, when the Mount Druitt sub-branch of the Returned Services League of Australia paid for a headstone.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=20}} The [[City of Blacktown|Blacktown City Council]] also renamed the street on which he lived in the suburb of [[Minchinbury, New South Wales|Minchinbury]] to John Hines Avenue, and a monument commemorating him was built at the nearby Mount Druitt Waterholes Remembrance Garden in 2002.{{sfn|Stavrou|2009}}{{sfn|Kelly|p=119}}

A large version of the famous photograph of Hines was accorded a prominent position in the Australian War Memorial's permanent building in Canberra after it opened in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article167911946 |title=Lest We Forget |newspaper=[[Truth]] |issue=3143 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=23 April 1950 |accessdate=14 March 2016 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo was also included in the 2014 redevelopment of the Memorial's permanent World War I exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First World War Galleries- Photograph Portrait Ribbon|url=https://secure.awm.gov.au/media/releases/fww-photograph-portrait-ribbon/?query=John%20Hines|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=31 December 2014|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a short biography of Hines published in 2002, historian [[Peter Stanley]] commented that &quot;'Wild Eye's' bravado conceals a deeper pathos&quot; and he &quot;was a man whose skills in fighting were needed and whose knack for souveniring was admired, but he had few gifts that a peaceful society valued&quot;.{{sfn|Stanley|2001|p=20}}
