== Casualties ==
&quot;hundreds of casualtys&quot; sounds a little bit odd for a complement of 360, I believe that term is usually not used unless it means several hundred persons, which is alittle bit much even if there were more than 300 casualtys.

== Redirected ==
I have redirected this page to the [[SMS Emden (1906)]], because the 1914 ship is currently redlinked. Until that page is written, let this be a redirect. Otherwise it sounds like &quot;Two individuals have been called Abraham Lincoln: the [[Abraham Lincoln|President]] and [[a plumber in Arkansas]]&quot;. -- [[User:Brhaspati|Brhaspati]]\&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Brhaspati|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Brhaspati|contribs]]&lt;/sub&gt; 13:43, 10 July 2007 (UTC)

:As per the naming convention guideline at [[WP:NC-SHIP]], the correct way to organize these articles is to put a {{tl|shipindex}} disambiguation page at the generic name ([[SMS Emden]]) that links to each of the ships, which have themselves been given unique names (generally via the addition of [[hull number]]s, [[pennant number]]s, or barring either of those, the [[Ship naming and launching|launch]] date).  --[[User:Kralizec!|Kralizec!]] ([[User talk:Kralizec!|talk]]) 13:55, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

== Lexicon in Indian Languages ==
There is no reference that Emadan was derived from Emden. But I was able to find that Emden is a Tamil Word &quot;Emden&quot; with a reliable source. Therefore I'm altering the content.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/217.33.241.216|217.33.241.216]] ([[User talk:217.33.241.216|talk]]) 14:09, 21 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Weasel words ==
The article is good, but it is riddled with weasel words refering to its &quot;valiant&quot; captain and its &quot;well-deserved&quot; awards, etc. Yes, the ship did have a remarkably successful career, but these are still statements of opinion that should be removed to maintain a neutral POV. [[User:F-451|F-451]] ([[User talk:F-451|talk]]) 21:13, 16 May 2008 (UTC)

:are you saying the captain was not valiant, or just that this was not referenced? [[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] ([[User talk:Sandpiper|talk]]) 20:07, 16 July 2008 (UTC)

::I think what F-451 meant was more along the line of [[WP:PEACOCK|peacock terms]], but the point remains the same. Unless there are historians who make these claims, such phrases shouldn't be in the article. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 20:56, 16 July 2008 (UTC)
:::It just annoys me when people overclaim in cliches. If they mean they they think the description is wrong and excessively praises someone then just say that. It is absolutely not the case that we do not report opinion, we just do it neutrally. I'm afraid I am a bit prone to be picky when people start using technical terms and mis-apply them. There is nothing weasley about 'valiant' in the sense meant on wiki.[[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] ([[User talk:Sandpiper|talk]]) 10:59, 17 July 2008 (UTC)
::::Exactly, we can and do report on opinions all the time, they just have to be sourced. I've been doing a lot of work on ships of the Kaiserliche Marine, and it is quite difficult to find good English-language sources about them. I've recently been working on the battlecruisers, and I've only been able to find ''one'' book that is actually about the ships themselves (and it's about 50 pages long); everything else is a general &quot;ships of World War I&quot; or &quot;naval battles of the First World War&quot; type of book. If I could only read German...and then get to the German archives... [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 12:33, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

:::::Oh, I know; I've been working on the German WWI ships for probably over a year now; it's only somewhat recently that I've been actively looking for tree-based sources, and had a difficult time doing so. I overhauled [[SMS Von der Tann]] over the past couple of months (take a look and improve it if you can/feel like it), and much of the service history had to be gleaned from the generic books. There's a lingering thought in the back of my mind that if I ever do my doctorate, I'll do the dissertation on some aspect of the German Imperial Navy that requires me to go to the German Archives for information. But it's sort of a pipe dream :) [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 18:13, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

== SMS stands for Seiner Majestät Schiff ==
Should SMS link to [[Seiner Majestät Schiff]], that's a new very short page? Is it  normal to link directly from the '''SMS''' at the very start of the article? Or should we link from some other occurence of SMS? [[Special:Contributions/83.71.71.209|83.71.71.209]] ([[User talk:83.71.71.209|talk]]) 22:33, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
:To be honest, I'm not sure there is a call for a specific page for that, and it should probably be linked to [[Kaiserliche Marine]] where the prefix is already explained.  The only ship prefix to have its own page is [[Her Majesty's Ship]], because of all the different variations that have existed over the years, and the subsequent spin offs such as HMCS, HMAS, HMIS, HMNZS etc mean that this page can be used to explain this development.  But SMS in this case is dangerously close to just a dicdef.  USS is a disambiguation page, and United States Ship links [[United States Navy ships]] which discusses the prefix in the opening section, but mainly talks about the specific ships of the US Navy. [[User:Benea|Benea]] ([[User talk:Benea|talk]]) 23:03, 16 May 2008 (UTC)

::I agree with Benea; SMS is explained at [[Ship prefix]], there's no need for it to have it's own article. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 23:13, 16 May 2008 (UTC)

== Speeding ==
In the 'Madras to Penang' section, para 7, I am a bit uneasy about the phrase &quot;entered the harbour at top speed&quot; (even if it is referenced). A quick glance at the infobox shows that ''Emden'''s 'top speed' was 23 knots. As a fully paid-up member of the land-lubber's society, I would say that the prospect of a 3,000 ton warship coming into the port at that speed would give anyone palpatations!

It might be better if the word 'top' was deleted. 

Thoughts, anyone?

[[User:RASAM|RASAM]] ([[User talk:RASAM|talk]]) 16:46, 18 December 2011 (UTC)
:Penang is an island, and the &quot;harbour&quot; is merely the roads off Georgetown in the strait separating Penang from the mainland. There are wharves and port facilities on either side of the strait, which is about as wide as a large river. I was there in 2008. We anchored fair in the middle and swung about happily, using tenders to get to shore. I expect that ''Emden'' would have simply steamed through at top speed, firing as she went. --[[User:Skyring|Pete]] ([[User talk:Skyring|talk]]) 04:33, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

:: Pete, thanks for responding to my concerns. (I'll try not to forget to watch this page in future), but the fact that Penang is an island and there is adequate room for a ship the size of ''Emden'' to barrel through, all guns blazing, is not clearly explained; I, and most other readers, have not been to Penang. Something like: &quot;the layout of Penang's harbour allowed ''Emden'' to steam through it, firing as she went.&quot; might be a better depiction. The phrase 'top speed' would then hardly be needed, as the impression of speed would be made by the use of 'steam through it'.

== Ship Photos ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-001329, Tsingtau, SMS &quot;Emden&quot; I im Hafen.jpg|thumb]]
The second photograph shown for this ship in this article is actually of the second Emden, launched in 1916, despite the comments on its &quot;official&quot; caption. The first Emden had a much more pronounced &quot;ram&quot; bow and its forward mast was forward of the bridge. The second Emden had a less pronounced &quot;ram&quot; bow and its forward mast was behind the bridge. I can understand why the archivists incorrectly captioned the photograph as photos of the first Emden are almost nonexistent and the 1916 Emden can easily be confused with the first (the 1909 Emden), unless one is a student of this sort of thing. So, I am suggesting the second photo of the ship (in this article) be moved to the article about the second, 1916 Emden, as that article lacks a decent photo and its portrayal here is, in fact, 100% incorrect.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.166.26.178|66.166.26.178]] ([[User talk:66.166.26.178|talk]]) 15:15, 9 April 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:You're talking about this image? If so, you are mistaken; it's clearly the first ''Emden''. Note the three funnels are the same height (compare to [[:File:SMS Emden Scapa Flow 1919 IWM SP 001864.jpg|this photo of the second ''Emden'']], where the first funnel is clearly taller than the second and third), the bow is wrong, and the bridge structure is completely different (compare the bow and bridge to [[:File:SMS Karlsruhe in Scapa Flow 1919.jpg|this photo]]). Compare the photo in question with [[:File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-13, Kleiner Kreuzer &quot;SMS Emden I&quot;.jpg|this]]; it's clearly the same ship, the first ''Emden''. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 00:20, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

::I am in agreement with Parsecboy, also note the forward casemate gun on the hull of the ship in the 1914 Tsingtao picture, clearly visible on the 1910 picture, and the lead in this article, and completely absent from the pictures of the 1916 ship, as the ''Königsberg'' class ships did not have this feature. As to the elements that appear to have confused you, comparing other images all show Emden with the mast abaft the bridge, and the bow shown in the Tsingtao image ([http://www.cityofart.net/bship/sms_emden_colorplan_800px.jpg], etc). That said I will admit it is hard to reconcile the lead image here and the Tsingtao ship (and all the other images of Emden) as being one and the same. The Tsingtao image is Emden, the lead image perhaps is not, as even the earliest pictures and plans of Emden show her with the bow and mast arrangement seen in 1914. The lead image in fact much more closely resembles one of the earlier [[Bremen class cruiser|''Bremen'' class]] of light cruisers, for example compare [[:File:SMS Bremen LOC ggbain 09545.jpg|this image]] of {{SMS|Bremen}}. Perhaps ''The Illustrated War News'' is the one that got it wrong, rushing out an image of a German light cruiser to accompany news of the Emden's loss, but publishing an incorrect picture? [[User:Benea|Benea]] ([[User talk:Benea|talk]]) 07:09, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

:::I think you're right, Benea. It certainly looks like a ''Bremen'' class cruiser. I had a look at Groner's ''German Warships 1815-1945'' and based on the linedrawings of the ''Bremen'' class there, it looks to be one of the first five ships of the class, as originally built. Note that the ship carries the ornament directly on the bow, as the ''Bremen''s did (see for instance [[:File:SMS Hamburg.jpg|here]]); ''Emden'' carried a crest on the side of the bow, as can be seen in any of the photos of her.

==The Emden in film==
I just edited a link to the 2013 movie [[Die Männer der Emden]] to the article and was wondering if there are perhaps more movies about the ship. So I looked at [http://www.imdb.com/find?q=Emden&amp;s=tt&amp;ref_=fn_al_tt_mr inmd] and saw there are a few more pre-world war II films. Some even have a wiki page like [[The Exploits of the Emden]], [[How We Fought the Emden]] and [[Cruiser Emden|Kreuzer Emden]]. Should these older films all be mentioned in the article? [[User:Pindanl|Pindanl]] ([[User talk:Pindanl|talk]]) 16:27, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
:That's a good suggestion - I've added them (plus one more) to the article. Thanks. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 18:32, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

== Number killed on Sydney ==
Four sailors were killed on Sydney, not three. Three were RN sailors on loan, one was RAN. CWGC lists all their names against Sydney on 9 November 1914. Regards, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|crack... thump]]) 09:48, 7 November 2014 (UTC)
:Thanks for bringing this up - Forstmeier might well have gotten it wrong (or maybe I copied the numbers wrong ;). I'll double check later today. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 16:39, 7 November 2014 (UTC)
::Ah, I've found the discrepancy - only 3 men were killed in the battle itself, the fourth died later of his wounds. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 10:21, 8 November 2014 (UTC)
:::OK. There is perennial confusion in Australia over it, probably because the AWM Roll of Honour only lists one dead on that day (the Australian, Bell), but CWGC lists all four. Quite a few of the crew were Brits on loan. Cheers, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|crack... thump]]) 21:05, 8 November 2014 (UTC)

== Cocos Islands: wireless or telegraph station? ==
There is a display about the attack on the Cocos Islands in the Telegraph Museum in Porthcurno, Cornwall. From what I remember from a visit there a week ago, the Cocos Island station was predominantly a relay station for the telegraph network based on undersea cables. Although the station evidently also had wireless communication, perhaps the telegraph facilities were the main target. The German raiding party was deceived into cutting the wrong cable (the axe used is in the museum), but other equipment was damaged.
