'''Vint Hill Farms Station''' ('''VHFS''') was a [[United States Army]] and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) [[signals intelligence]] and [[electronic warfare]] facility located in [[Fauquier County, Virginia|Fauquier County]], [[Virginia]], near [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton]]. VHFS was closed in 1997 and the land was sold off in 1999. Today the site hosts various engineering and technology companies, as well as two [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) air traffic control facilities.

==History==
Vint Hill Farms Station was established during [[World War II]] in 1942 by the Army's [[Signals Intelligence Service]] (SIS). The {{convert|701|acre|adj=on}} facility was built because the Army needed a secure location near SIS headquarters in [[Arlington Hall]] to serve as a [[cryptography]] school and as a refitting station for signal units returning from combat prior to redeployment overseas.&lt;ref name=nsa&gt;{{cite web| title=Cryptologic Almanac |publisher=[[National Security Agency]] |url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Vint_Hill_Farms_Station.pdf |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ap&gt;Baskervill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fas /&gt; The unit on station had a World War II [[Monitoring Station Designator]] of MS-1.&lt;ref name=&quot;abbr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/70575044/Guide-to-Historical-Cryptologic-Acronyms-and-Abbreviations-Pre-NSA-SIGINT-Timeline|title=Guide to Cryptologic Acronyms &amp; Abbreviations, 1940-1980|date=October 2002|accessdate=6 Jul 2013|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/wwii/eavesdropping.pdf|title=Eavesdropping on Hell: Historical Guide to Western Communications Intelligence and the Holocaust, 1939-1945|year=2005|accessdate=6 Jul 2013|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; VHFS was one of the United States' most important intelligence gathering stations during the war, playing a pivotal role in eavesdropping on enemy communications.&lt;ref name=nsa /&gt;&lt;ref name = fas /&gt;&lt;ref name=bam19&gt;Bamford, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the VHFS intercepted a message from the [[Japan]]ese ambassador in [[Berlin]] to his superiors in Tokyo. It also provided a detailed description of Nazi fortifications along the French Coast, and General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] later said the information made a significant contribution to the [[D-Day]] invasion at [[Normandy, France|Normandy]].&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;Baker.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, VHFS became the first field station of the [[Army Security Agency]], a subordinate to the NSA,&lt;ref name=inscom&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schaus |first1=Richard R. |last2=Kovach |first2=Karen |title=M1857 Napoleon Finds A Home At Fort Belvoir, Va., Command |journal=INSCOM Journal |volume=20 |issue=3 |year=1999 |url=http://artillerymanmagazine.com/Archives/1999/m1857nap_su99.html |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the facility conducted [[signals intelligence]] operations and served as a training center for radio-intercept operators, cryptanalysts, and radio-repair technicians.&lt;ref name=fas&gt;Pike.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], VHFS intercepted key [[Soviet]] diplomatic and military communications sent over [[Fish (cryptography)|FISH]] teleprinters.&lt;ref name=bam19 /&gt; The Army Electronic Material Readiness Activity moved to VHFS in 1961 and managed signals intelligence and electronic warfare equipment and systems maintenance for the Army Security Agency and other signals intelligence and electronic warfare units worldwide.&lt;ref name=epa&gt;{{cite web |title=Vint Hill Farms Station: Current Site Information |publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=May 2010 |url=http://www.epa.gov/reg3hwmd/npl/VA8210020931.htm |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gpo&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Army Communications and Electronics at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, 1917-2007 |publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the VHFS's mission changed to research, development and support of intelligence and [[electronic warfare]] for the Army, [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and foreign allies of the United States.&lt;ref name=fas /&gt; In addition, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] took over operation of the facility's photographic interpretation center from the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] and the center was renamed the Environmental Photographic Interpretation Center.&lt;ref name=epa /&gt; In the late 1970s, VHFS was put on the military base closure list, and all maintenance and construction at the facility was halted. In 1981, the facility was removed from the closure list and funding for maintenance and construction was restored.&lt;ref name=fas /&gt;

A VHFS employee told a [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] subcommittee in 1977 that the facility had a bank of machines designed to intercept foreign communications, including those of U.S. allies, such as communications between [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Washington, D.C.|Washington embassy]] and [[London]].&lt;ref name=wapo /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=Report Says the U.S. is Spying on British |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=September 30, 1982 |page=A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tor&gt;Picton.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] reported in 1989 that VHFS served as a &quot;giant ear&quot; operated by the NSA, with its likely target being foreign embassies in [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as international communications coming into the United States.&lt;ref name=ap /&gt;

In 1987, control of the facility was transferred from the Army [[Intelligence and Security Command]] (the successor to the Army Security Agency) to the [[United States Army Communications-Electronics Command|Communications-Electronics Command]], which was based, at the time, in [[Fort Monmouth]], [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=fas /&gt; The base took on a support role, developing and testing signal equipment and supporting the operations of agencies such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref name=wapo /&gt;

The [[1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] recommended the closure of VHFS, which would produce savings of $10.5 million annually. At the time there were 846 military personnel, 1,356 civilian personnel and 454 contractors based at the facility. Most of the personnel were reassigned to Fort Monmouth, while others went to [[Fort Belvoir]], [[Virginia]]. The intelligence equipment maintenance and repair personnel were relocated to [[Tobyhanna Army Depot]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=fas /&gt;

VHFS was closed on September 30, 1997.&lt;ref name=gpo /&gt; The Army and the Virginia State Vint Hill Farms Economic Development Authority settled on a purchased price of $925,000 for VHFS, and the transfer of the property was completed in 1999.&lt;ref name=fas /&gt;&lt;ref name=epa /&gt; Today the site hosts various engineering and technology companies,&lt;ref name=epa /&gt; [[Potomac Consolidated TRACON]] facility and, since 2011, the FAA's Air Traffic Control System Command Center.&lt;ref name=bam663&gt;Bamford, p. 663.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=defcom&gt;{{cite web |title=FAA Moving Command Center to Vint Hill |date=March 8, 2011 |publisher=Association of Defense Communities |url=http://www.defensecommunities.org/headlines/faa-moving-command-center-to-vint-hill/ |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cold War museum opened on the property in November, 2013. At present, it is just open on weekends, but it takes advantage of the historical aspects of the history of the property.

There is also a craft winery (Vint Hills Craft Winery), a brewery (Old Bust Head), and gymnastics school (Bull Run Academy of Gymnastics) on the property.
