[[File:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|250px|[[J. Howard Miller]]'s &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; poster from 1943]]
&quot;'''We Can Do It!'''&quot; is an American [[Second World War|wartime]] [[propaganda]] poster produced by [[J. Howard Miller]] in 1943 for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] as an inspirational image to boost worker morale.

The poster was seen very little during World War II. It was rediscovered in the early 1980s and widely reproduced in many forms, often called &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; but also called &quot;[[Rosie the Riveter]]&quot; after the iconic figure of a strong female war production worker. The &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; image was used to promote [[feminism]] and other political issues beginning in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006&gt;{{cite journal |first1=James J. |last1=Kimble |first2=Lester C. |last2=Olson |title=Visual Rhetoric Representing Rosie the Riveter: Myth and Misconception in J. Howard Miller's 'We Can Do It!'

It was incorporated in 2008 into campaign materials for several American politicians, and was reworked by an artist in 2010 to celebrate the first woman becoming [[prime minister of Australia]]. The poster is one of the ten most-requested images at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;

After its rediscovery, observers often assumed that the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder.&lt;ref name=Design4Victory&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSNo6on0F8EC&amp;pg=PA78 |page=78 |title=Design for Victory: World War II posters on the American home front |first1=William L. |last1=Bird |first2=Harry R. |last2=Rubenstein |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |year=1998 |isbn=1-56898-140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.

After she saw the ''Smithsonian'' cover image in 1994, [[Geraldine Hoff Doyle]] said that she was the subject of the poster. Doyle thought that she had also been captured in a wartime photograph of a woman factory worker, and she innocently assumed that this photo inspired Miller's poster. Conflating her as &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;, Doyle was honored by many organizations including the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame|Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame]]. However, in 2015, the woman in the wartime photograph was identified as 20-year-old Naomi Parker, working in early 1942 before Doyle had graduated high school. Doyle's notion that the photograph inspired the poster cannot be proved or disproved, so first Doyle and then Parker cannot be confirmed as the model for &quot;We Can Do It!&quot;

==Background==
[[File:TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT - KEEP `EM FIRING - NARA - 515856.jpg|thumb|upright|A propaganda poster from 1942 encouraging unity between labor and management of [[General Motors|GM]]]]
After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the U.S. government called upon manufacturers to produce greater amounts of war goods. The workplace atmosphere at large factories was often tense because of resentment built up between management and labor unions throughout the 1930s. Directors of companies such as [[General Motors]] (GM) sought to minimize past friction and encourage teamwork. In response to a rumored public relations campaign by the [[United Auto Workers]] union, GM quickly produced a propaganda poster in 1942 showing both labor and management rolling up their sleeves, aligned toward maintaining a steady rate of war production. The poster read, &quot;Together We Can Do It!&quot; and &quot;Keep 'Em Firing!&quot;&lt;ref name=BirdRubenstein58&gt;Bird/Rubenstein 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gaRRtWEH2pgC&amp;pg=PA58 p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; In creating such posters, corporations wished to increase production by tapping popular pro-war sentiment, with the ultimate goal of preventing the government from exerting greater control over production.&lt;ref name=BirdRubenstein58/&gt;

===Westinghouse Electric===
In 1942, [[Pittsburgh]] artist [[J. Howard Miller]] was hired by Westinghouse Electric's internal War Production Coordinating Committee, through an advertising agency, to create a series of posters to display to the company's workers.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7h4T1DWEECUC&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |title=Smokey, Rosie, and You! |first1=David A. |last1=Ehrlich |first2=Alan R. |last2=Minton |first3=Diane |last3=Stoy |publisher=Hillcrest Publishing Group |year=2007 |isbn=1-934248-33-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the poster project was to raise worker morale, to reduce absenteeism, to direct workers' questions to management, and to lower the likelihood of labor unrest or a factory strike. Each of the more than 42 posters designed by Miller was displayed in the factory for two weeks, then replaced by the next one in the series. Most of the posters featured men; they emphasized traditional roles for men and women. One of the posters pictured a smiling male manager with the words &quot;Any Questions About Your Work?&amp;nbsp;... Ask your Supervisor.&quot;&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Design4Victory/&gt;

==Rosie the Riveter==
{{Main article|Rosie the Riveter}}
During World War II, the &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; poster was not connected to the 1942 song &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;, nor to the widely seen [[Norman Rockwell]] painting called ''Rosie the Riveter'' that appeared on the cover of the [[Memorial Day]] issue of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', May 29, 1943. The Westinghouse poster was not associated with any of the women nicknamed &quot;Rosie&quot; who came forward to promote women working for war production on the home front. Rather, after being displayed for two weeks in February 1943 to some Westinghouse factory workers, it disappeared for nearly four decades.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=McLellan |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-geraldine-hoff-doyle-20101231,0,1376340.story |title=Geraldine Hoff Doyle dies at 86; inspiration behind a famous wartime poster |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjbR9EXABPEC&amp;pg=PA606 |page=606 |title=World War II and the Postwar Years in America: A Historical and Cultural Encyclopedia |volume=1 |first1=William H. |last1=Young |first2=Nancy K. |last2=Young |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |isbn=0-313-35652-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other &quot;Rosie&quot; images prevailed, often photographs of actual workers. The [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] geared up for a massive nationwide advertising campaign to sell the war, but &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; was not part of it.&lt;ref name=Secrets2011/&gt;

Rockwell's emblematic ''Rosie the Riveter'' painting was loaned by the ''Post'' to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] for use in posters and campaigns promoting [[war bond]]s. Following the war, the Rockwell painting gradually sank from public memory because it was copyrighted; all of Rockwell's paintings were vigorously defended by his estate after his death. This protection resulted in the original painting gaining value—it sold for nearly $5&amp;nbsp;million in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5wukQLkavoC&amp;pg=PA399 |page=399 |title=American Women during World War II: an encyclopedia |last=Weatherford |first=Doris |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-415-99475-6 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the lack of protection for the &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; image is one of the reasons it experienced a rebirth.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

Ed Reis, a volunteer historian for Westinghouse, noted that the original image was not shown to female [[riveter]]s during the war, so the recent association with &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; was unjustified. Rather, it was targeted at women who were making helmet liners out of [[Micarta]]. Reis joked that the woman in the image was more likely to have been named &quot;Molly the Micarta Molder or Helen the Helmet Liner Maker.&quot;&lt;ref name=CushingDrescher2009/&gt;

==Rediscovery==
[[File:We Can Do It water bottles.jpg|thumb|left|An example of commercial use on a pair of vending machines for bottled water]]
In 1982, the &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; poster was reproduced in a magazine article, &quot;Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake&quot;, a [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post Magazine'']] article about posters in the collection of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Patricia |last=Brennan |title=Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake |work=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post Magazine]] |date=May 23, 1982 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years, the poster was re-appropriated to promote [[feminism]]. Feminists saw in the image an embodiment of female empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlxHgYqgDswC&amp;pg=PA601 |page=601 |chapter=Rosie the Riveter |last=Endres |first=Kathleen L. |title=American icons: an encyclopedia of the people, places, and things |editor=Dennis Hall, Susan G. Hall |publisher=Greenwood |year=2006 |volume=1 |isbn=0-275-98429-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;We&quot; was understood to mean &quot;We Women&quot;, uniting all women in a sisterhood fighting against gender inequality. This was very different from the poster's 1943 use to control employees and to discourage labor unrest.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Secrets2011/&gt; History professor Jeremiah Axelrod commented on the image's combination of femininity with the &quot;masculine (almost macho) composition and body language.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Diederik Oostdijk, Markha G.

[[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine put the image on its cover in March 1994, to invite the viewer to read a featured article about wartime posters. The [[US Postal Service]] created a 33¢ stamp in February 1999 based on the image, with the added words &quot;Women Support War Effort&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosietheriveter.org/hilite.htm |title=1999–2000 Highlights |work=Rosie The Riveter Memorial Project |location=Richmond, California |date=April 2003 |publisher=Rosie the Riveter Trust |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usstampgallery.com/view.php?id=1352aaaa8d4396c687fbde59ce0e09035b7c418a |title=Women Support War Effort |publisher=United States Postal Service |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/publications/pub512.pdf |title=Women On Stamps (Publication 512) |date=April 2003 |publisher=United States Postal Service |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Westinghouse poster from 1943 was put on display at the [[National Museum of American History]], part of the exhibit showing items from the 1930s and '40s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/small_exhibition.cfm?exkey=143&amp;key=1267&amp;pagekey=246 |title=Treasures of American History: The Great Depression and World War II |publisher=National Museum of American History |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wire service photograph==
[[File:Geraldine Hoff Doyle.jpg|1942 photograph of Naomi Parker|thumb|upright]]
In 1984, former war worker [[Geraldine Doyle|Geraldine Hoff Doyle]] came across an article in ''[[AARP The Magazine|Modern Maturity]]'' magazine which showed a wartime photograph of a young woman working at a lathe, and she assumed that the photograph was taken of her in mid-to-late 1942 when she was working briefly in a factory. Ten years later, Doyle saw the &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; poster on the front of the [[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine and assumed the poster was an image of herself. Without intending to profit from the connection, Doyle decided that the 1942 wartime photograph had inspired Miller to create the poster, making Doyle herself the model for the poster.&lt;ref name=Kimble2016&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rosie's Secret Identity, or, How to Debunk a Woozle by Walking Backward through the Forest of Visual Rhetoric |last=Kimble |first=James J. |date=Summer 2016 |journal=Rhetoric and Public Affairs |volume=19 |number=2 |pages=245–274 |issn=1094-8392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Doyle was widely credited as the inspiration for Miller's poster.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nbcnews&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Chuck |first=Elizabeth |title=Geraldine Doyle, inspiration for 'Rosie the Riveter,' dies at 86 |url=http://fieldnotes.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/12/30/5738254-geraldine-doyle-inspiration-for-rosie-the-riveter-dies-at-86 |accessdate=July 1, 2015 |work=Field Notes from NBC News |date=December 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101123212/http://fieldnotes.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/12/30/5738254-geraldine-doyle-inspiration-for-rosie-the-riveter-dies-at-86 |archivedate=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/us/30doyle.html |title=Geraldine Doyle, Iconic Face of World War II, Dies at 86 |date=December 29, 2010 |last=Williams |first=Timothy |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmot |first=Mark |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/12/30/132484640/michigan-woman-who-inspired-wwii-rosie-poster-has-died |title=Michigan Woman Who Inspired WWII 'Rosie' Poster Has Died |publisher=NPR |date=December 31, 2010 |accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |work=Michigan History Magazine |volume=78 |pages=54–55 |year=1994 |title=Geraldine Hoff Doyle |last=Schimpf |first=Sheila |publisher=Michigan Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an archive of [[ACME Newspictures|Acme news photographs]], Professor James J.

Although many publications have repeated Doyle's unsupported assertion that the wartime photograph inspired Miller's poster,&lt;ref name=Kimble2016/&gt; Westinghouse historian Charles A. Ruch, a Pittsburgh resident who had been friends with J. Howard Miller, said that Miller was not in the habit of working from photographs, but rather live models. Penny Coleman, the author of ''Rosie the Riveter: Women working on the home front in World War II'', said that she and Ruch could not determine whether the wartime photo had appeared in any of the periodicals that Miller would have seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pennycolman.com/my-books/rosie-the-riveter-image/ |title=Rosie the Riveter Image |date=December 30, 2010 |last=Coleman |first=Penny |publisher=PennyColeman.com |accessdate=January 24, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428052725/http://www.pennycolman.com/my-books/rosie-the-riveter-image/|archivedate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has adorned T-shirts, tattoos, coffee cups and refrigerator magnets—so many different products that the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' called it the &quot;most over-exposed&quot; souvenir item available in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt; It was used in 2008 by some of the various regional campaigners working to elect [[Sarah Palin]], [[Ron Paul]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=CushingDrescher2009/&gt; [[Michelle Obama]] was worked into the image by some attendees of the 2010 [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]].&lt;ref name=Secrets2011&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://lisawadedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/sharp-wade-2011-secrets-of-a-feminist-icon.pdf |last1=Sharp |first1=Gwen |last2=Wade |first2=Lisa |date=January 4, 2011 |title=Sociological Images: Secrets of a feminist icon |work=Contexts |volume=10 |number=2 |pages=82–83 |issn=1536-5042}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image has been employed by corporations such as [[Clorox]] who used it in advertisements for household cleaners, the pictured woman provided in this instance with a wedding ring on her left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2007/10/22/trivializing-womens-power/ |last=Wade |first=Lisa |title=Sociological Images: Trivializing Women's Power |date=October 22, 2007 |work=The Society Page |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parodies of the image have included famous women, men, animals and fictional characters.

After [[Julia Gillard]] became the first female [[prime minister of Australia]] in June 2010, a [[Melbourne]] [[street art]]ist calling himself Phoenix pasted Gillard's face into a new monochrome version of the &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/4748630334/ |date=June 29, 2010 |title=We Can Do It! |author=Phoenix |publisher=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[AnOther Magazine]]'' published a photograph of the poster taken on [[Hosier Lane, Melbourne]], in July 2010, showing that the original &quot;War Production Co-ordinating Committee&quot; mark in the lower right had been replaced with a [[Uniform resource locator|URL]] pointing to Phoenix's [[Flickr]] photostream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/348/Australian_President_Julia_Gillard |title=Australian President, Julia Gillard |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:v3jSEN5VM78J:www.anothermag.com/current/view/348/Australian_President_Julia_Gillard+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |archivedate=September 27, 2012 |date=July 27, 2010 |work=[[AnOther Magazine]] |first=David |last=Hellqvist |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://damadesign.tumblr.com/post/866607274/julia-gillard-former-president-of-australia-as |date=July 8, 2010 |title=Julia Gillard |author=Dama Design |publisher=[[Tumblr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/5523564006/ |date=March 12, 2011 |title=We Can Do It! |author=Phoenix |publisher=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Phoenix produced a color version which stated &quot;She Did It!&quot; in the lower right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/4759196620/in/photostream// |date=July 2, 2010 |title=We Can Do It! |author=Phoenix |publisher=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in January 2012 he pasted &quot;Too Sad&quot; diagonally across the poster to represent his disappointment with developments in Australian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/6808410971/ |date=January 23, 2012 |title=She Did It!

Geraldine Doyle died in December 2010. ''[[Utne Reader]]'' went ahead with their scheduled January–February 2011 cover image: a parody of &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; featuring [[Marge Simpson]] raising her right hand in a fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utne.com/table-of-contents-january-february-2011.aspx |title=Table of Contents |date=January–February 2011 |work=Utne Reader |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the magazine expressed regret at the passing of Doyle, &quot;the likely inspiration for the Rosie character&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://utnereader.tumblr.com/post/2585298665 |title=untitled |work=Utne Reader editorial blog |date=January 3, 2011 |publisher=Utne Reader |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] (3D) image of &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; was created for the closing credits of the 2011 superhero film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''. The image served as the background for the title card of English actress [[Hayley Atwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Captain America: The First Avenger |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/captain-america-the-first-avenger/ |work=Art of the Title |first=Lola |last=Landekic |date=August 30, 2011 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ad Council]] claimed the poster was developed in 1942 by its precursor, the War Advertising Committee, as part of a &quot;Women in War Jobs&quot; campaign, helping to bring &quot;over two million women&quot; into war production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/timeline.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216085055/http://www.adcouncil.org/timeline.html |title=The Story of the Ad Council |publisher=Ad Council |archivedate=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/About-Us/Frequently-Asked-Questions |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Ad Council |accessdate=September 24, 2012 |quote=Working in tandem with the Office of War Information, the Ad Council created campaigns such as Buy War Bonds, Plant Victory Gardens, 'Loose Lips Sink Ships,' and Rosie the Riveter's 'We Can Do it.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Conlon&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peggy-conlon/happy-birthday-ad-council_b_1269338.html |last=Conlon |first=Peggy |title=Happy Birthday Ad Council!

The [[Facebook Platform|Facebook app]] was called &quot;Rosify Yourself&quot;, referring to Rosie the Riveter; it allowed viewers to upload images of their faces to be incorporated into the &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; poster, then saved to be shared with friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.helpsgood.com/post/17615327499/helpsgood-develops-rosify-yourself-app-for-ad?ad313a00 |title=HelpsGood Develops 'Rosify Yourself' App for Ad Council's 70th Birthday |date=February 2012 |publisher=HelpsGood |accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad Council President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own &quot;Rosified&quot; face on ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in an article she wrote about the group's 70-year history.&lt;ref name=Conlon/&gt; The staff of the television show [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today'']] posted two &quot;Rosified&quot; images on their website, using the faces of news anchors [[Matt Lauer]] and [[Ann Curry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://allday.today.com/_news/2012/02/13/10395999-plaza-sign-of-the-day-matt-as-rosie-the-riveter |title=Plaza sign of the day: Matt as Rosie the Riveter |last=Veres |first=Steve |date=February 13, 2012 |work=Today |publisher=MSN Allday Today |accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Seton Hall University]] professor James J. Kimble and [[University of Pittsburgh]] professor Lester C. Olson researched the origins of the poster and determined that it was not produced by the Ad Council nor was it used for recruiting women workers.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;
