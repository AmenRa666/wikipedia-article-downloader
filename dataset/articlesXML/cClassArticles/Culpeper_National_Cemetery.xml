'''Culpeper National Cemetery''' is a [[U.S. National Cemetery|United States National Cemetery]] located in the town of [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpeper]], in [[Culpeper County, Virginia]]. Administered by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]], it encompasses {{convert|29.6|acre|m2}} of land, and as 2014, had over 11,000 interments.

== History ==

During the [[American Civil War]], the territory around the city of Culpeper was defended vigorously by both sides, as it was a strategic point almost exactly between [[Washington D.C.]] and the capital of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Numerous battles took place in the region, including the [[Battle of Cedar Mountain]] and the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]. The dead from those conflicts were buried nearby in makeshift grave sites. After the war a reburial program was initiated, and in 1867, Culpeper National Cemetery was established to reinter many of the remains from the makeshift sites.&lt;ref name=vacem&gt;{{Citation | title = Cemeteries - Culpeper National Cemetery

&lt;/ref&gt;

The original cemetery comprised {{convert|6|acre}}, bought from Edward B. Hill of Culpeper for [[United States dollar|$]]1,400. The original [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire Victorian]] caretakers lodge was built in 1872 and was designed by [[Montgomery C. Meigs (1816–1892)|Montgomery C. Meigs]]. Many improvements to the grounds and facilities at the cemetery were made during the 1930s as part of the [[New Deal]]. These [[Make-work job|make-work]] improvements included replacing the original 1870s tool house at the cost of $8,000 in 1934, raising and realigning 912 headstones in May 1934, by the [[Civil Works Administration]], and realignment and re-setting 402 headstones in 1936 though a [[Works Project Administration]] project.&lt;ref name=vacem/&gt;

Having operated without any major improvements since the 1930s, the cemetery was closed to new interments on November 17, 1972. On September 1, 1973, administration of the cemetery was transferred from the U.S. Army to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration’s]] new [[United States National Cemetery|National Cemetery System]] created by the National Cemetery Act of 1973. In 1975 another {{convert|10.5|acre|m2}} was donated by the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], Burton-Hammond Post 2524,&lt;ref name=vacem/&gt; and in 2001 another plot of {{convert|12.3|acre|m2}} was purchased, which has been developed for future interments. The cemetery was reopened to interments on January 16, 1978.&lt;ref name=vacem/&gt;

Culpeper National Cemetery was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=vacem/&gt; It is included in the [[South East Street Historic District]].
