'''Western Area Command''' was one of several [[RAAF area commands|geographically based commands]] raised by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in January 1941, and controlled RAAF units located in [[Western Australia]]. Headquartered at [[Perth]], Western Area Command was primarily responsible for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]], [[aerial reconnaissance]] and protection of the [[sea lane]]s within its boundaries. Its aircraft conducted anti-submarine operations throughout the war, and attacked targets in the [[Dutch East Indies]] during the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo campaign]] in 1945. Western Area Command continued to operate following the end of the war, before its responsibilities were subsumed in 1954 by the RAAF's new functional command-and-control system; the headquarters was disbanded two years later.

==History==

===World War II===

Prior to World War&amp;nbsp;II, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by RAAF Headquarters in [[Melbourne]]. After war broke out in September 1939, the Air Force began to decentralise its command structure, commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units.&lt;ref name=Stephens111&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pathfinder121&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Organising for war: The RAAF air campaigns in the Pacific | magazine = Pathfinder |issue= 121| date = October 2009| url = http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Publications/Details/403/121-Organising-for-War-The-RAAF-Air-Campaigns-in-the-Pacific.aspx|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between March 1940 and May 1941, the RAAF divided Australia and New Guinea into four [[RAAF area commands|geographically based command-and-control zones]]: [[Central Area Command (RAAF)|Central Area]], [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area]], Western Area, and [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area]].&lt;ref name=Gillison91&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 91–92]&lt;/ref&gt; The roles of these area commands were  [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]], protection of adjacent [[sea lane]]s, and [[aerial reconnaissance]]. Each was led by an [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) responsible for the administration and operations of all air bases and units within his boundary.&lt;ref name=Pathfinder121/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison91/&gt;

Western Area Command, headquartered in [[Perth]], was formed on 9&amp;nbsp;January 1941 to control all RAAF units in [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 92]&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[No. 14 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;14 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron]], [[No. 25 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;25 (General Purpose) Squadron]] and No.&amp;nbsp;5 Initial Training School at [[RAAF Base Pearce|RAAF Station Pearce]]; [[No. 9 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No. 9 Elementary Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Station Cunderdin|Cunderdin]]; and the soon-to-be-raised [[No. 4 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Service Flying Training School]] at [[Geraldton Airport|Geraldton]].&lt;ref name=HQ1&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  RAAF Headquarters had maintained control of Western Australian units pending the area's formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashworth pp. 28–29&quot;&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Western Area's inaugural AOC was Group Captain (acting Air Commodore) [[Hippolyte De La Rue|Hippolyte &quot;Kanga&quot; De La Rue]].&lt;ref name=HQ1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; His senior air staff officer was Group Captain [[Alan Charlesworth]].

Other than North-Western Area's boundaries excluding Indonesia after World War&amp;nbsp;II, the boundaries were essentially the same when the area system was superseded in 1953–54.]]
By mid-1941, RAAF Headquarters had determined to form training units in the southern and eastern states into semi-geographical, semi-functional groups separate to the area commands. This led to the establishment in August of No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Training) Group in Melbourne, covering Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia, and No.&amp;nbsp;2 (Training) Group in Sydney, covering New South Wales and Queensland; at the same time, Central Area was dissolved and its  responsibilities divided between Southern and Northern Areas, and No.&amp;nbsp;2 (Training) Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p. 112&quot;&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 112]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashworth pp. xx, 38&quot;&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp. xx, 38&lt;/ref&gt; Western Area, uniquely among the area commands, retained responsibility for training, as well as operations and maintenance, within its boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashworth pp. xx, 38&quot;/&gt; In November 1941, all available aircraft from Nos.&amp;nbsp;14 and 25&amp;nbsp;Squadrons, as well as eight [[Avro Anson]]s from No.&amp;nbsp;4 Service Flying Training School, took part in the search for [[HMAS Sydney (D48)|HMAS ''Sydney'']] after it was [[Battle between HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|sunk by the German raider ''Kormoran'']]; a Hudson and an Anson each located lifeboats bearing [[German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|''Kormoran'''s]] crew.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070478--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 134]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]], Northern Area was split in January 1942 into [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western]] and [[North-Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|North-Eastern Areas]], to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea, respectively.&lt;ref name=Stephens111/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070486--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 311]&lt;/ref&gt; In May,  a new area command, [[Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|Eastern Area]], was raised to control units within New South Wales and southern Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp. xxi, 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, the Air Board proposed raising No.&amp;nbsp;3 (Training) Group and No.&amp;nbsp;8 (Maintenance) Group to control training and maintenance units in Western Australia but, though approved by the Federal government, this did not take place.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; As of 31&amp;nbsp;May 1942, Western Area headquarters staff numbered 247, including seventy-two officers.&lt;ref&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

[[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;35 (Transport) Squadron]], operating [[de Havilland Fox Moth]] and [[De Havilland Dragon|DH.84 Dragon]] aircraft, was raised under Western Area's control at Pearce on 4&amp;nbsp;March 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 481]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No. 77 Squadron]], equipped with [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk variants|P-40 Kittyhawks]], was formed at Pearce on 16&amp;nbsp;March; it was at this time the only fighter squadron available to defend Perth and [[Fremantle]], and De La Rue worked assiduously to prepare it for operations.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;6 Fighter Sector Headquarters, Perth, became operational on 2&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name=Ashworth299&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; As of 20&amp;nbsp;April, operational authority over all RAAF combat infrastructure, including area commands, was invested in the newly established Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters under [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area Command]] (SWPA).&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 473]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers15&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070530--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.  15–16]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some finetuning of Western Area's boundaries occurred in August: as well as the Northern Territory, North-Western Area was given responsibility for the portion of Western Australia north of a line drawn south-east from [[Yampi Sound]] to the Northern Territory border.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070519--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 588]&lt;/ref&gt; September 1942 saw the formation of [[RAAF Command]], led by Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070519--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 585–588]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers4&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070530--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 4–6]&lt;/ref&gt; Bostock exercised control of air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority over all Australian units.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; In November, construction began on an airfield under Western Area's control at [[Corunna Downs Airfield|Corunna Downs]], near [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]]. Australia's closest air base to [[Surabaya]], it would serve as a staging post for Allied bombers bound for targets in the [[Dutch East Indies]], allowing them to avoid Japanese fighter stations between [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070533--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 66]&lt;/ref&gt; De la Rue handed Western Area over to Air Commodore [[Raymond Brownell]] in December 1942; by the end of the month, headquarters staff numbered 488, including ninety-five officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashworth pp. 302–304&quot;&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp. 302–304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1943, Western Area controlled four combat units: No.&amp;nbsp;14 Squadron, flying [[Bristol Beaufort]] reconnaissance-bombers out of Pearce; No.&amp;nbsp;25 Squadron, tasked with [[dive-bomber|dive-bombing]] missions in Wirraways based at Pearce; [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;76 Squadron]], flying P-40 Kittyhawks out of [[RAAF Learmonth|Potshot]] ([[Exmouth Gulf]]); and [[No. 85 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;85 Squadron]], operating [[CAC Boomerang]] fighters from Pearce. The area command was also able to call on [[United States Navy|US Navy]] Catalinas of [[Patrol Wing&amp;nbsp;10]], based at [[Crawley, Western Australia|Crawley]], for reconnaissance and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan ch.09 p. 141&quot;&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070558--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 140–141]&lt;/ref&gt; The Beauforts and Catalinas flew several hundred maritime patrols during 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070558--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 154]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1944, Western Area went on high alert in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force [[Western Australian emergency of March 1944|would raid Western Australia]]. Perth was reinforced with [[No. 452 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;452]] and [[No. 457 Squadron RAAF|457 Squadrons]], and Exmouth Gulf with [[No. 18 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;18]], [[No. 31 Squadron RAAF|31]], and [[No. 120 Squadron RAAF|120 Squadrons]], but no attack ensued and the units were directed to return to their home bases.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070557--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 136–139]&lt;/ref&gt; The US Navy withdrew Patrol Wing&amp;nbsp;10 mid-year, curtailing Western Area's ability to conduct long-range maritime reconnaissance; No.&amp;nbsp;14 Squadron's fifteen serviceable Beauforts had to fly patrols of up to twenty-two hours in duration to search for German submarines reported in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070395--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 349–350]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', pp. 264–265&lt;/ref&gt; As of 31&amp;nbsp;May 1944, Western Area headquarters staff numbered 686, including 118 officers.&lt;ref&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', pp. 359–360&lt;/ref&gt;

Having converted to [[Vultee Vengeance]] dive bombers in August 1943, No.&amp;nbsp;25 Squadron moved from Pearce to Cunderdin in January 1945 and re-equipped with [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] heavy bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberators were employed on anti-submarine patrol off [[Cape Leeuwin]] later that month, owing to No.&amp;nbsp;14 Squadron's Beauforts being fully committed to other tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''A Critical Vulnerability'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Between April and July, No.&amp;nbsp;25 Squadron provided Western Area's contribution to the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo campaign]], supporting the Allied [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|invasions of Tarakan]], [[Battle of North Borneo|Labuan–Brunei]] and [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Balikpapan]].&lt;ref&gt;Waters, ''Oboe'', pp. 18, 78, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Staging through Corunna Downs, the Liberators bombed Japanese airfields in the Dutch East Indies that were within range of Tarakan, up until the day of the landings on 1&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070401--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 454–455]&lt;/ref&gt; They attacked [[Malang]] near Surabaya at night prior to the landings at Labuan, and conducted daylight raids against Java in the lead-up to the Balikpapan operation that commenced on 1&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070402--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 475–476]&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;14 Squadron had ceased its regular anti-submarine patrols on 23&amp;nbsp;May following the end of hostilities in Europe, but remained on standby in case any [[U-boat]]s were found to be still active.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070395--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 353]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1945, Brownell was appointed to command the newly formed [[No. 11 Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Group]] on [[Morotai]]; he handed Western Area over to his senior air staff officer, Group Captain [[Colin Hannah]], who held temporary command for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp. 261, 304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war activity and disbandment===
Following the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was dissolved and RAAF Headquarters again assumed full control of all its operational formations, including the area commands.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;  Hannah handed over command of Western Area to Group Captain Douglas Wilson in October.&lt;ref&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF shrank dramatically with demobilisation; wartime units were scheduled for dissolution in several stages, including reconnaissance-bomber squadrons by the end of 1945, and other bomber units by September 1946.&lt;ref name=Solo11&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;14 Squadron was disbanded at Pearce in December 1945.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  No.&amp;nbsp;25 Squadron's Liberators repatriated former prisoners of war from the Dutch East Indies to Australia until January 1946; the unit was disbanded in July that year.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was placed on the retired list in February 1946, and Hannah again assumed temporary command of Western Area until posted to Britain that October.&lt;ref&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', pp. 523, 531&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46179547 |title=For staff school |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=25 October 1946 |accessdate=18 June 2016 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group Captain [[Bill Garing]] took over as Officer Commanding Western Area the following month, by which time headquarters staff numbered 117, including thirty-one officers.&lt;ref&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', pp. 587, 593&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], proposed reducing the five extant mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern Area, covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The Australian Government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries essentially remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''The Private Air Marshal'', pp. 321–325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solo68&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 68, 462&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;25 Squadron re-formed as a Citizen Air Force unit at Pearce in April 1948, operating {{nowrap|[[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustangs]]}} and, later, [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Vampire]] fighters.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; As well as training reservists, the squadron was responsible for Western Australia's air defence.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; Garing handed over command in November 1948; by the end of the month, Western Area headquarters staff numbered fourteen, including seven officers.&lt;ref&gt;Western Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', pp. 668–670&lt;/ref&gt;
