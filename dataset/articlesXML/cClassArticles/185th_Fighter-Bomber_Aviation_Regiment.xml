The '''185th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment''' ({{Lang-hbs|''185. lovačko-bombarderski avijacijski puk / 185. ловачко-бомбардерски авијацијски пук''}}) was established in 1949 as the 185th Mixed Aviation Regiment (''[[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]:'' {{Lang|hbs|''185. mešoviti puk / 185. мешовити пук''}}) as part of the [[SFR Yugoslav Air Force]].

==History==
[[File:Yu S-49C.jpg|thumb|right|An Ikarus S-49C Yugoslav-made fighter which served in 185th Fighter Aviation Regiment from July 2, 1953, to 1955, now at [[Belgrade Aviation Museum]]]]
The 185th Mixed Aviation Regiment was formed on July 24, 1949, in Ljubljana. It was equipped with various Soviet and Yugoslav aircraft such as the [[Yak-3]], [[Ilyushin Il-2]], [[Pe-2]], [[Ikarus Aero 2]]. By 1953, the regiment was located in Pula, where it remained for the longest period of its existence. That same year, it was rearmed with new domestic-made [[Ikarus S-49|Ikarus S-49C]] fighter aircraft and become a Fighter Aviation Regiment. The regiment was renamed the '''Aviation Technical Group''' of the [[Aviation Training School]] in 1956 and re-equipped with various [[Yak-9]] types. The following year, the first US-made [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|F-84 Thunderjet]] and [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star|T-33 Shooting Star]] jets arrived.

The regiment was re-established as the 185th Training Aviation Regiment by 1960. In that period, [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]]s were introduced into service, in 1964 it became a Fighter-Training/Fighter Regiment.

By 1961, with the application of the &quot;Drvar&quot; reorganization of the Air Force, a new type of designation system was used to identify the two squadrons in the regiment, which became the [[129th Fighter Aviation Squadron|129th Fighter Aviation]] and the [[243rd Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron]]s.

By the end of the 1960s, all US jets had been replaced with new Yugoslav-made [[SOKO]] [[G-2 Galeb]] jet trainers; the unit was re-designated as a Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment. By 1975, 129 Squadron was renamed the [[229th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron]], equipped with Galeb trainer aircraft. In 1978 243 Squadron became the 1st Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron, it was reassigned to the 'Center for training of pilots of foreign armed forces' at [[Mostar]]. 129 Squadron was issued [[MiG-21]] fighters by 1982.

Training of 229 Squadron with a new type of jet trainer, the [[G-4 Super Galeb]], began on December 3, 1984. The 185th Regiment and 229th Squadron were the first units of the Yugoslav Air Force to be equipped with Super Galeb trainers. Six G-4s from 229th Squadron demonstrated the new product of domestic aviation industries at the 1985 [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] parade.

The Regiment was active in combat operations in 1991 during the wars in [[War in Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Croatian war|Croatia]]. G-4s from 229th Squadron were tasked with attacking [[Slovenian Territorial Defence]] barricades on roads held by ground units of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]].

On September 18 and 19, 1991 the Regiment withdrew from Pula military airport to [[Tuzla Air Base]] where it was disbanded from October 30. It's 129th Fighter Aviation Squadron remained at Tuzla and the 229th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron re-located to [[Golubovci Air Base]] in Montenegro on October 10 where it was re-attached to the [[172nd Aviation Brigade]]. 129th Squadron was later moved from Tuzla to [[Slatina Air Base|Priština]], where it was disbanded on May 12, 1992, with personnel and equipment being divided between the [[83rd Fighter Aviation Regiment|83rd]] and [[204th Fighter Aviation Regiment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrijević, Bojan.
