{{nihongo|'''''Zuihō'''''|瑞鳳||&quot;Auspicious Phoenix&quot; or &quot;Fortunate Phoenix&quot;}} was a [[light aircraft carrier]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. Originally laid down as the [[submarine tender|submarine support ship]] ''Takasaki'', she was renamed and converted while under construction into an aircraft carrier. The ship was completed during the first year of [[World War II]] and participated in many operations. ''Zuihō'' played a secondary role in the [[Battle of Midway]] in mid-1942 and did not engage any American aircraft or ships during the battle. The ship participated in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] during the rest of 1942. She was lightly damaged during the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] during this campaign and covered the evacuation of Japanese forces from the island in early 1943 after repairs.

Afterwards, her aircraft were disembarked several times in mid- to late-1943 and used from land bases in a number of battles in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]]. ''Zuihō'' participated in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Philippine Sea]] and [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]] battles in mid-1944. In this last battle, ''Zuihō'' mainly served as a decoy for the main striking forces and she was finally sunk by American aircraft fulfilling her task. In between engagements, the ship served as a ferry carrier and a training ship.

==Design and conversion==
The submarine support ship ''Takasaki'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 20 June 1935 at the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] and was designed to be converted to either a [[fleet oiler]] or a light aircraft carrier as needed. She was launched on 19 June 1936 and began a lengthy conversion into a carrier while [[fitting-out]]. The ship was renamed ''Zuihō'' during the process which was not completed until 27 December 1940 when she was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]].&lt;ref name=p2/&gt;

After her conversion, ''Zuihō'' had a length of {{convert|674|ft|2|in|sp=us|disp=flip}} [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|59|ft|8|in|sp=us|disp=flip}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|21|ft|7|in|sp=us|disp=flip}}. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|11262|LT|t|disp=flip}} at [[Standard displacement#Standard displacement|standard load]]. As part of her conversion, her original [[diesel engine]]s, which had given her a top speed of {{convert|29|kn|lk=in}}, were replaced by a pair of destroyer-type geared [[steam turbine]] sets with a total of {{convert|52000|shp|kW|lk=in}}, each driving one propeller. Steam was provided by four [[water-tube boiler]]s and ''Zuihō'' now had a maximum speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. The boilers exhausted through a single downturned starboard [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] and she carried {{convert|2600|LT|t|disp=flip}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|7800|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|18|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jentschura, Jung and Mickel, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew numbered 785 officers and men.&lt;ref name=p2&gt;Peattie, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

''Zuihō''{{'}}s [[flight deck]] was {{convert|590|ft|6|in|sp=us|disp=flip}} long and had a maximum width of {{convert|75|ft|6|in|sp=us|disp=flip}}. The ship was designed with a single [[hangar]] {{convert|406|ft|10|in|sp=us|disp=flip}} long and {{convert|59|ft|0|in|sp=us|disp=flip}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The hangar was served by two octagonal centerline [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|aircraft elevators]]. The forward elevator was {{convert|42.67|by|39.33|ft|disp=flip|sp=us}} in size and the smaller rear elevator measured {{convert|39.33|by|35.4|ft|disp=flip|sp=us}}. She had [[arresting gear]] with six cables, but she was not fitted with an [[aircraft catapult]]. ''Zuihō'' was a [[flush deck|flush-deck design]] and lacked an [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]] [[superstructure]]. She was designed to operate 30 aircraft.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt;
 
The ship's primary armament consisted of eight 40-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun|12.7&amp;nbsp;cm Type 89]] [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) guns in twin mounts on sponsons along the sides of the hull. ''Zuihō'' was also initially equipped with four twin [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|25&amp;nbsp;mm Type 96]] light AA guns, also in sponsons along the sides of the hull. In 1943, her light AA armament was increased to 48 twenty-five mm guns. The following year, an additional twenty 25&amp;nbsp;mm guns were added in addition to six 28-round AA rocket launchers.&lt;ref&gt;Jentschura, Jung and Mickel, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==
After commissioning, ''Zuihō'' remained in Japanese waters until late 1941. [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Sueo Ōbayashi]] assumed command on 20 September and ''Zuihō'' became [[flagship]] of the [[Third Carrier Division]] ten days later. On 13 October she was briefly assigned to the [[11th Air Fleet]] in [[Formosa]] and arrived in [[Kaohsiung, Taiwan|Takao]] the following day. The ship returned to Japan in early November and was given a brief refit later in the month. Together with the carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hōshō||2}} and six [[battleship]]s, ''Zuihō'' covered the return of the ships of the [[1st Air Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Air Fleet]] as they returned from the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] in mid-December.&lt;ref name=t1&gt;Tully&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1942, the ship ferried [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters to [[Davao City]], [[Philippines]]. ''Zuihō'' remained in Japanese waters until June when she participated in the Battle of Midway.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; She led the Support Fleet and did not engage American carriers directly. Her aircraft complement consisted of six [[Mitsubishi A5M]] &quot;Claude&quot; and six Mitsubishi A6M2 &quot;Zero&quot; fighters, and twelve [[Nakajima B5N]]2 &quot;Kate&quot; [[torpedo bomber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Parshall &amp; Tully, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief refit in July–August, the ship was assigned to [[First Carrier Division]] with {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shōkaku||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}} on 12 August.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;

The division sailed to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] on 1 October to support Japanese forces in the Guadalcanal Campaign and left Truk on 11 October&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; based on the promise of the Japanese Army to capture [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] on [[Guadalcanal]]. At this time, ''Zuihō'' carried 18 A6Ms and 6 B5Ns. The Japanese and American carrier forces discovered each other in the early morning of 26 October during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and each side launched air strikes. The aircraft passed each other en route and 9 of ''Zuihō''{{'}}s Zeros attacked the aircraft launched by the aircraft carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}. They shot down 3 each [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters and [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] torpedo bombers and damaged one more of each type while losing four of their own. Two of ''Enterprise''{{'}}s [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]] dive bombers hit ''Zuihō'' with {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bombs and damaged her flight deck enough that she could not conduct flight operations although she was not seriously damaged otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, pp. 292–96&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the damaged ''Shōkaku'', the ship withdrew from the battle and reached Truk two days later. After temporary repairs, the two carriers returned to Japan in early November and ''Zuihō''{{'}}s repairs were completed on 16 December. In the meantime, Captain [[Bunjiro Yamaguchi]] assumed command.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;

The ship left [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] on 17 January 1943 and sailed for Truk with a load of aircraft. Upon arrival she was assigned to the [[Second Carrier Division]] to provide cover for the evacuation of Guadalcanal, along with {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'yō||2}} and ''Zuikaku'', later in the month and in early February. ''Zuihō''{{'}}s fighters were transferred to [[Wewak]], [[New Guinea]] in mid-February and then to Kavieng in early March. They were transferred to Rabaul on mid-March to participate in [[Operation I-Go]], a land-based aerial offensive against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The fighters returned to Truk on 18 March after claiming 18 Allied aircraft shot down.&lt;ref&gt;Hata &amp; Izawa, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zuihō'' arrived at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] on 9 May and received a brief refit in mid-June. She returned to Truk on 15 July and remained in the area until 5 November when she returned to [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]].&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; Her air group, 18 Zeros and eight D3As, was briefly deployed to Kavieng in late August – early September before returning to Truk.&lt;ref name=h6&gt;Hata &amp; Izawa, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, ''Zuihō'' was assigned to the First Carrier Division with ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'' and they sailed for [[Eniwetok]] [[Atoll]] on 18 September for training and to be in position to intercept any attacks by American carriers in the vicinity of [[Wake Island]] and the [[Marshall Islands]] area. That day the American carriers raided the [[Gilbert Islands]] and were gone by the time the Japanese reached Eniwetok on 20 September. Japanese intelligence reports pointed to another American attack in the Wake-Marshall Islands area in mid-October and Admiral [[Mineichi Koga]] sortied the Combined Fleet, including the First Carrier Division, on 17 October. They arrived at Eniwetok two days later and waited for reports of American activity until 23 October. They then sailed for Wake Island and then returned to Truk on 26 October without encountering any American ships.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zuiho1944.png|right|450px|thumb|Three-way view of ''Zuihō'']]
''Zuihō''{{'}}s air group was transferred to Rabaul at the beginning of November, just in time to participate in the [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|raid on Rabaul]] a few days later. The fighters claimed to have shot down 25 American aircraft at the cost of 8 of their own; the survivors flew back to Truk where they remained.&lt;ref name=h6/&gt; On 30 November, ''Zuihō'', together with the [[escort carrier]]s {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Chūyō||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Unyō||2}}, departed Truk for Japan, escorted by four [[destroyer]]s. The Americans had [[Magic (cryptography)|cracked the Japanese naval codes]] and positioned several submarines along their route to Yokosuka. {{USS|Skate|SS-305|2}} unsuccessfully attacked ''Zuihō'' on 30 November, while {{USS|Sailfish|SS-192|2}} torpedoed and sank ''Chūyō'' five days later with heavy loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; From December to May 1944, ''Zuihō'' ferried aircraft and supplies to Truk and Guam although she was reassigned to the Third Carrier Division on 29 January,&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; together with the converted carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Chitose||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Chiyoda||2}}. Each of the three carriers was intended to be equipped with 21 fighters and 9 torpedo bombers, but this plan was changed on 15 February to a consolidated air group, the 653rd, that controlled the aircraft of all three carriers.&lt;ref name=h6/&gt; While fully equipped by May with 18 Zero fighters, 45 Zero [[fighter-bomber]]s, 18 B5Ns, and 9 [[Nakajima B6N]] &quot;Jill&quot; torpedo bombers,&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; the air group's pilots were largely drawn from the two most recent classes and lacked experience.&lt;ref name=h3&gt;Hata &amp; Izawa, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The ship sailed for [[Tawi-Tawi]] on 11 May in the Philippines. The new base was closer to the oil wells in [[Borneo]] on which the Navy relied and also to the [[Palau]] and western Caroline Islands where the Japanese expected the next American attack. However, the location lacked an airfield on which to train the green pilots and American submarines were very active in the vicinity which restricted the ships to the anchorage.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, pp. 380–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===
{{main|Battle of the Philippine Sea}}
The [[1st Mobile Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Mobile Fleet]] was en route to Guimares Island in the central Philippines on 13 June, where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines, when [[Vice Admiral]] [[Jisaburō Ozawa]] learned of the American attack on the [[Mariana Islands]] the previous day. Upon reaching Guimares, the fleet refueled and sortied into the [[Philippine Sea]] where they spotted [[Task Force 58]] on 18 June. The Americans failed to locate Ozawa's ships that day and the Japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and the American carriers as Ozawa had decided on launching his air strikes early the following morning. He had deployed his forces in a &quot;T&quot;- shaped formation with the 3rd Carrier Division at the end of the stem, {{convert|115|nmi}} ahead of the 1st and 2nd Carrier Divisions that formed the crossbar of the &quot;T&quot;. ''Zuihō'' and her consorts were intended to draw the attentions of the Americans while the other carriers conducted their air strikes without disruption. Sixteen [[Aichi E13A]] [[floatplane]]s were launched by the [[heavy cruiser]]s accompanying the carriers at 04:30 to search for the Americans; the three carriers launched a follow up wave of 13 B5Ns at 05:20. The first wave spotted one group of four carriers from Task Force 58 at 07:34 and the Japanese carriers launched their aircraft an hour later. This consisted of 43 Zero fighter-bombers and 7 B6Ns, escorted by 14 A6M5 fighters; the carriers retained only 3 fighters, 2 fighter-bombers, 2 B6Ns and 2 B5Ns for self-defense and later searches. While the air strike was still forming up, the second wave of searchers located Task Force 58's battleships and the air strike was diverted to attack them. The Americans detected the incoming Japanese aircraft at 09:59 and had a total of 199 [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]] fighters in the air by the time the Japanese aircraft were in range of the American ships. The defending fighters decimated the Japanese aircraft and only 21 survived. The only damage inflicted was from one A6M2 that hit the battleship {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} in her superstructure with a single {{convert|250|kg|adj=on}} bomb that wounded 50 crewmen, but did little other damage. Only 3 Hellcats were lost in the affair, one to a B6N, although the Japanese claimed four victories. Some of the surviving Japanese aircraft landed at Guam while others, including the five surviving B6Ns, returned to their carriers where they claimed one carrier definitely damaged and another probably hit.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 258–60&lt;/ref&gt;

At dusk, the Japanese turned away to the northwest to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. Both sides launched aircraft the next day to locate each other; ''Zuihō'' launched three aircraft at 12:00 to search east of the fleet, but they did not discover the Americans. The Americans discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon and Vice Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]] ordered an air strike launched. While they sank the carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiyō||2}} and damaged two others, ''Zuihō'' was not attacked and successfully disengaged that evening.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 263–65&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the battle, Air Group 653 was reduced to 2 Zero fighters, 3 Zero fighter-bombers and 6 torpedo bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Hata &amp; Izawa, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching Japan on 1 July, the ship remained in Japanese waters until October,&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; training replacements for her air group.&lt;ref name=h5&gt;Hata &amp; Izawa, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Leyte Gulf===
{{main|Battle of Leyte Gulf}}
[[File:Japanese Aircraft Carrier Zuiho.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Zuihō'' during the Battle of Cape Engaño|alt=Zuihō during the Battle of Cape Engaño]]
After the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the commander of the [[Combined Fleet]], Admiral [[Soemu Toyoda]], prepared four &quot;victory&quot; plans: ''Shō-Gō'' 1 ({{lang|ja|捷１号作戦}} ''{{lang|ja-Latn|Shō ichigō sakusen}}'') was a major naval operation in the Philippines, while Shō-Gō 2 was intended to defend Formosa, the [[Ryukyu Islands]] and southern Kyushu. Shō-Gō 3 and Shō-Gō 4 were responses to attacks on [[Kyushu]]-[[Shikoku]]-[[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; He activated Shō-Gō 2 after the Americans [[Formosa Air Battle|attacked]] the Philippines, Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; This required the transfer of most of Air Group 652 to Formosa and [[Luzon]] to attack the American forces, with only a few aircraft retained for carrier operations.&lt;ref name=h5/&gt; Most of these aircraft were lost for little gain as the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines, preparatory to the actual invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October, Admiral Toyoda alerted the fleet that Shō-Gō 1 was imminent and activated the plan the following day after receiving reports of the landings on [[Leyte]]. ''Zuihō''{{'}}s role in Shō-Gō 1, together with ''Chiyoda'', ''Chitose'' and ''Zuikaku'' and the rest of the Main Body of the 1st Mobile Fleet, approaching [[Leyte Gulf]] from the north, was to serve as decoys to attract attention away from the two other forces approaching from the south and west. All forces were to converge on Leyte Gulf on 25 October and the Main Body left Japan on 20 October. As decoys, the carriers were only provided with a total of 116 aircraft: 52 Zero fighters, 28 Zero fighter-bombers, 7 [[Yokosuka D4Y]] &quot;Judy&quot; dive bombers, 26 B6N and 4 B5N torpedo bombers. By the morning of 24 October, the Main Body was within range of the northernmost American carriers of [[Task Force 38]] and Admiral Ozawa ordered an air strike launched to attract the attention of the Americans. This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters; the survivors landed at airfields on Luzon. The Americans were preoccupied dealing with the other Japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks launched from Luzon and Leyte and could not spare any aircraft to search for the Japanese carriers until the afternoon. They finally found them at 16:05, but Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.]], commander of Task Force 38, decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike. He did, however, turn all of his ships north to position himself for a dawn attack on the Japanese carriers the next day in what came to be called the [[Battle of Cape Engaño]].&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, pp. 420, 422, 428&lt;/ref&gt;

Aircraft from the light carrier {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|2}} were able to track the Japanese ships for most of the night and Halsey ordered an air strike of 60 Hellcat fighters, 65 Helldiver dive bombers and 55 Avenger torpedo bombers launched shortly after dawn in anticipation of locating the Japanese fleet. They spotted them at 07:35 and brushed aside the 13 Zeros that the Japanese had retained for self-defense. ''Zuihō'' attempted to launch her few remaining aircraft, but was hit by a single bomb on her aft flight deck after a number of torpedo-carrying Avengers missed.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, pp. 429–30&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb started several small fires, lifted the rear elevator, bulged the flight deck, knocked out steering and gave the ship a small [[list (watercraft)|list]] to port. Twenty minutes later, the fires were put out, steering repaired and the list corrected. A second attack an hour later focused on ''Chiyoda'' and ignored ''Zuihō''. The third wave arrived around 1300 and badly damaged the ship. She was hit once by a torpedo and twice by small bombs, although fragments from as many as 67 near misses cut steam pipes and caused flooding of both engine rooms and one boiler room. ''Zuihō'' was forced to reduce speed to {{convert|12|kn}} and flooding increased so that all available hands were ordered to man the pumps at 14:10. The ship took on a 13° list to starboard and went dead in the water at 14:45 when the port engine room fully flooded. A fourth wave of American aircraft attacked ten minutes later, but only damaged her with splinters from another ten near misses. This was enough to increase her list to 23° and she was ordered abandoned at 15:10. ''Zuihō'' sank at 15:26 at position {{Coord|19|20|N|125|15|E|display=inline,title}} with the loss of 7 officers and 208 men. The destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Kuwa|1944|2}} and the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Ise||2}} rescued 58 officers and 701 men between them.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;
