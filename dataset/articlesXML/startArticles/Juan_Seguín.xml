'''Juan Nepomuceno Seguín''' (October 27, 1806 – August 27, 1890) was a political and military figure of the [[Texas Revolution]] helping to establish the independence of [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Juan-Seguin |title=Juan Seguin Biography | publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |date= |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous places and institutions are named in his honor, including the county seat of [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]] in [[Guadalupe County, Texas|Guadalupe County]], the Juan N. Seguin Memorial Interchange in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Juan Seguin Monument in Seguin, World War II Liberty Ship SS Juan N. Seguin, [[Seguin High School (Arlington, Texas)|Seguin High School]] in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]].

==Early life==
Juan Nepomuceno Seguin was born on October 27, 1806, in [[San Antonio de Bexar]], [[Spanish Texas|Province of Texas]], [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]],  to [[Erasmo Seguin|Juan José María Erasmo Seguin]] and Maria Josefa Becerra. As the son of a postmaster, he assisted his mother in the business, while his father was off writing the Mexican Constitution of 1824. In 1825, he married María Gertrudis Flores de Abrego. They had ten children. He was elected an alderman in December, 1828 and served on numerous electoral boards before becoming the San Antonio alcalde (mayor) in December 1833. He then served as political chief of Bexar in 1834, when the previous chief became ill. In 1835, he led a relief force to Monclova, when the Federalist Governor appealed for help.&lt;ref name=TSHA&gt;{{cite web|title=Juan Nepumuceno Seguin|last=Teja|first=Jesús F. de la|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fse08|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas Revolution==
{{main|Texas Revolution}}
As a teenager in Mexico, he had a strong interest in politics. When [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] repealed the Mexican Constitution of 1824, Seguin was very critical of his contemporary Mexican leader. Years later Seguin gladly joined the Texas Revolution to rid the area of Santa Anna's rule.&lt;ref name=Todish109&gt;Todish (1998), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835–1836, Seguin recruited and commanded troops for the [[Texian Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja77&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=Note&gt;Juan Seguin married María Gertrudis Flores de Abrego, a member of one of San Antonio's well known ranching families. There were four Jose Flores De Abrego sons, (brothers-in-law to Juan Seguin), who joined in with him. (see de la Teja (1991), p. 18) Captain [[Salvador Flores]], Captain [[Manuel N. Flores]], Lieutenant Nepomuceno Flores, and Private Jose Maria Flores all participated in the Texas Revolution, on the Texian side.&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned a captain by [[Stephen F. Austin]] in October 1835&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja135&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; and was tasked with supplying the Texian troops with food and provisions.&lt;ref name=Edmonson219&gt;Edmonson (2000), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Juan sent out scouting parties to the [[San Antonio Missions National Historical Park|Missions of San Antonio]] in search of a suitable base camp for the Texians &lt;ref name=hardin29&gt;Hardin (1994), pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in the early successful [[Battle of Concepcion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja78&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martín Perfecto de Cos]] was appointed as military governor over Texas by his brother-in-law [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], and established his headquarters in San Antonio on October 9, 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Menchaca, Poche, Matovina, de la Teja (2013), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Upwards of 160 ''rancheros'' (Mexican ranch owners) and other Tejanos under Seguín, [[José María Jesús Carbajal|José Carbajal]], [[Plácido Benavides]], [[Salvador Flores]] and Manuel Leal joined Austin and approximately 400 Texians at the [[Siege of Béxar]].&lt;ref name=Lozano34&gt;Lozano (1985), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lozano34/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zamora, Orozco, Rocha (2000), pp. 35–49 Occupied Texas: Béxar and Goliad, 1835–1836 (Paul D. Lack)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poyo (1996), p. 53, Efficient in the Cause (Stephen L. Harden)&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-month battle, Cos surrendered on December 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surrender terms signed by General Cos and General Burleson at San Antonio, December 11, 1835|url=https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/republic/Béxar/cos1.html||publisher=Texas State Library and Archives Commission|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1836, Seguín was commissioned as a Captain in the regular Texas army.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;According to records, Seguin did not appear at the Convention to accept his appointment in the regular army; Jesus (Comanche) Cuellar filled in for him. He instead took the position to become the first judge of San Antonio. According to Lindley, he was not regular army until after departing from the Alamo as a courier on February 25. See de la Teja pg.79, Lindley pg.113&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the return of Santa Anna's army, Juan joined [[William B. Travis]] on February 23, in the [[Battle of the Alamo]].&lt;ref name=groneman98&gt;Groneman (1998), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Although serving at the [[Alamo]] during the thirteen-day [[Siege of the Alamo|siege]], he did not actually participate in the final battle of the Alamo &lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja79&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was chosen to carry the Alamo message through enemy lines,&lt;ref name=Lord111&gt;Lord (1961), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; that the Texans &quot;shall never surrender or retreat.&quot; Seguín got that message through to the other soldiers on the Texian side.&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja79&quot;/&gt; He then returned with men to reinforce the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]], but it had already fallen to Santa Anna's army.&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja80&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|right|320px|''Surrender of Santa Anna'' by William Huddle, depicts Santa Anna's surrender to the wounded Sam Houston, while Juan Seguín views the proceedings.]]
After the Alamo, he re-formed cavalry companies at Gonzales and acted as the rear guard, providing protection for fleeing Texas families during the [[Runaway Scrape]]&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja81&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; His company, with Captain Moseley Baker's company, blocked the Mexican army from crossing the Brazos river, preventing them from overtaking the Texians.&lt;ref name=groneman98/&gt; His cavalry command, participating as infantry with Sherman's company, fought in the victorious [[Battle of San Jacinto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja83&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindley160&gt;Lindley (2003), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1836, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref name=Lozano36&gt;Lozano (1985), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, as a representative of the [[Republic of Texas]], he accepted the formal surrender of the Mexican forces in the Alamo.

==Life under the Republic of Texas==
After Texas became a  Republic, he was the head of the San Antonio military, commanding a force to defend the western frontier.&lt;ref name=Matovina19&gt;Matavoina (1995), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas army Brigadier General [[Felix Huston]] ordered Seguín in early 1837 to arrange for burial of the Alamo defenders' remains that had been left where they were burned. Ashes were identified and collected at three unrecorded sites. Prior to the February 25 funeral, the casket lay in &quot;the parish church&quot;. The March 28, 1837 issue of the ''[[Telegraph and Texas Register]]'' account provided by Seguin states they were buried where the majority of ashes had been found, but was not specific about the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telegraph and Texas Register May 28, 1837|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth47925/m1/2/zoom/?q=Juan%20Seguin&amp;zoom=3&amp;lat=6719.5&amp;lon=4156&amp;layers=BT|website=The Portal to Texas History|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told historian Reuben Potter in 1861 that the site was in a peach orchard near the mission. Twenty-eight years later in correspondence with [[Hamilton P. Bee]], Seguín remembered placing the remains in a tomb inside the &quot;Cathedral of San Antonio&quot;.&lt;ref name=McAdams&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Burial Place of the Alamo Heroes|first=Marilyn McAdams|last= Sibley|journal=The Southwestern Historical Quarterly|volume= 70| issue =  2|date=October 1966|pages= 272–280|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|jstor=30236392|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remains believed to be those of the Alamo defenders were discovered at the [[Cathedral of San Fernando]] in 1936, the battle's centennial. Time had decayed their original container, and they were re-interred in a marble [[sarcophagus]]. Purported to hold the ashes of Travis, Bowie and Crockett, some have doubted it can be proven whose remains are entombed there.&lt;ref name=McAdams/&gt;

Seguín was elected as a Texas Senator from 1837 to 1840 and worked closely with Congressman [[José Antonio Navarro]] to ensure legislation that would be in the best interest of the citizenry of Texas, who were quickly becoming the political minority. In 1839, Seguín, captain of a Texas force of about fifty-four men, again protected the colonists in the [[Henry Karnes]] campaign against the hostile [[Comanche]] Indians.&lt;ref name=Moore228&gt;Moore (2006), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1839, at a town thirty miles east of San Antonio, he was honored by parade and celebration; that newly named town would now bear his own name, [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]]. In 1840, he resigned his congressional seat in order to join a controversial campaign against the Centralist government in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;Todish (1998), p. 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt;  Juan became mayor of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] in 1841.

Texas became flooded with adventurous and land-hungry North Americans who were unfamiliar with the native Texans' history&lt;ref name=Edmonson412&gt;Edmonson (2000), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; and their loyal support of Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja113&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Seguin's leadership and loyalty was challenged by these newcomers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nofi8586&quot;&gt;Nofi (1992, pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Refusing to burn San Antonio to the ground by order of the new [[Felix Huston|head of the Texas military]] was just the beginning.&lt;ref name=groneman98/&gt;

In 1842, San Antonio was overrun once by [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]'s forces. During March 1842, Colonel Seguin and the citizens of San Antonio sought refuge at [[Manuel N. Flores|Manuel Flores]]' Ranch in the city of [[Seguin, Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja116&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; A counterattack was planned, and even though Seguín pursued the army of [[Ráfael Vásquez]], chasing them from Texas,&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja117&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; he was deemed to be to blame for the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja118&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seguín resigned from office in April, due to threats on his life.&lt;ref name=groneman99&gt;Groneman (1998), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  Opposition to his defense of Texas rights, adversities, and false charges that he was aiding the Mexican army proved too much to bear. He fled to Mexico to &quot;seek refuge amongst my enemies,&quot; where he was captured, arrested and coerced to enlist in the Mexican army as a staff officer. He returned to San Antonio with the opposition army of [[Adrian Woll]]&lt;ref name=groneman99/&gt; in September 1842 and later served under Santa Anna in the [[Mexican-American War]] of 1846–1848.

==Later life==

In February 1848, Seguín requested permission to return to Texas. By the year's end, he had returned,&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja50&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; building a home&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/tx0234/|title=Juan N. Seguin Ranch House, Northwest of Floresville, Floresville, Wilson County, TX|first=historic american buildings|last=survey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1852; adjacent to his father [[Erasmo Seguín]]'s house, and ranching in [[Floresville, Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nofi8586&quot;/&gt; He was elected to two terms as [[Justice of the Peace]] of [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar County]] in 1852 and 1854, and became a founding father of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in Bexar county.&lt;ref name=&quot;de la Teja51&quot;&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, he published his life memoirs. Seguín served as [[County Judge]] in [[Wilson County, Texas|Wilson County]] in 1869. However, business dealings occasionally took him back to Mexico, and in around 1883 he settled in [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Tamaulipas]], Mexico, to be near his son Santiago, who was mayor. He died there on August 27, 1890. His remains were returned to Texas in 1974 and as part of the nation's Bicentennial celebration were reinterred in his namesake town, [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]],&lt;ref&gt;Groneman (1999), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; during ceremonies on July 4, 1976. A large monument, depicting him on horseback waving his saber, now honors his service to Texas, in the downtown Seguin Central Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visit Seguin, Texas&quot;&gt;[http://www.visitseguin.com/1747656_14849.htm Visit Seguin, Texas]&lt;/ref&gt;
