'''Gold''', commonly known as '''Gold Beach''', was the [[code name]] for one of the five areas of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German-occupied France]] in the [[Normandy landings]] on 6 June 1944, during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Gold, the central of the five areas, was located between [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain|Port-en-Bessin]] on the west and [[La Rivière-Saint-Sauveur|La Rivière]] on the east. High cliffs at the western end of the zone meant that the landings took place on the flat section between [[Asnelles|Le Hamel]] and La Rivière, in the sectors code-named Jig and King. Taking Gold was to be the responsibility of the [[British Army]], with sea transport, mine sweeping, and [[List of ships in Bombarding Force K|a naval bombardment force]] provided by the [[Royal Navy]] as well as elements from the [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Dutch]], [[Polish Navy|Polish]] and other Allied navies. 

The objectives at Gold were to secure a [[beachhead]], move west to capture [[Arromanches]] and establish contact with the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|American forces]] at [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]], capture [[Bayeux]] and the small port at Port-en-Bessin, and to link up with the [[3rd Canadian Division|Canadian forces]] at [[Juno Beach|Juno]] to the east. Forces attacking Gold faced elements of the [[352nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|German 352nd Infantry Division]] and [[716th Static Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|German 716th Infantry Division]]. About 2,000 men were stationed in the immediate area. Improvements to fortifications along the Normandy coast had been undertaken under the leadership of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]] beginning in October 1943.

On [[D-Day (military term)|D-Day]] at Gold, naval bombardment got underway at 05:30, and amphibious landings commenced at 07:25. High winds made conditions difficult for the landing craft, and the amphibious [[DD tank]]s were released close to shore or directly on the beach instead of further out as planned. Three of the four guns in a large emplacement at the [[Longues-sur-Mer battery]] were disabled by direct hits from the cruisers ''{{HMS|Ajax|22|2}}'' and ''{{HMS|Argonaut|61|2}}'' at 06:20. The fourth gun resumed firing intermittently in the afternoon, and its garrison surrendered on 7 June. Aerial attacks had failed to hit the Le Hamel strongpoint, which had its [[embrasure]] facing east to provide [[enfilade]] fire along the beach and had a thick concrete wall on the seaward side. Its 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun continued to do damage until 16:00, when a modified [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]] (AVRE) tank fired a large [[Petard#Variants|Petard bomb]] into its rear entrance. A second [[casemate]]d emplacement at La Rivière containing an 88&amp;nbsp;mm gun was neutralised by a tank at 07:30.

Meanwhile, infantry began clearing the heavily fortified houses along the shore and advanced on targets further inland. The [[British Commandos]] of [[No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando]] advanced on Port-en-Bessin and captured it on 7 June in the [[Battle of Port-en-Bessin]]. On the western flank, the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Hampshire Regiment|Hampshire Regiment]] captured Arromanches (future site of one of the artificial [[Mulberry harbour]]s), and [[69th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|69th Infantry Brigade]] on the eastern flank made contact with the Canadian forces at Juno. [[Company sergeant major|Company Sergeant Major]] [[Stanley Hollis]] received the only [[Victoria Cross]] awarded on D-Day for his actions while attacking two pillboxes at the Mont Fleury battery. Due to stiff resistance from the German 352nd Infantry Division, Bayeux was not captured until the next day. British casualties at Gold are estimated at 1,000–1,100. German casualties are unknown.

==Background==

===Operation Overlord===
{{Further|Invasion of Normandy|Operation Overlord}}
[[File:Allied Invasion Force.jpg|thumb|left|Allied invasion plans and German preparations in Normandy]]
After the Germans [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] began pressing for the creation of a [[Western Front (World War II)#1944–45: the second front|second front]] in Western Europe.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=9}} The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion of continental Europe within the next year was taken at the [[Trident Conference]], held in Washington in May 1943.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=11}} The Allies initially planned to launch the invasion on 1 May 1944, and a draft of the plan was accepted at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}}{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|p=491}} General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was appointed commander of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF).{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|p=491}} General [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] was named as commander of the [[21st Army Group]], which comprised all of the land forces involved in the invasion.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=12–13}}

On 31 December 1943, Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the plan, which proposed amphibious landings by three [[Division (military)|divisions]] and two-thirds of an airborne division.{{sfn|Balkoski|2005|p=5}} The two generals immediately insisted that the scale of the initial invasion be expanded to five divisions, with airborne descents by three divisions, to allow operations on a wider front.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}} The change doubled the frontage of the invasion from {{convert|25|mi}} to {{convert|50|mi}}. This would allow for quicker offloading of men and [[materiel]], make it more difficult for the Germans to respond, and speed up the capture of the port at [[Cherbourg]].{{sfn|Balkoski|2005|p=10}} The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft and troop carrier aircraft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June.{{sfn|Balkoski|2005|p=19}}

The Americans, assigned to land at [[Utah Beach|Utah]] and [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]], were to cut off the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] and capture the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at [[Sword Beach|Sword]] and Gold, and the Canadians at [[Juno Beach|Juno]], were to capture [[Caen]] and form a front line from [[Caumont-l'Éventé]] to the south-east of Caen to protect the American flank, while establishing airfields near Caen. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would provide a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the town of [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]]. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory north of the [[Avranches]]-Falaise line during the first three weeks. The Allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the [[River Seine]].{{sfn|Churchill|1951|pp=592–593}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|loc=Map, inside front cover}}{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=78, 81}} Montgomery envisaged a ninety-day battle, ending when all the forces reached the Seine.{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=698}}

===Allied planning===

Originally, seventeen sectors along the Normandy coastline had been selected as possible invasion sites and each were provided with a code name taken from one of the [[spelling alphabet]]s of the time. The coast was divided between Able, west of Omaha, to Rodger on the eastern flank of the invasion area. Eight further sectors were added when the planned invasion was extended to include Utah. Each sector was further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red, and White. Gold did not refer to a particular beach but to a landing area.{{sfn|Buckingham|2004|p=88}} It was delineated by [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain|Port-en-Bessin]] on the west and La Rivière on the east, and included [[Arromanches]], location of one of the artificial [[Mulberry harbour]]s that were to be constructed shortly after the invasion. High cliffs at the western end of the zone meant that the landings would be undertaken on the flat beach between Le Hamel and La Rivière, in the sectors code-named Jig and King.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=276}} The area immediately behind the beach was marshy, with open ground and [[bocage]] (small fields surrounded by hedges and embankments) further inland.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=92, 132}} Roads led to the south via [[Asnelles]] and [[Ver-sur-Mer]].{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=34}} The terrain to the south-east rose to a ridge at [[Meuvaines]], where on D-day were located machine gun nests of the German 726th Regiment.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=351–352}}

The [[Allied Expeditionary Air Force]] undertook over 3,200 photo reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 until the start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=81}} Members of [[Combined Operations Pilotage Parties]] clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including [[depth sounding]]s.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=21}} At Gold, frogmen discovered the shore between Asnelles and La Rivière was soft and could not support the weight of tanks. Twelve [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]] (AVREs) were fitted with [[Hobart's Funnies#Designs|bobbin]]s to overcome this problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface. The material would then be left in place to create a route for more conventional tanks.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=41}}{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=195}}

[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H38264.jpg|thumb|British troops wade ashore during [[Exercise Fabius]], 6 May 1944. ]]
Gold was assigned to the British [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]], with the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] –  commanded by Major General [[D.A.H. Graham]] – allotted as the assault division.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=271}} It was an experienced division that had already seen combat in France, North Africa, and Sicily.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=268}} The men underwent extensive training in amphibious landings, including [[Exercise Fabius]], a major training exercise at [[Hayling Island]] in May 1944.{{sfn|Yung|2006|p=153}} Demolition teams responsible for disabling underwater beach obstacles trained in swimming pools in the UK.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=41}} Briefings were undertaken using detailed maps that used fictitious place names, and most of the men did not find out their destination until they were already on their way to Normandy.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=30, 36}} The amphibious landing was to be preceded by extensive air bombardment as well as naval bombardment by [[List of ships in Bombarding Force K|Bombarding Force K]], a task force of eighteen ships, primarily cruisers and destroyers.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=49}} Amphibious tanks of the [[8th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Armoured Brigade]] were to arrive at 07:20, followed by infantry at 07:25.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=276–277}} The 231st Brigade was assigned to land at Jig, and 69th Brigade at King. The 231st was to head west to capture Arromanches and establish contact with the American forces at Omaha, while the 69th was to move east and link up with the Canadian forces at Juno.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=34–35}} The 47th Royal Marine Commando was assigned to land at Gold, infiltrate inland, and capture the small port at Port-en-Bessin from the landward side.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=276}}

Arriving in the second wave on Jig, [[56th Infantry Brigade]] was to capture [[Bayeux]] and a nearby ridge, thus cutting the N13 highway between Caen and Bayeux to make it difficult for the Germans to move in reinforcements. The second wave on King, [[151st Infantry Brigade]], was tasked with capturing the Caen road and railway, along with setting up positions on high ground between the [[Aure (river)|Aure]] and Seulles rivers.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=278}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=34, 38}} Other forces involved in the landing included artillery regiments, signals corps, and engineering units.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=38}}

===German defences===
[[File:Batterie-longues-sur-mer.jpg|thumb|A gun emplacement at Longues-sur-Mer battery, photographed in 2008]]
In late 1943, Hitler placed Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] in charge of improving the coastal defences along the [[Atlantic Wall]] in anticipation of an Allied invasion, expected to take place sometime in 1944.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=30}} Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=54}} In the immediate area of Gold, between Le Hamel and La Rivière, seven defensive strongpoints designed to hold 50 men apiece were constructed. Two major concrete-reinforced coastal artillery emplacements (a battery of four 122&amp;nbsp;mm guns at Mont Fleury and the [[Longues-sur-Mer battery]], with four 150&amp;nbsp;mm guns) were only partially completed by D-Day.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=22–23}} Rommel ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles to be placed on the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=55–56}} Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high tide mark.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=31}} Tangles of barbed wire, [[booby trap]]s, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=54–56}}

Hitler gave Rommel command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]], the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|15th Army]], and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Reserves for this group included the [[116th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd]], [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st]], and [[116th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|116th Panzer]] divisions.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|p=12}}{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=12}} Recognizing that Allied air superiority would make it difficult if not impossible to move reserves into position once the invasion was underway, Rommel decided to concentrate the defences along the coast.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=19}} The [[716th Static Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|716th Infantry Division]], which had been stationed in the area since March 1942, was significantly understrength, with only 6,000 men.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=14}} This unit received reinforcements, and some of the older men were replaced by younger soldiers. It was also supplemented by several battalions of ''[[Osttruppen]]'' (eastern soldiers), conscripted Soviet prisoners of war.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=14, 18}} The [[352nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|352nd Infantry Division]], a full-strength unit of around 12,000, was brought into the area by Rommel on 15 March and reinforced by two additional regiments.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=60, 63}} About 2,000 men, a mixture from the two infantry divisions, were stationed in the coastal area between Arromanches and Asnelles.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=29}}

From June 1942, 716th Infantry Division covered the Grandcamps Sector, which stretched from the base of the Cotentin Peninsula to the [[Orne (river)|Orne River]] near Caen, a distance of {{convert|77|km}}.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=60}} When 352nd Infantry Division arrived on 15 March, the Grandcamps Sector was split into the Bayeux Sector (from [[Carentan]] to Asnelles) and the Caen Sector (from Asnelles to the Orne). Most of the 716th Infantry Division remained where they were, and thus the defenses in Caen Sector (site of the Gold landings) were not substantially strengthened.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=20–21}}

==Landings==
[[File:Aerial Gold Beach.jpg|thumb|King Green and Jig beaches from the air during the 50th Division landings]]
Bombing of Normandy began around midnight with over 2,200 British and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=31}} At Gold, naval bombardment by Bombarding Force K got underway at 05:30, at which time the first waves of infantry were loading into their [[Landing Craft Assault]] (LCAs) for the run in to the beach.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=48–49}} German defensive positions were attacked by medium and heavy bombers and by [[self-propelled gun]]s on board the landing craft.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=79}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=50}} Results were good at Mont Fleury Battery and at Longues, where at 07:00 ''Ajax'' and ''Argonaut'' took out of commission three of the four guns. The fourth gun resumed firing sporadically in the afternoon, and the garrison surrendered the following day.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=299}} Two heavily casemated gun emplacements (an 88&amp;nbsp;mm gun at La Rivière overlooking King and a 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun at Le Hamel overlooking Jig) were only lightly damaged, as they were heavily reinforced with concrete, especially on the seaward side. These positions had embrasures that permitted a wide range of [[enfilade]] fire on the beach.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=286, 290}} Four other German strong points in the immediate area were also only lightly damaged, and had to be individually assaulted as the day progressed.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=51}}

===King Sector===
[[H-Hour]] for the landing at Gold was set at 07:25 on King sector (50 minutes later than in the American landings, because of differences in the tide).{{sfn|Holt|Holt|2009|p=129}} The first wave on King was the 5th East Yorkshires and 6th Green Howards of 69th Brigade, assisted by amphibious [[DD tank]]s of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=60}}{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=290}} The 7th Green Howards landed at 08:20.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=292}} The original plan called for the 38 DD tanks to be launched from their [[landing craft tank]] (LCTs) about {{convert|5000|yd}} out. Due to extremely choppy seas, they decided to run the tanks directly onto the beach.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=290}} Infantry, engineers, and DD tanks arrived almost simultaneously.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=60}} Units disembarking onto the beach immediately came under fire from the casemated 88&amp;nbsp;mm gun at La Rivière, and the infantry were forced to take cover behind the sea wall. The gun was taken out when a flail tank of the Westminster Dragoons fired a charge directly into its aperture.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=290–291}} The 5th East Yorkshires, supported by several tanks, spent the rest of the morning clearing out the heavily fortified houses of La Rivière, at the loss of 90 men, including six officers.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=291}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=64}}
[[File:D-day - British Forces during the Invasion of Normandy 6 June 1944 B5246.jpg|thumb|Commandos of 47 (RM) Commando coming ashore from LCAs (Landing Craft Assault)]]
Specialised armour arriving in the first wave included AVREs, [[mine flail]]s, and [[armoured bulldozer]]s.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=58}} Clearing paths off the beach proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone [[mine flail]] tank finally cleared a path from the beach up toward the Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=294}} This route was used by the Green Howards and tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, who cleared the remaining resistance at the Mont Fleury Battery. B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on [[Crépon]], where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=294–295}} Colour Sergeant-Major [[Stanley Hollis]] earned the only [[Victoria Cross]] to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox, so he shot into the entrance with his [[Sten|Sten gun]] and dropped a grenade through the roof, killing most of the occupants. He cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon the occupants of a second pillbox surrendered.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=302}} Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near Crépon.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=128–131}}

Scheduled to land at 11:00 on Jig, the 56th Infantry Brigade was re-routed King, because the gun battery at Le Hamel was still operational. They proceeded towards their objective of Bayeux.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=295}} 151st Brigade arrived at the same time and after meeting fierce resistance, they achieved their objective of controlling the road and railway between Bayeux and Caen.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=295, 301}} 56th Brigade made slow progress and had to dig in for the night some distance from Bayeux.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=300–301}} 69th Brigade secured the eastern flank and by nightfall made contact with the Canadian forces on Juno.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=300–301}}

===Jig Sector===
[[File:D-day - British Forces during the Invasion of Normandy 6 June 1944 B5252.jpg|thumb|German strong point WN-35 at Le Pont Chaussé, on the boundary between Jig and King. Heavily damaged by offshore bombardment, it was captured by the 6th Howards with support from three AVRE tanks of 81st Assault Squadron.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=115, 121–122, 185}}]]
At Jig, the first wave of infantry (the 1st Dorsetshires and 1st Hampshires of the 231st Infantry Brigade) arrived at 07:25, and immediately came under fire from the casemated 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun at Le Hamel. Due to navigation errors and the strong current, both groups came ashore well to the east of their intended landing points. The DD tank and Royal Marine [[Cromwell tank|Centaur tanks]] that were supposed to arrive in advance of the landing were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until 08:00. Many of the tanks got bogged down on the beach or were taken out by enemy fire.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=51–52, 55}} The tide came in quicker than expected, before many of the beach obstacles and mines were cleared, and some of the landing craft were damaged as a result.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=56}}
Two companies of the 1st Hampshires landed very close to the strong point at Le Hamel, and had to fight inland through enemy garrisons to get off the beach.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=286}} Attempts to flank Le Hamel were made difficult by the surrounding machine gun placements, mines, and barbed wire.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=286}} Elements of the 1st Hampshires captured the German strongpoint WN-36 at the eastern edge of the village of Asnelles.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=137}} When they turned west to move along the beach towards their primary objective at Le Hamel, they came under heavy fire and had to break off the attack.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=55}} Major Warren, in charge after the commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Nelson Smith was wounded, decided that the troops would have to circle around and attack the emplacement from the rear, a process that took several hours.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=287}} The troops began to have some success around 15:00 with the arrival of an AVRE tank of 82nd Assault Squadron. The tank fired two [[petard]]s into the sanatorium, where most of the defenders were located.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=145}} The German soldiers fled into fortified houses in Le Hamel and Asnelles, and were taken out in house-to-house combat. Few surrendered. The 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun was finally silenced at 16:00, when the AVRE tank fired a large petard charge into the rear entrance of the casemate.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=298–299}} C/A Company, 1st Hampshires and the AVRE tank proceeded west along the beach and took out strongpoint WN-38 at La Fontaine St Côme, taking 20 prisoners. Still further west, D Company captured strong point WN-39 at the Arromanches radar station, capturing 30 more defenders.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=146–147}}

The 2nd Devons arrived at 08:15, while the beach was still under heavy fire. One company stayed to help with the assault on Le Hamel, while the rest moved to capture the village of Ryes astride the road to Bayeux.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=289}} Ryes was captured at around 16:30.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=78}} The 1st Dorsets attacked a German position on the beach at La Cabane des Douanes and headed inland to arc westward toward the high ground south of Arromanches.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=282}} They cleared enemy positions at Le Bulot and Puits d'Hérode, and arrived at their destination late in the morning.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=289}} Joined by elements of the 1st Hampshires and covered by [[indirect fire]] from the naval forces offshore, they took Arromanches late in the afternoon.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=299}}

===47th Commando===
{{Main|Battle of Port-en-Bessin}}
The 47th Royal Marine Commando was assigned to capture the small harbour at [[Port-en-Bessin]], on the boundary with Omaha, about {{convert|7|mi}} west of Arromanches and {{convert|8|mi}} from their landing point at Jig. The commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel C. F. Phillips, opted to attack from the south, as the site was well protected on the seaward side. The force of 420 men consisted of five troops of 63 men, a mortar and machine gun troop, a transport group with four tracked vehicles, and a headquarters group. The plan was to land at Gold at 09:25, assemble at La Rosière, and move cross-country to a ridge (designated as Point 72) south of Port-en-Bessin, arriving at around 13:00. Here they would call for indirect fire from the supporting vessels at sea and then move in to capture the town.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=152–153}}

In rough seas and under enemy fire, the commandos began disembarking at Jig, some distance east of their intended position, at 09:50. Five of their LCAs were sunk by beach obstacles or enemy fire, at the cost of 76 casualties. Major P. M. Donnell temporarily took charge until Phillips and some others who had got separated from the unit rejoined the group at 14:00 along the Meuvaines–Le Carrefour road. The commando took additional casualties in several skirmishes, including at La Rosière, on the way to Point 72. They did not arrive there until 22:30, too late to launch an attack, so they dug in for the night. The town and port were captured in the [[battle of Port-en-Bessin]] on 7–8 June 1944.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=154}}{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=289}}

===German response===
[[File:The Second British Army on D-Day.jpg|thumb|Map shows the British and Canadian beaches, and the positions at the close of D-Day.]]
As the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' meteorological centre in Paris had predicted two weeks of stormy weather, some Wehrmacht commanders were away from the front attending [[Military simulation|war games]] in [[Rennes]], and many soldiers had been given leave.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=131}} On D-Day, Rommel was in Germany for his wife's birthday and a meeting with Hitler to try to get more [[Panzer]]s.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=42–43}} The 352nd and 716th Divisions were placed on high alert after the Allied airborne landings, which had taken just after midnight behind Utah and Sword.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=67}} The 2,700-strong ''Kampfgruppe Meyer'', near Bayeux as the divisional reserve, was sent to investigate the parachute drops behind Utah. Marcks recalled them when dawn broke and the scope of the invasion became apparent.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=86}} One battalion was ordered to reinforce the German efforts at Omaha. The remainder were ordered to rendezvous with reinforcements at Villiers le Sec, {{convert|7.5|mi}} east of Bayeux, to launch a counter-attack. Fired upon by Allied air forces, the column finally arrived in the late afternoon, at which time they were met by elements of the 69th Brigade. The British lost four tanks in the ensuing engagement but the ''Kampfgruppe'' was almost completely wiped out. Meyer was killed, and his detailed maps of German coastal emplacements fell into British hands.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=303–305}}

Because Allied air superiority meant it would be difficult for the Germans to move up their reserves, Rommel believed that their best chance was to stop the invasion at the shore.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=31}} The scope of the invasion meant that once these coastal defences were defeated and the troops scattered, it was difficult to defend territory inland or launch counter-attacks.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=303}} At 22:33, Kraiss ordered the 352nd Division to create a defensive line north of Bayeux but this proved impossible, as most of the territory involved was already in British hands and all the defending units had taken serious losses.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=84}} The ''Luftwaffe'' played only a minor role on D-Day. At Gold, several small groups of bombers that arrived at sunset caused Allied casualties at Le Hamel and damaged a road near Ver-sur-Mer. At 06:00 on 7 June, the operations room of {{HMS|Bulolo||6}}, offshore near Gold, was damaged by a bomber attack, but the ship was able to remain on station.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=85–86}} The unit responsible was likely II./''[[Kampfgeschwader 40]]'' (KG 40—Bomber Wing 40). Under the command of ''[[Fliegerführer Atlantik]]'' (Flyer Command Atlantic), it was based at [[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport|Bordeaux–Merignac]]. On the evening of the 6/7 June 1944, 26 [[Heinkel He 177]] heavy bombers equipped with [[Henschel Hs 293]] anti-ship [[guided missile]]s attacked shipping over Normandy, included the Gold area. II./KG 40 lost 13 aircraft to all causes during the attack.{{sfn|de Zeng|2007|p=133}}

The ''[[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]]'' were released before midnight from the [[OKW]] reserve and ordered to counter-attack between Bayeux and the [[Orne (river)|Orne]], supplemented by ''[[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]]'' and ''[[Panzer Lehr Division]]''; the armoured divisions began arriving on 8 June.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=84–85}}

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
Pockets of German resistance remained throughout the beachhead area and the British were stopped about {{convert|3.7|mi}} short of their D-Day objectives.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=83}} Bayeux, a primary D-Day objective for 50th Division, was captured on 7 June.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=175}} By the end of D-Day, the 50th Division had lost around 700 men. Total casualties, from all units involved in operations at Gold, were in the region of 1,000–1,100 casualties, of which 350 were killed.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=83, 84}} German losses are unknown; at least 1,000 were captured.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=83}}

===Gold Beach after 6 June===
{{see also|Battle of Port-en-Bessin}}

[[File:Moving towards inland from Gold Beach.jpg|thumb|[[Cromwell tank|Cromwell]] and [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] tanks of the 7th Armoured Division, moving inland, 7 June ]]
By the end of D-Day, 24,970 men had been landed at Gold Beach, along with 2,100 vehicles and {{convert|1000|LT|MT}} of supplies.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=84}}{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|p=223}} The follow-up landings were slowed by the loss of 34 LCTs and the bad weather. The [[24th Lancers]] and 61st [[Reconnaissance Corps|Reconnaissance Regiment]], due to land on D-Day to help spearhead the drive towards [[Villers-Bocage, Calvados|Villers-Bocage]], were unable to put ashore until 7 June. In 2004 Trew wrote that the delay

{{quotation|effectively ruled out any chance of a thrust south ... [and] ... represented a major blow to Second Army's intentions and Montgomery's plan.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=83–84}}{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|p=230}}}}

The [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] and the [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]] were the follow-up divisions of XXX Corps.{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|p=79}} The [[22nd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|22nd Armoured Brigade]] (the armoured component of the 7th Armoured Division) was scheduled to land during the evening of 6 June, but it was unable to land until the next day.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=84}} The bulk of the division landed from 9–10 June, with some elements landing later.{{sfn|Marie|2004|p=50}}{{sfn|Taylor|1999|p=84}} The 49th Division came ashore on 12 June.{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|p=79}}{{sfn|Chappell|1987|p=33}}

The first components of the Mulberry harbours were brought across the Channel on D+1 and the structures were in use for unloading by mid-June.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=321}} One was constructed at Arromanches by British forces, the other at Omaha by American forces. A severe storm on 19 June destroyed the Omaha harbour.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=215–216}} The Arromanches harbour was repaired and remained in use for the next ten months, with a maximum capacity of {{convert|7000|LT|MT}} of stores per day. Of the British supplies landed in Normandy by the end of August, {{nowrap|35% arrived}} via the Mulberry harbour and {{nowrap|15% came}} in via the small harbours at Port-en-Bessin and [[Courseulles-sur-Mer]]. Most shipments were brought in over the beaches until the port of Cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on 16 July.{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|p=479}}{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=387}}{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=331}} The most important use of the Mulberry harbour was the unloading of heavy machinery that could not be brought across the beaches. Artificial breakwaters (Gooseberries) sheltered hundreds of ships during the storm of 17–23 June, and provided shelter for craft unloading stores at Juno and Sword.{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=479–480}} A joint Anglo-American [[oil depot]] was constructed at Port-en-Bessin, fed via buoyed pipes known as &quot;Tombola&quot; from oil tankers moored offshore. Using this method, {{convert|175000|LT|MT}} of petrol (half for the Second Army) was delivered by the end of August, by which time the underwater pipelines constructed in [[Operation Pluto]] were ready.{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=302, 479}}

===Subsequent operations===
{{see also|Battle for Caen}}

[[File:Battleforceanmapenglish.PNG|thumb|Operations in the [[Battle for Caen]] ]]
Fighting in the Caen area versus the 21st Panzer, the 12th SS Panzer Division ''Hitlerjugend'', and other units soon reached a stalemate.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=186}} [[Operation Perch]] (7–14 June) failed to take Caen, and the British were forced to withdraw to [[Tilly-sur-Seulles]].{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=247–254}} After a delay because of storms during 17–23 June, [[Operation Epsom]] was launched on 26 June, an attempt by [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII Corps]] to swing around and attack Caen from the south-west and establish a bridgehead south of the [[Odon (river)|Odon]].{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=342}} Although the operation failed to take Caen, the Germans suffered heavy tank losses and had committed every available Panzer unit to the operation.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=232–237}} Caen was severely bombed on the night of 7 July and then occupied north of the River Orne in [[Operation Charnwood]] on 8–9 July.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=273}} Two offensives during 18–21 July, [[Operation Atlantic]] and [[Operation Goodwood]], captured the rest of Caen and the high ground to the south, but by then the city was nearly destroyed.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=340–341}}

==Tourism==
The site of the Normandy landings is a popular tourist destination.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=345}} The battery at Longues-sur-Mer is well preserved, and its observation bunker houses a visitor centre. The gun emplacements at Le Hamel and La Rivière still exist, but many other batteries and defensive positions have been allowed to decay. Bayeux is home to the ''Musée Mémorial de la Bataille de Normandie'' and the [[Bayeux Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery]]. [[La Cambe German war cemetery]] is also near Bayeux. At Arromanches, many elements of the Mulberry Harbour are extant and a museum examines its construction and use. The radar station is the site of a visitor centre and theatre.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=109–110}}{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=352}}
