{{Yemeni Crisis (2011–present)}}

The '''Yemeni Civil War''' is an ongoing conflict that began in 2015 between two factions claiming to constitute the [[Yemen]]i government, along with their supporters and allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/143295/asher-orkaby/houthi-who|agency=Foreign Affairs|title=Houthi Who?|first=Asher|last=Orkaby|date=25 March 2015|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Houthis|Houthi]] forces controlling the capital [[Sana'a]] and allied with forces loyal to the former president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] have clashed with forces loyal to the government of [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]], based in [[Aden]].

== Background ==
{{main article|Houthi insurgency in Yemen|Houthi takeover in Yemen|Aftermath of the Houthi takeover in Yemen}}
Ansar Allah (sometimes Anglicised as Ansarullah), known popularly as the [[Houthis]], a [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] group with its origins in the mountainous [[Sa'dah Governorate]] on Yemen's northern border with [[Saudi Arabia]], began waging a low-level [[Houthi insurgency in Yemen|insurgency]] against the [[government of Yemen|Yemeni government]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3643600.stm|agency=BBC News|title=Yemeni forces kill rebel cleric|date=10 September 2004|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of the conflict waxed and waned over the course of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], with multiple peace agreements being negotiated and later disregarded.

On 21 February, one month after Houthi militants confined Hadi to his residence in Sana'a, he slipped out of the capital and traveled to [[Aden]].

===Allegations of outside support===
The Houthis have long been accused of being proxies for [[Iran]], since they both follow [[Shia Islam]].  (Although the Iranians are Twelve-Imam Shias and the Houthis are [[Zaidis|Five-Imam Shias]].)  The [[United States]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] have alleged that the Houthis receive weapons and training from Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;warns&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32229316|agency=BBC News|title=Yemen crisis: Kerry warns Iran over Houthi rebel 'support'|date=9 April 2015|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Houthis and Iranian government have denied any affiliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;crucial&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/15/us-yemen-houthis-iran-insight-idUSKBN0JT17A20141215|agency=Reuters|title=Iranian support seen  crucial for Yemen's Houthis|date=15 December 2014|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Africa]]n nation of [[Eritrea]] has also been accused of funneling Iranian material to the Houthis,&lt;ref name=&quot;tjotw&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/182683/eritrea-denies-channeling-iranian-support-to-houthis.html|agency=The Journal of Turkish Weekly|title=Eritrea denies channeling Iranian support to Houthis|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as offering medical care for injured Houthi fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;alarm&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/haber/152737/houthi-rise-in-yemen-raises-alarm-in-horn-of-africa|date=12 January 2015|accessdate=9 April 2015|title=Houthi rise in Yemen raises alarm in Horn of Africa|agency=World Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eritrean government has called the allegations &quot;groundless&quot; and said after the outbreak of open hostilities that it views the Yemeni crisis &quot;as an internal matter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tjotw&quot;/&gt; Documents from wikileaks suggest that privately US officials believe that allegations of Iranian support for the Houthis have been overstated by the Yemeni Government for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANAA1662_a.html|title=Cable: 09SANAA1662_a|work=wikileaks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yemeni government, meanwhile, has enjoyed significant international backing from the United States and Persian Gulf monarchies. U.S. drone strikes were conducted regularly in Yemen during Hadi's presidency in [[Sana'a]], usually targeting [[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/6/al-qaeda-on-rise-despite-us-support-to-yemen/|agency=The Washington Times|title=Al Qaeda on rise despite U.S. support to Yemen|first=Kristina|last=Wong|date=6 August 2013|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States was also a major supplier of weapons to the Yemeni government, although according to the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], hundreds of millions of [[United States dollar|dollars]]' worth of that material has gone missing since it was delivered.&lt;ref name=&quot;loses&quot;/&gt; Saudi Arabia provided financial aid to Yemen until late 2014, when it suspended it amid the Houthis' [[Battle of Sana'a (2014)|takeover of Sana'a]] and increasing influence over the Yemeni government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/04/us-yemen-saudi-aid-idUSKCN0JI10V20141204|agency=Reuters|title=Exclusive: Saudi suspends aid to Yemen after Houthi takeover – sources|date=12 December 2014|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troops loyal to Hadi clashed with those who refused to recognise his authority in a [[Battle of Aden Airport|battle]] for [[Aden International Airport]] on 19 March 2015.

After the [[2015 Sana'a mosque bombings]] on 20 March 2015, in a televised speech, [[Abdul-Malik al-Houthi]], the leader of the Houthis, said his group's decision to mobilize for war was &quot;imperative&quot; under current circumstances and that [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] and its affiliates—among whom he counts Hadi—would be targeted, as opposed to southern Yemen and its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1870/news/4994/Southerners-prepare-for-Houthi-invasion.htm|title=SOUTHERNERS PREPARE FOR HOUTHI INVASION|first=Khalid|last=Al-Karimi|date=23 March 2015|accessdate=25 March 2015|agency=Yemen Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Hadi declared Aden to be Yemen's temporary capital while [[Sana'a]] remained under Houthi control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-beleaguered-hadi-says-aden-yemen-capital-2015-3|agency=Business Insider|title=Beleaguered Hadi says Aden Yemen 'capital'|date=7 March 2015|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tejas |first=Aditya|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/yemeni-president-abed-rabbo-mansour-hadi-flees-aden-houthis-advance-1858514|title=Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi Flees Aden As Houthis Advance|date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following evening, Saudi Arabia began a military intervention alongside eight other [[Arab world|Arab states]] and with the logistical support of the [[United States]] against the Houthis, bombing positions throughout Sana'a.

====Drone strikes====
{{See also|Terrorism in Yemen#US air attacks|List of drone strikes in Yemen}}
Since the mid-2000s, the [[United States]] has been carrying out targeted killings of [[jihad]]ist militants and ideologues in [[Yemen]], although the U.S. government generally does not confirm involvement in specific attacks conducted by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s as a matter of policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-silence-on-drone-strikes-comes-under-pressure-after-hostage-deaths/2015/04/24/cb48e9d4-eaa7-11e4-aae1-d642717d8afa_story.html|agency=The Washington Post|title=U.S. government’s refusal to discuss drone attacks comes under fire|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the civil war in Yemen, drone strikes have continued, targeting wanted leaders of [[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]]. [[Ibrahim al-Rubeish]] and [[Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi]], two leading AQAP figures, were killed by U.S. drone strikes in the vicinity of [[Al Mukalla]] in May.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/world/middleeast/us-drone-kills-a-top-figure-in-al-qaedas-yemen-branch.html?_r=1|agency=The New York Times|title=U.S. Drone Kills a Top Figure in Al Qaeda's Yemen Branch|date=14 April 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015|first=Scott|last=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/07/yemen-al-qaida-droke-strike-charlie-hebdo|agency=The Guardian|title=Al-Qaida in Yemen says US drone killed man who claimed Charlie Hebdo attack|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 240 AQAP militants have been killed by American drone strikes since the civil war began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longwarjournal.org/multimedia/Yemen/code/Yemen-strike.php &quot;Long War Journal: Yemen&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic State has proclaimed several provinces in Yemen and has urged its adherents to wage war against the Houthi movement, as well as against Zaydis in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ISIS%20INTSUM_Final.pdf|agency=Institute for the Study of War|title=ISIS Global Intelligence Summary March 1 - May 7|date=10 May 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIS militants have conducted bombing attacks in various parts of the country, particularly against mosques in Sana'a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31989844|agency=BBC|title=Yemen crisis: Islamic State claims Sanaa mosque attacks|date=21 March 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/06/us-yemen-security-blast-idUSKCN0S02CV20151006|agency=Reuters|title=Seven killed in Islamic State suicide bombing in Yemeni capital|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 2015, IS militants conducted a series of suicide bombings in Aden that killed 15 soldiers affiliated with the Hadi government and the Saudi-led coalition.&lt;ref name=&quot;reutersoct6&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/06/us-yemen-security-aden-hotel-idUSKCN0S009E20151006|agency=Reuters|title=Islamic State claims suicide attacks on Yemeni government, Gulf troops|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attacks were directed against the al-Qasr hotel, which had been a headquarters for pro-Hadi officials, and also military facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;reutersoct6&quot;/&gt;  Prior to the claim of responsibility by the Islamic State, officials from the UAE attributed the damage to rockets fired by forces loyal to the Houthis and Ali Abdullah Saleh.&lt;ref name=&quot;reutersoct6&quot;/&gt;

===May 2015 truce===
{{main article|Yemeni crisis reconciliation attempts}}
A five-day ceasefire proposed by Saudi Arabia was accepted by the Houthis and their allies in the military on 10 May 2015. The ceasefire was intended to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yemens-houthi-rebels-accept-five-day-truce-proposal-1431250255|agency=The Wall Street Journal|title=Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Accept Five-Day Truce Proposal|date=10 May 2015|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporary truce began on the night of 12 May to allow the delivery of food, water, medical, and fuel aid throughout the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;trucetakes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32719194|agency=BBC News|title=Yemen conflict: Aid effort begins as truce takes hold|date=13 May 2015|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fourth day of the truce, the fragile peace unraveled as fighting broke out in multiple southern governorates. At least three civilians in [[Aden]] and 12 in [[Taiz]] were killed on 16 May, despite the ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/fighting-rages-yemen-4th-day-humanitarian-truce-31092753|agency=ABC News|title=Fighting Rages in Yemen on 4th Day of Humanitarian Truce|first=Ahmed|last=Al-Haj|date=16 May 2015|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agence France-Presse]] reported that &quot;dozens&quot; were killed in southern Yemen by the clashes, including 26 Houthi and 12 pro-Hadi fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20150516-south-yemen-clashes-kill-dozens-ceasefire-nears-end |agency=France 24 |title=South Yemen clashes kill dozens as ceasefire nears end |date=16 May 2015 |accessdate=16 May 2015 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Omani Initiative====
Around this same time reports surfaced in the media suggesting that [[Oman]], which is the only Middle Eastern Monarchy not taking part in the coalition and has a border with Yemen, has presented a 7-point plan to both Iran and Saudi Arabia. Oman has played a vital role as a bridge between Tehran and the West in the past to help in the nuclear negotiations and thus enjoys good relations with Iran as well as its GCC neighbors. It has also been suggested that Oman was responsible to mediate a 24-hour ceasefire although analysts doubt if Oman can help bring about more rigid negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/05/oman-response-yemen-conflict.html#| title=Oman breaks from GCC on Yemen conflict|work=Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East| accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2015/4/24/oman-offers-seven-point-peace-plan-for-yemen|title=Oman offers seven-point peace plan for Yemen|author=Al-Araal-Jadeed staff|work=alaraby|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following parts constituted the planned initiative:
* The withdrawal of the Houthis and forces loyal to deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh from all Yemeni cities and the return of military hardware and munitions seized from the Yemeni Army.
* The restoration of the president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi and the government of Khalid Bahah.
* Early parliamentary and presidential elections.
* An agreement signed by all Yemeni parties.
* The conversion of [[Houthis|Ansarullah]] into a political party.
* An international aid conference attended by donor states.
* Yemen entering the Gulf Cooperation Council.

The [[United Nations]] announced on 19 April that [[Saudi Arabia]] promised to provide $273.7 million in emergency humanitarian aid to Yemen. The UN appealed for the aid, saying 7.5 million people had been affected by the conflict and many were in need of medical supplies, potable water, food, shelter, and other forms of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/04/19/fighting-airstrikes-hit-across-yemen-as-saudi-arabia-pledges-aid/|agency=Fox News|title=Fighting, airstrikes hit across Yemen as Saudi Arabia pledges aid|date=19 April 2015|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May, [[Oxfam]] warned that the five days a humanitarian ceasefire was scheduled to last would not be sufficient to fully address Yemen's humanitarian crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;trucetakes&quot;/&gt;

It has also been said that the Houthis are collecting a war tax on goods.

According to [[Farea Al-Muslim]], direct war crimes have been committed during the conflict; for example, an [[Internally displaced person|IDP]] camp was hit by a Saudi airstrike, while Houthis have sometimes prevented aid workers from giving aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kasinof|first=Laura|title=How Yemen’s Civil Conflict Turned Into a Regional Proxy War |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/206161/how-yemens-civil-conflict-turned-regional-proxy-war|work=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UN]] and several major human rights groups discussed the possibility that war crimes may have been committed by Saudi Arabia during the air campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Watch: Saudi-Led Coalition Bombing Yemen with Banned U.S.-Made Cluster Munitions|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2015/5/5/human_rights_watch_saudi_led_coalition|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, Johannes van der Klaauw, said that air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition on Sa’ada city in Yemen, where many civilians were trapped, were in breach of [[international humanitarian law]], despite calls for civilians to leave the area.

A group of 17 aid agencies working in Yemen condemned the growing intensity of airstrikes in the north of Yemen on 8 and 9 May 2015.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has claimed that [[Houthis|Houthi militias]] in alliance with the militants of exiled former president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] killed purposely at least 22 civilians in [[Taiz]]. According to eyewitnesses, the militants launched [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rockets]] targeting the markets and residential neighbourhoods in the center of Taiz. As a result, many civilians were killed and wounded. On the other hand, local media belonging to Houthi militias have denied such accusation, accusing [[Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] for committing these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.euromedmonitor.org/en/article/982/Humanitarian-catastrophe-is-imminent-in-Yemeni-city-of-Taiz-as-Houthis-target-civilians|title = Humanitarian catastrophe is imminent in yemeni city of taiz as houthis target civilians|website = Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, HRW claimed that six &quot;unlawful airstrikes&quot; were carried out in the capital by the Saudi-led coalition in September and October, which killed 60 civilians.

Iranian foreign minister [[Mohammad Javad Zarif]] submitted four-point Yemen peace plan to United Nations.
