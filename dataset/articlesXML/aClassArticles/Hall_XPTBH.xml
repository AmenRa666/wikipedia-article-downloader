The '''Hall XPTBH''' was a prototype [[United States|American]] twin-engined [[floatplane|seaplane]], submitted to the [[United States Navy]] by the [[Hall Aluminum Aircraft Corporation]] in response to a 1934 specification for new bomber and scout aircraft. Constructed in an innovative fashion that made extensive use of [[aluminum]], the XPTBH proved successful in flight testing, but failed to win favor with the U.S. Navy. No production contract was awarded, and the single aircraft built served in experimental duties before its destruction in a [[hurricane]] during 1938.

==Design and development==
In late 1934, the U.S. Navy's [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] (BuAer) issued a specification for new [[scout bomber]] and [[torpedo bomber]] designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bipe&quot;&gt;Dann 1996, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight companies submitted a total of ten designs in response, evenly split between [[monoplane]]s and [[biplane]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vind&quot;&gt;Doll 1992, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| The designs submitted, in total, were the [[Brewster SBA]], [[Curtiss SBC Helldiver|Curtiss SBC]], [[Douglas TBD Devastator|Douglas TBD]], [[Great Lakes XB2G]], [[Great Lakes XTBG]], [[Grumman XSBF]], Hall XPTBH, [[Northrop BT]] (which became the [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|SBD Dauntless]]), [[Vought SB2U Vindicator|Vought SB2U]] and [[Vought XSB3U]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Vind&quot;/&gt; the XTBD and XTBG were the XPTBH's main competitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pro&quot;/&gt;|group=N}} The Hall Aluminum Aircraft Company submitted the only seaplane design;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vind&quot;/&gt; a single prototype was ordered by the Navy for evaluation on June 30, 1934. Given the designation XPTBH-1,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg&quot;/&gt; it became the only aircraft to receive three mission-type letters under the [[1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system|U.S. Navy's designation system]] used between 1922 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Swanborough and Bowers 1990, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly and Riley 1997, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings1&quot;&gt;Boyne 2001, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall's choice of the twin-float seaplane configuration was dictated by the Navy's requirement that the new torpedo-bomber design should be capable of carrying a standard naval [[torpedo]] of the type carried by [[destroyer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; As ordered, the XPTBH-1 was intended to be fitted with [[Wright R-1820]] &quot;Cyclone&quot; [[radial engine]]s;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg&quot;/&gt; delays in design caused by Hall relocating their production facility, difficulties with the contract, and doubts about the aircraft's performance potential led to a redesign, the aircraft becoming slightly smaller and the engines being changed to a pair of [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830]] &quot;Twin Wasp&quot; radials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trim&quot;&gt;Trimble 2005, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The changes to the aircraft resulted in it receiving the revised designation XPTBH-2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt;

Utilising Hall's standard aluminum [[tubular spar]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; the fuselage and wing leading edges were covered in aluminum, while the rest of the wing and the control surfaces were fabric-covered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; The aircraft was well-armed defensively by 1930s standards, with a powered turret, designed by Hall, mounted in the nose and carrying a single .30-caliber [[machine gun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; [[Weapon mount#Pintle|Hand-traversed mountings]] for a pair of machine guns were fitted in dorsal (top) and ventral (belly) positions aft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; An [[optically flat]] glass panel was fitted in the nose below the turret for use by the [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; the aircraft's offensive weaponry, consisting of a [[Mark 13 torpedo|Mark XIII]] [[aerial torpedo]] or, alternatively, up to {{convert|2000|lb}} of bombs,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; was carried in an internal [[bomb bay]], the twin-float arrangement allowing for a clear release of the weaponry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg&quot;/&gt;

==Operational history==
Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1960, p.335.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| A Navy source gives December 17, 1936 as the acceptance date.&lt;ref&gt;Van Fleet et al. 1985, p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} the aircraft was officially presented to the public at Hall's [[Bristol, Pennsylvania]] factory in April of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February&lt;ref name=&quot;Trim&quot;/&gt; and conducted by test pilot [[Bill McAvoy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the only significant issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the [[aileron]]s to turn the aircraft – as a result of the surface area of the floats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; A modification to increase the area of the rudder solved the issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings3&quot;&gt;Boyne 2001, p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; the only significant complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's [[beaching gear]], which was found to be extremely difficult to use in anything other than the calmest water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings3&quot;/&gt;

Although the XPTBH-2 met most of its design specifications and was rated overall very good in flight testing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings3&quot;/&gt; it failed to meet the contractual requirements for top speed and attack speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trim&quot;/&gt; In addition, the U.S. Navy did not consider a seagoing torpedo-bomber to be an aircraft for which there was an operational requirement;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;/&gt; the fact that as a floatplane the aircraft was restricted to operation from water was also considered a negative,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pro&quot;&gt;Windrow 1970, pp.28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; while the aircraft's &quot;three-in-one&quot; role led it to be viewed as a [[Jack of all trades, master of none|jack of all trades]], purpose-designed aircraft for each role being considered superior.&lt;ref&gt;Trimble 1982, p.207.&lt;/ref&gt; The company, however, blamed Navy politics for the lack of a production order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings3&quot;/&gt;

Following the conclusion of its test program, the XPTBH-2 was used for experimental duties at the [[Naval Torpedo Station]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], participating in trials of aerial torpedoes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trim&quot;/&gt; Its service at Newport came to an end on September 21, 1938, when the XPTBH-2 was destroyed during the [[Great New England Hurricane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings3&quot;/&gt; The XPTBH-2 was the last aircraft designed by Hall Aluminum;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wings2&quot;&gt;Boyne 2001, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; the company remained in business until 1940, when it was bought out by [[Consolidated Aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Pattillo 2000, p.105.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Deliveries of the [[Hall PH]], a biplane flying boat which first flew in 1929, continued until 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Wegg 1990, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}
