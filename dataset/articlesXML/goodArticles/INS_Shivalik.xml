'''INS ''Shivalik'' (F47)''' is the lead ship of [[Shivalik-class frigate|her class]] of [[Stealth ship|stealth]] multi-role [[frigate]]s built for the [[Indian Navy]]. She is the first stealth warship built by India.&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/may/10nad.htm |title=Riding the waves |publisher=Rediff.com |date=10 May 2003 |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was built at the [[Mazagon Dock Limited]] (MDL) located in [[Mumbai]]. Construction of the vessel began in 2001 and was completed by 2009. She underwent sea trials from thereon before being commissioned on 29 April 2010.&lt;ref name=dh-induct&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/66599/india-commissions-its-first-stealth.html India commissions its first stealth warship, joins elite club]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/apr/21/slide-show-1-why-shivalik-class-frigates-matter-to-india.htm Why Shivalik-class frigates matter to India ]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shivalik'' features improved stealth and land attacking features over the preceding {{sclass|Talwar|frigate}}s. She is also the first Indian navy ship to use the [[CODOG]] (COmbined Diesel Or Gas) propulsion system.&lt;ref name=&quot;naval-technology1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/shivalik-class-friga/ |title=Shivalik Class Frigates |publisher=Naval Technology |date=15 June 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and description==
The ''Shivalik''-class frigates were conceived as part of the [[Indian Navy]]'s ''Project 17'', which set down the requirements for a class of stealthy frigates to be designed and built in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD 2004&quot;&gt;[http://mod.nic.in/reports/MOD-English2004.pdf 2003-04 Annual Report of the Ministry of Defence], India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD activities&quot;&gt;[http://mod.nic.in/reports/achievements/majoractivities.doc MoD - Report on Major Activities, 2002-05 (doc)], [[Ministry of Defence (India)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Directorate of Naval Design (DND)'s design specifications for the ''Shivalik'' class called for &quot;5000 ton stealth frigates (Project 17) incorporating advanced signature suppression and signature management features&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naval Constructors&quot;&gt;[http://mod.nic.in/samachar/dec1-06/h4.htm The Corps of Naval Constructors - Building Self Reliance], MoD Samachar, [[Ministry of Defence (India)]], 1 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The first three units were formally ordered by the Indian Navy in early 1999.&lt;ref name=BR-Shivalik&gt;{{cite web|title=Project 17 (Shivalik) Class|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Ships/Active/190-Project-17.html|work=Surface Fleet, Active Ships, Project 17 (Shivalik) Class|publisher=[[Bharat Rakshak|Bharat-rakshak.com]]|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General characteristics and propulsion ===
INS ''Shivalik'' has a length of {{cvt|142.5|m}} [[Length overall|overall]], a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|16.9|m}} and a [[Draft (ship)|draft]] of {{cvt|4.5|m}}.

*1 ×  MR-760 Fregat M2EM 3-D radar
*4 ×  MR-90 Orekh radars
*1 × [[Elta]] [[EL/M-2238 STAR]]
*2 ×  Elta EL/M-2221 STGR
*1 ×[[Bharat Electronics Limited|BEL]] APARNA
In addition, it uses HUMSA (hull-mounted sonar array), ATAS/Thales Sintra towed array systems and the BEL Ajanta [[Electronic Warfare]] suite.&lt;ref name=&quot;naval-technology1&quot;/&gt;

=== Armament ===
INS ''Shivalik'' is equipped with a mix of [[Russia]]n, Indian and Western weapon systems.

A 32 cell VLS launched [[Barak 1|Barak SAM]] and [[AK-630]] act as [[Close-in weapon systems]](CIWS). The ship also carries two [[HAL Dhruv]] or [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] Mk. 42B helicopters.&lt;ref name=&quot;naval-technology1&quot;/&gt;

==Construction and service==
[[File:INS Shivalik construction.JPG|thumb|left|INS ''Shivalik'' during construction.]]
The construction of INS ''Shivalik'' began in 2000. Her keel was laid in July 2001. She was launched in June 2004 and was originally planned for commission by 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Chadha&quot;/&gt; However, she was commissioned in April 2010.

=== Operational history ===
In 2012, INS ''Shivalik'' was deployed in the [[Pacific Ocean|North West Pacific]] for JIMEX 2012 (Japan-India Maritime Exercise) with a four-ship group which included {{INS|Rana|D52|6}}, a {{sclass-|Rajput|destroyer|0}} [[guided missile destroyer]], {{INS|Shakti|A57|6}}, a {{sclass-|Deepak|fleet tanker}}, and {{INS|Karmuk|P64|6}}, a {{sclass-|Kora|corvette}} and took part in India's first bi-lateral maritime exercise with [[Japan]]. The [[Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force]] (JMSDF) was represented by two destroyers, one maritime patrol aircraft and a helicopter.&lt;ref name=ibn9j&gt;{{cite news|title=India, Japan to hold first naval exercise from today|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/india-japan-to-hold-first-naval-exercise-from-today/265085-3.html|accessdate=14 January 2013|newspaper=IBN Live|date=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four ships entered [[Tokyo]] on 5 June 2012 after visiting [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], [[Philippines]] and [[Republic of Korea]]. They stayed in Tokyo for three days. This visit coincided with commemoration of 60 years of diplomatic relations between India and Japan. [[Vice Admiral#India|Vice Admiral]] [[Anil Chopra (admiral)|Anil Chopra]], Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief [[Eastern Naval Command]], also visited Tokyo to witness the first JIMEX.&lt;ref name=indpr&gt;{{cite news|title=First bilateral maritime exercise between India and Japan|url=http://indiannavy.nic.in/sites/default/files/PRel_120609_JIMEX12_Indio-Japan-Ex.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2013|newspaper=Indian Navy Press Release|date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ndtv25j&gt;{{cite news|title=How Indian Navy is expanding and modernising|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/how-indian-navy-is-expanding-and-modernising-235746|accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper=NDTV|date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hin15j&gt;{{cite news|title=Japanese warships call at Kochi|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/japanese-warships-call-at-kochi/article3531095.ece|accessdate=17 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deployment in the north Pacific, the battle group was deployed in the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name=znj13&gt;{{cite news|title=Warm reception to Indian naval ships in China|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/warm-reception-to-indian-naval-ships-in-china_781647.html|accessdate=14 January 2013|newspaper=Zee News|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian warships to dock at Chinese port|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indian-warships-to-dock-at-chinese-port_781351.html|accessdate=14 January 2013|newspaper=Zee News|date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of India's [[Look East policy (India)|''Look East'' policy]], the ships visited the [[Shanghai]] port on 13 June 2012, for a five-day goodwill tour.&lt;ref name=ndtv25j /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/China/Indian-warships-to-dock-at-Chinese-port-after-6-yrs-gap/Article1-870003.aspx Indian warships to dock at Chinese port after 6 yrs gap]&lt;/ref&gt; INS ''Shakti'' served as the fuel and logistics tanker to the three destroyers. The ships left the port on 17 June 2012.&lt;ref name=ndtv19&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian warships wrap up China visit|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/indian-warships-wrap-up-china-visit-233603|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=NDTV|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before leaving the port, the ships conducted a routine passage exercise with the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Navy calls for trust building with India|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article3529270.ece|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=idsa&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Navy calls for trust building with India|url=http://idsa.in/TWIR/6_3_2012_National|work=THE WEEK IN REVIEW|publisher=IDSA|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orf&gt;{{cite web|last=Mohan|first=C Raja|title=Analysis: Japanese Navy|url=http://www.orfonline.org/cms/sites/orfonline/modules/analysis/AnalysisDetail.html?cmaid=38345&amp;mmacmaid=38346|publisher=Observer Research Foundation|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the visits to Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines, Japan, South Korea and China, the ships visited [[Port Klang]], [[Malaysia]]. This was the battle group's last port call during its two-month-long deployment, which had started in May 2012. After this she returned to the Eastern Fleet of the Indian Navy and since has been docked there.&lt;ref name=indpr /&gt;&lt;ref name=ndtv28&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian warships on goodwill tour, dock in Malaysia|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/indian-warships-on-goodwill-tour-dock-in-malaysia-237232|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=NDTV|date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nst&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian navy ships on 4-day visit|url=http://www.nst.com.my/nation/general/indian-navy-ships-on-4-day-visit-1.99103|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INS Shivalik participated in the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]]'s (PLAN) 65th anniversary celebrations held in [[Qingdao]]. India, Indonesia and China conducted three high level exercises including anti-hijack exercise. PLAN official who visited the ship mentioned that &quot;The Indian ship is a very strong ship with powerful weapons,&quot; and &quot;This gives us a good opportunity to see the Indian Navy&quot;. INS ''Shivalik'' sailed {{cvt|4500|nmi}} from [[Port Blair]] to Qingdao, without being assisted by any support vessel and without official from headquarters, showcasing the confidence of the crew and the autonomy they enjoy. PLAN and Indian Navy decided to further deepen the Naval bond between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/india-china-agree-to-deepen-naval-ties/article5948223.ece India, China agree to deepen naval ties after landmark exercise]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, this indigenous [[Stealth ship|stealth]] [[frigate]] actively participated in [[INDRA (Naval Exercise)|INDRA War Games]], a naval and army counter-terrorism exercise, with [[Russia]]. There ''Rajput''-class [[destroyer]] {{INS|Ranvijay||6}} and fleet tanker INS ''Shakti'' were also part of Indian fleet accompanying her.{{CN|date=October 2016}}
