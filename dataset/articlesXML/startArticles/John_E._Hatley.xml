'''John E. Hatley''' is a former [[Master Sergeant]] in the [[United States Army]] serving a 40-year sentence in the [[Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks]] for the murder of four Iraqi detainees. Hatley was originally sentenced to life with the chance for parole.&lt;ref name=clemency&gt;{{cite web |title=Army gives clemency to U.S.soldier convicted in slaying of 4 Iraqis |author=Chris Ball |publisher=cleveland.com |url=http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/06/army_gives_clemency_to_ussoldi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hatley is colloquially associated with a group of US military personnel convicted of [[war crimes]] known as the &quot;Leavenworth 10&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rally Supports 'Leavenworth 10' |author= |publisher=KMBC |url=http://www.kmbc.com/news/24885632/detail.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Leavenworth 10' families tell their stories |author=Earl Glynn |publisher=KansasWatchdog.org  |url=http://kansas.watchdog.org/5121/leavenworth-10-families-tell-their-stories/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Leavenworth 10' Freedom Ride | author=Earl Glynn | publisher=KansasWatchdog.org | url=http://kansas.watchdog.org/5103/leavenworth-10-freedom-ride/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Hatley was born in [[Decatur, Texas]] in 1968 to Darryl and Ann Hatley. One of five children, Hatley dropped out of high school and joined the United States Army, graduating [[United States Army Basic Training|Basic Training]] at [[Fort Benning]] in December 1989. He later earned his [[General Educational Development|GED]] and attended the [[University of Maryland]] while on active duty.&lt;ref name=djhbio&gt;{{cite web |title=Hatley Bio |author=Kim Hatley |publisher=Defend John Hatley |url=http://defendjohnhatley.com/hatleys-bio/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
After basic training Hatley was assigned to the Army's [[101st Airborne Division]] and deployed to Operations [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]] and [[Desert Storm]]. In 1999 Hatley deployed with the [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th Cavalry Regiment]] to [[Operation Joint Forge]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. In 2001 Hatley again deployed to the [[Balkans]] this time as part of [[Kosovo Force|Operation Joint Guardian II]] in Kosovo. The first of Hatley's two deployments to Iraq came in 2004 where he worked in the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]]'s Operations section. His second deployment was as the [[First Sergeant]] of Alpha Company of the 1st Battalion of the [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th Infantry Regiment]].&lt;ref name=djhbio /&gt;

===2006 Deployment to Iraq===
Hatley was patrolling with his unit in the [[Al Rashid, Baghdad|al Rashid]] district of [[Baghdad]] when they came under small arms fire. As the unit moved to storm a building, later found to contain smalls arms and explosives, four [[Shi'ite]] fighters associated with the [[Mahdi Army]] were caught fleeing the building and placed into custody.&lt;ref name=nytzielbauer&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Soldiers Executed Iraqis, Statements Say |author=[[Paul von Zielbauer]] |publisher=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/world/middleeast/27abuse.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin | date=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four detainees were taken back to the unit's staging area when Hatley's unit received word from their chain of command that the four men were likely to be released due to insufficient evidence.  According to the allegations, Hatley and two other senior non-commissioned officers took the four men to a remote location, handcuffed and blindfolded and placed them on their knees before shooting all four in the back of the head.  The bodies were subsequently dumped into a canal.   All members of the platoon were interviewed and admitted to either participating or witnessing the murders.

Prior to the beginning of the investigations into the murders, Hatley became involved in the [[Scott Thomas Beauchamp controversy]]. Hatley was serving as Beauchamp's Company First Sergeant in Iraq at the time that Beauchamp authored a diary published as an article in ''[[The New Republic]]'', an American Leftist political magazine. Subsequently a conservative blogger, looking for information on Beauchamp's claims, initiated an email exchange with Hatley. Hatley's response refuting Beauchamp's stories was then published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sergeant Who Smeared Fellow Soldier, New Republic Writer Executed Four Iraqi Men |author=Brian Beutler |publisher=Talking Points Memo |url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/04/sergeant_who_smeared_fellow_soldier_new_republic_w.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hatley was also involved in the Army's official criminal investigation into the article in ''The New Republic'' as necessitated by his position as the senior non-commissioned officer in Beauchamp's company.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Court Martial==
In April 2009 a U.S. Army court in [[Vilseck]], [[Germany]] found Hatley guilty of [[premeditated murder]] and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit premeditated murder over the killings at the canal in Baghdad.&lt;ref name=ncogetslife&gt;{{cite web|title=NCO gets life for slaying Iraqi detainees|author=Seth Robson|publisher=Stars and Stripes|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=62089}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to testimony given at his trial, Hatley, Sergeant First Class Joseph P. Mayo and Sergeant Michael Leahy had transported the [[detainees]] to a western neighborhood of the [[Al Rashid, Baghdad|Al Rashid]] district in [[Baghdad]], shot the bound and blindfolded men in the back of the head and then dumped their bodies in a canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IRAQ DEVELOPMENTS (wire)|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/printedition/2009/04/16/irglance0416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the murders the three American soldiers were assigned to Company A, 1st Battalion of the [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th Infantry Regiment]]. Hatley was sentenced to life in prison but will be eligible for parole after 20 years. He was reduced in rank to [[private (rank)|private]], [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]] and forfeited all pay and allowances.&lt;ref name=ncogetslife/&gt;
