== Merge ==
''It was suggested that this article is to be merged with [[Anderitum]]. Sept 2008''

There is no need for two short articles on the same structure. The modern name would seem the obvious one to use. In fact until Feb 07, when a now departed editor [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pevensey_Castle&amp;oldid=107173400 split them], surely against all policy, I see this was how they were.  [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 01:01, 30 September 2008 (UTC)

:Except they aren't actually the same structure. They are two separate and distinct structures, one encompassing the other, on a single site - but both are clearly visible in their own right.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/87.113.0.161|87.113.0.161]] ([[User talk:87.113.0.161|talk]]) 13:51, 23 October 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::I would have disagreed with the original split but as we now have two articles, I do not see any benefit with merging them back together again. Both articles are beyond a stub. They deal with different aspects of the site and are not duplicating the information. ++ [[User:MortimerCat|MortimerCat]] ([[User talk:MortimerCat|talk]]) 00:31, 4 December 2008 (UTC)

&lt;small&gt;As the discussion has stagnated, I have removed the merge tags. However the discussion can still continue. ++ [[User:MortimerCat|MortimerCat]] ([[User talk:MortimerCat|talk]]) 20:14, 19 December 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
:::It is not lack of duplication that is the problem, but lack of integration. That a castle was builty on the same ground as the fort was not pure coincidence, as the article and comments above rather imply; the Roman remains were part of the medieval plan of fortification. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 21:54, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

::::(Although this is stale)It is not unusual for a castle to be build over or inside a Roman fort, but that does not mean that there should not be two separate articles on the subject. The articles have clear and separate scopes, a Roman fort and a medieval castle; it is appropriate for each article to mention the other within context (essential in the castle's case as it reused the fort's walls), but a merger would not. The two are separately notable. [[User:Nev1|Nev1]] ([[User talk:Nev1|talk]]) 17:27, 1 January 2010 (UTC)
*Now (2014) this is massively longer, and has more on [[Anderitum]] than that article. I don't really mind if they are merged or not, but if not the Roman bits should be copied to the other article.  Great job anyay! [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 22:56, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

==Useful illustration?==
[[File:Pevensey Castle from the West.jpg|300px|right]]
To the right. It's only the inner ward, not the whole thing, but it's nice and clear. Worth including in the article? Could be used in the final section which mentions the well and foundations of the chapel (both visible), or perhaps as the lead image though admittedly the current lead shows the whole castle. [[User:Nev1|Nev1]] ([[User talk:Nev1|talk]]) 23:27, 3 December 2014 (UTC)

:Good suggestion, thank you - I've added it to the article. [[User:Prioryman|Prioryman]] ([[User talk:Prioryman|talk]]) 07:44, 4 December 2014 (UTC)
