'''James Brenton''' (1740–1782) was an [[American Revolutionary War]] officer. He was killed by [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] during the [[Battle of Blue Licks]] in [[Robertson County, Kentucky]] (then [[Kentucky County, Virginia]]). He married Rebecca Scott (1740-1771) abt. 1763 in Frederick County, Virginia, and then married Mary Woodfield (1750 – 1834) in 1772, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]].

==Background==
In 1768, James traveled over the [[Allegheny Mountains]] to Westmoreland County (now [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]]), Pennsylvania, where he settled near the [[Monongahela River]], neighboring [[Redstone Old Fort]] (now [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania|Brownsville]], [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania]]). It's likely that James and his brother William helped build Williams Cabin near [[Bedford Village Archeological Site|Old Bedford Village]], in [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania]].

In 1774, Brenton was commissioned a Captain by Colonel [[Angus McDonald (Virginia militiaman)|Angus McDonald]], who mustered roughly 400 men to take part in the Wakatomica Campaign of [[Dunmore's War]]. The [[Shawnee]] settlements of [[Wakatomika]] (present day [[Dresden, Ohio|Dresden]], [[Muskingum County, Ohio]]) as well as four other villages were burned. Three American Indian Chiefs were taken prisoner.

In 1777, he defended the frontier, serving as a [[First Lieutenant]] in the Virginia Rangers of [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]]. In 1779, he was promoted to [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]], and then to [[Major (United States)|Major]] by [[Patrick Henry]].

Later that year, James and his family relocated to [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky|Harrodsburg]], Kentucky County, Virginia (now [[Mercer County, Kentucky]]). They spent the winter in Harrodsburg, and in spring of 1780 settled on the south bank of Clarks Creek at the ford northeast of [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]] (now [[Boyle County, Kentucky]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brenton, Chester Fay, ''American descendants of Magistrate Brenton of Hammersmith, England'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1782, Brenton was commissioned a Major and made fifth in command of the [[Crawford expedition|Crawford Expedition]],&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, ''An Historical Account of the Expedition Against Sandusky Under Col. William Crawford in 1782'', 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Withers, Alexander Scott, ''Chronicles of Border Warfare; a History of the Settlement by the Whites'', 328.&lt;/ref&gt; intended to put an end to Indian attacks on frontier settlers. James Brenton (occasionally misspelled &quot;Brinton&quot;) was one of four majors elected for the expedition. The other Majors included [[David Williamson (Pennsylvania)|David Williamson]], [[Thomas Gaddis]], and [[John B. McClelland|John McClelland]].

According to Consul Willshire Butterfield, Major Brenton, &quot;''was a man of much spirit – a soldier, brave and active. Judging of his merits by his subsequent conduct, he unquestionably commanded the esteem as well as the confidence of the volunteers. His coolness and bravery in the face of imminent danger were long after alluded to by his surviving comrades, in terms of the highest commendation''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, ''An Historical Account of the Expedition Against Sandusky Under Col. William Crawford in 1782'', 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Brinton and Captain Bean were also scouts; observing two savages, upon whom they immediately fired, though without effect.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, ''An Historical Account of the Expedition Against Sandusky Under Col. William Crawford in 1782'', 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Brenton was wounded at the [[Battle of Sandusky#Battle of Sandusky|Battle of Sandusky]] and Daniel Leet subsequently took command of his division.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, ''An Historical Account of the Expedition Against Sandusky Under Col. William Crawford in 1782'', 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crawford's defeat by the Indians==
The song, &quot;[[Crawford's Defeat by the Indians]]&quot; mentions Major Brenton:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Parker B, ''Crawford's Defeat: A Ballad'', 313,323.&lt;/ref&gt;

:There was brave Major Brinton, the first in command
:In the front of the battle he boldly did stand
:With courage and conduct, his part did maintain
:Though, bullets like hail, in great showers they came

:And as this brave here was giving command
:The rifle balls rattled on every hand
:He received a ball, but his life did not yield
:He remained with the wounded men, out on the field

Shortly after returning from the Crawford Expedition, Brenton was mortally wounded at the [[Battle of Blue Licks]] on August 19, 1782. One of the last battles of the American Revolutionary War, Blue Licks took place near the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking River]], in what is now Robertson County, Kentucky (but was then Kentucky County, Virginia). Approximately 50 [[Loyalists#North America|Loyalists]] and 300 American Indians ambushed 182 frontier [[militia]]men.

James' son, also named James, was in the party which buried the dead after the Battle of Blue Licks. According to family legend, James brought his father's body back to Harrodsburg for burial.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky Historical Society, ''Kentucky Ancestors: Volumes 27-28''&lt;/ref&gt;
