The '''Caracal pistol''' is a series of [[semi-automatic pistols]] manufactured by Caracal International L.L.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caracal.ae/|title=Caracal International L.L.C. company website|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subsidiary of Tawazun Holding from the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The Caracal pistol series are the first pistols made in the United Arab Emirates.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Development==
Starting in 2002, a team of European weapons designers and experts working in conjunction with the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces started the development of a range of modern pistols and accessories. The research and development team was led by the [[Austria]]n firearms designer [[Wilhelm Bubits]] who previously had designed the [[Steyr M]] pistol.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref3&quot;/&gt;

Before being put into production the Caracal pistol was evaluated through independent tests.
These tests were carried out by the Federal German Armed Forces Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in Meppen, Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwb.org/01DB022000000001/CurrentBaseLink/W26AGHYF049INFOEN|title=Bundeswehr Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in Meppen|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included metallurgic and composite analysis, functional fitness-for-purpose and quality evaluation, endurance firing, environmental exposure, safety and accuracy tests.
A certificate was issued  by the Bundeswehr Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in May 2006 after the pistol successfully complied with the NATO D14 standard, the German Federal Police Standard and the German Federal Armed Forces Technical Purchasing requirements. These tests are the most stringent test protocols ever devised for a service firearm.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref3&quot;/&gt;

By the end of 2006, Caracal International L.L.C .was incorporated and registered as a company in Abu Dhabi. With that, the foundation of a pistol manufacturing industry was established for the first time in the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]].

The pistols were unveiled at the [[International Defence Exhibition]], IDEX 2007 in [[Abu Dhabi]].

In February 2007 25,000 Caracal F pistols in 9&amp;nbsp;mm were ordered by various armies and security forces of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;uaeinteract.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/docs/Caracal_International_wins_contracts_at_IDEX/24093.htm|title=Caracal International wins contracts at IDEX|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Caracal pistol is now the new service pistol of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Jordan as of April, 2008.
The United Arab Emirates and Algeria established on November, 17th, 2008 a joint committee in order to test the Caracal pistol for further adoption by Algeria.
The Caracal pistols were originally slated to be introduced into the European market and made available to Austrian customers in early 2009;&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref4&quot;&gt;[http://caracal-arms.info/caracal-pistol/caracal-pistol.html Caracal pistol, new service pistol] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203064854/http://caracal-arms.info/caracal-pistol/caracal-pistol.html |date=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was rectified at the [[International Defence Exhibition|IDEX 2009]] exhibition, when Caracal announced that an export line to Italy was to be started with &quot;the first samples delivered immediately after the IDEX&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uaeinteract.com/docs/Caracal_starts_sales_in_Europe/34474.htm|title=Caracal starts sales in Europe|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caracal pistols have been introduced on the Italian civilian/sport shooters market during the 2009 EXA expo ([[Brescia]], 18&amp;ndash;21 April 2009), and are being imported by the Italian arms company [[Tanfoglio|Fratelli Tanfoglio S.N.C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanfoglio.it/catalogo/caracal/|title=Caracal pistols on the FRATELLI TANFOGLIO S.N.C. online catalogue|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tanfoglio.it/uploads/docs/caracalprezzipubblico.pdf Price list for Caracal pistols on the FRATELLI TANFOGLIO S.N.C. online catalogue]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2009 Caracal received an export licence from the United States, which will enable it to ship its products to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfnews.com/business/General/10288874.html|title=Caracal to export UAE-made guns to US|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Caracal's commercial director Saeed Ali Al Shamsi, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] gave its approval for sales in the United States in May 2009 and the company plans to embark on a soft launch of the firearms in America in 2010 with the handguns selling for up to US$720 ([[United Arab Emirates dirham|AED]] 2,650) in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref4&quot;/&gt;

Besides the within NATO and many other militaries standard [[9×19mm Parabellum]] chambering, the manufacturer will offer this pistol also in the [[9×21mm]], [[.357 SIG]] and [[.40 S&amp;W|.40 Smith &amp; Wesson]] chamberings. At the IDEX 2009, the company announced that work is being carried on to manufacture the Caracal pistols in [[.45 ACP]], and that an SCHV (small-caliber/high-velocity) ammunition, along the lines of [[5.7×28mm]] and [[4.6×30mm]], is also under study for military customers.

In October 2013 the original Caracal pistol line was delisted by the manufacturer. The original model line was replaced by the CP660, CP661 and CP662 models that are very similar to the original Caracal F, C and SC pistol models, but feature redesigned slides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameinfo.com/caracal-international-unveils-generation-models-popular-353251 |title=Caracal International unveils next generation models from its three most popular product lines at Abu Dhabi International Hunting and Equestrian Exhibition ameinfo.com 2013-09-04 |publisher= |accessdate=24 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007002743/http://www.ameinfo.com/caracal-international-unveils-generation-models-popular-353251 |archivedate=7 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2013/09/08/caracal-revamps-pistol-line/|title=Caracal Revamps Entire Pistol Line gunsholstersandgear.com by Richard Johnson 2013-09-08|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guns.com/2013/09/09/caracal-recalls-c-models-rolls-new-pistols-across-board/|title=BREAKING: Caracal recalls all ‘C’ models, rolls out all-new pistol catalog guns.com by Max Slowik 2013-09-09|work=Guns.com|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the CP660, CP661 and CP662 models where delisted and the Caracal F and C where listed again. The new Carcal F and C models have two pins through the trigger mechanism, where the recalled models featured only one pin.

==Design details==

===Features===
The Caracal is a fully ambidextrous polymer framed pistol that features an ergonomically designed grip with a rounded butt and a grip angle of 111°.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref3&quot;/&gt; The lower forward edge of the frame has a mounting-bracket or [[Rail Integration System|rail interface system]] for mounting accessories.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jiw/jiw_a121.html|title=Caracal 9 mm self-loading pistol (United Arab Emirates)|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The pistol's low slide profile design holds the pistol barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the pistols more comfortable to shoot by reducing [[muzzle rise]] and allows faster aim recovery in rapid shooting sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;&gt;[http://www.caracal.ae/Caracal_Brochure.pdf Caracal Brochure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203030651/http://www.caracal.ae/Caracal_Brochure.pdf |date=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distance from the pistol barrel central axis to the top of the grip is {{convert|18|mm|abbr=on}}. This low [[bore axis]] principle is also found in the [[Glock pistol|Glock]], [[Steyr M]] and in the later developed [[Arsenal Firearms Strike One]] pistols.

The metal slide guide rails are designed to be as long as possible to promote stability, by reducing torsion and flexing of the grip frame, during firing and a close fit between the slide and grip frame for plenty direct mechanical interaction between the slide and grip frame. Furthermore, the rails being part of the frame sub assembly that bears all internals, it is easier to assemble the mechanism for manufacturing or disassemble for maintenance and replacement.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref3&quot;/&gt;

The pistols have a fully supported chamber and fixed [[iron sights]] featuring straight- [[Iron sights#Contrast enhancements|straight-eight pattern contrast enhancements]] of which the front element can be adjusted for windage. The unadjustbale rear sight element is an integral part of the firing pin unit and can only be changed by exchanging the entire firing pin unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref6&quot;&gt;[http://www.caracal.ae/new/downloads/User_Manual.pdf Caracal Safety &amp; Instruction User Manual] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227115856/http://www.caracal.ae/new/downloads/User_Manual.pdf |date=December 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pistols can be supplied with grip inserts in several distinctive colours (black, gray, green, blue and orange) that can be used for identification purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt; The grip size can not be adjusted with these grip inserts.

The metal parts receive a proprietary &quot;Plasox&quot; [[Nitriding#Plasma nitriding|plasma-based nitriding]] with an enclosed post-oxidizing surface treatment producing a protective coating resistant to aggressive environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubig.com/index.cfm/sprache/en/seite1/haertetechnik/seite2/dienstleistungen_ht/seite3/im_detail_ht/seite4/micropuls_plasmanitrieren_ht/seite5/plasox_ht.htm PLASOX - Plasma nitriding and oxidizing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctklj.ctk.uni-lj.si/kovine/izvodi/mit046/mueller.pdf Additional information regarding Plasox properties]&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturer claims that this proprietary [[Ferritic nitrocarburizing|protective layer]] method is relatively environmental friendly, is very durable and protects well against rust.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt;

There are however also two-tone Caracal pistols available with bright metal slides that did not receive the &quot;Plasox&quot; plasma-based nitriding surface treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caracalforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=26 Images of a two-tone Caracal F pistol] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425151522/http://www.caracalforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=26 |date=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the manufacturer the 28 parts and components these pistols are made of are interchangeable for easy production and maintenance. A take-down lever allows the pistol to be disassembled without tools by the user.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref6&quot;/&gt;

The pistol is supplied with two box magazines and a user manual, packed in a plastic carry case.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref6&quot;/&gt;

===Operating mechanism===
The Caracal is a [[Trigger (firearms)#Function|striker fired]] [[semi-automatic pistol]], meaning the trigger system is of the hammerless short double-action-only type.
A cocking indicator below the rear sight indicates visibly and tactilely if the pistol is cocked and ready to fire.
The trigger travel is {{convert|8|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} with a trigger pull of {{convert|22|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}.

===Safety===
The pistol features a triple safety system that secures the weapon against accidental discharge and consists of three independent safety mechanisms: an external [[Safety (firearms)#Integrated trigger safeties|integrated trigger safety]] and two automatic internal safeties – a firing pin safety and a drop safety.

The pistol has a [[loaded chamber indicator]] in the form of a witness opening at the rear of the chamber that allows the user to see from the top side of the slide if a cartridge is present in the chamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref6&quot;/&gt;

===Ammunition feeding===
The double-column type [[Magazine (firearm)|box magazine]] is released by an ambidextrous magazine release.

===Accessories===
Available factory accessories include a rigid shoulder stock, a tactical front grip which can be fitted to the optical mounting-bracket on the lower forward edge of the frame, a key-locking system to provide additional gun security when the pistol is not in use, a fibre glass front-sight insert, &quot;gutter pattern&quot; quick sights, self-luminous [[tritium]] powered [[Iron sights#Contrast enhancements|low light sights]], magazine loader and optical aiming sight mounting bracket.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt;

A custom-made modular holster has been designed by Sandro Amadini. Ghost International modular system holster's unique  patented retention system GSS (Ghost Safety System) has been adapted to Caracal pistols. The innovative Ghost modular system with its various base plates allowing high ride, medium ride, tactical ride carry as well as concealed carry enhances and complements Caracal pistols qualities.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref4&quot;/&gt;

==Variants==
[[Image:DCB Shooting Caracal XD.jpg|thumb|The Caracal F superimposed over the [[HS2000]] pistol contour]]

The pistol is available in 5 variants:

* '''Caracal F''' - Basic, full-size variant; original design
* '''Caracal C''' - Compact (reduced length and height) variant of the Caracal F
* '''Caracal SC''' - Subcompact pistol marketed as a primary weapon for government professionals who must conceal a handgun for job related situations, or as a secondary back up pistol;&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref3&quot;/&gt; no longer available in 2015

A version of the Caracal adapted to high velocity ammunition like the 4.6×30mm used in the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP7]] and the 5.7×28mm used in the [[FN P90]] and the [[FN Five-seven|FN Five-Seven]] would be under development. This could be linked to the desire for a neighbouring country to adopt either the H&amp;K MP7 or the FN P90 [[personal defense weapon]].

==Recall==
On Sept. 9th, 2013 a recall was issued for all model C pistols made by Caracal stating:

''Caracal is now issuing this recall of all Model C pistols in all markets, following the completion of a full investigation. Caracal is initiating this voluntary recall of Model C pistols because the safety of its customers is paramount. ''

''This recall affects all Model C pistols, including but not limited to those with serial numbers which start with the following letters: HM, AA, AD, AG, CA, CB, CC, CD, CE, CF, CG, CH, CI, CJ, CK, CL, CM, CN, CP, CR and CS.''

''If you own or have access to a Caracal Model C pistol, PLEASE DO NOT LOAD OR FIRE YOUR PISTOL. Please contact Caracal customer care immediately to arrange to have your Model C pistol returned. Caracal will provide you with a full refund of the purchase price of your Caracal Model C pistol or vouchers for other Caracal products. Unfortunately, the potential safety issues cannot be addressed through a repair of the Model C pistol and all Model C pistols must be returned for refund.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caracal.ae/new/Caracal%20C%20-%20Update%20Recall%20Notice%20-Sep%2013.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008021850/http://www.caracal.ae:80/new/Caracal%20C%20-%20Update%20Recall%20Notice%20-Sep%2013.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gunssavelives.net/gun-industry/breaking-all-caracal-c-pistols-permanently-recalled-no-fix-available/|title=BREAKING: ALL Caracal &quot;C&quot; Pistols Permanently Recalled – No Fix Available|work=Guns Save Lives|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
