'''HMS ''Apollo''''', the third ship of the [[Royal Navy]] to be named for the Greek god [[Apollo]], was a 38-gun [[Artois class frigate|''Artois''-class]] [[fifth rate]] [[frigate]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. She served during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], but her career ended after just four years in service when she was wrecked on the Haak sands off the Dutch coast.

==Construction==
''Apollo'' was ordered on 28 March 1793 and was laid down that month at the yards of John Perry &amp; Hanket, at [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=[[British Warships in the Age of Sail]]|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was launched on 18 March 1794 and was completed at [[Woolwich Dockyard]] on 23 September 1794.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colledge&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Colledge |title=Ships of the Royal Navy |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; She cost £13,577 to build; this rising to a total of £20,779 when the cost of fitting her for service was included.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
''Apollo'' was launched in March 1794 and commissioned in August under her first commander, Captain John Manley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; Her career began inauspiciously, when Manley accidentally ran her aground on sandbanks in the mouth of [[the Wash]] in late 1794. On Manley's orders the ship was lightened by the disposal over the side of her stores and several of her guns, after which she floated free of the sand. Her rudder had broken in the process, and after some difficulty she was sailed to [[Great Yarmouth]] for repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Grocott 1997, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1796, she and {{HMS|Doris|1795|2}} captured the French corvette [[HMS Barbuda (1780)|''Légère'']], of twenty-two 9-pounder guns and 168 men. ''Légère'' had left [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 4 June in company with three frigates. During her cruise she had captured six prizes. However, on 23 June she encountered the two British frigates at {{coord|48|30|N|8|28|W}}. After a 10-hour chase the British frigates finally caught up with her; a few shots were exchanged and then ''Légère'' struck.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=5 July 1796|issue=13909|startpage=644}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy took into her service as HMS ''Legere''.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield (2008), p.255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in December, ''Apollo'' and {{HMS|Polyphemus|1782|2}} were off the Irish coast when they captured the 14-gun French privateer schooner {{HMS|Deux Amis|1796|2}}, of 100 tons bm and 80 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=13970|startpage=31|date=10 January 1797}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy took her into service under her existing name.

In 1798 Captain [[Sir Peter Halkett, 6th Baronet|Peter Halkett]] was appointed to the command of ''Apollo''. ''Apollo'' shared with {{HMS|Cruizer|1797|2}}, {{HMS|Lutine|1793|2}}, and the [[Hired armed vessels|hired armed]] [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]] [[Hired armed cutter Rose|''Rose'']] om the proceeds from the capture on 13 May of the ''Houismon'', ''Welfart'', and ''Ouldst Kendt''.{{#tag:ref|A seaman's share of the prize money was worth 4s 6d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=4 November 1806|issue=15972|startpage=1452}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

==Fate==
An accident at sea in late 1798 forced ''Apollo'' back to port in Great Yarmouth and left her with a depleted crew. A [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]] pawl, or crossbar, had broken while the crew were raising the anchor, and the weight of the anchor and chain caused the remaining pawls to turn sharply as the anchor ran back out. Around thirty men were injured after being struck by the pawls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grocott67&quot;&gt;Grocott 1997, p67&lt;/ref&gt; Halkett gave orders for a prompt return to port, where the injured men were discharged from ''Apollo''{{'}}s service and entrusted to local medical care. The ship then put back to sea on 5 January, without replacing the injured crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grocott67&quot;/&gt;

Halkett's orders were to take ''Apollo'' to a point off the coast of Holland, and there to seek out Dutch vessels for capture. One such vessel was sighted on 6 January, and ''Apollo'' was turned to give chase. The pursuit was hampered by thick fog, and at 7am on the following morning ''Apollo'' ran aground on the Haak Sandbank adjacent to [[Texel]]. Halkett ordered that the ship's stores and guns be thrown overboard in order to lighten her and float her free, but despite these efforts she remained stuck fast in the sands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grocott67&quot;/&gt;

In the late afternoon, a Prussian [[galliot]] was sighted and hailed by ''Apollo''{{'}}s crew. After some  negotiation, the Prussian captain agreed to jettison the bulk of his cargo of wines and take 250 of ''Apollo''{{'}}s crew back to England. The remaining crew members went aboard ''Apollo''{{'}}s cutter with plans to make their own way to port. By 9pm all crew members had left the British ship, which was then abandoned to the tides. The Prussian ship reached Yarmouth on 11 January, followed three days later by the cutter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grocott67&quot;/&gt;

A Royal Navy court martial was established to examine the reasons for the loss of the ship. ''Apollo''{{'}}s pilot, John Bruce was found to have shown &quot;great want of skill&quot; in the execution of his duties, and he was dismissed forthwith from naval service.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper 1994, p.90&lt;/ref&gt; No findings were made against Captain Halkett, who returned to the Navy at his previous rank and was granted command of a newly completed 36-gun frigate, also named {{HMS|Apollo|1799|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield (2008), p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;
