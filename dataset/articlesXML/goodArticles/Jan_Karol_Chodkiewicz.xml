'''Jan Karol Chodkiewicz''' (''c''. 1560 –  24 September 1621; {{lang-be|Ян Караль Хадкевіч, ''Jan Karal Chadkievič''}}, {{lang-lt|Jonas Karolis Chodkevičius}}) was a military commander of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth army]] who was from 1601 Field [[Hetman]] of Lithuania, and from 1605 Grand Hetman of Lithuania, and was one of the most prominent [[szlachcic|noblemen]] and military commanders of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] of his era. His [[coat of arms]] was [[Chodkiewicz coat of arms|Chodkiewicz]], as was [[Chodkiewicz family|his family name]].

He played a major role, often as the top commander of the Commonwealth forces, in the [[Moldavian campaign#1599–1600|Wallachian campaign]] of 1599–1600, the [[Polish–Swedish War (1600–11)|Polish–Swedish War]] of 1600–11, the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)|Polish–Muscovite War]] of 1605–18, and the [[Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21)|Polish–Ottoman War]] of 1620–21. His most famous victory was the [[Battle of Kircholm]] in 1605, in which he dealt a major defeat to a Swedish army three time the size of his own. He died on the front lines during the [[Battle of Khotyn (1621)|battle of Chocim]], in the besieged [[Khotyn Fortress]], a few days before the [[Ottomans]] gave up on the siege and agreed to negotiate.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Jan Karal Chadkievič. Ян Караль Хадкевіч (MJ, XVII).jpg|thumb|left|Chodkiewicz, wearing a traditional costume of Polish magnates]]
Chodkiewicz was born around 1560 (exact date of his birth is unknown) as the son of [[Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz]], [[Grand Marshal of Lithuania]], [[castellan]] of [[Vilnius]] and [[Krystyna Zborowska]], daughter of a Polish [[magnate (Poland)|magnate]] family of [[Zborowski family|Zborowscy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb363&quot;/&gt; From 1573 he was a student at the Vilnius Jesuit College and the [[Vilnius University]], and from 1586 to 1589, together with his brother Aleksander, he continued his studies abroad at the [[University of Ingolstadt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb363&quot;/&gt; He visited [[Padua]] before returning to the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1590.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb363&quot;/&gt;

He started his military career soon after returning to the Commonwealth, raising a [[Rota (formation)|rota]] of 50 to 100 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb363&quot;/&gt; He gained military experience in the fight against the rebellious [[Cossacks]] during the [[Severyn Nalyvaiko]]'s [[Nalyvaiko uprising|uprising]] under [[Field Crown Hetman]] [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb363&quot;/&gt; During that conflict he participated in the battle of Kaniów on 14 April 1596, and in the siege of the Cossack [[tabor (formation)|tabor]] near [[Lubny]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb363&quot;/&gt; In 1599, he was appointed the Elder ([[starost]]) of [[Eldership of Samogitia|Samogitia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb363&quot;/&gt;

Chodkiewicz  subsequently assisted [[Chancellor]] and [[Great Crown Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]] in his victorious [[Moldavian campaign#1599–1600|Wallachian campaign]], in which Chodkiewicz  participated in the battle of Ploiești on 15 October 1600.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb363&quot;/&gt; For that campaign, he was given that year the high office of the [[Field Lithuanian Hetman]], the second commander-in-chief of the Lithuanian detachment of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt;

===War in the North===
[[File:Jan Karal Chadkievič. Ян Караль Хадкевіч (1750).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grand Hetman Chodkiewicz]]
A year later, in 1601, Chodkiewicz accompanied Zamoyski north, to the [[Duchy of Livonia]] (Inflanty), where he commanded Lithuanian units on the right wing of the Commonwealth army in a victorious [[battle of Kokenhausen]] in late July that year in the [[Polish–Swedish War (1600–11)|war against Sweden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt; He oversaw the fighting in the Livonia theater after Zamoyski's return to Poland in 1602.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt; &lt;!--Chodkiewicz, despite inadequate supplies and little support from the Commonwealth [[Sejm]] ([[parliament]]) and King [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]], brilliantly distinguished himself, capturing fortress after fortress and repulsing the duke of [[Södermanland]], afterwards [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]], from [[Riga]]. unref--&gt; In April 1603, he captured [[Dorpat]] (modern Tartu) and defeated the Swedish forces at [[Biały Kamień]] (the [[Battle of Weissenstein]]) on 23 September 1604.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt; His crowning achievement was the great victory near the [[Daugava River|Dvina]] River in the [[Battle of Kircholm]] (modern [[Salaspils]]) on  27 September 1605, when, with barely 4000 troops, mostly the heavy cavalry of [[Polish hussars]], he annihilated a Swedish army three times the size of his force.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt; For that feat he received letters of congratulation from [[Pope Paul V]], most of the Catholic royalty of Europe, and even the [[Ahmed I|sultan of Turkey]] and the [[Abbas I of Persia|shah of Persia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt; Soon afterward, he was rewarded with the rank of Grand Lithuanian Hetman, in addition to a number of royal land grants and leases.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt;

Yet this great victory was virtually fruitless, owing to the domestic dissensions; the [[Sejm]] (Commonwealth parliament) failed to agree on raising the funds needed for the war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- Chodkiewicz's own army, unpaid for years, abandoned him en masse in order to plunder the estates of their political opponents, leaving the hetman to carry on the war as best as he could with a handful of mercenaries paid out of the pockets of himself and his friends.--&gt; Chodkiewicz was one of the magnates who remained loyal to king [[Sigismund III]], and helped him to defeat the [[Sandomierz rebellion]] ([[rokosz]] of [[Mikołaj Zebrzydowski|Zebrzydowski]]) in 1606–1607.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt; He commanded the right wing of the royal army during the [[Battle of Guzów]] on 6–7 July 1607, in which the insurgents were defeated, and then quelled the unrest in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], fighting against another rebellious magnate, [[Janusz Radziwiłł (1579–1620)|Janusz Radziwiłł]], until Radziwiłł negotiated a settlement with the king in 1608.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt; A fresh invasion of Livonia by the Swedes recalled him thither once more, and in 1609 he relieved [[Riga]] and recaptured [[Pernau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb364&quot;/&gt; He improvised a [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy|small fleet]] and dealt a surprise blow to the [[Swedish Navy]] at the [[Battle of Salis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt;

===Wars in the East and South===
[[Image:HetmanChodkiewicz.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Jan Karol Chodkiewicz painted by [[Juliusz Kossak]]]]
Meanwhile, the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)|Dimitriad wars]] with [[Muscovy]] broke out. Instigated by King Zygmunt, the war was unpopular among Lithuanian magnates, and Chodkiewicz was no exception; in fact his displeasure was so public and significant that he lost the royal favor for a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; Eventually their differences subsided, and Chodkiewicz was sent against the Muscovites, operating first near [[Smolensk]] and [[Pskov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--with an army of 2,000--&gt; Soon, the Polish–Lithuanian forces started garnering victories, such as the [[Siege of Smolensk (1609–1611)|capture of Smolensk]], and some, like Grand Crown Hetman Żółkiewski, planned for a grand [[Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; Chodkiewicz was tasked by the king with an advance on Moscow.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; However, the Sejm neglected to pay for the maintenance of the Army once more, with the result that some units mutinied. Chodkiewicz fought several inconclusive battles against the Muscovites in the fall of 1611, and then retreated.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; Disappointed with that outcome, he became once again estranged from the king, and criticized the campaign at the Sejm of 1613.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; Over the next few years, in the period of 1613–15, Chodkiewicz defended the Commonwealth gains in the Smolensk area, and dealt with unrest in Lithuania.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt;  Not till the crown prince, [[Ladislaus IV of Poland|Władysław]] arrived with tardy reinforcements did the war could assume a more offensive character once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; The army, nominally commanded by Władysław, but in practice under the experienced command of Chodkiewicz, took the fortress of [[Dorogobuzh]] on 11 October 1617.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; &lt;!--During that campaign, among many officers under Chodkiewicz's command, was future hetman, [[Stanisław Koniecpolski]].--&gt; The siege of [[Mozhaysk]] in December of subsequent year did not prove successful, and this marked the end of the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Józef Brandt, Bitwa pod Chocimiem.jpg|thumb|250px|Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (in red) at Chocim, 1621]]

The Polish-Muscovite War had no sooner been ended by the [[treaty of Deulino]] than Chodkiewicz was hastily dispatched southwards to defend the southern frontier against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], who, in the opening phase of the [[Polish–Ottoman War (1620–1621)|Polish–Ottoman War]], defeated Polish forces at [[Battle of Ţuţora (1620)|Cecora]], killing Hetman Zółkiewski.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-138-139&quot;/&gt; An army of 160,000 [[Turkish people|Turks]] and 60,000 [[Tatars]] led by [[Sultan]] [[Osman II]] in person advanced &lt;!--from [[Adrianople]]--&gt; on the Polish frontier.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; Opposed it were the Commonwealth forces, numbering about 70,000, half of them a [[Cossack]] detachment under [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Cossack hetman]] [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; Chodkiewicz crossed the [[Dnieper]] in September 1621, and entrenched himself in the [[Khotyn Fortress]], directly in the path of the Ottoman advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; During the [[Battle of Khotyn (1621)|Battle of Chocim]] Chodkiewcz resisted the sultan's 200-thousand army for a whole month,&lt;!--, repelling all its assaults till the first fall of autumn snow compelled Osman to withdraw his diminished forces--&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Penson&quot;/&gt; but the cost of victory was his life. A few days before the siege was raised and the Ottomans decided to open negotiations, the aged Grand Lithuanian Hetman, already suffering from illness since the very start of this campaign, died in the fortress on 24 September 1621.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Penson&quot;/&gt;

Chodkiewcz's body was transported to [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], where he was buried on  14 October 1621.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb367&quot;/&gt; A few years later, in the summer of 1622, his widow arranged for exhumation, and Chodkiewicz was reburied in [[Ostróg]] in June that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb367&quot;/&gt; In 1627 he was moved to a new chapel in Ostróg, where he reburied again.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb367&quot;/&gt; His body was evacuated from Ostróg during the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] in 1648, and returned there in 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb367&quot;/&gt; It was reburied yet again in a new tomb in Ostróg in 1722.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb367&quot;/&gt;

==Assessment and remembrance==
[[File:Chodkevičius200906166.JPG|thumb|right|A monument to Chodkiewicz in [[Kretinga]], present day Lithuania]]
In 1937, Polish historian [[Wanda Dobrowolska]], wrote in her ''[[Polish Biographical Dictionary]]'' entry on Chodkiewicz that he was one of the chief members of the &quot;Great Hetman era&quot;, renowned for his talent as a strategist and organizer.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; She notes that Chodkiewicz possessed an iron will, which he was able to impose on the troops under his command, and that he was an efficient commander, although more respected and feared than beloved by his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb365&quot;/&gt; Dobrowolska notes that he was an energetic and explosive antithesis of the composed Żółkiewski, another great hetman of this era, whom Chodkiewicz disliked and competed with throughout his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb366&quot;/&gt;

Chodkiewicz was not particularly involved in the politics of the Commonwealth, although his high office and wealth gave him significant influence; for the most part he used his political influence, and base of support in Lithuania, to gather support for his military plans, increased the size of the army, and personal gratifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb366&quot;/&gt; His life was dominated by warfare, if not on the front lines, then on the political scene against other Lithuanian magnates, particularly the [[Radziwiłł family]] and the Sejm politicians whom he held responsible for not passing enough taxes to support the army he wanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb366&quot;/&gt;

Over his career he acquired significant wealth, and funded a number of churches and other prestigious buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb366&quot;/&gt; He often worked with the [[Jesuit]]s, including funding their [[Kražiai College|College in Kražiai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb366&quot;/&gt; He strongly believed his service for the state should be rewarded with land grants, but at the same time he would often use his own money to pay for the army's military expenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb366&quot;/&gt; In his private life he is remembered as a very proud individual, and for stressing his identity as a member of the [[Lithuanian nobility]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb366&quot;/&gt; He was a family man, devoted to his family, but his only son, from his marriage in 1593 to Zofia Mielecka, died aged 16 in 1613, and she died in 1618.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb366&quot;/&gt; He remarried in 1620, wedding Anna Alojza Ostrogska in  November 1620, shortly before departing on his final campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb367&quot;/&gt; Also that year his daughter Anna married a Lithuanian magnate, [[Jan Stanisław Sapieha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb367&quot;/&gt;

Some poems and other works praising him were written during his lifetime, and a religious work was dedicated to him by the Jesuit [[Piotr Skarga]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psb366&quot;/&gt; More works on Chodkiewicz were written in the years after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb366&quot;/&gt; He was one of [[Wacław Potocki]]'s characters in his epic novel on the Chocim war ({{lang-pl|Transakcja wojny chocimskiej}}), and he also appeared in the works of [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]] and [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]], usually portrayed as a patriot and military genius.&lt;ref name=&quot;psb367&quot;/&gt;
