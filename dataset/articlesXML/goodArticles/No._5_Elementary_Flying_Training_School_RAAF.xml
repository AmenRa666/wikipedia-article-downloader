'''No.&amp;nbsp;5 Elementary Flying Training School''' ('''No.&amp;nbsp;5 EFTS''') was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) pilot training unit that operated during World War&amp;nbsp;II. It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. No.&amp;nbsp;5 EFTS was established in June 1940 at [[RAAF Station Narromine|Narromine]], New South Wales, and primarily operated [[de Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]]s. It ceased training in June 1944, after more than 3,700 students had passed through.

==History==
[[File:Middleton at narromine.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.32|Students of No. 5 EFTS, including Ron Middleton (far right), later to be awarded the Victoria Cross|alt=Five men in light-coloured military uniforms with dark forage caps]]
Flying instruction in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Station Point Cook]], Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve elementary flying training schools (EFTS) and eight service flying training schools (SFTS).&lt;ref name=Stephens67&gt;Stephens (2006), pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf Gillison (1962), p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying) to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including sixty-five hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.&lt;ref name=Stephens67/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf Gillison (1962), pp. 106–109]&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;5 Elementary Flying Training School (No.&amp;nbsp;5 EFTS) was formed at [[RAAF Station Narromine|Narromine]], New South Wales, on 24&amp;nbsp;May 1940, and came under the control of [[Central Area Command (RAAF)|Central Area Command]], headquartered in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=RAAF399&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (2000), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Its inaugural commanding officer was [[Squadron Leader]] T.C. Curnow, who was previously in charge of [[No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Elementary Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Station Archerfield|Archerfield]], Queensland.&lt;ref name=Units&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;5 EFTS's airfield had been home to the Narromine Aero Club before being taken over by the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article132619696 |title=Narromine |newspaper=[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]] |location=Dubbo, New South Wales |date=30 April 1940 |accessdate=4 August 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Tiger Moth]] training aircraft were flown in from [[RAAF Williams|Laverton]], Victoria, on 24&amp;nbsp;June, and flying training commenced three days later when the first forty-six students arrived from [[No. 1 Initial Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School]].&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a month, student numbers had grown to ninety-four, and the school's total strength was 346.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;

As of 30&amp;nbsp;June 1940, only one of the No.&amp;nbsp;5 EFTS's four required hangars had been completed.&lt;ref name=RAAF399/&gt; Accommodation facilities were, according to the unit operations book, &quot;bleak and depressing&quot; and deficiencies in equipment were &quot;too numerous for itemising&quot;.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), pp. 399, 401&lt;/ref&gt; The primitive conditions meant that personnel suffered adverse health effects from the cold in winter and hot, dusty conditions in the summer. Flying at Narromine was also hampered by bad weather, particularly heavy rain and wind.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; Accidents were frequent at all EFTSs, though fatalities were rare. An instructor and his passenger from No.&amp;nbsp;5 EFTS were killed when a Tiger Moth crashed on 3&amp;nbsp;August 1940, possibly caused by a [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]] while practising forced landings.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of August, the school was operating one of its two required [[Link Trainer]] simulators.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 30&amp;nbsp;September 1940, total strength was 467, including 114 trainees.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; One student died and five others were injured off duty when the balcony of the Federal Hotel in Narromine collapsed on 11&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), pp. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt; An instructor was killed and his pupil injured when their Tiger Moth stalled while attempting to avoid collision with another aircraft on 3&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17701419 |title=RAAF pilot killed |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=4 December 1940 |accessdate=4 August 2014 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Squadron Leader [[Elwyn Roy King|Roy King]], a [[Flying ace|fighter ace]] in the [[Australian Flying Corps]] during World War&amp;nbsp;I, took over command of the school, serving until June 1941.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, some 500 pupils had graduated from No.&amp;nbsp;5 EFTS; the wastage rate was just under twenty per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; Among the graduates was [[Ron Middleton|R.H. (Ron)  Middleton]], who subsequently flew with the [[Royal Air Force]] in Europe and was awarded a posthumous [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions piloting a [[Short Stirling]] bomber in November 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens (2006), pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;

Night-flying training commenced at No.&amp;nbsp;5 EFTS in July 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; As of 30&amp;nbsp;April 1942, the school's strength was 845 personnel, including 319 students, the increase owing to an influx of staff and students from No.&amp;nbsp;2 EFTS and [[No. 6 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;6 Elementary Flying Training School]] in [[Tamworth Airport|Tamworth]], New South Wales, both of which had been disbanded in March.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), pp. 577, 583&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 17, 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=166516|title=Formation, Organisation &amp; Movement&amp;nbsp;– No. 1 Flying Training School|author=[[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]]|date=1941–47|page= 71|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; By July 1943, total strength stood at 748, including thirty-three members of the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]] (WAAAF); the unit was operating eighty-seven Tiger Moths and one [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]].&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 646&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1944, WAAAF numbers reached eighty-four out of a total strength of 703; the aircraft complement was eighty-six Tiger Moths, seventy-one of which were serviceable, and two [[CAC Wackett]]s, neither serviceable.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), pp. 667–668&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;48 Course passed out on 15&amp;nbsp;June 1944, after which training at the school ceased. Three other courses then under way were completed at other EFTSs. By 25&amp;nbsp;June, all of the school's Tiger Moths had been transferred to other locations. A total of 3,734 students had passed through No.&amp;nbsp;5 EFTS, 2,850 of whom graduated as pilots.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), pp. 681–684&lt;/ref&gt;
