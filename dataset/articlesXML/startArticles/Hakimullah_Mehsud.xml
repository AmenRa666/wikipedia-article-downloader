==Early years==
Hakimullah was born as Jamshed Mehsud&lt;ref name=dawn20100114/&gt; in the region of Kotkai near the town of [[Jandola]] in [[South Waziristan]] in 1979.

Mehsud was educated in a small village [[madrassa]] in [[Hangu District (Pakistan)|Hangu District]]. [[Baitullah Mehsud]] also attended the same school but eventually dropped out.&lt;ref name=bbcprofile/&gt;

==Militant activity==

===Jihad===
Jamshed Mehsud joined his clansman Baitullah in [[jihad]], initially as his bodyguard and aide.&lt;ref name=bbcprofile/&gt; He adopted the nom de guerre Zulfiqar, then later took the name Hakimullah, meaning one who has knowledge.&lt;ref name=dawn20100114/&gt; He gained a reputation within the Taliban for his battle skills with the [[AK-47]] and the [[Toyota]] [[pick-up truck]]. One Taliban member told a BBC correspondent that at the time Hakimullah's reputed skills were second only to [[Nek Muhammad Wazir|Nek Mohammad]].&lt;ref name=bbcprofile/&gt;

In 2004, he was made a spokesman.&lt;ref name=dawn20100114/&gt; He organised a series of raids against US military convoys between the summer of 2007 and the spring of 2008 that forced the closure of the [[Khyber Pass]] six times.&lt;ref name=roggio20100507&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2010/05/the_pakistani_taliba_1.php | title = The Pakistani Taliban's top leaders | accessdate = 8 February 2011 | last = Roggio | first = Bill | date = 7 May 2010 | work = The Long War Journal | publisher = Public Multimedia Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he was given command of the [[Orakzai Agency|Orakzai]], [[Khyber Agency|Khyber]] and [[Kurram district]]s.&lt;ref name=dawn20100114&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hakeemullah cultivates ruthless reputation |newspaper=Dawn |location=Pakistan |date=14 January 2010 |url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/03-hakeemullah-mehsud-cultivates-ruthless-reputation-ss-07 |accessdate=14 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117073133/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/03-hakeemullah-mehsud-cultivates-ruthless-reputation-ss-07 |archivedate=17 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tehrik-e-Taliban leadership ===
On 22 August 2009, Hakimullah Mehsud was appointed unanimously as the new leader of the Tehrik-e-Taliban by a 42-member shura.&lt;ref name=nytimes20090822/&gt;&lt;ref name=dt20090823&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 24 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts cited by ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|The Daily Times]]'' interpreted the appointment of the 28-year-old commander as a way to admit the death of Baitullah Mehsud although spokesmen for the group continued to vehemently deny his death, instead saying he was ill.&lt;ref name=dt20090823/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bitani, Alamgir|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSISL181950._CH_.2400|title=US says evidence Taliban chief dead 'pretty conclusive'|date=9 August 2009|agency=Reuters|accessdate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baitullah's successor====
Pakistani news channels reported on 8 August 2009 that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed after shooting erupted between his camp and that of [[Wali-ur-Rehman]] during a [[shura]] to determine the successor to the slain Baitullah Mehsud.  Interior Minister [[Rehman Malik]] could not confirm the death only that the fighting had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| quote =Pakistani news channels were carrying unconfirmed reports that Hakimullah Mehsud, one of the movement's most powerful commanders, had been killed at a shura, or council meeting, held to decide who would succeed slain leader Baitullah Mehsud.  &quot;The infighting was between Wali-ur-Rehman and Hakimullah Mehsud,” Interior Minister Rehman Malik told Reuters. &quot;We have information that one of them has been killed. Who was killed we will be able to say later after confirming.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August, a man claiming to be Hakimullah Mehsud called a Reuters reporter to declare that he and Baitullah were still alive.   While the reporter was certain that the call was authentic, Pakistani officials awaited voice analysis results and stated that intercepted phone calls led to the intelligence of Hakimullah's death.&lt;ref name=nytimes20090811&gt;{{cite news

Wali-ur-Rehman telephoned a Reuters reporter to say that Hakimullah is alive, and would be calling soon, and that the first shura where the shooting supposedly occurred never took place.

Hakimullah Mehsud appeared alongside [[suicide bomber]] [[Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi]] in an early January 2010 video that claimed responsibility for the [[Camp Chapman attack]] in retaliation for the death of Baitullah Mehsud.&lt;ref name=dawn20100115&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mehsud |first=Sailab |title=US drone targets Hakimullah Mehsud |newspaper=Dawn |location=Pakistan |publisher=Dawn Media Group |date=15 January 2010 |url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/19-suspected-drone-strikes-in-shaktoai-south-waziristan-casualties-feared-hh-05 |accessdate=14 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106185631/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/19-suspected-drone-strikes-in-shaktoai-south-waziristan-casualties-feared-hh-05 |archivedate=6 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8450102.stm | publisher=BBC News | title='CIA bomber' video indicates Taliban's reach | date=9 January 2010 | accessdate=4 May 2010 | first=M Ilyas | last=Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Hakimullah was seen in the execution video of [[Colonel Imam|Sultan Emir Tarar]], better known as Col Imam. Imam was kidnapped in March 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;liveleak.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Express / Online |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/121012/taliban-release-video-of-killing-of-col-imam/ |title=Taliban release video of killing of Col Imam |work=The Express Tribune |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rewards for capture==

===Pakistan bounty===
On 2 November 2009 Pakistani authorities offered a [[Pakistani rupee|Rs]]50 million ([[United States dollars|$]]600,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8337237.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Pakistan offers Taliban bounties | date=2 November 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; reward for information that lead to the capture or killing of Hakimullah Mehsud.

===United States bounty===
On 1 September 2010 the United States added the militant leader to its list of [[Specially Designated Global Terrorist]]s and the TTP to its list of [[Foreign Terrorist Organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Designations of Tehrik-E-Taliban Pakistan and Two Senior Leaders |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/09/146545.htm |publisher=U.S. State Department |date=1 September 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FBI]] posted a reward of [[United States dollars|$]]5 million for information leading to his capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/hakimullah-mehsud/view|title=Hakimullah Mehsud |publisher=FBI |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 1 November 2013, a senior Taliban source confirmed that a US [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] strike in Pakistan killed Mehsud in the village of [[Dande Darpa Khel]] in [[North Waziristan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews1&quot;/&gt; Dande Darpa Khel was the site of the [[Dande Darpa Khel airstrike]] in 2008. The drone strike also killed two other militants, along with his uncle and cousin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani Taliban confirm leader killed by drone|url=http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/international/asia/2013/11/pakistani_taliban_confirm_leader_killed_by_drone|newspaper=Boston Herald|date=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
