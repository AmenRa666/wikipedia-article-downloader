The '''29th Infantry Division''' ('''29th I.D.'''), also known as the &quot;'''Blue and Gray'''&quot;,&lt;ref name = SUD/&gt; is an [[infantry]] [[division (military)|division]] of the [[United States Army]] based in [[Fort Belvoir]], Virginia. It is a [[formation (military)|formation]] of the [[United States Army National Guard]] and contains units from [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]].

Formed in 1917, the division deployed to France as a part of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] during World War I. Called up for service again in World War II, the division's 116th Regiment, attached to the First Infantry Division, was in the first wave of troops ashore during [[Operation Overlord]], the landings in [[Normandy, France]]. It supported a special Ranger unit tasked with clearing strong points at [[Omaha Beach]]. The rest of the 29th ID came ashore later then advanced to [[Saint-Lô]], and eventually through France and into Germany itself. These actions have since been the subject of many motion pictures and video games.

Following the end of World War II, the division saw frequent reorganizations and deactivations. Although the 29th did not see combat through most of the next 50 years, it participated in numerous training exercises throughout the world. It eventually saw deployments to [[Bosnia]] ([[SFOR]]10) and [[Kosovo]] ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) as command elements, and units of the division continue to deploy to locations such as [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] and to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] as a part of the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terrorism]]'s [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], and also to the [[Iraq War]], as a part of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and Operation New Dawn.

==History==
The 29th Division was first constituted on paper 18 July 1917, three months after the [[American entry into World War I]], in the [[Army National Guard|U.S. Army National Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=John B. |last=Wilson |title=Armies, Corps, Divisions, and Separate Brigades |year=1999 |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |asin=B000OJKX1S| url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/060/60-7/| chapter = 29th Infantry Division }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|319}} The division's infantry units were the [[57th Infantry Brigade (United States)|57th Infantry Brigade]], made up of the [[113th Infantry Regiment (United States)|113th]] and [[114th Infantry Regiment (United States)|114th Infantry Regiment]]s, both from [[New Jersey]], and the [[58th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (United States)|58th Infantry Brigade]], made up of the [[115th Infantry Regiment (United States)|115th Infantry Regiment]] from [[Maryland]] and [[116th Infantry Regiment (United States)|116th Infantry Regiment]] from [[Virginia]]. Its artillery units were Maryland's 110th Artillery Regiment; Virginia's [[111th Field Artillery Regiment]]; and New Jersey's [[112th Artillery Regiment (United States)|112th Artillery Regiment]]. As the division was composed of men from states that had units that fought for both the North and South during the Civil War, it was nicknamed the &quot;Blue and Gray&quot; division, after the blue uniforms of the [[Union Army|Union]] and the gray uniforms of the [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] armies during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIOH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=6457&amp;CategoryId=3648&amp;grp=2&amp;menu=Uniformed%20Services&amp;ps=24&amp;p=0|title=29th Infantry Division|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[The Institute of Heraldry|The U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry]]|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division was actually organized on 25 August 1917 at [[Camp McClellan, Alabama|Camp McClellan]], [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|319}}

===World War I===
The division departed for the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in June 1918 to join the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF).&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;&gt;{{cite book | asin=B0006D8NKK | url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/cbtchron/cc/029id.htm | title=Army Almanac: A Book of Facts Concerning the Army of the United States | publisher=United States Government Printing Office | year=1959 | pages=531–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division's advance detachment reached [[Brest, France]] on 8 June. In late September, the&amp;nbsp;29th received orders to join the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]]'s [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]] as part of the French XVII Corps. During its 21 days in combat, the 29th Division advanced seven kilometers, captured 2,148 prisoners, and knocked out over 250 machine guns or artillery pieces. Thirty percent of the division became casualties—170 officers and 5,691 enlisted men were [[Killed in action|killed]] or [[Wounded in action|wounded]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/29id.htm |title=GlobalSecurity.org: 29th Infantry Division |work=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=2 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090624211249/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/29id.htm| archivedate= 24 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice with Germany]] was signed on November 11, 1918, ending hostilities between the [[Central Powers]] and the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]]. The division returned to the United States in May 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt; It demobilized on 30 May at [[Camp Dix]], New Jersey,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|319}} though it remained an active National Guard unit.

===World War II===
At the outbreak of [[World War II]], the U.S. Army began buildup and reorganization of its fighting forces. The division was reactivated into active service on 3 February 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt; Elements of the division were then sent to [[Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]] for training.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt; The 57th and 58th Brigades were inactivated as part of an army-wide removal of brigades from divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=John J. |last=McGrath |title= The Brigade: A History: Its Organization and Employment in the US Army |year=2004 |publisher=Combat Studies Institute Press |isbn=978-1-4404-4915-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|159}} Instead, the division was based around three infantry regiments; the [[115th Infantry Regiment (United States)|115th]], the [[116th Infantry Regiment (United States)|116th]], and [[175th Infantry Regiment (United States)|175th Infantry Regiment]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt;{{rp|592}} Also assigned to the division were the 110th, 111th, 224th, and 227th [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|Field Artillery]] Battalions, as well as the 29th [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal]] Company, the 729th [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance]] Company, the 29th [[Quartermaster]] Company, the 29th [[Reconnaissance]] Troop, the [[121st Engineer Battalion (United States)|121st Engineer Battalion]], the 104th [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Medical]] Battalion, and the 29th [[Counter-intelligence|Counter Intelligence]] Detachment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt;{{rp|592}} On 12 March 1942, over three months after the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent American entrance into World War II, with this reorganization complete the division was redesignated as the '''29th Infantry Division''' and began preparing for overseas deployment to Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|320}}

The 29th Infantry Division, under the command of Major General [[Leonard T. Gerow|Leonard Gerow]], was sent to [[England]] on 5 October 1942 on {{RMS|Queen Mary}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt; It was based throughout England and [[Scotland]], where it immediately began training for an invasion of northern Europe across the [[English Channel]]. In May 1943 the division moved to the [[Devon]]–[[Cornwall]] [[peninsula]] and started conducting simulated attacks against fortified positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt; At this time the division was assigned to [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] of the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Order128&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Order of Battle of the United States Army: World War II European Theater of Operations | publisher=Department of the Army | year=1945 | page=128 | isbn=978-0-16-001967-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hart&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Russell |last=Hart |title=The Second World War, Vol. 6: Northwest Europe 1944—1945  |year=2003 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-415-96850-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} In July the divisional commander, Major General Gerow, was promoted to command V Corps and Major General [[Charles H. Gerhardt|Charles Hunter Gerhardt]] assumed command of the division, remaining in this post for the rest of the war.

====Operation Overlord====
The cross-channel invasion of France finally came on June 6, 1944, [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], otherwise known as [[Operation Overlord]], codename for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]]. The 29th Infantry Division sent the 116th Infantry to support the western flank of the veteran [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]]'s [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)|16th Infantry]] at [[Omaha Beach]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vandervat2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Der Vat|first=Dan|title=D-Day: The Greatest Invasion-A People's History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=op0SdKZrC9kC|year=2010|publisher=Madison Press Books|isbn=978-1-897330-27-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}} Omaha was known to be the most difficult of the five landing beaches, due to its rough terrain and bluffs overlooking the beach, which had been well fortified by its German defenders of the [[352nd Infantry Division (Germany)|352nd Infantry Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vandervat2010&quot;/&gt;{{rp|86}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/AMH%20V2/index.htm | title=American Military History Volume II: The United States Army in a Global Era, 1917–2003 | publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] | last=Stewart | first=Richard W. | series=Army Historical Series | year=2005 | pages=148–49 | isbn=978-0-16-072541-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 116th Infantry was assigned four sectors of the beach; Easy Green, Dog Red, Dog White, and Dog Green. Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division boarded a large number of attack transports for the D-Day invasion, among them [[Landing craft]], [[Landing Ship, Tank]] and [[Landing Ship, Infantry]] ships and other vessels such as the {{SS|Empire Javelin}}, {{USS|Charles Carroll|APA-28|6}}, and [[USS LST-510|USS ''Buncombe County'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;vandervat2010&quot;/&gt;{{rp|86}}

[[File:Allied Invasion Force.jpg|thumb|300px|Allied battle plan for [[Operation Overlord]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]].]]

As the ships were traveling to the beach, the heavy seas, combined with the chaos of the fighting caused most of the landing force to be thrown off-course and most of the 116th Infantry missed its landing spots.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandervat2010&quot;/&gt;{{rp|95}} Most of the regiment's tank support, launched from too far off-shore, foundered and sank in the channel. The soldiers of the 116th Infantry began to hit the beach at 0630, coming under heavy fire from German fortifications. Company A of the 1st Battalion, 116th Infantry, from the Virginia National Guard in Bedford, Virginia was annihilated by overwhelming fire as it landed on the 116th's westernmost section of the beach, along with half of Company C of the [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Ranger Battalion]] which was landing to the west of the 116th.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandervat2010&quot;/&gt;{{rp|98}} The catastrophic losses suffered by this small Virginia community led to it being selected for the site of the National D-Day Memorial. The 1st Infantry Division's forces ran into similar fortifications on the eastern half of the beach, suffering massive casualties coming ashore. By 0830, the landings were called off for lack of space on the beach, as the Americans on Omaha Beach were unable to overcome German fortifications guarding the beach exits. [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley|Omar Nelson Bradley]], commanding the American First Army, considered evacuating the survivors and landing the rest of the divisions elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;hart&quot;/&gt;{{rp|29}}&lt;ref name=&quot;vandervat2010&quot;/&gt;{{rp|100}} However, by noon, elements of the American forces had been able to organize and advance off the beach, and the landings resumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandervat2010&quot;/&gt;{{rp|103}} By nightfall, the division headquarters landed on the beach with about 60 percent of the division's total strength, and began organizing the push inland. On 7 June, a second wave of 20,000 reinforcements from both the 1st and 29th Divisions was sent ashore. By the end of D-Day, 2,400 men from the two divisions had become casualties on Omaha Beach.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandervat2010&quot;/&gt;{{rp|106–7}} Added to casualties at other beaches and air-drops made the total casualties for the Normandy landings 6,500 Americans and 3,000 British and Canadians, lighter numbers than expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart&quot;/&gt;

[[File:TrebahDDay.JPG|thumb|left|Memorial of the 29th Infantry Division's embarkation for D-Day in [[Trebah]], England.]]

The entire division had landed in Normandy by 7 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order128&quot;/&gt;{{rp|122}} By 9 June, Omaha Beach was secure and the division occupied [[Isigny-le-Buat|Isigny]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt; On 14 July, the division was reassigned to [[XIX Corps (United States)|XIX Corps]], part of the First Army, itself part of the [[Twelfth United States Army Group|12th Army Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Order128&quot;/&gt;

====Breakout====
The division cut across the [[Elle River]] and advanced slowly toward [[Saint-Lô]], fighting bitterly in the Normandy hedge rows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitaker|first1=Denis|author2=Shelagh Whitaker|author3=Terry Copp|title=Normandy: The Real Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIMlgF43OyEC&amp;pg=PP7|publisher=Random House, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=978-0-345-45907-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} German reserves formed a new defensive front outside the town, and American forces fought a fierce battle with them two miles outside of the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;hart&quot;/&gt;{{rp|31}} German forces used the dense [[bocage]] foliage to their advantage, mounting fierce resistance in house to house fighting in the ravaged Saint-Lô. By the end of the fight, the Germans were relying on artillery support to hold the town following the depletion of the infantry contingent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;/&gt;{{rp|72–73}} The 29th Division, which was already undermanned after heavy casualties on D-Day, was even further depleted in the intense fighting for Saint-Lô. Eventually, the 29th was able to capture the city in a direct assault, supported by [[airstrikes]] from [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;/&gt;{{rp|74–75}}

After taking Saint-Lô, on 18 July, the division joined in the battle for [[Vire]], capturing that strongly held city by 7 August. it continued to face stiff German resistance as it advanced to key positions southeast of Saint-Lô&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;/&gt;{{rp|105}} It was then reassigned to V Corps, and then again to [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Order128&quot;/&gt; Turning west, the 29th took part in the assault on [[Brest, France|Brest]] which lasted from 25 August until 18 September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt; After a short rest, the division returned to XIX Corps and moved to defensive positions along the Teveren-[[Geilenkirchen]] line in Germany and maintained those positions through October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt; On 16 November, the division began its drive to the [[Roer River]], blasting its way through Siersdorf, [[Setterich]], Durboslar, and [[Bettendorf, Germany|Bettendorf]], and reaching the Roer by the end of the month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt; Heavy fighting reduced Jülich Sportplatz and the [[Hasenfeld Gut]] on 8 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt;

From 8 December 1944 to 23 February 1945, the division was assigned to [[XIII Corps (United States)|XIII Corps]] and held defensive positions along the [[Rur]] and prepared for the next major offensive. The division was reassigned to XIX Corps,&lt;ref name=&quot;Order128&quot;/&gt; and the attack jumped off across the Rur on 23 February, and carried the division through [[Jülich]], [[Jülich#Boroughs|Broich]], [[Immerath (Erkelenz)|Immerath]], and [[Titz]], to [[Mönchengladbach]] by 1 March 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt; The division was out of combat in March. In early April the division was reassigned to XVI Corps, where the 116th Infantry helped mop up in the Ruhr area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order128&quot;/&gt; On 19 April 1945 the division, assigned to XIII Corps, pushed to the [[Elbe River]] and held defensive positions until 4 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, the 175th Infantry cleared the [[Klotze Forest]]. After [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]], the division was on military duty in the [[Bremen enclave]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac531&quot;/&gt; It was assigned to XVI Corps again for this assignment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order128&quot;/&gt;

====Losses, decorations, demobilization====
From July 1943, the 29th Infantry Division was commanded by Major General Charles H. Gerhardt. The division had such a high casualty rate that it was said that Gerhardt actually commanded three divisions: one on the field of battle, one in the hospital and one in the cemetery. The 29th Infantry Division lost 3,720 [[killed in action]], 15,403 [[wounded in action]], 462 [[missing in action]], 526 [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], and 8,665 non-combat casualties, for a total of 28,776 casualties during 242 days of combat. This amounted to over 200 percent of the division's normal strength. The division, in turn, took 38,912 German prisoners of war.

Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division were awarded five [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]], 44 [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]es, one [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]], 854 [[Silver Star Medal]]s, 17 [[Legion of Merit]] Medals, 24 [[Soldiers' Medal]]s, 6,308 [[Bronze Star Medal]]s, and 176 [[Air Medal]]s during the conflict. The division itself was awarded four [[distinguished unit citation]]s and four [[campaign streamers]] for the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order128&quot;/&gt;{{rp|123}}

The division remained on occupation duty until the end of 1945. [[Camp Grohn]] near Bremen was the division headquarters until January 1946. The 29th Infantry Division returned to the United States in January 1946 and was demobilized and inactivated on 17 January 1946 at [[Camp Kilmer]], [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|321}}

===Reactivation===
On 23 October 1946, the division was reactivated in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|320}} However, its subordinate elements were not fully manned and activated for several years. It resumed its National Guard status, seeing weekend and summer training assignments but no major contingencies over the next few years.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt;

In 1959, the division was reorganized under the [[Pentomic]] five battle group division organization. Ewing's ''29th Infantry Division: A Short History of a Fighting Division'' says that several Maryland infantry and engineer companies were reorganized to form 1st Med Tank Bn, 115th Armor; the 29th Aviation Company was established; and the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron, [[183rd Armored Regiment (United States)|183rd Armor]], was established in Virginia as the division's reconnaissance squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNVBcDLiMXUC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=%22Pentomic+division%22+%22Army+National+Guard%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=06TYntSnd6&amp;sig=zx_a461zr1cqfWeqNjJhnzTmBe4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oeHBUq6pPNGciQef2oCoDg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pentomic%20division%22%20%22Army%20National%20Guard%22&amp;f=false |title=29th Infantry Division: A Short History of a Fighting Division - Joseph H. Ewing - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1963, the division was reorganized in accordance with the [[Reorganization Objective Army Division]]s plan, eliminating its regimental commands in favor of brigades. The division took command of 1st Brigade, 29th Infantry Division and 2nd Brigade, 29th Infantry Division of the Virginia Army National Guard,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|322}} as well as 3rd Brigade, 29th Infantry Division of the Maryland Army National Guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|323}} The division continued its service in the National Guard under this new organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt;

In 1968, in the middle of the [[Vietnam War]], the Army inactivated several National Guard and Reserve divisions as part of a realignment of resources. The 29th Infantry Division was one of the divisions inactivated. During that time, the division's subordinate units were reassigned to other National Guard divisions. 1st Brigade was inactivated, while 2nd Brigade was redesignated as the [[116th Infantry Brigade (United States)|116th Infantry Brigade]], and the 3rd Brigade was redesignated as 3rd Brigade, [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath&quot;/&gt;{{rp|193–94}}

On 6 June 1984, 40 years after the landings on Omaha Beach, the Army announced that it would reactivate the 29th Infantry Division, organized as a light infantry division, as part of a reorganization of the National Guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt; On 30 September 1985, the division was reactivated at [[Fort Belvoir]], Virginia, with a detachment in Maryland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|320}} The 116th Infantry Brigade was redesignated the 1st Brigade, 29th Division, while the 58th Infantry Brigade became the 3rd Brigade.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath&quot;/&gt;{{rp|194}} That year, the division also received its [[distinctive unit insignia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIOH&quot;/&gt;

===Post Cold War===
At the end of the [[Cold War]], the Army saw further drawdowns and reductions in spending. The 29th Infantry Division was retained, however 2nd Brigade was inactivated in favor of assets from the inactivating [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th Infantry Division]], which was redesignated the 26th Brigade, 29th Infantry Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath&quot;/&gt;{{rp|194}}

The largest National Guard training exercise ever held in Virginia took place in July 1998, bringing units from the 29th Infantry Division together for one large infantry exercise. The Division Maneuver Exercise, dubbed Operation Chindit, brought together Guard units from Virginia and Maryland, as well as [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. The exercise began with the insertion of troops from the 29th Infantry Division's 1st and 3rd Brigades by [[UH-60 Blackhawk]] helicopters into strategic landing zones. NATO-member forces trained with the 29th Infantry Division throughout the exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt; In December 2008, the division also dispatched a task force to Camp Asaka near [[Tokyo, Japan]] for exercises with the [[Japanese Ground Self Defense Force]] called [[Yama Sakura 55]], an bilateral exercise simulating an invasion of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.staffordcountysun.com/news/article_783e5ffe-3a4e-5099-8641-ded5ac85efe7.html | title=Military News | publisher=Stafford County Sun | date=22 January 2009 | accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.army.mil/article/15010/yama-sakura-tests-us-army-pacifics-new-command-posts/ | title=Yama Sakura tests U.S. Army, Pacific's new command posts | publisher=U.S. Army Homepage | date=10 December 2008 | accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day===
[[File:29 INF DIV Exercise.jpg|thumb|29th Infantry Division soldiers conduct a large-scale exercise at [[Camp Bondsteel]], [[Kosovo]].]]
Hundreds of soldiers from the 29th Infantry Division completed nine days of training on 16 June 2001 at [[Fort Polk, Louisiana|Fort Polk]], Louisiana, to prepare for their peacekeeping mission in [[Bosnia]], as the second division headquarters to be deployed as a part of [[SFOR]] 10. In all, 2,085 National Guard soldiers from 16 states from [[Massachusetts]] to California served with the multinational force that operated in the US sector, MND-N. Their rotation began in October 2001 and lasted six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt;

The 29th Infantry Division completed a two-week warfighter exercise at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas in late July 2003. Nearly 1,200 soldiers of the division participated in the training, which was overseen by [[First United States Army]]. Also engaged in the simulation war were about 150 soldiers of the [[New York Army National Guard]]'s [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]]. The exercises covered a variety of operations, ranging from large scale contingencies to airborne and civil affairs operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt;

In March 2004, the 3rd Battalion 116th Infantry of 500+ soldiers was mobilized for 579 days in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan.  Following 4 month train up, the battalion deployed to Bagram Air Base Afghanistan where the unit split into two operational elements.  One element was stationed at Bagram where they were responsible for near base security and the theater-north Quick Reaction Force.  They executed 5, 10, and 20 kilometer ring patrols to increase force security and stayed ready to react at a moments notice to deploy anywhere in Afghanistan to react to &quot;troops in contact&quot; that requested support.  The other element moved south with the Bn Commander to control and shape operations in the Wardak and Ghazni provinces.  It was here that the 116th would take its first casualties by enemy contact since WWII.  SGT Bobby Beasley and SSG Craig Cherry were killed in an IED attack on a patrol in southern Ghazni near Gilan.  Within the first three months, the unit would deploy nearly every soldier around Bagram, and throughout the Wardak and Ghazni provinces during the first Afghan elections in which President Hamid Karzai was elected.  The unit would redeploy back to the United States in July 2005 highly decorated for its efforts during their mission following hundreds of successful combat patrols and engagements.

In 2005, 350 veterans, politicians, and soldiers representing the division went to Normandy and Paris, in France for the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The Army National Guard organized a major ceremony for the 60th anniversary, as many of the veterans who participated in the invasion were in their 80s at that time, and the 60th anniversary was seen as the last major anniversary of the landings in which a large number of veterans could take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wtopnews.com/index.php?nid=372&amp;pid=0&amp;sid=208980&amp;page=1 |title=Md.

The division underwent major reorganization in 2006. A [[special troops battalion]] was added to the division's command structure, and its three brigades were redesignated. It as organized around three brigades; the [[30th Heavy Brigade Combat Team (United States)|30th Heavy Brigade Combat Team]] of [[North Carolina]], the [[116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]] of Virginia, and the [[Combat Aviation Brigade]], 29th Infantry Division of Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belvoireagleonline.com/news/battalion-holds-its-first-change-of-command/article_7c31c95c-9777-53fc-b422-eae4148cf7ae.html|title=Battalion holds its first change of command|last=|first=|date=12 July 2007|publisher=|work=The Fort Belvoir Eagle|accessdate=6 August 2014|author=LeDoux, Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, the division took command of the Eastern region of [[Kosovo]]'s peacekeeping force, to provide security in the region. The division's soldiers were part of a NATO multi-national task force consisting of units from the Ukraine, Greece, Poland, Romania, Armenia and Lithuania under the command of U.S. Army Brigadier General Douglas B. Earhart who concurrently served as the 29th's Deputy Commanding General.  The division returned to Fort Belvoir in November 2007.

After a three-month pre-deployment train-up at [[Camp Shelby]], MS, the [[116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]] deployed to [[Kuwait]] and [[Iraq]] in September, 2007, as part of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], returning home in May 2008.

Approximately 72 Virginia and Maryland National Guard Soldiers with the 29th ID deployed to Afghanistan from December 2010 to October 2011. As part of the 29th ID Security Partnering Team, the Soldiers were assigned to NATO's International Security Assistance Force Joint Command Security Partnering Team with the mission of assisting with the growth and development of the Afghan National Security Forces where they served as advisers and mentors to senior Afghan leaders. They were part of a NATO Coalition of 49 troop-contributing nations that Security Partnering personnel interacted with daily across Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vko.va.ngb.army.mil/virginiaguard/news/nov10/ADABdeparture.html |title=29th Division ADAB says farewell during ceremony |publisher=Vko.va.ngb.army.mil |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Virginia National Guard |url=http://vaguard.dodlive.mil/2012/02/09/20/ |title=Freedom Salute honors 29th Infantry Division service in Afghanistan |publisher=Vaguard.dodlive.mil |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vko.va.ngb.army.mil/virginiaguard/news/oct11/29IDSPreturn.html |title=Soldiers from the 29th Infantry Division return from duty in Afghanistan |publisher=Vko.va.ngb.army.mil |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
