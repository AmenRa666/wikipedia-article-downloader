The '''1999 F-117A shootdown''' was an event that took place on 27 March 1999, during the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], (Operation Allied Force, Operation Noble Anvil), when an [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Army of Yugoslavia]] unit used a [[S-125 Neva/Pechora]] to down a [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] [[stealth aircraft]] of the [[United States Air Force]]. The pilot ejected and was rescued by [[search and rescue]] forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logan, Don 2009&quot;/&gt;

The U.S. Air Force F-117A was developed in the 1970s, entering service in 1983 and officially revealed in 1988.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; It saw its first combat in 1989 over Panama, and was widely seen as one of the most advanced pieces of U.S. military equipment.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; At the same time, Yugoslavian air defenses were seen as relatively obsolete.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

==Downing==
[[File:S125 Neva 250 brPVO VS, september 01, 2012.jpg|thumb|left|S-125 Neva air defence system, from the Serbian 250th Air Defence Brigade, on display at a public open day (2012)]]
Unknown to NATO, Yugoslav air defenses operators had found they could detect F-117s with their obsolete Soviet radars after some modifications.&lt;ref name=usatoday2/&gt; In 2005, Colonel [[Zoltán Dani]] confirmed this in an interview, suggesting that those modifications involved using long wavelengths, which allowed them to detect the aircraft when the wheel well or bomb bay doors were open.&lt;ref name=mo/&gt; In addition, the Serbs had also intercepted and deciphered some NATO communications, and thus were able to deploy their anti-air batteries at positions best suited to intercept NATO planes.&lt;ref name=&quot;mo&quot;/&gt;

On 27 March 1999, the 3rd Battalion of the [[250th Air Defence Missile Brigade]] of the [[Army of Yugoslavia (FRY)|Army of Yugoslavia]], under the command of Colonel Dani, downed F-117 Air Force serial number ''82-0806'', callsign &quot;Vega 31&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;archive&quot;/&gt;

The Army of Yugoslavia unit was equipped with a Yugoslav version of the Soviet [[S-125 Neva/Pechora|Isayev S-125 &quot;Neva&quot;]] missile system ([[NATO reporting name]], ''SA-3 &quot;Goa&quot;'').&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The S-125 was initially deployed by the Soviet Union in 1961. The ''V-600'' or ''V-601'' missiles launched by the S-125 were {{convert|6.09|m|ft}} long, weighed {{convert|935|kg|lb}} at launch, could reach a speed of Mach 3–3.5 and carried a {{convert|60|or|70|kg|lb}} warhead.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Logan, Don 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;strategypage&quot;/&gt;

At about 8:15&amp;nbsp;pm local time, with a range of about {{convert|8|mi|km}} several missiles were launched. According to Sergeant Dragan Matić, who was identified in 2009 as the soldier who fired the missiles, they detected the F-117 at a range of about {{convert|50|to|60|km|mi}}, operating their equipment for no more than 17 seconds to avoid being locked on to by NATO anti-air suppression.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; According to Dani in a 2007 interview, his troops spotted the aircraft on radar when its bomb-bay doors opened, raising its radar signature.&lt;ref name=&quot;archive1&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Dale Zelko.jpg|thumb|[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]] Dale Zelko was the pilot of the downed F-117A]]
The F-117, callsign &quot;''Vega-31''&quot;, was being flown by Lt. Col. Dale Zelko,&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;airforces&quot;/&gt; an [[Operation Desert Storm]] veteran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nighthawks2007&quot; /&gt; He observed the two missiles punch through the low cloud cover and head straight for his aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dale Zelko lecture for the USAF museum during 2006|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/podcasts/lecture.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230141045/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/podcasts/lecture.asp|archivedate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first passed over him, close enough to cause buffeting, but did not detonate. The second missile detonated, causing significant damage to the aircraft and causing it to tumble, out of control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nighthawks2007&quot; /&gt; The explosion was large enough to be seen from a [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135 Stratotanker]], flying over [[Bosnia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nighthawks2007&quot; /&gt;

Zelko was subject to intense g-forces as the aircraft tumbled and had great difficulty in assuming the correct posture for ejecting. After his parachute deployed, he used his survival radio to issue a mayday call and was able to contact the KC-135 that had seen him shot down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nighthawks2007&quot; /&gt; Zelko used his survival radio while still descending although this was contrary to his training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nighthawks2007&quot; /&gt; He reasoned the altitude would give his signal the best possible range and was also sure he would be quickly taken prisoner by Yugoslavian forces on the ground and wanted to confirm he was unhurt before this happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nighthawks2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://f117sfa.org/sfa_newsletter/Newsletter2007-05.pdf | title=Interview with Lt Colonel Dale Zelko, USAF | journal=Nighthawks |date=May 2007 | volume=5 | issue=1 | publisher=F-117 Stealth Fighter Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zelko landed in a field south of [[Ruma]] and around a mile south of a four-lane highway.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The [[European route E70]]&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly concealed himself in a drainage ditch that he had identified as a hole-up site while descending.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nighthawks2007&quot; /&gt; There, he felt the shock waves of American bombs dropped by [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 bombers]] on targets on the outskirts of Belgrade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nighthawks2007&quot; /&gt; Zelko landed around a mile from his aircraft's crash site, and an intensive search of the area was carried out by the Yugoslav soldiers, police and local villagers. At one point, searchers came within a few hundred yards of the ditch he was hiding in. Zelko was rescued approximately eight hours later by a U.S. Air Force [[combat search and rescue]] team flying in a [[Sikorsky MH-53]] helicopter in the early hours of the next morning. According to Zelko, he would later learn that he had been minutes away from being captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nighthawks2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rd.com/true-stories/inspiring/the-stranger-who-changed-my-life-my-enemy-my-friend/ The Stranger Who Changed My Life: My Enemy, My Friend | Reader's Digest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially misidentified in press reports, as the name &quot;Capt Ken 'Wiz' Dwelle&quot; was painted on the aircraft's canopy. The lost F-117 carried the name &quot;Something Wicked&quot; and had previously flown 39 sorties during [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.f-117a.com/Serial.html | title=F-117A Serial Listings | publisher=www.f-117a.com | accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade also shot down a USAF [[F-16]] fighter on 2 May 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;holloman&quot;&gt;Roberts, Chris.

Photographs show that the aircraft struck the ground at low speed in an inverted position, and that the airframe remained relatively intact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logan, Don 2009&quot;/&gt; Some pieces of the F-117's wreckage are preserved at the Serbian [[Museum of Aviation (Belgrade)|Museum of Aviation]] in [[Belgrade]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Museum, Belgrade, Serbia Photo Gallery by Vlado Marinkovic at&quot;/&gt; other pieces of wreckage were reportedly sent to Russia and China, to be used in  developing anti-stealth technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsmax&quot;/&gt; The USAF retired the F-117 in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATRetire&quot;/&gt;

Zoltán Dani, now running a bakery, and Dale Zelko, now retired from the US Air Force, have met and developed a friendship in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20209770 | title=Foes now friends: US stealth pilot and the Serb who shot him down | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | work=BBC News | date=November 6, 2012 | accessdate=November 14, 2012 | author=De Launey, Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
