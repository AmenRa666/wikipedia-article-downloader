The '''''U-3'' class''' was a [[ship class|class]] of two [[submarine]]s or [[U-boats]] built for and operated by the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine ''or'' K.u.K. Kriegsmarine}}). The ''U-3''-class boats were designed and built by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] of [[Kiel]], Germany. The class was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's efforts to competitively evaluate three foreign submarine designs.

The two ''U-3''-class boats, both launched in 1908, were just under {{convert|140|ft|m}} long and were each powered by two [[kerosene]] [[two-stroke engine]]s while surfaced, and two [[electric motor]]s when submerged. The ''U-3'' class initially had diving problems that were alleviated after several modifications to fins and [[diving plane]]s. Both boats of the class served in combat during [[World War I]]. {{SMU|U-3|Austria-Hungary|2}}, the [[lead ship|lead boat]] of the class, was sunk by gunfire in August 1915. {{SMU|U-4|Austria-Hungary|2}} was the longest-serving Austro-Hungarian submarine and sank over {{GRT|18,000|first=long}} of ships, including the Italian armored cruiser [[Italian cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi (1899)|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']] in July 1915. ''U-4'' was handed over to France as a [[war reparation]] in 1920 and scrapped.

== Design and construction ==
In 1904, after allowing the navies of other countries to pioneer submarine developments, the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ordered the Austrian Naval Technical Committee (MTK) to produce a submarine design. The January 1905 design developed by the MTK and other designs submitted by the public as part of a design competition were all rejected by the Navy as impracticable. They instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by [[Simon Lake]], [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]], and [[John Philip Holland]] for a competitive evaluation. The two Germaniawerft submarines comprised the ''U-3'' class.&lt;ref name=Con-340&gt;Gardiner, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Lake design became the [[U-1 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-1'' class]] while the Holland design became the [[U-5 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-5'' class]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy authorized two boats, ''U-3'' and ''U-4'', from the Germaniawerft in 1906.&lt;ref name=Gib-384&gt;Gibson and Prendergast, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''U-3''-class was an improved version of Germaniawerft's design for the [[Imperial German Navy]]'s first U-boat, {{SMU|U-1|Germany|2}},&lt;ref name=Gib-384 /&gt; and featured a double [[submarine hull|hull]] with internal [[saddle tank (submarine)|saddle tank]]s. The Germaniawerft engineers refined the design's hull shape through extensive model trials.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; The boats were {{convert|138|ft|9|in|m|0}} long by {{convert|14|ft|m|1}} [[beam (ship)|abeam]] and had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|6|in|m}}. Each boat [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|240|t|ST}} surfaced and {{convert|300|t|ST}} submerged. Each submarine had two bow {{convert|45|cm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} torpedo tubes, and was designed to carry up to three torpedoes.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt;

{{SMU|U-3|Austria-Hungary|2}} and {{SMU|U-4|Austria-Hungary|2}} were both [[keel laying|laid down]] on 12 March 1907 at Germaniawerft in Kiel and were [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in August and November 1908, respectively.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sieche-19&gt;Sieche, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In their book ''The German Submarine War, 1914–1918'', R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast report that both boats were launched in 1909 (p. 384).&lt;/ref&gt; After completion, each was towed to [[Pula|Pola]] via [[Gibraltar]],&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; with ''U-3'' arriving in January 1909 and ''U-4'' arriving in April.&lt;ref name=Sieche-19 /&gt;

== Service career ==
Both boats were [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1909, with ''U-4'' commissioned in August and ''U-3'' in September.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Sieche, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; During the evaluations conducted by the Navy, the ''U-3'' design bested the [[U-1 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-1'']] (Lake) and [[U-5 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-5'']] (Holland) classes in reliability and provided the best living conditions. They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke.&lt;ref name=Con-340 /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The results of the evaluation led the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] to order five new U-boats from Germaniawerft as the {{sclass|U-7|submarine|4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To remedy the diving problems of the ''U-3''-class, the fins were changed in size and shape several times. Eventually the front [[diving plane]]s were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull.&lt;ref name=Con-340 /&gt;

From their commissioning to the outbreak of [[World War I]] 1914, both ''U-3''-class submarines served as training boats and sailed on as many as ten cruises a month in that capacity.&lt;ref name=Sieche-19 /&gt; At the beginning of the war, the ''U-3'' boats made up half of the operational U-boats in the Austro-Hungarian Navy fleet.&lt;ref name=Con-341&gt;Gardiner, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; The armament of each boat was supplemented by the addition of a {{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} [[quick-firing gun|quick firing]] (QF) [[deck gun]]. Both boats conducted reconnaissance cruises for a large part of the first year of the war.&lt;ref name=Sieche-19 /&gt; In August 1915, ''U-3'' was sunk by a French [[destroyer]] after making an unsuccessful torpedo attack on an Italian [[armed merchant cruiser]].&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gib-73&gt;Gibson and Prendergast, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-4'' went on to become the longest serving Austro-Hungarian submarine,&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; sinking twelve ships that totaled over {{GRT|18,000|first=long}} and damaging a British [[Royal Navy]] cruiser.&lt;ref name=KUK-U-4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dublin&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Dublin | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/1730.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I |accessdate= 14 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''

SM ''U-3'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 12 March 1907 at [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] in [[Kiel]] (work no. 135)&lt;ref name=Sieche-19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BS&gt;Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted [http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ahsubs.htm here] (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche). Retrieved 14 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and launched on 20 August 1908.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; Upon completion, she was towed via [[Gibraltar]] to [[Pula|Pola]], where she arrived on 24 January 1909. She was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] on 12 September, and served as a training vessel through the beginning of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Sieche-19 /&gt; For most of the first year of the war, she conducted reconnaissance cruises from [[Cattaro]]. On 12 August 1915, ''U-3'' made an unsuccessful torpedo attack on the Italian [[armed merchant cruiser]] {{SS|Citta di Catania||2}} in the northern end of the [[Strait of Otranto]] and was rammed and damaged by the Italian ship in return. ''U-3'' succumbed to gunfire from the French destroyer [[French destroyer Bisson|''Bisson'']] the following day, with the loss of seven crewmen, including ''[[Linienschiffsleutnant]]'' Karl Strnad, her commanding officer; the other fourteen men of the crew were captured.&lt;ref name=nh-net&gt;{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Gordon | title = Austro-Hungarian Navy: Submarines | url = http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyAustrian.htm#ss | work = World War 1 at Sea | date = 15 September 2008|accessdate = 14 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SM ''U-4'' ===
{{main|SM U-4 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-4'' was laid down in March 1907 at Germaniawerft in Kiel (work no. 136)&lt;ref name=Sieche-19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BS /&gt; and launched in November 1908.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; Upon completion, she was towed via Gibraltar to Pola, where she arrived in January 1909. She was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in August, and served as a training vessel through the beginning of World War I.&lt;ref name=Sieche-19 /&gt;

Over the first year of the war, ''U-4'' made several unsuccessful attacks on warships and captured several smaller vessels as [[prize (law)|prize]]s.&lt;ref name=Sieche-19 /&gt; In July 1915, she scored what ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921'' called her greatest success when she torpedoed and sank the Italian armored cruiser {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Giuseppe Garibaldi|1899|2}},&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt; the largest ship hit by ''U-4'' during the war.&lt;ref name=KUK-U-4&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = WWI U-boats: U KUK U4 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=KUK+U4 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | accessdate = 14 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-May 1917, ''U-4'' was a participant in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]] which precipitated the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of Otranto Straits]].&lt;ref name=Gib-254&gt;Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 254–55.&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate action that same month, ''U-4'' sank her second largest ship, the Italian [[troopship]] ''Perseo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Perseo | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/4750.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | accessdate = 17 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She scored her final success in July 1917 with the sinking of a French [[tug]].&lt;ref name=Sieche-19 /&gt; In total, ''U-4'' sank twelve ships totaling {{GRT|18,264|first=long}}.&lt;ref name=KUK-U-4 /&gt; She survived the war as Austria-Hungary's longest serving submarine, was ceded to France as a [[war reparation]], and scrapped in 1920.&lt;ref name=Con-342 /&gt;
