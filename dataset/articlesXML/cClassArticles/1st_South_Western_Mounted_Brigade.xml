The '''1st South Western Mounted Brigade''' was a formation of the [[Territorial Force]] of the [[British Army]], organised in 1908.  By 1915 its regiments had been posted away so it was broken up; it never saw active service as a brigade.  The [[Headquarters#Military|Headquarters]] may have formed the HQ for [[2/1st Southern Mounted Brigade]].  

==Formation==
{{1st South Western Mounted Brigade}}
Under the terms of the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] (7 Edw.7, c.9), the brigade was formed in 1908 as part of the [[Territorial Force]].  It consisted of three [[yeomanry]] regiments, a [[horse artillery]] [[Artillery battery|battery]] and ammunition column, a transport and supply column and a [[field ambulance]].&lt;ref name=Westlake&gt;{{harvnb|Westlake|1992|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry]] was attached for training in peacetime.&lt;ref name=James36/&gt;

As the name suggests, the units were drawn from [[South West England]], predominantly [[Wiltshire]], [[Somerset]], [[Hampshire]] and [[Dorset]].&lt;ref name=Conrad&gt;{{cite web|url = http://marksrussianmilitaryhistory.info/BRIT14.html|title = The British Army, 1914|last1 = Conrad|first1 = Mark|year = 1996|accessdate = 21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
The brigade was mobilised on 4 August 1914 at the outbreak of the [[First World War]].  Initially assigned to the [[Portsmouth]] Defences in August 1914,&lt;ref name=Rinaldi&gt;{{harvnb|Rinaldi|2008|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; the brigade moved to the [[Forest Row]] area of [[Sussex]] in October 1914.&lt;ref name=James36&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, the regiments left the brigade for other formations.
* The [[Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry]] left in September 1914 for the [[2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade]].&lt;ref name=James18&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It ended the war in the [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th Cavalry Division]] in [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=Sumner10&gt;{{harvnb|Sumner|2001|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[North Somerset Yeomanry]] left the brigade in November 1914, joining the [[6th Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|6th Cavalry Brigade]] in France on 13 November 1914.&lt;ref name=James28&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It remained with the 6th Cavalry Brigade until April 1918 when it was broken up, sending a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] to reinforce each of the other regiments in the brigade.&lt;ref name=39Sigs&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=6 October 2012|publisher=MoD|title=A brief history of 39 (Skinners) Signal Regiment|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/A_brief_history_of_39.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry (Prince of Wales's Own Royal Regiment)]] was split up as divisional cavalry in 1915:&lt;ref name=James30&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Regimental HQ and D Squadron joined [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division|38th (Welsh) Division]] at [[Winchester]]
:A Squadron joined [[40th Division (United Kingdom)|40th Division]] at [[Aldershot]]
:B Squadron joined [[41st Division (United Kingdom)|41st Division]] at [[Aldershot]] about November 1915.
:It was later brought back together as a corps cavalry regiment.  It was converted to infantry and absorbed into 6th (Wiltshire Yeomanry) Battalion, [[Wiltshire Regiment]] in September 1917.&lt;ref name=WiltsRegt&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=5 October 2012|publisher=The Wardrobe|title=The (Duke of Edinburgh's) Wiltshire Regiment|url=http://www.thewardrobe.org.uk/research/history-of-regiments/the-duke-of-edinburghs-wiltshire-regiment-1881-1920-the-wiltshire-regiment-duke-of-edinburghs-1920-1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[Hampshire Yeomanry (Carabiniers)]] was split up as divisional cavalry in March 1916:&lt;ref name=James20&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Regimental HQ and B Squadron joined [[60th (2/2nd London) Division]] at [[Warminster]] on 26 April 1916
:A Squadron joined [[58th (2/1st London) Division]] at [[Ipswich]] on 21 March 1916
:C Squadron joined [[61st (2nd South Midland) Division]] at [[Ludgershall, Wiltshire|Ludgershall]] on 18 March 1916.
:It was later brought back together as a corps cavalry regiment.  In September 1917 it was converted to infantry and absorbed into the 15th (Hampshire Yeomanry) Battalion, [[Hampshire Regiment]].&lt;ref name=LLT_HYC&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 October 2012|last=Baker|first=Chris|title=Hampshire Yeomanry|publisher=The Long Long Trail|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/hampshire.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hampshire Royal Horse Artillery]] joined the [[Essex Royal Horse Artillery|Essex]] and [[West Riding Royal Horse Artillery|West Riding RHA]] in [[V Lowland Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (T.F.)]]; it was re-equipped with four [[18 pounder]]s before departing for Egypt in February 1916 where it joined [[52nd (Lowland) Division]].&lt;ref name=Becke113&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1936|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reformed as [[horse artillery]] on 5 July 1917 exchanging its 18 pounders for [[13 pounder]]s and joined the [[Yeomanry Mounted Division]].  It remained with the division when it was restructured and ''indianized''{{efn|British divisions were converted to the [[British Indian Army]] standard whereby brigades only retained one British regiment or battalion and most support units were Indian (artillery excepted).}} as the [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|1st Mounted Division]] (from 24 April 1918) and later renamed as [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th Cavalry Division]] (23 July 1918).&lt;ref name=Perry22&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It served throughout the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] from 1916 to 1918.

By 1915, with its regiments having been posted away, the brigade was dissolved.  The [[Headquarters#Military|headquarters]] staff may have been used to form the [[2/1st Southern Mounted Brigade]].&lt;ref name=James36/&gt;&lt;ref name=James18/&gt;
