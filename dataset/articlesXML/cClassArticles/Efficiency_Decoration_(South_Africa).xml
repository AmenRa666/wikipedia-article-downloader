The '''Efficiency Decoration (South Africa)''', post-nominal letters '''ED''', was instituted in 1930 for award to efficient and thoroughly capable part-time officers in the Citizen Force of the [[Union of South Africa]] after twenty years of service. The decoration superseded the [[Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LGaz1930&quot;&gt;{{londongazette |issue=33653 |startpage=6309 |date=17 October 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Alexander|first = EGM|authorlink = |author2=Barron, GKB |author3=Bateman, AJ |title = South African Orders, Decorations and Medals |publisher = Human and Rousseau Publishers|year = 1986|location = Cape Town|pages = 160|url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-7981-1895-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Union1939&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/militaf/mil39.htm South African Medal Website - Union Defence Forces (1939-52)] (Accessed 3 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PostNominals&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/militaf/sapnls.htm#DEF South African Medal Website - Post-nominal Letters] (Accessed 28 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoration was replaced by the [[John Chard Decoration]] on 6 April 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SADF 1952-1975&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/militaf/mil52.htm South African Medal Website - SA Defence Force : 1952-1975] (Accessed 30 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In 1892, the Volunteer Officers' Decoration was instituted as an award for long and meritorious service by officers of the United Kingdom's [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]]. In 1894, the grant of the decoration was extended to officers of volunteer forces throughout the British Empire by instituting a separate new decoration, the [[Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies]]. This decoration was superseded in 1899 by the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration.&lt;ref name=&quot;LGaz1892&quot;&gt;{{londongazette|issue=26311|startpage=4303|date=29 July 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo491&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayo|first=John Horsley|title=Medals and Decorations of the British Army and Navy, Vol. II, 1897 (No. 222.

==Institution==
The Efficiency Decoration was instituted by Royal Warrant on 23 September 1930 as a long service award for part-time officers of the Territorial Army of the United Kingdom and of the Auxiliary Military Forces of the British Dominions, Colonies and Protectorates and India. In South Africa, the decoration superseded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration.&lt;ref name=&quot;LGaz1930&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Union1939&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fforde&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Fforde |first = JPI|authorlink = |author2=Monick, S|title = A Guide to South African Orders, Decorations and Medals and their Ribbons 1896-1985|publisher = |year = 1986|location = Johannesburg|pages = 40|url = |doi = |id = |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoration bore a subsidiary title, inscribed on the bar-brooch, to denote whether the recipient qualified for its award while serving in the Territorial Army or in one of the other Auxiliary Military Forces of the Empire. The subsidiary title was inscribed on the bar-brooch of the decoration, &quot;TERRITORIAL&quot; in respect of the Territorial Army or the name of the applicable country in respect of other Auxiliary Military Forces. The South African version was unique, being the only one on which the subsidiary title was bilingual.&lt;ref name=&quot;LGaz1930&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Union1939&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fforde&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Regulations&quot;&gt;[http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/warrants/e6nzed-reg.html New Zealand Defence Force - The Efficiency Decoration Regulations] (Accessed 11 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent award for other ranks was the [[Efficiency Medal (South Africa)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Union1939&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackay&quot;&gt;Mackay, J., Mussell, J.W., Editorial Team of Medal News, (2005), ''The Medal Yearbook'', page 236, (Token Publishing Limited)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award criteria==
The decoration could be awarded to part-time officers after twenty years of commissioned service, not necessarily continuous, as an efficient and thoroughly capable officer on the active list of the Citizen Force of the [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|Union Defence Forces]]. Half of the time served in the ranks could be reckoned as qualifying service for the decoration. Service in West Africa, natives of West Africa and periods spent on leave excluded, and war service was reckoned two-fold as qualifying service for the decoration.&lt;ref name=&quot;LGaz1930&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Union1939&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fforde&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Regulations&quot;/&gt;

Recipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters ED. A recipient who had earlier been awarded any Long Service and Good Conduct Medal or the [[Efficiency Medal]], or a clasp to either, for service in the ranks, was not permitted to wear the medal or clasp together with the decoration until the full service periods prescribed for each medal or clasp as well as the decoration had been completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;LGaz1930&quot;/&gt;

The decoration was initially only awarded to Citizen Force officers of the [[South African Army]] and [[South African Air Force]]. On 1 August 1942, when the [[South African Navy]] was established by the consolidation of the Seaward Defence Force and the South African Division of the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] to create the South African Naval Forces, eligibility for the award of the decoration was extended to South African Naval Citizen Force officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil.za/aboutus/history/index.htm |title=History of the SA Navy |publisher=Navy.mil.za |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1949, the required period of qualifying service was reduced to a minimum twelve years of commissioned service. In respect of officers whose service terminated before 3 September 1939, the qualifying period of commissioned service remained twenty years. At the same time, a clasp was instituted which could be awarded upon the completion of each further period of six years of qualifying service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Union1939&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Regulations&quot;/&gt;

==Order of wear==
In the order of wear prescribed by the British [[Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood]], the Efficiency Decoration (South Africa) ranks on par with the [[Efficiency Decoration]] and takes precedence after the [[Ceylon Armed Services Long Service Medal]] and before the [[Territorial Efficiency Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London Gazette&quot;&gt;{{londongazette|issue=56878|supp=y|startpage=3353|date=17 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{main|South African military decorations order of wear#Order of wear}}
With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace the British awards used to date, the older British decorations and medals which were applicable to South Africa continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the [[Victoria Cross]], took precedence after all South African decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date. Of the official British medals which were applicable to South Africans, the Efficiency Decoration (South Africa) takes precedence as shown.&lt;ref name=&quot;London Gazette&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Notice1982&quot;&gt;Government Notice no. 1982 of 1 October 1954 - ''Order of Precedence of Orders, Decorations and Medals'', published in the Government Gazette of 1 October 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette 27376&quot;&gt;Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, {{OCLC|72827981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three versions of the decoration could be awarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Union1939&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Birkenhead&quot;/&gt;
* On the decoration's original King George V version of 1930, the Royal Cypher &quot;GVR&quot;, for &quot;Georgivs V Rex&quot;, and the crown are both encircled by the wreath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;
