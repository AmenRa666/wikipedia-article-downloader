'''Urban Leonard Drew''' (March 21, 1924 – April 3, 2013), known as '''Ben Drew''', was a fighter pilot in the [[United States Army Air Force]] and a flying ace. He was the first and the only allied pilot to shoot down two jet powered [[Me-262]]'s aircraft in a single mission, while flying a propeller-driven P-51 Mustang. He received [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]] for the mission, on 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.127wg.ang.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123362938&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Life==
Drew was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]] in 1924, he was raised along with a younger brother by their schoolteacher mother. His father died when Drew was at the age of 3. He received his education at [[Wayne University]] and the [[University of Michigan]], graduating with a degree in Political Science. Three months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], at the age of eighteen, Drew joined the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and commenced pilot training.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.127wg.ang.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123362938&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.military-art.com/mall/profiles.php?SigID=1201&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military Life==
He enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] on May 14, 1942, and entered the Aviation Cadet Program in October 1942. Drew was commissioned a 2d Lt and awarded his pilot wings in [[Graham Air Base|Marianna Army Field]] on October 1, 1943, and began training as an instructor pilot for the North American [[P-51 Mustang]] at [[Bartow Municipal Airport|Bartow Field]] and then served as a [[P-51 Mustang]] instructor pilot with the [[56th Fighter Squadron]] of the [[54th Fighter Group]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanairmuseum.com/person/214101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.military-art.com/mall/profiles.php?SigID=1201&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:P-51D_Urban_Drew.jpg|thumb|P-51 Mustang 'Detroit Miss']]
He went overseas in May 1944 and was assigned to the [[375th Fighter Squadron]] of the 361st Fighter Group, which was stationed at [[RAF Bottisham]] and later at [[RAF Little Walden]]. During his tour with the “Yellowjackets”, Drew completed 75 missions, rising to command of “A” Flight and the [[375th Fighter Squadron]]. Drew would be officially credited with six aerial victories during his combat tour. &quot;Detroit Miss&quot;, coded E2-D was his personal P-51, during his tour with [[361st Fighter Group]].

He was credited with 6 aerial victories, 1 ground victory, 1 damaged and 1 water kill in which he and his wingman sank and burned largest aircraft in world, the [[Blohm &amp; Voss BV 238|Blohm &amp; Voss BV238-V1]] on 18 September 1944. [[Hitler]] was going to use it to bomb [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanairmuseum.com/person/214101&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 7 Mission===
[[File:Messerschmitt Me 262A at the National Museum of the USAF.jpg|thumb|Messerschmitt Me-262]]
His biggest day was on October 7, 1944, when he shot down 2 Me-262's on a single mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acestory.elknet.pl/drew/drew.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His appeal for the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] was denied, because of the lack of evidence for his kills.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acestory.elknet.pl/drew/drew.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Mission===
After his service in Europe, Drew was transferred to various training bases in the U.S. In 1945 he was assigned to the [[413th Fighter Squadron]] of [[414th Fighter Group]], flying [[P-47 Thunderbolts]] at [[Iwo Jima]] in the [[Bonin Islands]]. After the war Drew helped organize the [[127th Fighter Group]] of [[Michigan Air National Guard]]. He became deputy group commander and later was appointed the first Air Adjutant General of the State of Michigan. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.warbirdsresourcegroup.org/URG/drew.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Life==
After his retirement from military life, Drew established an aviation business in [[United Kingdom]] and [[South Africa]]. 

More than 40 years later, an Air Force clerk noticed Drew's claim for two Me 262 victories on the same mission. She contacted a custodian of German war records, who knew former Luftwaffe pilots whomight be able to shed light on the claim. [[Georg-Peter Eder]] had been set to lead the [[Me 262]]s of [[JG 7]] that day, but when his aircraft had problems taking off the two-ill-fated pilots took off to lead JG 7. 
Eder says he saw a yellow-nosed P-51 dive on the Me 262s and shoot them down. Eder couldn't read &quot;Detroit Miss&quot; on the nose of the P-51 Mustang, but his account was sufficient to confirm Drew's two Me 262 victories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acestory.elknet.pl/drew/drew.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After the total story was confirmed by both the German [[Luftwaffe]] archives and the [[United States Air Force]] archives. The Air Force Board for the Correction of Military Records recommended that  Drew and his wife were flown in an Air Force [[C-141 Starlifter]] from [[Johannesburg, South Africa]] for the ceremony. The [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Verne Orr]] presented the [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]] on May 12, 1983. He is one of the only two airmen to receive Air Force Cross for actions in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.warbirdsresourcegroup.org/URG/drew.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Drew died on April 3, 2013 and is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;https://airforce.togetherweserved.com/usaf/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&amp;type=Person&amp;ID=147463&lt;/ref&gt;
