== 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing and 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Group. ==

These two units do not share a lineage (even by temporary bestowal).  Temporary bestowal is ruled out because both were active simultaneously during WW II.
: The most current designation for the wing is &lt;s&gt;[[26th Network Operations Group]]&lt;/s&gt;[[26th Network Warfare Wing]] --[[User:Lineagegeek|Lineagegeek]] ([[User talk:Lineagegeek|talk]]) 15:30, 11 April 2016 (UTC)
: The most current designation for the group is [[350th Electronic Systems Wing]]]
The article needs to be split.--[[User:Lineagegeek|Lineagegeek]] ([[User talk:Lineagegeek|talk]]) 20:06, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

== Why 3d not 3rd (third)? ==

Well?    [[User:Tabletop|Tabletop]] ([[User talk:Tabletop|talk]]) 08:57, 1 June 2013 (UTC)

: Usage in official USAF documents is '''2d''' and '''3d''' rather than '''2nd''' and '''3rd''' for ordinal designations of units through the level of division [http://www.barksdale.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=16244] unless it is omitted entirely [http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9572]. ('''Third''' for the numbered air force and '''III''' back when there were numbered commands).  This has risen to the level of edit wars elsewhere, and there are a couple of redirects where both endings have been used for a Wikipedia article on a USAF unit.  I wouldn't make an edit to change this alone, but I'd change it along the way if I were editing a section for other reasons.--[[User:Lineagegeek|Lineagegeek]] ([[User talk:Lineagegeek|talk]]) 19:22, 1 June 2013 (UTC)
