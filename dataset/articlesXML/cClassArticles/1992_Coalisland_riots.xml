The '''1992 Coalisland riots''' were a series of clashes on 12 and 17 May 1992 between local [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] civilians and [[British Army]] soldiers (of the [[3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment|Third Battalion of the Parachute Regiment]]&lt;ref name=ecn&gt;[[The economist]], Volume 323, Issues 7761-4&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]]) in the town of [[Coalisland]], [[County Tyrone]], Northern Ireland. The Third Battalion 1992 tour's codename was &quot;'''Operation Gypsy'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/infantry/parachute-regiment-2/parachute-regiment-3rd-bn.html British Army 1945 on locations and dates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisional IRA attack==
On 12 May 1992, a unit of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) [[Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade|East Tyrone Brigade]] launched a bomb attack on a British Army patrol near the republican stronghold of [[Cappagh, County Tyrone|Cappagh]], County Tyrone. One soldier of the Parachute Regiment, Alistair Hogdson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/paratrooper-who-lost-legs-is-british-191964 Alistair Hogdson profile], mirror.co.uk; accessed 3 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cumbria/8458700.stm Cumbrian amputee claims skydiving honour] BBC News, 14 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, David (1998). ''Paras: an illustrated history of Britain's airborne forces''. Sutton, p. 197; ISBN 0750917237&lt;/ref&gt; lost both legs as a result. The landmine was described in an IRA statement as an &quot;anti-personnel device&quot;.&lt;ref name=may&gt;[http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37019&amp;Itemid=18 &quot;New Paratroop controversy&quot;], emigrant.ie, 18 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident triggered a rampage by members of the Parachute Regiment in the nearby, overwhelmingly [[Irish nationalist]] town of [[Coalisland]], some ten miles to the east.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;British troops launch charm attack in Belfast&quot;, by Peter Millership, [[Reuters]], 8 August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bound/&gt; The IRA attack was described as a &quot;provocation&quot; tactic, devised to produce an over-reaction by troops to make them even more unpopular among local nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, C.J.M. (1998). ''Terrorists' Target Selection''. Palgrave Macmillan, p. 41; ISBN 0-312-21197-X&lt;/ref&gt;

The deployment of the paratroopers, which began in April&lt;ref name=ecn/&gt;&lt;ref name=usa/&gt; had already been criticised by republican activist and former Member of Parliament [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey]], who denounced beatings, shootings and damages to property reportedly carried out by the troops.&lt;ref name=green&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/3539 &quot;British army terrorises Irish town&quot;], Greenleft.org, 1 July 1992.&lt;!--very POV source so text should be reworded for NPOV--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These previous incidents included the destruction of fishing boats and equipments &lt;!-- what are &quot;equipments&quot;? --&gt;in the townland of Kinturk, near [[Ardboe]].&lt;ref name=green/&gt; [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] politician and [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] officer [[Ken Maginnis, Baron Maginnis of Drumglass|Ken Maginnis]], then-[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] for the area, called for the withdrawal of the regiment after receiving a large number of complaints about their behaviour.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline (1997). ''The origins of the present troubles in Northern Ireland''. Longman, pg. 164; ISBN 0-582-10073-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==The confrontation==

===12 May===
Two hours after the IRA attack, members of the regiment sealed off the town of Coalisland, ten miles east of Cappagh. According to a [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] politician,&lt;!--no name provided by cited source--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;may&quot;/&gt; the soldiers fabricated a bogus bomb warning, while the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) stated that the operation began when a joint police/military patrol was stoned by a crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;may&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=woods&gt;Wood, Ian S. (1994). ''Scotland and Ulster''. Mercat Press, p. 161; ISBN 1-873644-19-1&lt;/ref&gt; Two pubs were ransacked by the troops&lt;ref name=cain&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch92.htm#May CAIN −1992 chronology]&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of civilian cars were damaged. Several people were allegedly hit with sticks. Following this, a lieutenant was suspended from duty&lt;ref name=may/&gt; and the regiment was removed from patrol duties in Coalisland.&lt;ref name=fort/&gt;

===17 May===
On the evening of 17 May, a fist-fight began at Lineside Road, where a group of young men were having a drink. A passing four-man patrol of the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] (KOSB) regiment was challenged to a 'boxing match' by the residents.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; The soldiers set aside their weapons and engaged the youths. Injuries were reported on both sides, none critical. The official claim was that the patrol was attacked by a mob&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; of at least 30 people.&lt;ref&gt;Alsing-Børgesen, Kai (1993). ''The Lift: Basisbog for Hf Og Gymnasiet''. Gyldendal Uddannelse, p. 134; ISBN 8700106984&lt;/ref&gt; In the melée, a rifle and a [[GPMG|light machine gun]] were stolen. The rifle was later recovered nearby.&lt;ref name=fort&gt;''Fortnight'' issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, p. 6&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The youths smashed a [[Clansman|backpack radio]] which had been left behind by the troops.&lt;ref name=rib&gt;McAliskey, Bernardette (1992). ''The Moral of Coalisland''. Spare Rib (issues 231–39), p. 47&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Two KOSB soldiers were hospitalised.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;

The Parachute Regiment was called to the scene again, and at 8:30 PM, a major riot started outside The Rossmore pub&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; between local people and about 20 to 25 paratroopers.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; The soldiers claimed one of their colleagues was isolated and dragged by the crowd. Some witnesses claimed paratroopers were in a frenzy, showing their guns and inviting civilians to try to take them. Suddenly, shots were fired by the troops —first into the air and then towards the people outside the pub. Three civilians were rushed to hospital in [[Dungannon]] with gunshot wounds, while the soldiers returned to their barracks.&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; Another four civilians suffered minor injuries.&lt;ref name=cain/&gt; One of the wounded was the brother of IRA volunteer Kevin O'Donnell, who had been killed by the [[Special Air Service]] in February during an [[Clonoe ambush|ambush at the nearby hamlet of Clonoe]], shortly after carrying out a machine-gun attack on the local RUC base.&lt;ref name=rib/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Coalisland - geograph.org.uk - 275069.jpg|thumb|220px|One of the roads to Coalisland centre, which was blocked by British paratroopers on 12 May 1992]]
About 500 people attended a protest rally in Coalisland on 19 May, and the wisdom of deploying the troops to patrol the town was questioned by members of the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] in Dublin. The  [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[David Andrews (Irish politician)|David Andrews]], asked the British Government to withdraw the regiment. As a result, the paratroopers were redeployed outside the urban areas.&lt;ref name=may2&gt;[http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37020&amp;Itemid=18 ''The Irish Emigrant''], &quot;Paratroopers remain in North&quot;. Issue No. 277, 25 May 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=su/&gt; The RUC claimed that the stolen machine gun was found 11 days later at Cappagh, along with another light machine gun and an [[AK-47]] rifle.&lt;ref&gt;''Fortnight'', issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans questioned whether the weapon had really been stolen, suggesting this was merely an excuse for the soldiers' rampage in Coalisland.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;&lt;ref name=rib/&gt; British officials accused [[Sinn Féin]] of being the instigators of the riots,&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; while [[Michael Mates]], then [[Minister of State]] at the [[Northern Ireland Office]], stated that the incidents were due to &quot;a gang of thugs motivated by the IRA&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1992-05-21/Orals-1.html House of Commons, Thursday, 21 May 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the battalion's 1992 tour in Northern Ireland was scaled down, with the patrols suspended before the official end of the deployment. The Third Brigade's commander, Brigadier Tom Longland&lt;ref name=usa&gt;Irish America (1992), Irish Voice, Inc., volume 8&lt;/ref&gt; was replaced by Brigadier Jim Dutton.&lt;ref name=cain/&gt;&lt;ref name=su&gt;Wood, Ian S.

The last patrol took place on 27 June, when two paratroopers drowned while crossing the [[River Blackwater, Ulster|River Blackwater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operationbanner.com/roh/default.asp?MonthAsNumber=6 Operation Banner Deaths: Roll of Honour], operationbanner.com; accessed 17 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fortnight, issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, there were further clashes with local residents, this time in the town of [[Cookstown]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1992.html CAIN – Listing of Programmes for the Year: 1992 – [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] news, 27 June 1992], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 17 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six soldiers faced criminal charges for their roles in the May riots,&lt;ref name=cain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/ulster-soldiers-to-face-charges-1554277.html The Independent], 29 September 1992&lt;/ref&gt; but were acquitted one year later.

Dungannon priest Father [[Denis Faul]] was of the opinion that the soldiers should have been charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=bound&gt;[[David McKittrick|McKittrick, David]].
