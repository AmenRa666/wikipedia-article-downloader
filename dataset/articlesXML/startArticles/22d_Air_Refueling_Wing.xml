The '''22d Air Refueling Wing (22 ARW)''' is a [[United States Air Force]] unit assigned to the [[Air Mobility Command]]'s [[Eighteenth Air Force]]. It is stationed at [[McConnell Air Force Base]], Kansas and also functions as the host wing for McConnell.

Its primary mission is to provide global reach by conducting air refueling and airlift where and when needed. It is one of only three &quot;supertanker&quot; wings in the Air Force, with four Regular Air Force air refueling squadrons, and 63 [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135R Stratotanker]] aircraft.

Its origins date to 1940 as the '''22d Bombardment Group'''.  The group was one of the first [[United States Army Air Forces]] units to be deployed into the Pacific Theater after the [[Pearl Harbor Attack]] with the Martin [[B-26 Marauder]] medium bomber.  The [[22d Operations Group]] carries the lineage and history of its highly decorated World War II predecessor unit.  Active for over 60 years, the 22 ARW and its earlier designation as the 22d Bombardment Wing, was a component wing of [[Strategic Air Command]]'s deterrent force during the [[Cold War]].

The 22d Air Refueling Wing is commanded by [http://www.mcconnell.af.mil/library/biographies/bio.asp?id=16817 Colonel Joel D. Jackson].  Its Command Chief Master Sergeant is [http://www.mcconnell.af.mil/library/biographies/bio.asp?id=13637 Chief Master Sergeant Kaleth O. Wright].

==Mission==

==History==
: ''For additional history and lineage, see [[22d Operations Group]]''
Established as '''22d Bombardment Wing, Medium''', on 28 July 1948. Activated on 1 August 1948.  The new wing was assigned to [[March Air Force Base]], California on 10 May 1949.  It was not operational, so it shared a commander with the 1st Fighter Wing.  The 22d Bomb became operational on 1 July 1949.  The [[1st Fighter Wing]] was attached to it and both wings shared the same commanding officer.

===Korean War===
Detached from the wing, the 22d Bombardment Group deployed its B-29s in early July 1950 to [[Kadena Air Base]], [[Okinawa]], where it came under control of Far Ease Air Forces Bomber Command (Provisional).  On 13 July, the group flew its first mission, against the marshalling yards and oil refinery at [[Wonsan]], [[North Korea]]. By 21 October, it had amassed fifty-seven missions against the enemy, attacking bridges, factories, industrial targets, troop concentrations, airfields, marshalling yards, communications centers, and port facilities. During four months of combat, the group flew 335 [[sortie]]s with only fourteen aborts and dropped over 6,500 tons of bombs. It redeployed to the United States in late October and November 1950.

===Cold War===
Following the return of the Bombardment Group the wing re-equipped the propeller-driven B-29s with new [[B-47E Stratojet]] swept-wing bomber medium bombers in 1953, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. It trained for proficiency in global [[Military strategy|strategic]] bombardment, adding air refueling to its mission in 1952. The wing deployed at [[RAF Mildenhall]], England, September–December 1951, and at [[RAF Upper Heyford]], England, December 1953 – March 1954.  From April to July 1957, it deployed to [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]]. SAC began phasing the B-47 out of the inventory beginning in 1962, sending the last of the wing's aircraft to [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], Arizona in 1963.

The wing was not [[Military tactics|tactically]] operational 11 March 1963 – 15 September 1963, while converting to [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52D]] bombers and [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135A]] tankers.  The wing supported Fifteenth Air Force's post-attack command and control system with EC-135s from, September 1964 – March 1970.

The 22d was a &quot;super&quot; wing from 1966–1971, with two bombardment and two tanker squadrons.  From 10 March to c. 1 October 1967 the wing was reduced to a small &quot;rear-echelon&quot; non-tactical organization with all tactical resources and most support resources loaned to SAC organizations involved in combat operations in [[Southeast Asia]].  In 1971 the Air Force retired all of its B-52C aircraft.  The last airplane of this series was flown from March to [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], Arizona for storage on 29 September 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Knaack, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;  The wing continued to support SAC operations in the [[Far East]] and Southeast Asia through 1975, and from 10 April 1972 to 29 October 1973 again the wing had all its bomber resources loaned to other organizations for combat and contingency operations.  The wing's KC-135 resources were also on loan from 10 April to September 1972; afterwards, a few tankers returned to wing control.

The wing maintained a strategic bombardment alert posture from, 1973–1982, but in 1978 it added [[conventional warfare]] missions, including [[Naval mine|mine-laying]] and sea reconnaissance/surveillance.  For many years, the wing provided the operations staff and support of the [[Tanker Task Force]] (TTF) operations supporting [[Red Flag exercise]] flight operations on the Nellis Ranges, north of Las Vegas, NV, using [[KC-135]] personnel and equipment assets deploying from other bases for the duration of a Red Flag Exercise.  The tanker task force staff TTF at March also supported overseas deployments of [[U.S. Navy]], [[Marine Corps]] and [[USAF]] fighter aircraft going to the Pacific Region using both [[KC-135]] and [[KC-10]] tankers.

In 1982, the wing retired its B-52D aircraft and converted from a bombardment wing (BMW) to an air refueling wing (ARW).  It was the first USAF unit to operate the new [[KC-10 Extender|KC-10A]] along with [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135A]] and [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135E]] aircraft.  From 1982, the wing provided strategic air refueling and [[airlift]] in support of worldwide [[U.S. Air Force]] and other [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] operations and training [[Military exercise|exercises]].  In 1983, the wing moved personnel and cargo in support of [[Chad]]ian resistance to [[Libya]]n incursions and conducted airlift and refueling missions during rescue of U.S. nationals in [[Grenada]].  The wing also provided specialized refueling support to [[SR-71]] aircraft reconnaissance operations using Boeing KC-135Q and (after the [[CFM-56]] conversion) KC-135T aircraft with specialized fuel systems designed to handle the [[JP-7]] fuel, worldwide from 1985 to 1990.

In 1989, the 22 ARW transferred its KC-135E and KC-135Q aircraft and became solely a KC-10 unit.

===Modern era===
The 22 ARW supported [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117]] deployments to [[Saudi Arabia]] and contributed aircraft and personnel to logistics efforts in support of the liberation of [[Kuwait]] from, 1990–1991.

On 1 June 1992, Strategic Air Command was inactivated and the 22d ARW was assigned to the newly established [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC).  From the end of 1992 to 1994, the wing flew [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] airlift missions to [[Somalia]] and it also provided air refueling in support of deployments to [[Haiti]] in 1994.

On 1 January 1994, the wing was reassigned without personnel or equipment from March upon the transfer of March to the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]) to [[McConnell Air Force Base]], Kansas, replacing the inactivating [[384th Bomb Wing]] and assuming control of the 384th's [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135R]] aircraft.  The 22 ARW's former KC-10A aircraft assets were subsequently transferred to the 60th Airlift Wing at [[Travis Air Force Base]], California, that unit being redesignated as the [[60th Air Mobility Wing]] (60 AMW).

Various air refueling squadrons were reassigned to the reconstituted 22 ARW from other units as follows:

* 344 ARS from 68 ARW, [[Seymour Johnson Air Force Base]], North Carolina
* 349 &amp; 350 ARS from 100 ARW, [[Beale Air Force Base]], California
* 384 ARS from inactivated 384 BW, McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas

After the realignment, the 22 ARW deployed crews and aircraft to support no-fly missions over northern and southern [[Iraq]] and over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].  In 1999, wing aircraft and crews deployed to the [[Mediterranean]] to refuel [[NATO]] aircraft over [[Serbia]].  After the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, wing-supplied tanker crews and aircraft air-refueled combat aircraft on missions to the [[Afghanistan]] area.

The wing provided deployed KC-135R support during [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and continues to provide aerial refueling and air mobility support under [[Operation Noble Eagle]] in the United States, [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Iraq War|Operation New Dawn]] overseas, and other AMC, [[USTRANSCOM]], other combatant command, and associated national taskings as required.
