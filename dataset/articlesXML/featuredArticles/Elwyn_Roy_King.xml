'''Elwyn Roy King''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (13 May 1894&amp;nbsp;– 28 November 1941) was a [[flying ace|fighter ace]] in the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC) during World War&amp;nbsp;I. He achieved twenty-six victories in aerial combat, making him the fourth highest-scoring Australian pilot of the war, and second only to [[Harry Cobby]] in the AFC. A civil pilot and engineer between the wars, he served in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) from 1939 until his death.

Born in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], New South Wales, King initially saw service as a [[Australian Light Horse|lighthorseman]] in Egypt in 1916. He transferred to the AFC as a mechanic in January 1917, and was subsequently commissioned as a pilot. Posted to [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron]], he saw action on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] flying [[Sopwith Camel]]s and [[Sopwith Snipe|Snipes]]. He scored seven of his &quot;kills&quot; in the latter type, more than any other pilot. His exploits earned him the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], the [[Distinguished Service Order]], and a [[Mentioned in Despatches|mention in despatches]]. Returning to Australia in 1919, King spent some years in civil aviation before co-founding a successful engineering business. He joined the RAAF following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II and held several training commands, rising to the rank of [[group captain]] shortly before his sudden death in November 1941 at the age of forty-seven.

==Early life==
Roy King was born on 13 May 1894 at The Grove, near [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], New South Wales. He was the son of English-born Elizabeth Mary (Miller) King and Richard King, an Australian labourer. The youth attended public school, and further educated himself in mechanical engineering via correspondence. Having been employed repairing bicycles, automobiles, and farming equipment, he was living in [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]] and working as a motor mechanic when he joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] under the name Roy King on 20&amp;nbsp;July 1915.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |last=Fraser|first=Alan|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/king-elwyn-roy-10741|title=King, Elwyn Roy (1894–1941)|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AIF&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aif.adfa.edu.au/showPerson?pid=165685 |title=Roy King|work= The AIF Project|accessdate=2 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227063228/http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=165685|archivedate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==

===Early service===
On 5&amp;nbsp;October 1915, King embarked for Egypt aboard HMAT ''Themistocles'', as part of the reinforcements for the [[12th Light Horse Regiment (Australia)|12th Regiment]] of the [[4th Light Horse Brigade]].&lt;ref name=AIF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.awm.gov.au/collection/images/large/RCDIG1066993/RCDIG1066993--154-.JPG|title=Australian Imperial Force&amp;nbsp;– Nominal Roll|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate= 4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the 12th Light Horse at [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]] in February 1916, as the unit was reassembling following its service in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=12LHR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10571.asp|title= 12th Light Horse Regiment|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regiment was engaged in the defence of the [[Suez Canal]] during May, and subsequently undertook patrols and sorties in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai Desert]].&lt;ref name=12LHR/&gt;

King transferred to the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC) on 13&amp;nbsp;January 1917, and was posted to Britain to join [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron AFC]] (also referred to as No.&amp;nbsp;71 (Australian) Squadron, [[Royal Flying Corps]], by the British) as an air mechanic on 18&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to a training squadron for flying instruction in August.&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt; On 15&amp;nbsp;October, he gained his [[Flying badge|wings]] and officer's commission.&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;&lt;ref name=SundayTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article123230989 |title=Flying Corps return |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sydney, Australia)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Sydney |date=15 June 1919 |accessdate=4 January 2014 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allocated to No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron in November 1917, King was posted to France for active duty on 21&amp;nbsp;March 1918.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt; The same day, the Germans launched [[Operation Michael]], the opening phase of the [[Spring Offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighter ace===
No. 4 Squadron was operating its [[Sopwith Camel]]s in hazardous, low-altitude support of Australian ground troops when King arrived in France, and he had little opportunity for air-to-air combat.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069818--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 234, 239]&lt;/ref&gt; The burly {{convert|6|ft|5|in|cm|adj=on|sing=on}} King—nicknamed &quot;Bo&quot;, &quot;Beau&quot;, or &quot;Bow&quot;—also had problems landing the Camel; crammed into its small cockpit,  his large frame impeded control stick movement.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting rough landings annoyed his commanding officer, [[Major]] Wilfred McCloughry, brother of ace [[Edgar McCloughry]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Fraser|first=Alan|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mccloughry-wilfred-ashton-7316 |title=McCloughry, Wilfred Ashton (1894–1943)|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; King's friend and fellow No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron pilot, [[Harry Cobby]], recalled that &quot;there was some speculation that he might go home—but he proved himself an impressive pilot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; Cobby often took King on &quot;special missions&quot; to make mischief with the Germans; No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron found that two-man patrols were generally able to lure enemy aircraft into a fight, whereas larger formations tended to deter engagements.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 267, 281&lt;/ref&gt; On 14&amp;nbsp;May 1918, King shot down a two-seat German scout that was spotting for artillery between [[Ypres]] and [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]], but clouds prevented him from confirming its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069821--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 281–282]&lt;/ref&gt; By 20&amp;nbsp;May, he had been credited with his first aerial victory, over a [[Pfalz D.III|Pfalz&amp;nbsp;D.III]] near [[Kemmelberg|Kemmel]]–[[Neuve-Église|Neuve Église]].&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt; He was promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 1&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes/&gt; On 20&amp;nbsp;June, he destroyed a German balloon over [[Estaires]]; although vulnerable to attack with [[Incendiary device|incendiary bullets]], these large observation platforms were generally well protected by fighters and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]], and were thus considered a dangerous but valuable target.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069821--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 284, 288]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month he shot down two more aircraft, a Pfalz and a two-seat [[LVG]], in the [[Leie|Lys]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069821--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 289–290]&lt;/ref&gt;

King registered his fifth victory, an LVG, after raiding [[Armentières]] on 25&amp;nbsp;July 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070031--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 298]&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he led a flight of six Camels from No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron escorting [[Airco DH.9]] light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] in another raid on Armentières. In an action that the [[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918|Australian official history]] highlighted as an &quot;example of cool and skilful air fighting&quot;, the DH.9s completed their bombing mission while the Camels drove off an attacking force of at least ten German [[Fokker]]s, three of the Australians including King claiming victories, without any Allied losses.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070031--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 303]&lt;/ref&gt; He destroyed a German two-seater on 3&amp;nbsp;August and another the following day, sharing the second with [[Herbert Gilles Watson|Herbert Watson]].&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069824--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 338]&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron was heavily engaged in the Allies' [[Hundred Days Offensive|great offensive]] on the Western Front,  launched with the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] on 8&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref name=4Sqn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; King was credited with two victories—a balloon and an LVG—near Estaires during a bombing raid on 10&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069824--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 340–341]&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 and 13&amp;nbsp;August, the Camels of No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron operated in a massed formation over [[Flanders]] with the [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5s]] of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron AFC]], the former's two flights led by Cobby and King, and the latter's by [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] and [[Roy Phillipps]]. Pickings were scarce and No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron's only success came on the second day when King and his flight collectively destroyed a two-seat [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]].&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069822--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 313]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16&amp;nbsp;August 1918, King participated in a major assault against the German airfield at [[Haubourdin]], near [[Lille]], that resulted in thirty-seven enemy aircraft being destroyed on the ground. During the action, described by the official history as a &quot;riot of destruction&quot;, King set on fire a hangar housing four or five German planes.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069824--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 346–349]&lt;/ref&gt; He also, according to No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron pilot Charles Copp, flew down Haubourdin's main street, waving as he went, his reason being that &quot;the girls in that village must have had a heck of a time with all that bombing and must have been terribly scared so I thought I'd cheer them up a bit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the Lille sector was largely clear of German fighters. The official history recorded that on 25&amp;nbsp;August, &quot;King went out alone as far as [[Don, Nord|Don]] railway station, bombed it, machine-gunned a train, and returned among the low clouds—all without seeing any enemy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069824--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 350]&lt;/ref&gt;  The only contact around this time was on 30&amp;nbsp;August, when King, [[Thomas Baker (aviator)|Thomas Baker]] and another pilot shot down two [[Deutsche Flugzeug-Werke|DFWs]] near [[Laventie]].&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069824--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 351]&lt;/ref&gt;   On 1&amp;nbsp;September, King destroyed an observation balloon over [[Aubers Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069825--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 353]&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later he shot down an LVG after attacking a train near Lille with Cobby.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069825--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 356]&lt;/ref&gt; He was recommended for the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) on 8&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1068780--29-.PDF |title=Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award, promulgated in ''[[The London Gazette]]'' on 3&amp;nbsp;December, cited his &quot;gallant and valuable service in bombing and attacking with machine gun fire enemy billets, trains, troops etc&quot;, during which &quot;he ensure[d] success by descending to low altitudes, disregarding personal danger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=31046|startpage=14323|date=3 December 1918|accessdate=on 26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16&amp;nbsp;September, following a lull in aerial combat in the region, King destroyed a Fokker biplane over Lille.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069825--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 359]&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he was promoted to [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] and [[Flight commander (position)|flight commander]].&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt; He took over &quot;A&quot; Flight from Cobby, who had been posted to England.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards, ''Australian Airmen'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of September, King's tally was eighteen. He registered his final victory in a Camel on 2&amp;nbsp;October, when he used bombs to send down his fourth balloon.&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;

[[File:P00826.128Snipe1918.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Sopwith Snipe of No. 4 Squadron, c. 1918.

During October 1918, King converted with the rest of No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron to the upgraded [[Sopwith Snipe]], whose larger cockpit was a better fit for him.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=4Sqn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10842.asp |title=4 Squadron AFC|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored with the Snipe on both 28 and 29&amp;nbsp;October, the latter over [[Tournai]], in what is frequently described as &quot;one of the greatest air battles of the war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers&gt;Odgers, ''Air Force Australia'', pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack pp.376–379&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069826--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 376–379]&lt;/ref&gt; At Tournai, amid a confrontation involving over seventy-five Allied and German fighters, King evaded five enemy Fokkers that dived on him, before destroying an LVG in a head-on attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack pp.376–379&quot;/&gt; The next day, he downed three [[Fokker D.VII]]s, two without firing a shot. As he zoomed up from shooting one out of control, he cut off another. This second Fokker pulled up to avoid collision and toppled onto a third Fokker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack pp.376–379&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 321–322&lt;/ref&gt; One of the war's last air battles took place near [[Leuze, Aisne|Leuze]] on 4&amp;nbsp;November. King's destruction of two D.VIIs in the space of five minutes, the latter in flames, capped his combat career.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069826--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 381]&lt;/ref&gt; His tally of seven victories with the Snipe in the closing days of the war made him the highest-scoring pilot in this type.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shores, ''British and Empire Aces'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

King's final wartime score of twenty-six included six aircraft driven down out of control, thirteen aircraft and four balloons destroyed, and three other aircraft destroyed in victories shared with other airmen.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shores et al., ''Above the Trenches'', p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; This made him second only to Harry Cobby as the most successful ace in the AFC, as well as the fourth most successful of all the Australian aces in the war (his top-scoring compatriots, [[Robert A. Little|Robert Little]] and [[Roderic Dallas|Roderic (Stan) Dallas]], flew with the British [[Royal Naval Air Service]] and Royal Air Force).&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; King was recommended for a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his DFC, which was upgraded to the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and awarded on 3&amp;nbsp;June 1919. The recommendation noted his victories in the air and described him as having &quot;proved himself a very brilliant patrol leader&quot; and as &quot;a magnificent example at all times to all pilots in the Squadron by his keenness on the ground and gallantry in the air which was of the highest possible order&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=31378|startpage=7030|date=3 June 1919|accessdate=on 26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/2/120/0012.pdf |title=Recommendation: Bar to Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=2 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010051547/http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm28/2/awm28-2-120-0012.pdf|archivedate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also belatedly [[mentioned in despatches]] in July 1919 for his wartime service.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;
