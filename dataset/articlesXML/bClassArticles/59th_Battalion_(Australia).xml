The '''59th Battalion''' was an [[infantry]] [[battalion]] of the [[Australian Army]]. Initially raised for service during [[World War I]], the battalion fought on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]] and [[Belgium]] between 1916 and 1918, before being disbanded in 1919. In 1921, it was re-raised as a part-time unit of the [[Citizens Military Force|Militia]] in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. They remained in existence until 1942 when, due to a manpower shortage in the Australian economy, the decision was made to amalgamate the battalion with the [[58th Battalion (Australia)|58th Battalion]] to form the [[58th/59th Battalion (Australia)|58th/59th Battalion]]. Together they remained linked throughout [[World War II]], serving in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] and [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]]. In 1952, the 59th Battalion was re-raised and subsequently was absorbed into the [[Royal Victoria Regiment]] in 1960.

==History==

===World War I===
The 59th Battalion was originally raised as a unit of the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) in [[Egypt]] on 21 February 1916 for service in [[World War I]] as part of an expansion of the AIF that took place following the end of the [[Gallipoli campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Grey 2008, pp. 99&amp;ndash;100.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion was formed through the joining of half of the members of the [[7th Battalion (Australia)|7th Battalion]] with fresh recruits raised in Australia from rural Victoria. Together with the [[57th Battalion (Australia)|57th]], [[58th Battalion (Australia)|58th]] and [[60th Battalion (Australia)|60th]] Battalions, the 59th formed part of the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th Brigade]], attached to the [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Australian Division]].&lt;ref name=AWM1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11246.asp|title=59th Battalion |work=First World War, 1914&amp;ndash;1918 units |publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100124190014/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11246.asp| archivedate= 24 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Joseph Scanlan.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant Colonel John Scanlan, who commanded the 59th Battalion during World War I]]

After completing its formation, the 5th Division was transferred to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Arriving in France on 23 June, the battalion experienced its first taste of fighting on the Western Front in July when it was involved in the [[Battle of Fromelles]], suffering heavy casualties to machine gun fire when it attacked in the first wave. During early 1917, in an effort to shorten their lines of communication, the Germans withdrew to prepared positions of the [[Hindenburg Line]]; a brief advance followed as the Allies followed them up. During this phase of the war the 59th Battalion was not committed to any major attacks, but it did play a defensive role at the end of the [[Second Battle of Bullecourt]] in May, holding the ground that the Australians had gained earlier in the fighting. Later in the year, the Australians were transferred to Belgium where, in late September, the 59th took part in the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]].&lt;ref name=AWM1/&gt;

The following year, the collapse of Tsarist Russia allowed the Germans to launch a large-scale offensive on the Western Front known as the [[Spring Offensive]], which initially forced the Allies back towards Paris. In late March, the Australian divisions were moved south to help shore up the line,&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 5th Division took up a position around Corbie. In the fighting that followed, the 59th Battalion took part in a counter-attack at [[Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux|Villers-Bretonneux]] on 25 April 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; After the German offensive was halted, a brief period of lull followed during which the Allies sought to regain the initiative, and in early July, the 59th took part in a diversionary attack on the Ancre River during the [[Battle of Hamel]].&lt;ref&gt;Laffin 1999, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, the Allies launched their own offensive, the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], and the battalion took part in the fighting at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]] on 8 August. A series of advances followed, resulting in further battles: the [[Battle of Mont St. Quentin|Battle of Mont St Quentin and Péronne]] on 31 August and lastly the [[Battle of St. Quentin Canal]] on 29 September. In early October, the battalion was withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation, having suffered heavily during the earlier fighting. They remained out of the line until the war ended and subsequently the battalion saw no further action, and it was disbanded on 24 March 1919.&lt;ref name=AWM1 /&gt;

During its war service, the 59th lost 795 men killed and 1,619 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two [[Distinguished Service Order]]s with one [[Medal bar|bar]], 17 [[Military Cross]]es, 14 [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]]s with one bar, 51 [[Military Medal]]s with four bars, eight [[Meritorious Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Meritorious Service Medal]]s, 24 [[Mention in Despatches|Mentions in Despatches]], and eight foreign awards.&lt;ref name=AWM1/&gt; A total of 16 [[battle honour]]s were awarded to the 59th Battalion in 1927.&lt;ref name=Festberg115/&gt;

===Inter-war years and later===
After the AIF was demobilised in 1921, Australia's part-time military force, the [[Citizens Military Force|Citizen Force]], was reorganised to replicate the formations of the AIF. As a result, the previously existing Citizen Force infantry regiments were redesignated to perpetuate the numbers of the AIF battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw 2010, pp. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the 59th Battalion was raised again, drawing personnel mainly from the 2nd and 5th Battalions of the 59th Infantry Regiment, as well as part of the 60th Infantry and 29th Light Horse.&lt;ref name=Festberg115&gt;Festberg 1972, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; When territorial designations were adopted in 1927, the battalion became known as the &quot;59th Battalion (The Coburg-Brunswick Regiment)&quot;;&lt;ref name=AWM2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11335.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007134143/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11335.asp|title=58th/59th Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939&amp;ndash;1945 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 January 2010|archivedate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; its motto &amp;ndash; ''Fidelis Et Audax'' &amp;ndash; was also approved at this time.&lt;ref name=Festberg116&gt;Festberg 1972, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon re-formation, the 59th was once again assigned to the 15th Brigade, which was then under the command of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo 2001, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of numbers and funding following the [[Great Depression]] and the suspension of the [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory training scheme]], the battalion's authorised strength was greatly reduced during the inter-war years and it suffered from a lack of recruits and training opportunities during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Keogh 1965, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo 2002, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; An alliance with the [[East Lancashire Regiment]] began in 1926.&lt;ref name=Festberg116/&gt;

In 1939, the battalion underwent a name change, adopting the territorial title of the &quot;Hume Regiment&quot;, when its recruitment territory was re-adjusted with the 59th Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Kuring 2004, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1938 to 1940, the 59th was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Purnell Hill.&lt;ref name=orders1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=6823&amp;Tab=App&amp;Titl=59%20Infantry%20Battalion |title=59th Battalion: Appointments |publisher=Orders of Battle.com |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Whalley took over the role of commander, filling the post until 1942. On 27 August 1942, as a result of a governmental decision to reduce the size of the Militia and return some of its personnel to civilian industry, the 59th Battalion amalgamated with the 58th Battalion becoming the 58th/59th Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews 1961, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The 58/59th Battalion would go on to see action in [[World War II]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South-West Pacific]] during the [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] and [[Bougainville campaign]]s in 1943–45. It was disbanded on 23 February 1946.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt;

Following the end of the war, Australia's part-time military force was re-raised in 1948 under the guise of the Citizens Military Force. The 59th Battalion was not re-formed at this time, however. In 1952,&lt;ref name=rvrhistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/8_7RVR/History.asp |title=History&amp;nbsp;– 8/7 Royal Victoria Regiment |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the battalion was raised again as the &quot;59th Battalion (Hume Regiment)&quot; and assigned to the [[6th Brigade (Australia)|6th Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo 2002, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Marine Artillery'' was approved as the regimental march in 1953.&lt;ref name=Festberg116/&gt; On 23 March 1958, the battalion became the first infantry battalion in Australia to be granted the Freedom of Entry to a city when it was afforded the honour by the city of [[Shepparton, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=rvrhistory/&gt; After the [[Pentropic organisation|Pentropic]] re-organisation of the Australian Army in 1960, the battalion was absorbed into the 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Victoria Regiment]], forming a company-sized element of that unit.&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo 2002, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, even though it was no longer on the Army's order of battle, the 59th was awarded 12 battle honours, which it bore for the 58th/59th Battalion.&lt;ref name=Festberg115/&gt; Later, 2 RVR was redesignated as the [[8th/7th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment]], and this unit now maintains the honours and traditions of the 59th Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw 2010, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=8-7RVR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/8_7RVR/History.asp |title=History&amp;nbsp;– 8/7 Royal Victoria Regiment |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=8 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706121455/http://www.army.gov.au/8_7rvr/History.asp |archivedate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian novelist [[David Denholm]], who wrote about World War II, served with the 58th/59th Battalion in New Guinea and on Bougainville.&lt;ref name=Boadle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boadle|first1=Don|title=David Denholm|url=http://www.csu.edu.au/research/archives/collection/regional/agencies/denholm|website=CSU.edu.au|publisher=Charles Sturt University|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
