[[Vice Admiral]] '''Sir Henry Mackay Burrell''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|KBE,|CB|size=100%}} (13&amp;nbsp;August 1904&amp;nbsp;– 9&amp;nbsp;February 1988) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). He served as [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of the Naval Staff]] (CNS) from 1959 to 1962. Born in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], Burrell entered the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]] in 1918 as a thirteen-year-old cadet. His first posting at sea was aboard the cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}}. During the 1920s and 1930s, Burrell served for several years on exchange with the [[Royal Navy]], specialising as a navigator. Following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, he filled a key liaison post with the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], and later saw action as commander of the destroyer {{HMAS|Norman|G49|6}}, earning a [[Mentioned in Despatches|mention in despatches]].

Promoted [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in 1946, Burrell played a major role in the formation of the RAN's [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]], before commanding the flagship {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} in 1948–49. He captained the light aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Vengeance|R71|6}} in 1953–54, and was twice [[Commander Australian Fleet|Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet]], in 1955–56 and 1958. Burrell was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1955 and a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1959. As CNS, he began a major program of acquisitions for the Navy, including new helicopters, [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], submarines and [[guided missile destroyer|guided-missile destroyer]]s. He also acted to reverse a plan by the government of the day to dismantle the Fleet Air Arm. [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Knighted]] in 1960, Burrell retired to his farm near Canberra in 1962 and published his memoirs, ''Mermaids Do Exist'', in 1986. He died two years later, aged eighty-three.

==Early career==
Henry Mackay Burrell was born at [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales|Wentworth Falls]], in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains district]] of [[New South Wales]]. He was the third child and only son of schoolteacher Thomas Burrell and his wife Eliza.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Bateman, &quot;Burrell, Sir Henry Mackay&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MissileAge&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104923964 |title=Missile age &quot;navy architect&quot; retires |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] | location=Canberra |date=21 February 1962 |accessdate=18 December 2013 |page=14 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's father, who had emigrated from England, joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] at the age of fifty-five during World War&amp;nbsp;I, seeing active service in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; His grandfather and great-grandfather had served in the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=MissileAge/&gt; Henry attended [[Parramatta High School]] before entering the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], Jervis Bay, on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;&gt;Cadman, ''Who's Who in Australia 1988'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=N&amp;veteranId=1187636|title= Burrell, Henry Mackay|work= World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate= 31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of thirteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al., ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; A keen sportsman, he competed in [[rugby union]], [[tennis]] and [[Field hockey|hockey]], winning [[Sporting colours|colours]] for hockey. Burrell graduated from the college in 1921 and became a [[midshipman]] the next year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He went to sea first aboard the light cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}} and then the destroyer {{HMAS|Stalwart|H14|6}}. Posted to the United Kingdom for further training in 1924, he served on the light cruiser {{HMS|Caledon|D53|6}} and the battleship {{HMS|Malaya}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/PR85/377/ |title=Burrell, H M (Midshipmen, HMAS Sydney, RAN)|publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate= 31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1925, he was promoted to [[sub-lieutenant]], rising to [[lieutenant]] by July 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[File:073539Devonshire1936-39.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|HMS ''Devonshire'' during the Spanish Civil War]]
After attending a Royal Navy course in 1930, Burrell became a specialist navigator,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; and saw service aboard the minesweeper [[Hunt-class minesweeper (1916)|HMS ''Pangbourne'']], destroyers {{HMAS|Tattoo}} and {{HMAS|Stuart|D00|2}}, and cruiser {{HMAS|Brisbane|1915|6}}. He married Margaret MacKay at [[Scots' Church, Melbourne]], on 27&amp;nbsp;December 1933. Burrell was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]] in July 1934, and graduated from an advanced navigation course the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Burrell served on exchange with the Royal Navy as navigator aboard the cruisers {{HMS|Coventry|D43|6}} and {{HMS|Devonshire|39|6}}, the latter during her tour of duty in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Described as being &quot;egalitarian&quot; and &quot;approachable&quot;, his familiarity with [[Naval rating|ratings]] earned him the criticism of ''Devonshire''{{'}}s captain; Burrell however believed that a close relationship between officers and men was necessary for the smooth running of a ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy in World War II'' , p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  After completing the Royal Navy's staff course in 1938, he returned to Australia and was appointed staff officer (operations) at the Navy Office, Melbourne, in March 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens p. 60&quot;&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gill39-42p56&gt;Gill, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070315--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', p. 56]&lt;/ref&gt; It was Burrell's first shore-based position, and he spent the next four months bringing naval sections of the ''War Book'' (preparations for war) up to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens p. 60&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Burrell was still based at the Navy Office when World War&amp;nbsp;II broke out in September 1939.&lt;ref name=Gill39-42p56/&gt; A reorganisation of the headquarters in May 1940 saw him promoted to [[commander]] and given the new role of Director of Operations, overseeing troop convoys and their air cover, local defence, and staffing issues.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070347--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 418–419]&lt;/ref&gt; Burrell's &quot;full knowledge of Australian naval plans and resources&quot; led to Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] personally nominating him to participate in staff talks with representatives of the Royal Navy and [[United States Navy|US Navy]] in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Soon after, he was posted as the first Australian naval [[Military attaché|attaché]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], in an effort to improve communications with the US in light of the threat from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Burrell was credited with helping to foster closer cooperation between the two navies in the [[Pacific War|Pacific region]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; He also warned the Australian government that Britain and the US would adopt a &quot;Germany-first&quot; strategy in the event of war with Japan, and that the US was prepared to weaken its Pacific fleet to help secure the [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article101975441 |title=RAN loses a distinguished commander |newspaper=The Canberra Times |location=Canberra|date=10 February 1988 |accessdate=18 December 2013 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posted to Britain, Burrell was appointed [[commanding officer]] of the newly commissioned [[J, K and N-class destroyer|N-class]] destroyer {{HMAS|Norman|G49|6}} on 15&amp;nbsp;September 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy, 1942-1945 p. 16&quot;&gt;Gill, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070270--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's first operation was transporting a [[Trade Union Congress]] delegation led by [[Walter Citrine, 1st Baron Citrine|Sir Walter Citrine]] to [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]], Russia.

Later that month, she was reassigned to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean]] and in June was involved in [[Operation Vigorous]], an unsuccessful attempt to resupply the besieged island of [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-norman-i| title=HMAS Norman (I)|publisher=[[Royal Australian Navy]]|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transferred back to the Indian Ocean, Burrell led ''Norman'' in the second campaign of the [[Battle of Madagascar]] in September, and was [[mentioned in despatches]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February 1943 for his &quot;bravery and resource&quot; during the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.awm.gov.au/collection/images/large/RCDIG1068969/RCDIG1068969--389-.JPG |title=Recommendation: Mention in Dispatches|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35915|date=19 February 1943|startpage=935|supp=yes|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time ''Norman'' was escorting convoys in the Pacific, before deploying to the South Atlantic for [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine duties]] in April–May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy 1942-1945 pp. 296-295&quot;&gt;Gill, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070427--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', pp. 296–297]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23&amp;nbsp;June 1943, Burrell relinquished command of ''Norman'' and returned to the Navy Office, Melbourne, as Director of Plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy 1942-1945 pp. 296-295&quot;/&gt; Having been divorced from his first wife Margaret in November 1941, he married [[mineralogist]] Ada Weller (also known as Ada Coggan) on 21&amp;nbsp;April 1944; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt; Burrell took charge of the RAN's latest {{sclass2-|Tribal|destroyer (1936)|0}} destroyer, {{HMAS|Bataan|I91|6}}, at her commissioning in Sydney on 25&amp;nbsp;May 1945. Arriving on the scene too late to see action, the ship was deployed to Japan via the Philippines in July, docking in Tokyo on 31&amp;nbsp;August. There she participated in the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|formal surrender ceremonies]] that took place on 2&amp;nbsp;September aboard {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}. ''Bataan'' remained in Japan as Australian Squadron representative until November, assisting with the repatriation of inmates from Japanese [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;HMAS Bataan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-bataan|title= HMAS Bataan|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a mission to one such camp at [[Sendai]], Burrell located crewmen from the light cruiser {{HMAS|Perth|D29|6}}, which had been sunk in the early hours of 1&amp;nbsp;March 1942 during the [[Battle of Sunda Strait]]; 320 of her complement of 680 survived the sinking, 105 dying in captivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy, 1942-1945&quot;&gt;Gill, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070444--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', pp. 681–682]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070350--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 620–622]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:305416Burrell1954.jpg|right|upright=1.25|thumb|Captain Burrell (right) and crew beside a [[Bristol Sycamore]] helicopter on HMAS ''Vengeance'', c. 1954]]
Burrell's first appointment following the cessation of hostilities was as commander of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; He was promoted [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in June 1946, and became [[Deputy Chief of Navy (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff]] (DCNS) that October. As DCNS, Burrell played a major role in establishing the Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]] and preparing for the introduction of carrier-based aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He was appointed an [[aide-de-camp]] to Governor-General [[William McKell]] in July 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=October 1947| title=The Navy List| location=Melbourne|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1947.pdf|page= 39|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From October 1948 to the end of 1949, Burrell served as commanding officer of the heavy cruiser {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}}, [[flagship]] of the RAN. Posted to Britain in 1950, he attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]], London, and spent two years as Assistant Australian Defence Representative.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt; He took command of the light aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Vengeance|R71|6}} on 2&amp;nbsp;December 1952, less than three weeks after she was commissioned into the RAN after transfer from the Royal Navy. The ship began working up for deployment to the [[Korean War]] in June 1953, but in the end her place was taken by the carrier {{HMAS|Sydney|R17|6}}. ''Vengeance'' was involved in a collision with HMAS ''Bataan'' near the [[Cocos Islands]] on 5&amp;nbsp;April 1954, while acting as part of the escort for the [[Royal Yacht]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] during their inaugural tour of Australia, but continued on duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-vengeance|title= HMAS Vengeance|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completing his tour as captain of ''Vengeance'', Burrell briefly resumed the role of Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff in August 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; The following month he was made an aide-de-camp to the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=January 1955| title=The Navy List| location=Melbourne |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-January-1955.pdf|page= 58|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrell was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1955 [[New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40367|date=31 December 1954|startpage=39|supp=yes|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February he became [[Commander Australian Fleet|Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet]], with the acting rank of [[rear admiral]]; this was made substantive in July.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;May 1956, he hoisted his standard aboard the recently arrived aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}}, marking her replacement of sister ship HMAS ''Sydney'' as flagship of the RAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-melbourne-ii|title=HMAS Melbourne (II)|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrell was posted soon afterwards to the Navy Office, Canberra, to redevelop the service's officer structure, leading to a new ''General List'' of officers' seniority. He served as [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board|Second Naval Member (Personnel)]] from September 1956 until January 1958, when he again became Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1959 New Years Honours,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=41590|date=30 December 1958|startpage=37|supp=yes|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrell was raised to [[vice admiral]] on 24&amp;nbsp;February and became First Naval Member, the [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of the Naval Staff]] (CNS).&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He succeeded Vice Admiral [[Roy Dowling|Sir Roy Dowling]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''The Navy Miscellany'', pp. 515–516&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DDG-38.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|{{HMAS|Perth|D 38|6}}, first of the RAN's guided-missile destroyers ordered by Burrell, at sea in 1980]]
As CNS, Vice Admiral Burrell had to contend with a threat by Defence Minister [[Athol Townley]] to disband the Navy's fixed-wing Fleet Air Arm capability by 1963, but gained approval for a major vessel re-equipment drive that was to include new submarines, destroyers, minesweepers, and [[Auxiliary ship|auxiliaries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens pp. 187-188&quot;&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; This led among other things to the procurement of British {{sclass-|Oberon|submarine}}s, selected by Burrell when his original preference for an Australian-built craft proved too expensive, as well as {{sclass2-|Ton|minesweeper||ship}}s and the Navy's first purpose-designed [[hydrographic survey]] ship, {{HMAS|Moresby|1963|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens pp. 187-188&quot;/&gt; The re-equipment program also resulted in augmentation of the RAN's rotary-wing assets with [[Westland Wessex]] anti-submarine warfare helicopters. Most significant was the purchase of three {{sclass-|Charles F. Adams|destroyer|0}} guided-missile destroyers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; a decision of &quot;ingenuity and forethought&quot; on the part of Burrell and Navy Minister [[John Gorton]], according to historian [[Tom Frame (bishop)|Tom Frame]].&lt;ref&gt;Frame, ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; The CNS and his minister enjoyed a close working relationship; Burrell declared that Gorton &quot;deserves our thanks for his efforts&quot;, and Gorton called Burrell &quot;one of the most honest, sincere and most dedicated sailors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, ''John Gorton'', pp. 90, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The purchase of the destroyers signalled a shift in reliance for equipment from Britain to the United States that was contrary to prevailing Australian defence policy at the time, particularly in what historian [[Jeffrey Grey]] described as &quot;the most British of the Australian services, the RAN&quot;, and provoked pressure from the Royal Navy and UK shipbuilders, which had lobbied for purchase of their {{sclass2-|County|destroyer}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grey, ''Up Top'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Burrell later declared that the superiority of the US weapons system was a key factor in his preference for the ''Adams'' design over the County class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones &amp; Goldrick&quot;&gt;Jones; Goldrick, ''Struggling for a Solution'', pp. 7–12&lt;/ref&gt; On a mission overseas to discuss trends and acquisitions in January 1960, he was rebuffed by Britain's [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], Admiral of the Fleet [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], who mistakenly thought him responsible for the imminent dissolution of the RAN's Fleet Air Arm, but warmly welcomed by the US [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens pp. 187-188&quot;/&gt; As it happened, Burrell would gain credit for maintaining the integrity of the FAA,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; and its fixed-wing component remained viable until the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/history/museums/fleet-air-arm-museum |work=Fleet Air Arm Museum |title=Helos take over (1984) |publisher= Royal Australian Navy|accessdate= 31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]], [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 3&amp;nbsp;June 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=42052|date=3 June 1960|startpage=4009|supp=yes|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1961, he met with his opposite numbers in the [[Reg Pollard (general)|Army]] and [[Valston Hancock|Air Force]] at a Chiefs of Staff Committee conference to discuss the necessity of Australia acquiring nuclear weapons; the chiefs agreed that the probability such a capability would be required was remote but that it should remain an option under certain circumstances, a position the defence forces maintained during the ensuing decade.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrell made his farewell to the Australian Fleet aboard HMAS ''Melbourne'' at Jervis Bay on 8&amp;nbsp;February 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-voyager-ii|title= HMAS Voyager (II) |publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He  left the Navy on 23&amp;nbsp;February, and was succeeded as CNS by Vice Admiral [[Hastings Harrington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/biography/vice-admiral-sir-wilfred-hastings-harrington|title=Vice Admiral Sir Wilfred Hastings Harrington|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrell retired to ''Illogan Park'', his property near [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] in the [[Southern Tablelands]] of New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; His son Stuart followed him into the Royal Australian Naval College in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104258015 |title=Building a family tradition |newspaper=The Canberra Times |location=Canberra |date=2 February 1963 |accessdate=18 December 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In retirement Burrell enjoyed horse racing both as a gambler and as the owner of several successful mounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; During the 1960s, he was also a member of the ACT Regional Selection Committee of the [[Winston Churchill Memorial Trusts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105762078 |title=ANU head is trust choice |newspaper=The Canberra Times |location=Canberra |date=22 July 1965 |accessdate=18 December 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article107058115 |title=Chairman appointed |newspaper=The Canberra Times|location=Canberra|date=18 June 1968 |accessdate=18 December 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrell suffered a serious [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1980, having been diagnosed with cardiac problems shortly after his retirement from the Navy. His wife Ada died in August the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; In 1986, Burrell published his memoirs as ''Mermaids Do Exist: The Autobiography of Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Burrell'', reflecting on what he described as a &quot;lucky&quot; career, and offering his thoughts on maritime strategy.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mermaids&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article119477404 |title=Lessons from a 'lucky' career |newspaper=The Canberra Times |location=Canberra |date=24 January 1987 |accessdate=18 December 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 9&amp;nbsp;February 1988 in [[Canberra Hospital|Woden Valley Hospital]].
