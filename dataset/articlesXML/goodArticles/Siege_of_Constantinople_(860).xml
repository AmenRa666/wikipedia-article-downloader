{{Campaignbox Russo-Byzantine Wars}}

The '''Siege of Constantinople of 860''' was the only major military expedition of the [[Rus' Khaganate]] recorded in [[Byzantine]] and [[Western Europe]]an sources. The cause of the siege was the construction of the fortress [[Sarkel]] by Byzantine engineers, restricting the Russian trade route along the Don River in favor of the [[Khazars]]. Accounts vary regarding the events, with discrepancies between contemporary and later sources. The exact outcome is unknown. 

It is known from Byzantine sources that the Rus' caught [[Constantinople]] unprepared, while the empire was preoccupied by the ongoing [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]] and unable to deal with the Rus' threat. After pillaging the suburbs of the Byzantine capital, the Rus' retreated, although the nature of this withdrawal, and indeed which side was victorious, is subject to debate. The event gave rise to a later [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] tradition, which ascribed the deliverance of Constantinople to a miraculous intervention by the [[Theotokos]].

==Background==
The first mention of the Rus' near the Byzantine Empire comes from ''Life of St. George of Amastris'', a [[hagiographic]] work whose dating is [[Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus'#Date of the Expedition|debated]]. The Byzantines had come into [[Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus|contact with the Rus']] in 839. The exceptional timing of the attack suggests the Rus' had been informed of the city's weakness, demonstrating that the lines of trade and communication did not cease to exist in the 840s and 850s. Nevertheless, the threat from the Rus' in 860 came as a surprise; it was as sudden and unexpected &quot;as a swarm of wasps&quot;, as Photius put it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey&quot;&gt;Turnbull 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; The empire was struggling to repel the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] advance in [[Asia Minor]]. In March 860, the garrison of the key fortress [[Loulon]] unexpectedly surrendered to the Arabs. In April or May, both sides [[Arab–Byzantine prisoner exchanges|exchanged captives]], and the hostilities briefly ceased; however, in the beginning of June, Emperor [[Michael III]] left Constantinople for Asia Minor to invade the Abbasid Caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Siege==
On June 18, 860,&lt;ref&gt;This date, given by the [[Brussels Chronicle]], is nowadays accepted as definitive by historians. In the 12th century [[Primary Chronicle]] of [[Kievan Rus']], the campaign is dated to 866 and associated with the names of the [[Askold and Dir]], believed to be the [[Kiev]]an rulers at the time. However, the dating in the early part of the Primary Chronicle is generally faulty. (Vasiliev 145)&lt;/ref&gt; at sunset, a fleet of about 200 Rus' vessels&lt;ref&gt;Contradicting the Greek sources, [[John, deacon of Venice|John the Deacon]] puts the number of ships at 360. This divergence has led Alexander Vasiliev to argue that John wrote about an entirely different event — a [[Viking]] attack on Constantinople from the south in 861, otherwise not attested by any other source (Vasiliev 25). The Primary Chronicle gives an even more exaggerated number of ships — 2,000. (Logan 188)&lt;/ref&gt; sailed into the [[Bosporus]] and started pillaging the suburbs of Constantinople ([[Old East Slavic]]: ''[[Tsarigrad]]'', [[Old Norse]]: ''[[Names of Istanbul#Old Norse|Miklagarðr]]''). The attackers were setting homes on fire and drowning and stabbing the residents. Unable to do anything to repel the invaders, [[Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]] urged his flock to implore the [[Theotokos]] to save the city.&lt;ref&gt;Logan 190&lt;/ref&gt; Having devastated the suburbs, the Rus' passed into the [[Sea of Marmora]] and fell upon the [[Isles of the Princes]], where the former [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople]] was in exile at the time. The Rus' plundered the dwellings and the monasteries, slaughtering the captives. They took twenty-two of the patriarch's servants aboard ship and cut them into pieces with axes.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 188–189&lt;/ref&gt;


The attack took the Byzantines by surprise, &quot;like a thunderbolt from heaven&quot;, as it was put by Patriarch Photius in his famous oration written on the occasion. Emperor Michael III was absent from the city, as was his navy dreaded for its skill in using [[Greek fire]]. The Imperial army (including those troops that were normally garrisoned closest to the capital) was fighting the Arabs in Asia Minor. The city's land defences were weakened by the absence of these garrisons, but the sea defences were also lacking. The [[Byzantine Navy]] was occupied fighting both Arabs and [[Normans]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. These simultaneous deployments left the coasts and islands of the [[Black Sea]], the [[Bosporus]], and the Sea of Marmara susceptible to attack.

The invasion continued until August 4, when, in another of his sermons, Photius thanked heaven for miraculously relieving the city from such a dire threat. The writings of Photius provide the earliest example of the name &quot;Rus&quot; (''Rhos'', {{lang-el|Ρως}}) being mentioned in a Greek source; previously the dwellers of the lands to the north of the Black Sea were referred to archaically as &quot;Tauroscythians&quot;. The patriarch reported that they had no supreme ruler and lived in some distant northern lands. Photius called them ''έθνος άγνωστον'', &quot;unknown people&quot;, although some historians prefer to translate the phrase as &quot;obscure people&quot;, pointing out the earlier contacts between Byzantines and the Rus'.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later traditions==
[[File:Moscow Kremlin fresco about war in 860.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fresco]] (1644) showing Michael and Photius putting the [[veil]] of the [[Theotokos]] into the sea ([[Church of the Deposition of the Robe|Church of the Veil]], [[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]
The sermons of Photius offer no clue as to the outcome of the invasion or the reasons why the Rus' withdrew to their own country. Later sources attribute their retreat to the Emperor's speedy return to the capital. As the story goes, after Michael and Photius put the veil of the [[Theotokos]] into the sea, there arose a tempest which dispersed the boats of the barbarians. In later centuries, it was said that the Emperor hurried to the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|church at Blachernae]] and had the robe of the Theotokos carried in procession along the [[Theodosian Walls]]. This precious Byzantine relic was dipped symbolically into the sea and a great wind immediately arose and wrecked the Rus' ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey&quot;/&gt; The pious legend was recorded by [[George Hamartolus]], whose manuscript was an important  source for the [[Primary Chronicle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;&gt;For other Byzantine authors who narrate stories about the miraculous saving of Constantinople from the Scythians see: [[Leo Grammaticus]] 240–241; Theodose de Melitene 168; [[Symeon Logothetes]] 674–675&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the Kievan chronicle appended the names of [[Askold and Dir]] to the account as they believed that these two [[Varangians]] had presided over [[Kievan Rus'|Kiev]] in 866. It was to this year that (through some quirk in chronology) they attributed the first Rus' expedition against the Byzantine capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nikon Chronicle&quot;&gt;The number of raids was multiplied in the 16th century Nikon Chronicle, which interpreted the 860 raid (described in Byzantine sources) and the 866 raid (described by the Primary Chronicle) as two distinct events. This obvious blunder led [[Boris Rybakov]] to conclude that the Rus' raided Tsargrad in 860, 866, 874. For a critique, see Tvorogov 54–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vlahernskaya.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Blachernitissa]]: the [[icon]] before which [[Michael III]] may have prayed to the [[Theotokos]] for the deliverance of Constantinople from the Rus'.]]
[[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]]'s account of the first encounter between the Rus' and the Byzantines may have contributed to the popularity of the Theotokos in Russia. The miraculous saving of Constantinople from the barbarian hordes would appear in Russian icon-painting, without understanding that the hordes in question may have issued from [[Kiev]]. Furthermore, when the [[Blachernitissa]] was brought to [[Moscow]] in the 17th century, it was said that it was this icon that had saved Tsargrad from the troops of the &quot;Scythian khagan&quot;, after Michael III had prayed before it to the Theotokos. Nobody noticed that the story had obvious parallels with the sequence of events described by Nestor.

In the 9th century, a legend sprang up to the effect that an ancient column at the Forum of Taurus had an inscription predicting that Constantinople would be conquered by the Rus. This legend, well known in Byzantine literature, was revived by the [[Slavophile]]s in the 19th century, when Russia was on the point of wresting the city from the Ottomans.

==Criticism==
As was demonstrated by Oleg Tvorogov and [[Constantine Zuckerman]], among others, the 9th century and later sources are out of tune with the earliest records of the event. In his August sermon, Photius mentions neither Michael III's return to the capital nor the miracle with the veil (of which the author purportedly was a participant).

On the other hand, [[Pope Nicholas I]], in a letter sent to Michael III on September 28, 865, mentions that the suburbia of the imperial capital were recently raided by the pagans who were allowed to retreat without any punishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Papae epistolae&quot;&gt;Nicolai I 479–480. Analyzed in Vasiliev 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Venetian Chronicle'' of [[John, deacon of Venice|John the Deacon]] reports that the ''Normanorum gentes'', having devastated the ''suburbanum'' of Constantinople, returned to their own lands in triumph (&quot;et sic praedicta gens cum triumpho ad propriam regressa est&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Venetian Chronicle&quot;&gt;Iohannes Diaconus 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that the victory of Michael III over the Rus' was invented by the Byzantine historians in the mid-9th century or later and became generally accepted in the Slavic chronicles influenced by them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zuckerman&quot;&gt;This theory is advanced by Zuckerman, among others (see Zuckerman 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the memory of the successful campaign was transmitted orally among the Kievans and may have dictated Nestor's account of [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]]'s [[Rus'-Byzantine War (907)|907 campaign]], which is not recorded in Byzantine sources at all.

==In popular culture==
The Siege of Constantinople is mentioned in Stephenie Meyer's novel ''[[Breaking Dawn]]'' by the character Kate. In a scene where the immortals share their war stories, Kate implies that she and her sisters aided in the battle and led Oleg to victory.{{cn|date=June 2016}}
