'''Henry Aloysius Petre''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]]  (12&amp;nbsp;June 1884&amp;nbsp;– 24&amp;nbsp;April 1962) was an English [[solicitor]] who became Australia's first military aviator and a founding member of the [[Australian Flying Corps]], predecessor of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. Born in [[Essex]], he forsook his early legal career to pursue an interest in aviation, building his own aeroplane and gaining employment as a designer and pilot. In 1912, he answered the Australian [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Defence Department]]'s call for pilots to form an aviation school, and was commissioned a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Australian Military Forces]]. The following year, he chose the site of the country's first air base at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, and established its inaugural training institution, the [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]], with [[Eric Harrison (RAAF officer)|Eric Harrison]].

Shortly after the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;I, Petre was appointed commander of the [[Mesopotamian Half Flight]], the first unit of the newly formed Australian Flying Corps to see active service. He led the Half Flight through the [[Battle of Es Sinn|Battles of Es Sinn]] and [[Battle of Ctesiphon (1915)|Ctesiphon]], and the [[Siege of Kut]]. His actions in the Middle East earned him the [[Distinguished Service Order]], the [[Military Cross]], and four [[Mentioned in Despatches|mentions in despatches]]. Transferring to the [[Royal Air Force]] as a [[major]] in 1918, he commanded [[No. 75 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron]] before retiring from the military the following year. Petre resumed his legal practice in England, and continued to fly recreationally before his death in 1962, aged seventy-seven. He was married to racing driver [[Kay Petre]].

==Early career==
Born on 12 June 1884 at [[Ingatestone]], [[Essex]], Petre (pronounced &quot;Peter&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', xv&lt;/ref&gt; was the son of Sebastian Henry Petre and his wife Catharine. He was schooled at [[Mount St Mary's College]], [[Chesterfield]], before following his father into law and becoming a [[solicitor]] in 1905.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Garrisson, &quot;Petre, Henry Aloysius (1884–1962)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by [[Louis Blériot]]'s pioneering [[English Channel|cross-channel]] flight in July 1909, Petre gave up his legal practice, borrowed £250 &lt;!--(£23,300 in 2015 prices)--&gt; and proceeded to build his own aeroplane, with design assistance from his brother Edward, an architect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.2-4&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine

He became an instructor at Brooklands' [[Deperdussin|Deperdussin School]], and later its chief, prior to taking up employment as a designer and pilot with [[Handley Page|Handley Page Limited]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt; Characterised by [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|official RAAF historian]] Douglas Gillison as &quot;quiet and academic by nature&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.710-711&quot;/&gt; and coming from a long line of [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|Catholic clergy]], Petre was nicknamed &quot;Peter the Monk&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell-Wright, ''An Interesting Point'', pp. 12, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; On Christmas Eve 1912, Edward Petre, who was known as &quot;Peter the Painter&quot;, was killed in an accident at [[Marske-by-the-Sea]], Yorkshire, while attempting to fly from Brooklands to [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight&quot;/&gt;

In December 1911, the Australian Defence Department had advertised in the United Kingdom for &quot;two competent mechanists and aviators&quot; to establish a flying corps and school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.2-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.710-711&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/33.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp. 710–711]&lt;/ref&gt;  From among fifty applications, Petre was chosen and commissioned as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Australian Military Forces]], his appointment on 6&amp;nbsp;August 1912 making him the nation's first military pilot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.2-4&quot;/&gt; The other appointee, [[Eric Harrison (RAAF officer)|Eric Harrison]], joined him later that year. Petre arrived in Australia in January 1913, his first task being to choose a site for the proposed [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] (CFS), which he was to command. After travelling hundreds of kilometres on his motorcycle, and rejecting the government's preferred location near the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in [[Canberra]], he selected {{convert|297|hectare|acre}} at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, to become, as [[George Odgers]] described it, the &quot;birthplace of Australian military aviation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.2-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt;

Unlike the alternative site near Duntroon, Point Cook was flat, close to the coast and not, in Petre's own words, &quot;isolated in the bush&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He and Harrison established CFS over the following year with four mechanics, three other staff, and five aircraft including two Deperdussin monoplanes, two [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]] biplanes, and a [[Bristol Boxkite]] for initial training. Harrison made the unit's first flight in the Boxkite on Sunday, 1&amp;nbsp;March 1914, while Petre, taking off in a Deperdussin later that day, registered its first accident when he crashed after snaring his tailplane in telephone wires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Force News&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine

[[File:A04131CaudronMesopotamia1916.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Caudron G.3 of the Mesopotamian Half Flight|alt=Front view of single-engined biplane and two men in front of a large open hangar]]
On 8 February 1915, the Australian government received a request from the [[British Raj|British Government of India]] for aerial assistance in the [[Mesopotamian campaign|campaign against the Turks in Mesopotamia]]. Aircrew and supporting personnel for half a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] only were available so the unit, the AFC's first to see active service, became known as the [[Mesopotamian Half Flight]]. Promoted to [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]], Petre was appointed the Half Flight's commanding officer and embarked for [[Basra]] via [[Bombay]] on 14&amp;nbsp;April, later to be joined by fellow pilots White, Merz and Lieutenant William Treloar, along with thirty-seven ground staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack pp.1-3&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/01.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 1–3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 4–9&lt;/ref&gt; In Mesopotamia, Petre was required to lead the AFC contingent in [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] and [[sabotage]] missions, and had to deal with unreliable machines, hazardous terrain, and the threat of incarceration or death at the hands of hostile tribesmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt; He took part in operations in the [[Amarah|Amara]] area from 31&amp;nbsp;May to 4&amp;nbsp;June, for which he was [[mentioned in despatches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29536 |supp=yes|startpage=3661|date=5 April 1916|accessdate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obsolete aircraft supplied by the Indian Government, two [[Maurice Farman Shorthorn]]s and a [[Maurice Farman Longhorn]], were only capable of top speeds of 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h), while the desert wind (known as the ''[[shamal (wind)|shamal]]'') could reach 80&amp;nbsp;mph (129&amp;nbsp;km/h), meaning that the aircraft often made no headway or were simply blown backwards. In July, the Half Flight's equipment was augmented by two [[Caudron G.3]] aircraft, a marginal improvement on the Farmans, but still prone to mechanical failure. Later that month, one of the Caudrons was forced to land in enemy territory. Its crew, Merz and a New Zealander, were never seen again; they were later reported killed by Arabs after a running gun battle over several miles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.5-8&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 5–8&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August, the Half Flight was augmented by four [[Martinsyde]] S1s and redesignated [[No. 30 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30 Squadron]], [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC). The squadron moved into [[Kut]] following the city's capture by the Allies during the [[Battle of Es Sinn]] in September;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack pp.11-13&quot;&gt;Cutlack, ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; for his part in the operation, Petre was again mentioned in despatches.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29536 |supp=yes|startpage=3665|endpage=3666|date=5 April 1916|accessdate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following two months, however, both Treloar and White were captured and became [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], leaving Petre as the only pilot remaining from the original Half Flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.5-8&quot;/&gt; Around the time of the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (1915)|Battle of Ctesiphon]] in November, he devised an implement shaped like a small [[Rake (tool)|garden rake]] that allowed him to accurately measure ground distances from the air in order to better map the desert terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack pp.21-22&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/02.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 21–22]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Siege of Kut]] between December 1915 and April 1916, he flew a series of missions using crude parachutes to airdrop grain supplies (and a [[millstone]] for grinding), medical supplies and equipment to the town's entrapped garrison, which included nine of his AFC mechanics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.5-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air Force Australia'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Petre was awarded the [[Military Cross]] on 14&amp;nbsp;January 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29438 |supp=yes|startpage=590|date=14 January 1916|accessdate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was mentioned in despatches twice more over the course of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29665|supp=yes|startpage=6959|endpage=6960|date=13 July 1916|accessdate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29789|supp=yes|startpage=10047|endpage=10049|date=19 October 1916|accessdate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1916 he contracted [[typhoid]] and was sent to India for recuperation.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred out of No.&amp;nbsp;30 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al., ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29876 |supp=yes|startpage=12555|date=22 December 1916|accessdate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1917, he was posted to France with [[No. 15 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;15 Squadron RFC]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; a reconnaissance unit operating B.E.2s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/15squadron.cfm|title=15 (R) Squadron|publisher =[[Royal Air Force]]|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later his youngest brother John, a squadron commander in the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] and a [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] recipient, was killed in a flying accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

In his volume on the Air Force for The Australian Centenary History of Defence in 2001, Alan Stephens noted that Petre made &quot;the greater contribution to the establishment of Point Cook and the Central Flying School&quot;, concluding that &quot;perhaps any judgement would not only be moot but also gratuitous, as by circumstance and achievement both men properly belong in the pantheon of the RAAF&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.2-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.710-711&quot;/&gt;
