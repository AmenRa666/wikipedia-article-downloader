== Main Cell Block ==
{{moved from|Talk:History of Fremantle Prison|2=Discussion is relevant to Fremantle Prison and all its sub-articles, not just the history one - &lt;u&gt;'''[[User:Evad37|Evad]]''37'''''&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;[[d:w:User talk:Evad37|talk]]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:13, 21 March 2015 (UTC)}}
Is &quot;Main Cell Block&quot; a proper noun? I suspect not (because requires &quot;the&quot; when used in a sentence, and proper nouns typically do not), so it ought not be capitalised. [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 11:39, 1 November 2014 (UTC)

Likewise &quot;Refractory Block&quot;. [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 11:54, 1 November 2014 (UTC)
:From memory, different sources varied in whether the terms were capitalised or lower case. Perhaps the common nouns got turned into proper nouns as part of the tourist branding? - &lt;u&gt;'''[[User:Evad37|Evad]]''37'''''&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;[[d:w:User talk:Evad37|talk]]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:27, 1 November 2014 (UTC)
::I feel like it probably would be a proper noun in this case, as distinct parts of a heritage site rather than just describing parts of an ordinary prison. [[User:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife]] ([[User talk:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|talk]]) 14:44, 1 November 2014 (UTC)
:::I disagree that it is a proper noun. Unfortunately [http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/11d17b43-eead-41eb-9994-039dbd0e2b78/files/105762.pdf Australian National Heritage Listing Gazettal Notice for Fremantle Prison] is not very helpful - it is not consistent in its use of capitalisation. 
::: (The same issue - capitalisation of Main Cell Block - applies to [[Fremantle Prison]].) [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 09:07, 8 November 2014 (UTC)
:::: I'll review the sources I've used (later tonight or tomorrow) to see if a trend emerges - if so, we can follow what the majority of the sources use. &lt;u&gt;'''[[User:Evad37|Evad]]''37'''''&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;[[d:w:User talk:Evad37|talk]]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:33, 8 November 2014 (UTC)

:The outcome of this discussion would almost certainly apply equally to [[Fremantle Prison]], which has been nominated for GA, so it would be good to resolve it. [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 13:18, 23 November 2014 (UTC)

:I suggest that we go with the majority, and use lower case. I believe that some publications capitalise common nouns for their own style reasons, but I know of no publications that ''un''capitalises proper nouns. Therefore it is more likely that the words are common nouns that some publications have capitalised for style reasons than it is that the words are proper nouns that some publications have ''un''capitalised. If they are common nouns, then Wikipedia should apply its own style rules ([[MOS:CAPS]]) - independently of what others use - and use sentence case. [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 13:21, 23 November 2014 (UTC)

* &lt;edit conflict&gt;Would it not be the case that whether its a proper noun or not would depend on the context in which the Main Cell Block is being referred to, that commonsense is being sacrificed for the sake of consistency. Remembering that one of [[WP:5|WP 5 pillars]] says that policies/guidelines/rules should be interpreted to the spirit not the letter where hinders then ignore the rule. [[User:Gnangarra|Gnan]][[User_talk:Gnangarra|garra]] 13:24, 23 November 2014 (UTC)
** Well, the lead of [[WP:MOS]] does say &quot;Style and formatting should be consistent within an article, though not necessarily throughout Wikipedia&quot;, which seems to mne like a significant part of the spirit of the MOS, along with &quot;The Manual of Style documents Wikipedia's house style&quot;. At the moment, there is no consistency within the articles because I was focusing on building content rather than format/style issues (if there is currently a pattern to the usage, it's by accident rather than design). &lt;small&gt;Also, this is more of an issue for FA than GA, as GA requires only limited MOS compliance.&lt;/small&gt; - &lt;u&gt;'''[[User:Evad37|Evad]]''37'''''&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;[[d:w:User talk:Evad37|talk]]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:31, 23 November 2014 (UTC)
:::&lt;small&gt;Agreed that [[WP:GACR|it won't affect GA]]. [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 13:37, 24 November 2014 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
*** I was coming to say much the same as Gnangarra. I think it varies in the sources because the context varies in the sources, and that ignoring that is - as they put it well - sacrificing common sense for the sake of consistency. [[User:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife]] ([[User talk:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|talk]]) 23:54, 23 November 2014 (UTC)
****Well, what would these contexts be? Or rather, in the contexts it is used in this article and [[Fremantle Prison]], which uses should be capitalised or uncapitalised (especially for statements where multiple sources could have been used as a reference)? - &lt;u&gt;'''[[User:Evad37|Evad]]''37'''''&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;[[d:w:User talk:Evad37|talk]]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:07, 24 November 2014 (UTC)
*****I mean, in the case of Fremantle, you can either refer to it as a proper noun (which most of the legal sources, notably, use), or you can refer to it as a shortening of &quot;the prison at Fremantle&quot;, hence &quot;Fremantle prison&quot;. Equally, one can refer to Main Cell Block (name of the building), or &quot;the main cell block&quot; (description of the building's purpose). Either of those contexts are appropriate, but I strongly prefer the former. I think using &quot;Fremantle prison&quot;, especially, makes us look unprofessional, and like we don't know what a proper noun is. [[User:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife]] ([[User talk:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|talk]]) 04:16, 24 November 2014 (UTC)

Another idea: If it was the subject of a standalone article, all the alternate names would be given in the lead – so why not have something like that here, but with a footnote? E.g. have
----
... the main cell block{{efn|Also known as main cellblock, main cell building, main block, main cell range, Main Cell Block, Main Division, or Main Cell Range}} ...
{{notelist}}
----
(or another way around, depending on consensus) at the first mention - &lt;u&gt;'''[[User:Evad37|Evad]]''37'''''&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;[[d:w:User talk:Evad37|talk]]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:07, 24 November 2014 (UTC)

:I think that's a pretty silly idea. Our readers don't need an explanation to know that &quot;main cell block&quot; and &quot;Main Cell Block&quot; are the same place. [[User:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife]] ([[User talk:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|talk]]) 04:16, 24 November 2014 (UTC)

::If we decided that the article should use a mixture of lowercase and uppercase depending on whether it was a proper noun in that context (for any definition of &quot;context&quot;), it might be appropriate to add a footnote on first upper- and first lower-case use stating why the use is not consistent, eg something like &quot;the term Main Cell Block was only used as a [[proper noun]] after the prison was opened as a tourist attraction; prior to that it was merely a description&quot; (or whatever the case actually is). [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 13:46, 24 November 2014 (UTC)

:::But that would be total original research. I don't understand the aversion to just using proper nouns. [[User:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife]] ([[User talk:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|talk]]) 14:33, 24 November 2014 (UTC)
::::I don't have an aversion to using proper nouns if the term ''is'' a proper noun. However, just because ''some'' sources capitalise a term (possibly for their own style reasons) does not automatically make it a proper noun. [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 11:37, 25 November 2014 (UTC)

:::I agree that such a note would be original research, or original synthesis. At the moment I am happy with the interpretation that the Main Cell Block is a main cell block, and either the proper noun or common noun can be used, or both (as per the sources above). The appropriateness of each usage within our articles is something that may have to be closely scrutinised at FA level. I think the concern would basically be along the lines of (the last paragraph of) {{section link|WP:Manual of Style/Proper names|Place names}}: ''&quot;An article about [[Junipero Serra]] should say he lived in Alta Mexico not the U.S. state of [[California]] because the latter entity did not exist at the time of Junipero Serra. The Romans invaded [[Gaul]], not [[France]], and [[Thabo Mbeki]] was the president of the [[Republic of South Africa]], not of the Cape Colony.&quot;'' So if there is no indication that the proper noun Main Cell Block was used before the 1980s, is it appropriate for our articles to use the proper noun in contexts prior to the 1980s? Perhaps not as big a deal as a complete change in name, but I wouldn't be surprised if something like this came up at FAC. - &lt;u&gt;'''[[User:Evad37|Evad]]''37'''''&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;[[d:w:User talk:Evad37|talk]]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:29, 25 November 2014 (UTC)
::::Again, original research. [[User:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife]] ([[User talk:The Drover&amp;#39;s Wife|talk]]) 11:44, 25 November 2014 (UTC)

===MOS:CAPS===
Going back to [[MOS:CAPS]], the top section says {{gi|Wikipedia relies on sources to determine what is a proper name; words and phrases that are consistently capitalized in sources are treated as proper names and capitalized in Wikipedia.}} For whatever reason (to speculate would be OR), that's not the situation we have here. - &lt;u&gt;'''[[User:Evad37|Evad]]''37'''''&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;[[d:w:User talk:Evad37|talk]]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:48, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

==Main Cell Block RFC==
{{Rfc top| This RFC included the discussion above, it would be hard to separate the discussion on the topic from the question. The consensus finds that Main Cell Block is a proper noun when referring to the specific building.

*I would suggest that it is a proper noun in this context.  It is named '''Main Cell Block''' because it is the main cell block.  It might also have been called First Cell Block or Primary Cell Block or Cell Block A or Large Block or Swan Block or Henderson Block—but it wasn't.  Even though it was named based on common words ''main'', ''cell'' and ''block'', its name is Main Cell Block, just as Fremantle Prison is capitalised as a proper noun even though ''prison'' is a common noun used to describe jails generally.  &lt;small&gt;—'''[[User:sroc|sroc]]'''&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:sroc|&amp;#x1F4AC;]]&lt;/small&gt; 06:35, 22 March 2015 (UTC)

::::::I see what you mean: the question is ''whether'' it goes by the name &quot;Main Cell Block&quot; or if it is merely described as &quot;the main cell block&quot;.  I would think that if it is predominantly referred to as &quot;Main Cell Block&quot; (rather than &quot;original cell block&quot; or &quot;front cell block&quot; or &quot;first cell block&quot; or &quot;primary cell block&quot; or any other equally accurate name), then this suggests it is the name it has taken on, whether or not it is officially named as such.  If it is variously referred to by a variety of names, then this would suggest that &quot;main cell block&quot; is, indeed, just a generic descriptor.
::::::Even if one were to argue that its full name is &quot;Fremantle Prison Main Cell Block&quot;, this does not mean that &quot;Main Cell Block&quot; does not also function as a proper name.  Consider the [[University of Notre Dame Australia#School of Law|University of Notre Dame Australia School of Law]], which could also be referred to simply as the [http://www.nd.edu.au/fremantle/schools/law/lawfreo.shtml School of Law] when the context makes the university clear; &quot;School of Law&quot; serves as a proper name even though it is a descriptive name and even if there is also a more complete name available.  &lt;small&gt;—'''[[User:sroc|sroc]]'''&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:sroc|&amp;#x1F4AC;]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:14, 29 March 2015 (UTC)

*If &quot;Main Cell Block&quot; is a [[proper name]], most instances of &quot;the Main Cell Block&quot; ought be changed to &quot;Main Cell Block&quot;. Generally proper names do not require a leading [[article (grammar)]]. (The consistent use of such an article is a clue that the term is ''not'' a proper name.)

*'''Lower case'''. A cell block is not a discrete enough entity to warrant a proper name, unless they went out of their way to very clearly give it one (e.g. &quot;O'Hare Cell Block&quot;), which they did not; they simply gave it a descriptive label.  See [[Proper name]], and external reliable sources on proper names. The closer something is to a description rather than arbitrary name, the less likely it is to be a proper name. This case is entirely descriptive.  Capitalising &quot;Main Cell Block&quot; is like capitalising &quot;Ninth Floor South Hallway&quot; in the context of a hotel. The name of the hotel is a proper name. A description of some segment of the hotel is not, even if some people connected with the hotel tend to think of it as one.  Capitalising this as &quot;Main Cell Block&quot; is {{em|government style}}, not Wikipedia style. Governments capitalise all sorts of things important to them, in intra-government contexts, as do the specialists in almost all fields in works internal to their fields. WP does not emulate this (even if some journalists do).  See [[WP:Specialist style fallacy]] for why, and for why the arguments in favor of doing so are logically faulty. See the RFC [[WP:BIRDCON]], the culmination of over eight years of time wasted by specialists trying to force ungrammatical capitalisation on the encyclopedia to match the house style of some journals in their field, for a strong precedent against doing so. &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'&quot;&gt; — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽&lt;sup&gt;ʌ&lt;/sup&gt;ⱷ҅&lt;sub&gt;ᴥ&lt;/sub&gt;ⱷ&lt;sup&gt;ʌ&lt;/sup&gt;≼ &lt;/span&gt; 14:31, 28 March 2015 (UTC)
**I find it odd that you think an entire building &quot;is not a discrete enough entity to warrant a proper name, unless they went out of their way to very clearly give it one&quot;. Is there some non-subjective cut-off point between things that can have proper names that are also descriptive – e.g. Beach Road that runs along the beach – and those that can't? I don't see anything along those lines in the [[Proper name]] article that you link; in fact, one of the examples is &quot;I believe Rose lives on Floor 3 of the Main Building.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [Main Building is the name of the building, Floor 3 names the third floor, and Rose names a person]&quot;. - &lt;u&gt;'''[[User:Evad37|Evad]]''37'''''&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;[[d:w:User talk:Evad37|talk]]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:51, 29 March 2015 (UTC)

***{{ec}} Evad37: Then the [[Proper name]] article has been edited to include an incorrect example (and I've disputed it at that article, as the example is unsourced nonsense).&lt;p&gt;No, there is no non-subjective cut-off point in all cases, or discussions like this would not occur; the point of such discussions is, precisely, to form a consensus among editors when the answer {{em|isn't}} already self-evident.  Some descriptions become proper names, and some proper names are descriptive when created, but note the difference between &quot;I live on Beach Road&quot; and &quot;I live on the beach road&quot;. Compare to &quot;He was incarcerated in Main Cell Block&quot; vs. &quot;He was incarcerated in the main cell block&quot;.  This article refers to it as the main cell block, with &quot;the&quot;; that's a distinguishing, non-metaphoric description, not a name. Our article uses this Beach/beach example, but you don't seem to have understood it. You skipped this part: &quot;as a proper name, Beach Road may have nothing to do with the beach; it may be any distance from the waterfront&quot; (e.g., it could have been named after someone whose surname was Beach). What cinches this case this RfC is about is that this arbitrariness does {{em|not}} apply to the prison's main cell block; it is and must be the actual cell block that is &quot;main&quot; or primary.  Contrast this with some prison's &quot;Maine Cell Block&quot;, an arbitrary name perhaps from the US state or someone's surname.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no particular reason to treat descriptively labelled individual buildings of a complex as proper names. [[WP:ILIKEIT|You just want to]]. Having space between one building and another, instead of that constituent part of the prison sharing a wall with another, doesn't magically make its description a proper name.  For WP purposes, no, this one non-notable building among many in a prison (that is notable only as a whole) is not a discrete entity, any more than your left elbow is separate from you, and is your Left Elbow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To modify the hotel example to refer to separate buildings: The south tower of a hotel is the south tower of the hotel, not the South Tower of the hotel, even if employees capitalise it that way in internal memos. There can be conventional exceptions, but only when pretty much {{em|all}} reliable sources agree to treat them as such, e.g. the South Tower of the [[World Trade Center]], a [once] massive landmark that co-dominated the New York City skyline, and thus naturally lent itself to having its descriptive label treated as a proper name. Thus also cases like &quot;the Rocky Mountains&quot;. Nothing like that applies to one building in a prison, a building unknown to much of anyone but its staff and inmates.  The implied reasoning that they and their opinions (assumed - we have no source) to treat it as a proper name are enough to make it, one would naturally lead to the incorrect conclusion that my upstairs bathroom is proper-named the Upstairs Bathroom just because I named it that and think of it as a name not a description. If I gave it an arbitrary name, like Lavatorianaland, or an evocative or metaphoric but partially descriptive one, like the Tiny Bathroom of Doom, those would be proper names; but purely, literally descriptive labels are not. See again the Rocky Mountains example.  All mountains are rocky, so this is an evocative name, not a distinguishing label. &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'&quot;&gt; — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽&lt;sup&gt;ʌ&lt;/sup&gt;ⱷ҅&lt;sub&gt;ᴥ&lt;/sub&gt;ⱷ&lt;sup&gt;ʌ&lt;/sup&gt;≼ &lt;/span&gt; 15:31, 29 March 2015 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;
::::Thank you for your further explanation – although I'll note that telling me &quot;you just want to&quot;, linking to [[WP:ILIKEIT]], was quite unnecessary – in this and the previous discussion above, I have not been arguing based on on personal preference. Questioning arguments I don't fully understand has nothing to do with [[WP:ILIKEIT]]. But I digress. Regarding Beach Road, the article does say that &quot;as a proper name, Beach Road may have nothing to do with the beach; it may be any distance from the waterfront&quot;, but doesn't appear to preclude the possibility that Beach Road may well run along the beach – &quot;may have nothing to do with the beach&quot;, not &quot;does not...&quot;, &quot;can not...&quot;, &quot;will not...&quot;, or &quot;must not...&quot;. 
::::Anyway, if I'm understanding you correctly, names/terms can either be:
::::*Arbitrary, or evocative or metaphoric but partially descriptive – proper names that should be capitalised, e.g. O'Hare Cell Block, Tiny Bathroom of Doom, Beach Road (if named after Joe Beach)
::::*Literally descriptive, but capitalised in pretty much all reliable sources – should be treated like proper names and capitalised – e.g. South Tower of the World Trade Center, [[West Wing]] of the White House {{small|(presumably, I haven't actually looked at usage in sources)}}, Beach Road (if it runs along the beach, so that it is literally the beach road)
::::*Literally descriptive, and not capitalised or not consistently capitalised in all reliable sources – not proper names, and should not be capitalised – e.g. the south tower of ''[some hotel]'', the science library at ''[some university]'', the beach road (for some other road that just happens to run along the beach)
::::(a) Is that correct {{small|(assuming &quot;all reliable sources&quot; is a wide range of sources so that it isn't a case of [[WP:Specialist style fallacy]])}}?

*'''Both''', depending on usage &lt;small&gt;(summoned by LegoBot)&lt;/small&gt; - I'm not familiar with this topic, but it is apparent from reading various sources that &quot;Main Cell Block&quot; is the proper name for this prison's primary detention building, or main cell block. The fact that it is a horribly generic title is unfortunate and confusing, but it is a proper title when used in the context of referring to that building specifically. For cases in this article where it is necessary to refer to Main Cell Block as the prison's main cell block, I suggest rewording to refer to it as the primary cell block, or central detention building, or something else to limit the confusion. For comparison:
:*&quot;[[Centre Block]] is the &lt;s&gt;central/middle&lt;/s&gt; main building of the Canadian parliamentary complex ...&quot;
:*&quot;[[Main Street, Letterkenny]] is &lt;s&gt;the main street&lt;/s&gt; an important thoroughfare in Letterkenny ...&quot;

== Conversion from sentence case to title case in reference titles ==
I disagree with this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fremantle_Prison&amp;diff=653018584&amp;oldid=652838379 this] conversion of ''title'' in reference from sentence case to title case where the original reference is sentence case. I believe we should not change the case of title (unless converting from all caps to sentence or title, per [[MOS:ALLCAPS]]) - we should reproduce the original faithfully.

Is there a specific MOS policy covering this? Are newspaper articles deemed to be &quot;compositions&quot; for the purposes of [[MOS:CT]]? I would have thought not. [[MOS:ALLCAPS]] strongly implies that headlines are not compositions, by advising us to &quot;Reduce newspaper headlines and other titles from all caps to ''sentence case'' or title case&quot;. (If headlines are compositions, clearly MOS:ALLCAPS needs changing.)

== Henry Wray ==
The article text currently has exactly one mention of Wray:
{{quotation|Construction of the northern wing followed, however, the Crimean War saw the Royal Engineers recalled. Prisoners were left to finish the building, under the direction of Wray.}}
with no link, and nothing to indicate who he was. 

I considered this simple addition:
{{quotation|Construction of the northern wing followed, however, the Crimean War saw the Royal Engineers recalled. Prisoners were left to finish the building, under the direction of &lt;u&gt;Royal Engineer [[Henry Wray|Henry Wray]]&lt;/u&gt;.}}

However this does not make sense given the preceding &quot;... Royal Engineers recalled ...&quot;. If Wray was a Royal Engineer, was he recalled or not?

I checked [[History of Fremantle Prison#Construction]] but it doesn't help, with:
{{quotation|Construction ... supervised by ... Royal Engineer lieutenant Henry Wray, who had arrived with another convict ship. ... 

Works rapidly progressed following the arrival of Wray in 1851 with the Royal Engineers, ... 

... [1857] ... the Crimean War saw Royal Engineers recalled. Prisoners were left to finish the building, under the direction of Wray ...}}

It has the same &quot;problem&quot; - the REs were recalled, leaving work to the convicts, supervised by an RE.

Some rewording may be required (in both articles) to state explicitly that while the Royal Engineers were recalled, Wray was not included in that recall. [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 09:09, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
