== Mess of titles ==

Seeing [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philip_II_of_Spain&amp;oldid=501370831 this version] of the page I note: 

The denomination of Spain in the singular is not anachronistic: Philip the second king of Spain was used in the same period.
*[http://books.google.es/books?id=vMSpET9KxJ8C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EmL7T5qQBI-ZhQe_r4jOBg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false] ''Don Felipe por la gracia de Dios Rey de España''
*[http://books.google.es/books?id=5B48AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA419&amp;dq=&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hWL7T8XxIoTChAfzhOyeDw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false] ''y el Catolico Rey de España Don Felipe el segundo''
*[http://books.google.es/books?id=2y87AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hWL7T8XxIoTChAfzhOyeDw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false] ''el Rey Don Felipe, por diuina gracia Rey de España, Inglaterra... ''

Titles, Honors, and Styles is a real mess and original research because the Titles, Honors, and Styles are confused with the divisions and administrative entities, which is a huge mistake. 
* Which is the justification of putting ordinal absolutely to everything? Does or did it exist in that epoch such names? It is clear enough to indicate simply his titles, honors and styles without adding at all costs an ordinal which is a result of an original investigation and aparticular reflection. The maximum exponent of this speculation is to put the ordinals to titles as prince of Asturias which have never had ordinal, in fact, the current Prince of Asturias doesn't display any ordinal.

* The denomination of kingdom does not correspond to a realm-kingdom sui juris, but provinces denominated as kingdom, as Murcia, Granada, Jaen, Cordoba and Seville [http://books.google.es/books?id=NwFafLvE9IMC&amp;pg=PR27&amp;dq=&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Amr7T_epA4uLhQeW_4TjBg&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false] ''Esta diversidad regional castellana no tenía ninguna traducción en el terreno legal. Los reinos de Castilla, de León, de Córdoba, no existían más que en la tradición.'' [http://books.google.es/books?id=Wwo0KKFn3FsC&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false] ''Los títulos oficiales siguen mencionando los reinos de Castilla, León, Toledo, Jaén, Córdoba, Sevilla el Algarve, Algeciras, Gibraltar y Murcia, pero se trata de supervivencias formales, sin consecuencias para las estructuras políticas y administrativas, muy unificadas o en vías de unificación.''

:The Algarve was not a kingdom sui juris with his own institutions, legislation, but a Portuguese province; on the contrary, Navarre was in effect a kingdom sui juris with his own institutions, legislation, coinage... but inside the Crown of Castile. The territories of the crown of Aragon were territories sui juris with his own own institutions, as Sardinia [http://books.google.es/books?id=59a4xkh-je8C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R1_7T8WIBdSKhQfRxonaBg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false] The principality of Catalonia was the political administrative entity, but the title was that of count of Barcelona.

* In America there were provinces (governorates) denominated as kingdoms but they were not kingdoms sui juris. The kingdom of Chile was no exception since they existed the kingdom of New Spain, New Kingdom of Leon, Kingdom of Tierra Firme, New Kingdom of Granada, Kingdom of Peru, all within the crown of Castile, as the kingdom of Murcia, Seville, Granada...

*There is no current scientific and reliable sources attesting the establishment of the kingdom of Chile in 1554, in fact, it is an invention that appears in the chronicle of [[Diego de Rosales]] [http://books.google.es/books?id=7Vk_6ZW-mucC&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;dq=&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]

* By the way, what kind of reference is this one: [http://books.google.no/books?id=6hgmESDLZM4C&amp;vq=cerdagne&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]: a book of history of art, doesn't exist any books about political history?. Seeing that the book denominated the order of Santiago as ''Order of Compostello'', a non-existent name, it gives me an idea about his reliable quality in this matter.

* There are some anachronistic flags and others not, but his discernment is not for a biographical article and its placement does not contribute anything to the link. In addition, there is already an heraldic gallery in another epigraph.

* In an epigraph denominated as ''Titles, Honors, and Styles'' is logical and coherent to use styling titles, nevertheless, the crazy thing is to present them as if they were real administrative divisions and due to it, a confusion takes place between the title and the administrative divisions. As a example of this confusion is putting the ordinal (PHILIP VI???!!!!) to kingdom of France, a title of claim reminiscent of the war of Hundred Years.

== Section on economics is mush ==

The third paragraph of the section on economics of this article, as it stands on 11/29/2012, is nonsensical and bizarre.  Who is &quot;George Greenstreet&quot;?  There is no such personage.  Someone took the care to convert &quot;centralize&quot; to &quot;centralise&quot; within a paragraph that reads like a an overcooked bean casserole.  I am tempted to remove the entire paragraph as garbage but would probably get slapped with an edit revert.  Who wrote this stuff?  E.g.:
:''Calls to move his Court to Lisbon from the Castilian stronghold of Madrid — the new village Philip established following the move from Valladolid — as the traditional Royal and Primacy seat of Toledo have become obsolete to the growth of its weight by its constrained orography, could have led to prevent the further growth of centralisation and bureaucracy in the peninsula and to ease for the Empire, but Philip for obvious personal reasons too opposed such efforts, with backing from George Greenstreet. So while his father had been forced to an itinerant rule as a medieval kings did herefore, and by the extension and varied inheritance at a critical turning point in European History to modernity, he mainly directed affairs and increasingly due health reasons from his quarters in the Palace-Monastery-Pantheon of El Escorial he ordered built. ''

Born: 22 September 1515

Married to King Henry VIII: 6 January 1540
 Greenwich

Marriage to Henry VIII dissolved: July 1540

Died: 16 July 1557
 Chelsea Manor, London

Buried: 4 August 1557
 Westminster Abbey
 

Henry VIII remained single for over two years after Jane Seymour's death, possibly giving some credence to the thought that he genuinely mourned for her. However, it does seem that someone, possibly Thomas Cromwell, began making inquiries shortly after Jane's death about a possible foreign bride for Henry.

Henry's first marriage had been a foreign alliance of sorts, although it is almost certain that the two were truly in love for some time. His next two brides were love matches and Henry could have had little or no monetary or political gain from them.

But the events of the split from Rome left England isolated, and probably vulnerable. It was these circumstances that led Henry and his ministers to look at the possibility of a bride to secure an alliance. Henry did also want to be sure he was getting a desirable bride, so he had agents in foreign courts report to him on the appearance and other qualities of various candidates. He also sent painters to bring him images of these women.

Hans Holbein, probably the most famous of the Tudor court painters, was sent to the court of the Duke of Cleves, who had two sisters: Amelia and Anne. When Holbein went in 1539, Cleves was seen as an important potential ally in the event France and the Holy Roman Empire (who had somewhat made a truce in their long history of conflict) decided to move against the countries who had thrown off the Papal authority. England then sought alliances with countries who had been supporting the reformation of the church. Several of the Duchys and principalities along the Rhine were Lutheran. Holbein painted the sisters of the Duke of Cleves and Henry decided to have a contract drawn up for his marriage to Anne.

Although the King of France and the Emperor had gone back to their usual state of animosity, Henry proceeded with the match. The marriage took place on January 6, 1540. By then, Henry was already looking for ways to get out of the marriage.

Anne was ill-suited for life at the English court. Her upbringing in Cleves had concentrated on domestic skills and not the music and literature so popular at Henry's court. And, most famously, Henry did not find his new bride the least bit attractive and is said to have called her a 'Flanders Mare'. In addition to his personal feelings for wanting to end the marriage, there were now political ones as well. Tension between the Duke of Cleves and the Empire was increasing towards war and Henry had no desire to become involved. Last but not least, at some point, Henry had become attracted to young Kathryn Howard.

Anne was probably smart enough to know that she would only be making trouble for herself if she raised any obstacles to Henry's attempts to annul the marriage. She testified that the match had not been consummated and that her previous engagement to the son of the Duke of Lorraine had not been properly broken.

After the marriage had been dissolved, Anne accepted the honorary title as the 'King's Sister'. She was given property, including Hever Castle, formerly the home of Anne Boleyn.

Anne lived away from court quietly in the countryside until 1557 and attended the coronation of her former step-daughter, Mary I.

She is buried in a somewhat hard to find tomb in Westminster Abbey.''' ''Italic text''

==King of France==
Would he not, as King of England and Ireland also hold the title King of France? Do we not included claimed titles?</text>
