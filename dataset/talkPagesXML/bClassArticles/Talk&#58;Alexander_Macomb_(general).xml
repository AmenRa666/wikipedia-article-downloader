__FORCETOC__

==citations missing==
I was [[WP:BOLD]] and removed the {{tl|citations missing}} as it was tagged from &lt;code&gt;date=September 2007&lt;/code&gt; and the article has been improved and has several citations.  If anyone spots something specific, please tag it as {{tl|citation needed}} so it can be addressed.  Thx.&lt;small&gt; &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:MrDolomite|MrDolomite]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:MrDolomite|Talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:02, 25 July 2008 (UTC)

==Infobox question==
I don't do infoboxes on members of the General Staff, so I don't really know how this works.  Macomb had many ranks and a number of postings, and I don't know if they should be shown or not.  I defer to those military mavens who understand the concepts better than I.

::Read the link I posted on your talk page.  It links to the Military person template that explains all the headings and what should be listed on them. [[User:Asher196|Asher196]] ([[User talk:Asher196|talk]]) 18:51, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

==Pronunciation of Macomb==
The alleged pronunciation (May like the month) is not the way it is said in Ma (like your mother) comb County, Michigan.  The second syllable is accented, but is pronounced like the &quot;comb&quot; you use in your hair, not &quot;come&quot; as in a direction to 'come here.'  I've lived there for 46 years, and have NEVER heard it pronounced that way.  Maybe that's what they say in New York?

:I can attest to the pronunciation provided by [[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|7&amp;amp;6=thirteen]].  I live just north of there, and it's always pronounced &quot;Muh Comb&quot;. [[User:Asher196|Asher196]] ([[User talk:Asher196|talk]]) 22:54, 3 August 2008 (UTC)
::I think Ash has it exactly right, FWIW.  The only strange (mis)pronunciation I've ever heard that ever approximated the one in the first paragraph of the article was a few years back by an automated telephone voice that was giving me a telephone number.

==Reference format problem.  HELP==
Am having problem with an unclosed footnote.  Can't seem to find the solution.  HELP.  [[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|7&amp;amp;6=thirteen]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|talk]]) 14:57, 20 August 2008 (UTC) Stan

==Order of this article==
I like the appearance of this article the way it is presently ordered -- visually it works very nicely.  OTOH, the Congressional Gold Medal preceded his being promoted to Commanding General.  In that sense, a chronological presentation might be better.  Any thoughts?

==Somebody deleted that wonderful portrait==
Sadly, the info box is looking kind of empty.  They did something similar to the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]. [[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|7&amp;amp;6=thirteen]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|talk]]) 15:57, 7 September 2008 (UTC)  Stan
:That was cured in this article.  [[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|7&amp;amp;6=thirteen]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|talk]]) 17:13, 7 September 2008 (UTC) Stan

==Plattsburgh or Plattsburg==
I changed all of the to the former to conform to the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]] article, but left one that seems to be a quotation from the Congressional resolution in the latter spelling.  Can somebody check on that?  Thanks.  [[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|7&amp;amp;6=thirteen]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|talk]]) 17:13, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

Indeed sic Plattsburg not Plattsburgh in the resolution.  See [http://books.google.com/books?id=KJE_AAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA6-PA3&amp;ots=Cn9izC1Mui&amp;dq=%22in%20defeating%20the%20enemy%20at%20Plattsburg%20on%20the%20eleventh%20of%20September%22&amp;pg=RA6-PA3&amp;ci=136%2C1102%2C762%2C229&amp;source=bookclip ''The Public Statues at Large of the United States of America''] [[User: mlloyd57]]  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 17:14, 24 December 2010 (UTC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Newark Academy ==

Someone in the interest of linking to the Article &quot;Newark, New Jersey&quot; put &quot;a Newark, New Jersey academy&quot; but Macomb attended Newark Academy in Livingston, NJ.  Besides, I think it more likely a person reading this will want to see what Newark Academy is about rather than wondering what Newark New Jersey is.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mlloyd57|Mlloyd57]] ([[User talk:Mlloyd57|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mlloyd57|contribs]]) 03:54, 4 January 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Detroit, Michigan ==

In order to link to the article for Detroit, the text stated Detroit, Michigan.  That added problems, and so we now had &quot;Born in Detroit, Michigan, at the time was part of British North America, Macomb was the son of Alexander Macomb and Mary Catherine Navarre&quot; which is difficult to read.  That is, we have a comma between the city and the state (which didn't yet exist), a comma between Michigan and Macomb as an appositive and parenthetical commas between at the time...North America.  I changed to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] because Detroit is technically correct and Detroit, Michigan is the WP article.  I added parentheses to avoid the confusion between the aside and the other commas.  Perhaps we can do without the parenthetical altogether now? [[User:Mlloyd57|Mlloyd57]] ([[User talk:Mlloyd57|talk]]) 04:01, 4 January 2011 (UTC)
:You are correct of course about the anachronism.  Maybe it would he better to say he was born in the environs of (or near or at) [[Fort Detroit]] or [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], which was then part of [[British North America]]? Detroit did exist and was founded in 1701, long before Macomb was born, but it was in BNA and not Michigan or the United States at the time.  [[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|7&amp;amp;6=thirteen]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|talk]]) 14:02, 4 January 2011 (UTC) Stan

Not just the environs of Detroit or near Detroit certainly but at Detroit, since he was born at Government House, Detroit which at the time belonged to his uncle William Macomb, and the former home of Mary Anne Navarre, my several greats aunt.  Please see http://www.mlloyd.org/gen/macomb/text/cass-hse.htm. [[User:Mlloyd57|Mlloyd57]] ([[User talk:Mlloyd57|talk]]) 02:07, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

See if my change suites?  Part of my objection to most of the above is having too many words, clauses etc. appear between the adjective &quot;born&quot; and its antecedent &quot;Macomb.&quot;  [[User:Mlloyd57|Mlloyd57]] ([[User talk:Mlloyd57|talk]]) 02:13, 10 January 2011 (UTC)
