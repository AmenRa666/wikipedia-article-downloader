The '''''Peyk-i Şevket'' class''' was a pair of [[torpedo cruiser]]s built for the [[Ottoman Navy]] by the German shipyard [[Germaniawerft]] in 1906&amp;ndash;07. The class comprised two ships: {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Peyk-i Şevket||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Berk-i Satvet||2}}. They were ordered as part of a program to modernize the Ottoman fleet at the turn of the century. The ships were small vessels, at only {{convert|775|MT|sp=us}}; they were nevertheless heavily armed for their size, with three [[torpedo tube]]s and a pair of {{convert|105|mm|abbr=on}} guns along with several smaller weapons.

Neither ship saw action during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911&amp;ndash;12, as ''Peyk-i Şevket'' had been interned in [[Suez]] and ''Berk-i Satvet'' spent the war confined to the [[Sea of Marmara]] with the main Ottoman fleet. Both ships took a more active role in the [[Balkan Wars]], frequently providing gunfire to support to Ottoman troops in [[East Thrace]]. During [[World War I]], both ships served in the [[Black Sea]], where they conducted patrols, escorted convoys, and attacked Russian ports. In January 1915, ''Berk-i Satvet'' was [[naval mine|mined]] off the [[Bosporus]], and seven months later, ''Peyk-i Şevket'' was torpedoed by the British submarine {{HMS|E11}} in the Sea of Marmara. Both ships were repaired and returned to service by 1918.

After the end of the war, both ships were kept in service with the new [[Turkish Navy]], with lengthy overhauls in the mid-1920s. Both ships were extensively modernized in the late 1930s, and they remained in service to 1944, when they were finally decommissioned. Both vessels were ultimately broken up in the early 1950s.

==Design==

The ''Peyk-i Şevket'' class was classified as a [[torpedo cruiser]] by the [[Ottoman Navy]],&lt;ref&gt;''Fleets of the World'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; but was also sometimes referred to as a [[torpedo gunboat]].&lt;ref name=GG392&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; The two ships were authorized in 1903, and were ordered from the [[Krupp]]-owned [[Germaniawerft]] shipyard in Germany, as part of a deal to modernize the elderly [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] {{ship|Ottoman ironclad|Âsâr-ı Tevfik||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The two cruisers were part of a naval reconstruction program that began in the late 1890s, following the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897, in which the Ottoman fleet had been unable to play an active role.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, pp. 9&amp;ndash;11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
The ships were {{convert|80.1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long, with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. They displaced {{convert|775|MT|abbr=on}} while on [[sea trial]]s. By 1938, their displacement had increased to {{convert|850|MT|abbr=on}}. The ships were fitted with two [[pole mast]]s, the foremast just aft of the [[conning tower]] and the main mast further aft. The [[forecastle]] deck extended to the base of the forward [[funnel (ship)|funnel]], and the [[quarterdeck]] was stepped down aft of the mainmast. They were steel-hulled ships and carried no armor protection. Their crew numbered 125&amp;nbsp;officers and enlisted men as completed, and it had risen to 145 by 1915.&lt;ref name=GG392/&gt;&lt;ref name=LG1489&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, pp. 148&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships were powered by a pair of vertical [[triple-expansion engine]]s each driving a [[screw propeller]]. Their four coal-fired [[Three-drum boiler#Thornycroft-Schulz boiler|Schulz]] [[water-tube boiler]]s, manufactured by [[Germaniawerft]], were trunked into two funnels. The engines were rated at {{convert|5100|ihp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}, though on trials they reached {{convert|22|kn|abbr=on}}. By 1915, poor maintenance and heavy use had reduced their speed to {{convert|18|kn|abbr=on}}. The ''Peyk-i Şevket''-class ships had storage capacity for {{convert|244|MT|abbr=on}} of coal, which provided a cruising radius of {{convert|3240|nmi|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=GG392/&gt;&lt;ref name=LG1489/&gt;

The two ''Peyk-i Şevket''-class cruisers' primary offensive armament was their three {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s. One was mounted in the bow, above water, and the other two were in deck-mounted swivel launchers [[amidships]]. They were armed with a pair of {{convert|105|mm|abbr=on}} quick-firing 40-[[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns that were placed in shielded single mounts on the forecastle and quarterdeck. They also carried six {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} 40-caliber guns, four of which were mounted in [[sponson]]s, a pair of {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and two [[machine gun]]s.&lt;ref name=GG392/&gt;&lt;ref name=LG149/&gt;

===Modifications===
Both ships were rebuilt in the late 1930s and incorporated substantial improvements. Both [[Stem (ship)|stem]] and stern were rebuilt, with a new raked bow. Their [[superstructure]] was also reconstructed. The old gun armament was replaced with a pair of {{convert|88|mm|abbr=on}} 45-caliber guns and four 37&amp;nbsp;mm 40-caliber guns, and ''Berk-i Satvet'' received equipment to handle 25 [[naval mine]]s.&lt;ref name=GG392/&gt;&lt;ref name=LG149/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Ottoman Fleet 1914.png|thumb|Silhouettes of the major warships of the Ottoman Navy in 1914; the ''Peyk-i Şevket''-class is the fourth ship in the second row]]

Both ships saw extensive service with the Ottoman fleet over the course of the decade following their arrival in November 1907. They took part in the first fleet maneuver conducted by the fleet in over twenty years in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Neither ship saw action during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911&amp;ndash;12, as ''Peyk-i Şevket'' had been interned at British-controlled [[Suez]] at the outbreak of war,&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Berk-i Satvet'' was stationed with the reserve fleet in the [[Sea of Marmara]], which did not risk confrontation with the significantly stronger Italian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Both ships saw combat during the [[First Balkan War]] in 1913, primarily in supporting Ottoman forces ashore in [[East Thrace]]. The ships provided gunfire support to the Ottoman army holding the [[Çatalca]] line in defense of the capital at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt; ''Berk-i Satvet'' also took part in two brief skirmishes with the [[Greek Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire joined [[World War I]] in November 1914; ''Peyk-i Şevket'' and ''Berk-i Satvet'' primarily operated in the [[Black Sea]] against the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]]. They frequently patrolled the Ottoman coast, particularly off the [[Bosporus]], and escorted convoys to western [[Anatolia]]. On one of these convoy operations in January 1915, ''Berk-i Satvet'' struck a mine that wrecked her stern. She was towed back to Constantinople and repaired,&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; returning to service in 1918.&lt;ref name=LG149/&gt; ''Peyk-i Şevket'' returned to the Sea of Marmara during the [[Dardanelles Campaign]] in 1915, where she carried munitions to the defending Ottoman forces. On 6 August, she was torpedoed by the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|E11}} and was badly damaged,&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; with repairs lasting until 1917.&lt;ref name=LG149/&gt; Both ships were used as convoy escorts in the Black Sea in the final year of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The two cruisers were retained by the new [[Turkish Navy]] following the end of the [[Turkish War of Independence]] in 1923, and their names were shortened to ''Peyk'' and ''Berk''. Lengthy overhauls followed, in 1924&amp;ndash;5 for ''Berk'' and 1927&amp;ndash;9 for ''Peyk''. They were modernized a decade later, in 1936&amp;ndash;8 for ''Peyk'' and 1937&amp;ndash;9 for ''Berk''. The ships remained in service until 1944, when they were stricken from the [[naval register]] and laid up at the [[Gölcük Naval Shipyard]] before being scrapped after 1953.&lt;ref name=GG392/&gt;&lt;ref name=LG149/&gt;
