'''Thomas William Sweeny''' (December 25, 1820&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; April 10, 1892) was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-American [[United States Army|soldier]] who served in the [[Mexican-American War]] and then was a general in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Birth and early years==
Sweeny was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]], on [[Christmas Day]], 1820. He immigrated to the United States in 1833. In 1846, he enlisted as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the 2nd New York Volunteers, and fought under General [[Winfield Scott]] in [[Mexico]]. Sweeny was wounded in the groin at the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], and his right arm was so badly injured at the [[Battle of Churubusco]] that it had to be amputated. For his heroics, his fellow servicemen nicknamed him &quot;Fighting Tom&quot;. Despite this possibly career-ending injury, he continued serving with the [[2nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd US Infantry]] until the outbreak of the Civil War. Sweeny was active in the [[Yuma War]] (1850–1853), fighting in several engagements against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native American]]s.

==Civil War==
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Sweeny was in command of the [[St. Louis Arsenal|arsenal]] at [[St. Louis, Missouri]]  In reply to efforts of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers to induce him to surrender that important post, he declared that before he would do so, he would blow it up.  As second in command, he participated in the capture of [[Camp Jackson Affair|Camp Jackson]] in May 1861 and later assisted in organizing the [[Indian Home Guard (American Civil War)|Home Guards]]. He was chosen as the [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of that organization.

Sweeny commanded the Fifty-second Illinois at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]].  At [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], in command of a brigade, he successfully defended a gap in the [[Union Army|Union]] line. He was wounded in the battle having received two shots in his only remaining arm and a shot in one of his legs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0407.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sweeny kept the field until the close of the fight, exciting the admiration of the whole army. He returned to command his regiment but returned to brigade command when General [[Pleasant A. Hackleman]] was killed at [[Second Battle of Corinth|Corinth]].  He commanded the Second Division of the [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|Sixteenth Army Corps]] in the [[Atlanta Campaign|Atlanta campaign]]. At the [[Battle of Atlanta]] Sweeny's division intercepted [[John B. Hood]]'s flank attack.  Sweeny got into a fistfight with his corps commander, General [[Grenville M. Dodge]], when Dodge broke protocol and personally directed one of Sweeny's brigades during the fight. Sweeny received a [[court-martial]] for these actions but was acquitted. He mustered out of the volunteers in August 1865, and was dismissed for going [[AWOL]] by the end of the year.

In 1866, he commanded the ill-fated [[Fenian raids|Fenian invasion of Canada]], after which he was arrested for breaking [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] laws between the United States and Britain, but was soon released. He was reinstated with his former rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] later that year, and retired from the [[Regular Army]] in May 1870 as a brigadier general.

Sweeny retired to Astoria on [[Long Island]]. He died there on April 10, 1892, and is buried in [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]].
