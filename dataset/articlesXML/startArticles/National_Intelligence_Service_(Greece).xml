The '''National Intelligence Service''' ('''NIS''') ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Εθνική Υπηρεσία Πληροφοριών, ΕΥΠ, ''Ethniki Ypiresia Pliroforion'', ''EYP'') is the national [[intelligence agency]] of [[Greece]]. Originally modeled on the [[United States Central Intelligence Agency]], it was established in 1953 as the Central Intelligence Service (CIS), specializing in [[intelligence gathering]], [[counterintelligence]] activities, securing sensitive state communications. 

As Greece's primary intelligence agency, NIS is responsible for a range of domestic and foreign matters, ranging from criminal activities and civil rights violations, to terrorism and espionage. Although its agents can be armed for their protection, the agency does not have prosecutorial and detention powers. During wartime, it can fulfill the role of [[military intelligence]].

Headquartered in [[Athens]], NIS is an autonomous public civilian service subordinate to the [[Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection]] and in turn the [[Ministry of the Interior and Administrative Reconstruction]]. The majority of its 1,800 personnel are [[civil servants]], although the agency also employs scientific and technical contractors, officers of each branch of the [[Greek Armed Forces]], and members of the [[Fire Service of Greece|Fire Service]] and [[Hellenic Police]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/world/greece/nomikos2.pdf Greek Intelligence Service (NIS-EYP:Past, Present and Future]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Mission==
NIS's mission is to advance Greece's strategic interests by safeguarding political, financial, and military assets; preventing and countering criminal and military threats; and collecting, processing, and disseminating information to relevant authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nis.gr/portal/page/portal/NIS/Competences] NIS Competencies and Responsibilities&lt;/ref&gt; This broad mandate grants the organization many responsibilities, including advising policymakers, cooperating with the Military Intelligence Directorate (DDSP), and coordinating with foreign partners. 

==Personnel==
The Director of the National Intelligence Service is [[Yiannis Roubatis]].

The agency is directly responsible to the ''Minister for Citizen Protection'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nis.gr/npimages/docs/215-2009en.pdf  Act of Legislative Content 215 of 13 October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; who can appoint or dismiss the Director.

NIS employs the following categories of personnel:
* Permanent civilian personnel.
* Scientific civilian personnel, serving on the basis of private contracts of employment.
* A number of officers on active service in the Armed Forces, the Coast Guard or the Hellenic Police. An unspecified number of national field agents are also employed.

==History==
The agency was founded on 7 May 1953 (Law 2421/1953) under the name '''Central Intelligence Service''' ({{lang-el|Κεντρική Υπηρεσία Πληροφοριών, ΚΥΠ}}), which it retained until 27 August 1986, when it was renamed and reestablished as the '''National Intelligence Service''' by [[ministerial decree]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nis.gr/English/LegalFrameEN/legalframeen.html ministerial decree 1645/86]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The agency was created by influential [[Greek-American]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agents, the most famous being [[Thomas Karamessines]], who later rose to become [[Deputy Director for Plans]] in the CIA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linardatos&quot;&gt;Linardatos, ''Apo ton Emfylio sti Hounda'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Its first, most influential and longest-serving Director was Alexandros Natsinas, a [[Lieutenant General]] of [[Artillery]] and veteran of [[World War II]] and the [[Greek Civil War]]. He headed the agency from its founding in May 1953 until December 1963. From the very beginning, KYP was controlled by the CIA; in the first eleven years of its history (1953–1964) its agents received their salaries from the Americans, not the Greek state, until Prime Minister [[Georgios Papandreou]], enraged with this level of dependence, stopped this practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linardatos&quot;/&gt; During the [[Regime of the Colonels]] of 1967–1974, KYP actively supported the ruling Colonels in silencing dissent. After [[Andreas Papandreou]] came to power in 1981, he was determined to totally control the state apparatus, including the intelligence services, which historically had been staffed exclusively by people with right-wing political views. He appointed as head of KYP Lieutenant General Georgios Politis, a close friend of retired General, [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] Member of Parliament and Minister Antonis Drosogiannis; Politis organized a massive purge of right-wing personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Economist Foreign report, vol 1805–1840, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Ιn 1986 KYP became a civilian agency, EYP, by ministerial decree 1645/86. In recent years, its Directors have been diplomats, while traditionally they were military officers.

==Current leadership==
N.I.S.'s current Director General is [[Yiannis Roubatis]].

Former directors include, Ambassador Bikas, a career diplomat who has served in the United States and Canada, and in [[Algeria]] and [[Iraq]] in the Middle East; when he was stationed in Iraq, Ambassador Bikas was active in securing profitable oil deals for Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Το Βήμα, 18 Οκτωβρίου 2009&quot;&gt;Το Βήμα, 18 Οκτωβρίου 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Ambassador Bikas has also been the Director of the Greek Foreign Ministry's Press Office, and Director of the Private Office of President [[Karolos Papoulias]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Το Βήμα, 18 Οκτωβρίου 2009&quot;/&gt; the President is a ceremonial office in Greece, as power is exercised by the Prime Minister, but President Papoulias still remains a respected and influential figure, whose support proved vital for Bikas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Το Βήμα, 18 Οκτωβρίου 2009&quot;/&gt;

The Deputy Director General, responsible for operations, is Police Director Photis Papageorgiou, an officer of the elite Anti-terrorist division of the [[Greek Police]].

==Other Info==
The agency's motto is &quot;''λόγων απορρήτων εκφοράν μη ποιού''&quot; (translated roughly as &quot;do not discuss confidential affairs&quot;), a quote of the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Periander]]. The total number of people working for the agency is unknown and remains classified; the Greek media usually give figures of around 3,000.

It is said that there are not more than two agencies all over the planet, with a larger criminal's database than the N.I.S. of Greece. In addition, the classified informations held by the N.I.S. about criminal hubs, activities and organizations operating throughout the European Union, is the second largest in Europe.
