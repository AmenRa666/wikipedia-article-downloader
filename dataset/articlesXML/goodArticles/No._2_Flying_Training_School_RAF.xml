'''No.2 Flying Training School''' is a Flying Training School (FTS) of the [[Royal Air Force]]. It is part of [[No. 22 Group RAF|No.22 (Training) Group]] that delivers flying training to the UK [[Air Training Corps]]. Its Headquarters is located at Royal Air Force Syerston, Nottinghamshire. The [[Royal Air Force]] Central Gliding School and 25 [[Volunteer Gliding Squadrons]] sit under its command. No.2 FTS is also the operating authority for [[RAF Little Rissington]] and [[RAF Kenley]]. Throughout its history, No.2 FTS has had various roles including being the first military flying school to use jet-powered aircraft throughout pilot training.

==History==

===First formation===
No 2 FTS was first formed in [[No. 3 Group RAF]] on 26 April 1920 from No 31 Training Squadron with a special flight attached to carry out research for the Professor of Aeronautical Services at Cambridge University.  At the end of August 1921 it was transferred to [[No. 1 Group RAF]] but returned to No 3 Group on 1 July 1923. Initially equipped with [[Avro 504]]Ks and Ns for basic training it used [[Airco DH.9A]]s, [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol F2Bs]] and [[Sopwith Snipe]]s for service training, the 504s were eventually replaced by the [[Avro Tutor]] and [[Armstrong Whitworth Siskin]]s and [[Gloster Grebe]]s replaced the Snipes.  The school ceased operations on 29 July 1933 and disbanded on 15 December at [[RAF Digby]], where it had moved on 30 Jun 1924.

===Second formation===
The school reformed on 1 October 1934 in [[No. 23 Group RAF]] at its previous home of Digby, now equipped with Tutors for basic training and [[Hawker Hart]]s and [[Hawker Fury|Furies]] for the service training phase. In 1936 [[Hawker Audax]]es were added and in September 1937 the school moved to [[RAF Brize Norton]] to move it away from the likely area of operations in the event of  a war.  By August 1939, basic flying training was being carrying out at civilian run Elementary and Reserve Flying Training Schools and the FTSs were concentrating on the service flying phase of training and to the end it was equipped with [[T-6 Texan|Harvard]]s and [[Airspeed Oxford]]s.

With the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 the schoolâ€™s title was changed to '''No. 2 Service Flying Training School''' (SFTS) and on 24 June 1940 it was reclassified as a Group II school concentrating on twin engined training with Oxfords.  By 1942 the [[Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] was in full swing and most aircrew were being trained up to SFTS level in Canada, South Africa or Southern Rhodesia before arriving in or returning to Britain so it was decided to convert the SFTSs to (Pilot) or (Observer) Advanced Flying Units.  These units would concentrate in training the personnel arriving from overseas in the techniques and conditions of flying in a blacked-out Northern Europe.  As a result, No 2 SFTS became '''No 2 (Pilots') Advanced Flying Unit''' on 14 March 1942.

===Third formation===
On 23 July 1947 No 20 FTS at [[RAF Church Lawford]] was redesignated No 2 FTS and on 6 April 1948 it moved to [[RAF South Cerney]].  It was equipped with [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]]s and Harvards but in June 1949 the Tiger Moths were replaced by [[Percival Prentice]]s.  However, the school did not last long as it was redesignated [[Central Flying School]] (Basic) on 1 May 1952.

===Fourth &amp; Fifth formations===
As a result of the [[Korean War]] there was an increase in demand for pilots and No 2 FTS reformed on 1 March 1953 at [[RAF Cluntoe]] in Northern Ireland with Prentices and Harvards.  It moved to [[RAF Hullavington]] on 1 June 1954, now equipped with [[Percival Provost]]s and [[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|Chipmunks]] but in 1955 it became the first school in the world to offer ab-initio training on jet aircraft when it introduced the [[BAC Jet Provost]] T Mk 1 to a selected group of students.  The experiment led the way to the introduction of the Jet Provost to all RAF FTSs.  On 18 November 1957 the school moved to [[RAF Syerston]] and in December became No 2 (Basic) FTS until it disbanded on 16 January 1970.  However, the same day the Primary Flying School at [[RAF Church Fenton]] was renamed No 2 FTS.  Equipped with Chipmunks, a [[Scottish Aviation Bulldog|Bulldog]] section was added in 1973 which operated as the [[Royal Navy Elementary Flying Training School]] (RNEFTS).  No 2 FTS disbanded on 2 December 1974, although the RNEFTS transferred to the control of [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAF|No 1 FTS]] at [[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]].

===Sixth formation===
On 31 March 1976 the school was reformed as '''No 2 (Advanced) FTS''' at [[RAF Ternhill]] to give advanced training to helicopter pilots.  On 8 October 1976 it moved to [[RAF Shawbury]] to become No 2 FTS once again and where it took over control of the Central Air Traffic Control School as well as continuing to train helicopter pilots at both basic and advanced levels as well as helicopter crewmen.  On 30 March 1997 No 2 FTS was disbanded and was replaced at Shawbury by the civilian operated [[Defence Helicopter Flying School]] which now trains helicopter pilots for all three British armed services. {{sfn|Lake|1999|p=104}}

==Current use==
It reformed at RAF Syerston on 31 January 2014 to take control of the [[Royal Air Force]]'s [[Volunteer Gliding Squadron]]s and the Central Gliding School from [[No. 3 Flying Training School RAF|No.3 Flying Training School]].  It is commanded by a [[Group captain]] in Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS), the first full-time flying appointment given to an officer of that rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/newsandevents/index.cfm?storyid=0FE9C881-5056-A318-A853B62D34BE97D9|title=New Gliding School Launches for Air Cadets|publisher=Air Cadets|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===

Three months after reforming, all gilding operations were 'paused' due to [[airworthiness]] concerns in April 2014.&lt;ref name=FOI1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/234987/response/585814/attach/4/20140417%20Duty%20Holder%20Advice%20Notice%2086%20O.pdf|title=Duty Holder Advice Notice|work=HQ 2 FTS|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost two years later, on 10 March 2016, the Written statement from the MoD drastically reduced gliding provision within the [[Air Cadet Organisation]].&lt;ref name=Relaunch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-03-10/HCWS605|title=Air Cadet Aviation Relaunch:Written statement - HCWS605|work=MoD|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]'s relaunch was heavily criticised.&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3500365/Young-pilots-grounded-Air-Cadets-halve-flying-volunteer-glider-squadrons.html|title=Would-be pilots grounded as Air Cadets axe half their flying squadrons|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/19/air-cadet-cuts-will-see-more-than-half-of-squadrons-axed/|title=Air cadet cuts will see more than half of squadrons axed|work=Telegraph|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HCOAP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.airpilots.org/file/2294/air-cadet-press-release---march-2016.pdf|title=New funding initiative for Air Cadet aircraft needed|work=The Honourable Company of Air Pilots|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nationwide fleet is to be cut down to 73 Viking TX.1s and 15 Vigilant T.1s, from a former total of 146 aircraft. The units struck through in the following section are to close.&lt;ref name=Relaunch/&gt;

HQ 2 FTS was also been heavily criticised for not communicating the plans to withdraw the Vigilant T.1 from service and the restructuring resulting in closure of many VGSs with its volunteer personnel.&lt;ref name=FOI2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/UKACOGliding|title=Social Media Site|work=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much criticism was also voiced with respect to its retention policy of its volunteer personnel, management of its contracted maintenance organization, failure to achieve Continued Airworthiness Management Organisation approval &lt;ref name=FOItwo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/322701/response/810456/attach/4/20160511%20MAA%2015%20CAMO%200051%201%20Gliders%20CAMO%20Initial%20Approval%20Audit%20Report.pdf|title=Continued Airworthiness Management Organisation Initial Approval Audit Report|work=Military Aviation Authority|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; during two years of non-flying, limited recovery of aircraft, and the approach for acquiring Part Task Trainers with grants from the RAF Charitable Trust.
