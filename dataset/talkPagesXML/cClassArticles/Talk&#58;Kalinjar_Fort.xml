[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalinjar&amp;oldid=204035795 This] is the most recent pre-copy-paste version of the page. Maybe it would be a good idea to revert to it? [[User:Someone the Person|Someone the Person]] ([[User talk:Someone the Person|talk]]) 21:15, 27 August 2008 (UTC)

:I just reverted to it. [[User:Someone the Person|Someone the Person]] ([[User talk:Someone the Person|talk]]) 00:37, 2 September 2008 (UTC)

== Mahmud of Ghazni invasion ==

dear Kansas Bear please note that according to the reference you are providing, Mahmud of Ghazni had invaded Kalinjar but however he didn't conquered or captured this fort. so I would have to undo your edit. you may also search for other citations at Google Books which are saying Mahmud Invaded but could not capture Kalinjar.
actually there's difference between invading and conquering. kind regards. [[User:Rmkop|Rmkop]] ([[User talk:Rmkop|talk]]) 08:35, 20 June 2015 (UTC)

:Please note, the &quot;source&quot; you are using is by Arjun Kumar who is '''not''' an historian. The source I am using is written by an historian and does say, &quot;''Subsequently, in 1023, Mahmud of Ghazni led an expedition to Jejakabhukti that forced Ganda to surrender the fort of Kalinjar''&quot;. More sources written by historians:
* ''History of Medieval India'', by Sunil K. Saxena, &quot;''Lahore, Kalinjar, Gwalior, no battles. &lt;u&gt;Exacts tribute(ie. submits)&lt;/u&gt;.''&quot;
* ''Objects of Translation: Material Culture and Medieval &quot;Hindu-Muslim&quot; Encounter'', by Finbarr Barry Flood, page 80-82.
* ''History Of The Chamar Dynasty : (From 6Th Century A.D. To 12Th Century A.D.)'', by Raj Kumar, page 127, &quot;''In 1022-1023 he[Mahmud] &lt;u&gt;received the submission of Gwalior and Kalinjar&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;br&gt;
:Therefore, I will be restoring this information written by historians. --[[User:Kansas Bear|Kansas Bear]] ([[User talk:Kansas Bear|talk]]) 14:06, 20 June 2015 (UTC)

:Since this &quot;other&quot; editor continues to edit war and not participate in discussion, I will address their &quot;sources&quot; here:
* ''The early rulers of Khajuraho'', Sisirkumar Mitra, states that the ruler of Kalinjar fort &lt;u&gt;paid tribute&lt;/u&gt; and begged for safety. 
* ''Historical Geography of Madhyapradesh from Early Records'', by P. K. Bhattacharyya, states a &quot;friendly relation was established&quot;, quite a simplified version of paying tribute according to the other '''4''' sources!
* ''History of India'', by N. Jayapalan, states Kalinjar was besieged, nothing else. This book appears to be an extremely simplified version of history.
:Taken in total, I see nothing that states Mahmud failed in his siege of Kalinjar, &quot;''In 1023, Mahmud of Ghazni, vigorously tried to capture the Rajput forts of [[Gwalior]] and Kalinjar but failed, later a peace treaty was however made between Rajas and Mahmud.''&quot;
:Therefore, this edit warred version is [[Wikipedia:OR|original research]] and has been removed. I would suggest to the &quot;other&quot; editor that simply using google books to find their opinion of what happened is a poor way to find sources. Considering that Sisirkumar Mitra, appears to be a physicist and the other two authors are also of questionable reliablility. Also, continued edit warring will be reported. --[[User:Kansas Bear|Kansas Bear]] ([[User talk:Kansas Bear|talk]]) 12:49, 21 June 2015 (UTC)

::In '''The early rulers of Khajuraho , Sisirkumar
Mitra, also states that Gwalior and kalinjar remained unconquered'''. ain't u original research?  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2A03:2880:3010:6FF4:FACE:B00C:0:1|2A03:2880:3010:6FF4:FACE:B00C:0:1]] ([[User talk:2A03:2880:3010:6FF4:FACE:B00C:0:1|talk]]) 17:13, 21 June 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:::Guess you missed this part, &quot;'''states that the ruler of Kalinjar fort &lt;u&gt;paid tribute&lt;/u&gt; and begged for safety'''. So you have effectively [[Wikipedia:Cherry|cherry-picked]] what you want the source to say. 
:::How about this form of original research by you, &quot;''History of India'', by N. Jayapalan, states Kalinjar was besieged'' and nothing else, yet you used it to misrepresent '''your''' opinion. 
:::I have 3 sources stating Kalinjar paid a tribute and two that states, &quot;''received the submission of Gwalior and Kalinjar''&quot;. You have nothing but your personal opinion and [[Wikipedia:OR|original research]].  --[[User:Kansas Bear|Kansas Bear]] ([[User talk:Kansas Bear|talk]]) 17:23, 21 June 2015 (UTC)

:::''KHAJURAHO'', Santosh K. Bose, '''East and West''', Vol. 7, No. 2 (JULY 1956), page 169, &quot;''His son, Ganda, the third in succession, however, surrendered the fortress of Kalinjar, the kingdom's capital, to the invaders in 1023 A.D..''&quot;. --[[User:Kansas Bear|Kansas Bear]] ([[User talk:Kansas Bear|talk]]) 17:57, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
:Just a note for RMkop, your latest edit warred version is not by consensus, is original research and clearly POV editing. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources   I have a secondary source, which by the way is to be used over tertiary sources], that states the fortress was surrendered. --[[User:Kansas Bear|Kansas Bear]] ([[User talk:Kansas Bear|talk]]) 19:13, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
:To further address the [[Wikipedia:OR|original research]] inflicted upon the articles by user:RMkop:
:* Mohammad Habib, ''Sultan Mahmud of Ghaznin'', page 48, &quot;''Gwalior was invested.''&quot;. More evidence that Gwalior was taken. --[[User:Kansas Bear|Kansas Bear]] ([[User talk:Kansas Bear|talk]]) 22:39, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
{{outdent}} Are the IP and {{u|Rmkop}} the same person? '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Erpert&lt;/span&gt;''' &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Erpert|blah, blah, blah...]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 04:15, 27 June 2015 (UTC)
:Most assuredly. Both have added the exact same source. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmud_of_Ghazni&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=668744276 Rmkop 10:41, 26 June 2015][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalinjar_Fort&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=668753236  2a03:2880:3010:6ff2:face:b00c:0:1][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faisalabad&amp;diff=668746679&amp;oldid=668743746   2a03:2880:3010:6ff4:face:b00c:0:1 11:09, 26 June 2015]. And all these incarnations of Rmkop's are involved in edit warring over three articles, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], [[Kalinjar Fort]] and [[Faisalabad]]. Judging from the [[Wikipedia:Gaming|gaming of the system]] going on here, I would suspect that Rmkop is a currently blocked user. --[[User:Kansas Bear|Kansas Bear]] ([[User talk:Kansas Bear|talk]]) 04:24, 27 June 2015 (UTC)
::Given that (''and'' that s/he suddenly became quiet after my question), I removed the entry from the [[WP:3O|third opinion noticeboard]].

::::No. A tertiary source should not be used '''unless''' there are no secondary sources. Clearly there are secondary sources, you [[Wikipedia:JDLI|don't like]] what they say; when secondary sources clearly state they submitted and paid tribute. The secondary &quot;sources&quot; you have supplied do not state anything to support your opinion. You have been reverted by 4 editors and clearly do not have consensus for your version. --[[User:Kansas Bear|Kansas Bear]] ([[User talk:Kansas Bear|talk]]) 15:55, 1 July 2015 (UTC)
