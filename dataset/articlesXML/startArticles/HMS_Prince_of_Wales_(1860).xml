'''HMS ''Prince of Wales''''' was one of six 121-gun [[propeller|screw-propelled]] [[first-rate]] [[ship of the line|three-decker line-of-battle ships]] of the [[Royal Navy]].  She was launched on 25 January 1860.

In 1869 she was renamed '''HMS ''Britannia''''' and under that name served at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] as a cadet training ship until 1905.

==History==
The ''Prince of Wales'' was originally a 3,186 ton 120 gun design by [[John Edye]] and [[Isaac Watts (naval architect)|Isaac Watts]] for a modified [[HMS Queen (1839)|''Queen''-class]] sailing line-of-battle ship.  She was laid down at Portsmouth on 10 June 1848, though she was not formally ordered until 29 June, and the design was approved on 28 July 1848.&lt;ref name = Winfield90/&gt;

In 1849, the Royal Navy started ordering screw line-of-battle ships starting with the [[HMS Agamemnon (1852)|''Agamemnon'']].&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Andrew ''Battleships in Transition, the Creation of the Steam Battlefleet 1815-1860''&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that construction of ''Prince of Wales'' was suspended, as screw line-of-battle ships laid down after her, were completed before her. ''Prince of Wales'' was reordered to complete as a 121 gun screw line-of-battle ship on 9 April 1856,&lt;ref name = Winfield90/&gt; conversion work started on 27 October 1856.&lt;ref name = Winfield90/&gt;  Her half-sisters [[HMS Duke of Wellington (1852)|''Duke of Wellington'']] and [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1857)|''Royal Sovereign'']] were lengthened with an extra 23&amp;nbsp;ft amidships and 8&amp;nbsp;ft in the run, and originally it was intended that [[HMS Marlborough (1855)|''Marlborough'']] and ''Prince of Wales'' would be converted to the same plans, but they were further lengthened during construction.&lt;ref name = Winfield182&gt;Lyon, David and Winfield, Rif ''The Sail and Steam Navy List, All the Ships of the Royal Navy 1815-1889'', page 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her engines were 800 nhp Penn&lt;ref name=Lambert127/&gt; two-cylinder (82&amp;nbsp;inch diameter, 4&amp;nbsp;ft stroke) horizontal single expansion trunk engines.&lt;ref name = Winfield183/&gt;

She was launched on 25 January 1860, and did her trials at sea in [[Stokes Bay]] on 31 October 1860 unrigged.  She made an average of 12.569 knots (23.293&amp;nbsp;km/h ).&lt;ref name=Lambert127/&gt;

''Prince of Wales'' was completed towards the end of the unarmoured phase of a naval arms race between Britain and France.  In 1860 the Royal Navy had more wooden steam line-of-battle ships than it needed to man in peacetime.  The Royal Navy's first armoured line-of-battle ship, [[HMS Warrior (1860)|''Warrior'']] was commissioned in 1861.  Unarmoured screw line-of-battle ships were still of value in the early to mid-1860s, and several new screw line-of-battle ships were commissioned in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;For instance the new screw three-decker [[HMS Victoria (1859)|''Victoria'']] was first commissioned in 1864, and the new screw two-deckers [[Duncan class ship of the line (1859)|''Gibraltar'' and ''Duncan'']] were first commissioned in 1863 and 1864 respectively. See Lambert ''Battleships in Transition''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, the ''Prince of Wales''{{'}}s engines were removed so they could be installed in the ironclad [[HMS Repulse (1868)|''Repulse'']].  In 1869 she was renamed ''Britannia'' and began service as a cadet training ship at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], replacing the previous [[HMS Britannia (1820)|''Britannia'']] in that role.&lt;ref name = Winfield183/&gt;  As ''Britannia'', she was a [[hulk (ship)|hulk]], and only had her foremast.&lt;ref&gt;See photograph of ''Britannia'' at the turn of the century on page 127 of Lambert ''Battleships in Transition, the Creation of the Steam Battlefleet 1815-1860''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those starting their naval careers on her were, in 1877, the future Admiral and First Sea Lord [[Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss|Rosslyn Wemyss]], [[Prince Albert Victor]], and his younger brother, the future [[King George V]].

A shore-based college at Dartmouth was opened in September 1905 and this was named [[Britannia Royal Naval College|''Royal Naval College, Dartmouth'']].  The ''Britannia'' training establishment was closed at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Tweedmouth, ''First Lord's Statement explanatory of Navy Estimates, 1906-7'', 26 February 1906, reproduced in ''The Naval Annual 1906'', page 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new [[King Edward VII-class battleship|''King Edward VII''-class battleship]] called [[HMS Britannia (1904)|''Britannia'']] was launched in December 1904.&lt;ref&gt;''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1806-1905'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  The former ''Prince of Wales'' was officially hulked in September 1909, sold to Garnham on 23 September 1914, then resold to [[Hughes Bolckow]] arriving at [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] in July 1916 for breaking up.&lt;ref name = Winfield183/&gt;
