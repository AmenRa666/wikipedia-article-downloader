The '''''USS Maine'' Mast Memorial''' is a [[memorial]] honoring those who died aboard the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1}} on February 15, 1898, after a mysterious explosion destroyed the ship while at anchor in [[Havana Harbor]].  It is located in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], in the United States. The memorial consists of the [[Mast (sailing)|main mast]] of the [[battleship]] set atop a circular concrete burial [[receiving vault]] designed to resemble a battleship turret. The memorial has occasionally been used to hold the remains of important individuals, such as [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian|Lord Lothian]] and [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]].

==The ''Maine'' disaster==
[[File:World98.jpg|thumb|left|Front page of the ''New York World'' newspaper displaying a graphic depicting the destruction of the USS ''Maine''.]]
The ''USS Maine'' was one of several new battleships and other warships built by the [[United States Navy]] after 1884 to modernize the fleet. The ''Maine'' was launched on November 18, 1889, and commissioned on September 17, 1895. She was part of the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] for nearly all of her career.

On January 25, 1898, the ''Maine'' was sent from [[Key West, Florida]], to [[Havana]], Cuba, to protect American citizens and interests during the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. At 9:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time on February 15, an explosion on board ''Maine'' destroyed and sank the ship. More than {{convert|5|ST|MT}} of powder charges in the ship's ammunitions magazine detonated, instantly destroying about {{convert|100|ft|m}} (or one-third) of the bow of the ship. The central third of the ship remained somewhat more intact, but was severely damaged and lacked structural integrity. The last third of the ship at the stern remained completely intact. The burning ''Maine'' rapidly sank. Most of the ''Maine''{{'}}s crew (none of them officers) were sleeping or resting in the enlisted quarters in the forward part of the ship. Eight others died later from their injuries. [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[Charles Dwight Sigsbee]] and all but two of the officers survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axelrod&quot;&gt;Axelrod, p. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Official figures for crew and dead are difficult to determine, and even government sources disagree. The majority of sources say the ship carried 354 crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kachur&quot;&gt;Kachur and Sterngass, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nichols&quot;&gt;Nichols, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HuntColo&quot;&gt;Hunt, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewartjones&quot;&gt;Stewart-Jones, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Youngblood&quot;&gt;Youngblood, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marley907&quot;&gt;Marley, p. 907.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Navarro&quot;&gt;Navarro and Mejia, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keith&quot;&gt;Keith, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice&quot;&gt;Rice, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner&quot;&gt;Gardiner, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paterson&quot;&gt;Paterson, Clifford, and Kagan, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StarrLeBeau&quot;&gt;Starr-LeBeau, Kross, and Allison, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, p. 4; Mack, Connell, and Lovette, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; But crew numbers cited by sources include 327,&lt;ref&gt;Lauderbaugh, p. 1050.&lt;/ref&gt; 328,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cova&quot;&gt;de la Cova, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; 350,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hazen&quot;&gt;Hazen, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Limburg&quot;&gt;Limburg, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drew&quot;&gt;Drew and Snow, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; 355,&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCMaineMast&quot;&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/VisitorInformation/MonumentMemorials/USSMaine.aspx &quot;The ''USS Maine'' Mast Memorial.&quot; Arlington National Cemetery.

Department of the Navy. U.S. Department of Defense. February 6, 1998.] Accessed 2013-05-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of dead is also difficult to determine. Sources claim 252,&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialBurials1912&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PaineWarships&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HumanBonesFounda&quot; /&gt; 260,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hazen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drew&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HeritageCommand&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters277&quot;&gt;Peters, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SadMission&quot;&gt;&quot;Sad Mission of the Texas.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

But even these figures vary. Some sources say just 6&lt;ref name=&quot;HeritageCommand&quot; /&gt; later died of their injuries, while others claim 8 did so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axelrod&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HumanBonesFounda&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 19, a U.S. Navy board of inquiry led by Captain [[William T. Sampson]] concluded that ''Maine'' was destroyed by the explosion of its ammunition magazines. But the board of inquiry were unable to determine what set off the ammunition. Nonetheless, the press and most members of Congress concluded that the ''Maine'' had struck a [[naval mine]] laid by the Spanish. Resolutions declaring war on [[Spain]] were introduced in Congress on March 28 and passed on April 20, initiating the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;Marley, p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt; (Subsequent investigations have suggested that the cause of the explosion was the ignition of [[coal dust]] in the fuel bunker or a fire in the coal bunker, although some have also concluded that the cause was a mine.)

===Recovery and interment of bodies at Colon Cemetery===
[[File:Cristobal Colon 1998.jpg|thumb|Colon Cemetery (seen here in 1998), where many of the dead of the ''Maine'' were buried in 1898.]]
The days following the ''Maine'' disaster were chaotic. Some of the twisted wreckage of the center section and bow jutted high out of the water. At low tide, the decks of the center section of the ship were just under water, while the stern (which angled upward) was slightly out of the water. At high tide, all of the ship except the bow wreckage, the main mast, and the aft-mast was under water. The site of the disaster was quickly but not immediately secured by the [[Spanish Navy]] and Cuban colonial government.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardWreck&quot;&gt;&quot;Guard On Wreck.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 19, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; Souvenir seekers and the well-meaning nonetheless often accessed the wreck. Divers, most of them [[Cubans]], were employed by the United States to bring bodies to the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiversWork&quot;&gt;&quot;Divers At Work.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 20, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OperationsDivers&quot;&gt;&quot;Operations of the Divers.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 21, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces of the ship lay some distance from the wreck, and some items washed ashore days or even weeks later.

Press reports about the dead were often confused. For example, the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reported that the body of engineer Darwin Merritt had been found on February 16, but this was incorrect. The newspaper also incorrectly reported that the body of [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Friend W. Jenkins was recovered on February 16.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;258 of Our Sailors Are Lost.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 17, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Jenkins' body was retrieved from an area near the aft [[torpedo]] tube on March 24.&lt;ref name=&quot;JenkinsFound&quot;&gt;&quot;Lieut. Jenkins' Body Found.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 25, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatHavoc&quot;&gt;&quot;Great Havoc Found in Wreck of Maine.&quot; ''New York Times''. June 16, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; It was sent home to his family in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsFrom0326&quot;&gt;&quot;News From Havana.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 26, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspapers often got names wrong, reporting that an Edison or Tennis was among the dead (when no persons with those first or last names were among the crew).&lt;ref name=&quot;DiversWork&quot; /&gt;

The recovery of bodies was slow. Spanish law required that, in order to avoid the spread of disease, bodies be buried within 24 hours and remain buried for at least five years.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bodies Cannot Be Moved from Havana.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 27, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; Three bodies were caught in the wreckage at the surface. But no one noticed them until February 23 (a full week after the explosion), and by then [[vulture]]s had devoured much of the corpses.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlatesDriven&quot;&gt;&quot;Plates Driven Upward.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 24, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; Although only 19 corpses had been found, the city of Havana held a funeral for the dead. Thousands of people turned out for the [[List of French words and phrases used by English speakers#C|funeral cortege]] and watched as the Spanish military bore the 19 elaborate coffins with great ceremony through the streets to [[Colon Cemetery, Havana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IncidentsFuneral&quot; /&gt; Another 135 bodies were recovered on February 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardWreck&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many bodies sank at first or were snagged underwater on wreckage. But as the bodies decomposed, gas formed inside them—bringing them to the surface.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reported that this included the limbs of about 10 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;IncidentsFuneral&quot;&gt;&quot;Incidents of the Funeral.&quot; ''New York Times''. February 19, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four of them were identifiable. Two of the eight wounded (including Coxswain Alfred J. Holland) died that day as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardWreck&quot; /&gt;

Five more bodies were recovered on February 20, and Ordinary Seaman Frank Fisher died that day of his wounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiversWork&quot; /&gt; Several more bodies were recovered on February 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;OperationsDivers&quot; /&gt; Divers discovered another 20 bodies trapped below the forward hatch of the center section on February 23, but only three were brought to the surface as wreckage prevented the rest from being immediately retrieved. Two more of the wounded died that day as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlatesDriven&quot; /&gt; Another 12 bodies were recovered from near the engine rooms on February 22, all of them dismembered and badly disfigured.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Divers in the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times''. February 23, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; Work to free the bodies below the forward hatch continued on February 22, and was largely successful the following day. All but one was brought to the surface, and that body was too tightly caught in the wreckage to free. Another body rose of its own accord to the surface, and divers reported seeing several bodies trapped in twisted metal or in places where divers could not reach.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Is Slow Work.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 26, 1898; &quot;The Day in Havana.&quot; ''New York Times''. March 1, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 4, a total of 161 bodies had been buried at Colon.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Honoring the Maine's Dead.&quot; ''New York Times''. March 4, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The body of one of the ''Maine''{{'s}} four Japanese mess attendants and another sailor were pulled from the wreck on March 24,&lt;ref name=&quot;JenkinsFound&quot; /&gt; and another six bodies (including that of the muscular Coal Passer John Ziegler) brought to the surface the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsFrom0326&quot; /&gt;

Work on the wreck of the ''Maine'' stopped on April 3, 1898. All divers and tugs were withdrawn from the site, and the recovery of bodies called off. U.S. naval authorities estimated that 75 or 76 bodies still remained undiscovered below.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Abandon the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post''. April 3, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key West burials===
[[File:Key West Cemetery Battleship Maine.jpg|thumb|''Maine'' dead burial plot in City Cemetery, Key West, Florida.]]
Some bodies in Havana were not recovered until the end of February. For reasons which remain unclear, the U.S. Navy transported these remains&lt;!--the ones recovered at the end of Feb.?--&gt; to [[Key West, Florida]], where they were buried. The first burials, of an unreported number of bodies, were made there on March 1 at City Cemetery. The funeral was organized by Captain [[Bowman H. McCalla]] of the {{USS|Marblehead|C-11}}. Small detachments of [[United States Marines|Marines]] from nearby vessels and from [[Fort Jefferson, Florida|Fort Jefferson]] in the nearby [[Dry Tortugas]] provided an [[honor guard]] and guided the [[Limbers and caissons|caissons]] on which the coffins were borne. Guns from the ships fired after the funeral ended.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Funerals at Key West.&quot; ''New York Times''. March 2, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; Six more bodies (including two in a single coffin) arrived on March 8, and were buried in City Cemetery as well.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Six More Victims Buried.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 8, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; Another two unidentified bodies were brought to Key West by the cruiser ''Olivette'' on March 17, and buried on March 18.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Two More Maine Victims.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 17, 1898; &quot;Two Maine Victims Buried.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 18, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of bodies at multiple times at Key West has led to confusion over how many bodies from the ''Maine'' are buried there. The ''New York Times'' did not report the number of dead at Key West, but said only two had been identified.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Removal of the Maine Dead.&quot; ''New York Times''. November 30, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Army Quartermaster Corps]] reported that there were just 19 bodies at Key West.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialBurials1912&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IikSAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Burials%20of%20USS%20Maine%20sailors&amp;pg=PA510#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Report of the Quartermaster General,&quot; p. p. 510–511.] Accessed 2013-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt; But other published sources vary quite widely. The [[National Geographic Society]] reported 22 bodies in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Propert, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of sources cite 24 bodies. In May 1898, the ''Washington Post'' reported 24 bodies buried at Key West. It said two were identified, an African American and a Japanese mess attendant.&lt;ref&gt;It did not name these two individuals. See: &quot;Graves of Maine Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post''. May 11, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the ''[[Associated Press]]'' also that 24 bodies were buried at Key West, of whom seven were identified.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-7JNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wvwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5112%2C1973350 &quot;Navy Opts to Forget USS Maine Memorial in Key West.&quot; Associated Press.

==1899 reburials at Arlington National Cemetery==
[[File:Lying in state of USS Maine dead - Havana Cuba - 1898-02-17.jpg|thumb|left|Dead of the ''Maine'' lying in state in City Hall in Havana, Cuba, about February 17, 1898.]]
The press reported that there were 147 graves at Colon Cemetery,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;At Main Victims' Graves.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 7, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; although since there were believed to be 166 bodies&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadofMaine&quot;&gt;&quot;The Dead of the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post''. November 15, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BringingHomeDead&quot; /&gt; it was also assumed that some coffins contained more than one body. In October 1899, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Charles A. Boutelle]] sponsored successful legislation that appropriated $10,000 to have the U.S. Navy repatriate the bodies buried at Colon Cemetery. Boutelle wanted them reinterred at Arlington National Cemetery near the field where the dead of the [[Siege of Santiago]] were buried.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Will Be Buried At Arlington.&quot; ''Washington Post''. October 22, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Spanish–American War over, Spanish law no longer barred disinterment in Cuba. By mid-November, as plans for the disinterment proceeded, the ''Washington Post'' reported that reburial at Arlington was not yet official.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadofMaine&quot; /&gt;

On November 27, President [[William McKinley]] ordered the ''Maine''{{'s}} sister ship, the ''[[USS Texas (1892)|USS Texas]]'' to proceed to Havana and bring the dead home.&lt;ref name=&quot;SadMission&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Bring Maine Victims Home.&quot; ''New York Times''.

November 29, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Texas'' would return to [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]], where they would be transferred to a special train of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (the C&amp;O) for their trip to [[Rosslyn, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SadMission&quot; /&gt; At Rosslyn, caissons and an honor guard would bring the bodies the short distance to the cemetery, where the coffins would be placed under tents prior to burial.&lt;ref name=&quot;BringingHomeDead&quot; /&gt; McKinley also made Arlington National Cemetery the official resting place for the dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;SadMission&quot; /&gt; The ''Texas'' was anticipated to arrive back in the United States on December 15.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Taking Up the Dead of the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post''. December 9, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; But the ship didn't even depart until December 13,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Battle-Ship Texas Mission.&quot; ''Washington Post''. December 14, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived in Havana on December 17.&lt;ref name=&quot;BringingHomeDead&quot;&gt;&quot;Bringing Home Maine Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post''. December 18, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disinterment of the dead at Colon Cemetery by U.S. naval personnel began on December 17, 1899. There was little ceremony as the wood coffins were brought to the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BringingHomeDead&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadDisinterred&quot;&gt;&quot;Maine Dead Are Disinterred.&quot; ''New York Times''. December 19, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Each grave held from one to 20 caskets. Each body had been packed in [[Lime (material)|lime]] (believed to encourage rapid decomposition of flesh). In some cases, the lime had hardened into a solid cake, requiring the workers to break the body free (which distressed some of the workers). The remains were transferred to tin-lined wood coffins, where they were placed on a bed of lime and [[charcoal]], with more of each substance packed around them before the coffin was sealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadDisinterred&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Texas At Havana.&quot; ''New York Times''. December 18, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

Errors in the original body and coffins counts quickly became apparent. Father John P. Chidwick, the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] chaplain aboard the ''Maine'' at the time of its destruction, had overseen the original interments in February and March 1898.&lt;ref name=&quot;RemovalofDead&quot;&gt;&quot;Removal of Maine's Dead.&quot; ''New York Times''. December 22, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; He now also oversaw the disinterment.&lt;ref name=&quot;BringingHomeDead&quot; /&gt; Chidwick's records showed that there should have been 154 coffins, but only 151 were recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;RemovalofDead&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheirLastTrip&quot;&gt;&quot;Their Last Trip Over.&quot; ''Washington Post''. December 26, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Chidwick's list of the dead showed two unidentified bodies were unaccounted for. Several reasons for the discrepancies were offered: Clerical errors, errors made by the overburdened Chidwick, and more than one body in the same casket.&lt;ref name=&quot;RemovalofDead&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheirLastTrip&quot; /&gt; Chidwick, Colon Cemetery officials, and Cuban authorities were convinced, however, that no bodies had been lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;RemovalofDead&quot; /&gt; Disinterment also revealed a new problem: At the time of burial, identified remains had a number painted on the exterior of the coffin that corresponded with a name on Chidwick's list of dead. But by the time of disinterment, the numbers on many of these coffins were unreadable.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRestNYT&quot;&gt;&quot;Maine Dead at Rest Today.&quot; ''New York Times''. December 28, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Identified remains thus became unidentified. Another problem was the way the dead were buried. As bodies were buried at Colon Cemetery, the row and grave number was supposed to be noted for each casket. Unfortunately, the cemetery superintendent only noted which row each identified body was in—not the actual grave number.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot; /&gt; This, too, made it sometimes impossible to determine in which grave identified remains laid. Some casket numbers were readable, however. Those bodies which still could be identified had their names painted on the exterior of the new coffin.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadDisinterred&quot; /&gt; The old coffins were burned.&lt;ref name=&quot;RemovalofDead&quot; /&gt;

Disinterment ended at 10:00 P.M. local time.&lt;ref name=&quot;RemovalofDead&quot; /&gt; The 151 coffins were taken to Machina Wharf and held under guard overnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;BringingHomeDead&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadDisinterred&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Charles Herbert Allen]] said on December 25, 1898, that there were 166 coffins. Allen clearly meant to say 166 bodies. The ''New York Times'' reported in the same article that there were 151 bodies, when the newspaper meant to say 151 coffins. See: &quot;Maine Dead at Rest Today.&quot; ''New York Times''. December 28, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Early the next morning, the coffins were placed about two small [[steamship]]s, which took the dead at 6:00 A.M. to the ''Texas''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RemovalofDead&quot; /&gt; The coffins were arranged on the ''Texas''{{'s}} afterdeck in groups and covered in canvas. Many American flags and wreaths [[evergreen]]s and artificial flowers were placed on the canvas coverings, and the coffins guarded by U.S. Marines day and night until the ship reached Hampton Roads.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheirLastTrip&quot; /&gt;

The ''Texas'' arrived at Hampton Roads at 11:00 A.M. local time on December 25, 1899. The 151 coffins were offloaded by U.S. Navy personnel and transferred to funeral barges. Bluejackets accompanied each funeral barge until it reached the railroad pier. The bluejackets transferred the coffins from the barges to the waiting train while a Marine honor guard stood watch.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheirLastTrip&quot; /&gt; A unit of six bluejackets and six Marines provided an honor guard aboard the train. Jeremiah Shea, fireman who was aboard the ''Maine'' on its fateful night, was one of the six sailors. Accompanying the sailors and marines were Father Chidwick and a lieutenant from the ''Texas''. The funeral train consisted of four [[Passenger car (rail)#Baggage car|baggage cars]] and a [[Observation car|vestibule car]] with the seats removed. Transferral of the dead from the ''Texas'' to the wharf took much longer than anticipated, although only an hour was needed to load the funeral train. Due to the delays, the train did not depart Hampton Roads until 10:00 P.M. local time on December 26. Expected to arrive at 8:00 A.M. on December 27, it did not do so until 11:00 A.M. Captain Sigsbee did not take the funeral train to Washington, but rather rode a [[steamboat]] up the [[Potomac River]] to reach the city faster.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuneralTrain&quot;&gt;&quot;Maine Funeral Train.&quot; ''Washington Post''. December 27, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

The funeral train reached [[Rosslyn, Virginia]], on December 27. The remains were transferred to wagons, and taken to Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot; /&gt; The funeral cortege include a cavalry unit from [[Fort Myer]], a unit of 25 Marines from the [[Washington Navy Yard]], and a unit of bluejackets (U.S. Navy sailors) from the ''USS Texas''.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuneralTrain&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadInterred&quot;&gt;&quot;The Maine Dead Interred.&quot; ''New York Times''.

December 16, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; placed under tents and an honor guard of Marines protected them overnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TenClaimed&quot; /&gt;

A grassy knoll at Arlington National Cemetery adjacent to the burial field containing the dead of the Santiago campaign was chosen by [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Charles Herbert Allen]] for the reinterment.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;New Graves for Maine Dead.&quot; ''New York Times''. December 12, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of 166 dead&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCMaineMast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historian Steve Vogel claims only 162 remains were buried in December 1898.

See: Peters, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; were contained in the 151 caskets (as only partial remains were found in many cases).&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorsMaineDead&quot;&gt;&quot;Honors for the Maine Dead.&quot; ''New York Times''.

But few remains were identifiable (among them the remains of Frederick C. Holzer).&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot; /&gt; It is unclear just how many of the remains were identifiable, as some sources say only 10&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot; /&gt; and others say 24.&lt;ref name=&quot;TenClaimed&quot;&gt;&quot;Ten of the Dead Claimed.&quot; ''Washington Post''. December 24, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these families were initially promised that they could take their dead home and bury them privately,&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorsMaineDead&quot; /&gt; the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] reluctantly decided not to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot; /&gt; All identifiable remains received a headstone with a name on it, while all other remains were marked &quot;Unknown&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorsMaineDead&quot; /&gt; (Some sources claim that 191 bodies or portions of bodies were recovered, and 73 of these were identifiable.

A wreath of [[galax]] leaves was provided for each casket, which was also draped with an American flag.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadInterred&quot; /&gt; Each coffin was placed next to an open grave.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot;&gt;&quot;Maine's Dead at Rest.&quot; ''Washington Post''. December 29, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the funeral cortege departed, two [[Company (military unit)#United States|companies]] of bluejackets and a [[Battalion#United States Marine Corps|battalion]] of U.S. Marines acted as honor guards for the dead. They were joined by the [[United States Marine Corps Band]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TenClaimed&quot; /&gt; Captain Sigsbee was in command of the three honor guards.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuneralTrain&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadInterred&quot; /&gt; A small dais draped in red, white, and blue was provided for the speakers and officiators.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuneralTrain&quot; /&gt; President McKinley, his [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[George Dewey]], [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Nelson A.

The funeral was largely the same as that used for burying the Santiago campaign's dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrangements&quot; /&gt; [[Protestantism|Protestant]] funeral rites were read first by Chaplain H.H.

It was not until early evening that the coffins were placed in the graves and buried.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot; /&gt;

The War Department had promised the family of Frederick C. Holzer (one of the crewmen who died days after the explosion) that they could have Holzer's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadRest&quot; /&gt; His body turned over to his family and reburied in his home town on [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Sources vary as to whether his body was never buried at Arlington,&lt;ref name=&quot;FuneralTrain&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Holzer's Body Sent to New York.&quot; ''Washington Post''. December 29, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; or was disinterred at some later date and turned over to the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialBurials1912&quot; /&gt;

==The first memorial==
[[File:USS Maine Mast Memorial - Arlington National Cemetery US - pre 1915.jpg|thumb|left|First USS ''Maine'' Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery prior to 1915.]]
There were many attempts to create a national USS ''Maine'' memorial in the wake of the disaster. Citizens in Washington, D.C., began collecting voluntary contributions from members of Congress and wealthy people in society to erect a memorial shaft as early as February 24, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Shaft to Maine Victims.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 25, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; But nothing came of the effort. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Augustus Octavius Bacon]] sponsored legislation to place a bronze memorial tablet in the [[United States Capitol]] shortly thereafter. Although this resolution passed the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tablet to Sailors of the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 2, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; no further action was taken. Senator [[Eugene Hale]] sponsored legislation to have a granite memorial raised in Colon Cemetery in February 1899,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Monument to the Maine Heroes.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 4, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; but this effort, too, failed. An effort was also made in Congress to make the date of the ''Maine''{{'s}} destruction a national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Do Not Make It an Anniversary.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 17, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 1900, the city of Key West dedicated a statue and memorial to the dead of the ''Maine''. This memorial was placed in the &quot;Maine plot&quot; in the City Cemetery where the ''Maine'' dead were buried.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Monument Unveiled.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 16, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first memorial to the ''Maine'' dead was constructed in the first six months of 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarReports&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lr9MAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Maine%20%22Arlington%20National%20Cemetery%22%20anchor&amp;pg=PA300#v=onepage&amp;q=Maine%20%22Arlington%20National%20Cemetery%22%20anchor&amp;f=false ''Annual Reports of the War Department for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1900'', p. 300.] Accessed 2013-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the field of the ''Maine'' dead a concrete base was poured. Two Spanish [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] — taken by Admiral George Dewey from Cavite Arsenal in [[Manila]], The Philippines, at the end of the Spanish–American War—were placed on brick piers on either side of this base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper343&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4rGEAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Maine%20Arlington%20anchor&amp;pg=PA343#v=onepage&amp;q=Maine%20Arlington%20anchor&amp;f=false Pepper, p. 343.] Accessed 2013-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the center of the concrete pad was an anchor. The anchor was manufactured specifically for the site. The {{convert|2|ST|LT|adj=on}} anchor was hand-welded using rough iron to give it a unique look. A slightly worm-eaten wooden crossbar was inserted into the top of the anchor. The crossbar was painted black to protect it, and on the crossbar was a brass tablet was riveted to the crossbar on which was written:&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper343&quot; /&gt;

'The Maine's' Crew Brought From Havana, Cuba.&lt;br&gt;
Reinterred at Arlington, December Twenty-eight, 1899.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The ''Maine'' memorial mimicked a similar memorial of four captured guns erected previously that year in the Santiago campaign burial field.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarReports&quot; /&gt; (These guns formed the basis for the [[Spanish–American War Memorial (Arlington National Cemetery)|Spanish–American War Memorial]], erected in 1902.)

==1912 reburials at Arlington National Cemetery==
The ''Maine'' lay at the bottom of Havana Harbor for many years. The wreck was a hazard to ships, occupied valuable anchorage space, and a dangerous [[shoal]] was building up around it. Additionally, some politicians in Cuba and Spain were suggesting that the reason the United States did not remove the wreck is that it would reveal the &quot;struck by a mine&quot; theory to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LGQ3AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22USS%20Maine%22%20shoal%20Havana&amp;pg=RA7-PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=%22USS%20Maine%22%20shoal%20Havana&amp;f=false Magoon, p. 70-71], accessed 2013-05-17; &quot;Wreck of the Battle-Ship Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' October 23, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempts to raise the ''Maine''===
[[File:Photograph of the wreckage of the USS MAINE - NARA - 301647.jpg|thumb|Wreckage of the USS ''Maine'' in Havana Harbor in 1910. Note the main mast standing nearly upright.]]
Lieutenant General [[Leonard Wood]], Military Governor of Cuba, asked for the wreck of the ''Maine'' to be removed on October 1900.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wants Wreck of Maine removed.&quot; ''New York Times''. October 23, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[John Davis Long]] approved the plan.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Remove Wreck of Maine.&quot; ''New York Times''. October 25, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; A call for proposals was made on November 19,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Asks Bids for Removing Maine Wreck.&quot; ''New York Times''. November 20, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; and five bids were received.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Wreck to be Removed.&quot; ''New York Times''. December 16, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; Chamberlain &amp; Co., of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], agreed to remove the wreck using balloons, hydraulic jacks, and compressed air for nothing in return for 97 percent of the profits on all sales of relics from the wreck (the government would receive the remainder).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bids for Raising the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post''. February 2, 1901; &quot;Will Remove Wreck of the Maine for Nothing.&quot; ''New York Times''. February 2, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; After an on-site inspection, Chamberlain claimed the ship was in one piece.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Raise the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times''. April 27, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; But by April, when the time period for work to begin expired, no construction bond had been posted and no work was done. Chamberlain &amp; Co. defaulted on their contract in July.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Main Still at Harbor Bottom.&quot; ''Washington Post''.

A second effort by the United States to raise the ''Maine'' was proposed in 1902. General Wood reiterated the call for removal of the ''Maine'' in March 1902.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Plan to Raise the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 27, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[William E. Mason]] proposed legislation in May 1902 to raise the ship to determine the true reason for its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Bill to Raise the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times''. May 14, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Mason's bill provided just $50,000 for the project, but that amount proved far too low. Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] introduced a bill the same month providing $1 million to raise the ''Maine'' and repatriate any remains found to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bill to Remove the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times''. May 23, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; But no action was taken on either bill, even though there were published reports in November 1902 that the Cuban guard on the ship had been removed and relic hunters had stripped all the copper from the wreck.&lt;ref&gt;Stanhope, Dorothy. &quot;Relic Hunters Strip Old Maine.&quot; ''New York Times''. November 30, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain, too, wanted the wreck removed, and proposed in March 1903 that their government raise the ''Maine'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Spain Wants Maine Floated.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 11, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; but Cuba declined to give permission.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Remove of Maine Wreck.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 18, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Cuba—desiring to maintain good relations with the U.S. as well as Spain—itself said it would remove the wreck.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Wreck of the Main.&quot; ''New York Times''. March 19, 1903; &quot;Maine Wreck to Be Removed.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 24, 1903; &quot;Wreck of the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post''. April 19, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Few American firms bid on the work, as the use of [[dynamite]] on the wreck was prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Removal of the Maine Wreck.&quot; ''New York Times''. June 2, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial round of bids were rejected,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bid for Raising Maine Rejected.&quot; ''Washington Post''. June 5, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; a contract was signed in June 1904 with both Joseph de Wyckoff (an American industrialist) and the firm R.H.F. Sewell of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine's Hulk to Be Raised.&quot; ''Washington Post''. June 13, 1904. Sewell intended to put the wreck on display in New Orleans. See: &quot;The Maine to Be Raised.&quot; ''New York Times''. December 23, 1903. Salvage firm operator George Richardson of Chicago, Illinois, was originally offered the contract. But although Richardson verbally agreed to do the job, the contract was never signed and the contract offered to the de Wyckoff and Sewell. See: &quot;Time Called on Maine Wreck.&quot; ''New York Times''. March 6, 1904; &quot;Not to Raise the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times''. March 26, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Cuban government was worried that a mine would be found to be the cause of the wreck, its contract with the salvage firms required the wreck to be towed out to sea and sunk.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Opposes Raising the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times''. July 17, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sewell firm asked the U.S. government if it retained any legal interest in the wreck.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Right to Maine Wreck.&quot; ''Washington Post''. July 14, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did de Wyckoff protest the Sewell firm's involvement, but the United States informed all concerned in July 1904 that it retained ownership of the ''Maine'' and would vigorously prosecute anyone interfering with the wreck.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Wreck Dispute.&quot; ''Washington Post''. July 16, 1904; &quot;Right to Raise the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post''. July 19, 1904; &quot;We Will Not Permit Maine Wreck's Removal.&quot; ''New York Times''. July 19, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban effort was quietly canceled.

===New momentum for a ''Maine'' memorial===
After the failed Cuban attempt to raise the ''Maine'', an important suggestion was made regarding a potential memorial. The Boston Seaman's Friend Society, an association of merchant mariners and their supporters, proposed retrieving the ship's main mast and erecting it as a memorial in Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dfcsAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Maine%20Arlington%20cemetery&amp;pg=PR125#v=onepage&amp;q=Maine%20Arlington%20cemetery&amp;f=false &quot;Razees, Or Notes on Naval Matters.&quot; ''The Sea Breeze.'' October 1904, p. 15.] Accessed 2013-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, on the tenth anniversary of the disaster, Representative [[Charles August Sulzer]] introduced legislation requesting the raising of the ''USS Maine'' and the burial of any dead which remained aboard her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anniversary of the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 16, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Victor H. Metcalf]] proposed amending the bill to ensure that the Cuban government was involved in the process and approved of it.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;For Raising the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 27, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; No action was taken on the bill during the first session of the [[60th United States Congress|60th Congress]].

In January 1909, [[Charles E. Magoon]], Governor of Cuba, again asked for the removal of the wreck of the ''Maine.''&lt;ref&gt;The United States had withdrawn from Cuba in 1901, but the United States Congress enacted the [[Platt Amendment]] which required the United States to intervene in Cuban internal affairs under certain circumstances. After a dispute 1906 election led to a nascent civil war, the United States [[United States occupation of Cuba (1906–1909)|invaded Cuba with 5,600 troops]].  Magoon was installed as Governor of Cuba to restore order. The American occupation ended on January 28, 1909. See: &quot;Magoon Says Raise Wreck of Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' January 25, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; The day after Magoon's request, a group of ''Maine'' survivors and their families formed the Maine Memorial Association (also known as the Maine Memorial Society). The association's goals were to annual observe the anniversary of the ship's destruction by holding ceremonies at the ''Maine'' Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery and Havana, and to press for the establishment of a more formal, larger memorial at Arlington. The association elected now-Admiral Charles D. Sigsbee as its president.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Remember Heroes.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

===Passage of ''Maine'' memorial legislation===
Representative Sulzer renewed pressure to pass the ''Maine'' salvage bill on February 16, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sulzer Pleads for Bill.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 17, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] approved an omnibus appropriations bill that authorized the President to call for proposals and provide an estimate for the salvage operation to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sundry Civil Bill.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 20, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; But the [[60th United States Congress|60th Congress]] came to an end without passage of the legislation.

In the second session of the [[61st United States Congress|61st Congress]], Representative [[George A. Loud]] submitted legislation again calling for the raising of the wreck of the ''Maine''. This legislation won widespread support. President [[William Howard Taft]] endorsed the bill on January 11, providing major support for the effort.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Raising the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' January 12, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; At the ''Maine'' memorial services on February 15 in Arlington National Cemetery, Admiral Sigsbee called for repatriation of all bodies and the construction of a larger memorial.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Dead Honored.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 16, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting a few days later, the [[United Spanish War Veterans]] (an association for veterans of the Spanish–American War) passed a resolution demanding the raising of the wreck of the ''Maine'' and bring any remains found home for burial at Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Want Maine Raised.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 21, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Sigsbee then called on February 26 for all veterans groups to unite behind a plan to salvage the wreck, repatriate all remains, and establish a memorial.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Asks Aid for Memorial.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 26, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, a subcommittee of the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Naval Affairs Committee]] favorably reported the Loud bill. The amended legislation called for a contractor to salvage the ''Maine'' and for all bodies found to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;May Raise the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' March 1, 1910; &quot;Favors Raising of Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 1, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The full House of Representatives passed the legislation on March 23, after having amended it to require the Army Corps of Engineers to do the work and for construction of a new memorial featuring the ''Maine''{{'s}} mast at Arlington.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Raise Battleship Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 24, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating passage of the bill, the Maine Memorial Association began raising money to help built the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;For a Maine Monument.&quot; ''New York Times.'' April 24, 1910. This fund-raising effort collapsed in November 1910 due to internal divisions within the association, and Sigsbee resigned as president. See: &quot;Sigsbee Is Hopeful.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' November 7, 1910. The Maine Monument Association merged with the United Spanish War Veterans in early 1911. See: &quot;Societies to Combine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' January 23, 1911; &quot;Veterans Yet May Aid.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 26, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate concurred in the legislation on May 4.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine to Be Raised.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' May 5, 1910; &quot;The Main to Be Raised.&quot; ''New York Times.'' May 5, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 1910, President Taft signs into law the bill titled &quot;Raising of battleship Maine&quot; (Public Law 61-169) which required the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] to raise and remove the wreck of the ''Maine'' from Havana Harbor. The law appropriated $100,000 for this task. The legislation further required that any bodies found be transported to Arlington National Cemetery and interred there. The mast of the ''Maine'' was to be retained and taken to Arlington, where the [[United States Secretary of War]] was required to erect the mast on top of a suitable monument at or near the place where the dead of the ''Maine'' were laid to rest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lGFCAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22USS%20Maine%22%201910&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22USS%20Maine%22%201910&amp;f=false Special Board of Engineer Officers, p. 5], accessed 2013-05-17; &quot;Task to Raise Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

===Preparing to raise the ''Maine''===
[[File:USACE William Murray Black.jpg|thumb|left|Col. William M. Black (depicted here about 1916) led the effort to raise the ''Maine''.]]
The Army Corps of Engineers began working on plans to raise the ''Maine'' in late July 1910.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Raising The Maine A Duty.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' July 28, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;special board of engineers&quot; was appointed from Corps ranks to work on the problem and oversee the project.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Board to Raise the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' July 30, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[William Murray Black|William M. Black]], Lieutenant Colonel H. H. Patrick, and Captain Harley B. Ferguson.&lt;ref name=&quot;SurveyWreck081910&quot;&gt;&quot;To Survey the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' August 30, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President of Cuba]], [[José Miguel Gómez]], promised the full cooperation of his government.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wants the Maine Raised.&quot; ''New York Times.'' June 2, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Corps immediately alerted Congress in May 1910 that the job could not be done for the $100,000 appropriated.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;May Not Raise the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' May 14, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, Congress appropriated $200,000 more, and authorized the Corps to sign contracts for whatever services it needed (without regard to cost).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Raise Wreck of Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' June 18, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the Special Engineering Board decided not to bring the ''Maine'' back to the United States but to sink her at sea.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Plan to Sink Maine Wreck.&quot; ''New York Times.'' August 28, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck would be surveyed before any work began. [[Caisson (engineering)|Caissons]] would then be constructed around the wreck to form a [[cofferdam]], the water pumped out, and any bodies removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;SurveyWreck081910&quot; /&gt;

The Special Board made its first visit to the wreck of the ''Maine'' on September 10, 1910, measuring the site and taking [[Depth sounding|soundings]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Prepare to Raise Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' September 11, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary borings and additional soundings were made the following week, giving the Special Board enough information to make more formal plans for salvaging the wreck.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Begin to Raise the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' September 17, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Maine'' was found to be lying in {{convert|25|ft|m}} of water,&lt;ref name=&quot;TaftApproves&quot; /&gt; and the Corps of Engineers believed that 75 bodies lay within the wreck of the ''Maine''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lGFCAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22USS%20Maine%22%201910&amp;pg=PR15#v=snippet&amp;q=bodies&amp;f=false Special Board of Engineer Officers, p. 7.] Accessed 2013-05-17.&lt;/ref&gt; (Contemporary accounts claim that only 68 bodies were missing.)&lt;ref name=&quot;HumanBonesFounda&quot; /&gt; The first human remains aboard the ''Maine'' were found near the rear cabins on September 22, 1910, while measurements and soundings were taken. Cuban divers examining the wreck discovered the bones, but did not disturb them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bodies Found in the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' September 22, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was immediately clear that the 1898 explosion had done far more damage to the ''Maine'' than previously assumed, and that the ship might not be capable of refloating at all. The caisson plan, however, was nevertheless considered risky. The Special Board sought the approval of President Taft for the caisson plan and the decision to sink the wreck at sea. The work included contracting for local labor wherever possible, but using U.S. Navy ships and [[derrick]]s. Taft gave his approval on October 13. Taft invited Cuba and Spain to name a representative to be on-site during the salvage operation at all times.&lt;ref name=&quot;TaftApproves&quot;&gt;&quot;Taft Approves Plan for Raising Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' October 14, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmytoRaise&quot;&gt;&quot;Army to Raise Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' October 14, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish agreed to observer status.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmytoRaise&quot; /&gt; With the plan approved, the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]] began manufacturing the interlocking [[Deep foundation|steel piles]] to create the caisson walls.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Steel Piles for Raising the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' October 19, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrieval of bodies===
Piles for the caissons began to be driven on December 6, 1910, and the last was in place on March 31, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lGFCAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22USS%20Maine%22%201910&amp;pg=PR32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Special Board of Engineer Officers, p. 12], accessed 2013-05-17; &quot;Last Rites Over the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' February 16, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty caissons were constructed,&lt;ref name=&quot;CautiousWork&quot;&gt;&quot;Cautious Work on Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' June 7, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; with pilings driven {{convert|72|ft|m}} through water, mud and clay. More than {{convert|75000|cuft|m3}} of water was then pumped out of the cofferdam.&lt;ref name=&quot;RaisingMoving&quot;&gt;&quot;Raising the Maine in Moving Pictures.&quot; ''New York Times.'' November 9, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Maine wreckage cph.3b21936.jpg|thumb|left|Looking aft from the stern of the ''Maine'' in late 1911. Note the caissons in place around the wreck, creating the cofferdam.]]
The first human remains (some ribs and small wrist bones), found outside the hull, were brought to the surface on January 3, 1911, by Cuban divers working on the ''Maine.''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Hulk Gives Up Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' January 4, 1911; &quot;Inside Explosion In Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' January 9, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The top of the starboard turret was detected some {{convert|100|ft|m}} from the wreck in late February after piles being driven into the mud and clay of Havana Harbor struck the object. The turret top was raised on March 12,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Turret Top Raised.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 13, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; and a human foot was found adhered to the turret by fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;BonesonTurret&quot;&gt;&quot;Bones on Maine Turret.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 15, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's starboard anchor (one of six she carried) was raised on March 15.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anchor of the Maine Found.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 16, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the caissons finished at the end of March, they were filled with clay, mud, and rock.  Wood platforms were constructed on top of the caissons to support the cranes and derricks to be used to handle the wreck. Once the caissons were filled, water would begin to be drained from inside the cofferdam. Since construction of such a large, deep cofferdam had not been attempted before, the Corps said it would suspend draining from time to time to assess the performance of the caissons and ensure the cofferdam was still secure. The search for bodies, the Army said, would take precedence over anything else aboard the wreck. Filling the cofferdam again (&quot;rewatering&quot;) would not occur until probably the end of December 1911.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hull of the Maine Soon to Be Exposed.&quot; ''New York Times.'' April 10, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scaffolding]] was erected over the stern to facilitate the removal of the [[Mast (sailing)|mizzenmast]] (or aft mast) and deck fittings. These items were stored in a hut constructed on one of the cofferdams or aboard the [[Collier (ship)|collier]] {{USS|Leonidas|AD-7}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;CautiousWork&quot; /&gt; On May 27, 1911, ''Leonidas'' transported the mizzenmast back to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine's Mast a Monument.&quot; ''New York Times.'' May 27, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty additional partial remains were found aboard the wreck on May 3. Consisting mostly of skulls (often partially crushed) and rib bones, the remains were placed in a single coffin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;30 of Maine Dead Found.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' May 4, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 31, water within the cofferdam was down by {{convert|5|ft|m}}, revealing most of the starboard [[quarterdeck]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CautiousWork&quot; /&gt; Some bending of the steel piles used in one of the caissons was seen on May 31.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Soon to See the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' June 1, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Draining was suspended until June 15 to determine the caisson's stability. Once it was determined the caisson was not in danger of rupture, water was drained another {{convert|5|ft|m}}. The Corps said on June 7 it would be three to four weeks before draining was complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;CautiousWork&quot; /&gt;

In early June, the ''Maine''{{'s}} {{convert|10|ST|LT}} fore-mast was retrieved from the wreck, and shipped aboard the [[Ward Line]] commercial passenger ship ''SS Bayamo'' to New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShipsMastNorth&quot;&gt;&quot;Ship Maine's Mast North.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 14, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} mast was broken off near the deck by the explosion, and badly bent and twisted. Heavily rusted and covered in coral on its lower part, the mast was quite brittle after its stay in saltwater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrolysis&quot;&gt;&quot;Electrolysis Fused Steel on Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' June 19, 1911,.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially stored at the U.S. Army's [[East coast of the United States|east coast]] regional headquarters,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Yields Relics.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 19, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; but transferred to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrolysis&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SeaBurial&quot;&gt;&quot;Sea Burial for the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' February 1, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 15, the water level in the caisson was down {{convert|7|ft|m}}. It was now apparent that the bow of the ship had been completely destroyed by the 1898 blast, and most of the central third of the ship was ruined as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatHavoc&quot; /&gt; Although the stern listed seven [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] to port, the central third of the ship only listed four degrees to port. Engineers realized that the hull had broken amidship.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;No Light Yet On Maine Explosion.&quot; ''New York Times.'' June 17, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The Corps of Engineers began to radically revise its plans for refloating the ship, and there was concern that the ship might need to be removed in pieces. With less need to protect the ship from further damage, Corps officials said they would lower the water level down to {{convert|18|to|20|ft|m}} over the next three to four days. This would completely reveal the central section of the ship, while leaving the bow under water.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatHavoc&quot; /&gt;

With no remains found since May 3, the Corps of Engineers began to fear on June 16 that no more bodies would be found.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Is A Shell.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 17, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; In part this was due to the condition of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineWreckedOutside&quot; /&gt; Army engineers told the press that sides of the bow appeared to have blown outward, with the upper deck detaching from the ship.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine's Bow Blown Away.&quot; ''New York Times.'' July 7, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; This caused wreckage to be strewn laterally over Havana Harbor, leaving a large debris field. The explosion was so powerful that the ship's {{convert|100|ST|LT}} forward gun turret landed {{convert|100|ft|m}} away,&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineWreckedOutside&quot;&gt;&quot;Maine Wrecked From Outside.&quot; ''New York Times.'' July 19, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; and the vessel's port and transverse armored bulkheads were buried {{convert|30|ft|m}} into the mud of the harbor floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ManyMaineShells&quot;&gt;&quot;Many Maine Shells Bared.&quot; ''New York Times.'' November 25, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Some armor was never found.&lt;ref name=&quot;OutsideExplosion&quot; /&gt; The bow's upper deck rose into the air, turned upside-down, and landed on the central third of the ''Maine''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrolysis&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BuildingBulkhead&quot;&gt;&quot;Building Bulkhead to Float the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.''

December 9, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; and the bow's keel detached from the ship at frame 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineWreckedOutside&quot; /&gt; What remained of the bow landed at the bottom of Havana Harbor at a 45 degree angle to the rest of the ship, pointing to starboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrolysis&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OutsideExplosion&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BuildingBulkhead&quot; /&gt; The bow keel was bent upward in the middle by about {{convert|30|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineWreckedOutside&quot; /&gt; The inner shell of the ship's double-bottomed hull was thrown upward, and came to rest on top of what remained of the bow. Investigators could not determine if it was forced into that position by an exterior explosion or if it was pulled upward as the bow detached.&lt;ref name=&quot;OutsideExplosion&quot; /&gt; The forward portion of what remained of the keel rested on the inner shell, with the rear portion buried deep in the mud. Again, investigators could not determine if the explosion bent the keel and forced it into this position or if the suction created by the outward-expanding hull pulled it there.&lt;ref name=&quot;OutsideExplosion&quot; /&gt; As the bow settled, it listed almost onto its starboard side.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineWreckedOutside&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OutsideExplosion&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BuildingBulkhead&quot; /&gt; The central third of the ship was devastated by the explosion and collapse of the bow's upper deck onto it, and was partially detached from the stern.&lt;ref name=&quot;HumanBonesFounda&quot;&gt;&quot;Human Bones Found in Wreck of Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' June 20, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrolysis&quot; /&gt; The stern, however, was in remarkably good shape and seemingly undisturbed by the blast. Even the aft turret guns were still in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;RaisingMoving&quot; /&gt; Nonetheless, Corps officials said they were seriously considering breaking up the wreck rather than raising it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrolysis&quot; /&gt; A model of the wreck was made by a naval constructor.&lt;ref name=&quot;OutsideExplosion&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This model was later displayed in the office of the Secretary of the Navy and in the White House.  It was intended for permanent display either in the Naval Museum at the Washington Navy Yard or at the [[National Museum of American History]]. See: &quot;Exhibit Maine Wreck Model.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' December 24, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days later, on June 20, more human remains were found on the upper deck between the aft turret and the engine room. These included two forearms and a foot in a boot.&lt;ref name=&quot;HumanBonesFounda&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Find Bones on Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 20, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; All the remains were heavily charred. Additionally, workers were recovering a very large number of relics such as [[bayonet]]s, [[binoculars]], books, clothing, dishes, and papers (some of them in watertight boxes, and still dry). The water level was now down {{convert|14|ft|m}}, and dropping.&lt;ref name=&quot;HumanBonesFounda&quot; /&gt;

A nearly two-week delay in recovering additional remain occurred in late June and early July as workers struggled to remove mud from the interior of the stern.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Caisson Is Secure.&quot; ''New York Times.'' July 6, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; By July 19, water levels inside the cofferdam were down {{convert|18|ft|m}} (with just {{convert|4|ft|m}} of water left to pump out), but it was clear by then that most of the bow wreckage lay buried in {{convert|37|ft|m}} of mud. The Corps advised that it would take several months to erect all the cranes and derricks needed to remove the heaviest wreckage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineWreckedOutside&quot; /&gt;

Additional remains were soon uncovered.  On July 19, a skull, some jawbone fragments, and several vertebrae were discovered in mud on the main deck. Corps workers believed this represented the remains about three people.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;More Bones From Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' July 20, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; As the last {{convert|4|ft|m}} of water was pumped out and the suction dredges began removing the soft mud around the bow, the remains of four more individuals were found near the [[conning tower]]. These remains were heavily scorched.&lt;ref name=&quot;SearchforBodiesIn&quot;&gt;&quot;Search for Bodies in the Maine Wreck.&quot; ''New York Times.'' July 21, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Will Dissect Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' July 21, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; These discoveries gave the Army hope that more remains might be found. Efforts to remove the mud were redoubled, although Corps engineers said it would take three to four months to clear all the mud and complete a thorough search for the wreck.&lt;ref name=&quot;SearchforBodiesIn&quot; /&gt;

The ship's bell was found in the mud, split in half by the explosion, on July 22, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nfRYAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22USS%20Maine%22%20%22ship's%20bell%22&amp;pg=RA19-PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=%22USS%20Maine%22%20%22ship's%20bell%22&amp;f=false &quot;Work on Exposing the Old U.S.S.

[[File:Caissons around wreck of USS Maine - circa mid 1912.jpg|thumb|left|Caissons form a cofferdam around the wreck of the ''Maine'' in late summer 1912.]]
More remains were found the day after the ship's bell was rediscovered. These represented six or seven crewmen, and were found among the wreckage of the central portion of the ship near the conning tower. The bones were found in a confused mass, scorched by fire, and many were incomplete or fractured. Some were skulls which had portions missing, and many were small fragments. Workers reported that additional remains were wedged tightly in twisted masses of steel, and could not be easily removed without the use of [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting#Acetylene|acetylene torches]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Yields Up Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' July 23, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of another three to four men were found on the central superstructure on July 24. Again, some showed the action of fire.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Gives Up Victims.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' July 25, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

The salvage operation began running out of money in late July.  On July 26, the Corps asked Congress for another $250,000, to bring the total expenditures on the wreck to $900,000. That same day, a nearly intact human skeleton was found on the starboard berth deck in the central section.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cost of Raising the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' July 27, 1911; &quot;14 Dead From the Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

On August 2, a nearly intact skeleton was found in the [[wardroom]] of the ''Maine''. On the basis of clothing, height, and personal effects, the skeleton was identified as that of Assistant Engineer Darwin R. Merritt.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineIdentified&quot; /&gt; His body was placed aboard the battleship {{USS|North Carolina|ACR-12}}, and taken to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The ship arrived on August 12, and Merritt's body turned over to his relatives. His family buried him in a cemetery in [[Red Oak, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Body of Merritt Arrives.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

August 4, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; By August 14, more remains had been found, bringing the total number of full and partial bodies found to 25.  Some skulls still lay wrapped in the wreckage too tightly to retrieve.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine A Sorry Sight.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' August 15, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work to remove the main mast from the wreck began on September 2, 1911.

September 27, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; and six more bodies were located in the engine room on September 28.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;10 More Maine Dead Found.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' September 29, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[boiler]]s were found intact, although the 1898 explosion had driven one through the rear bulkhead to rest against the aft boilers. This led workers to believe that more bodies might be found in the engine room.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Boilers Intact.&quot; ''New York Times.'' October 11, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; But no more bodies were found there.  The last set of remains to be retrieved from the ''USS Maine'' was a single skeleton, found in the wreckage of the bow on October 16, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Yields Another Body.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

[[File:Wreck of USS Maine being towed out of Havana Harbor - 1913-03-16.jpg|thumb|View from the ''USS Osceola'' as the ''Maine'' is towed to its ocean grave on March 16, 1912.]]
The Army Corps of Engineers said its investigation of the wreck of the ''Maine'' would cease at the end of November 1911. The stern section of the ship proved watertight, and a wooden bulkhead was built across the section to allow it to float.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuildingBulkhead&quot; /&gt; Refloating the wreck, sinking it at sea, and removing the caissons would take another $250,000, the Corps said on November 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;RaisingMoving&quot; /&gt; By mid-December the funds had not been appropriated, and working on the ''Maine'' was scheduled to halt.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ask More Funds of House.&quot; ''New York Times.'' December 14, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; When debate on the funds opened on December 16, Representative [[James Robert Mann (Illinois)|James R. Mann]] and Representative [[Thomas U. Sisson]] nearly came to blows when Sisson proposed that parts of the wreck be sold at auction to reduce the costs of the salvage operation. Both Sisson and Representative [[Robert B. Macon]] had also proposed exhibiting the wreck for a fee, but Representative [[John J. Fitzgerald]] (chair of the House Appropriations Committee) said there would be public riots anywhere it appeared. While members of the House disagreed over whether to sell parts of the ''Maine'', they were united in allowing the Secretary of the Navy to donate relics and portions of the hull to any municipality or patriotic organization which asked for them. Additionally, the House voted to give the city of Havana a portion of the wreck for the construction of a memorial.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clash Over Plan to Sell the Maine.&quot; ''New York Times.'' December 17, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the legislation passed. On January 13, the Secretary of the Navy established a two-person panel consisting of Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Burr]] (Army Corps of Engineers) and [[Commander (United States)#Naval rank|Commander]] [[Richard H. Leigh]] (U.S. Navy) to determine which cities and groups should get relics from the wreck.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Distribute Maine Relics.&quot; ''New York Times.'' January 14, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinking of the ''Maine'' occurred on March 16, 1912. About a third of the vessel was wreckage, which was cut into {{convert|0.5|ST|LT}} pieces and then dumped at sea about {{convert|1|mi|km}} from the coast of Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeaBurial&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoontoFloat&quot;&gt;&quot;Soon to Float Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 4, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; The aft, portside turret was given to the people of Havana for use as a memorial.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeaBurial&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoontoFloat&quot; /&gt; But the forward, starboardside turret was buried too deeply in the mud for removal.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeaBurial&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoontoFloat&quot; /&gt; To free the stern from the mud, diggers were forced to go {{convert|5|ft|m}} below the keel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ManyMaineShells&quot; /&gt; [[Seacock]]s were emplaced in the keel of the ship, and jets pumped water below the keel to help loosen the mud's hold on the vessel.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeaBurial&quot; /&gt; Once the stern was free, water was slowly allowed into the cofferdam. When the stern's deck was level with the cofferdam, two of the caissons were removed to give the ''Maine'' access to the harbor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Main's Deck Visible.&quot; ''New York Times.'' February 13, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; After three attempts to free the ''Maine'' from the mud, the ship began floating on February 15.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine Floating To-Morrow.&quot; ''New York Times.'' February 14, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{USS|Osceola|AT-47}}, an armed [[tugboat]], towed the ''Maine'' out of the cofferdam and into the harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;BurialofMaineToday&quot;&gt;&quot;Burial of the Maine Takes Place To-Day.&quot; ''New York Times.'' March 16, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 80,000 Cubans watched as the ''Osceola'' towed the ''USS Maine'' out of Havana harbor. Cannon at the [[La Cabaña]] fortress fired every 30 minutes from 10:00 A.M. until 2:15 PM, after which &quot;minute guns&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Minute guns&quot; are very small cannon, often with a barrel length of about {{convert|1|ft|m}} or so, which were used to announce the quarter-hour and hour in the era before clocks became widespread.&lt;/ref&gt; sounded every 60 seconds until the procession passed. Behind the ''Maine'' followed the battleship ''USS North Carolina'' with the remains of the dead aboard her. Following the ''North Carolina'' were the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Birmingham|CL-2}}, three [[gunboat]]s of the Cuban Navy, and a number of private vessels. The main guns of the ''North Carolina'' fired when the {{convert|1|mi|km}}, {{convert|2|mi|km}}, and {{convert|3|mi|km}} marks were reached. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} out to sea, naval personnel opened the seacocks at about 5:10 P.M. local time.  The ''USS Maine'' sank at 5:30 P.M. as a bugler aboard the ''North Carolina'' sounded taps. The guns of the ''North Carolina'' and the ''Birmingham'' fired once, and the ceremony ended&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineSinkstoGrave&quot;&gt;&quot;The Maine Sinks to Ocean Grave.&quot; ''New York Times.'' March 17, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 2000, a team of Cuban marine scientists and oceanographers from the [[University of South Florida]] College of Marine Science — working with Advanced Digital Communications, a [[Canada|Canadian]] firm — discovered the wreck of the ''USS Maine'' in about {{convert|3770|ft|m}} of water roughly {{convert|3|mi|km}} northeast of Havana Harbor. According to the researchers, during the sinking ceremony and the time it took the wreck to founder, currents pushed the ''Maine'' east until it rested at its present location.

After the ''Maine'' was sunk at sea, the cofferdam was removed. Under an agreement with the Cuban authorities, the Corps dredged the entire area in and around the shipwreck to a depth of {{convert|37.5|ft|m}} to ensure that no material remained in the mud or clay which might present a danger to navigation. A great deal of material was brought up and sunk at sea. Some items, such as the ship's forward gun, were too heavy to raise. Dynamite was used to destroy these items so that they did not project above the seabed. Operations at the site were completed on December 2, 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lGFCAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22USS%20Maine%22%201910&amp;pg=PR6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Special Board of Engineer Officers, p. 8, 35-36], accessed 2013-05-17; &quot;Bow of Maine Blown Up.&quot; ''New York Times.''

===Repatriating the bodies===
Preparations for receiving the bodies of the ''USS Maine'' began in June 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShipsMastNorth&quot; /&gt; Captain James D. Tilford and [[Funeral director|undertaker]] Oliver B. Jenkins of Washington, D.C., took charge of the remains in Havana.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineCaissons&quot;&gt;&quot;Maine Caissons Safe.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 15, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; They were assisted by the ''Maine''{{'s}} former chaplain, Father John Chidwick.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineWreckedOutside&quot; /&gt; Their plan was to place each set of remains in a coffin, which would be kept under guard at the La Cabaña fortress.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorForDead&quot; /&gt; The assumption of many involved in the operation was that the ''USS Leonidas'' would take the remains to the United States (just as it did other relics from the ship).&lt;ref name=&quot;ShipsMastNorth&quot; /&gt; Tilford and Jenkins ordered 25 coffins from the United States, believing that most of the 75 missing bodies had been blown far out into the harbor by the explosion and would not be recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineCaissons&quot; /&gt; (Their assumption was based, in part, on Father Chidwick's testimony that he saw bodies blown as high as {{convert|60|ft|m}} into the air by the explosion.)&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineWreckedOutside&quot; /&gt;

President Gomez ordered all flags in the city to fly at half-mast and the minute guns at La Cabaña and [[Morro Castle (fortress)|Morro Castle]] to fire every 30 seconds every day that dead were brought to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cuba to Honor Maine Dead.&quot; ''New York Times.'' July 8, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USSNorthCarolinaACR12.jpg|thumb|left|The ''USS North Carolina'', which carried the dead of the ''Maine'' home to the United States in 1899.]]
In August 1911, President Taft learned that the collier ''Leonidas'' might be carrying the ''Maine'' dead home to the United States. Believing that this would dishonor the dead, Taft ordered the U.S. Navy to send a battleship to Cuba provide transport instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;BattleshipForDead&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Battleship to Carry Bones.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' August 20, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Taft also directed the Corps of Engineers to assign an officer to oversee the bodies while in transport. Major [[George LeRoy Irwin]] was assigned this duty on August 28.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Honors to Maine Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' August 29, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 1912, the War Department announced tentative plans for bringing the ''Maine''{{'s}} dead to the United States. It said that the battleships ''USS North Carolina'' and the {{USS|Washington|ACR-11}} would bear the bodies, escorted by the cruisers ''USS Birmingham'' and {{USS|Salem|CL-3}} and the salvage ship {{USS|Chesapeake|ID-3395}}.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fleet for Maine Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' January 8, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear by mid February that no further human remains were likely to be found, the War Department scaled back its plans so that the bodies would be borne by the ''USS North Carolina'', with an escort by the ''USS Birmingham''. The ''North Carolina'' would bear the dead to Hampton Roads, at which point the bodies would be placed aboard the ''Birmingham'' and taken to the Washington Navy Yard.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Honor Maine Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 17, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Gomez personally oversaw the honors given to the dead of the ''Maine'' before the bodies left Havana. There were 34 coffins,&lt;ref name=&quot;BurialofMaineToday&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MainesdeadHere&quot;&gt;&quot;Maine's Dead Here.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 21, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; all but one of which contained the remains of two individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadAwait&quot;&gt;&quot;Maine Dead Await Burial.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 22, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadReceive&quot;&gt;&quot;Maine Dead Receive the Nation's Homage.&quot; ''New York Times.'' March 24, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; The coffins were moved from La Cabaña to city hall (the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales) the evening of March 14, where the bodies [[Lying in state|lay in state]] overnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Honorsto&quot;&gt;&quot;Honors to Maine's Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 28, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Public viewing of the remains began at 2:00 P.M. local time on March 15, and ended at 10:00 A.M. on March 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tafttolaud&quot;&gt;&quot;Taft to Laud Maine Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 15, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30,000 paid their respects to the dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;BurialofMaineToday&quot; /&gt; Throughout the day on March 16, cannon at La Cabaña and Morro Castle fired every half hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Honorsto&quot; /&gt;

After the public viewing ended, Cuban Army artillerymen loaded the coffins aboard caissons.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineSinkstoGrave&quot; /&gt; Commander [[Charles Frederick Hughes|Charles F. Hughes]] of the ''Birmingham'' led a contingent of 300 Marines and bluejackets and the ''North Carolina''{{'s}} band escorted the dead to Machina Wharf. Accompanying the funeral cortege were [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[William Herbert Bixby]], Army Corps [[List of United States Army Corps of Engineers Chiefs of Engineers|Chief of Engineers]]; Julio de Cárdenas, Mayor of Havana; [[Alfredo Zayas y Alfonso]], Vice President of Cuba; and members of the Cuban Cabinet. Six U.S. Navy sailors loaded the first coffins a funeral barge, while Cuban military personnel moved the remainder.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineSinkstoGrave&quot; /&gt; The barges took the remains to the ''North Carolina''. As the ''North Carolina'' passed out of the harbor, soldiers of the Cuban Army lined the walls of La Cabaña and Morro Castle and stood at attention while a military band played a funeral dirge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Honorsto&quot; /&gt; Hand-painted [[porcelain]] funeral wreaths, a gift of the Cuban government, were placed on the coffins.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadAwait&quot; /&gt;

===Burying the last of the ''Maine'' dead===
[[File:Maines Last Muster - Harpers Weekly - 1912-03-30.jpg|thumb|Coverage of the burial of the last ''Maine'' dead from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' in 1912.]]
The ''USS North Carolina'' arrived at Hampton Roads at about 4:30 P.M. local time on March 19, 1912. Transferral of the dead took until 7:30 P.M. The crews of six other U.S. Navy warships anchored at Hampton Roads stood at attention on their decks, and the ships flew their flags at half-mast. Two battalions of bluejackets from the ''North Carolina'' joined the ''Birmingham'' as an honor guard.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maine's Dead Here Today.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 20, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Birmingham'' arrived at the Washington Navy Yard at 10:45 A.M. on March 20. At noon, the coffins were removed from ship and taken to the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building|State, War, and Navy Building]], one block east of the [[White House]]. A 200-man cavalry unit from Fort Myer carried the coffins aboard caissons. An honor guard consisting of the Third Battalion of the [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|Third Field Artillery]];&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadReceive&quot; /&gt; a battalion of bluejackets from the ''North Carolina''; a battalion of bluejackets from the ''Birmingham''; a battalion of Marines from [[Norfolk, Virginia]]; 200 Army engineers from [[Fort Washington Park|Fort Washington, Maryland]]; a battalion of Marines from Fort Washington; a battalion of bluejackets from the Washington Navy Yard; a battalion of bluejackets from [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; and 50 members of the [[District of Columbia National Guard|District of Columbia Naval National Guard]] accompanied the dead. The naval band from the {{USS|Mayflower|PY-1}} accompanied the honor guard, playing funeral dirges.&lt;ref name=&quot;NationHonorsDead&quot;&gt;&quot;Nation Honors Dead of Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 24, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Tents were erected on the south side of the State, War, and Navy Building, and the caissons bearing the flag-draped coffins lined up beneath the tents at about 2:00 P.M.&lt;ref name=&quot;MainesdeadHere&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NationHonorsDead&quot; /&gt;

A brief memorial service was held at 2:30 P.M. Congress adjourned for the ceremony, and the entire [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] was present. President Taft was the main speaker. On the dais to his right was [[Antonio Martin-Rivero]], [[List of Cuban ambassadors to the United States|Cuban ambassador to the United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadReceive&quot; /&gt; To Taft's left were [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] Sigsbee and now-Rear Admiral Wainwright.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadReceive&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NationHonorsDead&quot; /&gt; [[United States Naval Academy]] Chaplain G. Livingston Bayard provided the [[invocation]]. Father Chidwick gave a lengthy oration, followed by a short speech by President Taft. The [[Right Reverend]] W.F. Anderson gave the [[benediction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadReceive&quot; /&gt;

The funeral cortege then departed for Arlington National Cemetery for a graveside funeral service. President Taft had ordered full military honors for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;U.S. to Mourn Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 19, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral was held near the anchor which constituted the ''Maine'' Memorial,&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadReceive&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NationHonorsDead&quot; /&gt; and a tent was set up for President Taft and other dignitaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;NationHonorsDead&quot; /&gt; The Marine Corps Band played funeral dirges,&lt;ref name=&quot;NationHonorsDead&quot; /&gt; and Chaplain Bayard read the Episcopal funeral service over the dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadReceive&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NationHonorsDead&quot; /&gt; Maurice Simmons, Commander of the United Spanish War Veterans, gave a brief speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadReceive&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NationHonorsDead&quot; /&gt; Eight United Spanish War Veterans served as honorary pall bearers for the dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadAwait&quot; /&gt; Three Spanish–American War veterans then laid a white rose, a sprig of evergreen, and a small American flag on the coffins. The Fort Myer cavalry unit delivered a 21-gun salute, followed by a taps played by a bugler. The ceremony ended with a 21-gun salute from cannon at nearby Fort Myer.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaineDeadReceive&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NationHonorsDead&quot; /&gt;

Estimates of the number of dead in the burial field around the monument include 229,&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; 230,&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialBurials1912&quot; /&gt; and 232.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Curtain Rung Down on Tragedy That Swept 260 Men to Death on the Ill-Fated Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

==Constructing the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial==
[[File:USS Maine Mast.jpg|thumb|upright|The completed Memorial]]
As work proceeded on salvaging the wreck of the ''USS Maine'', work on the memorial at Arlington National Cemetery also began. Initially, this work was halted in August 1911 by a lack of funds. The U.S. Army said that the bodies and the ''Maine''{{'s}} mast would be stored at Arlington if no funds were appropriated.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Postpone Work on Maine.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' August 30, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Maine''{{'s}} main mast was brought to the United States by the {{USS|Leonidas|AD-7|6}} in March 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoontoFloat&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing Maine's Mast, Naval Collier Leonidas is on the way here|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1912-02-08/ed-1/seq-2/|work=Evening Star (Washington, D.C.)|date=8 February 1912|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Collier on Way to Annapolis with the Maine Relics|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1912-02-01/ed-1/seq-17/|work=The Washington Times|date=1 February 1912|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Maine''{{'s}} foremast was also located, and the {{USS|Sterling|1898|6}} carried it to the U.S. Naval Academy in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maine's Mast at Annapolis|work=The Washington Post|date=August 8, 1912|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Maine Foremast at Annapolis|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1912-08-08/ed-1/seq-4/|work=The Evening Star|date=August 8, 1912|page=4|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Four rejected designs for USS Maine Mast Memorial - Commission of Fine Arts 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Four preliminary designs for the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial which were rejected by the Commission of Fine Arts.]]
Work on the memorial began again in early 1912. Just two years earlier, Congress had established the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]] (CFA), and gave the body the power to advise regarding the siting of monuments and memorials. Given the reputation of the CFA's members (which included some of the most highly regarded architects, painters, landscape architects, sculptors, and other artists of the day) and the strong political support the commission had (particularly from President Taft and the U.S. Senate), the commission's advice was rarely rejected. The CFA reviewed preliminary designs submitted by the War Department, and gave its views on how the memorial should be treated. But no decision was made.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9gYxAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Commission+of+Fine+Arts%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YX2iUf7tBLfe4APt54DABg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commission of Fine Arts, ''Report of the Commission of Fine Arts for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1912'', p. 24.] Accessed 2013-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, the CFA voiced its opinion that the designs submitted were very poor.  The commission advised the War Department to select a designer rather than hold a competition. The CFA recommended promising local architect [[Nathan C. Wyeth]], who designed the [[Russell Senate Office Building]] in 1903 and the [[West Wing]] of the [[White House]] in 1909, including the now-iconic [[Oval Office]]. The Secretary of War agreed, and Wyeth was hired to submit a design.&lt;ref name=&quot;HABSMaine&quot;&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/va1847.sheet.00001a/ ''USS Maine Memorial, Arlington National Cemetery.''

In January 1913, the Corps of Engineers reported that enough funds were left over from salvage of the ''Maine'' to permit construction of the Arlington National Cemetery Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clears Maine Debris.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' January 13, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, shortly before the commemoration ceremonies at the ''Maine'' Memorial at Arlington, President Taft announced his preference for the establishment of the memorial in the field of the ''Maine'' dead rather than another location in the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Honor Maine Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 9, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of War [[Lindley Miller Garrison]] then placed the design project on hold to allow the CFA to consider placement of the memorial in relation to three other projects also approved for construction: The [[Arlington Memorial Bridge]] (which included a new drive to a new ceremonial gateway to the cemetery), [[Arlington Memorial Amphitheater]], and a receiving vault and chapel.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarshipsDepart&quot;&gt;&quot;Warships Depart.&quot; ''New York Times.'' June 1, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission and the Memorial Amphitheater were both approved by Congress on March 4, 1913. Unlike the bridge and amphitheater, the chapel at Arlington National Cemetery was never built.&lt;/ref&gt; After discussions about the proposed location for the memorial, Wyeth submitted three designs to the CFA. In executive session, the commission made a recommendation to the Secretary of War.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9gYxAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Commission+of+Fine+Arts%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YX2iUf7tBLfe4APt54DABg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commission of Fine Arts, ''Report of the Commission of Fine Arts for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1913'', p. 19-20.] Accessed 2013-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Acting Quartermaster General [[Henry Granville Sharpe]] recommended that Secretary of War Garrison accept Wyeth's design, and he did by June 30, 1913.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarshipsDepart&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FrlLAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22USS%20Maine%22%20memorial&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Report of the Chief of the Quartermaster Corps to the Secretary of War, 1913&quot;, p. 11.] Accessed 2013-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the memorial was set at $55,613.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarshipsDepart&quot; /&gt;

In June 1913, the Washington Navy Yard transferred the ''Maine''{{'s}} mast to Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mast of Battleship Maine Will Soon Mark Graves of Sailors Who Died in Habana.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 29, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; As the design process proceeded from preliminary to final designs, Wyeth consults extensively with the CFA.  In the fall of 1913, the commission approved the placement of a small bronze memorial plaque on the mast itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFABronzeShield&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9gYxAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Commission+of+Fine+Arts%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YX2iUf7tBLfe4APt54DABg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commission of Fine Arts, ''Report of the Commission of Fine Arts for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1914'', p. 32-33.] Accessed 2013-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial began in late November 1913.  Wyeth's design featured as a base a mausoleum which vaguely looked like a battleship gun turret. The mast of the ''Maine'' pierced the top of this structure, and was set into the floor below. The design called for an exterior made of tan granite, and an interior lined with white marble. The names of those who died aboard the ''Maine'' were to be inscribed on the exterior of the mausoleum. The granite for the structure came from [[Troy, New Hampshire]], and the marble from [[Danby, Vermont]]. Eight months were originally allotted for construction, largely due to the need to chisel the 8,000 letters into the exterior. The Washington, D.C., firm of Norcross Bros. won the $44,637 contract to construct the memorial. This created some controversy, as Norcross was not the lowest bidder.

Initial work on the memorial proceeded quickly. Memorial services of the ''Maine'' dead were held at the unfinished memorial on February 15, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Flags and Flowers for Graves of Maine Heroes.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 15, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, a joint ceremony sponsored by the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], [[Army and Navy Union of the United States of America|Army and Navy Union]], and United Spanish War Veterans was held to pay tribute to the ''Maine''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maine Dead 1914&quot;&gt;&quot;Honor to Maine Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

Problems in obtaining stone and cost overruns greatly delayed construction of the memorial. By August 1914, the cost of the structure had risen to $60,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorVictimsCompletion&quot;&gt;&quot;Honor Maine Victims.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

===Dedication of the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial===
[[File:Dedication of USS Maine Mast Memorial - Arlington National Cemetery - 1915-02-15.jpg|thumb|Dedication of the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial by President Woodrow Wilson on Memorial Day in 1915.]]
Dedication of the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial occurred on May 30, 1915, as part of larger Memorial Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery. At noon, President Wilson led a march of dignitaries and veterans from the White House to the [[Civil War Unknowns Monument]], where he laid a wreath. Wilson and the dignitaries then proceeded to the [[Old Amphitheater]], where he and others delivered speeches.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForHeroDead&quot;&gt;&quot;Honors For Hero Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' May 16, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 3:00 P.M., a regiment of U.S. Marines escorted President Wilson to the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorToday&quot;&gt;&quot;Honor Heroes Today.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' May 31, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonAt&quot;&gt;&quot;Wilson at Arlington.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 1, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheered&quot;&gt;&quot;Cheered At Arlington.&quot; ''New York Times.'' June 1, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony began with an invocation by Father Chidwick.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForHeroDead&quot; /&gt; Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]] spoke first, followed by Charles Cramer, Commander of United Spanish War Veterans, and H. Oden Lake, National Commander of the Army and Navy Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForHeroDead&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheered&quot; /&gt;

Following the speeches, the American flag was raised to the top of the mast by Frank Arthur Daniels (age 11) and [[Jonathan W. Daniels|Jonathon Worth Daniels]] (age 13), sons of Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels. The Daniels boys were nephews of [[Ensign (rank)#United States|Ensign]] [[Worth Bagley]], the first and only American naval officer to die in the Spanish–American War.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonAt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheered&quot; /&gt; The Daniels boys also raised [[International maritime signal flags|signal flags]] which spelled out &quot;Maine 1915&quot;. A 21-gun salute from cannon at Fort Myer occurred as the flags were raised.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonAt&quot; /&gt; After the flag and signals were up, 50 Marines in [[Uniforms of the United States Navy|dress whites]] climbed into the rigging supporting the mast.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonAt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheered&quot; /&gt; The flag-raising was followed by speeches by [[John McElroy]], Commander of the Department of the Potomac chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic; Major Robert Lee Longstreet, son of [[American Civil War]] [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Lieutenant general|Lieutenant General]] [[James Longstreet]] of the [[Confederate States Army]]; and Dr. [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada]], Cuban ambassador to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonAt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheered&quot; /&gt; Taps were played to end the ceremony. Marines fired a 21-gun salute to President Wilson as the ceremonies ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonAt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheered&quot; /&gt;

After the official dedication ended, several veterans groups held a joint ceremony at the new ''Maine'' Mast Memorial.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorToday&quot; /&gt; Rear Admiral [[George Washington Baird]] (ret.) spoke about the history of the battleship, the ''USS Maine'', and the ship's salvaging.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonAt&quot; /&gt; [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Jennings Bryan]] spoke afterward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheered&quot; /&gt;

On August 14, 1915, Secretary of War Garrison said that the [[Antiquities Act|Antiquities Act of 1906]] encompassed the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial. This required the federal government to care for the monument in perpetuity.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Care For Monuments.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' August 15, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the memorial==
[[File:USS Maine bell on entrance door - USS Maine Mast Memorial - Arlington National Cemetery - 2013-03-15.jpg|thumb|Bell of the ''USS Maine'', broken in half by the 1898 explosion, attached to the door of the memorial at Arlington National Cemetery.]]
The ''Maine'' Mast Memorial is located on Sigsbee Drive in Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Holt. p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; The monument is due west of [[Arlington Memorial Amphitheater]].&lt;ref&gt;Lemos, et al., p. 250-251.&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial consists of the main mast of the ''USS Maine'' set upright into the center of a circular, stylized mausoleum shaped to look like a battleship gun turret.&lt;ref name=&quot;HABSMaine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonAt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheered&quot; /&gt; The structure is {{convert|90|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|15|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorVictimsCompletion&quot; /&gt; The mast pierces the roof the memorial, and is sunk into the floor inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorVictimsCompletion&quot; /&gt; The mausoleum is constructed of [[reinforced concrete]], sheathed in tan granite on the outside and white marble on the interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;HABSMaine&quot; /&gt; The names and ranks of those who died aboard the ''Maine'' are carved into the exterior of the mausoleum,&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorVictimsCompletion&quot; /&gt; organized into 23 panels.&lt;ref name=&quot;HABSMaine&quot; /&gt; There are eleven slit windows with bronze grills in the structure.  The interior roof is a shallow dome, and the interior floor is lined with mosaic tile.&lt;ref name=&quot;HABSMaine&quot; /&gt; The single entry to the mausoleum has two doors. The inner door is made of wood, and half the ship's bell (retrieved from the ocean floor in 1911) is attached to the outer side of this door.&lt;ref name=&quot;HABSMaine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AshesLothian&quot;&gt;&quot;Ashes of Lord Lothian Rest in Arlington.&quot; ''New York Times.'' December 17, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The outer door is a bronze gate decorated with metal rope and anchors.&lt;ref name=&quot;HABSMaine&quot; /&gt; Ceremonial stone funeral urns stand on either side of the entryway.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorVictimsCompletion&quot; /&gt; Above the door is carved the following: &quot;Erected in memory of the officers and men who lost their lives in the destruction of the U.S.S.

A road encircles the memorial. On the east side of the memorial is a concrete pad on which the anchor manufactured in 1900 sits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper343&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HABSMaine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At least two of the ''Maine''{{'s}} anchors are accounted for.  One anchor was given to the United Spanish War Veterans, who melted it down and made insignia for its members. See: Piehler, p. 90-91. The other anchor is in City Park in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. Representative [[John Hoover Rothermel|John H. Rothermel]] used political connections to obtain the anchor from the Washington Navy Yard, which had possession of it. The anchor was dedicated on August 1, 1914, by then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in front of a crowd of about 13,000 people. See: Blow, p. 447; [http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=101544 Cuyler, Greta. &quot;Group Recalls Dedication of Anchor from U.S. Warship in Reading's City Park.&quot; ''Reading Eagle.''

But when the anchor and mortars were incorporated into the new memorial, two granite [[balustrade]]s were added along the roadway near the mortars.&lt;ref name=&quot;HABSMaine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorVictimsCompletion&quot; /&gt;

A bronze shield was affixed to the mast by the Havana chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] while it was still in Havana.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonAt&quot; /&gt; This shield was retained when the mast was erected in 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFABronzeShield&quot; /&gt;

The memorial's 100th anniversary was celebrated on May 30, 2015. Dave Kammen, Director of Events and Ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery, presided over a wreath-laying ceremony at the memorial. A U.S. Navy honor guard assisted in observing the event, at which &quot;[[Taps]]&quot; was played.

===Changes to the memorial===
In 1962, a [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] was constructed for the anchor and mortars. The terrace is paved with [[Bluestone#In the United States and Canada|bluestone]] flagstones, and bluestone also replaced the concrete pad on which the anchor rested.&lt;ref name=&quot;HABSMaine&quot; /&gt;

Minor repairs were made to the memorial in 1917 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ylJAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Maine%20memorial%22%20Arlington%20repair&amp;pg=PA1825#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Report of the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army, 1917&quot;, p. 1825], accessed 2013-05-27; National Capital Planning Commission, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial underwent a $500,000 partial restoration in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the ''USS Maine'' Mast Memorial began undergoing a complete restoration. The two-phase project began in September 2012 and is anticipated to be complete by Memorial Day in 2014. The first phase of the project will document the memorial's construction history, physical characteristics, and areas in need of renovation. Conservation recommendations will be part of this phase. The second phase of the project will involve conserving, restoring, and renovating the mast, the mast rigging, the terrace, and the approaches to the memorial. The goal of the second phase will be to restore to the memorial as much as possible to its original condition. This includes restoring damage, replacing lost pieces or parts, and eliminating alterations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/News/NewsItem.aspx?ID=6613c314-0b46-44f9-86c5-2c8156ebe886 Bohan, Melissa. &quot;Restoration Ongoing for Mast of the Maine; Upcoming for JFK Flame.&quot; Public Affairs Office.

===Lord Lothian===
Beginning in 1939, [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian]] was [[List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to the United States|British ambassador to the United States]]. Lord Lothian died unexpectedly in December 1940. His remains were cremated, but with the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] making sea travel risky and air travel limited to only items of the highest importance, the [[United Kingdom]] agreed that Lord Lothian's ashes should remain in the United States until such time as they might be safely conveyed across the Atlantic.  His ashes were interred in the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial on December 15, 1940, after a funeral at the [[Washington National Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AshesLothian&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, Harold B. &quot;Ashes of Lothian Going to Arlington.&quot; ''New York Times.''

Lord Lothian's ashes were returned to the United Kingdom aboard an American naval vessel in December 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ignacy Jan Paderewski===
In 1940, the internationally known pianist and composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] was named head of the [[Polish National Council]], a Polish [[Sejm|parliament]] in exile in [[London]]. He traveled extensively in the United States, building public support for the Polish people (who were under [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] rule). Paderewski fell ill on June 27, 1941, while on a speaking tour in America. The 80-year-old diplomat was diagnosed with [[pneumonia]], and died in [[New York City]] on June 29. His body was temporarily interred in the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial on July 5, 1941, with the stipulation of the Polish National Council that they would be returned only to a free Poland.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Paderewski Rests With Heroes of U.S.&quot; ''United Press International.'' July 6, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[John F. Kennedy]] dedicated a plaque on the interior of the memorial in May 1963, honoring Paderewski's memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;PaderHome&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/25/arts/paderewski-to-go-home-51-years-after-his-death.html Kozinn, Allan. &quot;Paderewski to Go Home, 51 Years After His Death.&quot; ''New York Times.''

===Manuel Quezon===
[[Manuel Quezon]] was elected [[President of the Philippines]] for a second term on November 11, 1941. Just 27 days later, the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded the [[Philippines]] in what became known as the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–1942)|Philippines Campaign]]. On March 27, 1942, Quezon and his government fled the Philippines as the final American and Filipino defensive lines neared collapse.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Quezon Joins MacArthur in Australia With Staff.&quot; ''Associated Press.''

His body was placed in the ''Maine'' Mast Memorial until it could be returned to a liberated Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Gurney and Wise, p. 78; Goettel, p. 207; Pabico, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
