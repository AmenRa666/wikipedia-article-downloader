'''''Puglia''''' was a [[protected cruiser]] of the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy). She was the last of six {{sclass2-|Regioni|cruiser|0}} ships, all of which were named for regions of Italy. She was built in Taranto between October 1893 and May 1901, when she was commissioned into the fleet. The ship was equipped with a main armament of four {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} and six {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}} guns, and she could steam at a speed of {{convert|20|kn}}.

''Puglia'' served abroad for much of her early career, including periods in South American and East Asian waters. She saw action in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1911&amp;ndash;12, primarily in the [[Red Sea]]. During the war she bombarded Ottoman ports in Arabia and assisted in enforcing a blockade on maritime traffic in the area. She was still in service during [[World War I]]; the only action in which she participated was the evacuation of units from the [[Serbian Army]] from [[Durazzo]] in February 1916. During the evacuation, she bombarded the pursuing [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. After the war, ''Puglia'' was involved in the occupation of the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, and in 1920 her captain was murdered in a violent confrontation in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] with Croatian nationalists. The old cruiser was sold for [[ship breaking|scrapping]] in 1923, but much of her bow was preserved at the [[Vittoriale degli italiani]] museum.

==Design==
{{main|Regioni-class cruiser}}

''Puglia'' was slightly larger than her [[sister ship]]s. {{convert|88.25|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|12.13|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.45|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced up to {{convert|3110|MT|sp=us}} at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical [[triple-expansion engine]]s, with steam supplied by four cylindrical [[water-tube boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=G349&gt;Gardiner, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; ''Puglia'' was capable of steaming at a top speed of {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; The ship had a cruising radius of about {{convert|2100|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. She had a crew of between 213&amp;ndash;78.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt;

''Puglia'' was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns mounted singly, with two side by side forward and two side by side aft. Six {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns were placed between them, with three on each [[broadside]]. Light armament included eight {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} guns, eight {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and a pair of [[machine gun]]s. She was also equipped with two {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. ''Puglia'' was protected by a {{convert|25|mm|abbr=on}} thick deck, unlike her sisters which all had decks twice as thick. Her [[conning tower]] had 50&amp;nbsp;mm thick sides.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt;

==Service history==
''Puglia'' was built by the new ''Regia Marina'' shipyard in [[Taranto]], the first major warship to be built there. Her keel was laid down in October 1893, and she was launched on 22 September 1898. [[Fitting-out]] work proved to be a lengthy process, and she was not ready for service until 26 May 1901. By this time, her design was over ten years old and the ship was rapidly becoming obsolescent;&lt;ref name=G34950&gt;Gardiner, pp. 349&amp;ndash;350&lt;/ref&gt; in comparison, Germany had already commissioned the world's first [[light cruiser]]s, the {{sclass-|Gazelle|cruiser|4}}, which were significantly faster and better armed. This new type of ship rapidly replaced protected cruisers like ''Puglia''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimons, p. 1764&lt;/ref&gt;

''Puglia'' was immediately deployed to East Asian waters following her commissioning. In July, she was in Australia during the visit of the British [[George V|Prince George]], son of then-King [[Edward VI]].&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Impressions of Western Australia'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was still on the China station as of 1904.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Naval Notes&quot;, p. 1429&lt;/ref&gt; ''Puglia'' was present in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in January 1908 when the [[Great White Fleet]] arrived in the port. She greeted the American fleet with a [[21-gun salute|15-gun salute]]. The German cruiser {{SMS|Bremen}} was also moored in the harbor at the time, as was the Brazilian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italo-Turkish War===
At the outbreak of [[Italo-Turkish War]] in September 1911, ''Puglia'' was stationed in eastern Africa, where Italy had colonies in [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland|Somaliland]]. She was joined there by her sisters {{ship|Italian cruiser|Elba|||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Liguria||2}} and the cruisers {{ship|Italian cruiser|Piemonte||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Etna||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; ''Puglia'' and the cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Calabria||2}}, which had recently arrived from Asian waters, bombarded the Turkish port of [[Aqaba]] on 19 November to disperse a contingent of Ottoman soldiers there. Hostilities were temporarily ceased while the British King [[George V]] passed through the [[Red Sea]] following his coronation ceremony in [[India]]&amp;mdash;the ceasefire lasted until 26 November.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, pp. 47&amp;ndash;48&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1912, the Italian Red Sea fleet searched for a group of seven Ottoman gunboats thought to be planning an attack on Eritrea, though they were in fact immobilized due to a lack of coal. ''Puglia'' and ''Calabria'' carried out diversionary bombardments against [[Jebl Tahr]], and [[Al Luḩayyah]], while ''Piemonte'' and the destroyers {{ship|Italian destroyer|Artigliere|1907|2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Garibaldino|1910|2}} searched for the gunboats. On 7 January, they found the gunboats and quickly sank four in the [[Battle of Kunfuda Bay]]; the other three were forced to beach to avoid sinking as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;brassey12 p&amp;nbsp;166–7&quot;&gt;Hythe 1912, pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=B51&gt;Beehler, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; ''Puglia'' and the rest of the Italian ships returned to bombarding the Turkish ports in the Red Sea before declaring a [[blockade]] of the city of [[Al Hudaydah]] on 26 January.&lt;ref name=B51/&gt; The cruiser fleet in the Red Sea then began a campaign of coastal bombardments of Ottoman ports in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; A blockade was proclaimed of the Ottoman ports, which included  Al Luḩayyah and Al Hudaydah.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans eventually agreed to surrender in October, ending the war.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===

{{details|Adriatic Campaign of World War I}}

Italy declared neutrality at the start of [[World War I]], but by July 1915, the [[Triple Entente]] had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral [[Paolo Thaon di Revel]], the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian [[submarine]]s could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 141&amp;ndash;142&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest ''Puglia'' came to engaging a hostile vessel came on 27 January 1915, when while patrolling off [[Durazzo]], she encountered the Austro-Hungarian scout cruiser {{SMS|Novara|1913|2}}, but the Austro-Hungarian ship retreated without either vessel firing a shot.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; In late February 1916, ''Puglia'' and the cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Libia||2}} covered the withdrawal of elements of the [[Serbian Army]] from Durazzo. The Austro-Hungarian Army was pursuing the retreating Serbians, and ''Puglia'' provided gunfire support to delay the Austro-Hungarian advance.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; She was converted into a [[minelayer]] later that year. She entered service in this role on 1 July, and she remained on active duty through the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=G34950/&gt;

After the war, ''Puglia'' had been assigned to patrol the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. On 11 July 1920, men from the ship became involved in the [[1918–20 unrest in Split|unrest in Split]]. During a violent confrontation with a group of Croats, the ship's captain and a sailor were shot and killed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Contemporary Review'', p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; ''Puglia'' was sold for scrapping on 22 March 1923.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt; While the ship was being dismantled, the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] donated the ship's bow section to the writer and ardent nationalist [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], who had it installed at his estate as part of the [[Vittoriale degli italiani]] museum.&lt;ref&gt;Domenico, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
