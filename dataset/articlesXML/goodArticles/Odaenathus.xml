'''Septimius Udaynath''', Latinized as '''Odaenathus''' '''('''[[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]]: [[File:Dynt.png|55x55px]] ({{transl|syc|''''Dynt'''}}), spelled '''Oḏainaṯ'''; {{lang-ar|'''أذينة'''}} ({{transl|ar|'''Udhaynah'''}}); c.220–267''')''', was the founder king ([[Malik|Mlk]]) of the Palmyrene Kingdom centered at [[Palmyra]], [[Syria]]. He lifted his city from the position of a regional center subordinate to Rome into the supreme power in the [[Syria (region)#Syria 2|East]]. Odaenathus was born into an aristocratic Palmyrene family who had received [[Roman citizenship]] in the 190s under the [[Severan dynasty]]. He was the son of Hairan the descendant of Nasor. The circumstances surrounding his rise are ambiguous; he became the lord (Ras) of the city, a position created for him, as early as the 240s and by 258, he was styled a ''[[consularis]]'', indicating a high status in the [[Roman Empire]].

The defeat and captivity of emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] at the hands of the Persian [[Sassanian]] monarch [[Shapur I]] in 260 left the eastern Roman provinces largely at the mercy of the [[Persia]]ns. Odaenathus stayed on the side of Rome; assuming the title of king, he led the [[Palmyrene army]] and fell upon the Persians before they could cross the [[Euphrates]] to the eastern bank, and inflicted upon them a considerable defeat. Then, Odaenathus took the side of emperor [[Gallienus]], the son and successor of Valerian, who was facing the usurpation of [[Fulvius Macrianus]]. The rebel declared his sons emperors, leaving one in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and taking the other with him to Europe. Odaenathus attacked the remaining usurper and quelled the rebellion. He was rewarded many exceptional titles by the emperor who formalized his self-established position in the East. In reality, the emperor could have done little but to accept the declared nominal loyalty of Odaenathus.

In a series of rapid and successful campaigns starting in 262, he crossed the Euphrates and recovered [[Carrhae]] and [[Nisibis]]. He then took the offensive to the heartland of Persia, and arrived at the walls of its capital [[Ctesiphon]]. The city withstood the short siege but Odaenathus reclaimed the entirety of Roman lands occupied by the Persians since the beginning of their [[Siege of Nisibis (252)|invasions in 252]]. Odaenathus celebrated his victories and declared himself [[King of Kings]], crowning his son [[Hairan I]] as co-king. By 263, Odaenathus was in effective control of the [[Levant]], [[Upper Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[Anatolia]]'s eastern region.

Odaenathus observed all due formalities towards the emperor, but in practice ruled as an independent monarch. In 266, the king launched a second invasion of Persia but had to abandon the campaign and head north to [[Bithynia]] to repel the attacks of Germanic riders besieging the city of [[Heraclea Pontica]]. He was assassinated in 267 during or immediately after the Anatolian campaign, together with Hairan. The identities of the perpetrator or the instigator are unknown and many stories, accusations and speculations exist in ancient sources. He was succeeded by his son [[Vaballathus]] under the regency of his widow [[Zenobia]], who used the power established by Odaenathus to forge the [[Palmyrene Empire]] in 270.

===Odaenathus I===
In the [[Temple of Bel]] at Palmyra, a stone block with a sepulchral inscription was found mentioning the building of a tomb and recording the genealogy of the builder: Odaenathus son of Hairan son of Wahb Allat son of Nasor.&lt;ref name=&quot;blok&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Q-mEnEfnVNUC&amp;pg=PA166|title=Damascus and Palmyra: a journey to the East, Volume 2|author=Charles Greenstreet Addison|page= 166|year= 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ros&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=dz3d7ymB1f4C&amp;pg=PA68|title=The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars (AD 226-363): A Documentary History|author1=Michael H.

Prior to the 1980s, the earliest known inscription attesting king Odaenathus was dated to 257, leading traditional scholarship to believe that Hairan Ras of Palmyra is the father of the king and that Odaenathus I was his grandfather.{{#tag:ref|[[William Waddington#Archaeological research|William Waddington]] considered king Odaenathus the son of Ras Hairan while [[Theodor Mommsen]] considered the latter an older brother of the king.&lt;ref name=&quot;govo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=i4VLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|title=Studies in the History of the Roman Province of Syria|author= Gustave Adolphus Harrer|page= 59|year= 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=&quot;camv&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alar&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=kJ2JAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|title=Aurelian and the Third Century|author=Alaric Watson|page= 29|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an inscription published in 1985 by archaeologist [[Michael Gawlikowski]] and dated to 252 mentions king Odaenathus as a &quot;Ras&quot; and records the same genealogy found in the sepulchral inscription confirming the name of king Odaenathus' grandfather as Wahb Allat.&lt;ref name=&quot;camv&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ros2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nrza5&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=8kLFfE1qPhIC&amp;pg=PA78|title=Palmyra and Its Empire: Zenobia's Revolt Against Rome|author=  Richard Stoneman|page= 78|year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefor, it is certain that king Odaenathus is the builder of the tomb ruling out the existence of &quot;Odaenathus I&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;camv&quot; /&gt; Ras Hairan mentioned in the 251 inscription is identical with Odaenathus' elder son and co-ruler prince [[Hairan I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;camv&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9y7nTpFcN3AC&amp;pg=PA352|title=The Middle East Under Rome|author= [[Maurice Sartre]]|page= 352|year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Persian campaign 262====
[[File:Odaenathus the Victorious.png|thumb|Mosaic of the tiger; it represent Odaenathus' victory over the Persians who are depicted as tigers.]]

Once at Ctesiphon, Odaenathus immediately began [[Battle of Ctesiphon (263)|the siege]] of the well-fortified winter residence of the Persian kings; severe damage was inflicted upon the surrounding areas due to the battles with Persian troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;nas5o&quot; /&gt; The city held its ground and the logistical problems of fighting in enemy's land probably prompted the Palmyrenes to lift the siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;nas5o&quot; /&gt; Odaenathus headed north along the Euphrates carrying with him numerous prisoners and booty.&lt;ref name=&quot;nas5o&quot; /&gt; The invasion resulted in the full restoration of the Roman lands ([[Osroene (Roman province)|Osroene]] and Mesopotamia provinces) occupied by Shapur since the beginning of his invasions in 252.{{#tag:ref|Contrary to the account of the Augustan History, there is no proof that Odaenathus occupied [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=BdcHK8Ll1jMC&amp;pg=PA174|title=Das palmyrenische Teilreich|author=  Udo Hartmann|page= 174|language= de|year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=&quot;lpoi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fddddddd&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-jUAMmMS5cC&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Policy of the Emperor Gallienus|author= Lukas De Blois|page= 3|year= 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dura-Europus and other Palmyrene posts south of [[Circesium]], such as Anah, were not rebuilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;bosha&quot; /&gt; Odaenathus sent the captives to Rome and by the end of 263, Gallienus added ''Persicus Maximus'' (&quot;The great victor in Persia&quot;) to his titles and held a [[Roman triumph|triumph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=DqMrR29Cc7MC&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Empress Zenobia: Palmyra s Rebel Queen|author=Pat Southern|page= 71|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relation with Rome====
[[File:Hairan I.jpg|thumb|Hairan I wearing the Palmyrene crown]]

Odaenathus' intents are questioned by some historians such as Drinkwater who attribute the attempted negotiations with Shapur to Odaenathus' quest for power.&lt;ref name=&quot;atempt&quot; /&gt; However, in contrast to the norm of his period when powerful generals proclaimed themselves emperors, Odaenathus chose not to usurp Gallienus' throne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Dk2FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA298|title=A History of Rome Under the Emperors|author= Theodor Mommsen|page= 298|year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and minted no coins bearing his own image.{{#tag:ref|[[Hubertus Goltzius]] forged coins of Odaenathus in the 16th century;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Jq6CJqB-qmAC&amp;pg=PA63|title=Fasti Romani|author= Henry Fynes Clinton|page= 63|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Joseph Hilarius Eckhel]] &quot;The coins of Odenathus are known only to Goltzius; and if any one will put faith in their existence, let him go to the fountain head (i.e. Goltzius)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;krespar&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.forumancientcoins.com/Dictionary_Of_Roman_Coins/dictionaryByPage.asp?page=583|title=A Dictionary of Roman Coins, Republican and Imperial|author1=Seth William Stevenson |author2=Frederic William Madden |page= 583|year= 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the  Augustan History, Gallienus minted a coin in honor of Odaenathus where he was depicted leading the Persians captive; the existence of this coin is doubtful.&lt;ref name=&quot;krespar&quot; /&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mtqn&quot; /&gt; The king had total control over his kingdom of Palmyra and effective control over the Roman East where his military authority was absolute.&lt;ref name=&quot;korshar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;worl&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=bpd3tBPN4v8C&amp;pg=PA171|title=Imperial Rome AD 193 to 284: The Critical Century|author= Clifford Ando|page= 171|year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odaenathus respected Gallienus' privilege to appoint provincial governors,&lt;ref name=&quot;worl&quot; /&gt; but dealt swiftly with opposition; the [[:de:Anonymus post Dionem|Anonymus post Dionem]] mention the story of [[Kyrinus]] (Quirinus), a Roman official, who showed dissatisfaction with Odaenathus' authority over the Persian frontier and was immediately executed by the king.{{#tag:ref|No information on the identity of Kyrinus exist;&lt;ref name=&quot;qrq&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=BdcHK8Ll1jMC&amp;pg=PA156|title=Das palmyrenische Teilreich|author= Udo Hartmann|page= 156|year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible that he is the same as Aurelius Quirinius, who is recorded as head of the financial administration of Egypt in 262.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=gE8RAQAAMAAJ&amp;q|title=The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 12|author1=S.

In general, Odaenathus' actions were connected to his and Palmyra's interests only; his support of Gallienus and his Roman titles did not hide the Palmyrene base of his power and the local origin of his armies, as with his decision not to wait for the emperor to help in 260.&lt;ref name=&quot;uta&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bolo56&quot; /&gt; Odaenathus' status seems to have been, as Watson put it, &quot;something between powerful subject, independent vassal king and rival emperor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bolo56&quot; /&gt;

====Administration====
[[File:Odaenathus Kingdom.png|thumb|Roman regions under the authority of Odaenathus (yellow) and the Palmyrene kingdom (green)]]

====Anatolian campaign====
The Romans used the designation &quot;[[Scythian]]&quot; to denote many tribes regardless of ethnic origin and sometimes the term would be interchangeable with [[Goths]]; the tribes attacking Anatolia were probably the [[Heruli]] who built ships to cross the [[Black Sea]] in 267 and ravaged the coasts of [[Bithynia]]-[[Pontus]] besieging [[Heraclea Pontica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anol&quot; /&gt; According to [[George Syncellus|Syncellus]], Odaenathus arrived at Anatolia with Hairan I and headed to Heraclea but the riders were already gone.&lt;ref name=&quot;anol&quot; /&gt; They loaded the spoils onto their ships but many perished in a sea battle probably conducted by Odaenathus; another possibility is that they were shipwrecked.&lt;ref name=&quot;anol&quot; /&gt;

Odaenathus was assassinated along with Hairan I in late 267; the date is debated and some scholars propose 266 or 268, but Vaballathus dated his first year of reign between August 267 and August 268, making late 267 the most probable date.&lt;ref name=&quot;galop&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=wnTOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77|title= Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen|author= Pat Southern|page= 77|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination took place either in Anatolia,&lt;ref name=&quot;galop2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=wnTOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|title= Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen|author= Pat Southern|page= 78|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in Syria while the king was returning to Palmyra;&lt;ref name=&quot;vaji&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzOGycVVQLEC&amp;pg=PA398#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Coinage and History of the Roman Empire, C. 82 B.C.--A.D. 480: History|author= David L.

===Assassination theories===
* Roman conspiracy: [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John Antiochenus]] accuse Gallienus of the assassination.&lt;ref name=&quot;lobra58&quot; /&gt; An interesting passage in the work of the Anonymus post Dionem speaks of a certain &quot;Rufinus&quot; who orchestrated the assassination on his own initiative then explained his act to the emperor who condoned the crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;galop2&quot; /&gt; This story talks about Rufinus ordering the murder of an older Odaenathus out of fear that he would rebel, and has the younger Odaenathus complaining to the emperor.{{#tag:ref|This story gave rise to the now defunct assumption that Odaenathus I existed.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpo&quot; /&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=&quot;lobra58&quot; /&gt; Since the older Odaenathus (Odaenathus I) was proved to be a fictional character, the story was neglected by most scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;bojo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=8kLFfE1qPhIC&amp;pg=PA108|title=Palmyra and Its Empire: Zenobia's Revolt Against Rome|author=Richard Stoneman|page= 108|year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Theodor Mommsen]], younger Odaenathus is an oblique reference to Vaballathus;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=tgCKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA371|title=The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars (AD 226-363): A Documentary History|author1=Michael H. Dodgeon |author2=Samuel N. C. Lieu |page= 371|year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rufinus should be identified with [[Cocceius Rufinus]], the Roman governor of [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]] between 261/262.&lt;ref name=&quot;bojo&quot; /&gt; The evidence for a Roman conspiracy is very weak and can not be confirmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;bojo&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Maeonius.jpg|thumb|alt=Bearded relative of Odaenathus, wearing a metal hat|Maeonius as depicted in the ''[[Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]]'']]
*Family feud: According to Zonaras, Odaenathus' nephew misbehaved during a lion hunt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gzu&quot; /&gt; he made the first attack and killed the animal to the dismay of the king.&lt;ref name=&quot;lobra&quot; /&gt; Odaenathus warned the nephew who ignored the warning and repeated the act twice causing the king to deprive him of his horse which is a great insult in the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;lobra&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;torbov&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=q8Z7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292|title=Ancient Syria: A Three Thousand Year History|author=  Trevor Bryce|page= 292|year= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nephew threatened Odaenathus and was put in chains as a result; Hairan I asked his father to forgive his cousin and his request was granted but as the king was drinking, the nephew approached him with a sword and killed him along with Hairan I.&lt;ref name=&quot;lobra&quot; /&gt; The bodyguard immediately executed the nephew.&lt;ref name=&quot;lobra&quot; /&gt;
* Zenobia: the wife of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having formerly conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson and she could not accept that he was the heir to her husband instead of her own children.&lt;ref name=&quot;lobra58&quot; /&gt; However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder;&lt;ref name=&quot;torbov&quot; /&gt; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy.&lt;ref name=&quot;lobra58&quot; /&gt; Those accounts by the Augustan History can be dismissed as fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;alar56&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=kJ2JAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|title=Aurelian and the Third Century|author= Alaric Watson|page= 58|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can be dismissed as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.&lt;ref name=&quot;galop2&quot; /&gt;
* Persian agents or Palmyrene traitors: the possibility of a Persian involvement exists but the outcome of the assassination would not have served Shapur without establishing a pro-Persian monarch on the Palmyrene throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=wnTOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79|title=Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen|author= Pat Southern|page= 79|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility would be Palmyrenes dissatisfied with Odaenathus' reign and the changes of their city's governmental system.&lt;ref name=&quot;torbov&quot; /&gt;

==Personal life and succession==
[[File:ZENOBIA - RIC V 2 - 80000750.jpg|thumb|Zenobia, Odaenathus' second wife]]
Odaenathus was married twice; nothing is known about his first wife's name or fate.&lt;ref name=&quot;trev596&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=wnTOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|title=Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen|author=Pat Southern|page= 8|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zenobia]] was the king's second wife whom he married in the late 250s when she was 17 or 18 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;trev796&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=wnTOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|title=Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen|author=Pat Southern|page= 4|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of children Odaenathus had with his first wife is unknown and only one is attested:
*[[Hairan I]]: the name appears on a 251 inscription from Palmyra describing him as Ras implying that he was already an adult by then.&lt;ref name=&quot;trev596&quot; /&gt; In the Augustan History, Odaenathus' eldest son is named Herod; the inscription at Palmyra dating to 263 celebrating Hairan's coronation mentions him with the name Herodianus.&lt;ref name=&quot;trev596&quot; /&gt; It is possible that Hairan of the 251 inscription is not the same as Herodianus of the 263,&lt;ref name=&quot;trev596&quot; /&gt; but this is contested by Hartmann who conclude that the reason for the difference in the spelling is due to the language used in the inscription (Herodianus being the Greek version),&lt;ref name=&quot;alar56&quot; /&gt; meaning that Odaenathus' eldest son and co-king is Hairan Herodianus.&lt;ref name=&quot;trev7986&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=wnTOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|title=Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen|author=Pat Southern|page= 9|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antoninian Vaballathus Augustus.jpg|thumb|Vaballathus, Odaenathus' son and successor]]
The children of Odaenathus and Zenobia are:

*[[Harian II]]: his image appear on a seal impression along with his older brother Vaballathus as the sons of Zenobia; his identity is much debated.&lt;ref name=&quot;trev13986&quot; /&gt; Potter suggest that he is the same as Herodianus who was crowned in 263 and that Hairan I mentioned in 251 died before the birth of Hairan II.&lt;ref name=&quot;galz8&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=hGuGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT585|title= The Roman Empire at Bay, AD 180–395|author= David S Potter|page= 628|year= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible descendants of Odaenathus living in later centuries are reported; &quot;Lucia Septimia Patabiniana Balbilla Tyria Nepotilla Odaenathiana&quot; is known through a dedication dating to the late third or early fourth century inscribed on a tombstone erected by a wet nurse to her &quot;sweetest and most loving mistress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=8kLFfE1qPhIC&amp;pg=PA187|title=Palmyra and Its Empire: Zenobia's Revolt Against Rome|author=Richard Stoneman|page= 187|year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tombstone was found in Rome at the [[San Callisto]] in [[Trastevere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=DvrQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q|title=Wanderings in the Roman campagna|author=Rodolfo Amedeo Lanciani|page= 169|year= 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible relative is &quot;Eusebius&quot; who is mentioned by [[Libanius]] in 391 as a son of an &quot;Odaenathus&quot; who was in turn a descendant from the king;&lt;ref name=&quot;solp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=tgCKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110|title= The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars AD 226-363: A Documentary History|author1=Michael H.

The memory of Odaenathus was highly esteemed in the Roman empire; the Augustan History, written in the fourth century, places Odaenathus among the [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)|Thirty Tyrants]] (probably because he assumed the title of king).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=V9cwAQAAMAAJ&amp;q|title=History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume 5|author= Edward Gibbon|page= 498|year= 1788}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it speaks highly of his role in the Persian war and credit him with saving the empire: &quot;Had not Odaenathus, prince of the Palmyrenes, seized the imperial power after the capture of Valerian when the strength of the Roman state was exhausted, all would have been lost in the East&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=tgCKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|title=The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars AD 226-363: A Documentary History|author1=Michael H.
