The '''Life Guards''' (LG) is the senior regiment of the [[British Army]] and part of the [[Household Cavalry]], along with the [[Blues and Royals]].

==History==
The Life Guards grew from the four [[troop]]s of [[Horse Guards Regiment|Horse Guards]] (exclusively formed of [[Gentleman ranker|gentlemen-troopers]] until the transformation of the last two remaining troops into Regiments of Life Guards in 1788)&lt;ref&gt;Magnæ Britanniæ Notitia (1716) p. 115f.: ''Of the Troops of the Household''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia britannica]], Vol. 8 (1797), p. 171: ''Horse Guards''&lt;/ref&gt; raised by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] around the time of his [[English Restoration|restoration]], plus two troops of [[Horse Grenadier Guards]] (rank and file composed of commoners),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Tincey | first1=John | first2=Gerry | last2=Embleton | title=The British Army 1660-1704 | publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] | location=Great Britain | year=1994 | page=43 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SJbsv8TEqAC&amp;pg=PA43 | accessdate=2008-06-05 | isbn=978-1-85532-381-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were raised some years later.&lt;ref name=white&gt;White-Spunner, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[1st Troop of Horse Guards|first troop]] was originally raised in [[Bruges]] in 1658 as ''His Majesty's Own Troop of Horse Guards''. They formed part of the contingent raised by the exiled King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as his contribution to the army of King [[Philip IV of Spain]] who were fighting the French and their allies the [[English Commonwealth]] under the [[Lord Protector]] [[Oliver Cromwell]] in the [[Fronde|Franco-Spanish War]] and the concurrent [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654)|Anglo-Spanish War]].
* The [[2nd Troop of Horse Guards|second troop]] was originally founded in 1659 as ''[[George Monck|Monck's]] Life Guards''.
* The [[3rd Troop of Horse Guards|third troop]], like the first troop was formed in 1658 from exiled Royalists and was initially known as ''The [[James II of England|Duke of York's]] Troop of Horse Guards''.
* The [[4th Troop of Horse Guards|fourth troop]] was raised in 1661 in England.
* The [[Horse Grenadier Guards#Captains &amp; Colonels, 1st Troop, Horse Grenadier Guards|first troop]] of horse grenadier guards was formed in 1693 from the amalgamation of three troops of [[grenadier]]s.
* The [[Horse Grenadier Guards#Captains &amp; Colonels, 2nd Troop (Scots), Horse Grenadier Guards|second troop]] of horse grenadier guards was raised in Scotland in 1702.

These units first saw action during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1672 and then at the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]] during the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] in 1685.&lt;ref name=mod&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/28088.aspx|title=The Life Guards|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd and 4th troops were disbanded in 1746.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; In 1788, the remaining 1st and 2nd troops, along with the two troops of Horse Grenadier Guards, were reorganised into two regiments, the [[1st Regiment of Life Guards|1st]] and [[2nd Regiment of Life Guards|2nd Regiments of Life Guards]] (from 1877, simply '''1st Life Guards''' and '''2nd Life Guards''').&lt;ref name=white/&gt; From then on (1788), rank and file were mostly formed of commoners (pejorative nickname:&quot;cheesemongers&quot;).,&lt;ref&gt;Slang Dictionaries (2014), edited by John Camden Hotten, Francis Grose, Ambrose Bierce&lt;/ref&gt; the bulk of the gentlemen-troopers were pensioned off.&lt;ref&gt;The statutes at large from the Magna Charta, to the end of the eleventh Parliament of Great Britain, anno 1761 [continued to 1806]. By Danby Pickering (1762); Vol. 36 (London, 1788), p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815 they were part of [[1st Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|The Household Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] under Major-General [[Lord Edward Somerset]].&lt;ref name=mod/&gt;

In late 1918, after much service in the [[First World War]], the two regiments gave up their horses and were re-roled as machine gun battalions, becoming the 1st and 2nd Battalions, [[Guards Machine Gun Regiment]]. They reverted to their previous names and roles after the end of the war.&lt;ref name=mod/&gt; In 1922, the two regiments were merged into one regiment, the '''The Life Guards (1st and 2nd)'''.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; In 1928, it was re-designated '''The Life Guards'''.&lt;ref name=mod/&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], the Life Guards took part in the [[Normandy landings]] and the advance through France to liberate [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name=mod/&gt;

In 1992, as part of the [[Options for Change]] defence review, The Life Guards were joined together with the [[Blues and Royals]] in a 'Union' – not an amalgamation – forming the [[Household Cavalry Regiment]] (armoured reconnaissance) and the [[Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment]] (ceremonial duties). However, they maintain their regimental identity, with distinct uniforms and traditions, and their own [[colonel#Colonel of the Regiment|colonel]].&lt;ref name=mod/&gt;

In common with the [[Blues and Royals]], they have a peculiar non-commissioned rank structure: In brief, they lack [[sergeant]]s, replacing them with multiple grades of corporal.)&lt;ref&gt;White-Spunner, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

On ceremonial occasions the Life Guards wear a scarlet tunic, a metal [[cuirass]] and a matching helmet with a white [[Hackle|plume]] worn bound on the top into an 'onion' shape; the exceptions to this are the regiment's trumpeters, who wear a red plume, and farriers, who wear blue tunics and have a black plume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trooping-the-colour.co.uk/trooping/mounted.htm |title=The Rank Past of the Mounted Guards |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Trooping the Colour |publisher= |access-date=15 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Life Guards wear their chin strap below their lower lip, as opposed to the [[Blues and Royals]] who wear it under their chin.
