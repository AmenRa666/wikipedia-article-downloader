==Fair use rationale for Image:HMAS Sydney (SMH 290851).jpg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:HMAS Sydney (SMH 290851).jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:HMAS Sydney (SMH 290851).jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;

== Helicopters in Korea ==
I've recently been told by an on-board witness the the USN helicopter used in Korea was a substitute for the intended Westland build aircraft.  The Westland aircraft had suffered from blade de-lamination, and was unfit for service.  Is this an item that people think should be mentioned in the article?  I can undoubtedly obtain more details if required.

:If you can find some [[WP:RS|reliable, published sources]] making these claims, by all means add them or list the information here. If we can't work them into the article as it stands now (balance, undue weight, etc), I'd happily consider it for the massive expansion of the article I have in the works. -- [[User:Saberwyn|saberwyn]] 23:20, 31 August 2008 (UTC)

== Australian War Memorial images ==
While undergoing the rewrite of this article, I trawled through the Australian War Memorial image archives, and found several images of use. They are listed below, with the relevant image number(s) indicated in brackets. I have not had an opportunity to download these and upload them to Commons yet...if anyone beats me to some or all of them, I will not complain. -- [[User:Saberwyn|saberwyn]] 09:59, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

== Studded with numbers ==
Quite an impressive expansion! A suggestion, though: consider balancing the verifiability benefits of having notes after every single sentence against readability. Right now, the article has a massive redundancy of notes, particularly when the same note is repeated in several consecutive sentences.

[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:02, 25 August 2009 (UTC)
:Thanks for your compliment and suggestion. However, I'm of the stance that every fact is contestible, so every fact should be blatantly cited. It aids in verification (as you mentioned), and in vandalism detection (in an article where every sentance is meant to be cited, a sentance without a cite raises an instant red flag). -- [[User:Saberwyn|saberwyn]] 09:30, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

::Do as you will, but keep in mind that this forest of footnotes will never stop vandalism because that's not what it's intended to do. That issue is properly dealt with through careful reviewing and vandal patrols. Footnotes are there to actually be read, not quantified by drive-by reviewers. Any halfwit POV-warrior or joker can insert whatever disinformation they want next to a footnote or within a footnoted sentence. You need to actually check the information behind the citation for it to be useful, and that makes this type of reference density utterly pointless.
::All requirements need to be balanced, and the &quot;every-sentence-is-guilty-until-proven-innocent&quot;-stance isn't even stipulated by policy. Hell, it's not even required by the latest FAs. The only thing this achieves is to put off all but the most dedicated readers.

There are some images from the State Library of Queensland in [[:commons:Category:Sydney (ship)]] that need identification.
