'''No. 91 (Composite) Wing''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] that operated during the [[Korean War]] and its immediate aftermath. It was established in October 1950 to administer RAAF units deployed in the conflict: [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 (Fighter) Squadron]], flying [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s; No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Flight, flying [[Auster]]s and [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]]; [[No. 391 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;391 (Base) Squadron]]; and [[No. 491 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;491 (Maintenance) Squadron]]. The wing was headquartered at [[Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni|Iwakuni]], Japan, as were its subordinate units with the exception of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, which was based in Korea and came under the operational control of the United States [[Fifth Air Force]].

No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Flight was re-designated No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit in November 1950, and [[No. 30 Transport Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30 Transport Unit]] a year later, before re-forming as [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;36 (Transport) Squadron]] in March 1953. It undertook medical evacuation, cargo and troop transport, and courier flights. No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron converted to [[Gloster Meteor]] jets between April and July 1951, and operated primarily in the ground attack role from December that year. It remained in Korea on garrison duty following the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|July 1953 armistice]], and returned to Australia in November 1954; No.&amp;nbsp;491 Squadron disbanded the same month. No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron returned to Australia in March 1955, leaving four aircraft to equip the newly formed [[RAAF Transport Flight (Japan)]], which briefly came under No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing's control. The following month, No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron and No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing headquarters were disbanded.

==History==
===Origins and formation===
When the [[Korean War]] broke out on 25&amp;nbsp;June 1950, [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 (Fighter) Squadron]] of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) was based at [[Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni|Iwakuni]], Japan. For the previous four years, equipped mainly with [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s, it had served with the British Commonwealth Air Group, the air component of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF), initially as part of [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing RAAF]]. No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing was disbanded in November 1948, leaving No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron as Australia's sole air unit in Japan. It was now the largest squadron in the RAAF, comprising 299 officers and men, forty Mustangs, three [[CAC Wirraway]]s, two [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]] and two [[Auster]]s. The squadron was preparing to return to Australia when it was placed on standby for action over Korea; it began flying missions as part of the [[United Nations]] (UN) peacekeeping force a week later.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 210, 222–225&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's commanding officer, [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Lou Spence, was killed in action on 9&amp;nbsp;September 1950, and Air Commodore [[Alan Charlesworth]], Chief of Staff at BCOF, temporarily took charge at Iwakuni, pending the formation of an overarching organisation for support and administration at the base. [[Squadron Leader]] [[Dick Cresswell]] arrived on 17&amp;nbsp;September to assume command of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Korean314&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', pp. 314–315&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Battle of Inchon|landing at Inchon]] and the northward advance of UN troops, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron relocated to [[Pohang Airport|Pohang]], South Korea, on 12&amp;nbsp;October 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt; It left its main support elements at Iwakuni.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;91 (Composite) Wing was established at the base on 20&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;ref name=Korean314/&gt;&lt;ref name=Solo228&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 228–229&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;composite&quot; referred to an RAAF formation made up of disparate operational elements, rather than one comprising a single type such as bombers or fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''The Private Air Marshal'', pp. 224, 338&lt;/ref&gt; Commanded by [[Group Captain]] A.D. (Dallas) Charlton, No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing was given administrative responsibility for all RAAF units operating during the Korean War.&lt;ref name=Solo228/&gt;&lt;ref name=APDC91WG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=404|title=No 91 (Composite) Wing formed in Japan|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, this included the newly formed [[No. 391 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;391 (Base) Squadron]] and [[No. 491 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;491 (Maintenance) Squadron]], and No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Flight, formerly the No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron Communications Flight and initially comprising its two Dakotas and two Austers.&lt;ref name=Solo228/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson170&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, the wing's units were all headquartered at Iwakuni.&lt;ref name=Solo228/&gt; Some members of the US [[Far East Air Forces]] command favoured the establishment of a British Commonwealth Wing, to include No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron and the Mustang-equipped [[2 Squadron SAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron]] of the [[South African Air Force]], then en route to Korea, but the South African government vetoed the idea.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operations===
[[File:No. 77 Squadron Meteors in flight 1952 (AWM JK0242 cropped).jpg |thumb|right|upright=1.38|No. 77 Squadron Meteors practise manoeuvres during a training exercise over Iwakuni, Japan, 1952.|alt=Three twin-jet military aircraft in flight]]
No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's tasking was controlled by the United States [[Fifth Air Force]] from the time it commenced operations in Korea, and this arrangement was not affected by the formation of No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; It moved forward from Pohang to [[Yonpo Airfield|Yonpo]], near [[Hamhung]], in November 1950, continuing its support of UN forces as they advanced up the peninsula. North Korea's counter-attack, augmented by Chinese forces, led to the squadron being hurriedly withdrawn to [[Busan|Pusan]] on 3&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 228, 231&lt;/ref&gt; Poor radio communications with No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing dogged the evacuation from Yonpo, which was effected through US Air Force support supplementing the efforts of RAAF Dakotas.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 105, 147&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell believed that the Iwakuni-based wing headquarters was not always in tune with frontline requirements, and he often dealt directly with Lieutenant General [[Horace Robertson|Sir Horace Robertson]], BCOF commander and the theatre's senior Australian officer, and the RAAF's [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice Marshal [[Frederick Scherger]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 73, 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the threat of communist [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] jet fighters, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron was withdrawn to Iwakuni in April 1951, to re-equip with [[Gloster Meteor]]s. Four [[Royal Air Force]] officers with Meteor experience were seconded to No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing to assist with training.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 229–231&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron returned to action with its new aircraft on 29&amp;nbsp;July, operating out of [[Gimpo International Airport|Kimpo]], South Korea. The Mustangs had been highly effective in [[close air support|close support]], but No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's main role in the RAAF was interception, and it was expected that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties.&lt;ref name=Solo234&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 234–238&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Australia in the Korean War 1950–53|official history of Australia in the Korean War]], the unit proved its value diplomatically as well as operationally: having been one of the first UN squadrons to go into action, it comprised one-third of the jet fighter force in the latter part of 1951, when clashes in &quot;[[MiG Alley]]&quot; were at their height.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', pp. 408–409&lt;/ref&gt; However, dogfights between Meteors and MiGs that August convinced the new commanding officer, Wing Commander [[Gordon Steege]], that the Australian jets were outmatched, and Fifth Air Force agreed to take them out of an offensive air-to-air combat role in favour of escort duties and local air defence.&lt;ref name=Solo234/&gt; The squadron's loss rate by the end of the year was one in four killed or captured.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in December 1951 under Steege's replacement, Wing Commander Ron Susans, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron again took up an offensive role, namely ground attack, which constituted its primary tasking for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=Solo234/&gt; [[Flight Lieutenant]] J.C. Smith, No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing's armament officer, played a key role in developing &quot;Flaming Onion&quot;, [[napalm]]-tipped air-to-ground rockets that were used in several operations in 1952 and 1953.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron remained in Korea on garrison duty—initially at Kimpo, later at [[Kunsan Air Base|Kunsan]]—following the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] in July 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; It had lost forty-one pilots killed during the war.&lt;ref name=Stephens240&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; A further seven pilots became prisoners of war.&lt;ref name=Fighter59&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft losses totalled almost sixty, including over forty Meteors, mostly to ground fire.&lt;ref name=Stephens240/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 230–232&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron flew 18,872 sorties, including 3,872 in Mustangs and 15,000 in Meteors.&lt;ref name=Fighter59/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; It was credited with shooting down five MiG-15s and destroying 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, ninety-eight locomotives and carriages, and sixteen bridges.&lt;ref name=Stephens240/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Flight included Robertson's personal Dakota, operating under his direction.&lt;ref name=Korean314/&gt; The unit's complement of two Dakotas and two Austers was soon augmented by two more Dakotas from Australia.&lt;ref name=Eather163&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1&amp;nbsp;November 1950, No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Flight was renamed [[No. 30 Communications Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit]].&lt;ref name=APDC91WG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Transport150&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, it received another four Dakotas from [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron]], of [[No. 90 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;90 (Composite) Wing]] in [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]], giving it a strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers.&lt;ref name=Transport150/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The unit supported all Australian forces in Korea.&lt;ref name=Eather163/&gt; One of its key functions was medical evacuation, but it was also responsible for supply drops, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and mail delivery, as well as transporting cargo, troops, and VIPs.&lt;ref name=Transport150/&gt; Unlike No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, it was not tasked by Fifth Air Force but instead operated under Australian control, which was exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan.&lt;ref name=Eather163/&gt;  No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit was re-formed as [[No. 30 Transport Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30 Transport Unit]] on 5&amp;nbsp;November 1951, and as [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;36 (Transport) Squadron]] on 10&amp;nbsp;March 1953.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather169&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; During the war it transported around 100,000 passengers and over 6,000 tons of cargo.&lt;ref name=Eather169/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing's records listed 12,762 medical evacuations from Korea to Japan, and over 2,000 from Japan to Australia or Britain.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', pp. 583–584&lt;/ref&gt; The transportation unit lost an Auster and a Wirraway to crashes, resulting in four deaths.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===

When the Korean War broke out, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron was self-supporting. The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea, leading to the formation of No.&amp;nbsp;391 (Base) Squadron at Iwakuni, at the same time as No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing headquarters.&lt;ref name=OBrien58&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative, logistical, medical, communications and security functions.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Staffed mainly by former No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron members, in the first year of its existence No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron had to contend with severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment.&lt;ref name=OBrien58/&gt; Further problems arose following the introduction of the Meteor, as spares for the British-made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Along with its RAAF responsibilities, No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron supported [[Australian Army]] and other UN personnel travelling through Iwakuni.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; It ran No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing's &quot;Transit Hotel&quot;, which accommodated business people and entertainers, as well as military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article78896684 |title=World's most unusual hotel |newspaper=Nambour Chronicle and North Coast Advertiser |date=18 September 1953 |accessdate=22 October 2014 |page=11|via=[[National Library of Australia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron's medical contingent was heavily engaged in the preparation and escort of injured personnel from Korea to Iwakuni and then to other destinations.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;491 Squadron was also formed in tandem with No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing on 20&amp;nbsp;October 1950. Headquartered at Iwakuni, it was responsible for all maintenance of the wing's aircraft except day-to-day servicing. A section was attached to No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron in South Korea to assist ground staff with daily maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maintenance Units'', pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel from Iwakuni were regularly rotated through this section, and augmented by additional No.&amp;nbsp;491 Squadron staff as needed for repair or salvage work. The standard RAAF working days for technicians at Iwakuni contrasted with shifts of up to sixteen hours near the front line in Korea.&lt;ref name=Eather124&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RAAFinJapan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://korean-war.commemoration.gov.au/support-base-in-japan/royal-australian-air-force-in-japan.php#no491-squadron|title=The RAAF in Japan|work=Australia's involvement in the Korean War|publisher=[[Department of Veterans' Affairs (Australia)|Department of Veterans' Affairs]]|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korea was one of the coldest climates in which RAAF ground crews had ever worked; Squadron Leader Cresswell recalled seeing maintenance staff with tools frozen to their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Nos.&amp;nbsp;391 and 491 Squadrons used Japanese technicians as well as Australian, which was unusual for the time; during the [[occupation of Japan]] following its surrender in World War&amp;nbsp;II, the RAAF had only employed Japanese workers for menial tasks.&lt;ref name=Korean314/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather124/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=RAAFinJapan/&gt;--&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron stood down at Kunsan on 7&amp;nbsp;October 1954 and flew its Meteors to Iwakuni five days later. It departed for Australia in November and became operational again at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales, on 4&amp;nbsp;January 1955.&lt;ref name=Korea592&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; Its eleven-year absence from Australia, beginning in the Pacific during World War&amp;nbsp;II and continuing in Japan as part of BCOF, was a record for an RAAF unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=74|title=77 Squadron home after 11 years away|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;491 Squadron disbanded at Iwakuni on 13&amp;nbsp;December 1954.&lt;ref name=Korea592/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron ceased flying on 13&amp;nbsp;March 1955 and returned to Australia, leaving behind three Dakotas and a Wirraway that equipped [[RAAF Transport Flight (Japan)]], formed the following day under No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Transport Flight (Japan), ''Unit History Sheet'', 14 March 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 58, 185&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;391 Squadron and No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing headquarters were disbanded at Iwakuni on 30&amp;nbsp;April 1955.&lt;ref name=Korea592/&gt;  Transport Flight (Japan) flew a courier service to South Korea and remained operational until 8&amp;nbsp;July 1956, when its last Dakota—the last RAAF aircraft in Japan—departed Iwakuni.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;
