The '''Battle of Darayya (November 2012–February 2013)''' was fought from the end of 2012 to the beginning of 2013 between the Syrian Army and the Syrian rebels in the Damascus suburbs of Darayya.

==Background==
Darayya is a suburb of Damascus where rebels have attempted to create a stronghold near Damascus center. In August 2012, the Syrian Army defeated the rebel forces and took control of the town. After the failed rebel offensive in late July 2012, the Syrian army started a campaign against rebels in Damascus suburb that led to a massacre in Darayya with an estimated 500 people were found executed, with rebels and government accusing each other of being responsible for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Janine di Giovanni|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/07/syria-daraya-massacre-ghost-town|title=Syria crisis: Daraya massacre leaves a ghost town still counting its dead |publisher=Guardian |date=7 September 2012|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
The rebels again took control of the town in November 2012. Since, the city has been cut off, its electricity cut and has witnessed a continuous shelling. Most of the residents fled as soon as the battle started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/middle-east/218228-top-syria-rebel-commander-killed-in-battle.html |title=Top Syria rebel commander killed in battle |publisher=The Peninsula Qatar |date=2012-12-16 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels were successful at preventing the Syrian Army from entering the town until mid-December when the Army started to intensify their attacks on the city and the nearby city of Moadmiyah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hDqO03OCEny0lOkiaTdk2MAmj58A?docId=CNG.b2afd029d78665b2a372d7215c7a1646.401 |title=Syria troops press assault southwest of Damascus |publisher=Google News|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=2012-12-15 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December, after 30 days of siege, the newspaper Al Watan, close to the government, reported an army progress into Daraya, where the army penetrated the city and isolated rebels fighters in the city center. Al Watan added that most of the fighters were foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islamicinvitationturkey.com/2012/12/20/syrian-forces-advance-in-daraya-local-newspaper/ |title=Syrian forces advance in Daraya – local newspaper |publisher=Islamicinvitationturkey.com |date=2012-12-20 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 31 December, the Army launched its biggest attack on the city, with columns of armed vehicles trying to progress into the city. The rebels attempts to hit the presidential palace and Alawites neighbourhood with their homemade rockets were one of the reason for the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=297908 |title=Assad's forces push to retake Damascus suburb|publisher=JPost |date=2012-12-31 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January, an opposition activist reported that the Syrian army was meeting a very strong resistance in Daraya, but that the Syrian soldiers managed to advance into the main street. The army was also firing from their artillery positions located in the Mount Qasioum on the orchards around Daraya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.channelone.com/ap/international/Syrian-warplanes-bomb-suburbs-of-the-capital-57785378-fm |title=Syrian warplanes bomb suburbs of the capital|work=Channel One News|date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Syrian Observatory, a rebel group, told that the army was sending more reinforcement to Daraya, while Al Watan newspaper wrote that the Army won the Daraya battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/67059-syria-jets-troops-wage-offensive-on-rebels-near-damascus |title=Syria Jets, Troops Wage Offensive on Rebels near Damascus|publisher=Naharnet|date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January, the Syrian Army arrested Mohamed Zawahiri, the brother of the supreme leader of Al Qaida in Daraya.&lt;ref name=&quot;mirror.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Russian today Arabic correspondent was slightly injured when he fell on his hand while running to avoid being caught in crossfire. His report showed the army in control and patrolling most of the town. Rebels spread into different areas of Darayaa and the army still needed several mopping up operation to declare the area as safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0myNSg9vVfk |title=From 'Syrian Battlefield' : &quot;Injured&quot; Reporter Reports On Syrian Army Operation |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-01-05 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the rebel group Syrian Observatory reported that 10 people died in the fighting, including 6 rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA3K61L80 |title=Report: Syrian journalist dies of wounds |publisher=Breitbart|date=2013-01-05 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January, the Syrian army killed a number of rebels near the Al Qasheia school in Daraya, and named the following rebels Odai al-Ward, Ahed Radwan, Moutez Mansour, Khaled al-khateeb, Omar Madwa, Tareq al-Dabbas, and Muhammed Tabow as being among the dead. Several other rebel groups were killed by the army in the other Damascus suburbs, including 12 who were named by the Army.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sana-syria.com/eng/337/2013/01/06/460576.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that the Syrian Army had taken control of parts of Daraya and was sending more soldiers to push for the full conquest of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/syriahroe?ref=stream |title=Syrian Observatory for Human Rights |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 January, concording sources, from security officials to rebels groups revealed that the Syrian Army had taken much of Daraya, entering most of the neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abcnews.go.com&quot;/&gt;

On 19 January, it was reported that the rebels were still in control of parts of Daraya in spite of fierce clashes and heavy shelling by government forces. Rebels also claimed that a MiG pilot in Daraya had defected and used his fighter jet to bombard three Army positions in the area, killing 15 soldiers of the 4th Syrian Army Brigade. Although this was not independently confirmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;itv.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Syria Live Blog&quot;/&gt;

The rebel commander Abu Ali was killed in the shelling of rebels positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;liberation.fr&quot;/&gt;

On 24 January, the government was shelling Daraya from positions on the Qasioun mountain range west of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/france-sees-no-sign-syrias-assad-toppled-soon-155606330.html |accessdate=January 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127005156/http://news.yahoo.com/france-sees-no-sign-syrias-assad-toppled-soon-155606330.html |archivedate=January 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February, the Syrian Army attempted to push further into Darayya, but rebels were able to repel the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/13/world/la-fg-syria-aleppo-20130214 |title=Syria rebels battle for airports in Aleppo region |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2013-02-13 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{see also|Siege of Darayya and Muadamiyat}}
In early August, state media reportedly showed that al-Assad visited his troops in Darayya, although SOHR was reporting the Syrian army shelling Darayya as recently as late June, and opposition activists report fighting as recently as mid-July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20130801/API/1308010601?tc=ar|title=Article no longer available|work=heraldtribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/syriahroe/posts/384575934984084|title=Reef Dimashq Province-SOHR: Regime... - Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - Facebook|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://syrianewsdesk.com/en/news/violent-clashes-erupt-daraya&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Russia Today reported one of its journalist was wounded the same week in Darayya from rebels within the city firing mortars back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/rt-correspondent-wounded-syria-390/|title=RT correspondent wounded in Damascus suburb while filming in Syria|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2013, Syrian government helicopter gunship targeted Darayya with three barrel bombs.
