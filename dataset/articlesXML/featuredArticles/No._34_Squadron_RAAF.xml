'''No. 34 Squadron''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[Very important person|VIP]] transport [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]. It operates [[Boeing Business Jet|Boeing&amp;nbsp;737 Business Jets]] and [[Bombardier Challenger 600|Bombardier Challenger&amp;nbsp;604s]] from [[Defence Establishment Fairbairn]] in [[Canberra]]. The squadron was formed in February 1942 for standard transport duties during World War&amp;nbsp;II, initially flying [[de Havilland Dragon|de&amp;nbsp;Havilland DH.84&amp;nbsp;Dragons]] in Northern Australia. In 1943 it re-equipped with [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47&amp;nbsp;Dakotas]], which it operated in [[New Guinea]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] prior to disbanding in June 1946.

The unit was re-established in March 1948 as No.&amp;nbsp;34 (Communications) Squadron at [[RAAF Base Mallala|RAAF Station Mallala]], South Australia, where it supported activities at the [[Woomera Test Range|Woomera Rocket Range]] before disbanding in October 1955. It was re-raised as No.&amp;nbsp;34 (VIP) Flight in March 1956 at RAAF Base Canberra (later Fairbairn). No.&amp;nbsp;34 Flight was redesignated No.&amp;nbsp;34 (Special Transport) Squadron in July 1959, and No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron in June 1963. During the 1960s it operated Dakotas, [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair Metropolitans]], [[Vickers Viscount]]s, [[Dassault Falcon 20|Dassault Falcon-Mysteres]], [[Hawker Siddeley HS&amp;nbsp;748]]s, and [[BAC One-Eleven|BAC&amp;nbsp;1-11s]], the last three types continuing in service until the late 1980s. The squadron's fleet consisted solely of [[Dassault Falcon&amp;nbsp;900]]s from 1989 until 2002, when it began operating the 737 and Challenger.

To minimise government outlay, the jets may not be employed when available commercial flights satisfy the timing, location and security requirements of a given task. No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron conducts between 1,200 and 1,800 flights each year. A ''Schedule of Special Purpose Flights'' is tabled twice annually in [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]].&lt;ref name=Special/&gt; VIPOPS usually assigns one of No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron's aircraft to approved tasks, but other [[Australian Defence Force]] aircraft are occasionally used for tasks not suited to the BBJ or Challenger; for instance, Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] travelled to China on board a No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron [[Airbus A330 MRTT|Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport]] in April 2013.{{sfn|Moclair, &quot;34SQN&quot;|p=54}}

==History==

===World War II and aftermath===
[[File:No. 34 Sqn Dakotas 1944 (AWM OG2947).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|No. 34 Squadron Dakotas, New Guinea, c.&amp;nbsp;1944|alt=Five twin-engined cargo planes in flight]]
During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four transport units: Nos.&amp;nbsp;33, 34, [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|35]] and [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|36&amp;nbsp;Squadrons]].&lt;ref name=Gillison481&gt;Gillison, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 481].&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;34 (Transport) Squadron was established on 23&amp;nbsp;February at [[RAAF Base Darwin|RAAF Station Darwin]], Northern Territory, four days after [[Bombing of Darwin|the city was bombed]] for the first time.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}} Coming under the control of [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area Command]], the squadron's initial strength was six personnel and two [[de Havilland Dragon|de&amp;nbsp;Havilland DH.84 Dragons]].{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}}&lt;ref name=Gillison481/&gt; They were immediately tasked with transport duties in northern Australia.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}}{{sfn|Eather, ''Flying Squadrons''|pp=69-70}} As well as carrying freight, this involved collecting the first Japanese [[prisoner of war]] to be captured in Australia, a navy fighter pilot who had crashlanded during the raid on Darwin.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=462|title=New 34 Squadron collected Japanese prisoner|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the squadron's two officers, [[Flight Lieutenant]] J.W. Warwick, became the first (acting) commanding officer on 2&amp;nbsp;March. The following day, one of the Dragons was destroyed on the ground at [[Wyndham, Western Australia|Wyndham]], Western Australia, by enemy air attack. With its other aircraft unserviceable, and accommodation at Darwin's civil airfield inadequate, squadron headquarters relocated to [[Daly Waters Airfield]] on 5&amp;nbsp;March. On 14&amp;nbsp;March another Dragon was allocated; this was joined by two [[Avro Anson]]s and two [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]]s in mid-May, by which time the squadron had moved to [[Batchelor Airfield]]. By the end of the month, the squadron had thirty-four personnel, including six officers. It lost one of the Tiger Moths to a bushfire on 1&amp;nbsp;July, a few days after the plane crashlanded south of [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]]. The squadron relocated again on 15&amp;nbsp;July, this time to [[Hughes Airfield]]. It remained at Hughes until 27&amp;nbsp;August, when it transferred to [[Manbulloo Airfield]]; it operated from Manbulloo until it was temporarily disbanded on 13&amp;nbsp;December and its aircraft transferred to No.&amp;nbsp;6 Communications Flight.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}}

No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron was re-formed on 3&amp;nbsp;January 1943 at [[Parafield Airport]], South Australia, from elements of No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron formerly based at [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], Victoria.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}}{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|p=56}} Initially comprising ninety-six personnel and eight aircraft, by the end of the month the squadron's strength had been reduced to seventy personnel and three Dragons operating in South Australia and the Northern Territory. On 11&amp;nbsp;March one of the Dragons was destroyed on takeoff at Parafield, causing two deaths—No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron's first fatalities. Another Dragon was lost in a fire after it crashlanded near [[Tennant Creek]] in April.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}} Beginning in May 1943, the Dragons were augmented by [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]], giving the squadron a total strength of three Dakotas and two Dragons by the following month.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}}{{sfn|Eather, ''Flying Squadrons''|pp=69-70}} By July, No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron was operating five Dakotas, which had fully replaced the Dragons, and in August its strength stood at seven Dakotas and 153 personnel, including forty-seven officers.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}} It subsequently received an [[Airspeed Oxford]] and a [[Douglas DC-2]], and began making supply drops and medical evacuations as far north as [[Port Moresby]], New Guinea.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}}{{sfn|Eather, ''Flying Squadrons''|pp=69-70}} The squadron had its busiest month in May 1944, transporting almost 1,900 passengers and over {{convert|1000000|lbs|kg}} of cargo. On 1&amp;nbsp;June it became the first operational RAAF squadron to have personnel of the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]] (WAAAF) in its ranks, a contingent made up of an officer and twenty airwomen.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}} The WAAAF had been formed in 1941 and eventually made up thirty-one per cent of RAAF ground staff; its members were primarily employed in technical trades and were not permitted to serve in combat theatres.{{sfn|Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force''|p=156}}&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 492].&lt;/ref&gt;

October 1944 saw a detachment of the squadron operating from [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in [[Far North Queensland]] to bases in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Additional detachments were located at [[Townsville]], Queensland, and [[Coomalie Shire|Coomalie Creek]], Northern Territory.{{sfn|Eather, ''Flying Squadrons''|pp=69-70}} In February 1945, No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron commenced a relocation to [[Morotai]] in the Dutch East Indies, under the control of the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]], and was fully established at its new base by mid-April.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}}&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070400--1-.PDF ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 481].&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron supported the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|invasion of Borneo]], and its Dakotas were the first Allied aircraft to land at [[Labuan]] and [[Tarakan]] after the islands were captured. It remained at Morotai until the end of the war, at which time it became involved in repatriating Australian former prisoners of war from Singapore, and then in courier flights supporting the formation of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}}{{sfn|Eather, ''Flying Squadrons''|pp=69-70}} No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron returned to Australia between January and March 1946 and disbanded at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, on 6&amp;nbsp;June.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|pp=41-45}}

The squadron was re-established at [[RAAF Base Mallala|RAAF Station Mallala]], South Australia, on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1948, when No.&amp;nbsp;2 (Communications) Squadron was renamed No.&amp;nbsp;34 (Communications) Squadron.&lt;ref name=Units45&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; It operated as a VIP transport, courier and reconnaissance unit, primarily in support of the [[Woomera Test Range|Woomera rocket range]], focal point of the Anglo-Australian Long Range Weapons Project during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name=RAAFM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/34sqn.htm |title=No. 34 Squadron|publisher=[[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate= 4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Stephens, ''Going Solo''|pp=446-447}} No.&amp;nbsp;34 (Communications) Squadron flew the only [[Vickers_VC.1_Viking|Vickers Viking]] to be taken on strength by the RAAF, and was also the only RAAF squadron to operate the [[Bristol Freighter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A82.htm | title=Vickers Viking|publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate= 4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RAAFBF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A81.htm |title=Bristol Freighter |publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate= 4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Freighters were taken on strength in April and May 1949, and a fourth in September 1951; one was lost with all three crew members in a crash near Mallala on 25&amp;nbsp;November 1953 after its wing failed in flight.&lt;ref name=RAAFBF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19531125-1|title=Accident description|publisher= [[Aviation Safety Network]]|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron also operated [[Percival Prince]], [[Auster]], Dakota and Anson aircraft, undertaking regular transport duties and disaster relief along with its Woomera support work before disbanding at Mallala on 28&amp;nbsp;October 1955.{{sfn|Eather, ''Flying Squadrons''|pp=69-70}}

===VIP operations===
[[File:RAAF Vickers Viscount (AWM 128878).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|No. 34 Squadron Viscount, Fairbairn, c. 1964–69|alt=Four-engined turboprop passenger plane parked on airstrip]]
No.&amp;nbsp;34 (VIP) Flight was established at RAAF Base Canberra on 12&amp;nbsp;March 1956, and charged with the safe carriage of the Governor-General, senior Australian politicians and military officers, and visiting foreign dignitaries. It was formed from the VIP Flight of No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron, under [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;86 (Transport) Wing]].&lt;ref name=Units45/&gt;{{sfn|Stephens, ''Going Solo''|pp=416, 426}} The VIP Flight had absorbed the RAAF's [[Governor-General's Flight RAAF|Governor-General's Flight]] in October 1950.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|p=184}} In its first year of operation, No.&amp;nbsp;34 Flight carried the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] on his tour of Australia.&lt;ref name=Units45/&gt; It was equipped with two [[Convair CV-240|Convair 440 Metropolitans]], as well as Dakotas.{{sfn|Eather, ''Flying Squadrons''|pp=69-70}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A96.htm |title=Convair Metropolitan |publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate= 4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight remained in Canberra when No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing relocated to Richmond in 1958. On 1&amp;nbsp;July 1959, it was re-formed as No.&amp;nbsp;34 (Special Transport) Squadron, leaving the control of No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing to become an independent unit directly administered by [[RAAF Air Command|Home Command]] and tasked by RAAF Base Canberra.&lt;ref name=Units45/&gt;{{sfn|Stephens, ''Going Solo''|pp=416, 426}}  &quot;Possibly because of the rank of its clients&quot;, contended the official history of the post-war Air Force, the squadron maintained higher standards than other transport units, adopting some procedures from the civil aviation world. It also benefitted from the personal interest of senior officials when it came to upgrading its equipment, though this had some negative aspects. The acquisition of the Metropolitans, the first pressurised aircraft in the VIP fleet, was organised by Minister for Air [[Athol Townley]] without any advance discussion with the RAAF. Although the Air Force raised performance and safety concerns, the type's entry into service was a ''fait accompli'', and it remained on strength for twelve years.{{sfn|Stephens, ''Going Solo''|pp=426-427}} Until the early 1960s, the VIP unit also operated two [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Vampire]] jets and two [[CAC Winjeel]] trainers to allow staff officers at Canberra's [[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]] to maintain their flying proficiency.{{sfn|Stephens, ''Going Solo''|p=437}}

No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron's home in Canberra was renamed RAAF Base Fairbairn in March 1962, and the unit was redesignated No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron on 13&amp;nbsp;June 1963.&lt;ref name=Units45/&gt;{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units''|p=139}} That year, the squadron carried [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] for the first time.&lt;ref name=34SQNHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/Air-Command/Air-Mobility-Group/No.-84-Wing/No.-34-Squadron/?RAAF-5osdukf6+PE5/jEXa17cEq3aEiQLl43C |title=No. 34 Squadron's history|publisher =Royal Australian Air Force|accessdate= 28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1964, two second-hand [[Vickers Viscount]] turboprop transports were obtained to supplement the Dakotas and Convairs; the two [[piston-engine]] types were withdrawn after the delivery of two [[Hawker Siddeley HS&amp;nbsp;748]]s beginning in April 1967 and three [[Dassault Falcon 20]] jets (known as Mystere in RAAF service) in June. Two [[BAC One-Eleven|BAC 1-11]] jets joined the squadron on 19&amp;nbsp;January 1968, and the two Viscounts were retired in March the following year.{{sfn|Eather, ''Flying Squadrons''|pp=69-70}}&lt;ref name=RV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series3/A6.htm |title=Vickers Viscount|publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate= 4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wholesale re-equipment of the VIP fleet in the late 1960s was controversial, and questions were raised in Parliament regarding its cost and operations. The so-called &quot;VIP affair&quot; led to more stringent guidelines governing No. 34 Squadron's tasking, requiring approval for flights to be made by the British Royal Family, the Governor-General, the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], or the Minister for Air. Eligibility criteria were also codified, and potential passengers included Federal ministers, opposition leaders, &quot;individuals of similar status and importance visiting Australia&quot;, two-star officers and above, and other dignitaries of similar status.{{sfn|Stephens, ''Going Solo''|pp=427-428}} During the 1970s one of No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron's BAC 1-11s experienced an engine failure over the Tasman Sea while carrying Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] to New Zealand. The aircraft made a safe landing in Australia, but the incident led the RAAF to investigate using three- or four-engined aircraft for future VIP flights involving long over-water legs.{{sfn|Wilson, ''Military Aircraft of Australia''|p=29}} The government eventually purchased two [[Boeing 707]]s from [[Qantas]] to perform long-range VIP flights and to improve the RAAF's strategic transport capabilities. Entering service in 1979, they joined the newly established No.&amp;nbsp;33 Flight (later No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron) in 1981.{{sfn|Wilson, ''Military Aircraft of Australia''|p=37}} More 707s were acquired between 1983 and 1988, and four were converted for [[aerial refueling|air-to-air refuelling]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=RAAF_Museum_707&gt;{{cite web|title= Boeing 707|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series3/A20.htm|publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falcon&amp;nbsp;900s were replaced by two Boeing 737 Business Jets and three Bombardier Challenger 604s in July 2002.

This decision led to controversy in 2007, after the [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 200|crash of a Garuda airliner]] killed four Australian government officials and a journalist travelling in connection with a visit to Indonesia by Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]], who had flown on a Challenger.{{sfn|McPhedran, ''Air Force''|pp=279-280}}  No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron and Qantas Defence Services marked 20,000 incident-free flying hours with the 737s and Challengers on 21&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&amp;iid=19393&amp;startpage=7&amp;crd=0&amp;searchKey=34+squadron|last=Rollings|first=Barry|title=34SQN's top 20|magazine=[[Air Force (newspaper)|Air Force]]|date=27 November 2008|page=7|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year saw further controversy when Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] had to apologise for remarks to a cabin attendant over the meal he was served on one of the jets.{{sfn|McPhedran, ''Air Force''|p=283}} In 2011, the squadron provided VIP transport during tours of Australia by Queen Elizabeth, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], and [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Frederik]] and [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Mary of Denmark]], as well as support for US President [[Barack Obama]]'s visit to Canberra.&lt;ref name=34SQNHistory/&gt; It also flew senior government and military personnel in support of relief efforts during the [[2010–11 Queensland floods|Queensland floods]], and was again awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency.&lt;ref name=34SQN/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron celebrated its 70th anniversary at [[Parliament House, Canberra]], on 18&amp;nbsp;February 2012; the following day, a memorial to its first fatalities in March 1942 was unveiled at Fairbairn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/entertainment/vip-fleet-formed-as-darwin-burned-20120221-1tlbn.html|last=Mills|first=Lyn|title=VIP fleet formed as Darwin burned|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=22 February 2012| accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&amp;iid=59910&amp;startpage=8|last=Solomou|first=Bill|title=Memorial a moving tribute|magazine=Air Force|date=1 March 2012|page=9|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lease on its aircraft is due to expire in 2014, and they may be replaced with new types.{{sfn|Moclair, &quot;34SQN&quot;|p=55}}
