The '''Kh-31''' ({{lang-ru|[[Kha (Cyrillic)|Х]]-31}}; '''AS-17 'Krypton'''')&lt;ref name=&quot;DT&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Missiles in the Asia Pacific|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/DT-Missile-Survey-May-05.pdf | journal=Defence Today | publisher=Strike Publications |location=Amberley, Queensland   | date=May 2005 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a [[Russia]]n air-to-surface missile carried by aircraft such as the [[MiG-29]] or [[Su-27]]. It is capable of [[Mach number|Mach]] 3.5 and was the first supersonic anti-ship missile that could be launched by tactical aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot;&gt;{{citation | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4S3h8j_NEmkC&amp;pg=PA534 | title=The Naval Institute Guide to World Naval Weapon Systems | first= Norman | last=Friedman | pages=534–5 | edition=5th | publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=2006 | isbn=978-1-55750-262-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several variants, it is best known as an [[anti-radiation missile]] (ARM) but there are also anti-shipping and target drone versions. There has been talk of adapting it to make an &quot;AWACS killer&quot;, a long-range air-to-air missile.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT&quot; /&gt;

==Development==
The proliferation of [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) has made the [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defence]] a priority for any modern air force intending offensive action. Knocking out air search radars and [[fire control radar]]s is an essential part of this mission. ARMs must have [[standoff (missile)|sufficient range]] that the launch platform is out of range of the SAMs, high speed to reduce the risk of being shot down and a seeker that can detect a range of radar types, but they do not need a particularly big warhead.

The Soviet Union's first ARM was developed by the Raduga OKB engineering group responsible for the Soviet Union's missiles for heavy bombers. The Kh-22P was developed from the 6-tonne [[Raduga Kh-22]] (AS-4 'Kitchen') missile. Experience gained with this led in 1973 to the [[Kh-28]] (AS-9 'Kyle') carried by tactical aircraft such as the [[Su-7]]B, [[Su-17]] and [[Su-24]]. It had Mach 3 capability and a {{convert|120|km|nmi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} range, greater than the contemporary [[AGM-78 Standard ARM]]. The Kh-28 was succeeded by the [[Kh-58]] in 1978, which has similar speed and range but replaces the dual-fuel rocket motor with a much safer RDTT solid propellant.

The development of more sophisticated SAMs such as the [[MIM-104 Patriot]] and the US Navy's [[Aegis combat system]] put pressure on the Soviets to develop better ARMs in turn.&lt;ref name=&quot;china-crc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2000_2003/pdfs/strat.pdf |title=China's Military Strategy Toward the U.S. |publisher=www.uscc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;china-p&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/pdf/npp/CRSchinamissilesupdated081000.pdf |title=CRS Report for Congress, China: Ballistic and Cruise Missiles| publisher=www.carnegieendowment.org |date=2000-08-10|accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zvezda came at the problem from a different angle to Raduga, having a background in lightweight air-to-air missiles. However, in the mid-1970s they had developed the successful [[Kh-25]] family of short-range air-to-surface missiles, including the Kh-25MP ([[AS-12 Kegler|AS-12 'Kegler']]) for [[anti-radar]] use. Zvezda started work on a long-range ARM and the first launch of the Kh-31 was in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot; /&gt; It entered service in 1988{{Citation needed | date=January 2009}} and was first displayed in public in 1991, the Kh-31P at Dubai and the Kh-31A at Minsk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot; /&gt;

In December 1997 it was reported that a small number of Kh-31's had been delivered to China, but that &quot;production had yet to begin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=China and Russia combine on KR-1 | first=Douglas | last=Barrie | url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%203365.html |magazine=Flight International | date=1997-12-10 | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this time that the Russians sold [[Su-30MKK]] 'Flanker-G' aircraft to the Chinese. It seems that the original deliveries were of the original Russian model designated as X-31, to allow testing whilst the KR-1 model was being developed for licence production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janes&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Defence-Weekly-98/RUSSIA--AS-17-KRYPTON-KH-31.html | title=Russia: - AS-17 Krypton (Kh-31) | journal=Jane's Defence Weekly | date=1998-09-09 | accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local production may have started by July 2005.

Russian development has accelerated since Zvezda was subsumed into the Tactical Missiles Corporation in 2002, with the announcement of the 'D' extended range models and the 'M' model mid-life updates (see Variants section below).

==Design==
[[File:Seeker of Kh-31 missile.jpg|thumb|L112E seeker]]
In many respects the Kh-31 is a miniaturised version of the  P-270 [[P-270 Moskit|Moskit]] (SS-N-22 'Sunburn') and was reportedly designed by the same man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot; /&gt; The missile is conventionally shaped, with cruciform wings and control surfaces made from titanium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braucksick&quot; /&gt;  The two-stage propulsion is notable. On launch, a solid-fuel booster in the tail accelerates the missile to Mach 1.8&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot; /&gt; and the motor is discarded. Then four air intakes open up and as in the Franco-German ANS/ANF the empty rocket case becomes the combustion chamber of a kerosene-fuelled [[ramjet]], which takes it beyond Mach 4.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT&quot; /&gt;

The L-111E seeker of the anti-radar version has a unique antenna, an [[interferometer]] array of seven spiral antennas on a steerable platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT&quot; /&gt; The seekers delivered to China in 2001-2 were {{convert|106.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|36|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and weighed {{convert|23|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janes20050711&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=China may be producing Kh-31P ARM |url=http://www.janes.com/extract/jmr2005/jmr01502.html |journal=Jane's Missiles and Rockets |date=2005-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202043721/http://www.janes.com/extract/jmr2005/jmr01502.html |archivedate=February 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
The Kh-31P ARM entered service in Russia in 1988 and the Kh-31A anti-shipping version in 1989. Unlike its predecessors, it can be fitted to almost any of Russia's tactical aircraft, from the [[Su-17]] to [[MiG-31]].

A few Kh-31P/KR-1's were delivered to China in 1997 but these were apparently for testing and development work. The Chinese ordered Russian missiles in late 2002 or early 2003, leading to 200 KR-1's in their inventory by 2005;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot; /&gt; the Chinese press reported in July 2005 that Su-30MKK's of the 3rd Air Division had been equipped with the missiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janes20050711&quot; /&gt; In 2001 India bought Kh-31s for its [[Su-30MKI]]; they appear to have bought 60 Kh-31A and 90 Kh-31P.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot; /&gt;

The [[US Navy]] bought [[MA-31]] target drones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braucksick&quot; /&gt; An $18.468-million order for thirty-four MA-31 was placed in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=1670|title=Contracts for Thursday, December 16, 1999 | publisher=US Department of Defense | date=1999-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this order was blocked by the Russians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley&quot;&gt;Buckley 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The MA-31 was launched from an [[F-4 Phantom]], and work was done on a kit to launch it from an F-16.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braucksick&quot;&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2004rangeops/17Nov04/Braucksick.ppt | title=MA-31 Target Vehicle OVERVIEW | first=Ken |last=Braucksick | date=2004-11-17 | publisher=NDIA}}. Sales pitch from Boeing, has useful diagrams of flight profiles etc&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some reports, the missile was used by the Russian Air Force during the South Ossetian conflict in 2008. In particular, reported that in the August 10, 2008 a Russian Air Force Su-34 struck with [[anti-radar missile]]s Kh-31P an [[air defense radar]] of Georgia near the city of Gori, then Georgian air defense was disabled in order to avoid further losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/2009/12/21/912023|title=-       -34|work=Vedomosti.ru|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with the additional equipment, the MA-31 was capable of Mach 2.7 and 15G manoevres in its anti-ship (sea-skimming) flight profile and Mach 3.5 in ARM mode at {{convert|48000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braucksick&quot; /&gt;
* '''KR-1''' - version of the Kh-31P exported to China in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight&quot; /&gt; It seems that Zvezda wanted to sell an initial batch of KR-1's to China, before the KR-1 went into production in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight&quot; /&gt; Rather than the original three seeker modules, the KR-1 has a single K-112E &quot;export&quot; seeker targeting [[D band (NATO)|D]]-[[F band (NATO)|F band]] ([[S band]]) emissions, and reportedly optimised for specific Taiwanese radars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot; /&gt;
* '''[[YJ-91]]''' ''Ying Ji 91'' - Chinese missile based on the Kh-31P, with faster speed, slightly longer range, and easier switching of seeker heads.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} They are also reported to have developed an anti-shipping version with an indigenous active seeker, and are looking to develop this for use in submarines. The name YJ-91 was already in use by 1997, and may have been a Chinese name for the original Russian missiles&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight&quot; /&gt; designated X-31 by the Russians. By 2005, the name '''YJ-93''' was being applied to missiles made in China,&lt;ref name=&quot;Janes20050711&quot; /&gt; but Western reports generally do not distinguish between YJ-91 and YJ-93.

An active/passive air-to-air version for use against slow-moving support aircraft, a so-called &quot;AWACS killer&quot;, was announced at the 1992 [[MAKS Airshow|Moscow air show]] with {{convert|200|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}} range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot; /&gt; That would be less than the {{convert|300|-|400|km|nmi mi}} promised by the [[Vympel R-37]] (AA-13 'Arrow') and Novator [[R-172]] missiles, but a Kh-31 derivative could be carried by a wider range of aircraft. However this may have been mere propaganda; in 2004 the Tactical Missiles Corporation &quot;emphatically denied&quot; that it had ever worked on an air-to-air version of the Kh-31.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janes2&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Air-Launched-Weapons/Kh-31-AS-17-Russian-Federation.html | title=Kh-31 (AS-17) (Russian Federation), Air-to-air Missiles - Beyond Visual Range | journal=Jane's Air-Launched Weapons| date=2004-11-18| accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 rumours persisted of a Russian AWACS killer based on the Kh-31A anti-shipping model, and of the Chinese adapting the YJ-91, derived from the Kh-31P, for the same purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT&quot; /&gt;
