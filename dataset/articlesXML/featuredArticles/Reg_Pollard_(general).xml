[[Lieutenant general (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] '''Sir Reginald George Pollard''', {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|KCVO|KBE|CB|DSO}} (20 January 1903&amp;nbsp;– 9 March 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Australian Army]], serving as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] from 1960 to 1963. Born in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], New South Wales, Pollard graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1924. A regular officer, he served as [[adjutant]]/[[quartermaster]] in several [[battalion]]s of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Military Forces]] (CMF) during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1938 he was posted to England to undertake staff training, which was cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War. Pollard joined the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] in 1940, and the following year saw action with the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] in the Middle East, where he was [[mentioned in despatches]]. Promoted to [[colonel]] in 1942, he became senior staff officer of the 7th Division in [[New Guinea]], and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his actions. He spent much of the remainder of the war in staff and training positions in Australia.

Pollard's early post-war roles involved recruit training, land/air warfare, administration, and planning. In 1953, he was promoted to [[brigadier]] and took command of the Australian Army Component of the [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea]]. He joined the Military Board as a [[major general]] in 1954, and was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the following year. In 1957 he was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] and took charge of [[2nd Military District (Australia)|Eastern Command]] in [[Sydney]]; two years later he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]]. [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Knighted]] in 1961, as Chief of the General Staff he presided over the Army's reorganisation as a [[Pentropic organisation|pentropic]] structure, and worked towards making Duntroon a degree-granting institution. In 1962, he oversaw deployment of the first [[Australian Army Training Team Vietnam|team of Australian military advisors]] to [[South Vietnam]]. After retiring from the military in 1963, Pollard became [[Honorary Colonel]] of the [[Royal Australian Regiment]]; he served as Australian Secretary to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] during the Royal Visit in 1970 and was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] the same year. He died at [[Wyrallah, New South Wales|Wyrallah]], New South Wales, in 1978.

==Early life==
Reginald George Pollard was born on 20 January 1903 in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], New South Wales, the third son of Albert Edgar Pollard, an English accountant, and his Australian wife Thalia Rebecca, née McLean.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Chris|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160020b.htm|title=Pollard, Sir Reginald George (1903–1978)|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schooled in Bathurst, Reg entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1921, and graduated with the [[Sword of Honour (Duntroon)|Sword of Honour]] for &quot;exemplary conduct and performance&quot; in 1924.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31658745 |title=Royal Military College, Duntroon |newspaper=[[The Queanbeyan Age]] |date=12 December 1924 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollard and fellow graduate [[Frederick Scherger]], winner of the [[King's Medal (Duntroon)|King's Medal]] and future [[air chief marshal]], applied to transfer to the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) under a scheme designed to augment the RAAF's officer corps, but only Scherger was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Duntroon'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The previous year, Pollard and Scherger had inaugurated a Duntroon tradition when they found a horse's jawbone during a field exercise. Inspired by the Biblical tale in which [[Samson]] slays the [[Philistines]] with the jawbone of an ass, they declared their find a lucky charm and brought it back to the college as a mascot; it became known as &quot;Enobesra&quot; (reportedly because &quot;jawbone seemed so commonplace, an [[buttocks|arsebone]] sounded much more interesting and spelt backwards sounded both mysterious and respectable&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Duntroon'', pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranked [[lieutenant]] in the Permanent Military Force (PMF), Pollard was appointed [[adjutant]]/[[quartermaster]] of the [[17th Battalion (Australia)|17th Battalion]] [[Australian Army Reserve|(Citizens Military Forces)]], headquartered at [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]], in July 1925.&lt;ref name=List&gt;''The Army List'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article142318440 |title=Biography: Lieut-Gen.

===Chief of the General Staff===
On 1 July 1960, Pollard succeeded Lieutenant General [[Ragnar Garrett|Sir Ragnar Garrett]] as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS), and was raised to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated on 2&amp;nbsp;June 1961.&lt;ref name=Horner194&gt;Horner ''Strategic Command'', pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=42371 |date=2 June 1961 |startpage=4180 |supp=yes |accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although favoured by Garrett, Pollard's succession had not been a foregone conclusion. The [[Department of the Army (Australia)|Minister for the Army]], [[John Cramer (Australian politician)|John Cramer]], attempted to appoint Major General [[Ivan Dougherty]], a retired CMF officer, but the proposal was defeated in [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] on the advice of the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]], [[Athol Townley]], who feared the antagonism it was likely to engender among the senior ranks of the Regular Army.&lt;ref name=Horner194/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grey, ''The Australian Army'', pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;

As CGS, Pollard oversaw a major restructure of the Army.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Following the lead of the US military, in 1960 the Australian Army replaced its &quot;triangular&quot; divisional structure of three infantry battalions under brigade headquarters, with a &quot;[[Pentropic organisation|pentropic]]&quot; organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters.&lt;ref name=Grey204&gt;Grey, ''The Australian Army'', pp. 204–207&lt;/ref&gt; The reorganisation had been sponsored by Garrett and agreed to by Townley in December 1959.&lt;ref name=Horner194/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Chris Clark, Pollard was &quot;personally ambivalent&quot; about the change, which was intended to rationalise resources and strengthen the battalions for overseas deployments but also resulted in the disbandment of the citizens' brigades and many other militia units.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grey204/&gt; The US in any case abandoned the pentropic system in June 1961, and the Australian Army ultimately returned to the triangular formation following a review commissioned by Pollard's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General Wilton, in October 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Grey, ''The Australian Army'', pp. 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', pp. 419–420&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Pollard's focus areas as CGS was the academic qualifications of Army officers. Concerned that Duntroon graduates would begin to fall behind their tertiary-educated peers in the community, he worked to make the college a degree-granting institution, though this did not come to fruition until 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Duntroon'', pp. 269–275&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1961, Pollard told the Secretary of the Defence Committee that he considered the Army's strength inadequate to support the government's policy of &quot;forward defence&quot;, which involved meeting Communist aggression in South East Asia, well away from the Australian mainland. The CMF, he contended, was not properly equipped to provide relief for regular forces deployed overseas, and conscription &quot;would appear to be politically and economically out of the question&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 198, 396&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the government [[National Service Act 1964|reintroduced conscription in 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; As the threat of [[South Vietnam]] falling to a Communist takeover became more apparent, the Army began in 1962 to exercise specifically to combat [[counter-insurgency]] operations, a type of warfare Pollard characterised as &quot;frustrating groping at an elusive enemy&quot;; he added that &quot;no purely military solution to a Communist insurgency situation is possible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In May that year, the Federal government agreed to South Vietnam's request for military instructors; Pollard was responsible for laying down guidelines for the thirty advisors deployed in August as part of the [[Australian Army Training Team Vietnam]], led by his friend Colonel [[Ted Serong]].&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of sixty, Pollard left the military on 20 January 1963, having  recommended Wilton as his successor.&lt;ref name=Horner194/&gt; He became a [[Pastoral farming|grazier]] on a farm at [[Wesburn, Victoria|Wesburn]], Victoria. In July 1965, he was made [[Honorary Colonel]] (later [[Colonel Commandant]]) of the [[Royal Australian Regiment]], in which capacity he visited Australian troops in South Vietnam.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; He served as Australian Secretary to [[Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] for the Royal Visit in 1970, and was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] in recognition of his services; the honour was promulgated on 29 May 1970, backdated to 3 May.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=45110 |date=29 May 1970 |startpage=6039|endpage=6040 |accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he moved to a new property, which he christened ''Duntroon'', at [[Wyrallah, New South Wales|Wyrallah]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Pollard died suddenly at his Wyrallah home on 9 March 1978. He was survived by his wife and two sons, and cremated.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110887104 |title=In brief: General dies |newspaper=The Canberra Times |date=11 March 1978 |accessdate=14 May 2015 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
