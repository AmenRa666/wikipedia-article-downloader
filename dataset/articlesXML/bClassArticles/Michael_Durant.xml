==Life and career==
Durant is a native of [[Berlin, New Hampshire]], the son of Leon and Louise Durant. He entered the U.S. Army in August 1979. Following [[basic training]], he attended the [[Defense Language Institute]], and was then assigned to the 470th Military Intelligence Group at [[Fort Clayton]] in [[Panama]] as a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] voice intercept operator. He then completed [[helicopter]] flight training at [[Fort Rucker]], [[Alabama]]. During [[flight school]], he flew the [[Schweizer 300|TH-55]] trainer and [[UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] [[helicopter]]s.

Upon appointment to Warrant Officer 1 in November 1983, he completed the UH-60 Blackhawk Aviators Qualification Course and was assigned to the 377th Medical Evacuation Company in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. By the time he was 24, he had flown over 150 medevac missions in the UH-1 and [[UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60]]. After 18 months, he transitioned to the 101st Aviation Battalion at [[Fort Campbell]], [[Kentucky]]. As a Chief Warrant Officer 2, he attended the [[flight instructor|instructor]] pilot course and flew air assault missions in the UH-60. Durant joined the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) on August 1, 1988. Assigned to D Company, he performed duties as Flight Lead and Standardization Instructor Pilot. He participated in combat operations [[Operation Prime Chance|Prime Chance]]; [[Operation Just Cause|Just Cause]]; and [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]], where he was the first U.S. helicopter pilot to engage with a [[SCUD]] [[missile]] launcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/goe/eagle_bios/2005/durant_2005.html ACSC GOE: Michael J. Durant 2005 Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Operation Gothic Serpent]] in Somalia, Durant was the pilot of helicopter &quot;Super Six Four.&quot; It was the second [[UH-60 Black Hawk|MH-60L]] of two Black Hawk helicopters to crash during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] on October 3, 1993. His helicopter was hit on the tail by a [[rocket-propelled grenade]]. That led to its crash about a mile southwest of the operation's target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The battle of Mogadishu: first-hand accounts from the men of Task Force Ranger|first=Matt|last= Eversmann|page=36|publisher =Presidio Press|year= 2005 |ISBN=978-0-345-45966-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durant and his crew of three, Bill Cleveland, Ray Frank, and Tommy Field, survived the crash, though they were all badly injured. Durant suffered a broken femur and a badly injured back.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/27/lklw.00.html &quot;Encore Presentation: 1993 Interview With Michael Durant,&quot; CNN: Larry King Weekend (January 27, 2002).]&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Delta Force]] snipers, [[Gary Gordon|MSG Gary Gordon]] and [[Randy Shughart|SFC Randy Shughart]], had been providing suppressive fire from the air at hostile Somalis who were converging on the crash site. Both volunteered for insertion onto the ground to protect the crew and join Durant in fighting off the advancing Somalis. The pair killed an estimated 25 Somalis, before they ran out of ammunition. They were soon overwhelmed and killed, after Cleveland, Frank and Field had died. Both Gordon and Shughart received the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously for their heroism in this action.&lt;ref name=willbanks&gt;{{cite book|title=America's Heroes: Medal of Honor Recipients from the Civil War to Afghanistan |first=James H.|last=Willbanks |page=308|publisher= ABC-CLIO|year=2011 |ISBN= 978-1-59884-393-4  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hostile Somalis captured sole American survivor Durant and held him captive for eleven days. During much of his imprisonment, he was personally protected and cared for by a physician and Somali General [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]]'s propaganda minister, Abdullahi &quot;Firimbi&quot; Hassan, though he was shot in his arm by an intruding militia member. General Aidid then released Durant and a [[Nigerian]] soldier who had been captured previously, into the custody of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;

After being freed, and recovering at Landstuhl Air Base in Germany, Durant resumed flying with the 160th SOAR. He retired from the Army in 2001 with more than 3,700 flight hours, over 1,400 of which were flown under [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]]. He now offers seminars to military personnel about helicopter maneuvering and [[Combat Search and Rescue]] (CSAR) operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A History of Army Aviation: From Its Beginnings to the War on Terror|first=James|last= Williams|page=373|publisher =iUniverse|year= 2005 |ISBN=978-0-595-36608-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durant offers talks about the Somalia raid and the experiences he had while in captivity. He spoke extensively with actor [[Ron Eldard]], who portrayed him in the movie ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'', which chronicles the events of the raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Combat Films: American Realism, 1945 - 2010|edition=2|first=Steven Jay|last= Rubin |page=259|publisher =McFarland|year= 2011 |ISBN=978-0-7864-5892-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Durant published a book, ''[[In the Company of Heroes]]'', in which he chronicled his military career and his captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Durant, Michael  |author2=Hartov, Steven |lastauthoramp=yes |title=In the Company of Heroes|edition= |publisher=Putnam Pub Group|location=|year=2003|pages=|isbn=0-399-15060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durant was a member of the Bush-Cheney '04 Veterans Team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=George Washington University|url=
http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2004/bush/bushorgvet.html|accessdate=4 October 2011|title=BUSH-CHENEY '04 NATIONAL VETERANS STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the McCain '08 Veterans team. In this political capacity for McCain, he criticized the presumptive Presidential Democratic candidate, Senator [[Barack Obama]]. for having cancelled a planned trip to [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]] (LRMC) near [[Ramstein Air Base]] in [[Germany]] where he had intended, while in Europe. to visit American casualties of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Durant said he thought this was inappropriate for a potential Commander in Chief especially since Durant himself had recovered from his wounds at LRMC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foxnews.com/video?playerId=videolandingpage&amp;maven_playlistId=0bc56e415b2e04a215f6a3dba55a3402fc523c09&amp;maven_referrer=rss&amp;referralPlaylistId=0bc56e415b2e04a215f6a3dba55a3402fc523c09&amp;referralObject=2755153 &quot;Vet vs. Obama,&quot; FoxNews.com (July 29, 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt; Obama felt that he did not want to exploit the visit for the benefit of his campaign, prior to the election, but he did telephone those recovering military patients there and also paid a visit to a military hospital in Baghdad and to troops in Afghanistan. Retired two-star Air Force general Scott Gration, who advised the campaign and traveled with Obama on the trip said: “Senator Obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/obama-skips-visit-with-troops The cancellation of Obama's troop visit], ''[[New York Times]], Jeff Zeleny, July 25, 2008. Retrieved 5 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Durant holds a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree in professional aeronautics and a [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree in aviation management from the [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]]. He is owner, president and CEO of Pinnacle Solutions, an engineering services company based in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leadingauthorities.com/21407/Michael_Durant.htm Michael Durant - Leading Authorities Speakers Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt; Pinnacle Solutions specializes in aviation training and the development of sophisticated training devices such as high-fidelity aircraft simulators. He and his wife, Lisa, have six children.
