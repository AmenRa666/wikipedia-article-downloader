'''John Sidney &quot;Jack&quot; McCain Jr.''' (January 17, 1911 – March 22, 1981) was a [[United States Navy]] [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]], who served in conflicts from the 1940s through the 1970s, including as the Commander, [[United States Pacific Command]].

McCain grew up in [[Washington, D.C.]], and graduated from the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1931, after which he entered the [[submarine]] service.  In [[World War II]], he commanded submarines in several theaters of operation, was responsible for sinking several [[Japan]]ese ships, and was decorated with both the [[Silver Star]] and [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]].  After the war, he held a variety of commands, specializing in [[amphibious warfare]].  He led the 1965 [[U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic]].  He also served in several posts in Washington, including the [[Office of Legislative Affairs (United States Navy)|Legislative Affairs Office]] and [[CHINFO|Chief of Naval Information]], where he became influential in political affairs.  He was a staunch [[anti-Communist]], and was such an advocate of the importance of a strong naval presence that he became known as &quot;Mr. Seapower&quot;.

During the [[Vietnam War]], McCain was [[United States Pacific Command|Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC)]], commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater from 1968 to 1972.  He was a stalwart supporter of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s policy of [[Vietnamization]].  McCain played a significant role in the militarization of U.S. policy towards [[Cambodia]], helping to convince Nixon to launch the 1970 [[Cambodian Incursion]] and establishing a personal relationship with Cambodian leader [[Lon Nol]].  McCain was also a proponent of the [[Operation Lam Son 719|1971 incursion into Laos]].  McCain retired from the Navy in 1972.

His father, [[John S. McCain Sr.]], was also an admiral in the Navy and a [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviator]], and the two were the first father-son pair to achieve four-star rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;  His son, [[John McCain|John S. McCain III]], is a former naval aviator who was a [[Early life and military career of John McCain#Prisoner of war|prisoner of war in North Vietnam]] during McCain's time as CINCPAC, who retired with the rank of [[Captain (U.S. Navy)|captain]] and then became a [[United States Senator]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|2008 Republican Party]] nominee for [[President of the United States]]. 

==Early years, education and family==
McCain was born in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ddg56-namesake&quot;/&gt;  His father, a junior officer on the armored cruiser {{USS|Washington|ACR-11|6}}, was away at sea at the time, and his mother, the former Catherine Davey Vaulx, was traveling cross country to visit with her sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;ddg56-namesake&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccain.navy.mil/Site%20Pages/namesake3.aspx |title=USS John S.

Wilson Company]] | year=1943}} p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was called &quot;Jack&quot; by his family,&lt;ref name=&quot;ddg56-namesake&quot;/&gt; although he would also be called &quot;Junior&quot; by others, which he preferred less.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/30/AR2008083001786_pf.html | title=A Turbulent Youth Under a Strong Father's Shadow | author=Leahy, Michael | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=2008-08-31 | accessdate=2008-11-08 | authorlink=Michael Leahy (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His family's history of military service extended beyond his father&amp;mdash;his paternal uncle was [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[William Alexander McCain]]. His family tree also had other people engaged in military service, back through many wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', [http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/t/timberg-mccain.html pp. 17–34.]&lt;/ref&gt;

McCain grew up at various naval stations where his father was posted and then in [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]], going to local schools and working as a [[paperboy (newspaper delivery)|paperboy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-obit&quot;/&gt;  His father was away on duty for much of his childhood, and his mother did much of the parenting.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;  He graduated from [[Cardozo Senior High School|Central High School]] in the district.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/142613172.html?dids=142613172:142613172 | title=Adm. John S. McCain Jr. Dies; Leader in Vietnam War | author=Weil, Martin | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=1981-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCain entered the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1927, at age 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;ddg56-namesake&quot;/&gt;  He disliked the hazing tradition and behavioral restrictions of Annapolis, and accumulated many [[wikt:demerit|demerits]] and earned mediocre grades during his years at the Academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ddg56-namesake&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;  As one biographer wrote, McCain &quot;was given to taking unauthorized midnight leave and spent much of his four ... years in contention with authority and working off massive doses of extra duty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rd-hub&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| title=Adm. John S. (Jack) McCain: Sentinel of the Pacific | author=Hubbell, John G. | journal=[[Reader's Digest]] | date=March 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McCain later stated: &quot;I was known as a 'ratey' plebe, and that's the plebe who does not conform always to the specific rules and regulations of the upperclassmen. Some of these upperclassmen would ... require you to do such things which only incited rebellion and mutiny in me, see.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;  At one point, McCain had so many demerits he was at risk of not graduating; his partying and drinking was especially dangerous as it was taking place during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;  For much of his final year there, he was banished from [[Bancroft Hall]], the normal residence for midshipmen, and forced instead to live on the [[barracks ship]] {{USS|Reina Mercedes|IX-25|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;  He graduated in 1931, finishing 423rd out of 441 in class rank, nineteenth from the bottom.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-milrec&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--TODO Leahy says 424 out of 441, which is right? --&gt;

Upon graduation, he was commissioned an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] and assigned to duty aboard the battleship {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}} in the Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;ddg56-namesake&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds&quot;&gt;Reynolds, ''Famous American Admirals'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;  He applied to flight school to become a naval aviator, but was turned down due to a [[heart murmur]], and was accepted at Submarine School at [[Naval Submarine Base New London]] in [[Connecticut]] instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;ddg56-namesake&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds&quot;/&gt;  There he placed 28th out of 29 in his class.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-milrec&quot;/&gt;

While stationed on ''Oklahoma'' in [[Long Beach, California]], McCain met [[Roberta McCain|Roberta Wright]], a freshman at the [[University of Southern California]] whose father was a successful [[wildcatter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nw083008&quot;/&gt;  After Roberta's mother objected to her daughter associating with a sailor,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; the couple eloped to [[Tijuana, Mexico]], marrying in [[Caesar Cardini|Caesar's Bar]] on January 21, 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;nw083008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/156488 | title=Hidden Depths | author=Meacham, Jon | journal=[[Newsweek]]| date=2008-08-30 | accessdate=2008-09-04 | authorlink=Jon Meacham}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McCain was suspended five days for leaving ship without permission.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-milrec&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/05/30/records_shed_light_on_career_of_mccains_father/ |title=Records shed light on career of McCain's father |author=Quaid, Libby |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2008-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218002444/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/05/30/records_shed_light_on_career_of_mccains_father/ |archivedate=February 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple would have three children: [[Henry Sturgis Morgan Jr.#biography|Jean Alexandra &quot;Sandy&quot; McCain]] (born 1934), [[John McCain|John Sidney McCain III]] (born 1936 at [[Coco Solo|Coco Solo Naval Air Station]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]), and [[Joe McCain|Joseph Pinckney McCain II]] (born 1942 at Naval Submarine Base New London).&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nw083008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt060856&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The family was frequently uprooted as they followed McCain from New London to [[Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]], and other stations in the [[Pacific Ocean]];&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-19&quot;&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Roberta took on the lead role in raising the children.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;  In 1934, McCain was praised for loyalty and for performing his duties very well, but his fitness report said he suffered from nervousness, and he was treated for [[weight loss]] at [[Pearl Harbor Naval Hospital]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-milrec&quot;/&gt;  He served on the old, [[World War I]]-era submarines {{USS|S-45|SS-156|2}} and {{USS|R-13|SS-90|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ddg56-namesake&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds&quot;/&gt; From 1938 to 1940, he returned to the Naval Academy for a stint of teaching [[electrical engineering]] to midshipmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds&quot;/&gt; He later said of this position, &quot;The lads learned soon enough never to try to hoodwink an old hoodwinker.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-260&quot;&gt;Moritz (ed.), ''Current Biography Yearbook 1970'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1940 and early 1941, he sailed in the more modern {{USS|Skipjack|SS-184|2}}&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds&quot;/&gt; (commanded by [[Charles L. Freeman|Larry Freeman]])&lt;ref&gt;Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]'s [[Submarine Division 15|SubDiv 15]], under Captain [[Ralph Waldo Christie|Ralph Christie]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1941, McCain was detached to his first command, the antique {{USS|O-8|SS-69|2}}, recommissioned as a training boat at the Submarine School in New London.&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
After the 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], McCain would not see his family for long stretches.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;  By then a [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]], McCain was assigned to command the submarine {{USS|Gunnel|SS-253|2}}, joining her in May 1942 for trials and seeing the boat commissioned in August 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds&quot;/&gt;

''Gunnel'' was deployed as part of the November 1942 [[Operation Torch|invasion of French North Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds&quot;/&gt; Operating conditions for the five submarines sent there were not favorable, due to overcrowded waters, poor weather, and mixed-up signals, and the deployment had no accomplishments.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair-265&quot;/&gt; Like many other U.S. submarines, ''Gunnel'' was attacked in error by friendly aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair-265&quot;&gt;Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hooven-Owens-Rentschler]] (H.O.R.) diesels (known as &quot;whores&quot;) which powered ''Gunnel'' were troublesome; at one point while returning home, drive gears of all four of the main engines were out of commission, and McCain's crew had to rely on their tiny auxiliary engine for the last {{convert|1000|nmi|km}}. ''Gunnel'' went into the navy yard for an extensive refit&lt;ref name=&quot;blair-265&quot;/&gt; and was replaced on patrol station off North Africa by [[Willis Lent|&quot;Pilly&quot; Lent]]'s {{USS|Haddo|SS-255|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the refit, ''Gunnel'' was ordered to the Pacific Fleet, and in June 1943, went on patrol in the [[East China Sea|East China]] and [[Yellow Sea]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair-439&quot;/&gt;  On June 15, McCain torpedoed and sank the freighter ''Koyo Maru'' (6400 tons) in the [[Tsushima Strait]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blair-439&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cress-164&quot;&gt;Cressman, ''Official Chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War II'', pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early on June 19, McCain engaged a Japanese convoy that was headed for Shanghai.&lt;ref name=&quot;faith-86&quot;&gt;McCain and Salter, ''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 86–91.&lt;/ref&gt;  He torpedoed and sank the freighter ''Tokiwa Maru'' (7000 tons) and hit a smaller vessel.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair-439&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cress-164&quot;/&gt;  The convoy's escorts then staged a prolonged counter-attack on ''Gunnel'', dropping [[depth charge]]s that shook and damaged the boat and [[grappling hook]]s that rattled along its hull.&lt;ref name=&quot;faith-86&quot;/&gt;  Underwater for hours, sometimes near the seabottom, McCain surfaced; Japanese escorts fired shells at him as he stood on the bridge, while he fired torpedoes back, striking and sinking one (originally thought to be a destroyer, it was the coastal minesweeper ''Tsubame'').&lt;ref name=&quot;cress-164&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;faith-86&quot;/&gt;  McCain dove again and the Japanese ships continued in sonar-based pursuit.  After a total of 36 hours, nearly all spent underwater, ''Gunnel''{{'}}s batteries were about to fail and the air was very hot and virtually unbreathable.&lt;ref name=&quot;faith-86&quot;/&gt;  McCain surfaced in battle stations position, ready to engage in a disadvantageous gun battle with the Japanese pursuers, but they were heading in the opposite direction and he was able to escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;faith-86&quot;/&gt;  Persistent trouble from the submarine's diesel engines then cut short the patrol after only eleven days, after which McCain returned to [[Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blair-439&quot;&gt;Blair, ''Silent Victory'', pp. 439–440.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the reduced time, the freighter tonnage ''Gunnel'' sunk was the second-largest total for any of the sixteen U.S. submarines deployed into operational areas in the Pacific that month.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair-439&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer and Hümmelchen, ''Chronology of the War at Sea, 1939–1945'', pp. 328–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCain was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for this patrol, for &quot;conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action, as Commanding Officer of a submarine in enemy Japanese-controlled waters ... [and] bravery under fire and aggressive fighting spirit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;alex-13&quot;&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  McCain's personality was a good fit for wartime submarine duty.  Many of the U.S. submarine commanders trained in peacetime had focused excessively on conformance to regulations and adherence to official tactical doctrine; they lacked the aggressiveness and ability to improvise that the conflict in the Pacific demanded, and by the end of the first year of the war, almost a third of them had been relieved as inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Padfield | first=Peter |authorlink= Peter Padfield | title=War Beneath the Sea: Submarine Conflict in World War II | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | year=1995 | isbn=0-471-14624-2}} pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gunnel'' was the first Pearl Harbor boat to have her H.O.R. diesels replaced, and she returned to action off [[Iwo Jima]] in December 1943. Alerted by [[Station HYPO]] intelligence to the presence of [[aircraft carrier]]s, on the night of December 2–3, McCain fired four [[torpedo]]es at {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuihō||2}} at a very long range of {{convert|6000|yd|m}}, only to miss as ''Zuihō'' zigged.&lt;ref name=Blair_p527&gt;Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not hit it, McCain was one of only a handful of U.S. submarine commanders to actually attack an enemy carrier.  ''Gunnel'' did sink one ship of 4000 tons during this patrol.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer and Hümmelchen, ''Chronology of the War at Sea, 1939–1945'', p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McCainFatherandGrandfather.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Jack&quot; McCain alongside his father, [[John S. McCain Sr.|Admiral John S. &quot;Slew&quot; McCain Sr.]], on board a U.S. Navy ship in [[Tokyo Bay]], September 2, 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-milrec&quot;/&gt;]]
On March 18, 1944, on patrol off [[Tawi Tawi]], the main Japanese fleet anchorage in the [[Philippines]], McCain got another shot at a carrier. He fired from extremely long range {{convert|9000|yd|m}}, missed the target, and sustained a counterattack of sixteen [[depth charges]]. He tried to attack the same carrier over the next four days, but could place his boat no closer than {{convert|5|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref name=Blair_p582&gt;Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the May 1944 U.S. air strike on [[Surabaya]], ''Gunnel'' lay off Tawi Tawi in company with [[Robert I. Olsen|Robert Olsen]]'s {{USS|Angler|SS-240|2}}, but McCain managed no attacks on Japanese ships. He shifted his operations to the coast of [[Indochina]], where, on June 8, he picked up a convoy, escorted by yet another aircraft carrier. He was unable to approach closer than {{convert|15|nmi|km}}.  In July 1944, he was detached for a brief return to New London.&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds&quot;/&gt;

At the conclusion of the war, McCain sailed ''Dentuda'' into [[Tokyo Bay]] and had one last meeting with his father, who had been commanding the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] during the latter stages of the war.

In addition to his Silver and Bronze Stars, McCain's actions in the war earned him two letters of commendation.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-260&quot;/&gt;  A superior wrote that: &quot;His zeal in the investigation and development of new submarine tactics and weapons has been outstanding.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-milrec&quot;/&gt;

In 1964 McCain was elected an hereditary member of the Virginia [[Society of the Cincinnati]] by right of his descent from his great(4) grandfather Captain John Young who served with the Virginia State Troops during the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Roster of the Society of the Cincinnati. 1974. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1965, McCain led the [[United States invasion of the Dominican Republic]] as commander of [[Task Force 124]],&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds-209&quot;/&gt; which maintained a military occupation until civil unrest had ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-260&quot;/&gt;  McCain later said, &quot;Some people condemned this as an 'unwarranted intervention,' but the Communists were all set to move in and take over. People may not love you for being strong when you have to be, but they respect you for it and learn to behave themselves when you are.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-260&quot;/&gt;  He also worked closely with [[U.S. Ambassador]] to the [[Organization of American States]] [[Ellsworth Bunker]], who was handling negotiations between local factions.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;  For this operation, McCain was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-260&quot;/&gt;

McCain then served three roles simultaneously: vice chairman of delegation to the [[United Nations]] [[Military Staff Committee]], Commander [[Eastern Sea Frontier]], and Commander [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds-209&quot;/&gt;  The U.N. post was considered to be a career dead-end, but McCain looked to his political contacts to keep his career going.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;salon-lbj&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/10/29/admiral_mccain/index.html | title=Is McCain a competent fellow? | author=Brune, Tom | publisher=''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' | date=2008-10-29 | accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCain and Salter, ''Faith of My Fathers'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice Admiral McCain, by his enthusiasm, honesty and delightful personality makes many friends, not only officially but socially.... The 'little man with the big cigar' is known to everyone.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-milrec&quot;/&gt;  McCain liked to confer with enlisted men and get their opinions.&lt;ref name=&quot;rd-hub&quot;/&gt;  He swore so much he earned the sobriquet &quot;Good Goddamn McCain&quot;; his regular greeting to begin the day was &quot;Good goddamn morning.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;  He was often asked how he told his wife Roberta and her identical twin sister Rowena apart, to which he famously responded by puffing his cigar, flashing a grin, and saying, &quot;That's their problem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;  He [[jump rope|jumped rope]] 200 times a day as part of keeping fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-obit&quot;/&gt;  He developed a problem with [[alcoholism]] during his career, and cut back on his drinking so that it did not interfere with his ability to command or show up on fitness reports, although he occasionally suffered lapses.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-milrec&quot;/&gt;

McCain was a staunch promoter of the importance of a strong naval presence,&lt;ref name=&quot;ns-32&quot;/&gt; and indeed became known in military-congressional circles, sometimes not approvingly, as &quot;Mr. Seapower&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCain and Salter, ''Faith of My Fathers'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  He gave regular speeches on the subject with an increasing fervor, and worked with his large number of political contacts in what some saw as an effort to get a final promotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;  During the [[Cold War]], McCain stressed the importance of maintaining naval superiority over the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time-obit&quot;/&gt;  He was especially concerned in light of the growing number of submarines deployed by the [[Soviet Navy]], calling them &quot;a direct threat to our free use of the oceans of the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time-obit&quot;/&gt;  During a long U.S. policy debate regarding the merchant marine force, he continued to stress the importance of that fleet, giving an illustrated talk entitled &quot;Total Wet War&quot; that said the Soviets would soon overtake the fleet in numbers and concluding that &quot;our free use of the seas will play an ever increasing role in the world situation of the future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70813FB3859117B93C5A8178DD85F428685F9 | title=Maritime Debate Called Divisive | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1966-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1965, Senate Minority Leader Dirksen had been championing McCain's case for [[four-star admiral]] promotion to President [[Lyndon Johnson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;salon-lbj&quot;/&gt;  McCain had both supporters and detractors within the Navy, but the top commanders had sidetracked him with the U.N. appointment, and [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] had been given the impression that McCain was not a strong commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon-lbj&quot;/&gt;  Johnson owed Dirksen for having broken the filibuster of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and so in 1966, Johnson requested that McNamara find a four-star path for McCain.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon-lbj&quot;/&gt;

==Vietnam War==
In February 1967, McCain received his sought-after promotion to admiral (which became effective in May), and became [[United States Naval Forces Europe|Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe (CINCUSNAVEUR)]], stationed in [[London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_AP_19670225&gt;

McCain continued to expand on his vision of the Soviet threat, saying that the Soviets' maritime goal &quot;encompasses not only the military uses of the sea, but also those relating to world politics, economics, commerce and technology,&quot; and likened its propaganda value to the [[Space Race]].&lt;ref name=NYT_Arnold_19680125&gt;{{cite news

When the [[Nixon Administration]] took office in January 1969, the secret [[National Security Study Memorandum]] 1 collected views of top officials on the prospects for President [[Richard Nixon]]'s policy of [[Vietnamization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hk-50&quot;/&gt; There was a division of thought among those contributing, but McCain was one of those who were relatively optimistic, believing the North Vietnamese had entered peace talks due to military weakness, South Vietnamese pacification progress was real, and the tide of the war was favorably turning.&lt;ref name=&quot;hk-50&quot;&gt;Kissinger, ''Ending the Vietnam War'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  McCain suffered a mild [[stroke]] around this time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0F15F63C5E147493C7A8178AD85F4D8685F9 | title=Adm.

| title=Agnew Says Nixon Won't Press Thieu | author=Naughton, James M. 
| work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1969-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McCain did not give much credence to the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]]; in reaction to the popular slogan &quot;[[Make love, not war]],&quot; he told a 1970 Naval Academy class that they were part of a fraternity &quot;whose members are men enough to do both.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-obit&quot;/&gt;

McCain played an important part in the expansion of U.S. involvement in [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shawcross-136&quot;/&gt;  In April 1970, McCain gave personal briefings to Nixon in Honolulu, and to Nixon and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] in [[San Clemente]],&lt;ref name=&quot;reeves-192&quot;/&gt; where he highlighted the threat from North Vietnamese operations in Cambodia and [[Laos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hk-145&quot;/&gt;  In particular, he said that [[Lon Nol]]'s government in Cambodia would soon collapse unless North Vietnamese operations there were stopped, and that with a secure base there, North Vietnam could then launch attacks on South Vietnam which would cause the failure of Vietnamization.&lt;ref name=&quot;reeves-192&quot;/&gt;  McCain additionally said that the schedule for the ongoing withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from Vietnam had to be flexible.&lt;ref name=&quot;hk-145&quot;&gt;Kissinger, ''Ending the Vietnam War'', pp. 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt;  McCain's views, which had the support of his subordinate, MACV commander General [[Creighton Abrams]], helped persuade Nixon to go ahead with the [[Cambodian Incursion]] later that month.&lt;ref name=&quot;hk-145&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reeves-193&quot;&gt;Reeves, ''President Nixon'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kissinger would subsequently tell another admiral, &quot;We have to be careful about having McCain around the president too much, because he fires up the president.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;

[[File:JohnSMcCainJr 4star.jpg|thumb|left|upright|McCain as a four-star admiral]]
By fall 1970, McCain worried that Kissinger's plan for extensive commitment of [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese troops]] to preserve the Cambodian regime would endanger the progress of Vietnamization.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, ''Sideshow'', p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, McCain was involved in the intense U.S. effort to prop up Cambodian leader [[Lon Nol]], paying visits to [[Phnom Penh]] to give him assurances and assess the state of the Cambodians.&lt;ref name=&quot;shawcross-187&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00A14F63D5B117B93C7A9178BD95F448785F9 | title=U.S. Admiral Tours Pnompenh | work=[[The New York Times]]| date=1970-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Lon Nol suffered a stroke in early 1971, he recuperated at McCain's guesthouse in Honolulu.&lt;ref name=&quot;shawcross-187&quot;&gt;Shawcross, ''Sideshow'', pp. 167, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, a Military Equipment Delivery Team program was organized to supply military assistance to the Cambodian government.  McCain gained control of this effort (instead of [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]]), and to support a conflict that he proprietarily spoke of as &quot;my war&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, ''Sideshow'', pp. 169, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; made constant requests to the Pentagon for more arms and staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;shawcross-191&quot;&gt;Shawcross, ''Sideshow'', pp. 190–192.&lt;/ref&gt;  He forced an Americanization of many logistics procedures within the Cambodian military.&lt;ref name=&quot;shawcross-191&quot;/&gt;  He sided with Kissinger and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] as they prevailed over the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia and [[U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[Melvin Laird]] in adopting a militarization of American policy with regard to that country.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, ''Sideshow'', pp. 194–195, 198–199.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lon Nol's gratitude towards McCain continued, including the gift of an elephant (soon named &quot;Cincpachyderm&quot;) too large to transport on McCain's [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00614F83D591A7493C6A8178AD95F458785F9 | title=U.S. Packing a Trunk, With Elephant Attached | agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1971-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCain was also very concerned about the North Vietnamese presence in [[Laos]].&lt;ref name=NYT_Holloran_19700301&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30D10FF3D5B137A93C3A91788D85F448785F9 | title=Communist Challenge in Laos; Laos 2: Fear Test Of the Nixon Doctrine | author=Holloran, Bernard | work=[[The New York Times]]| date=1970-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a proponent of [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the February–March 1971 U.S.-assisted incursion into southeastern Laos by the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese Army]].  He told Admiral [[Thomas Moorer]], chairman of the Joint Chiefs, that an offensive against the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] might compel Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]], prime minister of Laos, &quot;to abandon the guise of neutrality and enter the war openly.&quot;&lt;ref name=Nalty2005_p247&gt;{{cite book | last=Nalty | first=Bernard C. | title=The War Against Trucks: Aerial Interdiction in Southern Laos, 1968–1972 | publisher=[[Air Force History and Museums Program]] | year=2005|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The operation ended in failure.

Each year while Jack McCain was CINCPAC, he paid a Christmastime visit to the American troops in [[South Vietnam]] serving closest to the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]]; he would stand alone and look north, to be as close to his son as he could get.&lt;ref name=&quot;ff-287&quot;&gt;McCain and Salter, ''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 287–288. John McCain states he has received dozens of reports over the years of his father going near the DMZ to do this.&lt;/ref&gt;  During [[Operation Linebacker]], the resumed bombing of the north starting in April 1972, the targets included the Hanoi area.  The daily orders were issued by McCain, knowing his imprisoned son was in the vicinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-106&quot;&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1972, the Nixon administration announced Admiral [[Noel Gayler]] as McCain's successor as CINCPAC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50714F63F591A7493C7A81788D85F468785F9 | title=Admiral for Pacific | author=Van Gelder, Lawrence | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1972-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite McCain's unheeded request to Nixon to have his tour extended so that he could see the war to its conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ff-287&quot;/&gt;  McCain's time as CINCPAC ended on September 1, 1972;&lt;ref name=&quot;upi110272&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Frankum | first=Ronald Bruce | title=Like Rolling Thunder: The Air War In Vietnam 1964–1975 | publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-7425-4302-1}} p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; at the transfer of command ceremony in Honolulu that day,&lt;ref name=&quot;upi110272&quot;/&gt; President Nixon focused on the contributions of the three generations of McCains – saying, &quot;In the story of the McCains we see the greatness of America&quot; – and awarded McCain a [[award star|gold star]] in lieu of his second [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nixon72&quot;&gt;{{cite speech | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3556 | title=Remarks at a Ceremony Marking the Retirement of Admiral John S.

Zumwalt Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds-209&quot;/&gt;

Kissinger would later characterize McCain's approach to the Vietnam War by saying, &quot;He fought for the victory that his instinct and upbringing demanded and that political reality forbade.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hk-145&quot;/&gt;

==Retirement and death==
Admiral McCain retired on November 1, 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;upi110272&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30F1EF83A591A7493C0A9178AD95F468785F9 | title=Adm. M'Cain Retires After 41-Year Tour | agency=[[United Press International]] |work=[[The New York Times]]| date=1972-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was no ceremony, as it would have been redundant after the one that took place two months earlier in Hawaii; as one associate said, &quot;He just didn't come to work today.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;upi110272&quot;/&gt;

McCain visited the [[White House]] in 1975 and discussed naval preparedness issues with President [[Gerald Ford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-obit&quot;/&gt;  During the late 1970s, McCain sometimes acted as an advisor on military matters to [[Ronald Reagan]], who was preparing for [[United States presidential election, 1980|his third presidential candidacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Skinner, Kiron K. | coauthors=Anderson, Annelise; Anderson, Martin Anderson (eds.) | title=Reagan: A Life in Letters | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year=2004 | isbn=0-7432-1967-8}} p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Buckley | first=William F. | authorlink=William F. Buckley | title=Miles Gone by: A Literary Autobiography | publisher=[[Regnery Publishing]] | year=2004 | isbn=0-89526-089-1}} p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;  McCain also participated in a January 1978 traveling &quot;Panama Canal Truth Squad&quot;, led by Senator [[Paul Laxalt]], that sought Senate rejection of the [[Panama Canal Treaty]]; McCain felt that the eventual ceding of the canal to Panamanian control would endanger U.S. security and provide an opening to the Soviets in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50817FE3B5A13728DDDA90994D9405B888BF1D3 | title=Canal 'Truth Squad' Plans a 5-Day Blitz | author=Hovey, Graham | work=[[The New York Times]]| date=1978-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But overall, McCain felt despair over his reluctant retirement from the United States Navy and fell into prolonged poor health.&lt;ref name=&quot;wtff-3&quot;&gt;McCain and Salter, ''Worth the Fighting For'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; His son John felt his father's &quot;long years of binge drinking&quot; had caught up with him, despite a mostly successful later recovery in [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wtff-3&quot;/&gt;

McCain died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on a military aircraft en route from Europe on March 22, 1981, with his wife at his side.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wtff-3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The plane landed at [[Bangor, Maine]], where his death was confirmed, and then went on to [[Andrews Air Force Base]] outside of Washington. See ''Worth the Fighting For'', p. 5. This has led some web sources to inaccurately report the place of death as Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on March 27, 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;nw083008&quot;/&gt;

==Namesakes==
{{USS|John S. McCain|DDG-56}} was named for both Admirals McCain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ddg56-namesake&quot;/&gt;

McCain was written about extensively in his son John's 1999 memoir ''[[Faith of My Fathers]]''.  McCain was portrayed by actor [[Scott Glenn]] in the 2005 [[Faith of My Fathers (film)|television movie adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/29/AR2005052901099.html | title='Faith of My Fathers': In Principle, a Noble Effort | author=Davis, Marcia | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=2005-05-30 | accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grandson John S. &quot;Jack&quot; McCain IV attended and graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 2009, the fourth-generation John S. McCain to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090522/ap_on_go_pr_wh/us_obama_naval_academy |title=Obama vows not to send people to war without cause |author=Superville, Darlene |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Yahoo!
