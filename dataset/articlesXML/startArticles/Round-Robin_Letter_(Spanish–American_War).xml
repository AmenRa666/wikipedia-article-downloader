      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4878">The '''Round-Robin Letter''' is the name of an incident in the [[United States Army]] that occurred between July 28 and August 3, 1898, during the [[Spanish–American War]]. After disease incapacitated thousands of Army soldiers in the wake of the [[Siege of Santiago]], high-ranking officers of [[Fifth Army Corps (Spanish-American War)|Fifth Army Corps]] drafted a [[Round-robin (document)|round-robin letter]] demanding that the unit be sent back to the United States. Public release of the letter publicly embarrassed the U.S. government.

==About the incident==
By July 28, 1898, [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]] were [[pandemic]] among U.S. Army troops [[garrison]]ed near [[Santiago de Cuba]] on the island of [[Cuba]]. Fifth Corps, to which the [[Rough Riders]] was attached, had 4,270 men seriously ill (and dying), and corps commanders feared the unit could be wiped out if it stayed in Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintermute558&quot;&gt;Wintermute, p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[William McKinley|McKinley administration]], however, planned to keep the corps in Cuba until peace negotiations with Spain concluded. Public opinion was also against bringing home an army infected with yellow fever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golay104&quot;&gt;Golay, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several senior officers met with [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[William Rufus Shafter|William R. Shafter]], commander of Fifth Corps, and unanimously asked that the corps be withdrawn to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golay104&quot; /&gt; It is unclear whether Shafter agreed and asked for this in writing, or whether Shafter disagreed and the corps commanders decided to put their request in writing. Colonel [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (commander of the First Volunteer US Cavalry Rough Riders), the only non-general officer of the group, was asked by the rest of the group to draft a round-robin letter outlining the problems with living conditions and disease to send to Army Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The letter would also be deliberately leaked to the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintermute558&quot; /&gt;

As a volunteer, Roosevelt's career would not be at stake in the way a regular army officer's would be by the communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golay105&quot; /&gt; (Some sources say there is doubt that Roosevelt was the author,&lt;ref name=&quot;RoundRobin584&quot; /&gt; while others say that Roosevelt was only the author of the abridged letter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golay105&quot;&gt;Golay, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;) Nine generals and Roosevelt signed the letter.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoundRobin584&quot; /&gt; An abridged version was given to Shafter to present to the [[United States Secretary of War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintermute558&quot; /&gt; Shafter declined to do so, but did communicate with his superiors about what was happening.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoundRobin584&quot;&gt;&quot;Round Robin&quot;, in ''Historical Dictionary of the Spanish American War'', p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter was deliberately leaked to [[Associated Press]] correspondents at corps headquarters, who cabled it to the U.S., where it was published nationwide. Publication of the round-robin letter turned public opinion against the [[United States Department of War|War Department]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RoundRobin584&quot; /&gt;

The McKinley administration was outraged by the leaking of the round-robin letter, but quickly realized that the public would blame the government. The administration acted swiftly to try to defuse the situation. On July 28, Secretary of War [[Russell A. Alger]] [[Telegraphy|cabled]] Shafter and ordered Fifth Corps home to [[Theodore Roosevelt County Park|Camp Wikoff]] on [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], for [[quarantine]] and [[Military discharge|mustering out]]. On August 3, the day before the letter appeared in the press, Alger ordered construction of barracks at Camp Wikoff to begin and for [[United States Navy]] ships to head to Cuba to retrieve Fifth Corps. The first units departed on August 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintermute558&quot; /&gt; Alger claimed that the round-robin letter did not accelerate administration plans to repatriate the corps. This appears disingenuous, however, as Alger had long asserted that naval ships were unavailable to bring the troops home.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 283, fn. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
