In the WW1 article it is said that &quot;Three days later the Austrians retreated across the Danube, having suffered 21,000 casualties as against 16,000 Serbian. This marked the first major Allied victory of the war.&quot; And here that Austria-Hungary lost 30,000. Which one ist correct? [[User:Latre|Latre]]

:According to Serbian historian Savo Skoko and his book &quot;Vojvoda Stepa Stepanović&quot;, around 23.000 is the correct number.

Potiorek suicide?

Someone added in &quot;Potiorek was stripped of his command and later commited suicide after this key defeat.&quot; He was obviously still in command at the later battle of Kolubara, which was when he was demoted, and he died in 1933. He was suicidal after Cer and Kolubara, but he didn't go through with it. ELV

''Amongst the Serbian officers that died during the battle, was infantry major Kursula , who led one of the most crucial charges. He held his saber, and as all Serbian officers, was the first in front of his soldiers, with a taunt :&quot; All after me! Long live the King! Long live Serbia. He survived five charges just to be killed by recessive artillery fire at the very end of the battle, when , already wounded in the head, he got hit by a piece of the exploded grenade. One of the interesting things about him is that, before the war, on the high officer exam that he took to become the general, he first brought out the possibility that Austrian army could and most likely will attack over the river Drina, while trying to deceive Serbian high command by the attack of one of their armies from the north. That was just what happened, and Serbian high officers also saw through Austrian deception, but general Stepa Stepanović, the hero of the battle of Cer , who had also foreseen Pochorek's plan, has rejected that theory in the time Major Kursula brought it, telling him that it is not tactically wise from the Austrians, because of the terrain. He then denied Kursula the rank of the general.Just couple months after, he too came out with the same idea. KR3W''

This whole section is based upon some scenes from the movie &quot;Marš na Drinu&quot;. These are not historical facts. I suggest to whoever added this to the article to grow up.

== Needs a rewrite ==
Some aspects of this article suggest that it needs a rewrite, namely:

1) It is written in broken English;
2) It has a POV tone suggesting Serbian bias; and
3) It has almost no information about the actual battle itself.

I'd suggest that it be looked at in order to remedy these problems by someone knowledgeable about the battle.  Thanks. [[User:216.83.83.166|216.83.83.166]] 14:23, 20 September 2007 (UTC)

== WikiProject class rating ==
This article was automatically assessed because at least one WikiProject had rated the article as start, and the rating on other projects was brought up to start class. [[User:BetacommandBot|BetacommandBot]] 08:57, 10 November 2007 (UTC)


I agree that this page needs a re-write: 
Broken English
Focuses almost entirely on 2 Serbian commanders
Creates &quot;if they had done this this would have happened&quot; passages
PS Why is this linked to Serbia but not Austria?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.217.61.18|62.217.61.18]] ([[User talk:62.217.61.18|talk]]) 14:24, 8 February 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Don't Forget Montenegro ==
I did some research and found some info. that Montenegro gave 3,000 troops to assist Serbia in fighting Austria-Hungary in the battle. I did not find that in the article. I also found that about 500 Greek troops also assisted in the battle, even though only 300 actualy fought. I did not find that in the article either.-Apr.30,08  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.190.216.182|66.190.216.182]] ([[User talk:66.190.216.182|talk]]) 01:21, 1 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Can you show us your sources so that we can assess them? Greek was neutral and Montenegro under threat of attack itself.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vagabund|Vagabund]] ([[User talk:Vagabund|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Vagabund|contribs]]) 13:15, 5 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Marš na Drinu ==
Shouldn't this movie be mentioned somewhere in the article? It reffers to the battle of Cer. --[[User talk:PrimEviL|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;P&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;rim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;L&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:45, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

== unclear... ==
This line is not clear to me: &quot;The battle was part of the first Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia, and erupted on the night of 15 August when elements of the '''1st Combined Division encountered Austro-Hungarian outposts on the slopes of Cer Mountain.''' The clashes that followed escalated into a battle for control over several towns and villages near the mountain, especially Šabac.&quot; (bold mine) - shouldn't it have encountered serbian outposts if it was an invasion of serbia? Just double checking, because the same line is repeated later in the article. [[User:Peregrine981|Peregrine981]] ([[User talk:Peregrine981|talk]]) 14:25, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
:: Jordan clearly says the outposts were Austro-Hungarian. It would seem they were set up during the Austro-Hungarian invasion which had begun a few days prior. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 17:37, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
:::ok. It is clearer now. Was just a bit odd that the &quot;outposts&quot; would be those of the invader. [[User:Peregrine981|Peregrine981]] ([[User talk:Peregrine981|talk]]) 21:04, 8 July 2013 (UTC)

== languages ==
another point that jumps out at me is that we only cite the Serbian name of the battle. I cannot find any guidance on which languages to include for battle names, but it would seem to me logical to also include the German+Hungarian names. Or is it only usual to include the name in the language of the place it was fought? This is a somewhat politically sensitive point, but it would seem fair to include the name in the main languages of the two sides involved. (clearly it would be too much to include all of the languages of the Empire). [[User:Peregrine981|Peregrine981]] ([[User talk:Peregrine981|talk]]) 16:43, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
:: I'll add the German name. If you know what the Hungarian name is then please feel free to add it. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 17:41, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
:::Can't say that I do, but I'll try to see if I can find it. [[User:Peregrine981|Peregrine981]] ([[User talk:Peregrine981|talk]]) 21:03, 8 July 2013 (UTC)</text>
