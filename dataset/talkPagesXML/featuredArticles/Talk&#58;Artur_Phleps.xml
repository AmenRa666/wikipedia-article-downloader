== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Artur Phleps]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=712843219 my edit]. You may add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it, if I keep adding bad data, but formatting bugs should be reported instead. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether, but should be used as a last resort. I made the following changes:

== Roland Kaltenegger and Otto Kumm ==

This featured article uses [[Otto Kumm]]'s history of the 7th SS-Mountain Division and Roland Kaltenegger's ''Totenkopf und Edelweiss'' (2008) as references. Both are well known apologists of Nazi war crimes. While I assume that SS-Brigadeführer Kumm's role as commander of the &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; and his later involvement with the HIAG is well known, I may quote how Michael Wedekind, in his study of Nazi occupation of Northern Italy (''Nationalsozialistische Besatzungs- und Annexionspolitik in Norditalien 1943-1945'', Munich 2003), characterized a Kaltenegger book of 1993: &quot;The explosiveness of this work with its striking proximity to National Socialism lies with the intended downplaying-apologetic defibration of historical events up to a sometimes redundant-episodic degree, thereby overriding central and characteristic aspects of not only the national socialist policy of occupation and annexation, but also of the fight against partisans, which is the central topic. (''Die Brisanz der Arbeit mit ihrer auffälligen Nähe zum Nationalsozialismus liegt in der verharmlosend-apologetischen intentionierten Zerfaserung historischer Vorgänge ins bisweilen Redundant-Episodenhafte und damit in der Überspielung zentraler und wesenhafter Aspekte der nationalsozialistischen Okkupations- und Annexionspolitik ebenso wie der thematisch in den Mittelpunkt gerückten Partisanenbekämpfung.'' (p. 8))

The article does not make use, however, of Thomas Casagrande's PhD thesis: ''Die volksdeutsche SS-Division &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;''. Campus, Frankfurt/M. 2003, or of Paul Milata's: ''Zwischen Hitler, Stalin und Antonescu: Rumäniendeutsche in der Waffen-SS''. Böhlau, Cologne 2007, 2nd ed. 2009. I consider that a serious shortcoming, because Phleps' guidelines and orders and therefore his imminent responsibility for the ruthless warfare his division waged against civillians remain unexplored. Instead, it is claimed, according to no one other than Kumm, that the division killed 2,000 &quot;Partisans&quot; during Case White and another 250 during Case Black, while it is by now a well established fact that the Germans counted civilian victims as partisans. (see, e.g., Casagrande, op. cit., p. 255)--[[User:Assayer|Assayer]] ([[User talk:Assayer|talk]]) 16:31, 9 November 2016 (UTC)
:Kumm's book (and Kaltenegger's for that matter) is used for unremarkable aspects of Phleps career and basic facts about movements of the division and similar information, and is compared, contrasted and in some cases corroborated by other sources like Lumans. There is nothing remarkable about that. I will see what Partisan sources say about casualties during Case White. Frankly, what you consider a serious shortcoming (here and elsewhere), often based on German-language sources not readily available, is questionable. This is not a dissertation. If you think that there are issues with this article, instead of criticising it, why don't you add those sources and improve it? You know, add content? That's what WP is about, not high-handed carping about the work of others. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67|click to talk to me]]) 00:14, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
::You may not have noticed, but I do add content where I think it might not be controversial, like, e.g., to [[Kurt Mälzer]]. By just adding some marginal information to the Panzer ace article, however, I ran into a content dispute already. Besides, I am a not a native English speaker so that, despite some proficiency with the language, I am more hesitant to edit articles than talk pages. I noticed that you mentioned your strong interest in this article and on your user page you state that you are always interested in a serious discussion on any article you have edited. So I figured it would be appropriate and welcome to carry things to the talk page first. Frankly, if I'd just substituted Kaltenegger and Kumm, would you've quietly condoned that? I also think, that it is important to point out the problems of certain literature to raise awareness of its quality. Strangely enough, despite residing in Germany with easy access to a couple of libraries I find it much more difficult to get hold of copies of the German-language books by Kumm, Bergel, and Kaltenegger than of those by Casagrande and Milata. I can even access previews of the latter at google books, which may be different from another country, I don't know. But yes, I consider it to be a serious shortcoming, if Kaltenegger is used, while Casagrande is ignored, even though it's just an FA article of Wikipedia. --[[User:Assayer|Assayer]] ([[User talk:Assayer|talk]]) 18:46, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
:::I edit in multi-language space regarding Yugoslavia most of the time, and I've heard that argument for not editing in article space many times before. I'm sorry, it just doesn't wash with me, if you are here to contribute to the encyclopaedia. In any case, your English is just fine. What that approach often results in is tendentious talk page discussions where one editor points out perceived flaws in an article, yet never even bothers to add material to the article to address the points they raise. People have been justifiably sanctioned for that behaviour in the past. Having been drawn into these things over the years, I refuse to engage in those discussions anymore, so if you want to improve the article, edit in article space like the rest of us. Casagrande isn't &quot;ignored&quot;, in fact I'm dismayed that anyone would think that I ignored a reliable source for any reason. I'm not familiar with what he has to say about Phleps, as you are familiar with him, and have access to him, you are at liberty to add all the material you wish from him, so long as it is within the scope of the article, which is Phleps himself. I'll also add that I don't own the article, the community does, and it has to meet community standards, which it was found to meet when it was promoted to FA. Of course there will be German-language sources that haven't been used, but that isn't because they've been &quot;ignored&quot;, it is because they are offline and/or I was not aware of them when I wrote the article, or because working from German for prolonged periods hurts my brain and I thought the article was sufficiently comprehensive. Also, what you are failing to recognise is that sources need to be &quot;reliable for the material they are being used to support&quot;. Do you have any sources that contradict any of the almost completely unremarkable biographical material sourced to Kumm and Kaltenegger? None of it is exceptional, which would of course require an exceptional source. If not, why would they be unreliable for that information, and why would you remove them or the material they are used for? [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67|click to talk to me]]) 02:53, 11 November 2016 (UTC)
::::Let me put it this way, I have made my own experiences and heard certain arguments, like &quot;this is not a dissertation&quot;, plenty of times before.  I am more critical with FAs than with regular ones. I have added some content referenced to Casagrande. The Kosutica massacre is one of the best known war crimes of the Waffen-SS. I brought it up, because it fell within Phleps' responsibility as commander of the V SS Mountain Corps and he was also called upon by Himmler to investigate it. Feel free to do some copy editing. There is more material, but it will take me some time to add that to the article. I have already pointed out where I think that it is particularly problematic to refer to Kumm's divisional history.  From FAs in the German Wikipedia I am also used to bibliographical overviews. You know, what do historians say about the subject? I have also seen that with other FAs in the English Wkipedia, but it does not seem to be common standard. The problem is that If you use Kumm and Kaltenegger like any other source, even if it's only &quot;for almost completely unremarkable biographical material&quot;, you invoke the impression that they are as respected as any other source. But in fact, both are strongly biased and historians refer to them only while carefully pointing to their shortcomings.--[[User:Assayer|Assayer]] ([[User talk:Assayer|talk]]) 20:23, 11 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::That is exactly the point. Sources are not equal, that is obvious. On WP, they just need to be reliable for what they are being used for. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67|click to talk to me]]) 06:29, 13 November 2016 (UTC)

{{od}}
Regarding the use of [[WP:QS]] sources mentioned above, some of the statements they are supporting are controversial, including:

*....despite his disdain for the corruption, intrigue and hypocrisy of the royal court.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|pp=100–101}} 
*After (...) publicly calling King Carol a liar when another general tried to twist his words...{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=101}}
*[Operation ''Kopaonik''] ...ended with little success, as the Chetniks had forewarning of the operation and were able to avoid contact.{{sfn|Kumm|1995|pp=27–28}}
*Otto Kumm claims that the 7th SS Division &lt;s&gt;captured [[Bihać]] and [[Bosanski Petrovac]],&lt;/s&gt; killed over 2,000 Partisans and captured nearly 400 during Case White,.{{sfn|Kumm|1995|pp=30–40}}
*The division was committed to [[Case Black]] &lt;s&gt;in May and June 1943, during which it advanced from the [[Mostar]] area into the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]]&lt;/s&gt; and killed, according to Kumm, 250 Partisans and captured over 500.{{sfn|Kumm|1995|pp=43–53}}
{{reflist-talk}}

I also believe that [[WP:FRINGE]] applies, i.e. statements from fringe sources should be reported only if they are noticed by independent reliable sources. In Kumm's case, I consider his account to be a primary, non-independent source. 

Some of the material cited to these sources is (in my definition) &quot;intricate detail&quot;, such as:
*After finishing at the Lutheran ''[[Realschule]]'' school in Hermannstadt...{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=96}} 
*In November 1940, with the support of the leader of the ''Volksgruppe in Rumänien'' (ethnic Germans in Romania), Andreas Schmidt, Phleps had written to the key ''Waffen-SS'' recruiting officer ''SS-[[Brigadeführer|Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS]]'' (Brigadier) [[Gottlob Berger]] offering his services to the Third Reich. Phleps subsequently asked for permission to leave Romania to join the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', and this was approved by the recently installed Romanian ''[[Conducător]]'' (dictator) General [[Ion Antonescu]].{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=101}}
* ...was presented to his son, ''[[SS-Obersturmführer]]'' (First Lieutenant) Dr.med. Reinhart Phleps...{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=105}} 
*One of Phleps' brothers became a doctor, and the other was a professor at the [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] technical university, now [[Gdańsk University of Technology]].{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=96}}

{{reflist-talk}}

In this case, I would argue that inclusion of this detail amounts to [[WP:NOT|indiscriminate collection of information]] -- if a particular development was important, then surely reliable sources would have taken note of that, and questionable publications would not be needed. If no reliable source report these developments, then they could be omitted as not adding much to the article: i.e. is it necessary to include which secondary school and where the subject graduated from?

I thus suggest that such sources be minimized or replaced wherever possible. [[User:K.e.coffman|K.e.coffman]] ([[User talk:K.e.coffman|talk]]) 03:25, 14 November 2016 (UTC)
:I wondered how long it would be until you showed up. I disagree with both aspects of your comments. I will not be able to respond properly for several days, as I away from a computer. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67|click to talk to me]]) 03:31, 14 November 2016 (UTC)

::Yes, I've edited this article before and have it on my watch list. I've also questioned the use of Kumm and similar sources before, see for example: [[Talk:Helmuth von Pannwitz#Nikolai Tolstoy]] and [[Talk:Joachim Peiper#Agte]]. Looking forward to a response. [[User:K.e.coffman|K.e.coffman]] ([[User talk:K.e.coffman|talk]]) 03:36, 14 November 2016 (UTC)

:::Now that I am back at a computer, I don't have a whole lot to add. Firstly, your claims about what is and what is not controversial are completely wrong-headed. For example, the 7th SS Div either did or did not capture Bihać, and did or did not advance from Mostar into the Italian governorate of Montenegro. Do you have any evidence they did not? These statements are entirely uncontroversial, and able to be backed up by other sources. If your issue is with casualty figures, in what way are these specific casualty figures controversial? What differing sources do &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt; have for those operations? Secondly, what you refer to as &quot;intricate detail&quot; is pretty standard for a biographical article of this size, and quite unremarkable in terms of the reason for its inclusion. For example, if you look at the (randomly selected) FA biography of [[:George S. Patton]] you will see information about the month and year of birth of his children, the fact he was home schooled, where he went to school etc, his belief in re-incarnation etc. All quite normal for a bio article on a general, or anyone else with a FA biographical article on en WP. But specific to your points, Phleps was awarded a high award posthumously, so who it was handed to (his son, a serving officer) is definitely relevant to his biography. We Australians would do the same for a VC recipient. The fact that you consider it not to be relevant says more about you than it does about the article. This article and its &quot;intricate detail&quot; was considered by the seven different reviewers when it went through GA, Milhist ACR and FA {{ping|MisterBee1966|Ian Rose|Zawed|Anotherclown|Dank}} {{ping|Sturmvogel 66|Abraham, B.S.}}, and they didn't raise any issues about it. In fact one reviewer asked if there were any more personal details available... Which brings me back to my central thesis with your approach. I've said it before, but I'm afraid it is you who has a strange idea of what constitutes &quot;intricate detail&quot;. You have your own rather &quot;unique&quot; way of looking at things, and will not drop the stick regardless of the advice you receive about the death of the horse. That is tendentious behaviour, much like your widespread deletion of material from articles on the basis of removing &quot;intricate detail&quot;. I believe this article met the Featured criteria when it was promoted, and believe it continues to do so, whether you personally agree or not. In fact, given your general editing approach, your view on the matter is of no interest to me. As I explained to your colleague above, I have some experience with editors who carp on talk pages and don't edit in article space, and I have little regard for that behaviour. I don't propose to engage with you (beyond a simple acknowledgement) if you don't work in article space. Hopefully we are all here to build an encyclopaedia. In your case, I have well-founded doubts. But you could yet prove me wrong. If we have disagreements in article space, I will obviously use community fora such as RfCs to resolve them.

== Forcibly retired from the army ==

The article claims that Phleps was transferred to the reserves in 1940 and &quot;forcibly retired from the service in 1941&quot;, after he had criticized King Carol. That's according to Hans Bergel's piece in the ÖBL. Bergel writes, however, &quot;wegen Kritik an Bukarester Verhältnissen wurde er 1940 i. d. Res. versetzt und 1941 auf eigenes Ansuchen aus rumän. Diensten entlassen.&quot; The latter means, that he requested to be dismissed from the Romanian service. If there's no further concern I would clear that up.--[[User:Assayer|Assayer]] ([[User talk:Assayer|talk]]) 20:32, 11 November 2016 (UTC)
