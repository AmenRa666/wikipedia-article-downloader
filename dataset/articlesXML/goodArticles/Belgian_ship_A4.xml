'''Patrol vessel ''A4''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Patrouilleur A4}}) was a small {{sclass2-|Mersey|naval trawler}} operated by Belgium during the [[Second World War]]. Originally built for the British [[Royal Navy]], as HMS ''John Ebbs'', the ship is notable for its role in evacuating Belgian gold reserves to England during the [[Battle of Belgium]] in May 1940. The success of the operation not only allowed the [[Belgian government in exile]] to fund its operations but deprived the German occupiers of an important asset to support their war effort. After the Belgian surrender, the vessel and its crew [[Internment|interned]] themselves in [[Francoist Spain|neutral Spain]]. In 1946, the vessel and its crew were released and the ship was scrapped soon afterwards.

==Background==
''Pilote 4'' (later renamed ''Patrouilleur A4'') was purchased by the Belgian [[Belgian Navy|''Corps de Marine'']] in 1920, having previously served in the British [[Royal Navy]] during the [[First World War]] as HMS ''John Ebbs'' (FY3566).&lt;ref name=Pottinger1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pottinger |first=James |title=HMS John Ebbs |url=http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cacunithistories/hms_john_ebbs.htm |accessdate=20 August 2013 |magazine=Shetland Life Magazine |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel was a Mersey-class naval trawler, built by [[Cochrane Shipbuilders|Cochranes]] in [[Selby]], North Yorkshire, and was launched on 2 October 1917.&lt;ref name=Pottinger1/&gt; [[Displacement (ship)|Displacing]] {{convert|334|lt|t}}, the vessel was {{convert|148|ft|m}} long, and had a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|4.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=MB1/&gt; Fitted with engines that were capable of producing {{convert|600|hp}}, it could travel at between 9 and 10 knots.&lt;ref name=MB1/&gt; With a complement of 27, the Belgians armed the ship with two [[Maxim gun|Maxim machine guns]] on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and a [[47 mm Model 1931 anti-tank gun|47mm gun]] at the [[stern]].&lt;ref name=Pottinger1/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB1/&gt; In 1939, ''A4'' was waiting to be scrapped, but the deteriorating international situation caused by German expansionism led to its reactivation by the [[Ministry of Defence (Belgium)|Ministry of National Defence]].&lt;ref name=MB1&gt;{{cite web |title=A4 ex HMS John Ebbs |url=http://www.marinebelge.be/pages2/a4.html |website=Marine Belge |language=French |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Belgium's neutral status in the early stages of the Second World War, ''A4'' had large [[Flag of Belgium|Belgian tricolours]] painted on each side of its hull, as well as the word &quot;&lt;small&gt;BELGIË&lt;/small&gt;&quot; ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for &quot;Belgium&quot;) in white, to prevent it being mistaken for a belligerent ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Photo n° 33893 |url=http://pallas.cegesoma.be/pls/opac/plsp.getplsdoc?lan=F&amp;htdoc=general/opac.htm |website=[[Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society|CEGESOMA]] |language=French |accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Belgium was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940, it was not repainted.

==Evacuation of Belgian gold==
During the interwar period, Belgium had created a [[gold standard|gold-based]] currency, called the Belga, which ran parallel to the [[Belgian franc]]. The Belga was intended for international trading and meant that the [[National Bank of Belgium]] amassed considerable gold reserves, amounting to some 600 tonnes by 1940.&lt;ref name=NBB2/&gt;

During the escalating international tensions in the 1930s, the Belgian government began moving large amounts of gold to the United States, Great Britain and Canada, but was forced to retain some gold in the country to maintain the Belga's value.&lt;ref name=NBB2&gt;{{cite web|last=Bultinck|first=Leen|title=Belgian gold in foreign hands|url=http://www.nbbmuseum.be/2010/03/belgische-goud.htm|publisher=National Bank of Belgium Museum|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the Germans [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]] in May 1940, there were still 40 tonnes of gold left in Belgium, held at the bank's offices in the port of [[Ostend]].&lt;ref name=VdW42&gt;{{cite book |last1=Verbreyt |first1=Monique |first2=Herman |last2=Van der Wee |title=A Small Nation in the Turmoil of the Second World War: Money, Finance and Occupation, 1939–1945 |year=2009 |publisher=Leuven University Press |location=Leuven |isbn=9058677591 |page=42 |edition=Rev. and trans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only ship available in the area was ''A4'', commanded by Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh.&lt;ref name=VdW42/&gt; On 19 May 1940, the vessel was loaded with the gold and, avoiding [[Dunkirk]] which was being bombed by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', headed for the British coast, accompanied by the ship ''[[Belgian ship P16|P16]]'' which was carrying refugees.&lt;ref name=Pottinger1/&gt; After being transferred from port to port because of concerns for the safety of the cargo during unloading, the gold was landed at [[Plymouth]] on 26 May, two days before the Belgian surrender.&lt;ref name=VdW42/&gt; The gold was finally deposited at the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref name=VdW42/&gt; ''A4'' also carried [[Hubert Ansiaux]], the civil servant charged with overseeing the evacuation of the gold to England and the future Governor of the National Bank.&lt;ref name=NBB2/&gt;

The fact that so much Belgian gold had been rescued before the German occupation allowed the [[Belgian government in exile]] to finance its own operations, unlike most other exiled governments which had to rely on British financial support.&lt;ref name=Buyst&gt;{{cite web |last=Erik |first=Buyst |title=Camille Gutt and Postwar International Finance |url=http://eh.net/book_reviews/camille-gutt-and-postwar-international-finance |type=Book review |website=EH.net |publisher=[[Economic History Association]] |date=November 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbb.be/pub/02_00_00_00_00/02_02_00_00_00/02_02_04_00_00/02_02_04_02_00.htm?l=en |title=A Brief History of Belgian Banknotes and Coins {{ndash}} 1914–1944: Wars and Monetary Upheavals |website=[[National Bank of Belgium]] |accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Since Belgium had officially surrendered on 28 May and no official Belgian government yet existed in England, the crew of ''A4'' took their ship to [[Port of Bilbao|Bilbao]] in neutral Spain to avoid having to return to Belgium and become German prisoners of war.&lt;ref name=Pottinger1/&gt; They arrived in Spain on 26 June and spent the rest of the war interned.&lt;ref name=MB1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nos marins et l'Espagne |url=http://www.marinebelge.be/pages2/espagne.html |website=Marine Belge |language=French |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control of the ship was returned to Belgium in 1946 and it was scrapped in 1948.&lt;ref name=Pottinger1/&gt;

For his role in the evacuation of the gold, Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh was awarded the [[Order of Leopold II]].&lt;ref name=MB1/&gt;
