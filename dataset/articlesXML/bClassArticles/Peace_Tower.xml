The '''Peace Tower''' (in [[French language|French]]: ''Tour de Paix''), also known as the '''Tower of Victory and Peace''' (in French: ''tour de Victoire et de Paix''),&lt;ref name=Books&gt;{{cite web| url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/ic/can_digital_collections/books/history.htm| title=The Books of Remembrance &gt; History of the Books| author=Library and Archives Canada| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a focal [[Bell tower|bell]] and [[clock tower]] sitting on the central axis of the [[Centre Block]] of the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Parliament Hill|parliament buildings]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. The present incarnation replaced the {{convert|55|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Victoria Tower (Canada)|Victoria Tower]] after the latter [[Centre_Block#Great_fire|burned down in 1916]], along with most of the Centre Block; only the [[Library of Parliament]] survived. It serves as a [[National symbols of Canada|Canadian icon]]&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/publications/Memorial/Memorial-e.asp| title=Parliament of Canada &gt; The Memorial Chamber| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been featured prominently on the [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill]] directly adjacent the queen's visage, until the change to polymer.

==Characteristics==
Designed by [[Jean Omer Marchand]] and [[John A. Pearson]], the tower is a ''[[campanile]]'' whose height reaches 92.2 m (302&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in),&lt;ref name=Parl&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ottawakiosk.com/parliament/p_2.html| title=Ottawa &gt; Arts &amp; Entertainment &gt; Attractions &gt; Parliament Hill Tour| author=Ottawakiosk.com| publisher=Ottawa Kiosk| accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; over which are arranged a multitude of [[rock carving|stone carvings]], including approximately 370 [[gargoyle]]s, [[grotesque]]s, and [[frieze]]s, keeping with the [[Gothic Revival architecture in Canada#Victorian High Gothic|Victorian High Gothic style]] of the rest of the parliamentary complex. The walls are of [[Nepean, Ontario|Nepean]] sandstone and the roof is of reinforced concrete covered with [[copper]].&lt;ref name=Treasure&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collineduparlement-parliamenthill.gc.ca/batir-building/centre/tour-tower/tour-tower-eng.html |author=Public Works and Government Services Canada |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |title=Peace Tower |deadurl=no |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:South-east grotesque on Peace Tower.jpg|thumb|left|One of four [[grotesque]]s at the corners of the Peace Tower]]

At its base is a [[porte-cochere]] within four [[Arch|equilateral pointed arches]], the north of which frames the main entrance of the Centre Block, and the jambs of the south adorned by the [[supporters]] of the [[Arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]]. Near the apex, just below the steeply pitched roof, are the tower's 4.8&amp;nbsp;m (16&amp;nbsp;ft) diameter clock faces,&lt;ref name=Treasure /&gt; one on each of the four facades. The mechanical workings of the timepiece were manufactured by the [[Verdin Company]] and are set by the [[National Research Council Time Signal]]. One level below, running around the circumference of the tower's shaft, is an [[observation deck]].&lt;ref name=Parl/&gt; This was the highest accessible space in Ottawa until the early 1970s; the Peace Tower dominated the [[List of tallest buildings in Ottawa-Gatineau|Ottawa skyline]], as a strict 45.7&amp;nbsp;m (150&amp;nbsp;ft) height limit was placed on other buildings. That limit, however, was later rescinded, leading the Peace Tower to lose its distinction as the city's tallest structure. Cantilevered out at each of the four corners of the tower, at the level of the observation platform, are four 2.5 m (8&amp;nbsp;ft 4 in) long, 75&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in) high, and 45&amp;nbsp;cm (1&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in) thick gargoyles made of [[Stanstead, Quebec (township)|Stanstead]] grey [[granite]] from Beebe, Quebec.&lt;ref name=Treasure/&gt;
[[File:Peace Tower Clock (1).jpg|thumb|South clock face and the glass windows of the observation deck below]]

The tower's flagpole holds symbolic significance, acting as the flagpole of the nation. As such, strict protocol surrounds the display of banners atop the Peace Tower, such as [[Half-staff#Canada|half-masting]] for national mourning and showing the [[Royal standards of Canada#Sovereign|flag of the sovereign]], that of any [[Monarchy of Canada#Royal family and house|member of the Royal Family]], or the [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada|flag of the governor general]], when any of those persons are present on Parliament Hill.

In 1981, a new inclined elevator was installed. It travels on a 10Â° angle for the first {{convert|98|ft}}, shifting its position horizontally {{convert|12|ft|2.25|in|sigfig=4}}, and straight up for the  {{convert|60|ft|9|in}} remainder of the climb. The elevator car stays level at all times during its movement because it has a gimbal-mounted double frame. Before the installation of the new elevator, the observatory had been reached by taking first one elevator, then climbing a flight of stairs to a second elevator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/01/realestate/ottawa-elevator-changes-course.html| title=Ottawa Elevator Changes Course| newspaper=New York Times| date=February 1, 1981| accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial Chamber===
The Peace Tower was designed by architect [[John A. Pearson]] not only to stand as an architectural feature and landmark, but also to function as a [[memorial]] to Canadians who had given their lives during the Great War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8336| last=Department of National Defence| title=Memorial Chamber| work=National Inventory of Military Memorials| date=March 16, 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus houses the Memorial Chamber, a vaulted 7.3 m by 7.3 m (24&amp;nbsp;ft by 24&amp;nbsp;ft) room directly above the porte-cochere,&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; with [[stained glass]] windows and various other features illustrating Canada's war record, such as the brass plates made from spent shell casings found on battlefields that were inlaid into the floor, and bore the name of each of Canada's major conflicts during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Stone that architect John Pearson personally collected from the main European battlefields where Canadians were killed is included in the floors and walls. Pearson described the room, also called the Memorial Chapel, as a &quot;sacred grove in the middle of the forest.&quot;&lt;ref name=cbc2015/&gt; 

The stone walls were originally to have been inscribed with the names of all Canada's servicemen and women who had died during the First World War; but, without enough space for all 66,000 names,&lt;ref name=Books/&gt; it was later decided to place [[Books of Remembrance (Canada)|Books of Remembrance]] there instead;&lt;ref name=Parl /&gt; the books list all Canadian soldiers, airmen, and seamen who died in service of [[the Crown]]âwhether [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|that of Britain]] (before 1931) or [[Monarchy of Canada|that of Canada]] (after 1931)âor allied countries in foreign wars, including the [[Nile Expedition]] and [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], the First World War, the [[World War II|Second World War]], and the [[Korean War]]. The books are displayed in glass cases on seven altars around the chamber, the pages of each book turned at 11 a.m. daily so every name is on display to visitors at least once during each calendar year.&lt;ref name=cbc2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tasker|first1=John Paul|last2=Morrissey|first2=Marie|title=Remembrance Day: Parliament Hill's Centre Block stands as a memorial to fallen soldiers|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/remembrance-day-parliament-hill-memorial-soldiers-1.3313076|accessdate=November 12, 2015|publisher=CBC News|date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sculpture====
Various elements within the room were formed with stone quarried from the battlefields of [[Europe]]: from the United Kingdom came Hoptonwood limestone; from Belgium, black marble for the wall plinths and altar steps, as well as St. Anne marble for the clustered columns that support the [[fan vault]] ceiling from each corner of the room; and from France, [[ChÃ¢teau-Gaillard]] stone for the walls and the vault itself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/memorial-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as stone from [[Flanders]]' fields. These materials were worked into 700 carved elements by a number of different artists and sculptors under the direction of [[Ira Lake]], who desired to tell not only the complete story of Canada's participation in the First World War, but also to commemorate military units as far back as the 17th century regime of [[New France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/stone-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Architectural Sculpture| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Memorial chamber section.jpg|thumb|left|John Pearson's drawings for the new [[Centre Block]] of [[Parliament Hill]], showing a section through the Memorial Chamber with elevation of the north wall and the staircase that rises behind it]]

Around the entrance archway are the ''The Sword of Victory''âa [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]] above the openingâand two stone lions by Pearson, the modeller Charles Adamson, and the sculptor ClÃ©ophas Soucy, each bearing a shield; the shield to the left bears the ''Dragon of Destruction'' and the date ''1914'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8317| last=Department of National Defence| title=The Dove of Peace, 1914| work=National Inventory of Military Memorials| date=March 16, 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while that on the right shows the ''Dove of Peace'' perched on a crown and the date ''1918''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/stone/42352-xl-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Architectural Sculpture &gt; Thumbnail index &gt; The Dragon of Destruction, 1914| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/stone/42351-xl-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Architectural Sculpture &gt; Thumbnail index &gt; The Dove of Peace, 1918| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of the [[antechamber]]'s arch is the sculpted work by Pearson and Soucy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8320| last=Department of National Defence| title=The Tunnellersâ Friends| work=National Inventory of Military Memorials| date=March 16, 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Tunnellers' Friends'', which shows representations of animals that served during the war: reindeer, pack mules, carrier pigeons, horses, dogs, canaries, and mice, all above the  inscription ''THE TUNNELLERSâ FRIENDS, THE HUMBLE BEASTS THAT SERVED AND DIED''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/stone/3369-xl-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Architectural Sculpture &gt; Thumbnail index &gt; The Tunnellers' Friends| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the [[archivolt]] at the other end of the entrance passage are sculpted animals and insects, such as beetles, spiders, lizards, butterflies, rats, hares, bats, birds, frogs, and bees; John Pearson stated that these were to represent the flora and fauna of Canada. The inscription around this arch is an excerpt from [[John Ceredigion Jones]]' poem ''The Returning Man'': ''ALL'S WELL FOR OVER THERE AMONG HIS PEERS A HAPPY WARRIOR SLEEPS''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/stone/33621-xl-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Architectural Sculpture &gt; Thumbnail index &gt; Archivolt| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The walls of the Memorial Chamber are divided into 17 [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] designed by Ira Lake and A. Fortescue Duguid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8321| last=Department of National Defence| title=Memorial Niche| work=National Inventory of Military Memorials| date=March 16, 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each contain a marble slab under a gothic [[blind arch]] topped with a [[Glossary of architecture#G|gablet]] and [[finial]], and decorated with various badges and insignia, including those of, on the [[molding (decorative)|moulding]]s: Canada's 178 pre-1914 militia regiments; in the pierced [[quatrefoil]] panels: cavalry, and non-infantry field units; in the [[Diaper (architecture)|diaper]] background: pre-Confederation French and British regiments and colonial forces; on the gablet [[crocket]]s: reinforced battalions; on the gablet [[Springer (architecture)|springers]]: all branches of the Canadian Corps;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/stone/74701_1-xl-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Architectural Sculpture &gt; Thumbnail index &gt; Niche (no. 1)| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the arch quatrefoil and cusps: Badges and insignia of Canada's 178 pre-1914 militia regiments: The Royal Canadian Dragoons, Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), The Governor General's Body Guard, 1st Hussars, 2nd Dragoons, 3rd The Prince of Wales' Canadian Dragoons; on the arch [[spandrel]]s: medals and war decorations of the allied countries; on the shield: coats of arms appropriate to the relevant historical context; and on the low relief panel: historical scenes of Canadians during World War I. The marble panels themselves originally described the various campaigns and battles in the theatres of war between 1914 and 1918. These, however, were replaced in 1982 with panels illustrating the Canadian Forces' engagements from the [[Fenian Raids]] to the [[Korean War]], along with excerpts from the Bible, poems, and other literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/stone/74701_2-xl-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Architectural Sculpture &gt; Thumbnail index &gt; Niche (no. 1)| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Windows====
After John Pearson canvassed British artists in stained glass for designs for the Memorial Chamber's windows, he settled on  Frank S.J. Hollister of Toronto for the task; Hollister's proposal was presented in 1925 to the [[Public Works and Government Services Canada|Department of Public Works]] for the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]]'s approval. Each of the three 7 m by 3.5 m windows is divided into vertical quadrants by stone mullions and contain [[Allegory|allegorical]] figures amongst heraldic symbols, including the Royal Arms of Canada, the arms of each of the provinces, and those of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/windows-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Stained Glass Windows| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''The Call to Arms''
This window displays four allegories: ''Victory'', as a woman holding a crown and surrounded by a [[Laurel wreath|laurel]] branch and a helmet on a shield; ''Labour'', a male figure amongst objects such as a shovel, spinning wheel, and [[astrolabe]], with the motto ''Fortitudo Industria et Pax'' (Strength Industry and Peace); ''Progress'', a man holding a book and quill, surrounded by a celestial crown, [[weighing scale]]s, [[hourglass]], and [[galley]]; and ''Science'', a male holding a microscope and flask, amongst symbols such as a globe and torch, all below a ribbon indicating metallurgy, mineralogy, and chemistry. These four figures are arranged above four lower panels, the first showing three inscriptions: ''THANKS BE TO GOD WHO GIVETH US THE VICTORY'', from 1 Corinthians 15:57,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|1 Cor|15:57|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''FAITH UNTO DEATH'', and ''ACQUIT YE LIKE MEN BE STRONG'', both from 1 Corinthians 16:13.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|1 Cor|16:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in this section is a crowd of people bearing shields and spears, who represent the people of Canada uniting in response to the call of the man shown in the second panel, who holds a sword and trumpet, calling &quot;To Arms&quot;; at his side is a child holding flowers, representing faith and courage. This section also displays the words ''THOU HAST GIRDED ME WITH STRENGTH UNTO THE BATTLE'', from Psalm 18:39.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Psalm|18:39|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third panel stands a woman supporting a rod entwined with winged serpents, the [[Rod of Asclepius]], characterising the nurses of battle, and below her is the phrase ''TRUE WORTH THAT NEVER KNOWS IGNOBLE DEFEAT SHINES WITH UNDIMMED GLORY'', taken from [[Odes (Horace)|Horace's Odes]]. The fourth bay displays a group of men and horses congregating from farms, offices, and factories, while a fleet of ships rests at bay awaiting the men to carry them to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/glass/7330-xl-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Stained Glass Windows &gt; Thumbnail index &gt; The Call to Arms| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Memorial Chamber Windows.jpg|thumb|Looking up the south face of the Peace Tower, showing one of the Memorial Chamber's windows, ''The Dawn of Peace'']]

; ''The Assembly of Remembrance''
This is the south window, the first panel of which shows the [[Michael (archangel)|archangel Michael]] holding a trumpet, representing the call to battle, and, above his head, a seated woman with children at her knee, symbolising the sacrifices of women and children in the name of liberty, honour, and justice, while in the lower portion an armoured figure bears the Crown of Victory in his hands. The second panel contains the inscriptions: ''AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING WE WILL REMEMBER THEM'', taken from the work of [[Laurence Binyon]], and ''FREEDOM IS THE SURE POSSESSION OF THOSE ALONE WHO HAVE COURAGE TO DEFEND IT'', from [[Pericles]], as well as, in the lower portion, an armoured figure holding a [[Torch|flambeau]], and, in the upper part, [[Saint George and the Dragon|St. George slaying the dragon]]. The third panel contains ''[[Lady Justice]]'' bearing the Scales of Justice and the Great Sword of Judgement, the sword-guard of which shows a figure in a [[crucifixion]] poseârepresenting suffering for both the victors and the defeatedâand below her the words ''JUSTITIA LIBERTAS PERPETUO'' (Justice Liberty in Perpetuity). Beneath Lady Justice in this panel is the heroic figure of Canada wearing armour and helmet and holding the laurel wreath of victory, but looking mournfully at the Book of Remembrance, and behind her are two other persons, one symbolising Canadian motherhood and the other [[First Nations]]. The fourth quadrant shows [[Joan of Arc]] bearing a shield and standing before the [[National Emblem of France|royal coat of arms of France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/glass/7331-xl-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Stained Glass Windows &gt; Thumbnail index &gt; The Assembly of Remembrance| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''The Dawn of Peace''
Similar to the other windows, this one shows four figures across the top portion. The first of these is the figure of the ''Victory of Peace'', holding both a palm branch and the sword of judgement, while a dove flies overhead. The second person shown is that of ''Prosperity'', who holds a wheat sheaf and a sicle, and, next to him, is ''Progress'', bearing a winged wheel and with the Lamp of Knowledge above his head. The fourth figure is ''Plenty'', symbolising the replenishment of both material and spirit through noble pursuit. Arranged in the lower portion of the window is a crowd of people assembled in peace and led by three figures in the foreground and bearing the symbols of their trades: ''Industry'' holds a [[mallet]] and [[dynamo]], ''Agriculture'' bears a [[scythe]], ''Honour'' carries a torch inscribed with words from [[John McCrae]]'s poem ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'': ''BE THE TORCH YOURS TO HOLD IT HIGH'', and ''Motherhood'', who is surrounded by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8314| last=Department of National Defence| title=The Dawn of Peace| work=National Inventory of Military Memorials| date=March 16, 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the base of the second and third panels are the phrases: ''HE MAKETH WARS TO CEASE'', from Psalm 46:9, and ''JUDGEMENT SHALL RETURN UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS'', from Psalm 94:15.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Psalm|94:15|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/glass/7332-xl-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Stained Glass Windows &gt; Thumbnail index &gt; The Dawn of Peace| author=Library of Parliament | publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying the Peace Tower clock is a 53-bell [[carillon]], conceived by an act of parliament as a commemoration of the [[Armistice with Germany (CompiÃ¨gne)|1918 armistice]] that ended World War I and was inaugurated on 1 July 1927, the 60th anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].&lt;ref name=Car&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//carillon/history-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt;  Carillon &gt; History| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest of the bells weighs {{convert|10|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}} and the [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]] weighs {{convert|10|LT|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}}, all cast and tuned by [[Gillett &amp; Johnston]] in [[Croydon]], [[England]],&lt;ref name=Parl/&gt; and which are used by the [[Dominion Carillonneur]] for both regular recitals and to toll to mark major occasions such as [[state funeral]]s and [[Remembrance Day#Canada|Remembrance Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//carillon-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Carillon| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each bell is stationary and is struck by its internal clapper, itself mechanically linked to the carillon keyboard, to create a note, a particular one on the music scale for each bell. In this way, the carillon plays similarly to a piano, allowing the carillonneur to change the sounds by varying the way he or she strikes the keys.&lt;ref name=Car/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Peace Tower Construction.jpg|thumb|left|The tower under construction in 1921]]
Coming immediately after the destruction of the parliament buildings by fire in 1916, the Peace Tower's conception coincided with the end of the [[World War I|First World War]]. With this in mind, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Borden]] dedicated the site of the tower on 1 July 1917, with the words: &quot;[the tower will be a] memorial to the debt of our forefathers and to the valour of those Canadians who, in the Great War, fought for the liberties of Canada, of the Empire, and of humanity.&quot; Two years later, the Peace Tower's foundation stone was laid by Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King [[Edward VIII]]), during his wider [[Royal tours of Canada|royal tour of Canada]], and the structure was [[Topping out|topped out]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=3171| last=Department of National Defence| title=Peace Tower memorial| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1925, an informal ceremony was held in the Memorial Chamber, wherein [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|the Viscount Byng of Vimy]]; Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]; Leader of [[Official Opposition (Canada)|His Majesty's Loyal Opposition]] [[Arthur Meighen]]; and the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces during World War I, [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|the Earl Haig]], laid the base stones of the clustered marble columns that support the fan vault ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Sites/Collections//heritage_spaces/memorial/stone/vault-xl-e.htm| title=The House of Commons Heritage Collection &gt; Heritage Spaces &gt; Memorial Chamber &gt; Architectural Sculpture &gt; Thumbnail index &gt; Fan vault| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince of Wales then returned to Ottawa again in 1927 to dedicate the [[altar]] of the Memorial Chamber and to inaugurate the Dominion Carillon,&lt;ref name=Books /&gt; the first playing of which on that day was heard by listeners across the country on the first ever coast-to-coast radio broadcast in Canada.&lt;ref name=Car/&gt;

Starting in 1994, the Peace Tower was covered and the accessible spaces closed for a two-year conservation project aimed at reversing deterioration of the masonry and preventing further moisture penetration.&lt;ref name=Treasure/&gt; However, the machinery of the clock was not within the scope of work and, on 24 May 2006, the clock stopped for the first time in 28 years, with the display inactive at 7:28 for about one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/05/24/peacetower.html|title=Time stands still on Parliament Hill CBC.ca|accessdate=25 May 2006 | work=CBC News | date=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
