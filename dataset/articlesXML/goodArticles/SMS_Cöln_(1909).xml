'''SMS ''Cöln''''' (&quot;His Majesty's Ship [[Cologne]]&quot;)&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;SMS&quot; stands for &quot;''[[Seiner Majestät Schiff]]''&quot; ({{lang-de|His Majesty's Ship}})&lt;/ref&gt; was a {{sclass-|Kolberg|cruiser|0}} [[light cruiser]] of the German ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy) during the [[First World War]]. She had three sister ships, {{SMS|Kolberg}}, {{SMS|Mainz||2}}, and {{SMS|Augsburg||2}}. She was built by the [[Germaniawerft]]; her hull was laid down in 1908 and she was launched in June 1909. ''Cöln'' was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] in June 1911. She was armed with a main battery of twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] and had a top speed of {{convert|25.5|kn|abbr=on}}. After her commissioning, she served with the [[II Scouting Group]], part of the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. 

''Cöln'' was assigned to patrols off the island of [[Heligoland]] at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914, as the [[flagship]] of Rear Admiral [[Leberecht Maass]]. At the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five [[battlecruiser]]s and several light cruisers. ''Cöln'' was initially stationed in support of the forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces, and encountered Vice Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty's]] [[battlecruiser]]s. She was hit several times by the battlecruisers' large-caliber guns, but managed to escape in the haze. She inadvertently turned back toward them, however, and was quickly disabled when the battle resumed. The crew abandoned ''Cöln'', but German vessels did not search the area for three days, and only one man survived.

==Design==
{{main|Kolberg class cruiser}}

''Cöln'' was {{convert|130.5|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.73|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|4915|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load.&lt;ref name=G106/&gt; ''Cöln'' was initially to be powered by two sets of [[Heinrich Zoelly|Zoelly]] [[steam turbine]]s manufactured by [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie.]] in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref name=HRS180/&gt; Her propulsion system was revised and instead consisted of two sets of Germaniawerft steam turbines driving four propellers. They were designed to give {{convert|19000|shp|lk=in}}. These were powered by fifteen coal-fired Marine [[water-tube boiler]]s. These gave the ship a top speed of {{convert|25.5|kn}}. ''Cöln'' carried {{convert|960|MT|abbr=on}} of coal that gave her a range of approximately {{convert|3500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|14|kn}}.&lt;ref name=G106&gt;Gröner, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cöln'' had a crew of eighteen officers and 349 enlisted men. The ship was armed with twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], eight were located amidships, four on either side, and two were side by side aft.&lt;ref name=C159&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; She also carried four [[5.2 cm SK L/55 naval gun|5.2&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/55]] anti-aircraft guns. She was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in the hull. She could also carry 100 [[naval mine|mines]]. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} thick armor plate.&lt;ref name=G106/&gt;

==Service history==
''Cöln'' was ordered under the contract name ''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Schwalbe||2}} and was laid down on 25 May 1908 at the [[Germaniawerft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]]. She was launched on 5 June 1909 and christened by the mayor of [[Cöln]], [[Max Wallraf]], after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. During the builders' [[sea trial]]s, the Zoelly turbines were found to be poor quality and they were replaced with Germaniawerft-produced models. This work significantly delayed her completion.&lt;ref name=HRS180&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr and Steinmetz, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 16 June 1911,&lt;ref name=G1067&gt;Gröner, pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; and she began her acceptance trials. These were interrupted by a fleet parade for [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] on 5 September. On 10 October,&lt;ref name=HRS180/&gt; she was assigned to the [[II Scouting Group]], which screened for the [[battlecruiser]]s of the [[I Scouting Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in the normal peacetime routine of individual, squadron, and fleet exercises and cruises over the next two years without incident.&lt;ref name=HRS180/&gt; ''[[Fregattenkapitän]]'' [[Hans Zenker]] served as her commander from October 1911 to September 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr and Steinmetz, pp. 179&amp;ndash;181&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
From 28 August to 21 September, she served as the [[flagship]] for ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (Rear Admiral) [[Franz von Hipper]], then the deputy commander of the reconnaissance forces, while Hipper was temporarily displaced from his usual flagship, the battlecruiser {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}. Hipper left briefly, but returned on 26 September and remained aboard through the following year. During the autumn fleet maneuvers in September 1913, ''Cöln'' attempted to warn the crew of [[zeppelin]] [[LZ 14|''L 1'']] of the deteriorating weather conditions, but they did not receive the message. As a result, the zeppelin [[Helgoland Island air disaster|crashed off the island of Helgoland]]. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, Hipper lowered his flag, and he was replaced by ''[[Kommodore]]'' (Commodore) [[Leberecht Maass]].&lt;ref name=HRS180/&gt; The year 1914 began with the normal training routine, but as tensions rose following the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] on 28 June forced the cancellation of the planned fleet exercises for the end of July. Starting on 30 July, as war loomed, ''Cöln'' was stationed in the [[German Bight]] to monitor maritime traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr and Steinmetz, pp. 180&amp;ndash;181&lt;/ref&gt;

After the outbreak of [[World War I]] at the beginning of August 1914, she and several other cruisers were tasked with patrol duties in the [[Heligoland Bight]].  The cruisers were divided with the torpedo boat flotillas, and assigned to rotate through nightly patrols into the North Sea.&lt;ref name=S43&gt;Scheer, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 to 7 August, ''Cöln'' lay in the [[Schillig]] [[roadstead]]. She thereafter went to the mouth of the [[Weser]], where she was joined by the cruiser {{SMS|Hamburg||2}} and the IV Torpedo-boat Flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr and Steinmetz, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the patrol operations, ''Cöln'' conducted a sortie on the night of 15 August with {{SMS|Stuttgart||2}} and the I and II Torpedo-boat Flotillas, without incident.&lt;ref name=S43/&gt;

===Battle of Heligoland Bight===
{{main|Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)}}
At the same time, British [[submarine]]s began reconnoitering the German patrol lines. On 23 August, several British commanders submitted a plan to attack the patrol line with the light cruisers and [[destroyer]]s of the [[Harwich Force]], commanded by Commodore [[Reginald Tyrwhitt]]. These ships would be supported by submarines and Vice Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty's]] [[battlecruiser]]s and associated light forces. The plan was approved and set for 28 August.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 30&amp;ndash;31&lt;/ref&gt; The British forces began to leave port on the evening of 26 August, beginning with the submarines assigned to the operation. Most of the surface forces went to sea early on the following morning; the 7th Cruiser Squadron, which had been added to provide further support to the Harwich Force, left port later in the day.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 28 August, ''Cöln'' was re-coaling in [[Wilhelmshaven]]. Her sister, {{SMS|Mainz||2}}, was at anchor in the mouth of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]], and {{SMS|Ariadne||2}} lay in the entrance to the [[Weser]]. These three cruisers were assigned to support the cruisers {{SMS|Stettin||2}} and {{SMS|Frauenlob||2}}, and the [[aviso]] {{SMS|Hela||2}}, which were stationed on the patrol line that morning.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. 4&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; At 07:57, the Harwich Force encountered the outer German torpedo boats, which fled back to the German cruisers on the patrol line. In the ensuing [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]], ''Stettin'' engaged the British force first, and was quickly reinforced by ''Frauenlob''.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. 6&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receiving reports of the action, Rear Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]], the commander of the reconnaissance forces, ordered Maass to deploy his cruisers to support the engaged vessels. At 09:30, ''Cöln'' steamed out of port.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Köln 012 034.jpg|thumb|Wrecked [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] from ''Cöln'' recovered after the battle]]
''Cöln'' steamed to aid her sister ''Mainz'', which was under heavy fire from several British cruisers and battlecruisers. At around 13:25, she came upon the damaged cruiser {{HMS|Arethusa|1913|6}} and several destroyers. ''Cöln'' engaged the British ships briefly, but was interrupted by the appearance of the British battlecruisers. At 13:37, ''Cöln'' made a [[Boxing the compass|16-point]] turn and returned fire at the battlecruisers; the British ships turned to port to steam closer to ''Cöln'', which in turn similarly altered course to escape. She was hit several times, however, including one hit that killed Maass. At 13:56, another German cruiser arrived on the scene, which distracted the British ships and allowed ''Cöln'' to slip away to the north. About fifteen minutes later, she turned back south-east to return to port.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. 19&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt;

The reversal of course brought her back in range of the British battlecruisers, however, which quickly opened fire and scored several damaging hits. The order to abandon ship was given, and men began gathering on the deck.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers set [[scuttling]] charges while the men topside prepared to go into the water. At 14:25, the ship rolled over and sank. The survivors expected the British to pick them up, but they instead departed. German ships searched the area three days later, to find only one survivor, Leading Stoker Neumann; the rest of the crew had died in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck was moved in August 1979 to render it less of an underwater hazard. Some parts of the ship were salvaged and are now preserved in the [[Cuxhaven Shipwreck Museum]].&lt;ref name=G107&gt;Gröner, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
