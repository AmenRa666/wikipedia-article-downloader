'''HMS ''Firedrake''''' was an [[E and F-class destroyer|F-class]] [[destroyer]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the early 1930s. Although assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] upon completion, the ship was attached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in 1935–36 during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Abyssinia Crisis]]. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–39, she spent much time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict.

Several weeks after the start of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939, ''Firedrake'' helped to sink a German [[submarine]] and took part in the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in early 1940. She was sent to [[Gibraltar]] in mid-1940 and formed part of [[Force H]] where she escorted many [[Malta convoys]] in the [[Mediterranean]] and helped to sink an Italian submarine. ''Firedrake'' participated in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] and screened the [[capital ship]]s of Force H as they [[Operation Grog|bombarded Genoa]] before she was damaged by an Italian bomb in mid-1941. After her repairs were completed the ship became a [[Battle of the Atlantic|convoy escort in the Atlantic]] at the beginning of 1942. ''Firedrake'' was torpedoed and sunk by a German [[U-boat]] in late 1942 with the loss of most of her crew.

==Description==
The F-class ships were repeats of the preceding [[E and F-class destroyer|E-class]]. They displaced {{convert|1405|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1940|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|329|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|3|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|6|in|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=l6/&gt; They were powered by two [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]], using steam provided by three [[Admiralty three-drum boiler]]s. The turbines developed a total of {{convert|36000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|35.5|kn|lk=in}}. ''Firedrake'' barely exceeded her designed speed during her [[sea trial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;March, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; She carried a maximum of {{convert|470|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|6350|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}. The ships' complement was 145 officers and [[Naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=l6&gt;Lenton, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships mounted four [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch (120&amp;nbsp;mm) Mark IX guns]] in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' in sequence from front to rear. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.5&amp;nbsp;inch Vickers Mark III]] [[machine gun]]. The F class was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; One [[depth charge]] rack and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime modifications===
By October 1940, ''Firedrake'' had her rear torpedo tube mount replaced by a [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] [[AA gun]]. While the ship was under repair in late 1941, 'Y' gun had was removed to allow a total of 70 depth charges to be stowed aboard. Several other changes also probably happened during this refit, notably two single [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{convert|20|mm|1|abbr=on}} Oerlikon]] light AA guns were installed abreast the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and a [[Type 286 radar|Type 286]] short-range surface search radar was fitted as was a [[HF/DF]] [[radio direction finder]] mounted on a pole [[mainmast]].&lt;ref name=l6/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 241, 243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Firedrake'', the sixth ship of her name in the Royal Navy,&lt;ref&gt;Colledge, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; was built by Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company, [[Wallsend]], although her hull was sub-contracted to [[Vickers Armstrongs]]. She was [[laid down]] at their [[Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne]] shipyard on 5 July, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 28 June 1934, the same day as her [[sister ship]], {{HMS|Fame|H78|2}}, and completed on 30 April 1935. The ship cost 243,966 [[Pound sterling|pounds]], excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament. ''Firedrake'' was initially assigned to the [[6th Destroyer Flotilla]] (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sisters, during the Abyssinian crisis, in September and remained there until December. ''Firedrake'' was refitted at [[Gibraltar]] from 14 December 1935 to 11 February 1936. She briefly returned home to give leave to the crew later that month, but she returned to the Mediterranean in March and remained there until July when she began a refit at [[Sheerness Dockyard]].&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 75–76, 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its completion on 30 September, the ship returned to the Mediterranean and began to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the [[Non-Intervention Committee]] until June 1937. On 23 April 1937, ''Firedrake'', together with the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood||2}}, escorted a British merchantman into [[Bilbao]] harbour despite the presence of the [[Spanish State|Nationalist]] cruiser {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Almirante Cervera||2}} that attempted to blockade the port. ''Firedrake'' returned to Gibraltar in September and resumed patrols in Spanish waters until November when she began another refit at Sheerness that lasted until 30 December. The ship spent another two months at Gibraltar between January and March 1938 and then patrolled the Spanish coastline in the Bay of Biscay a year later. The 6th DF was renumbered the [[8th Destroyer Flotilla]] in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II. ''Firedrake'' remained assigned to it until June 1940, escorting the larger ships of the fleet.&lt;ref name=e0&gt;English, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
In September 1939 ''Firedrake'' was assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] and based at [[Scapa Flow]]. In the first month of hostilities she was part of an anti-submarine hunting group centred on the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}}. On 14 September, the carrier was unsuccessfully attacked by the {{GS|U-39|1938|6}}. ''Firedrake'', in company with her sisters {{HMS|Faulknor|H62|2}} and {{HMS|Foxhound|H69|2}}, counter-attacked and sank ''U-39'' north-west of [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=e0/&gt; On 5 October, the ship rescued survivors from the small [[freighter (ship)|freighter]] {{SS|Glen Farg}}. In February 1940, she was one of the escorts for [[Convoy TC 3]] carrying troops from Canada to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 30, 35&lt;/ref&gt; ''Firedrake'' was slightly damaged going alongside the destroyer {{HMS|Icarus|D03|2}} at [[Invergordon]] on 28 March and was repaired between 2 and 26 April at [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=e0/&gt;

In the Norwegian Campaign, she supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landings on 12–13 May at [[Bjerkvik]] during the [[Battle of Narvik#Land battle|Battle of Narvik]]. The ship continued to provide fire support during the battle for the rest of the month. During the nights of 30 and 31 May, ''Firedrake'' helped to evacuate troops from [[Bodø]] to [[Harstad]] and [[Borkenes]] to await further evacuation. She was one of the ships that escorted the [[troop ship]]s [[Operation Alphabet|evacuating the troops]] from the Narvik area on 7 and 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;Haarr, pp. 266, 269, 300, 312&lt;/ref&gt; She was slightly damaged by splinters during an aerial attack on 23 May and again on 12 June when her port steering motor and 'A' gun were knocked out of action; her repairs were completed eight days later.&lt;ref name=e0/&gt;

''Firedrake'' was briefly assigned to the [[4th Destroyer Flotilla]] until she rejoined the 8th DF in mid-August as they escorted the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} and the new carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|2}} from the UK to Gibraltar, arriving on 29 August. The next day, ''Fury'' and Force H covered the passage of ''Valiant'' and ''Illustrious'' through the Western Mediterranean to rendezvous with the Mediterranean Fleet ([[Operation Hats]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October, she sank the {{ship|Italian submarine|Durbo}} east of Gibraltar together with the destroyer {{HMS|Wrestler|D35|2}} and two [[Saro London]] [[flying boat]]s of [[No. 202 Squadron RAF|202 Squadron RAF]]. A boarding party captured cipher and operational documents aboard the boat which led to the sinking of the {{ship|Italian submarine|Lafolè}} two days later. Between them, the two destroyers rescued 5 officers and 43 ratings.&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty Historical Section 2002, Vol. I, p. 70; Rohwer, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; ''Firedrake'' escorted the carriers {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}} and ''Ark Royal'' during [[Operation Coat|Operations Coat]] and [[Operation White|White]] in November as they flew off aircraft for Malta. The ship escorted Force F to Malta during [[Operation Collar (convoy)|Operation Collar]] later in the month and participated in the inconclusive [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] on 27 November, where she was part of the screen for the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} and the battleship {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, pp. 47, 49–50; Smith, pp. 70–75&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1941, ''Firedrake'' was one of the ships that intercepted a [[Vichy French]] convoy off [[Mellila]] and seized all four merchant ships of the convoy.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, she was involved in [[Operation Excess]]. On 31 January 1941, Force H departed Gibraltar to carry out [[Operation Picket]], an unsuccessful night torpedo attack by eight of ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s [[Fairey Swordfish]] on the [[Tirso Dam]] in [[Sardinia]]. The British ships returned to Gibraltar on 4 February and began preparing for [[Operation Grog]], a naval bombardment of [[Genoa]], that was successfully carried out five days later. The destroyer accidentally [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] in fog near Gibraltar on 1 March and received preliminary repairs there until 21 April. Final repairs were completed at [[Chatham Royal Dockyard]] on 19 June and she rejoined the 8th DF back at Gibraltar shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty Historical Section 2002, Vol. II, pp. 48–53; English, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Operation Substance#Battle of 23 July|Operation Substance]], ''Firedrake'' and ''Foxhound'' were each leading a column of the convoy, streaming their TSDS minesweeps, through the [[Sicilian Narrows]] on 23 July when an Italian {{convert|100|kg|lb|adj=on}} bomb near missed ''Firedrake'' and detonated off her port side. The shockwave blew in the plating over No. 1 [[boiler room (ship)|boiler room]] and disabled her so that she had to be towed back to Gibraltar by the destroyer {{HMS|Eridge|L68|2}}. Temporary repairs were made in Gibraltar and she was transferred to the [[Boston Navy Yard]] for repair on 23 September. ''Firedrake'' exchanged one 4.7-inch gun for additional depth charges while under repair to better suit her new role as a convoy escort.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 80; Smith, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

After escorting Convoy NA 2 to the UK in January 1942, the ship was assigned to [[Escort Group B7]] of the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]]. While escorting [[ON convoys|Convoy ON(S) 94]] in May, the escorts drove off {{GS|U-406||2}}. ''Firedrake'' received repairs in April on the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] and August in [[Belfast]]. She rescued survivors from the torpedoed merchantman {{MV|Olaf Fostenes}} on 26 September. Two months later, the ship was detached to reinforce the escort for [[Convoy ON 144]] on 18 November and helped to prevent any further losses to the convoy. On 16 December, while escorting [[Convoy ON 153]], ''Firedrake'' was torpedoed by {{GS|U-211||2}} at 19:11. She broke in two; the bow section sinking immediately at coordinates {{coord|50|50|N|25|15|W|display=title,inline}}, but the stern stayed afloat until 00:45. The [[corvette]] {{HMS|Sunflower|K41|2}} picked up 26 survivors, but the rest of her crew of 140 men were lost.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 80; Rohwer, pp. 140, 165, 212, 219&lt;/ref&gt;
