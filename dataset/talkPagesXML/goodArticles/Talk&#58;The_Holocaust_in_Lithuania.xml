{{Talk:Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania/GA2}}

== Name ==
Almost all articles in [[:Category:Holocaust by country]] follow similar naming guidelines. This is one of the exceptions, and should be moved to [[Holocaust in Lithuania]]. Comments? --&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 20:02, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

:Seems reasonable. May well make it easier to find. The simplest title may also avoid the political concerns debated at the top of this talkpage.[[User:Fainites|Fainites]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Fainites|barley]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Fainites|&lt;small&gt;scribs&lt;/small&gt;]] 21:57, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

::This title is more exact and logical - Holocaust did not happen on national basis, neither it did happen before Nazi-occupation. Maybe this naming practice should be applied to other articles also, to avoid confusion? &quot;The simplest&quot; is not always the best, and there is a redirect for easier finding.--[[User:Lokyz|Lokyz]] ([[User talk:Lokyz|talk]]) 05:59, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
:::My views are; a) there should be consistency of naming between all the articles dealing with this topic, b) the titles should be worded in a way that avoids making any assumptions either way about matters which may be the subject of controversy within the article. On that latter point, speaking as a non-expert, I had understood &quot;Holocaust&quot; covered the process of genocide of Jews as planned/organised/carried out by the Nazis by a variety of means. This would include recruiting/encouraging people of other nationalities to join in, including creating a climate which gave murderous anti-semites or just criminals free rein. If there is a controversy about the extent to which various groups from various countries took part, this should be dealt with in the body of the article and/or a separate article. Hence the preference for a simple title that makes no assumptions one way or the other.[[User:Fainites|Fainites]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Fainites|barley]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Fainites|&lt;small&gt;scribs&lt;/small&gt;]] 09:36, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: I believe the reason for the title as is, is to counter the false contention that Lithuanians (and Latvians and Estonians) took to gleefully slaughtering their Jewish neighbors before the Nazis arrived. Even as is, the article presents too much the notion that the Nazis just pointed and the Lithuanians took up all the planning and execution.
:::: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rather, no Legion could be formed by the Nazis even if against the Red Army, small but effective German killing squads were sent out to annihilate Jews and then blame the Lithuanians--there's documentation for all of this: correspondence from non-military Germans observers writing back to Berlin about &quot;how bad it would look&quot; if it were discovered the Germans were roaming the Lithuanian countryside killing Jews--&lt;u&gt;in direct contradiction to military reports&lt;/u&gt; towing the propaganda line constructed in Berlin before the invasion, that of Lithuanians--and all Eastern Europe--joyfully taking up the cause of the Holocaust. Unfortunately, most authors as soon as they find &quot;neighbor killed neighbor&quot; accounts denounce [fill-in-your-Eastern-European-ethnicity]. Exactly why is there a veritable industry that Eastern Europeans hated Jews for centuries and became barbarians bludgeoning their Jewish neighbors to death at the very &quot;first opportunity&quot; the Nazis presented? Because we indulge those who all too easily accept the Western Europeans are civilized and Eastern Europeans are animals given the chance. It starts with Nazi propaganda, usurped by the Soviets, and accepted by far too many without question.
:::: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The notion that the archives of possibly the two most propagandist regimes in all of recorded human history &quot;don't lie&quot; and can be accepted at face value is preposterous. Exactly why are so many, including serious scholars, so eager to accept the most heinous of evidence at face value and ignore existing contradicting evidence?
:::: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I find myself agreeing with Lokyz that perhaps the more appropriate solution, albeit not the simplest, is &quot;Holocaust in Nazi-occupied X&quot; so that we are never ambiguous about who brought the Holocaust to X and who was responsible for the execution of the Holocaust in X.
:::: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The notion that many  or the majority of ethnicity X were involved in (or welcomed) the Holocaust in Eastern Europe both smears ethnicity X and minimizes the crimes against humanity of the (far fewer) collaborators of ethnicity X by effectively contending that they were no different from any other X, they were just caught.

::::: I can see your point, but I'd like again to point out to the naming conventions above, and the fact that 99% of the related articles and categories follow the simpler naming convention. I don't see why Lithuania - or the Baltics in general - should deserve special treatment. Please note I've also proposed the move of [[Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Poland]] to [[Holocaust in Poland]] as well. --&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 17:03, 21 February 2009 (UTC)
:::::::I see what it is you want to avoid but I don't think the title&quot; Holocaust in Lithuania&quot; implies what you fear it may imply. It would never have occured to me for example for the reasons I explained above. My first concern would be consistency between all the articles. Secondly the title needs to be as simple and obvious as it can be without being inaccurate or raising false implications. I don't think &quot;H in L&quot; does raise a false implication as you fear.

::::::::::Stop building [[straw men]], please. There is no controversy regarding Holocaust in Lithuania, save a sad tendency by some to push a version of Holocaust Denial and trying to minimize the very fact that yes, Holocaust occurred in Lithuania, and local populace was involved. The very fact that Lithuanian article is an exception in the series of &quot;Holocaust in a country&quot; articles is sending a very interesting message here.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 18:37, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

(od) Where [[Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Poland]] is concerned that too suffers from insufficient Nazi accountability--weasel phrases like &quot;German-inspired massacres&quot; implying no Nazi involvement, et al. IMHO, that's why the &quot;reminder&quot; is required in the title. We might consider &quot;The Nazi Holocaust in X&quot;, using &quot;Nazi Holocaust&quot; is quite common in titles on the subject. [[User:Vecrumba|PetersV]] &lt;SMALL&gt;&lt;SMALL&gt;&lt;FONT STYLE=&quot;background-color:#a12830;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT STYLE=&quot;background-color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT STYLE=&quot;background-color:#a12830;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SMALL&gt; [[User talk:Vecrumba|TALK]]&lt;/SMALL&gt; 02:39, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
:Doesn't ''The Holocaust'' as a proper noun refer to the Nazi one by common usage? I haven't looked but no doubt this has already been debated endlessly on various pages before. We need a consistent formula and '''one''' place to debate it. The choices seem to be &quot;Holocaust in X&quot;, Holocaust in Nazi-occupied X&quot;, &quot;Nazi Holocaust in X&quot;.[[User:Fainites|Fainites]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Fainites|barley]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Fainites|&lt;small&gt;scribs&lt;/small&gt;]] 13:31, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
::Good point. Indeed, rarely, the Holocaust is used in another context. But in this cases it is usually indeed specified in more detail. Thus &quot;clarifying&quot; the title of &quot;Holocaust in Lithuania&quot; makes it actually more confusing - and suspicious. --&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 17:32, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

I am also in favor for the current tittle. &quot;Arguments&quot; for the &quot;simplest&quot;, &quot;shortest&quot;, or &quot;more popular&quot;, usually obscure in such situations. Good example [[German camps in occupied Poland during World War II]], title is one of the most clumsiest ever, even have no established usage in google hits (compare [http://books.google.com/books?q=%22German+camps+in+occupied+Poland+during+World+War+II%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books German camps in occupied Poland during World War II] 4 hits of same source, [http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Polish+concentration+camps%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books Polish concentration camps] 325 hits, [http://books.google.com/books?q=%22concentration+camps++in+poland%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books concentration camps  in poland] 617 hits.) [[User:M.K|M.K.]] ([[User talk:M.K|talk]]) 13:18, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

As the GA reviewer on this article I will weigh in on the debate.  I am fairly impartial on this subject having just reviewed the article.  To me, two of the above arguments hold the most weight, one being consistency - I am a big proponent of being consistent across all articles on a given subject.  The second is regarding the term &quot;the Holocaust&quot;, which is a proper noun and is used to describe the Nazi Holocaust of WW2.  I don't think there is any ambiguity in removing &quot;Nazi-occupied&quot; as the term &quot;Holocaust&quot; automatically infers Nazi involvement and Nazi responsibility.  I don't feel that it automatically puts a stigma on the nationality described (in this case Lithuania).  As long as the body of the article correctly reflects the history of the time then the reader is left to judge.  The title of the article will not sway the reader one way or the other.  Make all the articles on the topic named the same, this enhances Wikipedia's credibility and organization.  Those are my two cents.  [[User:H1nkles|H1nkles]] ([[User talk:H1nkles|talk]]) 17:10, 23 February 2009 (UTC)
:I've moved the article, per arguments above and comments of neutral GA reviewer. Please note that the current name (HiL) is the original name the article was created under. It was moved to HiNoL without discussion.

::'''There is no controversy regarding Holocaust in Lithuania, save a sad tendency by some to push a version of Holocaust Denial.'''

:::For benefit of other editors I'll make an exception to the [[WP:DFTT]] policy and answer your question. Few  years ago, respected Lithuanian scholar [[Arūnas Bubnys]] [http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/swiat/1,34175,151474.html noted] that there are [[Vilnija|certain organizations]] in Lithuania who try to spread false claims, creating straw man and bogymen (for example by slandering the name of [[Armia Krajowa]]) while having appalling underlying political motives, chiefly among to whitewash and divert attention from [[Collaboration during World War II#Lithuania|German–Lithuanian collaboration]] and crimes committed by units such as the [[Lithuanian Secret Police]]. As for which editors share this POV and try to promote it on Wikipedia, I think it has been clear for ''years'' now. EOT for me on this. --&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 19:37, 23 February 2009 (UTC)
::::I'm sorry, but I have to beg to disagree. Nazi propaganda regarding the Holocaust in Eastern Europe and the extent of collaboration by the local populace is still alive and well. Both Lithuanians are victims as well as Poles (aforementioned Polish death camp &quot;controversy&quot;). People are making their livings on the tenet that all Eastern Europe were vile Jew-haters for centuries, it only took Hitler to unleash them.
:::: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I've read that the local populace of X supported the deaths of Jews because &quot;that's the only way Hitler could have been so 'successful'&quot;. There's a wide gap between reputable scholarship and sensationalist taking &quot;authentic&quot; Nazi reports at face value (that would be the aforementioned &quot;slander&quot;). &lt;u&gt;'''&quot;Archives&quot; does not mean &quot;authentic&quot;--especially when those VERY SAME ARCHIVES contain documents that give the lie to military reports, &quot;news&quot; accounts sent out through Nazi collaborators in Sweden, etc.'''&lt;/u&gt; It's too bad my hands are full with family matters, an article on Hitler's creation and engineering of the myth of the &quot;Germanless&quot; Holocaust as part of his invasion of Eastern Europe, Soviet exploitation of that myth, and how that myth is rooted and being reinforced today is long overdue. [[User:Vecrumba|PetersV]] &lt;SMALL&gt;&lt;SMALL&gt;&lt;FONT STYLE=&quot;background-color:#a12830;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT STYLE=&quot;background-color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT STYLE=&quot;background-color:#a12830;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SMALL&gt; [[User talk:Vecrumba|TALK]]&lt;/SMALL&gt; 19:05, 25 February 2009 (UTC)
:::::The Polish death camps controversy is not a result of Nazi propaganda. It was not Nazi propaganda that tried to portray EE as a haven for antisemites. The best explanations I've run accross is that such an image was created by Jewish historiography, which assumed that the death of local Jewish populations had to be a responsibility of local (non-Jewish) populations which could have but didn't stop the Holocaust. In any case, I certainly think that we should have an article on the [[myth of the Germanless Holocaust]] (or whatever is the appropriate term). But that has little to do with the title here. Holocaust in [country name] does not suggest it was was a Holocaust perpetrated by the populace of that country; it simply notes it occurred there. Singling out Lithuania, Poland, the Baltics or so on simply confuses things. Either all of the articles in the series use the &quot;Nazi-occupied&quot; string, or none at all. --&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 19:31, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

:::Comment. Piotrus, it's a bit late to be ordering anyone who wishes to restore the old name to &quot;please use [[WP:RM]]&quot;. Article has been at HiNoL for nearly a year, from a few days after it was created. The stable version is hence HiNoL, so if your move is reverted it will be you who needs to hold a [[WP:RM]].

::::Less wikilawyering, please. The article was created under proper naming conventions as part of the series &quot;Holocaust in country&quot;, it was moved without discussion to a new title. Indeed, I gave the editor who moved it more time then I should before I moved it back, but the current name is the consensus name throughout the entire series of &quot;Holocaust in country&quot;.

::::: There's [[WP:Page movement|no written law for WP:RM]], just custom. It is not the custom to treat names that haven't been the location of pages for nearly a year, and even then only for a day or so, as stable.

:Incidentally, as all other such omit the &quot;Nazi-occupied&quot; part it does not seem feasible to make Lithuania an exception. I agree with Piotrus that there's no choice at this stage but to 1) leave this article without &quot;Nazi-occupied&quot; or 2) move most other such articles. It should be noted though that not all such articles could be moved; e.g. the currently non-existing [[Holocaust in Romania]], where it was the free Romanian government rather than German government that planned and carried out genocide against Jews.

:::P.S Ah, I've forgot the ripoff of Klaipėda by Nazis in 1939. Is th holocaust in memelland also p-art of this article? Or not?--[[User:Lokyz|Lokyz]] ([[User talk:Lokyz|talk]]) 20:54, 7 March 2009 (UTC)
:::: There is Lokyz's complete valid point that we not count the Holocaust twice/thrice/etc. &quot;Nazi-occupied&quot; is significant ONLY for Lithuania as there is the question of &lt;u&gt;'''exactly which Lithuania are we talking about'''&lt;/u&gt;. An enormous number of Holocaust victims came from inter-bellum Poland.

::::: The place to clarify such things is in the article, not the title. Per [[Wikipedia:NC#Be_precise_when_necessary]]: should there be a disambiguation at &quot;Holocaust in Lithuania&quot;? The answer is &quot;no&quot;. It's as simple as that.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 06:00, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

==Jewish partisans in modern Lithuania==
I removed the following unreferenced block of text which doesn't seem that relevant anyway.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 06:18, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

The Lithuanian President [[Valdas Adamkus]] convoked a special panel of international experts to investigate what were termed &quot;the crimes of the Nazi and Soviet occupational regimes in Lithuania,&quot; a move that initially drew criticism because the title of the commission again equated the Holocaust with an alleged genocide against Lithuanians committed by the Soviets. Initial criticism evaporated when respected figures in Holocaust Studies such as [[Sir Martin Gilbert]] and [[Yitzhak Arad]], former head of [[Yad Vashem]], agreed to work with the Lithuanian presidential commission. In 2007 Lithuanian prosecutors began investigations of war crimes allegedly committed by Jewish anti-Nazi partisans in Lithuania and asked Israeli authorities to question Yitzhak Arad. Arad promptly withdrew from the Lithuanian presidential commission and told the Israeli press he would not return to the Baltic country. Since then, Lithuanian prosecutors have expanded their investigation to include other anti-Nazi Jewish partisans who survived the Lithuanian Holocaust through armed struggle. The investigation has drawn international criticism and global media attention. Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio 4 documentary &quot;Lithuania: The Battle for Memory&quot; by Tim Whewell on 22 July 2008, Efraim Zuroff noted Lithuania's total lack of will to prosecute Nazi collaborators but enthusiasm in accusing Holocaust survivors of crimes against Lithuanian civilians.

:I do not think removing this information is inappropriate. It would be tantamount to including information or quotes in an article on WP such as [[Jews in Poland|The History of anti-Semitism in Poland]]:
::&quot;[[Poles]] suck [[anti-Semitism]] with their mothers' milk. This is something that is deeply imbued in their tradition, their mentality. Like their loathing of Russia. The two things are not connected, of course. But that, too, is something very deep, like their hatred of Am Yisrael. Today, though, there are elements in [[Poland]] that are cleansed of this anti-Semitism.&quot; Quote by: [[Yitzhak Shamir]] former [[Prime Minister of Israel]].

:::As always, your motivational comments inspire me to hard work on this project. Do you think that I should select YB for my next project? Or perhaps the Ponary massacre? --&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 06:31, 26 February 2009 (UTC) 

::::Try [[Zydokomuna]] first, (I believe that article was your own special creation). Then find someone else to  inspire you to remove the [[WP:weasel]]ness from the [[Pinsk massacre]] article. If you do a good job I'll try to give you some further inspiration so that you can do the same with the [[Kielce pogrom]] article.  Please note that I did not include the [[Jedwabne massacre]], since that took place under Nazi-occupation, whereas the other two events did not. Of course the victims in the events that preceeded the Holocaust and subsequent to it were not any deader than any others who had been murdered as a result of anti-Semitism during the Holocaust.

::::: I've been doing some digging and there are some reputable contentions that Gross ignored evidence that non-Poles were involved in Jedwabne. But a story for a different talk page.

(od) But back to the original, I'm disappointed that the more I read of Efraim Zuroff over the years, the more I have come to believe he is interested in the politics (viewing in simple black and white) and less in a comprehensive investigation and accounting of the events of WWII.

== Arithmetical Discrepancy  ==

The article at time of my writing this contains the following two passages:

&gt; Prior to the German invasion, the population of Jews was estimated to be about 210,000,[2] although according to data from the Lithuanian statistics department, as of 1 January 1941 there were 208,000 Jews.[3] &lt;

&gt; About 80,000 Jews were killed by October and about 175,000 by the end of the year.[1] The majority of Jews in Lithuania were not required to live in ghettos[c] nor sent to the Nazi concentration camps which by then were just in the preliminary stages of operation. Instead they were shot in pits near their places of residence with the most infamous mass murders taking place in the Ninth Fort near Kaunas and the Ponary Forest near Vilnius.[5][10][11] By 1942 about 45,000 Jews survived, largely those who had been sent to ghettos and camps &lt;

175,000 + 45,000 = 220,000, which is 10,000 more than 210,000 and 12,000 more than 208,000.  

Can anyone resolve this?  Thanks [[User:Hardicanute|Hardicanute]] ([[User talk:Hardicanute|talk]]) 14:19, 10 May 2011 (UTC)Hardicanute

== MAP ==
this map is supposed to show predominantly the concentration camps in the Baltic region, yet Siauliai Concentration Camp is not on it! I can also not imagine that there was NO concentration camp in Estonia (or death camp)!!!
When reading the description of the map, the status of the map is given as in the year 1942, BUT not which month, which possibly explains why the &quot;Farthest Advance of German Armies&quot; is so far in the west!!! Although there are no towns located on the sowjet part of the map, I cannot imagine that the &quot;Farthest Advance of German Armies&quot; is really the farthest advance!
