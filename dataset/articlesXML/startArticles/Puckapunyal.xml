'''Puckapunyal''' (more formally the '''Puckapunyal Military Area''', but also known as the '''Puckapunyal Camp''' or '''Puckapunyal Army Base''', and colloquially as &quot;'''Pucka'''&quot;) is an [[Australian Army]] training facility and base 10&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Seymour, Victoria|Seymour]], in central [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], south-eastern [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=OxCom435&gt;Dennis et al. (eds.), ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Puckapunyal is a small restricted-access town inhabited mainly by about 280 families of the Australian Defence Force community, with an associated area of about 400&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of [[bushland]] and former [[pasture]] used for [[field training exercise]]s. It is home to the Australian Army's School Of Armour and the [[School of Artillery (Australia)|School of Artillery]], the School of Transport, and the School of Ordnance, along with the Combined Arms Training and Development Centre, the Joint Logistics Unit, and two transport squadrons.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al. (eds.), ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', pp. 435–6&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Army Tank Museum]] is on the base's grounds,&lt;ref name=OxCom436/&gt; and the facilities are used by the Victorian [[Australian Army Cadets]] Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defence.gov.au/minister/14tpl.cfm?CurrentId=2945&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the military education and training venues, most accommodation consists of single-storey brick houses with backyards. It contains a [[primary school]], shops, a variety of sporting facilities, and a theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dha.gov.au/contact/infopuckapunyal.html|title=Information about Puckapunyal |accessdate=2011-09-24 |work= |first= |last= |publisher=Defence Housing Australia |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Puckapunyal Matilda Tank DSC01931.JPG|thumb|right|250px|alt=Matilda II tank|A [[Matilda II]] tank at the Puckapunyal Tank Museum]]
The area was first used as a mobilisation and training area during World War I.&lt;ref name=OxCom435/&gt; During the early 1920s, an ordnance store and rifle range were built on the site.&lt;ref name=OxCom435/&gt; In 1939, the area was formally established as Puckapunyal Camp: the name was taken from the Aboriginal name for a large hill within the training area, which has been variously translated as &quot;death to the eagle&quot;, &quot;the outer barbarians&quot;, &quot;the middle hill&quot;, &quot;place of exile&quot;, and &quot;valley of the winds&quot;.&lt;ref name=AWMpucka&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/place_557.asp |title=Puckapunyal |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base was used to train the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]], as other Army establishments were at capacity training [[Australian Militia|Militia]] units.&lt;ref name=AWMpucka/&gt; The original site was too small for wartime training, and an additional {{convert|5700|ha}} were acquired.&lt;ref name=OxCom435/&gt; As well as Australian units, the United States Army's [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st Infantry Division]] trained at Puckapunyal.&lt;ref name=OxCom435/&gt;

In 1949, the [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|1st Armoured Regiment]] was raised at Puckapunyal.&lt;ref name=AWM1armour&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_13757vietnam.asp |title=Unit Information—1st Armoured Regiment, Vietnam |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regiment remained based at Puckapunyal until it relocated to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in June 1995.&lt;ref name=OxCom435/&gt;

During the 1950s, Puckapunyal was host to the [[3rd National Service Training Brigade]] (see [[National Service Act 1951]]).&lt;ref name=OxCom435/&gt;  During the [[Vietnam War]], national servicemen conscripted under the [[National Service Act 1964]] outside of Queensland and New South Wales were sent to Puckapunyal (soldiers from these states trained at [[Army Recruit Training Centre|Kapooka]] or [[Lone Pine Barracks|Singleton]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ham, ''Vietnam'', p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; They were trained by the [[2nd Recruit Training Battalion (Australia)|2nd Recruit Training Battalion]], with up to 4,000 soldiers at Puckapunyal at any given time.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In the 1980s, the Army undertook a land rehabilitation program, as decades of heavy use had caused major [[land degradation]].&lt;ref name=OxCom436&gt;Dennis et al. (eds.), ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1988, subsequent land acquisitions had increased the training area to {{convert|39290|ha}}.&lt;ref name=OxCom435/&gt;

The National Service barracks were transferred to the Third Training Group in the 1980s to provide recruit and promotion training for General Reserve soldiers and also promotion training for Reserve Officers attending the Reserve Command and Staff College.  This continued until the closure of the Training Group in June 2000.

During 1999 and 2000, some 1000 citizens from [[Kosovo]] were housed in the Training Group barracks as part of a temporary protection program in support of the NATO activity in the province.  They returned to Kosovo once the situation there had stabilized. {{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Environment==
[[File:Bush Stone-curlew pair.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Pair of bush stone-curlews|Puckapunyal is a stronghold of [[bush stone-curlew]]s in Victoria.]]
The Puckapunyal Military Area (PMA) experiences cool to cold winters, when most of the average annual rainfall of 596&amp;nbsp;mm occurs, and dry, warm to hot, summers.  The site is characterised by a series of rocky hills and ridges trending north to south, with the highest parts around Mount Puckapunyal (413&amp;nbsp;m) and Mount Kappe (384&amp;nbsp;m). The soils are mainly [[Duplex soil|duplex]], having low natural fertility and water holding capacity, with smaller areas of deep [[alluvium]]. Surface drainage is oriented towards the north and north east, with [[surface runoff]] flowing into the [[Goulburn River (Victoria)|Goulburn River]].  All streams in the PMA are seasonal.&lt;ref name=bli&gt;BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Puckapunyal. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora and fauna===
The PMA contains [[box-ironbark forest]] that forms one of the largest discrete remnants of this threatened [[ecosystem]] in Victoria.  Some 706 species of [[vascular plant|vascular]], and 170 of non-vascular, plant have been recorded.  Two species, [[Glycine latrobeana|clover glycine]] and [[dodonaea procumbens|trailing hop-bush]], are nationally threatened.  Records have been made of 44 [[mammal]]s, 18 [[reptile]]s, 12 [[frog]]s, 11 [[fish]] and over 140 [[invertebrate]]s.&lt;ref name=bli/&gt;

====Birds====
[[File:Lathamus discolor Bruny 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Swift parrot perched in eucalypt foliage|Puckapunyal's box-ironbark forest is an important site for swift parrots]]
The entire PMA, along with two small [[nature reserve|reserves]] and an army [[Ammunition dump|munitions storage site]] at nearby [[Mangalore, Victoria|Mangalore]], has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as a 435&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) because it supports the largest known population of [[bush stone-curlew]]s in Victoria. It is also regularly visited by [[endangered]] [[swift parrot]]s, often in large numbers. [[Diamond firetail]]s are common residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Puckapunyal |accessdate=2011-09-23 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other significant birds recorded from the site (out of a total of 207 species) are [[regent honeyeater|regent]] and [[painted honeyeater]]s, [[flame robin|flame]] and [[pink robin]]s, [[Australasian bittern|Australasian]] and [[black-backed bittern]]s, [[powerful owl|powerful]] and [[barking owl]]s, and [[white-throated nightjar|white-throated]] and [[spotted nightjar]]s.&lt;ref name=bli/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Puckapunyal is mentioned in [[I Was Only Nineteen]], the #1 single by [[Redgum]] from the 1983 album ''[[Caught in the Act (Redgum album)|Caught in the Act]]''. It is also mentioned in episode 84 of Prisoner (aka Prisoner Cell Block H)
