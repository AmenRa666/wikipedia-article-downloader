==Untitled==
I will attempt the translation and correct the other issues as soon as I can, including references and citations also this article does have a worldwide view in respect of the effect it had on the perceived invincibility of the Spanish navy.[[User:Jkslouth|Jkslouth]] ([[User talk:Jkslouth|talk]]) 01:05, 4 May 2010 (UTC)jkslouth

::Translation completed [[User:Jkslouth|Jkslouth]] ([[User talk:Jkslouth|talk]]) 13:05, 8 May 2010 (UTC)jkslouth

==Proposed paragraph deletion==
Paragraph under Azores with italics and square brackets I propose to delet as it is not in the original Spanish article and I have no way of adding references or citations as I am not the author [[User:Jkslouth|Jkslouth]] ([[User talk:Jkslouth|talk]]) 15:49, 7 May 2010 (UTC)jkslouth

::This paragraph now deleted [[User:Jkslouth|Jkslouth]] ([[User talk:Jkslouth|talk]]) 13:05, 8 May 2010 (UTC)jkslouth

==Worldwide View==
I think to a military or naval historian, this is an important article. Authors attempting the translation seem not to have worked on the article for sometime. It describes one of the first incidences in the battle for supremacy of the Atlantic which raged between the Spanish, French, British(English)and Dutch for a couple of centuries. I think the original Spanish article is clearly and consisely written, well sourced and demonstrates a balanced and impartial reporting of an important event, and I have attepted to reflect that in the English translation. I notice it has been placed in two important military categories and I will explore further categories. [[User:Jkslouth|Jkslouth]] ([[User talk:Jkslouth|talk]]) 15:59, 7 May 2010 (UTC)jkslouth

==References==
I will start to give citations and further internal links today, but this will take some time. Please be patient.[[User:Jkslouth|Jkslouth]] ([[User talk:Jkslouth|talk]]) 15:59, 7 May 2010 (UTC)jkslouth

Not sure I agree with the change in capitalisation. ''[[User:Rich Farmbrough|Rich]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Rich Farmbrough|Farmbrough]]'', 22:22, 9 May 2010 (UTC).
:: Having checked current style trends, I think I agree with you. I'm so used to book title I forget article headings are different. As you and I seem to be the only editors at the moment shall we just change it back? [[User:Jkslouth|Jkslouth]] ([[User talk:Jkslouth|talk]]) 09:20, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
:I'm not sure this is the best name for this article at all. Is it really the [[WP:COMMONNAME]]? Wouldn't something like [[Battle of Cadiz (1587)]] (which currently redirects here) be more encyclopaedic? [[User:Robofish|Robofish]] ([[User talk:Robofish|talk]]) 19:54, 29 April 2011 (UTC)
::I agree. Not being a English history major, it seems almost strange that the title of this subject has been given a colloquial naming convention. I am quite sure that looking up historical books, references, etc. would determine, as much as this fanciful title may be associated with this event, the true title is likely something along the lines of &quot;Drakes expedition (1587)&quot;. Once again, I am not a history-phile, but this seems like a POV-type name change. Further, where is the discussion on such a controversial change?

Editors desiring to contest the closing decision should consider a [[Wikipedia:move review|move review]]. No further edits should be made to this section. ''

The result of the move request was: '''no consensus''', hence not moved.  Several commenters below seem to disfavor the current title simply because it seems unconventional.  While this argument is not necessarily invalid, it can easily be overcome if sources are adduced attesting to the common usage of the title, as [[User:victor falk]] has done.  Any future move request regarding this article should -- in order to have a reasonable probability of success -- focus more strictly on the question of which name is used in reliable sources for the battle.

[[:Singeing the King of Spain's Beard]] → {{no redirect|?}} – Per the comments two years ago, two sections above, and to match the bolded text in the lead and infobox (not to mention the other wikis' articles), this article should be moved to [[Drake's 1587 expedition]]. Something like [[Battle of Cadiz (1587)]], [[English attack on Cadiz (1587)]] or [[English raid on Cadiz (1587)]] (a rough non-speaker translation of the Polish wiki's title) would be good, too. &lt;small&gt;''Relisted''. [[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 16:42, 21 May 2014 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; [[Special:Contributions/206.117.89.4|206.117.89.4]] ([[User talk:206.117.89.4|talk]]) 04:57, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:I did a little digging, and found that [[User:Þjóðólfr]] did the initial move (from [[Drake's 1587 expedition]]) - that editor had a (rather short) history of edit-warring and such on British Isles articles. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive598#Requesting_input_for_proposed_community_sanction_of_User:Mister_Flash_regarding_edits_related_to_the_British_Isles this AN/I thread] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Aatomic1/Archive this SPI report] for more gritty details.

:So, shouldn't this be a technical move back to the previous title? [[User:Xyl 54|Xyl 54]] ([[User talk:Xyl 54|talk]]) 14:57, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::Dunno. Either way, IPs can't move pages, and considering it's on the main page it shouldn't be done until tomorrow UTC. [[Special:Contributions/206.117.89.5|206.117.89.5]] ([[User talk:206.117.89.5|talk]]) 19:20, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::I concur. This is an incredibly odd name for the article, and I don't recall ever hearing it referred to as such in history class. That's purely anecdotal, but I think unless there is overwhelming evidence of common name, that the expedition title is more descriptive and encyclopedic.[[Special:Contributions/12.11.127.253|12.11.127.253]] ([[User talk:12.11.127.253|talk]]) 19:43, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' (albeit with some reluctance, as the phrase is wonderfully poetic).  But it is not clear to me that Drake's usage, and perhaps the usage of others, relates solely to this incident, or to a general strategy of harassing Spain.  Perhaps someone more versed in the history of this era can help.  [[User:Kablammo|Kablammo]] ([[User talk:Kablammo|talk]]) 14:30, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Close discussion, wrong forum''' [[WP:NOTCLEANUP]]. If the factual correctness of any content of an article is disputed, including in its title, the proper procedure is to tag {{tl|accuracy}}, {{tl|disputed}}, {{tl|unreferenced}}, or somesuch template.  But an utterly cursory gbook search shows it is indeed named so.

Also, this is a [[proper name]].

::This talk page is the appropriate place to discuss a move to a new (or former) name, per [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]].   As to the substance:  Clearly the phrase was used (and a main fault of the article is its failure to explain the circumstances of its use by Drake).  But the question here is the proper title of an article about Drake's 1587 raid on Spanish shipping at Cadiz.  [[User:Kablammo|Kablammo]] ([[User talk:Kablammo|talk]]) 23:16, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

Feel free to cut the bluster and prove me wrong: Find an reference work that calls this battle by the current title of the article. &quot;The Harper Encyclopedia of Military History&quot; and &quot;Brassey's Encyclopedia of Land Forces and Warfare&quot; are the go to sources for this kind of information, although neither one is online. [[User:Uniform cunieform|Uniform cunieform]] ([[User talk:Uniform cunieform|talk]]) 04:16, 2 May 2014 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

*'''Oppose''' This may seem a tad unencylopedic but is still the name by which the action is commonly known, or at least it was when I was a kid.  [[Garrett Mattingly]]'s work on the Armada has a chapter title &quot;A Beard is Singed&quot; suggesting that most of his readers would understand this allusion anyway.  Proposed alternative titles would probably leave a lot of readers momentarily wondering if this is the action referred to.  You also have the problem that with no clear alternative proposed there might be a majority to move, but no consensus what to move to, so the current title could still have a plurality. [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 01:57, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:*&lt;s&gt;I don't think it's appropriate to be assessing the consensus at the same time that you're voting. The closer assesses the consensus when the voting is complete. The RM is where editors give reasons to support or oppose the proposal based on the merits. Don't prejudge the result while people are still voting. [[User:Uniform cunieform|Uniform cunieform]] ([[User talk:Uniform cunieform|talk]]) 04:32, 2 May 2014 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
::*I wasn't trying to prejudge the consensus, I was simply making the general point that I have sometimes seen it happen on Wikipedia that you might get a majority against the existing title, but no clear consensus about what to move it to, which is why I tend to dislike these &quot;move to ?&quot; requests. [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 15:11, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*To be fair, originally I had [[Drake's 1587 expedition]] as the suggested target, but removed it before I saved the request for some stupid reason. [[Special:Contributions/206.117.89.4|206.117.89.4]] ([[User talk:206.117.89.4|talk]]) 03:19, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. If I still had my High School history text I could give that as a reference I guess... not the best source but better than none. It clearly says that Drake used the phrase, and in my experience the current title conforms well to WP:AT. The article overall is well above average, and the title perfect, IMO. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 09:57, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

The last section, [[Singeing_the_King_of_Spain%27s_Beard#Explanation_of_Drake.27s_phrase|Explanation of Drake's phrase]], gives a 1571 Ottoman usage as the origin of the phrase.  This seems far afield from the actual subject of the article, but more importantly, we do not know if that was in fact the origin or if it was in more common usage.  And the meaning given in that section looks to me like interpretation-- in other words, original research.  I propose therefore to delete this section.

Other than in the title to this section, the article does not otherwise mention Drake's actual use of the phrase for this purpose (raids on the Spanish).  According to some accounts, he used it in the presence of his sovereign, who gave her approval for the expedition.  If someone has access to reliable sources on this, that usage should be added.

:The problem is that it that it is not introduced in the [[wp:lede]], but relegated to a section at the end of the article. This should be {{tl|sofixit}}ed. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Victor_falk|''walk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[user:victor falk|''victor falk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[user_talk:victor falk|''talk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:45, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
