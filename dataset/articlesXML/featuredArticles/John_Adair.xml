'''John Adair''' (January 9, 1757 – May 19, 1840) was an American pioneer, soldier, and politician.  He was the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|eighth]] [[Governor of Kentucky]] and represented the state in both the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]].  A native of [[South Carolina]], Adair enlisted in the state militia and served in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], during which he was twice captured and held as a prisoner of war by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]].  Following the War, he was elected as a delegate to South Carolina's convention to ratify the [[United States Constitution]].

After moving to Kentucky in 1786, Adair participated in the [[Northwest Indian War]], including a skirmish with the  [[Miami people|Miami]] Chief [[Little Turtle]] near [[Fort St. Clair]] in 1792. Popular for his service in two wars, he entered politics in 1792 as a delegate to Kentucky's constitutional convention.  Adair was elected to a total of eight terms in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]] between 1793 and 1803.  He served as Speaker of the Kentucky House in 1802 and 1803, and was a delegate to the state's [[Kentucky Constitution#The 1799 Constitution|Second Constitutional Convention]] in 1799.  He ascended to the United States Senate to fill the seat vacated when [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]] resigned to become [[Attorney General of the United States]] in the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] of [[Thomas Jefferson]], but failed to win a full term in the subsequent election due to his implication in a [[Burr conspiracy|treason conspiracy]] involving Vice President [[Aaron Burr]].  After a long legal battle, he was acquitted of any wrongdoing; and his accuser, General [[James Wilkinson]], was ordered to issue an apology.  The negative publicity kept him out of politics for more than a decade.

Adair's participation in the [[War of 1812]], and a subsequent protracted defense of Kentucky's soldiers against General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s charges that they showed cowardice at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], restored his reputation.  He returned to the State House in 1817, and [[Isaac Shelby]], his commanding officer in the War who was serving a second term as governor, appointed him [[adjutant general]] of the state militia.  In 1820, Adair was elected eighth governor on a platform of financial relief for Kentuckians hit hard by the [[Panic of 1819]], and the ensuing economic recession.  His primary effort toward this end was the creation of the [[Bank of the Commonwealth (Kentucky)|Bank of the Commonwealth]], but many of his other financial reforms were deemed unconstitutional by the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]], touching off the [[Old Court–New Court controversy]]. Following his term as governor, Adair served one undistinguished term in the United States House of Representatives and did not run for re-election.

==Early life==
John Adair was born January 9, 1757, in [[Chester County, South Carolina]], a son of [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants Baron William and Mary [Moore] Adair.&lt;ref name=harrison1&gt;Harrison in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith168&gt;Smith, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at schools in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], and enlisted in the South Carolina colonial militia at the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name=congbio&gt;&quot;Adair, John&quot;. ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress''&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to the regiment of his friend, Edward Lacey, under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Thomas Sumter]] and participated in the failed [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Colonial]] assault on a [[Loyalist]] outpost at the [[Battle of Rocky Mount]] and the subsequent Colonial victory at the [[Battle of Hanging Rock]].&lt;ref name=fredricksen2&gt;Fredricksen, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scoggins150&gt;Scoggins, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; During the British victory over the Colonists at the August 16, 1780, [[Battle of Camden]], Adair was taken as a [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref name=hall1&gt;Hall, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  He contracted [[smallpox]] and was treated harshly by his captors during his months-long imprisonment.&lt;ref name=hall1 /&gt;  Although he escaped at one point, Adair was unable to reach safety because of difficulties related to his smallpox infection and was recaptured by British Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]] after just three days.&lt;ref name=fredricksen2 /&gt;  Subsequently, he was released via a [[prisoner exchange]].&lt;ref name=fredricksen2 /&gt;  In 1781, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the South Carolina militia, and fought in the drawn [[Battle of Eutaw Springs]], the war's last major battle in the Carolinas.&lt;ref name=fredricksen2 /&gt;  Edward Lacey was elected [[sheriff]] of Chester County after the war, and Adair replaced him in his former capacity as the county's [[justice of the peace]].&lt;ref name=scoggins150 /&gt;  He was chosen as a delegate to the South Carolina convention to ratify the [[U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;

In 1784, Adair married Katherine Palmer.&lt;ref name=bussey26&gt;Bussey, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; They had twelve children, ten of them daughters.&lt;ref name=bussey26 /&gt; One married [[Thomas Bell Monroe]], who later served as Adair's [[Secretary of State of Kentucky|Secretary of State]] and was appointed to a federal judgeship.&lt;ref name=morton13&gt;Morton, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1786, the Adairs migrated westward to [[Kentucky]], settling in [[Mercer County, Kentucky|Mercer County]].&lt;ref name=dab&gt;&quot;John Adair&quot;. ''Dictionary of American Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service in the Northwest Indian War==
Enlisting for service as a [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] in the [[Northwest Indian War]] in 1791,&lt;ref name=dab /&gt; Adair was soon promoted to major and assigned to the brigade of [[James Wilkinson]].&lt;ref name=smith168 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fredricksen2 /&gt;  On November 6, 1792, a band of [[Miami people|Miamis]] under the command of [[Little Turtle]] encountered Adair and about 100 men serving under him on a scouting mission near [[Fort St. Clair]] in [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name=fredricksen2 /&gt; When the Miami attacked, Adair ordered Lieutenant (and later governor of Kentucky) [[George Madison]] to attack their right flank while Adair led 25 men to attack the left flank.&lt;ref name=collins165 /&gt; (Adair had intended for a subordinate to lead the charge, but the officer was killed before Adair could give the order.)&lt;ref name=collins165 /&gt;  The maneuver forced the Miamis to fall back and allowed Adair's men to escape.&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;  They retreated to their camp and made a stand, forcing the Miamis to withdraw.&lt;ref name=collins165 /&gt;  Six of Adair's men were killed; another four were missing and five were wounded.&lt;ref name=collins165 /&gt;  Among the wounded were Madison and [[Richard Taylor (colonel)|Richard Taylor]], father of future U.S. President [[Zachary Taylor]].&lt;ref name=collins165&gt;Collins, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing his bravery and fighting skill, Adair's superiors promoted him to [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;  He was assigned to the command of [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]], who would eventually serve as Kentucky's fourth governor.&lt;ref name=smith168 /&gt;  He assisted in the construction of [[Greenville, Ohio|Fort Greeneville]] in 1794, forwarding supplies to [[Anthony Wayne]] during his operations which ended in a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]].&lt;ref name=fredricksen2 /&gt;

==Early political career==
[[File:JGarrard.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A man with long, gray, thinning hair wearing a white button-up shirt and a black jacket. He is facing left.|Governor James Garrard named Adair registrar of the state land office in 1804.]]
Popular for his military service, Adair was chosen as a delegate to the Kentucky constitutional convention in 1792.&lt;ref name=harrison2&gt;Harrison in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the state's admission to the Union, he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, serving from 1793 to 1795.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;  He remained active in the Kentucky militia, and on February 25, 1797, he was promoted to [[brigadier general]] and given command of the 2nd Brigade of the Kentucky Militia.&lt;ref name=kyng&gt;Trowbridge, &quot;Kentucky's Military Governors&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  He was promoted to [[major general]] and given command of the 2nd Division of the Kentucky Militia on December 16, 1799.&lt;ref name=kyng /&gt;

Adair returned to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1798.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;  When Kentuckians voted to hold another constitutional convention in 1799 to correct weaknesses in their first constitution, Adair was chosen as a delegate.&lt;ref name=harrison2 /&gt;  At the convention, he was the leader of a group of politically ambitious delegates who opposed most limits on the powers and terms of office of elected officials, particularly on legislators.&lt;ref name=nhok77&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected to the Kentucky House again from 1800 to 1803.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;  A candidate for a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1800, he was defeated in an overwhelming 68–13 vote of the legislature by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], who had been the acknowledged leader of the just-concluded constitutional convention.&lt;ref name=jbjr110&gt;Harrison in ''John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1802, Adair succeeded Breckinridge as [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] by a vote of 30–14 over Elder David Purviance, the candidate preferred by Governor [[James Garrard]].&lt;ref name=everman69&gt;Everman, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to serve as Speaker for the duration of his tenure in the House.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;  In 1802, the legislature formed [[Adair County, Kentucky]], naming it after the popular Speaker.&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;

In January 1804, Garrard nominated Adair to the position of registrar of the state land office.&lt;ref name=everman78&gt;Everman, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Adair's was the seventh name submitted by Garrard to the state Senate for the position; his approval by the Senate marked the end of a two-month imbroglio between Garrard and the legislature over the appointment.&lt;ref name=everman78 /&gt;  Later that year, he was a candidate for the U.S. Senate seat then occupied by [[John Brown (Kentucky)|John Brown]].&lt;ref name=remini37&gt;Remini, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[Henry Clay]] supported Brown's re-election, Adair had the support of [[Felix Grundy]].&lt;ref name=remini37 /&gt;  Grundy accused Brown of involvement in a conspiracy to make Kentucky a province of the Spanish government, damaging his popularity.&lt;ref name=remini37 /&gt;  Adair won a plurality, but not a majority, of the votes cast in six consecutive ballots.&lt;ref name=remini37 /&gt;  Clay then threw his support to [[Buckner Thruston]], a more palatable candidate who defeated Adair on the seventh ballot.&lt;ref name=remini37 /&gt; Grundy's influence in the legislature continued to grow, and when John Breckinridge resigned to accept President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s appointment as [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] in August 1805, the Senate chose Adair to fill the vacancy.&lt;ref name=remini37 /&gt;

==Charged with disloyalty==
Former Vice-President [[Aaron Burr]] visited Kentucky in 1805, reaching [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], on May 25 and lodging with former Senator John Brown.&lt;ref name=nhok85&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  During the trip, he consulted with many prominent politicians, Adair among them, about the possibility of wresting Mexico from Spain.&lt;ref name=nhok85 /&gt;  Most of those he spoke with believed he was acting on behalf of the federal government and intended to expand U.S. holdings in Mexico.&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;  Adair believed this too, having received letters from his former commander, James Wilkinson, which appeared to confirm it.&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;  In 1806, however, Burr was arrested in Frankfort on charges of [[treason]].  Officials claimed he in fact [[Burr conspiracy|intended to create a new, independent nation]] in Spanish lands.&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;

[[File:Vanderlyn Burr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man with receding gray hair tied in a braid, wearing a high-collared white shirt and black jacket|[[Aaron Burr]] and John Adair were charged with disloyalty to the U.S., but a grand jury failed to indict either of them]]
Convinced of his innocence, Henry Clay represented Burr, while [[Joseph Hamilton Daveiss]] acted as prosecutor.&lt;ref name=nhok86&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Harry Innes]] presided over the trial, which commenced November 11.&lt;ref name=nhok86 /&gt;  Daveiss had to ask for a postponement because [[Davis Floyd]], one of his key witnesses, was then serving in the [[Indiana General Assembly]] and could not be present in court.&lt;ref name=nhok86 /&gt;  The court next convened on December 2, and Daveiss again had to ask for a postponement, this time because Adair, another witness, was not present.&lt;ref name=nhok86 /&gt;  Adair had traveled to [[Louisiana]] to inspect a tract of land he had recently purchased there.&lt;ref name=bussey26 /&gt;  On his arrival in [[New Orleans]], he was arrested on the order of his former commander, James Wilkinson, then serving as governor of the [[Louisiana Territory]].&lt;ref name=hall1 /&gt;

Clay had insisted that the trial proceed in Adair's absence, and, the next day, Daveiss presented indictments against Burr for treason and against Adair as a co-conspirator.&lt;ref name=nhok86 /&gt;  After hearing testimony, the [[grand jury]] rejected the indictment against Adair as &quot;not a true bill&quot; and similarly dismissed the charges against Burr two days later.&lt;ref name=nhok86 /&gt;  After his vindication by the grand jury, Adair counter-sued Wilkinson in federal court.&lt;ref name=bussey27&gt;Bussey, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the legal battle between the two spanned several years, the court found that Wilkinson had no solid evidence against Adair and ordered Wilkinson to issue a public apology and pay Adair $2,500 in damages.&lt;ref name=bussey27 /&gt;  Adair's acquittal and successful counter-suit came too late to prevent damage to his political career.  Because of his association with Burr's scheme, he lost the election for a full term in the Senate in November 1806.&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;  Rather than wait for his partial term to expire, he resigned on November 18, 1806.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;

==Service in the War of 1812==
{{see also|Kentucky in the War of 1812}}
[[File:Isaac shelby.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A gray-haired man with a sullen expression wearing a high-collared white shirt, gold vest, and black jacket with gold buttons|Isaac Shelby appointed Adair adjutant general of Kentucky]]
Adair rejoined the Kentucky militia at the outset of the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name=hall1 /&gt;  After [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'s victory in the September 10, 1813, [[Battle of Lake Erie]], [[William Henry Harrison]] called on Kentucky Governor [[Isaac Shelby]], a popular Revolutionary War hero, to recruit troops in Kentucky and join him in his invasion of Canada.&lt;ref name=heidler1&gt;Heidler and Heidler, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Shelby asked Adair to serve as his first [[aide-de-camp]].&lt;ref name=young42&gt;Young, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Future Kentucky governor and U.S. Senator [[John J. Crittenden]] was Shelby's second aide, and future U.S. Senator and [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[William T. Barry]] was his secretary.&lt;ref name=young42 /&gt;  Adair rendered commendable service in the campaign, most notably at the American victory in the [[Battle of the Thames]] on October 5, 1813.&lt;ref name=powell26&gt;Powell, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Shelby praised Adair's service and in 1814, made him [[adjutant general]] of Kentucky and [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] him to the rank of brigadier general.&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;&lt;ref name=kyng /&gt;

In late 1814, [[Andrew Jackson]] requested reinforcements from Kentucky for his defense of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=heidler1/&gt;  Adair quickly raised three regiments, but the federal government provided them no weapons and no means of transportation.&lt;ref name=nhok93&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Taylor, Jr. (Kentucky)|James Taylor, Jr.]], then serving as [[quartermaster general]] of the state militia, took out a $6,000 mortgage on his personal land to purchase boats to transport Adair's men.&lt;ref name=nhok93 /&gt;  The number of men with Adair was later disputed; sources variously give numbers between 700 and 1,500.&lt;ref name=heidler1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nhok94&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  Many did not have weapons, and the ones who did were primarily armed with their own civilian rifles.&lt;ref name=heidler1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Niles' Weekly Register'' (February 4, 1815). vol. 7, p. 361: &quot;It appears that the steam-boat [[Enterprise (1814)|Enterprize]], and a keel boat, passed Louisville, Ky. about the 28th of December, with arms and various stores for New Orleans, and we fear it is so that gen. Adair's men are without arms.  However ''Jackson's'' fertile genius make them useful, or, perhaps, partially supply them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  John Thomas, to whom Adair was an adjunct, fell ill just before the battle commenced, leaving Adair responsible for all the Kentuckians present at the battle.&lt;ref name=gillig185&gt;Gillig, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 1815, Adair traveled to New Orleans and requested that the city's leaders lend him several stands of arms from the city armory to arm his militiamen.&lt;ref name=smith73&gt;Smith, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;  The officials agreed under the condition that the removal of the arms from the armory be kept secret from the citizenry.&lt;ref name=smith73 /&gt;  The weapons were placed in boxes and delivered to Adair's camp on the night of January 7.&lt;ref name=smith74&gt;Smith, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;  At Adair's suggestion, his men were placed in reserve and located centrally behind the [[Tennessee]] militiamen under [[William Carroll (Tennessee politician)|William Carroll]].&lt;ref name=smith74 /&gt;  From there, they could quickly move to reinforce whichever portion of the American line received the heaviest attack from the British.&lt;ref name=smith74 /&gt;

Apparently unaware of Adair's request, that evening, Jackson ordered 400 unarmed Kentucky militiamen under Colonel John Davis to march to New Orleans to obtain arms, then reinforce the 450 Louisiana militiamen under David B. Morgan on the west bank of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name=nhok94 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gillig182&gt;Gillig, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;  When they arrived in New Orleans, they were told that the city's arms had already been shipped to Adair.&lt;ref name=smith98&gt;Smith, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  The citizens collected what weapons they had&amp;nbsp;—mostly old muskets in various states of disrepair&amp;nbsp;—and gave them to Davis' men.&lt;ref name=smith98 /&gt;  About 200 men were thus armed and reported to Morgan as ordered, just hours before the start of the [[Battle of New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=gillig182 /&gt;  The remainder of Davis's men returned to the main camp, still without weapons.&lt;ref name=gillig182 /&gt;

As the British approached on the morning of January 8, it became evident that they would try to break the American line through Carroll's Tennesseans, and Adair advanced his men to support them.&lt;ref name=smith77&gt;Smith, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;  The main American line held and repulsed the British attack; in total, only six Americans were killed and seven wounded.&lt;ref name=gillig178&gt;Gillig, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Davis' Kentuckians on the west bank had, upon their arrival in Morgan's camp, been sent to meet the advance of a secondary British force.&lt;ref name=gillig182 /&gt;  Outnumbered, poorly armed, and without the benefit of breastworks or artillery support, they were quickly outflanked and forced to retreat.&lt;ref name=gillig182 /&gt;  Seeing the retreat of the Kentuckians, Morgan's militiamen abandoned their breastworks; Adair would later claim they had never even fired a shot.&lt;ref name=gillig182 /&gt;  The British quickly abandoned the position they had just captured, but Jackson resented the setback in an otherwise spectacular victory.&lt;ref name=gillig182 /&gt;

==Controversy with Andrew Jackson==
Jackson's official report blamed the Kentuckians' retreat for the collapse of the west bank defenses, and many Kentuckians felt it played down the importance of Adair's militiamen on the east bank in preserving the American line and securing the victory.&lt;ref name=smith106&gt;Smith, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gillig179&gt;Gillig, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis' men insisted the report was based on Jackson's misunderstanding of the facts and asked that Adair request a court of inquiry, which convened in February 1815 with Major General Carroll of Tennessee presiding.&lt;ref name=smith109&gt;Smith, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gillig184&gt;Gillig, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;  The court's report found that &quot;[t]he retreat of the Kentucky militia, which, considering their position, the deficiency of their arms, and other causes, may be excusable,&quot; and that the formation of the troops on the west bank was &quot;exceptional&quot;, noting that 500 Louisiana troops supported by three artillery pieces and protected by a strong breastwork were charged with defending a line that stretched only {{convert|200|yd|m}} while Davis's 170 Kentuckians, poorly armed and protected only by a small ditch, were expected to defend a line over {{convert|300|yd|m}} long.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 10, 1816, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a resolution thanking Adair for his service at the Battle of New Orleans and for his defense of the soldiers accused by Jackson.&lt;ref name=young126&gt;Young, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Willson Peale - portrait of Andrew Jackson, 1819.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man with graying, wavy hair wearing a high-collared black military jacket with gold epaulets and buttons|Andrew Jackson and Adair engaged in a public dispute over the conduct of the Kentucky militiamen at the Battle of New Orleans]]
Jackson approved the court's findings, but they were not the full refutation of Jackson's report that many Kentuckians&amp;nbsp;—including Adair&amp;nbsp;—had wanted.&lt;ref name=gillig184 /&gt;  In a letter that was quickly made public, Adair&amp;nbsp;—formerly one of Jackson's close friends&amp;nbsp;—insisted that Jackson withdraw or modify his official report, but Jackson refused.&lt;ref name=gillig184 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;  This ended the matter until June 1815 when H. P. Helm, secretary to John Thomas, forwarded to a Frankfort newspaper remarks from &quot;the general&quot; that had been annexed to the official report.&lt;ref name=gillig185 /&gt;  &quot;The remarks&quot; stated that the general was now convinced that the initial reports of cowardice by Davis's men &quot;had been misrepresented&quot; and that their retreat had been &quot;not only excusable, but absolutely justifiable.&quot;&lt;ref name=gillig185 /&gt;  The remarks, popularly believed to be from Jackson in response to Adair's letter, were subsequently reprinted across Kentucky.&lt;ref name=gillig185 /&gt; The &quot;general&quot; referenced was in fact General John Thomas; Jackson had never seen them.&lt;ref name=gillig185 /&gt;  Helm claimed he sent a subsequent correction to the newspaper that published the remarks, but it was never printed.&lt;ref name=gillig185 /&gt;

Jackson did not discover the remarks until they were published again in January 1817 in response to a Boston newspaper's criticism of Kentucky militiamen.&lt;ref name=gillig186&gt;Gillig, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote to the ''Kentucky Reporter'' at that time, denouncing the remarks as a forgery.&lt;ref name=gillig185 /&gt;  The ''Reporter'' investigated and published an explanation of how Thomas's remarks had been attributed to Jackson.&lt;ref name=gillig185 /&gt;  They did not reprint Jackson's letter because they felt his claim that the remarks had been intentionally forged&amp;nbsp;—a charge which was now found to be false&amp;nbsp;—was too inflammatory.&lt;ref name=gillig186 /&gt;  The editors promised that if their retraction did not satisfy Jackson, they would fully publish any of his additional remarks on the subject.&lt;ref name=gillig186 /&gt;  In Jackson's April 1817 response, he implied that Adair had intentionally misrepresented the remarks, and reasserted that they had been forged, possibly by Adair himself.&lt;ref&gt;Gillig, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt;  Adair believed Jackson's references to the remarks as a &quot;forged dish, dressed in the true Spanish style&quot; was a thinly veiled reference to Adair's alleged participation in the Burr conspiracy.&lt;ref name=gillig191&gt;Gillig, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;  As ostensible proof that he was not predisposed against Kentuckians, Jackson also implied that he had not reported additional dishonorable behavior by Kentucky militiamen during the battle.&lt;ref name=gillig189&gt;Gillig, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;  This letter thrust the dispute into the national spotlight and prompted Adair to resume correspondence with him both to defend Davis's men and refute Jackson's charges of conspiracy.&lt;ref name=powell26 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gillig190&gt;Gillig, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;  In his May 1817 response, he reasserted his defense of the Kentucky militiamen at New Orleans and dismissed many of Jackson's allegations as unimportant and untrue.&lt;ref&gt;Gillig, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt;  He flatly denied the existence of a conspiracy, and chastised Jackson for making charges without supporting evidence.&lt;ref name=gillig192&gt;Gillig, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;  Responding to Jackson's allusion to Spain, Adair recalled that Jackson had also been implicated with Burr.&lt;ref name=gillig192 /&gt;

Unable to provide tangible evidence of Adair's alleged misdeeds, Jackson provided indirect evidence that a conspiracy was possible.&lt;ref&gt;Gillig, pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt;  His response, delayed by his treaty negotiations with the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee]], was printed September 3, 1817, and used complicated calculations based on spacing and distance, to argue that Adair had only half the number of men he claimed to have commanded at the Battle of New Orleans.&lt;ref name=gillig192 /&gt;  Further, he claimed that Adair had ordered Davis to New Orleans to obtain weapons knowing that the arms had already been taken by other brigades under Adair's command.&lt;ref name=gillig194&gt;Gillig, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;  Either Adair had given a foolish order, or he did not have as many men in his main force as he claimed.&lt;ref name=gillig194 /&gt;  He closed by promising that this would be his last statement on the matter.&lt;ref name=gillig195&gt;Gillig, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;  Adair's October 29, 1817, response was delayed, he said, because he was awaiting documents from New Orleans that never came.&lt;ref name=gillig195 /&gt;  In it, he quoted from a letter to Jackson's aide-de-camp&amp;nbsp;—cited by Jackson himself in previous correspondence&amp;nbsp;—showing that Jackson had been made aware of both the existence and the authorship of Thomas's remarks in 1815 but declined the opportunity to refute them.&lt;ref name=gillig196&gt;Gillig, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;  He also defended his account of the number of troops under his command, which he had consistently reported as being near 1,000, and asked why Jackson had not challenged it until now.&lt;ref name=gillig196 /&gt;  Finally, he claimed that not only did he retrieve the weapons from New Orleans under Jackson's orders, but he rode Jackson's horse to New Orleans to effect the transaction.&lt;ref name=gillig197&gt;Gillig, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;  Tradition holds that this letter prompted either Adair or Jackson to challenge the other to a [[duel]], but friends of both men averted the conflict after assembling to watch; no written evidence of the event exists.&lt;ref name=gillig199&gt;Gillig, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Historian Zachariah Frederick Smith gives a detailed account of this tradition that he claims was told to him by a descendant of Adair's cousin. See Smith, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;  Tensions between the two eventually eased, and Adair came to comfort Jackson after his wife [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel]]'s death in 1828.&lt;ref name=gillig201&gt;Gillig, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;  Adair also campaigned for Jackson during his presidential campaigns in [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824]], [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828]], and [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832]].&lt;ref name=gillig201 /&gt;  Jackson's opponents compiled copies of his letters into campaign pamphlets to use against him in Kentucky during these elections.&lt;ref name=gillig180 /&gt;

==Governor of Kentucky==
[[File:Joseph Desha by Katherine Helm.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man with receding, red, curly hair wearing a white shirt and tie and black jacket|Joseph Desha, one of Adair's opponents in the gubernatorial election of 1820]]
Adair's participation in the War of 1812 and subsequent correspondence with Jackson restored his reputation.  He continued to serve as adjutant general until 1817, when the voters returned him to the state House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;&lt;ref name=kyng /&gt;  He was nominated for Speaker of the House during that term, and, although he was not elected, he drew support from members of both parties, largely because of his correspondence with Jackson.&lt;ref name=gillig180&gt;Gillig, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1819]]&amp;nbsp;—the first major financial crisis in United States history&amp;nbsp;—the primary political issue of the day was debt relief.&lt;ref name=doutrich15&gt;Doutrich, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal government had created the [[Second Bank of the United States]] in 1817, and its strict credit policy hit Kentucky's large debtor class hard.&lt;ref name=bussey27 /&gt;  Sitting governor [[Gabriel Slaughter]] had lobbied for some measures favored by the state's debtors, particularly punitive taxes against the branches of the Bank of the United States in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]].&lt;ref name=doutrich14&gt;Doutrich, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Second Party System]] had not yet developed, but there were nonetheless two opposing factions that arose around the debt relief issue.&lt;ref name=doutrich23&gt;Doutrich, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The first&amp;nbsp;—primarily composed of [[land speculation|land speculators]] who had bought large land parcels on credit and were unable to repay their debts due to the financial crisis&amp;nbsp;—was dubbed the Relief Party (or &quot;faction&quot;) and favored more legislation favorable to debtors.&lt;ref name=doutrich14 /&gt;  Opposed to them was the Anti-Relief Party; it was composed primarily of the state's aristocracy, many of whom were creditors to the land speculators and demanded that their contracts be adhered to without interference from the government.&lt;ref name=doutrich15 /&gt;  They claimed that no government intervention could effectively aid the debtors and that attempts to do so would only prolong the economic depression.&lt;ref name=doutrich15 /&gt;

Adair was the clear leader of the Relief faction, and his popularity had been enhanced thanks to his lengthy and public dispute with Jackson.&lt;ref name=doutrich23 /&gt;  In the 1820 gubernatorial election, he was elected as Kentucky's chief executive over three fellow [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]].&lt;ref name=nhok110&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;  Adair garnered 20,493 votes; U.S. Senator [[William Logan (Kentuckian)|William Logan]] finished second with 19,497, fellow veteran [[Joseph Desha]] received 12,419, and Colonel Anthony Butler mustered only 9,567 votes.&lt;ref name=young127&gt;Young, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of debt relief measures also won majorities in both houses of the General Assembly.&lt;ref name=nhok110 /&gt;

===Debt relief===
Kentucky historian [[Lowell H. Harrison]] opined that the most important measure implemented during Adair's administration was the creation of the [[Bank of the Commonwealth (Kentucky)|Bank of the Commonwealth]] in 1820.&lt;ref name=harrison2 /&gt;  The bank made generous loans and liberally issued paper money.&lt;ref name=harrison2 /&gt;  Although bank notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth quickly fell well below par, creditors who refused to accept these devalued notes had to wait two years before seeking [[replevin]].&lt;ref name=nhok110 /&gt;  To inspire confidence in the devalued notes, Adair mandated that all officers of the state receive their salaries in notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=stickles72&gt;Stickles, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The state's other bank, the Bank of Kentucky, adhered to more conservative banking practices.&lt;ref name=nhok110 /&gt;  While this held the value of its notes closer to par, it also rendered loans less available, which angered relief-minded legislators; consequently, they revoked the bank's charter in December 1822.&lt;ref name=nhok110 /&gt;  Adair oversaw the abolition of the practice of [[Debtors' prison|incarceration for debt]], and sanctioned rigorous anti-gambling legislation.&lt;ref name=nga&gt;&quot;Kentucky Governor John Adair&quot;. ''National Governors Association''&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislators also exempted from forced sale the items then considered necessary for making a living&amp;nbsp;—a horse, a plow, a hoe, and an ax.&lt;ref name=nhok110 /&gt;

The [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]], then the state's [[court of last resort]], struck down the law ordering a two-year stay of replevin because it impaired the [[Contract Clause|obligation of contracts]].&lt;ref name=harrison2 /&gt;  At about the same time, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] issued its decision in the case of ''[[Green v. Biddle]]'', holding that land claims granted by Virginia in the District of Kentucky before Kentucky became a separate state took precedence over those later granted by the state of Kentucky if the two were in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Stickles, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;  Adair denounced this decision in an 1823 message to the legislature, warning against federal and judicial interference in the will of the people, expressed through the legislature.&lt;ref name=stickles34&gt;Stickles, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Emboldened by Adair's message, Relief partisans sought to remove the three justices of the state Court of Appeals, as well as [[James Clark (Kentucky)|James Clark]], a lower court judge who had issued a similar ruling, from the bench.&lt;ref name=nhok110 /&gt;  The judges were spared when their opponents failed to obtain the [[two-thirds majority]] required for removal.&lt;ref name=nhok110 /&gt;

===Other matters of Adair's term===
Adair urged legislators to create a public school system.  In response, the General Assembly passed an act creating a state &quot;Literary Fund&quot; which received half of the clear profits accrued by the Bank of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=nhok149&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;  The fund was to be available, proportionally, to each of the state's counties for the establishment of &quot;a system of general education&quot;.&lt;ref name=ellis16&gt;Ellis, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  In the tumultuous economic environment, however, legislators routinely voted to borrow from the Literary Fund to pay for other priorities, chiefly the construction of [[internal improvements]].&lt;ref name=ellis17 /&gt;

[[File:William T. Barry by C.B. King.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man with dark, curly hair wearing a white shirt and black jacket|William T. Barry, Adair's lieutenant governor]]
Adair's [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]], William T. Barry, and [[John Pope (Kentucky)|John Pope]], Secretary of State under Adair's predecessor, headed a six-man committee authorized by the act to study the creation of a system of [[common school]]s.&lt;ref name=nhok149 /&gt;  The &quot;Barry Report,&quot; delivered to the legislature in December 1822, was lauded by such luminaries as [[John Adams]], Thomas Jefferson, and [[James Madison]].&lt;ref name=nhok149 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ellis16 /&gt;  Authored by committee member [[Amos Kendall]], it criticized the idea of land grant academies then prevalent in the state as unworkable outside affluent towns.&lt;ref name=ellis17&gt;Ellis, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  It also concluded that the Literary Fund alone was insufficient for funding a system of common schools.&lt;ref name=ellis17 /&gt;  The report recommended that funds only be made available to counties that imposed a county tax for the benefit of the public school system.&lt;ref name=ellis17 /&gt;  Legislators largely ignored the report, a decision Kentucky historian [[Thomas D. Clark]] called &quot;one of the most egregious blunders in American educational history&quot;.&lt;ref name=ellis17 /&gt;

Adair's endorsement of the [[Missouri Compromise]] was instrumental in securing its passage by Kentucky legislators.&lt;ref name=hall1 /&gt; He advocated prison reform and better treatment of the insane.&lt;ref name=harrison2 /&gt;  He also oversaw the enactment of a plan for internal improvements, including improved navigation on the [[Ohio River]].&lt;ref name=harrison2 /&gt;

==Later life==
Barred from seeking immediate re-election by the [[Kentucky Constitution|state constitution]], Adair retired to his farm in Mercer County at the expiration of his term as governor.&lt;ref name=harrison2 /&gt;  Shortly after returning to private life, he began to complain about the low value of Bank of the Commonwealth notes&amp;nbsp;—then worth about half par&amp;nbsp;—and petitioned the legislature to remedy the situation.&lt;ref name=stickles72 /&gt;  The complaint of a former Relief Party governor over the ill effects of pro-relief legislation prompted wry celebration among members of the Anti-Relief faction.&lt;ref name=stickles72 /&gt;

Adair made one final contribution to the public when he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Jackson Democrat]] in 1831.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;  During the [[22nd United States Congress|22nd Congress]], he served on the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Military Affairs]].&lt;ref name=smith170&gt;Smith, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  During his term, he made only one speech, and it was so inaudible that no one knew what position he was advocating.&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;  The House reporter speculated that it concerned mounting Federal troops on horseback.&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;  He did not run for re-election in 1833, and left public life for good.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
He died at home in [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky|Harrodsburg]] on May 19, 1840, and was buried on the grounds of his estate, White Hall.&lt;ref name=powell26 /&gt;  In 1872, his remains were moved to the [[Frankfort Cemetery]], by the [[Old State Capitol (Kentucky)|state capitol]], and the Commonwealth erected a marker over his grave there.&lt;ref name=dab /&gt;

In addition to Adair County in Kentucky, [[Adair County, Missouri]], [[Adair County, Iowa]], and the towns of [[Adairville, Kentucky]], and [[Adair, Iowa]], were named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Gannett, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Euntaek, &quot;Jesse James&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
