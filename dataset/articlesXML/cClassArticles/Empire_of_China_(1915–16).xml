The '''Empire of China''' ({{zh|t=中華帝國|s=中华帝国|p=Zhōnghuá Dìguó}}) was a short-lived attempt by statesman and general [[Yuan Shikai]] from late 1915 to early 1916 to reinstate [[Emperor of China|monarchy in China]], with himself as the '''Hongxian Emperor''' ({{zh||s=洪宪皇帝|t=洪憲皇帝|p=Hóngxiàn Huángdì}}). The attempt was ultimately a failure; it set back the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Chinese republican]] cause by many years and fractured China into a period of  conflict between various local warlords.

== Preparations for formation ==
After [[Yuan Shikai]] was installed as the second Provisional Great [[President of the Republic of China]], he took various steps to consolidate his power and remove opposition leaders from office. To secure his own power he collaborated with various European powers as well as [[Japan]]. Around August 1915, he instructed [[Yang Du]] (楊度) ''et al.'' to canvass support for a return of a monarchy. On 11 December 1915, an assembly unanimously elected him as Emperor.  Yuan ceremonially declined, but &quot;relented&quot; and immediately agreed when the National Assembly petitioned again that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROCannals&quot;&gt;Kuo T'ing-i et al. ''Historical Annals of the ROC (1911–1949).'' Vol 1. pp 207–41.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December, Yuan, supported by his son [[Yuan Keding]], declared the Empire of China with himself as the &quot;Great Emperor of the Chinese Empire&quot; ({{zh|s=中华帝国大皇帝|t=中華帝國大皇帝|p=Zhōnghuá Dìguó Dà Huángdì}}), taking the [[era name]] Hongxian ({{zh|s=洪宪|t=洪憲|p=Hóngxiàn}}, &quot;Constitutional Abundance&quot;). However, Yuan, now known as the Hongxian Emperor, delayed the accession rites until 1 January 1916.  A dress rehearsal was sabotaged by his [[Koreans|Korean]] concubine. Soon after, the Hongxian Emperor started handing out titles of [[peerage]] to his closest relatives and friends, as well as those whom he thought he could buy with titles.

The [[Aisin Gioro]] family, then living within the [[Forbidden City]] but as foreign monarchs rather than Chinese ones, &quot;approved&quot; of the Hongxian Emperor's accession, and even proposed a &quot;royal marriage&quot; of the emperor's daughter to [[Puyi]].

==Backlash==
[[Image:Yuan shikai.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Yuan Shikai]] as the Hongxian Emperor]]
The year 1916 was to be &quot;Hongxian Year 1&quot; (洪憲元年) rather than &quot;Republic Year 5&quot; (民國五年),&lt;ref name=&quot;ROCannals&quot; /&gt; but the Hongxian Emperor was opposed by not only the revolutionaries, but far more importantly by his subordinate military commanders, who believed that Yuan's assumption of the monarchy would allow him to rule without depending on the support of the military.

Province after province rebelled after his inauguration, starting with [[Yunnan]], led by the emperor's governor [[Cai E]] and general [[Tang Jiyao]] and Jiangxi, led by governor [[Li Liejun]] (李烈鈞). The revolters formed the National Protection Army (護國軍) and thus began the [[National Protection War]]. This was followed by other provinces declaring independence from the Empire. The emperor's Beiyang generals, whose soldiers had not received pay once from the imperial government, did not put up an aggressive campaign against the National Protection Army and the [[Beiyang Army]] suffered numerous defeats despite being better trained and equipped than the National Protection Army.

Seeing the Hongxian Emperor's weakness and unpopularity, foreign powers withdrew their support (but did not choose sides in the war). The [[Empire of Japan]] first threatened to invade, then committed to overthrowing the Hongxian Emperor and recognised both sides of the conflict to be &quot;in a state of war&quot; and allowed Japanese citizens to help the Republicans.&lt;ref name= &quot;ROCannals&quot; /&gt; Faced with universal opposition, the emperor repeatedly delayed the accession rites to appease his foes. Funding for the ceremony was cut on 1 March. Yuan deliberated abandoning the monarchy with [[Liang Shiyi]] on 17 March and abandoned it on 22 March. The &quot;Hongxian&quot; year was abolished on 23 March and the &quot;Republic&quot; calendrical system restored. Yuan reigned a total of 83 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROCannals&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:Empire of China-Hunan-10 cash coin.png|thumb|right|150px|Empire of China ten-[[Chinese cash (currency)|cash]] coin dated &quot;Hongxian Year 1&quot;]]
After Yuan's death on 5 June Vice President [[Li Yuanhong]] assumed the presidency, and appointed Beiyang general [[Duan Qirui]] as his Premier and restored the National Assembly and the provisional Constitution.  However, the central authority of the Beijing government was significantly weakened and the demise of Yuan's Empire plunged China into a [[warlord era|period of warlordism]].

==National symbols==

Although the name of the country in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was changed to the &quot;Empire of China&quot; (and &quot;Hongxian&quot; for state matters), the Hongxian Emperor continued to use &quot;Republic of China&quot; as the English name.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROCannals&quot; /&gt;

The Hongxian Emperor set up the Ritual Regulations Office (禮制館), which issued the new official anthem for the Republic of China &quot;''China heroically stands in the Universe''&quot; ([[:zh:中華雄立宇宙間|中華雄立宇宙間]]) in June 1915. Its lyrics were written by Yin Chang (廕昌) and music by Wang Lu (王露). The lyrics was slightly modified in December 1915, with 共和五族 (Five Races Under One Union) replaced by 勳華揖讓 (Shanrang, the ancient system of Chinese emperor relinquishing seats to others in Yao and Shun's era. ) to be used during the Hongxian Emperor's reign.

Yao was a legendary Chinese ruler. The era of ''Yao'' and ''[[Shun (ruler)|Shun]]'' (堯天舜日) is a [[Chengyu|Four-character idiom]] which means times of peace and prosperity.

The national flag was changed from the original [[:Image:Flag of the Republic of China 1912-1928.svg|5-stripe flag]] to one where the red stripe is a centered cross; however, a flag with the former red stripe as a [[saltire]] was the version commonly used.

The national emblem remained as the national emblem of the Republic of China (1913 - 1928), [[Blue Sky with a White Sun#National Emblem and History|National emblem of Twelve Symbols of Sovereignty]] (十二章國徽).
