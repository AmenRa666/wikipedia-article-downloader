'''SMS ''Budapest''''' {{efn|name=SMS}} (&quot;His Majesty's Ship Budapest&quot;) was a {{sclass-|Monarch|coastal defense ship}} built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in the 1890s. After their commissioning, ''Budapest'' and the two other ''Monarch''-class ships made several training cruises in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the early 1900s. ''Budapest'' and her [[sister ship|sisters]] formed the 1st Capital Ship Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy until they were replaced by the newly commissioned {{sclass-|Habsburg|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s at the turn of the century. In 1906 the three Monarchs were placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] and only recommissioned during the annual summer training exercises. After the start of [[World War I]], ''Budapest'' was recommissioned and assigned to 5th Division together with her sisters.

The division was sent to [[Cattaro]] in August 1914 to attack [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] and French artillery that was bombarding the port, and they remained there until mid-1917. ''Budapest'' and her sister {{SMS|Wien||2}} were sent to [[Trieste]] in August and bombarded Italian fortifications in the [[Gulf of Trieste]]. The ship was briefly [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in early 1918 and became an [[accommodation ship]], but she was fitted with a large [[Siege gun|siege howitzer]] for [[shore bombardment]] shortly afterwards and recommissioned. A shortage of ammunition caused the gun to be removed before it could be used, and ''Budapest'' reverted to her previous role. The ship was awarded to Great Britain by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1920. The British sold her for [[ship breaking|scrap]], and she was broken up in Italy beginning in 1921.

== Description and construction==
{{main|Monarch-class coastal defense ship}}
[[File:Monarch-class.jpg|thumb|left|Right elevation and plan of the ''Monarch'' class; the shaded area is armored.]]

At only {{convert|5785|t|LT|0}} maximum displacement,{{sfn|Sieche|p=256}} the ''Monarch'' class was less than half the size of the [[battleship]]s of other major navies at the time{{sfn|Sokol|p=67}} and were officially designated as coast defense ships.{{sfn|Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik|p=272}} The Austro-Hungarian government believed that the role of its navy was solely to defend her coast.{{sfn|Sokol|p=67}}

''Budapest'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|99.22|m|ftin|sp=us}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.4|m|ftin|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik|p=272}} Her two 4-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] produced a total of {{convert|9100|ihp|kW|lk=in}} using steam from 16 [[Belleville boiler]]s. These gave the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|17.8|knots|lk=in}}. ''Budapest''{{'}}s maximum load of {{convert|500|t|lt|sp=us}} of coal gave her a range of {{convert|3500|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|9|kn}}. She was manned by 26 officers and 397 enlisted men, a total of 423 personnel.{{sfn|Noppen|pp=6, 8}}

The armament of the ''Monarch'' class consisted of four {{convert|240|mm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} [[Krupp]] K/94 guns mounted in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft of the [[superstructure]]. The ships carried 80 rounds for each gun. Their [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] was six {{convert|150|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on|0}} [[Škoda Works|Škoda guns]] located in [[casemate]]s in the superstructure. Defense against [[torpedo boat]]s was provided by ten [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] {{convert|47|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} Škoda guns and four 47-millimeter QF [[Hotchkiss gun]]s. The ships also mounted two {{convert|450|mm|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one on each [[broadside]]. Each torpedo tube was provided with two [[torpedo]]es.{{sfn|Noppen|pp=6, 8}}

The ship's nickel-steel [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] was {{convert|120|-|270|mm|1|sp=us}} thick, and the gun turrets were protected by {{convert|250|mm|1|sp=us}} of armor. The casemates had {{convert|80|mm|1|sp=us}} thick sides while the [[conning tower]] had {{convert|220|mm|1|sp=us}} of armor. ''Budapest''{{'}}s [[deck (ship)|deck]] armor was {{convert|40|mm|1|sp=us}} thick.{{sfn|Noppen|p=8}}

The ''Monarch''-class ships were ordered in May 1892{{sfn|Sieche|p=227}} with ''Budapest'' and ''Wien'' to be built at the [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] shipyard in [[Trieste]]. Both ships were [[Keel|laid down]] on 16 February 1893, the first ships in the class to be laid down.{{sfn|Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik|p=272}} ''Budapest'' was launched on 27 April 1896 by Countess Marie Széchényí-Andrássy, wife of the Governor of [[Fiume]], and commissioned on 12 May 1898.{{sfn|Sieche|pp=234, 240}}

== Service history ==

=== Peace time ===
[[File:SMS Wien painting.PNG|250px|left|thumb|A painting from [[Alexander Kircher]] showing SMS ''Wien'' and the other ships of the ''Monarch'' class on maneuvers]]

''Budapest'' and her sisters formed the Navy's 1st Capital Ship Division (''I. Schwere Division''), and ''Budapest'' conducted the first [[wireless telegraphy]] trials in the Navy when she was briefly fitted with a [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] [[radio]] in December 1898. In late 1899 the division made a training cruise to the Eastern Mediterranean where they made port visits in Greece, Lebanon, Turkey and [[Malta]]. In early 1902 they made another training cruise to the Western Mediterranean with port visits in Algeria, Spain, France, Italy, [[Corfu]], and [[Albania]]. The ship was fitted with a [[Siemens]]-Braun radio early the following year. The ships of the division were inspected by [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], the heir to the throne, in March 1903 at [[Gruž|Gravosa]]. Shortly afterwards, ''Budapest'', ''Wien'', the battleship {{SMS|Habsburg||2}} and the [[destroyer]] {{SMS|Magnet||2}} made a cruise to the Eastern Mediterranean. In 1904, the ''Monarch''-class ships formed the 2nd Capital Ship Division,{{sfn|Sieche|pp=240, 245}} and they took part in the 1904 cruise of the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas as well as training exercises in which the three {{sclass-|Habsburg|battleship|2}}s engaged the ''Budapest'' and her sisters in simulated combat. Those maneuvers marked the first time two homogeneous squadrons consisting of modern battleships operated in the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=158}}

The ''Monarch''s were relegated to the newly formed Reserve Squadron on 1 January 1906 and were only recommissioned for the annual summer exercises. They participated in a fleet review by Archduke Franz Ferdinand in September conducted in the Kolocepski Channel near [[Šipan]]. The ships were briefly recommissioned at the beginning of 1913 as the 4th Division after the start of the [[Second Balkan War]], but were decommissioned again on 10 March.{{sfn|Sieche|pp=245–46}}

=== World War I ===
[[File:Italien 1905.png|thumb|right|A map of the upper [[Adriatic Sea]]]]
With the beginning of World War I the three ''Monarch''s were recommissioned as the 5th Division. They were sent to the [[Bay of Kotor]] in August 1914 to attack Montenegrin [[artillery batteries]] on [[Mount Lovćen]] bombarding the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Cattaro and the fortifications defending it. ''Budapest'' and her sisters arrived on 13 August, but their guns could not elevate enough to engage all of the enemy artillery, which was reinforced by eight French guns on 19 October. The battleship {{SMS|Radetzky||2}} was summoned to deal with the guns two days later, and she managed to knock out several French guns and forced the others to withdraw by 27 October. The ''Monarch''s remained at Cattaro until mid-1917 to deter any further attacks. In August, ''Budapest'' and ''Wien'' were transferred to Trieste to serve as [[guard ship]]s against Italian commando raids. Each ship was fitted with a {{convert|66|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[anti-aircraft gun]] after their arrival on 26 August to counter intense Italian air attacks. ''Wien'' was damaged by a near miss on 5 September, and both ships withdrew to [[Pula|Pola]] on 12 September.{{sfn|Sieche|pp=246, 250}}

They returned to Trieste on 30 October{{sfn|Sieche|p=250}} and [[sortie]]d into the Gulf of Trieste on 16 November to attack Italian [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal defenses]] at [[Cortellazzo]], near the mouth of the [[Piave River]]. ''Budapest'' and ''Wien'' opened fire at 10:35 at a range of about {{convert|9|-|10|km|sp=us}} and knocked out most of the Italian guns after about a half-hour. Their bombardment was interrupted by several unsuccessful Italian air attacks before a more coordinated attack was made by five [[MAS (boat)|MAS torpedo boats]] and five aircraft around 13:30. This was also unsuccessful, and the last Italian coast defense gun was knocked out an hour later. The ships had sustained only minor damage from several hits and near-misses, and not a single sailor was wounded.{{sfn|Noppen|pp=34, 36}}
 
[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles I of Austria|Karl]] inspected ''Budapest'' on 19 November at Trieste.{{sfn|Sieche|p=250}} Anxious to revenge themselves against the Austro-Hungarians, the Royal [[Italian Navy]] (''Regia Marina'') planned an attack on the two ships in their berths in the [[Bay of Muggia]], near Trieste, by MAS boats.{{sfn|Noppen|p=37}} On the night of 9/10 December, two MAS boats managed to penetrate the harbor defenses undetected, and fired torpedoes at ''Wien'' and ''Budapest''. The torpedoes fired at the ''Budapest'' struck the [[mole (architecture)|mole]] of the [[seaplane]] station,{{sfn|Sieche|p=250}} but ''Wien'' was hit twice and [[capsized]] in five minutes, killing 46 of the crew.{{sfn|Noppen|p=38}}

''Budapest'' was scheduled for a shore bombardment on 12 December, but was postponed for a week by bad weather. Escorted by the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Admiral Spaun||2}}, six destroyers, nine torpedo boats and a dozen [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s, ''Budapest'' and the pre-dreadnought {{SMS|Árpád||2}} bombarded the Castellazzo fortifications on 19 December. The ship transferred to Pola two days later, and she was decommissioned on 11 March 1918. She became the accommodation ship for the submarine staff (''Wohnschiff der U-Bootleitung''). Just over a week later, [[Admiral]] [[Franz von Keil]] proposed that a [[38 cm Belagerungshaubitze M 16|38-centimeter siege howitzer]] be installed to bombard the Castellazzo fortifications. Little time was wasted, and removal of the forward gun turret and its [[barbette]] began on 26 March. The installation of the {{convert|38|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} gun was completed on 4 April although testing did not begin until 5 June when three shots were fired. The ship was recommissioned two days later with a reduced crew, and a practice shoot was conducted with unsatisfactory results on 6 August. Another training exercise scheduled for 20 August had to be cancelled for lack of ammunition. The howitzer was removed on 11 October and sent to the Army on 17 October. ''Budapest'' resumed her former role and remained at Pola. She was handed over to Great Britain as war reparations in January 1920 and broken up for scrap in Italy in 1921.{{sfn|Sieche|pp=253–54}}
