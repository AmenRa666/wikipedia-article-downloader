The '''Beechcraft CT-134 Musketeer''' was a military training derivative of the [[Beechcraft Musketeer|Musketeer]] built by [[Beechcraft]] for the [[Canadian Forces]].  The CT-134 was a single engine, low-wing, four-seat [[General aviation|light aircraft]] with fixed [[landing gear]] and a limited [[aerobatics|aerobatic]] capability.

==Design and development==

In the early 1960s the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]’s standard elementary training aircraft was the [[de Havilland Chipmunk|de Havilland DHC-1 Chipmunk]]. Flight instruction was completed by student pilots on the DHC-1 before they progressed to the then-brand-new [[Canadair CL-41 Tutor|Canadair CT-114 Tutor]] jet trainer. A decision was made by RCAF HQ to remove the DHC-1s from service and not replace them, as it was felt that the CT-114 was easy enough to fly that initial training was not needed. The CT-114 quickly developed a wash-out rate of near 95% amongst student jet pilots and it was clear that an elementary trainer was needed. Due to the RCAF’s previous customer relationship with Beechcraft while operating that company's [[Beechcraft Model 18|Expeditor]] twin-engine aircraft, a hasty purchase of twenty-four B23 Musketeers was made in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;DND&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/v2/equip/hst/musketeer-eng.asp |title = Beech CT-134 Musketeer |date = 2004-04-06 |author = Air Force Public Affairs / Department of National Defence |accessdate = 2007-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first CT-134 arrived at [[CFB Portage la Prairie]] on March 23, 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milberry&quot;&gt;Milberry, Larry: ''Sixty Years - The RCAF and Air Command 1924-1984'', page 384. McGraw Hill Ryerson Canav Books, 1984. ISBN 0-07-549484-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The new trainers were designated '''CT-134 Musketeer''' in the then [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Armed Forces]]. The aircraft purchased were standard Model B23s equipped with the O-360-A4G engine of {{convert|180|bhp|abbr=on}}, modified by the addition of a cowling [[strake (aviation)|strake]], [[horizontal stabilizer]] strake and ventral fin to improve spin recovery performance. They were initially serial numbered as 13401-13424, but were re-numbered 134001-134024 to avoid confusion with other CF aircraft serial numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;DND&quot;/&gt;

The initial batch of CT-134s was replaced in late 1981 with a purchase of twenty-four more aircraft. These were 1982 model Beechcraft C23 Sundowners and were designated by the CF as '''CT-134A Musketeer II'''. These were numbered 134025-134048.&lt;ref name=&quot;DND&quot;/&gt;

The CT-134 was approved for limited aerobatics, including loops, rolls, [[chandelle]]s and [[lazy eight]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;C-12-134-000/MC-000&quot;&gt;DAOT: ''C-12-134-000/MC-000 Canadian Forces Technical Order Operating Checklist Musketeer CT 134,'', CFTMPC, 10 Jul 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==

Both batches of Musketeers served with [[3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School]] and the [[Canadian Forces Flying Instructor School]] at CFB Portage la Prairie [[Manitoba]] and the [[Canadian Forces Central Flying School]] in [[Winnipeg]] until they were replaced by [[T-67 Firefly|Slingsby Firefly]]s operated under contract by [[Bombardier Aerospace]] in [[1992 in aviation|1992]]. During their 21 years of service the CT-134 and CT-134A fleet at 3 CFFTS trained about 5000 Canadian military pilot graduates.

In operational service the CT-134 suffered very few accidents. One of the few serious accidents occurred on 23 March 1990 when Musketeer 134229 had an engine failure on take-off from [[Erickson Municipal Airport]] at [[Erickson, Manitoba]] while giving familiarization flights to [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]]. The accident was caused by [[fuel starvation]] and the aircraft was written off.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilberryAirCom&quot;&gt;Milberry, Larry: ''Aircom: Canada's Air Force'', pages 82-83. Canav Books, 1991. ISBN 0-921022-05-0&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintenance of the CT-134 fleet was primarily carried out by the CFB Portage la Prairie Base Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Organization, with Depot Level Inspection and Repair (DLIR) being conducted by Field Aviation at [[Calgary International Airport]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MilberryAirCom&quot;/&gt;

Upon retirement the CT-134s and CT-134As were not sold for flying use due to the structural problems they all suffered from years of aerobatics.&lt;ref name=&quot;RCAF.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rcaf.com/Aircraft/aircraftDetail.php?MUSKETEER-194|title = Beech CT-134 MUSKETEER|accessdate = 2008-04-01|last = AEROWARE / RCAF.com |authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead they were donated to museums or used for air force and civil maintenance training.  Some CT-134s still serve as monuments at a few current and former [[Canadian Forces Base]]s as well as [[Royal Canadian Legion]] halls, a distinction held by very few light aircraft in this class.,&lt;ref name=&quot;DND&quot;/&gt;

In Canadian military service the aircraft was referred to by student and instructor pilots by the nickname [[Muskrat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DND&quot;/&gt;
