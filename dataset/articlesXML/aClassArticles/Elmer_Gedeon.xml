'''Elmer John Gedeon''' (April 15, 1917 – April 20, 1944) was a professional baseball player, appearing in several games for the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] in {{mlby|1939}}.  Gedeon and [[Harry O'Neill (catcher)|Harry O'Neill]] were the only two [[Major League Baseball]] players killed during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Weintraub /&gt; Gedeon flew several missions in the [[European Theater of Operations]] as an officer of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] before being shot down over France.

During college at the [[University of Michigan]], Gedeon became an [[All-American]] in [[track and field]], and earned [[varsity letter]]s in both [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]]. He tied a [[world record]] in the high [[Hurdling|hurdles]] in 1938.  After graduating, Gedeon had a stint in Major League Baseball as an [[outfielder]] for the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]].  Gedeon spent most of the 1939 and 1940 baseball seasons in the minor leagues, but he was called up to the Senators in September 1939.

Gedeon's baseball career was cut short when he was [[military draft|drafted]] by the [[United States Army]] in early 1941.  He trained as a [[bomber]] pilot, and was decorated for bravery after his plane crashed on a training flight in 1942.  He later served in combat, and was shot down and killed while [[Aviator|piloting]] a [[B-26 Marauder|B-26 bomber]] on a mission over France in April 1944.

== Growing up in Cleveland ==
Born in [[Cleveland]], Gedeon was a star athlete at Cleveland's [[West High School (Cleveland)|West High School]], where he was a member of the class of 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CPDB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F8035370FB7CEAF&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Modell Says Browns Will Return To Top|accessdate=2008-12-23|date=1991-11-18|agency=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|author=Heaton, Chuck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CPDB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F80D09024FE94DD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Missing Plaque A Part of History|accessdate=2008-12-23|date=1998-09-24|agency=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|author=Dirck, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a {{height|ft=6|in=4}} athlete who excelled in American football, baseball, and [[track and field]]. While [[ice skating]] in [[Old Brooklyn|Brookside Park]] in Cleveland as a youth, the ice gave way and Gedeon's cousin plunged through up to his neck.  The cousin later recalled:  &quot;Elmer slid across the ice on his belly and pulled me out.&quot;&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt;  Gedeon's uncle, [[Joe Gedeon]], was a [[Major League Baseball]] player who was implicated in the [[Black Sox Scandal|Chicago Black Sox scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;pid=4991&amp;bid=238|accessdate=2007-12-07|title=Joe Gedeon|author=Swaine, Rick|publisher=The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) &amp; The Respective Authors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gedeon's [[surname]] was common in Cleveland, because many people from [[Sudetenland]], where it was common, settled in Cleveland.&lt;ref name=RGeMDBldiW/&gt;  The phonebook listed numerous Gedeons for biographical research.  One finding was that Gedeon's widow, who was named Laura, later moved to Florida.&lt;ref name=RGeMDBldiW/&gt; Another was that his third cousin Charlotte Gedeon said Elmer carried her grandmother's [[casket]] during a funeral.&lt;ref name=RGeMDBldiW/&gt;

In 1937, a feature article on the Michigan team noted that, in addition to his abilities as an end, &quot;Gedeon can pass and punt, and can run faster than any one on the squad.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stauter, George|title=Vets, Not Sophs, Showing Best Wares Among Wolves|work=[[The Post-Crescent]]|date=1937-09-30|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In 1938, Gedeon played [[End (American football)|end]] in Coach [[Fritz Crisler]]'s first season as Michigan's football coach.  That was the year that Coach Crisler introduced the &quot;[[winged football helmet]]&quot; at Michigan.

Gedeon signed with the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] after graduating in the summer of 1939.&lt;ref name=GBEGSABR/&gt; He chose to sign with the Senators over a possible appearance as a member of the USA's track team in the [[1940 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=RGeMDBldiW/&gt; Gedeon was quite a prospect; [[Clark Griffith]], president of the Senators, mentioned Gedeon to ''[[The Sporting News]]'' on June 15, when talking about exciting new players: &quot;We've got ... a youngster from the University of Michigan named Gedeon.&quot;&lt;ref name=BIW/&gt; Gedeon was initially assigned to a [[minor league baseball]] team in [[Orlando, Florida]] where he played in 67 games in 1939.&lt;ref name=GBEGSABR/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWWIIA&gt;{{cite news|author=Morris, R.|title=Remembering World War II airmen: Website remembers baseball players killed in World War Two|publisher=Untold Valor|date=2007-06-24|url=http://untoldvalor.blogspot.com/2007/06/website-remembers-baseball-players.html|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-September, he was called up to the major leagues where he appeared in five games as an outfielder with three hits, one run and one RBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elmer Gedeon Major League Baseball Career Statistics|publisher=BR.com|date=2007-10-28|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gedeoel01.shtml|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His three hits came in a 10–9 win against the [[Cleveland Indians]] on September 19 as the starting [[centerfielder]]. In his five major league games, he played four games in center field and one in [[right field]].&lt;ref name=BIW/&gt;

In 1940, Gedeon attended spring training with the Senators in Orlando, seeking a spot in the outfield or first base. In February 1940, newspapers ran a wire service photograph of Gedeon hurdling over Senators first baseman [[Jimmy Wasdell]], supposedly &quot;by way of warming up&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hurdler To Try Majors|work=The News-Palladium (Benton Harbor, Mich.)|date=1940-02-19|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; returned to the minor leagues where he played for the [[Charlotte Hornets (baseball)|Charlotte Hornets]] (in the [[Piedmont League]]) and hit .271 in 131 games.&lt;ref name=GBEGSABR/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWWIIA/&gt;  He was again recalled in September, but he made no appearances in any games.&lt;ref name=BIW/&gt; It appeared 1941 would see Gedeon moving to play more minor league baseball for either Greenville or Springfield. In the interim Gedeon served as an assistant football coach at Michigan.&lt;ref name=BIW/&gt;

== Military service and death in World War II ==
Gedeon was drafted into the military in January 1941, and reported to the Army instead of spring training.&lt;ref name=RWWIIA/&gt;  He was inducted at [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky]] and reported to the Cavalry Replacement Center at [[Fort Riley]] on March 18.  He immediately became an acting [[Corporal#United States|corporal]] of Troop B of the First Squadron for the thirteen-week training program. The Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan owns a copy of an April 1941 [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] newsletter with a note from Gedeon. &quot;As you probably know by this time&quot;, he wrote to his [[Phi Gamma Delta]] brothers, &quot;Old Ged has been drafted.&quot;&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt;  On being assigned to the cavalry, Gedeon joked in the letter to his fraternity that &quot;the only horse I ever saw in my life was the one the milkman used.&quot;&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt;

On October 22, 1941, Gedeon was accepted into pilot training despite his size and transferred to the [[United States Army Air Forces]], earning his [[pilot's wings]] and a commission as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] at [[Williams Air Force Base|Williams Field, Arizona]] in May 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;bedseam&quot;/&gt;  He undertook twin-engined bomber training with the [[21st Operations Group|21st Bomb Group]] at [[MacDill Field]] in [[Tampa, Florida]].&lt;ref name=BIW/&gt; Gedeon's usual duties were to aid in European mission planning from a desk.&lt;ref name=TWDNR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/sports/baseball/remembering-the-major-leaguers-who-died-in-world-war-ii.html|title=Two Who Did Not Return|accessdate=2013-05-26|date=2013-05-26|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Weintraub, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 1942, Gedeon was flying as the [[navigator]] in a [[B-25]] that crashed in the middle of a swamp on take off from the municipal airport at [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crash&gt;{{cite news|title=Athlete Hurt in Crash of Bomber|work=The News-Palladium (Benton Harbor, Mich.)|date=1942-08-10|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gedeon crawled from the burning bomber, and despite burns and three broken ribs, he went back into the wreckage, rescuing a crewmate, Corporal John R.

It's going to be good flying from now on.' He said he had used up his bad luck.&quot;&lt;ref name=UMASPSWWII/&gt; In February 1943, the [[Associated Press]] ran a feature story about Gedeon's war service under the headline: &quot;Gedeon Will Return to Baseball If War Doesn’t Last Too Long.&quot;&lt;ref name=GWRtGIWDLTL&gt;{{cite news|title=Gedeon Will Return to Baseball If War Doesn’t Last Too Long|work=The Times Recorder (Zanesville, Ohio)|date=1943-02-10|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gedeon was quoted in the article as saying &quot;he hopes to pick up after the war where he left off.&quot;  He added that &quot;it's a matter of time.&quot;  &quot;If the war ends before I’m past the playing age I’ll return to the game.  If I’m too old, I’ll do something else.&quot;&lt;ref name=GWRtGIWDLTL/&gt;

[[File:394bg-boreham-2.jpg|thumb|B-26 Marauder of the 394th Bomb Group at RAF Boreham.]]
In July 1943, Gedeon was among personnel from the 21st BG that became the cadre of the [[586th Flight Test Squadron|586th Bomb Squadron]], [[394th Bombardment Group]] [[United States Army Air Forces]], formed to train with Martin [[B-26 Marauder]]s. At [[Ardmore Air Force Base|Ardmore Army Air Field]], [[Oklahoma]], he participated in group operational training in preparation for combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;bedseam&quot;/&gt; In February 1944, the group was sent to [[RAF Boreham]], England, to become part of the [[Ninth Air Force]].  Gedeon was assigned as Squadron Operations Officer and began flying combat missions in Europe.&lt;ref name=BIW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballinwartime.com/player_biographies/gedeon_elmer.htm|title=Elmer Gedeon|accessdate=2007-12-07|publisher=Gary Bedingfield (Baseball in Wartime)|date=2007-05-19|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407224822/http://www.garybed.co.uk/player_biographies/gedeon_elmer.htm |archivedate = April 7, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His first mission was to attack an airfield at [[Beaumont-le-Roger]], France, on March 23, 1944.

On April 20, 1944, Gedeon piloted one of 36 B-26's that left Boreham in the late afternoon to attack a [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1 &quot;buzz bomb&quot;]] site being constructed at [[Esquerdes]], a village in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] near [[Saint-Omer]].
