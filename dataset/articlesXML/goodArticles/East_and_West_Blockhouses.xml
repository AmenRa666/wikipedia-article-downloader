The '''East''' and '''West Blockhouses''' were [[Device Forts]] built by King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1539 to protect the harbour of [[Milford Haven]] in Wales. The two [[blockhouse]]s were positioned on either side of the [[Milford Haven Waterway]] in the villages of [[Angle, Pembrokeshire|Angle]] and [[Dale, Pembrokeshire|Dale]] respectively, overlooking the sea. The East Blockhouse was never completed, but the remains were reused as a defensive site in the [[Second World War]]. The West Blockhouse was described by contemporaries as forming a round tower with [[gunport]]s, but it was demolished when [[West Blockhouse Fort]] was built on the same site in the 19th century.

==Background==
The two blockhouses were built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the final years of the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and with France and the Empire in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1987|p=111}}; Hale, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1991|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1533, Henry broke with Pope [[Paul III]] to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], and remarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was the aunt of [[Charles V of Spain|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; An invasion of England now appeared certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Henry issued an order, called a &quot;device&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Walton|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards work began on the East Blockhouse in the village of [[Angle, Pembrokeshire|Angle]].&lt;ref name=Crane2012P2&gt;{{harvnb|Crane|2012|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angle overlooked the mouth of [[Milford Haven]] harbour in Pembrokeshire; another fortification, the West Blockhouse, was built just across the other side of the [[Milford Haven Waterway]] at [[Dale, Pembrokeshire|Dale]].&lt;ref name=Crane2012P2/&gt;

The East Blockhouse was constructed on a narrow headland {{convert|35|m}} above the sea; the Elizabethan historian [[George Owen of Henllys|George Owen]] described the building as having been intended to be a &quot;rounde turrett&quot;, and the physical remains in the 20th century comprised a {{convert|7.3|by|4.0|m}} stone building, with a stone enclosure to the north and a subsidiary building {{convert|15|m}} away from the main site on the south-east side.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crane|2012|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=42}}; {{cite web|url =http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/103035/details/EAST+BLOCKHOUSE%2C+ANGLE/|title=East Blockhouse, Angle|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|mode=cs2|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction work was never completed and by 1546 the walls had begun to collapse.&lt;ref name=Crane2012P2/&gt; According to Owen, the West Blockhouse was a round tower, {{convert|20|ft}} in diameter, with eight [[gunport]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After peace was achieved with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to the increasingly prosperous south-west side of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biddle|Hiller|Scott|Streeten|2001|p=40}}; {{harvnb|Pattison|2009|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions with Spain grew and invasion appeared likely in 1589, resulting in royal permission being given to reuse the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out.&lt;ref name=Crane2012P2/&gt; The fort continued to decay until the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Crane2012P2/&gt; With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, the East Blockhouse was adapted for use by the British military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/103035/details/EAST+BLOCKHOUSE%2C+ANGLE/|title=East Blockhouse, Angle|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|mode=cs2|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior was cleared out and a shed was built in one corner.&lt;ref name=CraneP4RoyalComm&gt;{{harvnb|Crane|2012|p=4}}; {{cite web|url =http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/103035/details/EAST+BLOCKHOUSE%2C+ANGLE/|title=East Blockhouse, Angle|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|mode=cs2|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slit trench was dug on the north side of the building, a [[rifle]] [[embrasure]] formed on the east side of the building, and a [[machine-gun]] position was dug out and protected with sandbags outside it.&lt;ref name=CraneP4RoyalComm/&gt;

[[Coastal erosion|Land erosion]] has damaged the East Blockhouse site; the north wall collapsed before 1975, and between 2010 and 2011 there was another major landslip.&lt;ref name=Crane2012P2/&gt; An archaeological survey of the blockhouse, funded by the Welsh heritage agency [[Cadw]], took place in 2011.&lt;ref name=Crane2012P2/&gt; The East Blockhouse is the only such defensive structure to survive in Wales and is protected under UK law as a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crane|2012|p=2}}; {{cite web|url =http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/103035/details/EAST+BLOCKHOUSE%2C+ANGLE/|title=East Blockhouse, Angle|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|mode=cs2|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West Blockhouse was demolished in the 19th century, when [[West Blockhouse Fort]] was built on the same site, and there are no visible remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/276037/details/WEST+BLOCKHOUSE+FORT/|title=West Blockhouse, Dale|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|mode=cs2|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
