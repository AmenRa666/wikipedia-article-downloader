'''Fighter Squadron''' was a flying unit of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in the early 1930s.  It operated [[Bristol Bulldog]] single-seat fighters.  Along with [[Seaplane Squadron RAAF|Seaplane Squadron]], Fighter Squadron was a component of [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]], based at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria. As well as participating in training exercises, Fighter Squadron was frequently employed for aerobatic displays and [[wikt:show the flag|flag-waving]] duties.

==History==
Although the first entry in Fighter Squadron records is dated 12&amp;nbsp;February 1934, the official history of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) between the wars refers to the unit as having been established for the specific purpose of operating Australia's eight [[Bristol Bulldog]] fighters, which began entering service in May 1930.&lt;ref name=Fighter&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother178&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; Fighter Squadron was one of two formations raised at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria, under the auspices of [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS), the other being [[Seaplane Squadron RAAF|Seaplane Squadron]], which operated [[Supermarine Southampton]]s among other types.&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother186&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS had been the first unit to be formed as part of the new Australian Air Force on 31&amp;nbsp;March 1921 (the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; was added in August that year).&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother41&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The single-seat Bulldogs were procured to give the RAAF a dedicated air defence capability following the retirement of the [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]] fighter in 1928.&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother188&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Although only a &quot;token&quot; combat force according to the official history, the Bulldogs represented the latest technology available and gave Fighter Squadron the aura of an elite formation.&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother178/&gt;&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother188/&gt;

[[File:Scherger - Fighter Squadron RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Flight Lieutenant Scherger refuels his Bulldog at Nhill, Victoria, on his way to compete in an aerial derby in Adelaide, October 1931|alt=A man refuels a single-engined biplane in a field using barrels on a horse-drawn cart]]
On 15&amp;nbsp;May 1930, barely two weeks after delivery, one of the Bulldogs crashed due to structural failure while performing an inverted loop; the pilot parachuted to safety, the first time an RAAF member had done so in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1931, Fighter Squadron began flight testing the prototype [[Wackett Warrigal]] general-purpose biplane; testing was still under way when the aircraft's undercarriage collapsed during landing, putting off its service trials until the following January.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 270–271&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as participating in training exercises, Fighter Squadron was often employed for aerobatic displays and [[wikt:show the flag|flag-waving]] duties.&lt;ref name=Fighter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 104, 405&lt;/ref&gt; The young Air Force was keen to show off its skills and equipment to the public, leading to regular participation in aerial pageants and races as far afield as [[Western Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]; this had the added benefit of providing exposure to a variety of conditions on long-distance flights, as pilots were required to fly their aircraft to and from displays in remote areas. The commanding officer of Fighter Squadron, [[Squadron Leader]] Johnny Summers, considered that it gave personnel &quot;most useful experience in the handling and maintenance of their aircraft under adverse conditions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 399–400&lt;/ref&gt; One of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS's leading instructors during the early 1930s, Flight Lieutenant [[Frederick Scherger]], was also a [[flight commander]] in Fighter Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 188–189, 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1931, during a flight to [[Adelaide]] to take part in an aero club pageant, Scherger had to land at [[Nhill]], Victoria, in strong winds; his Bulldog finished up on its nose but the damage was slight, allowing him to complete the journey and win his air race with a top speed of {{convert|160|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=7127594|title=A12-1 (Scherger 15/10/1931)|work=Bristol Bulldog A12 [Accidents]|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|accessdate=24 April 2015|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighter Squadron's public displays often involved mock [[dogfight]]s and simulated [[Dive bomber|dive bombing]], sometimes at night. On 12&amp;nbsp;February 1934, Summers, Scherger and another pilot demonstrated night-time combat tactics over the Exhibition Ground in [[Melbourne]], the sky being lit with searchlights.&lt;ref name=Fighter/&gt; In October and November that year, the Bulldogs took part in several aerial displays in Victoria to commemorate the visit of [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]].&lt;ref name=Fighter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Fighter Squadron aircraft escorted the Duke on his visit to [[Brisbane]] aboard [[HMAS Australia (D84)|HMAS ''Australia'']].&lt;ref name=Fighter/&gt; The Bulldogs were also occasionally detailed for meteorological and photographic survey work.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 380–382&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout their existence, Fighter and Seaplane Squadrons remained under the control of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS and were &quot;really little more than [[Flight (military unit)|flights]]&quot;, in the words of the official history.&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother127&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; Fighter Squadron was dissolved in December 1935 when its six surviving Bulldogs were re-designated as [[fighter-bomber]]s and transferred from Point Cook to nearby [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Laverton]], where they joined the [[Hawker Demon]]s of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother186/&gt;&lt;ref name=FTS38&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; During its service with Fighter Squadron, the Bulldog had been the only single-seat fighter in the RAAF's inventory, and no specialist fighter type took its place for the remainder of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 188–189, 471&lt;/ref&gt;
