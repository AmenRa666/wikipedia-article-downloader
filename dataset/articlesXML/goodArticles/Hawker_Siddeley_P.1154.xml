The '''Hawker Siddeley P.1154''' was a planned [[supersonic]] [[V/STOL|vertical/short take-off and landing]] (V/STOL) fighter aircraft designed by [[Hawker Siddeley|Hawker Siddeley Aviation]] (HSA). 

Developed alongside the subsonic and smaller [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127|Hawker Siddeley P.1127/Kestrel]], the P.1154 was derived from the P.1150. The P.1150 proposal did not meet [[NBMR-3|NATO Basic Military Requirement 3]] and, consequently, the P.1154 was born. This [[Mach number|Mach]] 2-capable aircraft retained [[plenum chamber]] burning previously designed for the P.1150. Although the technical winner of eleven submissions, follow-on testing and production for the P.1154 did not proceed as a result of political strife.

Meanwhile, Hawker Siddeley considered modifying the airframe for a joint specification for an aircraft by the RAF and Royal Navy. Between 1961 and 1965 the two services harmonised their specifications to preserve design commonality. However, the RAF's desired configuration was to take precedence over that of the Royal Navy's. A number of proposals were submitted&amp;nbsp;– at one stage, a twin-[[Rolls-Royce Spey|Spey]] design was considered, then rejected. Following the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]]'s coming to power the project was cancelled in 1965. The Royal Navy would acquire the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]], while the RAF continued to foster development of the P.1127&amp;nbsp;(RAF), leading to the successful [[Harrier Jump Jet]] family.

== Development ==

=== NATO requirements ===
In 1961, during the development of the V/STOL [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127|P.1127 and Kestrel]], HSA considered the feasibility of a supersonic V/STOL aircraft. This was influenced by a general perception at the time that supersonic aircraft held significantly more value than subsonic aircraft. Consequently, on 13&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;1961, HSA decided to conduct preliminary work on a supersonic P.1127 under the guidance of Ralph Hooper.{{sfn|Jenkins|1998|p=19}} The aircraft, designated ''P.1150'' and 50% larger than the P.1127, would employ [[plenum chamber]] burning (PCB)&amp;nbsp;– essentially an afterburner in the previously cold forward nozzles – in the engine.{{sfn|Jenkins|1998|p=19}}&lt;ref name=Wilson_p9&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was a [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus]] development named the ''[[Bristol Siddeley BS100|BS.100]]'', and had four swivelling exhaust nozzles. The front nozzles were equipped with PCB, which uses the same principle as an [[afterburner]], allowing the aircraft to theoretically reach speeds of Mach&amp;nbsp;1.7–2.{{sfn|Jenkins|1998|p=19}}&lt;ref name=buttler_119-120/&gt;

[[File:Mirage III V 01 Musee du Bourget P1020107.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Dassault Mirage IIIV]] was a rival design to the P.1154.|alt=Slightly-angled front view of jet aircraft on blue floor in museum. Two aircraft are in the background, one of which is suspended near the ceiling.]]

The design effort was initially undertaken to cater for NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 ([[NBMR-3]]), which was issued in August&amp;nbsp;1961.&lt;ref name=Jefford_12&gt;Jefford 2006 et al, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifications called for a supersonic V/STOL strike fighter with a [[combat radius]] of {{Convert|250|nmi|km|disp=flip}}. Cruise speed was to be Mach&amp;nbsp;0.92, with a dash speed of Mach&amp;nbsp;1.5. The aircraft, with a {{Convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on|disp=flip}} payload, had to be able to clear a {{Convert|50|ft|m|adj=on|disp=flip}} obstacle following a {{Convert|500|ft|m|adj=on|disp=flip}} takeoff roll.{{sfn|Jenkins|1998|p=19}}&lt;ref name=buttler_118/&gt; However, as requirement specifications changed, the aircraft was considered undersized; subsequent studies confirmed these fears, and so Bristol enlarged the original PCB engine and raised the exhaust heat to increase thrust to 146.8&amp;nbsp;kN (30,000&amp;nbsp;lbf).&lt;ref name=Wilson_p9&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_19&gt;Jenkins 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;  A new larger design emerged, initially named ''P.1150/3'' before being redesignated the ''P.1154''.&lt;ref name=buttler_118&gt;Buttler 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt;

NBMR.3 also attracted ten other contenders, among which was P.1154's principal competitor, the [[Dassault Mirage IIIV]]. This design employed a separate lift/thrust engine concept whereby eight Rolls-Royce engines would provide lift, with a single Turboméca Atar for thrust. The Mirage IIIV was supported by [[British Aircraft Corporation]].&lt;ref name=buttler_119/&gt; HSA submitted its design to NATO through the [[Ministry of Aviation]] (MoA) on 8&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;1962 and, in May that year, the P.1154 emerged as the winner in the competition for the NBMR.3 over the Mirage IIIV.&lt;ref name=buttler_119/&gt; The P.1154 was judged to be technically superior, however the Mirage was politically palatable due to the co-operative development and production across member nations. The project was terminated in 1965 after the French government subsequently withdrew following the selection of the P.1154 over the Dassault design.&lt;ref name=buttler_119/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jefford_12-13&gt;Jefford 2006 et al, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The Mirage IIIV had been rejected mainly because of its excessive complexity, using nine engines compared to the P.1154's single-engine approach.&lt;ref name=Jefford_19&gt;Jefford 2006 et al, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

=== RAF and Royal Navy requirements ===
On 6&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1961, before the design was submitted to NATO, it was decided that the P.1154 would be developed with the requirements for use by both the RAF and the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=buttler_118-119&gt;Buttler 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; In February&amp;nbsp;1962, the Royal Navy's [[Admiralty]] received the aircraft concept with great interest as the Royal Navy was seeking a new [[interceptor aircraft]] for their [[aircraft carrier]]s.&lt;ref name=buttler_119/&gt; As a single aircraft, the P.1154 would replace [[Hawker Hunter]]s of the RAF and the [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]s of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA). However, the services sought different characteristics in their aircraft – the RAF desired a single-seat fighter with secondary intercept capability, while the Royal Navy wanted a two-seat interceptor capable of secondary low-level strike capability.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_19/&gt;&lt;ref name =buttler_119&gt;Buttler 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although financially and politically committed to a joint requirement with the Royal Navy, the RAF's single-seat design took precedence over the two-seat version of the Royal Navy. However, RAF P.1154s would have to accommodate the Navy's large airborne intercept (AI) radar.&lt;ref name =buttler_119/&gt; When HSA submitted the design on 8&amp;nbsp;August, the Royal Navy criticised the proposal, which had a tandem undercarriage layout incompatible with [[Aircraft catapult#Steam catapult|catapult operations]]; consequently, a [[Tricycle gear|tricycle undercarriage]] design was investigated and accepted as practical.&lt;ref name =buttler_119/&gt;  In December that year, Rolls-Royce offered a PCB-equipped vectored thrust twin-[[Rolls-Royce Spey|Spey]] design as an alternative. This was seen as inferior, however, and was not considered in great detail. The aircraft required PCB for vertical takeoff, but this caused significant ground erosion.&lt;ref name=buttler_118-119/&gt; The aircraft would have been armed with the [[Red Top (missile)|Red Top]] missile.&lt;ref name=buttler_120/&gt;

With the RAF and Royal Navy requirements diverging, the aircraft's development started to stumble. While modifications towards naval requirements had been made, by July&amp;nbsp;1963 weight gain had become a considerable issue, and the Navy was openly criticising the choice of V/STOL.&lt;ref name=buttler_119/&gt; However, despite a stated Navy preference for a [[swing-wing]] fighter, on the 16&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;1963 the services agreed that the aircraft would be completely common, with the exception of different radar systems.&lt;ref name=buttler_119-120&gt;Buttler 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; By August&amp;nbsp;1963 Hawker Siddeley was expressing the view that range of changes made were damaging the aircraft's potential for export. At the same time, the Navy stated that it regarded the P.1154 as a second-rate interceptor, and the RAF openly decried the loss of strike performance.&lt;ref name=buttler_120/&gt; By October&amp;nbsp;1963, the MoA was concerned with the project's progress, and noted that the effort to combine a strike aircraft and a fighter in a single aircraft, and trying to fit that same airframe to both of the services, was &quot;unsound&quot;.&lt;ref name=buttler_120&gt;Buttler 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disfavour and cancellation ===
In November&amp;nbsp;1963, the RAF still found the P.1154 to be a suitable platform, while the Royal Navy appeared to consider the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] a better fit for its needs. In response, Hawker Siddeley focused its efforts on the RAF version.&lt;ref name=buttler_120/&gt; On 26&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;1964, it was announced in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by the Conservative government that a development contract had been placed for the P.1154, equipped with the BS.100 engine, as an RAF strike aircraft.&lt;ref name=buttler_121&gt;Buttler 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time it was announced that the Naval requirement would be met by Spey-engined Phantoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;wood223&quot;&gt;Wood 1975, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; More positive news emerged in 1964; on 30&amp;nbsp;October the BS.100 engine ran for the first time and Hawker Siddeley received favourable reports that the P.1154 was competitive with the performance of other aircraft, including the F-4 Phantom II.&lt;ref name=buttler_121/&gt;

[[File:F-4K XT595 NAN9-68.jpg|thumb|left|Following the P.1154 cancellation, the Royal Navy purchased the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in UK service|F-4 Phantom II]].|alt=Starboard black-and-white view of jet aircraft in-flight.]]

However, on 2&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;1965, the incoming [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]], led by [[Harold Wilson]], cancelled the P.1154 on the grounds of cost, along with several other aircraft such as the [[BAC TSR-2]] strike aircraft and [[Armstrong Whitworth AW.681|Hawker Siddeley HS.681]] VSTOL transport. At the time of cancellation, at least three prototypes were under construction.{{#tag:ref|Quote:&quot;At Hamble, work began in early January&amp;nbsp;1965 on jigging the first pair of wings; two more sets were underway by the end.&quot;&lt;ref name=buttler_121/&gt;|group=&quot;N&quot;}} Following the cancellation, the RAF and Royal Navy adopted the F-4 Phantom II instead, but the government also gave a contract for continued work on the P.1127&amp;nbsp;(RAF), which led to the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]]; this name had originally been reserved for the P.1154 should it enter service.&lt;ref name=buttler_121/&gt; In retrospect, aviation author Tony Buttler considered the cancellation of the aircraft to be justified, noting the time consuming and expensive failures of attempts by other nations (such as Soviet/Russia's [[Yakovlev Yak-141|Yak-41]] and West Germany's [[EWR VJ 101]]) at a supersonic VTOL aircraft.&lt;ref name=buttler_121/&gt; These aircraft all used a multiple engines configuration like the Mirage IIIV, and not the single vectored thrust turbofan of the likes of the BS.100 and Pegasus which went on to great success in the Harrier.
