'''Robert Duane Knapp, Jr.''' (December 26, 1897 &amp;ndash; April 25, 1994) was a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Air Force]] and an aviation pioneer. He held United States pilot license #185 and led the first [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aerial attack on [[Rome]] in [[World War II]]. Knapp received a [[Silver Star]] for leading an unescorted bombing raid on a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]-defended [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] [[convoy]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=USAFOH&gt;United States Air Force Office of History, ''[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/rdknapp.htm Robert Duane Knapp, Brigadier General, United States Air Force]'', retrieved March 8, 2008; &quot;321 Bombs Italy First&quot;, ''321 in the News'', July 19, 1943, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Robert D. Knapp was born in [[Moreland, Georgia|Moreland]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], but grew up in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]], [[Alabama]]. When Knapp was 10 years old, the [[Wright Brothers]] stayed in his home for a short time while consulting with professors at nearby [[Auburn University|Alabama Polytechnic Institute]], an event which shaped Knapp's future career.&lt;ref name=Auburn&gt;Auburn University, ''[http://www.eng.auburn.edu/programs/aero/about/history/early-years.html Aerospace Education and Research at Auburn University - From the Wright Brothers' Flight School to the Space Station]'', retrieved March 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
After completing his studies at [[Auburn High School (Alabama)|Auburn High School]] in 1917, Knapp applied for Army officer training, but was turned down due to his age. Instead, he was accepted as an [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps|aviation cadet]], receiving his [[Aircrew Badge|wings]] and being commissioned as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] on March 9, 1918. Knapp went to the [[United Kingdom]] with his unit, the [[92d Aero Squadron]] (Bombardment), in August 1918, but failed to see action in [[World War I]] due to a late shipment of propellers for his unit's [[Handley Page Type O|Handley Page O/400]] bombers.&lt;ref name=Auburn/&gt;

After returning from Europe, Knapp was assigned to the [[96th Aero Squadron]], charged with aerially patrolling the [[United States–Mexico border|US-Mexican border]] after a Mexican cross-border raid on [[El Paso, Texas]] in 1919. In 1921, he was given command of Flight &quot;A&quot; of [[12th Aero Squadron]] at Camp Stephen B. Little in [[Nogales, Arizona]], where for the next two years he patrolled the Arizona border. In 1923, he was transferred to [[Maxwell Field]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] for [[aerial mapping]] missions; while there, he flew the first [[air mail]] route between Montgomery and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. After four years at Maxwell, Knapp was assigned to [[Kelly Air Force Base|Kelly Field]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], where he was a flying instructor at the flight school. Having been promoted to [[commandant]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]] Primary Flying School at nearby [[Brooks City-Base|Brooks Field]] in 1929, he was appointed commanding officer of the 44th Observation Squadron in the [[Panama]] [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] in 1931. He later commanded the 7th Observation Squadron, also in Panama, before returning to Kelly Field in 1934 as Director of Flying Training.&lt;ref&gt;Air University, &quot;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/goe/eagle_bios/1988/knapp_1988.html Robert D. Knapp]&quot;, retrieved March 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Knapp in 1937 led a 98-aircraft squadron of Advanced Flying School students on a cross-country tour to recruit [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] cadets into aviation. In 1938, he attended [[Air Corps Tactical School]] and was an instructor for the 154th Observation Squadron of the [[Arkansas National Guard]]. He became the executive officer of the 1st Bomber Command at [[Langley Field]] near [[Hampton, Virginia]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAFOH&quot;/&gt;

===World War II===
After the United States entered [[World War II]] in 1941, Knapp organized six bombardier groups, trained three of them, and took command of one, the [[321st Air Expeditionary Wing|321st Bombardment Group]]. The 321st was assigned to [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], flying raids against [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces in [[B-25 Mitchell]] bombers. In July 1943, The 321st launched the first full-scale US bombing raid on an Axis capital with Knapp flying the lead plane in an attack on [[Rome]]. In 1944, he led an attack—without [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] escort—on an Axis shipping convoy that had fighter protection. For that attack, he was awarded a [[Silver Star]]. Later in 1944, he was promoted to [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]] and given command of the 57th Bomb Wing, a position he held for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAFOH&quot;/&gt;

==Later life==
After the war, Knapp became chief of the US Air Force Mission to [[Argentina]]. He retired from the Air Force in 1953, and returned home to Auburn, Alabama. Robert D. Knapp died in Alabama on April 25, 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAFOH&quot;/&gt;
