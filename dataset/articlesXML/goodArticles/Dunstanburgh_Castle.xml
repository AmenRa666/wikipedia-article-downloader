'''Dunstanburgh Castle''' is a 14th-century fortification on the coast of [[Northumberland]] in northern England, located between the villages of [[Craster]] and [[Embleton, Northumberland|Embleton]]. The castle was built by Earl [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas of Lancaster]] between 1313 and 1322, taking advantage of the site's natural defences and the existing earthworks of a former [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort|fort]]. Thomas was a leader of a [[baron]]ial faction opposed to King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and probably intended Dunstanburgh to act as a secure refuge, should the political situation in southern England deteriorate. The castle also served as a statement of the earl's wealth and influence, and would have invited comparisons with the neighbouring royal castle of [[Bamburgh Castle|Bamburgh]]. Thomas probably only visited his new castle once, before being captured at the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]] as he attempted to flee royal forces for the safety of Dunstanburgh. Thomas was executed, and the castle became the property of the [[The Crown|Crown]] before passing into the [[Duchy of Lancaster]].

Dunstanburgh's defences were expanded in the 1380s by [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], the [[Duke of Lancaster]], in the light of the threat from Scotland and the [[Peasants Revolt|peasant uprisings]] of 1381. The castle was maintained in the 15th century by the Crown, and formed a strategic northern stronghold in the region during the [[Wars of the Roses]], changing hands between the rival [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] and [[House of York|Yorkist]] factions several times. The fortress never recovered from the [[siege]]s of these campaigns, and by the 16th century the [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Warden of the Scottish Marches]] described it as having fallen into &quot;wonderfull great decaye&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair1955&quot;/&gt; As the Scottish border became more stable, the military utility of the castle steadily diminished, and King [[James I of England|James I]] finally sold the property off into private ownership in 1604. The Grey family owned it for several centuries; increasingly ruinous, it became a popular subject for artists, including [[Thomas Girtin]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]], and formed the basis for a poem by [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]] in 1808.

By the 1920s, the castle's then owner, Sir [[Arthur Sutherland]], could no longer afford to maintain the property, and he placed it into the guardianship of the state in 1930. When the [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939, measures were taken to defend the Northumberland coastline from a [[Operation Sea Lion|potential German invasion]]. The castle was used as an observation post and the site was refortified with [[trench]]es, [[barbed wire]], [[pillbox (military)|pill boxes]] and a [[mine field]]. The Dunstanburgh Castle [[golf course]] was built near the property in 1900, and expanded by Sutherland in 1922. In the 21st century the castle is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and run by [[English Heritage]]. The ruins are protected under UK law as a [[Grade I listed building]], and are part of a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], forming an important natural environment for birds and amphibians.

Dunstanburgh Castle was built in the centre of a designed medieval landscape, surrounded by three artificial lakes called [[Mere (lake)|meres]] covering a total of {{convert|4.25|hectare}}. The [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]s enclose {{convert|9.96|acre}}, making it the largest castle in Northumberland. The most prominent part of the castle is the Great Gatehouse, a massive three-storey fortification, considered by historians Alastair Oswald and Jeremy Ashbee to be &quot;one of the most imposing structures in any English castle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oswald 2011 5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple rectangular towers protect the walls, including the Lilburn Tower, which looks out towards Bamburgh Castle, and the Egyncleugh Tower, positioned above Queen Margaret's Cove. Three internal complexes of buildings, now ruined, supported the earl's household, the castle [[constable]]'s household and the running of the surrounding estates. A harbour was built to the south-east of the castle, of which only a stone [[quay]] survives.

==History==

===Prehistory - 13th century===
The site of Dunstanburgh Castle in north-east [[Northumberland]] was probably first occupied in [[Prehistoric Britain|prehistoric times]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[promontory fort]] with earthwork defences was built on the same location at the end of the Iron Age, possibly being occupied from the 3rd century BC into the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald25&quot;/&gt; By the 14th century, however, the defences had been long abandoned, and the land was being used for [[arable farming|arable crops]].&lt;ref name=&quot;english-heritage25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=25}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/dunstanburgh-castle/history-and-research/history/1-prehistory/ | title=Prehistory |mode=cs2 |accessdate=23 August 2014 | publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunstanburgh formed part of the [[barony]] of [[Embleton, Northumberland|Embleton]], a village that lay inland to the west, traditionally owned by the [[Earl of Lancaster|earls of Lancaster]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oswald 2006 17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins and the earliest appearance of the name &quot;Dunstanburgh&quot; are uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;english-heritage25&quot;/&gt; Versions of the name, &quot;Dunstanesburghe&quot; and &quot;Donstanburgh&quot; were in use by the time of the castle's construction, however, and Dunstanburgh may stem from a combination of the name of the local village of Dunstan, and the Old English word &quot;[[burh]]&quot;, meaning fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=17}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/dunstanburgh-castle/history-and-research/history/1-prehistory/ | title=Prehistory |mode=cs2 |accessdate=23 August 2014 | publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 14th century===

====Construction====

Dunstanburgh Castle was constructed by [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas]], the Earl of Lancaster, between 1313 and 1322.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=27, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas was an immensely powerful English [[baron]], the second richest man in England after the King, with major land holdings across the kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oswald 2006 17&quot;/&gt; He had a turbulent relationship with his cousin, King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and had been a ringleader in the capture and killing of Edward's [[royal favourite]], [[Piers Gaveston]], in 1312.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain exactly why Thomas decided to build Dunstanburgh.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald92&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was located on a strong defensive site, it was some distance from the local settlements and other strategic sites of value.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald92&quot;/&gt; Thomas held some lands in Northumberland, but they were insignificant in comparison to his other estates in [[the Midlands]] and [[Yorkshire]], and until 1313 he had paid them little attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=27}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/dunstanburgh-castle/history-and-research/research/ | title=Research on Dunstanburgh Castle|mode=cs2 |accessdate=23 August 2014 | publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following Gaveston's death, however, civil conflict in England rarely seemed far away, and it is currently believed that Thomas probably intended to create a secure retreat, a safe distance away from Edward's forces in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=76–79}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=93}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/dunstanburgh-castle/history-and-research/history/2-constructing-the-castle/ | title=Constructing the Castle at Dunstanburgh|mode=cs2 |accessdate=23 August 2014 | publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also probably hoped to erect a prominent status symbol, illustrating his wealth and authority, and challenging that of the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=93}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/dunstanburgh-castle/history-and-research/history/2-constructing-the-castle/ | title=Constructing the Castle at Dunstanburgh|mode=cs2 |accessdate=23 August 2014 | publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may perhaps also have hoped to create a planned town alongside the castle, possibly intending to relocate the population of Embleton there.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald33&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building work on the castle had commenced by May 1313, with labourers beginning to excavate the [[moat]] and starting to construct the castle buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the outer wall may have been built by workers from Embleton as part of their [[feudal]] dues to Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operations were overseen by a [[Stone mason|mason]], Master Elias, possibly Elias de Burton, who had been previously involved in the construction of [[Conwy Castle]] in [[North Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron, [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] coal and [[Scandinavia]]n wood was brought in for use in the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year £184 had been spent, and work continued for several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald18&quot;/&gt;{{refn|It is impossible to accurately compare 14th-century and modern prices or incomes. For comparison, £184 represents about a third of the yearly income of a typical nobleman such as [[Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton|Richard le Scrope]], whose lands brought in around £600 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Given-Wilson|1996|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} A [[licence to crenellate]] - a form of royal authorisation for a new castle -  was issued by Edward II in 1316, and a castle [[constable]] was appointed in 1319, charged with defending both the castle and the surrounding manors of Embleton and Stamford.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1322 the castle was probably complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald18&quot;/&gt;

The resulting castle was huge, protected on one side by the sea cliffs, with a stone [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]], a massive [[gatehouse]] and six towers around the outside. A harbour was built on the south side of the fortress, enabling access from the sea. Northumbria was a lawless region in this period, suffering from the activities of thieves and ''schavaldours'', a type of border brigand, many of whom were members of Edward II's household, and the harbour may have represented a safer way to reach the castle than land routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|2003|pp=115, 128}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loss====

Thomas of Lancaster made little use of his new castle; the only time he might have visited it was in 1319, when he was on his way north to join Edward's military campaign against Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald27&quot;/&gt; Civil war then broke out in 1321 between Edward and his enemies among the barons. After the initial royalist successes, Thomas fled the south of England for Dunstanburgh in 1322, but was intercepted on route by Sir [[Andrew Harclay]], resulting in the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]], in which Thomas was captured and then later executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oswald 2011 29&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The castle passed into royal control, and Edward considered it a useful fortress for protection against the threat from Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oswald 2011 29&quot;/&gt; Initially it was managed by Robert de Emeldon, a merchant from Newcastle, and protected by a garrison of 40 men at arms and 40 light horsemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=6}} for merchant bit&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Maduit, a politically rehabilitated former member of Thomas's army, was appointed as constable, followed by [[House of Lilburn|Sir John de Lilburn]], a Northumberland ''schavaldour'' in 1323, who was in turn replaced by Roger Heron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=30}}; {{harvnb|Cornell|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maduit and the castle's garrison took part in the [[Battle of Old Byland]] in 1322, and the garrison was subsequently increased to 130 men, predominantly light horsemen, and formed a key part of the northern defences against the Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cornell|2006|pp=8–9, 20–21, 260}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1326, the castle was given back to Thomas's brother, [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster|Henry of Lancaster]], with Lilburn returning as its constable, and continued to be of use in defence against the Scottish invasions over the next few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=27}}; {{harvnb|Cornell|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 14th century===
[[File:Dunstanburgh Castle - geograph.org.uk - 984.jpg|thumb|The remains of the Constable's house and complex of buildings (left) and the Constable's Tower (right)]]
Dunstanburgh Castle was acquired by [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]] through his marriage to Henry of Lancaster's granddaughter, [[Blanche of Lancaster|Blanche]], in 1362.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald30&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaunt was the younger brother of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] and, as the [[Duke of Lancaster]], was one of the wealthiest men of his generation. He became the Lieutenant of the Scottish Marches and visited his castle in 1380.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald30&quot;/&gt;

Dunstanburgh Castle was not a primary strategic target for Scottish attack, as it was positioned away from the main routes through the region, but it was kept well garrisoned during the Scottish wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding manor of Embleton had nonetheless suffered from Scottish raids and Gaunt had concerns over the condition of the castle's defences, ordering the building of additional fortifications around the gatehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=30}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the surrounding lands around the castle may have been brought into agricultural production at this time, either to feed a growing garrison, or to protect the crops against Scottish attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1381 the [[Peasants' Revolt]] broke out in England, during which Gaunt was targeted by the rebels as an especially hated member of the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=67, 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found himself stranded in the north of England in the early part of the revolt but considered Dunstanburgh insufficiently secure to function as a safe haven, and was forced to turn to [[Alnwick Castle]] instead, which refused to let him in, fearing that his presence would invite a rebel attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald30&quot;/&gt;

The experience encouraged Gaunt to further expand Dunstanburgh's defences over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=30, 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of work was carried out under the direction of the constable, Thomas of Ilderton, and the mason Henry of Holme, including blocking up the entrance in the gatehouse to turn it into a [[keep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=30, 32}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1384 a Scottish army attacked the castle but they lacked siege equipment and were unable to take the defences.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair8&quot;/&gt; Gaunt lost interest in the property after he gave up his role as the Lieutenant of the Marches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunstanburgh Castle remained part of the Duchy of Lancaster, but the Duchy was annexed to the Crown when Gaunt's son, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], took the throne of England in 1399.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===15th - 16th centuries===
[[File:Dunstanburgh Castle - geograph.org.uk - 924510.jpg|thumb|Lilburn Tower, seen from the edge of the outer bailey]]
The Scottish threat persisted, and in 1402 Dunstanburgh Castle's constable, probably accompanied by its garrison, took part in the [[Battle of Humbleton Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cornell|2006|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] inherited the throne in 1422 and during the next few decades, numerous repairs were undertaken to the property's buildings and outer defences, which had fallen into disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wars of the Roses]], a dynastic conflict between the rival houses of [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[House of York|York]], broke out in the middle of the 15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald33&quot;/&gt; The castle was initially held by the Lancastrians, and the castle's constable, Sir Ralph Babthorpe, died at the [[First Battle of St Albans|Battle of St Albans]] in 1455, fighting for the Lancastrian Henry VI.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The castle formed part of a sequence of fortifications protecting the eastern route into Scotland, and in 1461 King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] attempted to break the Lancastrian stranglehold on the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald33&quot;/&gt; Sir Ralph Percy, one of the joint constables, defended the castle until September 1461, when he surrendered it to the Yorkists.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald33&quot;/&gt; In 1462, Henry VI's wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]], invaded England with a French army, landing at [[Bamburgh]]; Percy then switched sides and declared himself for the Lancastrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dunstanburgh Castle and Whin Sill - geograph.org.uk - 109789.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Gull Crag cliffs and Lilburn Tower]]
Another Yorkist army was dispatched north in November under the joint command of the earls of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester|Worcester]], and Sir Ralph Grey.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald34&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; They besieged the castle, which surrendered that Christmas.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald34&quot;/&gt; Percy was left in charge of Dunstanburgh as part of Edward IV's attempts at reconciliation, but the next year he once again switched sides, returning the castle to the Lancastrians.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair10&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=10}}; {{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Percy died at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor in 1464, and the Earl of Warwick reoccupied the castle that June following a short siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair10&quot;/&gt;

The castle was probably damaged during the wars, but, other than minor repairs in 1470, nothing was spent on repairs and it fell into disrepair.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald1955&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=10}}; {{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a base for piracy in 1470, and by the 1520s its roof was robbed for lead for use at the [[Wark on Tweed Castle|castle at Wark-upon-Tweed]], and further lead and timber were taken for the moot hall in Embleton.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald1955&quot;/&gt; By 1538 it was described in a royal report to Henry VIII as &quot;a very ruinous house and of small strength&quot;, and it was observed that only the gatehouse was still habitable.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald34&quot;/&gt; Some repairs were carried out to the walls by Sir William Ellerker, the King's receiver, but a 1543 survey showed it to still be in poor condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair1955&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 20-foot (6 m) wide ditch was dug at the north end of the moat to prevent [[tank]]s from breaking through and following the track south past the castle, and a 545-foot by 151-foot (166 m by 46 m) wide [[Anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel]] [[minefield]] was laid to the south-west to prevent infantry soldiers from circumventing the castle's defences and advancing down into Craster.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=89–90}}; {{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war, the barbed wire was cleared away from the beaches by local Italian prisoners of war, although the two pillboxes, the remnants of the anti-tank ditch and some of the trenches and weapons pits still remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=87, 89–90}}; {{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|pp=56, 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunstanburgh Castle occupies a 68-acre (27.5 ha) site within a larger 610-acre (246 ha) body of National Trust land along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|pp=4, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle is situated on a prominent headland, part of the Great [[Whin Sill]] geological formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the south side of the castle there is a gentle slope across low-lying, boggy ground, but along the northern side, the Gull Crag cliffs form a natural barrier up to {{convert|30|m|adj=on}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cliffs are punctuated by various defiles, formed from weaknesses in the black [[basalt]] rock, including the famous Rumble Churn.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald4&quot;/&gt;

The landscape around the castle was carefully designed in the 14th century as a [[Deer park (England)|deer park]] or planned [[borough]], and would have looked similar to those at the contemporary castles of [[Framlingham Castle|Framlingham]], [[Kenilworth Castle|Kenilworth]], [[Leeds Castle|Leeds]] and [[Whittington Castle|Whittington]]; in particular, Kenilworth may have been a specific model for Dunstanburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=93, 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area around the castle was dominated by three shallow artificial lakes, called [[mere (lake)|mere]]s, and accessed by three gates on the north, west and south sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middleton 2009 44&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Earlier scholarship had suggested that the meres were originally salt water inlets, linked by the moat of the north mere, and connected to the sea at either end. The 2003 investigations at the site comprehensively disproved this theory, showing the meres to have always been fresh water lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=65, 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The meres were fed from a fresh water [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] 2,000 feet (600 m) inland, linked to the meres by an underground stone channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meres were originally bounded by a [[sod]]-cast boundary bank and ditch; today this is heavily eroded, and up to 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middleton 2009 44&quot;/&gt; The main route by land into the castle would have been from the village of Embleton, through the West Gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Mere is 5.6-acres (2.25 ha) large, and is blocked off on its northern end by a sod-cast bank, adjacent to the site of the North Gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern half takes the form of a 331-foot (101 m) long moat, which was recorded as being 18-foot (5.5 m) deep in the medieval period, terminating in the West Gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=43}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern part of this mere occasionally floods in the 21st century, creating a temporary lake, and the moated section usually still contains some standing water.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=22, 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Mere, covering 2.25-acres (1 ha), stretches away from the location of West Gate and is blocked at the far end by a small, stone [[dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=43}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three rectangular [[fish pond|fishponds]] were built alongside the West Mere, the smallest, probably a [[stew pond]] for raising young fish, being fed with water from the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|pp=43–44}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protective earthen bank, probably originally reinforced by a [[timber]] [[palisade]], ran for approximately 490 feet (150 m) along either side of the West Gate, where a gatehouse was probably built.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the far end of the lake complex was the South Mere, 2.25-acres (1 ha) in size, with the South Gate positioned in its eastern corner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middleton 2009 44&quot;/&gt;

A harbour was built south-east of the castle, which would originally have been used to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and it may not have been in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=12}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; West of the castle is a later [[shieling]], the earthwork remains of a [[longhouse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Middleton 2009 48&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middleton 2009 48&quot;/&gt;

The southern and western parts of the walls were originally faced with a local [[ashlar]] [[sandstone]] with a core of basalt rubble; the sandstone was mostly quarried at [[Howick, Northumberland|Howick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=5, 15–16, 19}}; {{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sandstone has since been stripped from the western parts of the wall, and the sandstone along the eastern end of the walls gives way to small [[limestone]] blocks, originally only laid 11-foot (3.3 m) high with a 4-foot 11 inches (1.5 m) parapet, but later raised in height with additional basalt boulders, probably during the Wars of the Roses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=5, 15–16, 19}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain if the curtain wall originally extended above the cliffs along the northern edge of the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|There are historical references in 1543 to a former wall running along the north side of the castle, but it was already being described as having been eroded by the sea many years before, and the assertion that it originally existed may not be authoritative. It is also uncertain whether this statement referred to a defensive curtain wall, of which no trace remains, or a simpler wall to protect livestock. Some erosion of the cliffs has occurred since the castle was first built, but little has occurred since 1861 and it is far from certain that sufficient erosion would have taken place to have destroyed any original walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

Moving counter-clockwise around the curtain wall from the north-west, the rectangular Lilburn Tower looks out across Embleton beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower was named after an early castle constable, John de Lilburn, but may have been built under Thomas of Lancaster; it was intended as a high-status residence, 59-foot (18 m) high, {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} square with {{convert|6|ft|adj=on}} thick walls, with a guardroom for soldiers on the ground floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rectangular towers at Dunstanburgh reflects the local tradition in Northumberland, and are similar to those at nearby Alnwick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/dunstanburgh-castle/history-and-research/significance/ | title=Significance of Dunstanburgh Castle|mode=cs2 |accessdate=23 August 2014 | publisher=English Heritage}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/dunstanburgh-castle/history-and-research/research/ | title=Research on Dunstanburgh Castle|mode=cs2 |accessdate=23 August 2014 | publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further along the wall there are the remains of a small tower, called Huggam's House by local tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earthworks around the inside of the curtain wall suggest that there may once have been a complex of buildings stretching between Lilburn Tower and Huggam's House.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald5&quot;/&gt;

On the south-west corner of the walls are the castle gatehouses. The most prominent of these is the Great Gatehouse, a massive three-storey fortification, comprising two drum-shaped towers of ashlar stone; originally 79-foot (24 m) high.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=5, 7, 10}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Goodall|2011|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was heavily influenced by the Edwardian gatehouses in North Wales, such as that at Harlech, but contains unique features, such as the frontal towers, and is considered by historians Alastair Oswald and Jeremy Ashbee to be &quot;one of the most imposing structures in any English castle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=5, 7}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/dunstanburgh-castle/history-and-research/significance/ | title=Significance of Dunstanburgh Castle|mode=cs2 |accessdate=23 August 2014 | publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1380s this gatehouse was further strengthened with a 31-foot (9.4 m) long barbican, of which only the rubble foundations now survive, around 2-foot 4 inches (0.7 m) high.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passageway through the gatehouse was protected by a [[portcullis]] and possibly a set of wooden gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground floor contained two guardrooms, each {{convert|21|ft|adj=on}} wide, and latrines, with [[spiral staircase]]s in the corner of the gatehouse running up to the first floor, where relatively well-lit chambers with fireplaces probably accommodated the garrison's officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=6–8}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staircases continued up to the second floor, containing the castle's great hall, an antechamber and bedchamber, originally intended for the use of Thomas of Lancaster and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four towers extended above the gatehouse's lead-covered roof for an additional two storeys of height, giving extensive views of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=5, 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design may have influenced the construction of Henry IV's gatehouse at Lancaster Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodall|2011|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plan of Dunstanburgh Castle gatehouse.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plan of the Great Gatehouse]]
Immediately to the west of the Great Gatehouse is John of Gaunt's Gatehouse, originally either two or three storeys tall, but now only surviving at the foundation level.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gatehouse replaced the Great Gatehouse as the main entrance, and would have contained a [[Porter (college)|porter]]'s lodge, defended by a combination of a portcullis and a 82-foot (25 m) long barbican.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; A inner bailey was approximately 50-foot by 75-foot (23 m by 15 m), defended by a 20-foot (6 m) high mantlet wall, was constructed in the 1380s behind John of Gaunt's Gatehouse and the Great Gatehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complex comprised a vaulted inner gatehouse, {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} square, and six buildings, including an [[antechamber]], kitchen and [[bakehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=20–21}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further along the south side of the walls is the Constable's Tower, a square tower containing comfortable accommodation for the castle's constable, including stone window seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the inside of the walls are the foundations of a [[hall]] and chamber, built before 1351, part of a larger complex of buildings used by the constable and his household, approximately {{convert|60|ft|adj=on}} square.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of the Constable's Tower is a small turret that projects from the upper wall - an unusual feature, similar to that at [[Pickering Castle]] - and a mural [[garderobe]]; and to the east a small oblong turret with a single chamber, 10.75-foot by 7.5-foot (3.28 m by 2.3 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|pp=20–21}}; {{harvnb|Goodall|2011|pp=249, 453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south-east corner of the walls, the Egyncleugh Tower - whose name means &quot;eagle's ravine&quot; in the Northumbrian dialect - overlooks Queen Margaret's Cove below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The Egyncleugh Tower was also called the Margaret Tower for a period, after Queen Margaret's Cove below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} A three storey, square building, {{convert|25|ft|adj=on}} across, Egyncleugh Tower was designed to house a castle official, and included a small gateway and drawbridge into the castle, either for the use of the castle constable, or possibly for the local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a postern gate in the eastern wall, added in the 1450s, and a further gateway in the north-eastern corner, which gave access to Castle Point and Gull Crag below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=15, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the inside of the curtain walls are the foundations of a yard, 200-foot by 100-foot (61 m by 30 m), and a large rectangular building, usually identified as a [[Monastic grange|grange]] or a [[barn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=16–17}}; {{harvnb|Blair|Honeyman|1955|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have probably supported the administration of the Embleton estates, and have included the auditor's chamber and other facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald96&quot;/&gt;

===Interpretation===
[[File:Dunstanburgh Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1716666.jpg|thumb|Dunstanburgh Castle, reflected in the remains of the southern mere]]
Early analysis of Dunstanburgh Castle focused on its qualities as a military, defensive site, but more recent work has emphasised the symbolic aspects of its design and the surrounding landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the castle was intended as a secure bolt-hole for Thomas of Lancaster should events go awry in the south of England, it was however &quot;clearly not an inconspicuous hiding place&quot;, as the English Heritage research team have pointed out: it was a spectacular construction, located in the centre of a huge, carefully designed medieval landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=93}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meres surrounding the castle would have reflected the castle walls and towers, turning the outcrop into a virtual island and producing what the historians Oswald and Ashbee have called &quot;an awe-inspiring and beautiful sight&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Middleton|Hardie|2009|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The different elements of the castle were also positioned for particular effect. Unusually, the huge Great Gatehouse faced south-east, away from the main road, hiding its extraordinary architectural features.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=13, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been because Thomas intended to establish a new settlement in front of it, but the gatehouse was also probably intended to be viewed from the harbour, where the most senior visitors were expected to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lilburn Tower was positioned so as to be clearly - and provocatively - visible to Edward II's castle at Bamburgh, 9 miles (15&amp;nbsp;km) away along the coast, and would have been elegantly framed by the entranceway to the Great Gatehouse for any visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also positioned on a set of natural basalt pillars, which - although inconvenient to build upon - would have enhanced its dramatic appearance and reflection in the meres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the castle may also have alluded to [[King Arthur|Arthurian mythology]], which were a popular set of ideals and beliefs among the English ruling classes at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas appears to have had an interest in the Arthurian legends, and used the pseudonym &quot;King Arthur&quot; in his correspondence with the Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunstanburgh, with an ancient fort at its centre encircled by water, may have been an allusion to Camelot, and in turn to Thomas's claim to political authority over the failing Edward II, and was also strikingly similar to contemporary depictions of Sir [[Lancelot of the Lake|Lancelot]]'s castle of &quot;[[Joyous Garde]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=93–94}}; {{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|2011|pp=23, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore==
[[File:Matthew Gregory Lewis by George Lethbridge Saunders, after Unknown artist.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]], author of the poem ''Sir Guy the Seeker'']]
Dunstanburgh Castle has closely associated with the legend of Sir Guy the Seeker since at least the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different versions of the story vary slightly in their details, but typically involve a [[knight]], Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] and led inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald21&quot;/&gt; There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a [[crystal]] tomb and guarded by a sleeping army.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald21&quot;/&gt; The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a [[hunting horn]] to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the sleeping knights.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald21&quot;/&gt; Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends the rest of his life attempting to find a way back inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald21&quot;/&gt;

It is unclear when the story first emerged, but similar stories, possibly inspired by medieval Arthurian legends, exist at the nearby locations of [[Hexham]] and the [[Eildon Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]] wrote a poem, ''Sir Guy the Seeker'', popularising the story in 1808, with subsequent versions produced by W. G. Thompson in 1821 and James Service in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale continues to be told as part of the local oral tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald21&quot;/&gt;

Several other oral traditions about the castle survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald2006&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these involves a child prisoner within the castle, who escaped, throwing the key to her dungeon into a nearby field, sometimes argued to be an outcrop of land north-west of the castle, which from then onwards was infertile.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald2006&quot;/&gt; Another centres on a man called Gallon who was left in charge of the castle by Margaret of Anjou and entrusted with a set of valuables; captured by the Yorkists, he escaped and later returned to reclaim six [[Venice|Venetian]] glasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald2006&quot;/&gt; The historian Katrina Porteous has noted that in the 14th century there are records of receivers and bailiffs at the castle called Galoun, potentially linked to the origins of the Gallon of this story.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald2006&quot;/&gt;

There are local stories of tunnels stretching from Dunstanburgh Castle to [[Craster Tower]], Embleton and [[Proctor Steads]], as well as a tunnel running from the castle well to the west of the castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;oswald2006&quot;/&gt; These stories may be linked to the presence of the drainage system around the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oswald|Ashbee|Porteous|Huntley|2006|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
