[[Air Commodore]] '''Peter Frank Raw''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (5 June 1922&amp;nbsp;– 14 July 1988) was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) pilot and officer. He joined the RAAF in 1941, and served as a flight instructor, bomber pilot and the commander of a communications unit during World War II. After the war he became a specialist navigator. Raw was appointed the commander of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Squadron]] in January 1953, but temporarily left this position for part of the year to participate in the [[1953 London to Christchurch air race]], in which he placed second. He returned to lead No. 2 Squadron at the end of 1953 and held this position until 1955.

Raw subsequently served in staff and diplomatic roles until 1965, when he took command of [[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No. 82 Wing]]. Between May 1966 and April 1967, he served as the air support coordinator for the Australian forces in South Vietnam; his initial refusal to commit RAAF helicopters to assist the [[Australian Army]] force that was heavily engaged during the [[Battle of Long Tan]] in August 1966 generated lasting controversy. Raw served in various staff and training positions until 1972, when he was appointed the commander of [[RMAF Butterworth|RAAF Base Butterworth]]. He returned to Australia in 1976 and retired from the RAAF two years later.

==Early career==

Raw was born in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Glen Huntly, Victoria|Glen Huntly]] on 5 June 1922 to Alfred and Eleanor Raw. He was educated at Tooronga Road State School and, later, [[Melbourne High School]].&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt; Raw began an electrical apprenticeship at [[Carlton &amp; United Breweries]] in 1939, and studied part-time at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]].&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_28&quot;&gt;Clark (2007), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Raw attempted to join the [[Royal Australian Navy]] as an electrical artificer in 1941, but was rejected and told to reapply in twelve months. Instead, he joined the RAAF on 15 August that year. He departed [[Sydney]] bound for [[Southern Rhodesia]] in November 1941 to be trained as a pilot under the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. Arriving in Southern Rhodesia in January 1942, Raw completed his training and was commissioned as an officer in December that year. He subsequently served as a flying instructor in Southern Rhodesia.&lt;ref name=Clark_28 /&gt; In May 1944 Raw became engaged to Dorothy Maggs, whose family lived in Southern Rhodesia and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11807820 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=24 May 1944 |accessdate=21 September 2014 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1944, Raw was transferred to Egypt and undertook an operational conversion course that prepared him to fly [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] heavy bombers in combat.&lt;ref name=Clark_28 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RCA&gt;{{cite news|title=RCA Radiogram|date=3 March 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July that year he was posted to [[No. 178 Squadron RAF]], a British B-24 Liberator unit based near [[Foggia]] in southern Italy.&lt;ref name=Clark_28 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=178 Squadron|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/178squadron.cfm|work=History RAF Formations|publisher=Royal Air Force|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While serving with this squadron, Raw took part in operations in the eastern Mediterranean region as well as Hungary, [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=Clark_28 /&gt; During August 1944 the long-range bomber units controlled by [[No. 205 Group RAF]], including No. 178 Squadron, undertook several risky operations as part of the [[Warsaw airlift]] to supply the Polish [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] during the [[Warsaw Uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;Herington (1963), pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; Raw participated in three of these flights.&lt;ref name=Clark_28 /&gt; His bomber was the only aircraft to deliver its cargo to Warsaw during a mission on 16&amp;nbsp;August; Raw subsequently received the Polish [[Cross of Valour (Poland)|Cross of Valour]] in February 1945 for this achievement.&lt;ref name=Clark_2012_5 /&gt; One of his other flights to Warsaw was conducted on 1&amp;nbsp;September, but Raw was unable to see the city at the time he dropped the load of supplies due to bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26042622 |title=Hard Going in Warsaw Mercy Flight |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=14 September 1944 |accessdate=12 June 2011 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a raid on the northern Italian city of [[Verona]] on 12 October 1944, Raw's aircraft was hit by two anti-aircraft shells that destroyed its hydraulics system and an engine, wounded the radio operator and opened 166 holes in the fuselage. Despite this damage, Raw was able to return the B-24 safely to its base. He suffered [[frostbite]] to his feet, as damage to the plane's nose caused icy winds to enter the [[cockpit]].&lt;ref name=Clark_28 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61943253 |title=With the RAAF over Europe|newspaper=[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] |location=Qld. |date=9 January 1945 |accessdate=12 June 2011 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1944, Raw was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]]. He assumed command of [[No. 205 Group Communication Squadron RAF|No. 205 Group Communication Squadron]] in 1945.&lt;ref name=Clark_28 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington  (1963), p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; In February that year he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref name=Clark_28 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honours and Awards – Peter Frank Raw|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=369166|work=Honours &amp; Awards|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the war, Raw returned to Australia in November 1945 and was demobilised on 17 January 1946.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark_28 /&gt; He married Maggs at St Mary's Church of England in Caulfield on the 19th of the month; they had a daughter.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt;

Raw rejoined the RAAF in May 1946, and retained his wartime rank of flight lieutenant. Between 1947 and October 1949 he was posted to Britain to undertake specialist training in navigation.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2007), pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Australia, Raw served as an instructor at the RAAF's [[School of Air Navigation RAAF|School of Air Navigation]], and later held training positions at [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No. 78 Wing]] and [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No. 2 Operational Training Unit]] (No. 2 OTU). During 1952 he served as the acting commanding officer of No. 2 OTU, which at the time was responsible for training pilots for combat in the [[Korean War]] with [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No. 77 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_29&quot;&gt;Clark (2007), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50517311 |title=Jet Pilots Undergo Intensive Training|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=7 July 1952 |accessdate=21 September 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commanding officer==

In January 1953 Raw, who was by now a [[squadron leader]], was appointed the commanding officer of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=Clark_29 /&gt; On 23 February he also became the initial commander of [[No. 1 Long Range Flight RAAF|No. 1 Long Range Flight]], which had been formed to participate in the [[1953 London to Christchurch air race]] using two of the RAAF's new [[English Electric Canberra]] bombers. He handed this position to Wing Commander [[Derek Cuming]] in May, but remained a member of the flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF_HS_148&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1953), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2876085 |title=R.A.A.F.

Raw returned to lead No. 2 Squadron on 18 December 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF_HS_13&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; During this month the unit became the RAAF's first jet bomber-equipped squadron when it replaced its [[Avro Lincoln]] aircraft with Canberras; in doing so the squadron was built around a nucleus of personnel who had served with No. 1 Long Range Flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF_HS_11&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52938567 |title=Air Race Crew Will Lead New Squadron. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=5 November 1953 |accessdate=13 June 2011 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in December a Canberra piloted by Raw established a new speed record for a flight between New Zealand and Australia, completing the crossing between [[Auckland]] and Sydney in two hours and 49 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51085425 |title=NZ-Aust flight breaks record. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=24 December 1953 |accessdate=12 June 2011 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31&amp;nbsp;December 1953 Raw was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] for his role in the London to Christchurch air race; the decoration was presented to him by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] at Brisbane on 10&amp;nbsp;March 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal honors&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47581066 |title=Mrs. Menzies, Airmen in Federal Honours List|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=1 January 1954 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18414101 |title=Queen's Busy 12-Hour Day|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=11 March 1954 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 1954 story in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' described Raw as being a &quot;shy young commander&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50621012 |title=Meet 'Barrier Busting' Berry... |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=17 September 1954 |accessdate=21 September 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his term as commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron on 11 July 1955, Raw was posted to the UK to undertake training at the [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell|Royal Air Force Flying College]].&lt;ref name=Clark_29 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_13 /&gt; Upon his return to Australia in January 1956, he was promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] and posted to a planning role at RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. From December that year he served as a liaison officer to the RAAF force supporting the British nuclear weapons tests in the [[Montebello Islands]] off the coast of Western Australia. In 1957 Raw was posted to the Joint Planning staff.&lt;ref name=Clark_29 /&gt; During 1958 he and Dorothy divorced; Raw subsequently married Helen Dorothy Hammond on 21 June that year at St Margaret's Presbyterian Church in [[Balaclava, Victoria|Balaclava]]. This marriage produced another daughter and a son.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt;

In December 1960 Raw joined the directing staff of the [[Australian Defence College|RAAF Staff College]] in Canberra. In 1963 he became the first president of the amateur Canberra Astronomical Society.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt; Later in 1963 he undertook further training at the United States [[Joint Forces Staff College|Armed Forces Staff College]], after which he assumed the position of assistant air attaché in the [[Embassy of Australia, Washington, D.C.|Australian Embassy]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=Clark_29 /&gt; In February 1965 Raw assumed command of [[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No. 82 Wing]], which controlled all of the RAAF's bomber squadrons. He was raised to acting [[group captain]] at this time, and was confirmed in this rank during January the next year.&lt;ref name=Clark_29 /&gt;

==Vietnam War and subsequent career==

In May 1966, Raw was posted to [[South Vietnam]] as the air support commander for the [[1st Australian Task Force]] (1 ATF). This force was composed primarily of Australian Army units, and had recently arrived in the country as part of an expansion of Australia's commitment to the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=Clark_29 /&gt; Although he did not have any background in air/land warfare, Raw's main responsibility in this position was to coordinate helicopter support for the task force's two infantry battalions.&lt;ref name=Clark_29 /&gt; He was given only two weeks to prepare for the role between handing over command of No. 82 Wing and departing for South Vietnam; during this period he received briefings on the situation in the country and began to familiarise himself with the operations of the RAAF's tactical transport units.&lt;ref name=&quot;McAulay_17&quot;&gt;McAulay (1987), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Alan Stephens has written that &quot;Group Captain Raw's background as one of the RAAF's most respected bomber leaders was inappropriate for the job of task force air commander: too often he struggled to make the timely decisions demanded by tactical air/land operations&quot;. Stephens has also stated that the RAAF's Air Board should have selected an officer with more relevant experience for the role.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens (1995), p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his responsibilities as air support commander, Raw was also the commander of the RAAF units stationed at [[Vũng Tàu]] and the overall deputy commander of the RAAF force in South Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_30&quot;&gt;Clark (2007), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; He regularly flew operational missions with the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopter-equipped [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] as well as [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|No. 35 Squadron]], which operated [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|DHC-4 Caribou]] tactical transports.&lt;ref name=Clark_30 /&gt;

At the time Raw arrived in South Vietnam there were tensions between the Army and RAAF over the employment of No. 9 Squadron, with the Army perceiving that the unit was not providing enough support to 1 ATF. Raw believed that the Task Force headquarters had unrealistic expectations as the Army officers did not understand the difficulty of maintaining and operating helicopters.&lt;ref name=&quot;McAulay_18&quot;&gt;McAulay (1987), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RAAF UH-1D of 9 Sqn in Vietnam 1970.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A No. 9 Squadron Iroquois helicopter in South Vietnam during 1970|alt=Black and white photograph of a helicopter flying at a low altitude]]

Raw's role in the [[Battle of Long Tan]] on 18 August 1966 was controversial. During the engagement, he initially refused to allow No. 9 Squadron to fly ammunition to D Company of the [[6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] after it was heavily engaged and nearly surrounded, as he believed that the heavy rain at the time made flying too dangerous. The commander of the 1st Australian Task Force, Brigadier [[Oliver David Jackson|David Jackson]], was angered by this decision and argued that the risk of losing a few helicopters was unimportant compared to the possibility of having 200 infantrymen killed if the unit was overrun due to a lack of ammunition and other supplies. Raw eventually allowed the resupply flight to proceed after the most experienced of the helicopter pilots present stated that the mission needed to be flown regardless of its risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens_1995_295-296&quot;&gt;Stephens (1995), pp. 295–296&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his actions during the Battle of Long Tan, the relationship between Raw and senior Army commanders in 1 ATF was &quot;most difficult&quot; throughout the remainder of his time in South Vietnam.&lt;ref name=Clark_30 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark (1995), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he eventually managed to educate the senior Army officers within the 1st Australian Task Force about the constraints which affected helicopter operations, leading to a better working relationship between the services.&lt;ref name=&quot;McAulay_20&quot;&gt;McAulay (1987), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1965 Raw took part in Operation Hayman, which was conducted against [[Viet Cong]] forces on [[Long Son Island]]. During this operation he flew in with the assault troops and remained on the island to direct air missions, including while under sniper fire.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2007), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Raw completed his tour of duty in South Vietnam in April 1967 and returned to Australia. In November that year he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his role in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_31&quot;&gt;Clark (2007), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The disagreement between Jackson and Raw during the Battle of Long Tan had long-term effects on the structure of the [[Australian Defence Force]]. Raw's initial refusal to commit helicopters contributed to the development of a long-lasting perception among some Army officers that the RAAF was reluctant to support their service in battle. Some members of the Army also wrongly believed that RAAF pilots had refused to conduct the supply mission, and only did so after the squadron was threatened with being withdrawn from South Vietnam and they were spoken to forcefully by Raw. Influenced by this perception, the Army subsequently advocated for the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to be transferred to its control, and this finally occurred in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=Stephens_1995_295-296 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McAulay_159&quot;&gt;McAulay (1987), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Australia, Raw was appointed Director of Operational Requirements at the [[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]].&lt;ref name=Clark_31 /&gt; In 1969 he headed an evaluation team tasked with selecting a heavy lift helicopter for the RAAF. The team was faced with a choice between the [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] and [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion]], and Raw's final report recommended acquiring CH-53s. The RAAF's governing Air Board and senior Army officers rejected this recommendation, and CH-47s [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook in Australian service|were purchased instead]] after Air Vice Marshal [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] also reviewed the performance of the two helicopters and concluded that the Chinook better met Australia's needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens_1995_433&quot;&gt;Stephens (1995), p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; Raw remained the Director of Operational Requirements until 1970 when he became the commandant of the [[Australian Defence College#History of College|RAAF Staff College]]. In 1972 he was promoted to [[air commodore]] and assumed command of [[RMAF Base Butterworth|RAAF Base Butterworth]] in Malaysia. Raw held this position until 1976 when he returned to Australia and became the senior training and staff officer in the headquarters of [[RAAF Support Command]].
