'''''Peyk-i Şevket''''' was a [[torpedo cruiser]] of the [[Ottoman Navy]], built in Germany in 1906–07, the [[lead ship]] of [[Peyk-i Şevket-class cruiser|her class]], which included one other vessel. She was built by the [[Germaniawerft]] shipyard in Germany in 1906–07, and was delivered to the Ottoman Navy in November 1907. The ship's primary armament consisted of three {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s and a pair of {{convert|105|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and she was capable of a top speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}. A major reconstruction in the late 1930s revised her armament and rebuilt her bow and superstructure.

The ship was interned at British-controlled [[Suez]] at the start of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911–12, and as a result she saw no action during the conflict. During the [[First Balkan War]] in 1913, she bombarded Bulgarian troops threatening the Ottoman capital at [[Constantinople]]. ''Peyk-i Şevket'' was torpedoed by the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|E11}} in August 1915 during the [[Dardanelles Campaign]] of [[World War I]]. Repairs lasted until 1917, and in the final year of the war she served in the [[Black Sea]], escorting troop ships to the [[Caucasus]]. Renamed '''''Peyk''''' in 1923, the ship continued in service with the [[Turkish Navy]] following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire until 1944, when she was decommissioned. She was broken up for scrap in 1953–54.

{{main|Peyk-i Şevket-class cruiser}}

''Peyk-i Şevket'', classified as a [[torpedo cruiser]] by the [[Ottoman Navy]],&lt;ref&gt;''Fleets of the World'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; was also sometimes referred to as a [[torpedo gunboat]]. She was {{convert|80|m|abbr=on}} long, with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.4|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|775|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}} while on [[sea trial]]s. The ship was powered by a pair of vertical [[triple-expansion engine]]s each driving a [[screw propeller]]. The engines were rated at {{convert|5100|ihp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}; ''Peyk-i Şevket'' had a cruising radius of {{convert|3240|nmi|lk=in}}. Her crew numbered 105&amp;nbsp;officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=GG392&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peyk-i Şevket''{{'}}s primary offensive armament was her three {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. One was mounted in the bow, above water, and the other two were in deck-mounted swivel launchers [[amidships]]. She was armed with a pair of {{convert|105|mm|abbr=on}} guns that were placed in shielded single mounts on the [[forecastle]] and [[quarterdeck]]. She also carried six {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} guns, four of which were mounted in [[sponson]]s, and a pair of {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} guns. She had no armor protection.&lt;ref name=GG392/&gt;

==Service history==

''Peyk-i Şevket'' was ordered on 18 January 1903 and laid down down in February 1906 at the [[Germaniawerft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]], Germany. She was launched on 15 November of that year, and completed in 1907. After completing sea trials, she was transferred to the Ottoman Navy, arriving in Constantinople on 13 November, where she was formally commissioned into the Ottoman fleet.&lt;ref name=LG149&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rauf Orbay]] took command of the ship in 1908, and held the position until 1911.&lt;ref name=LG25&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, she and her sister participated in the first fleet maneuver conducted by the Ottoman Navy in twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in September 1911, ''Peyk-i Şevket'' was in the [[Red Sea]]; on 2 October, she encountered the Italian torpedo cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Aretusa||2}} and the [[gunboat]] {{ship|Italian gunboat|Volturno||2}} off [[Al Hudaydah]]. The two Italian vessels forced ''Peyk-i Şevket'' to flee into the port, bombarded the dock facilities, and then withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peyk-i Şevket'' was later [[:wikt:intern#Verb|interned]] for the duration of the war in British-controlled [[Suez]].&lt;ref name=LG25/&gt; In March 1913 during the [[First Balkan War]], the ship was sent to the [[Black Sea]] to support the [[Çatalca]] garrison, which was under renewed attacks by the Bulgarian army during the [[Second Battle of Çatalca]]. After heavy bombardment from the Ottoman fleet, including ''Peyk-i Şevket'', the Bulgarians were forced to retreat on 30 March.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 1914, ''Peyk-i Şevket'' steamed to Constantinople, where she was scheduled to begin a lengthy overhaul. But due to the growing tensions in the region due to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in Europe, the ship was only painted and loaded with ammunition, fuel, and stores.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November, ''Peyk-i Şevket'' and the [[battlecruiser]] [[SMS Goeben|''Yavuz Sultan Selim'']], formerly the German ''Goeben'', for a patrol off the [[Bosporus]]. In December, the ship joined ''Yavuz Sultan Selim'', the ex-German [[light cruiser]] [[SMS Breslau|''Midilli'']], and her sister ''Berk-i Satvet'' to escort a convoy of four troop transports to [[Rize]].&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 1915, ''Peyk-i Şevket'' was nearly torpedoed by the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|E12}} in the [[Sea of Marmara]] while she was transporting ammunition to the Ottoman garrison at [[Çanakkale]]. Two months later, {{HMS|E11}} successfully torpedoed the ship on 6 August, causing serious damage.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship returned to service by 1917,&lt;ref name=LG149/&gt; and as of July 1918, the ship was back in service, being used as an escort for troopships between Constantinople and the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, pp. 54, 89&lt;/ref&gt; She was decommissioned in the final weeks of the war, on 30 October 1918, and laid up in Constantinople.&lt;ref name=LG149/&gt; On 30 November, the Ottoman Empire signed the [[Armistice of Mudros]] with the [[Triple Entente|Entente powers]], which concluded the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was renamed ''Peyk'' in 1923 following the end of the [[Turkish War of Independence]], which saw the [[Republic of Turkey]] replace the old [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=GG392/&gt; At the time, the ship was one of a handful of major warships still in active service, after more than a decade of near continuous war for the Turkish fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; From 1925 to 1927, she was modernized at the [[Gölcük Naval Shipyard]] and was recommissioned in 1927.&lt;ref name=LG149/&gt; She was rebuilt in 1936–38 and incorporated substantial improvements. Her [[Stem (ship)|stem]] was replaced and her [[superstructure]] was rebuilt. The old gun armament was replaced with a pair of {{convert|88|mm|abbr=on}} 45-[[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns and four 37&amp;nbsp;mm 40-caliber guns. The ship continued in service until 1944, when she was stricken from the [[naval register]].&lt;ref name=GG392/&gt; The ship was laid up in [[Izmit]] and broken up between 1953 and 1954 at the Gölcük shipyard.&lt;ref name=LG149/&gt;
