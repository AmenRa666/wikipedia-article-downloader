{{Campaignbox Normandy}}

The '''Falaise Pocket''' or '''Battle of the Falaise Pocket''' (12–21 August 1944) was the decisive engagement of the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. A [[pocket (military)|pocket]] was formed around [[Falaise, Calvados]], in which the German [[Army Group B]], with the [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]] and the [[5th Panzer Army (Germany)|Fifth Panzer Army]] (formerly {{lang|de|''Panzergruppe West''}}) were encircled by the [[Western Allies]]. The battle is also referred to as the Battle of the '''Falaise Gap''', after the corridor which the Germans sought to maintain to allow their escape and is sometimes referred to as the Chambois Pocket, the Falaise-Chambois Pocket, the Argentan–Falaise Pocket or the Trun–Chambois Gap. The battle resulted in the destruction of most of Army Group B west of the [[Seine]] river, which opened the way to Paris and the German border for the Allied armies.

Following [[Operation Cobra]], the American breakout from the Normandy [[beachhead]], rapid advances were made to the south and south-east by the [[Third United States Army|Third U.S. Army]] under the command of General [[George Patton]]. Despite lacking the resources to defeat the U.S. breakthrough and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives south of [[Caumont-l'Éventé|Caumont]] and [[Caen]], Field Marshal [[Günther von Kluge]], the commander of Army Group B, was not permitted by [[Adolf Hitler]] to withdraw but was ordered to conduct a counter-offensive at [[Mortain]] against the U.S. breakthrough. Four depleted [[panzer]] divisions were not enough to defeat the [[First United States Army|First U.S. Army]]. [[Operation Lüttich]] was a disaster, which drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.

On 8 August, the Allied ground forces commander, General [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], ordered the Allied armies to converge on the Falaise–Chambois area to envelop Army Group B, the First U.S. Army forming the southern arm, the British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] the base and the [[First Canadian Army]] the northern arm of the encirclement. The Germans began to withdraw on 17 August and on 19 August, the Allies linked up in Chambois. Gaps were forced in the Allied lines by German counter-attacks, the biggest being a corridor forced past the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armoured Division]] on Hill 262, a commanding position at the mouth of the pocket. By the evening of 21 August, the pocket had been sealed, with {{circa|50,000 Germans}} trapped inside. Many Germans escaped but losses in men and equipment were huge. Two days later the Allied [[Liberation of Paris]] was completed and on 30 August, the remnants of Army Group B retreated across the Seine, which ended [[Operation Overlord]].

==Background==

===Operation Overlord===
{{main|Operation Overlord}}

Early Allied objectives in the wake of the D-Day invasion of [[Nazi occupation of France|German-occupied France]], included the [[deep water port]] of [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] and the area surrounding the town of [[Caen]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Vat, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Allied attacks to expand the bridgehead had rapidly defeated the initial German attempts to destroy the invasion force but bad weather in the English Channel delayed the Allied build-up of supplies and reinforcements, while enabling the Germans to move troops and supplies with less interference from the Allied air forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams114&quot;&gt;Williams, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griess, pp. 308–310&lt;/ref&gt; Cherbourg was not captured by the VII U.S. Corps until 27 June and the German defence of Caen lasted until 20 July, when the southern districts were taken by the British and Canadians in [[Operation Goodwood]] and [[Operation Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trew, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], the Allied ground forces commander, had planned a strategy of attracting German forces to the east end of the bridgehead against the British and Canadian Second Army, while the [[First United States Army|First U.S. Army]] advanced down the west side of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] to [[Avranches]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July the First U.S. Army commander, Lieutenant-General [[Omar Bradley]] began [[Operation Cobra]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot, pp. 390–392&lt;/ref&gt; The First U.S. Army broke through the German defences near St. Lô and by the end of the third day had advanced {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of its start line at several points.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p.257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 July, Avranches was captured and within 24 hours the [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII U.S. Corps]] of the Third U.S. Army crossed the bridge at [[Pontaubault]] into Brittany and continued south and west through open country, almost without opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Lüttich===
{{Main|Operation Lüttich}}

The U.S. advance was swift and by 8 August, [[Le Mans]], the former headquarters of the German [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]], had been captured.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; After Operation Cobra, [[Operation Bluecoat]] and [[Operation Spring]], the German army in Normandy was so reduced that &quot;only a few SS fanatics still entertained hopes of avoiding defeat&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hastings277&gt;Hastings, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; On the Eastern Front, [[Operation Bagration]] had begun against [[Army Group Centre]] which left no possibility of reinforcement of the Western Front.&lt;ref name=Hastings277/&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] sent a directive to ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' Günther von Kluge, the replacement commander of [[Army Group B]] after the sacking of Rundstedt, ordering &quot;an immediate counter-attack between Mortain and Avranches&quot; to &quot;annihilate&quot; the enemy and make contact with the west coast of the Cotentin peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;D'Este, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams196&gt;Williams, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight of the nine [[Panzer division]]s in Normandy were to be used in the attack but only four could be made ready in time.&lt;ref name=Wilmot401&gt;Wilmot, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; The German commanders protested that their forces were incapable of an offensive but the warnings were ignored and [[Operation Lüttich]], commenced on 7 August around Mortain.&lt;ref name=Williams196/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; The first attacks were made by the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], {{lang|de|''[[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]]''}} and the {{lang|de|''[[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich]]''}} but they had only 75 [[Panzer IV]]s, 70 [[Panther tank|Panthers]] and 32 [[self-propelled gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies were forewarned by [[Ultra]] signals intercepts and although the offensive continued until 13 August the threat of Operation Lüttich had been ended within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;illustrated-ww2&quot;&gt;Messenger, pp. 213–217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 1979, pp. 112–119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Lüttich had led to the most powerful remaining German units being defeated at the west end of the Cotentin Peninsula by the First U.S. Army and the Normandy front on the verge of collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams197/&gt; Bradley said

{{quote|This is an opportunity that comes to a commander not more than once in a century. We're about to destroy an entire hostile army and go all the way from here to the German border.&lt;ref name= Williams197&gt;Williams, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Operation Totalize===
{{Main|Operation Totalize}}

[[Image:Totalise88gun.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A [[Cromwell tank]] and [[Willys MB]] jeep pass an abandoned German [[8.8 cm PaK 43|{{convert|88|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} PaK 43 anti-tank gun]] during Totalize&lt;/center&gt;]]
The First Canadian Army was ordered to capture high ground north of Falaise to trap Army Group B.&lt;ref&gt;D'Este, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadians planned [[Operation Totalize]], with attacks by strategic bombers and a novel night attack using [[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroo]] armoured personnel carriers.&lt;ref name=Hastings296&gt;Hastings, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuehlke, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Totalize began on the night of 7/8 August; the leading infantry rode on the Kangaroos, guided by electronic aids and illuminants, against the {{lang|de|''[[12th SS Panzer Division|12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]]''}}, which held a {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} front, supported by the [[101 SS Heavy Panzer Battalion|101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion]] and remnants of the 89th Infantry Division.&lt;ref name=Hastings296/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; [[Battle of Verrières Ridge|Verrières Ridge]] and [[Cintheaux]] were captured on 9 August but the speed of the advance was slowed by German resistance and some poor Canadian unit leadership, which led to many casualties in the [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division|4th Canadian Armoured Division]] and [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armoured Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hastings301/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bercuson 230&quot;&gt;Bercuson, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; By 10 August, Anglo-Canadian forces had reached Hill 195, north of Falaise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bercuson 230&quot;/&gt; The following day, Simonds relieved the armoured divisions with infantry divisions, ending the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==

===Allied plan===
Still expecting von Kluge to withdraw his forces from the tightening Allied noose, Montgomery had for some time been planning a &quot;long envelopment&quot;, by which the British and Canadians would pivot left from Falaise toward the River Seine while the U.S. Third Army blocked the escape route between the Seine and Loire rivers, trapping all surviving German forces in western France.&lt;ref name=Hastings353&gt;Hastings, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Divisions around the Falaise Pocket on 16 August 1944:[[First Canadian Army]], [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armoured Division]], [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division]], [[3rd Canadian Division|3rd Canadian Infantry Division]], [[4th Canadian Division|4th Canadian Armoured Division]]; [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second British Army]]: [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]], [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]], [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]], [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]], [[59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division]]; [[First United States Army]]: [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]], [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]], [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]], [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Division]], [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Infantry Division]]; [[Third United States Army]]: [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd French Armored Division]], [[90th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|90th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Copp (2003), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} In a telephone conversation on 8 August, the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], [[General (United_States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], recommended an American proposal for a shorter envelopment at [[Argentan]]. Montgomery and Patton had misgivings; if the Allies did not take Argentan, [[Alençon]] and Falaise quickly, many Germans might escape. Believing he could always fall back on the original plan if necessary, Montgomery accepted the wishes of Bradley as the man on the spot, and the proposal was adopted.&lt;ref name=Hastings353/&gt;

==Battle==

===Operation Tractable===
{{main|Operation Tractable}}

[[File:Operation Tractable.svg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The formation of the Falaise Pocket, from 8–17 August 1944&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Third Army advance from the south made good progress on 12 August; Alençon was captured and von Kluge was forced to commit troops he had been gathering for a counter-attack. Next day, the [[5th Armored Division (United States)|5th U.S. Armored Division]] of XV U.S. Corps, advanced {{convert|35|mi|km|abbr=on}} and reached positions overlooking Argentan.&lt;ref name=Wilmot417&gt;Wilmot, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August, Bradley over-ruled orders by Patton, for a further push northwards towards Falaise, by the 5th U.S. Armored Division.&lt;ref name=Wilmot417/&gt; Bradley ordered the XV U.S. Corps to &quot;concentrate for operations in another direction&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;Essame168&quot;&gt;Essame, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. troops near Argentan were ordered to withdraw, which ended the pincer movement by XV U.S. Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essame182&quot;&gt;Essame, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Patton objected but complied, which left an exit for the German forces in the Falaise Pocket.&lt;ref name= &quot;Essame182&quot;/&gt;{{refn|Bradley later received much blame for &quot;failing&quot; to exploit the opportunity to envelop Army Group B.&lt;ref name=Wilmot417/&gt; General [[Hans Speidel]], Chief of Staff of Army Group B, wrote that they would have been eliminated, if the 5th U.S. Armored Division had continued its advance to Falaise, although D'Este wrote that the order came from Montgomery.&lt;ref name= &quot;Essame182&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D'Este, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

With the Americans on the southern flank halted and then engaged with [[Panzer Group Eberbach]] and with the British pressing in from the north-west, the First Canadian Army, which included the [[Polish 1st Armoured Division]], was ordered to close the trap.&lt;ref name=Wilmot419&gt;Wilmot, p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; After a limited attack by the [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division]] down the Laize valley on 12–13 August, most of the time since Totalize had been spent preparing for [[Operation Tractable]] a set-piece attack on Falaise.&lt;ref name=Hastings301&gt;Hastings, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; The operation commenced on 14 August at 11:42, covered by an artillery [[smoke screen|smokescreen]] that mimicked the night attack of Operation Totalize.&lt;ref name=Hastings301/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bercuson231&gt;Bercuson, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th Canadian Armoured Division and the 1st Polish Armoured Division crossed the Laison but delays at the [[Dives River]] gave time for the Tiger tanks of the {{lang|de|''[[102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion|schwere SS-Panzer Abteilung 102]]''}} to counter-attack.&lt;ref name=Bercuson231/&gt;

Navigating through the smoke slowed progress and the mistaken use by the First Canadian Army of yellow smoke to identify their positions, when the strategic bombers used yellow to mark targets, led to some bombing of the Canadians and slower progress than planned.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hastings302&gt;Hastings, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August, the [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division]], [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division]] and the [[2nd Canadian (Armoured) Brigade]] continued the offensive but progress remained slow.&lt;ref name=Hastings302/&gt;&lt;ref name= vandervat169&gt;Van Der Vat, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th Armoured Division captured [[Soulangy]] against determined German resistance and several German counter-attacks, which prevented a breakthrough to [[Trun, Orne|Trun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bercuson 232&quot;&gt;Bercuson, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Next day, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division entered Falaise, against minor opposition from ''[[Waffen SS]]'' units and scattered pockets of German infantry and by 17 August, had secured the town.&lt;ref name=Copp104&gt;Copp (2006), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

At midday on the 16 August, von Kluge had refused an order from Hitler for another counter-attack and in the afternoon Hitler agreed to a withdrawal but became suspicious that von Kluge intended to surrender to the Allies.&lt;ref name=Hastings302/&gt;&lt;ref name= Wilmot420&gt;Wilmot, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Late on 17 August, Hitler sacked von Kluge and recalled him to Germany; von Kluge then either committed suicide or was killed by SS-officer [[Jürgen Stroop]] for his involvement in the bomb plot of [[July 20 plot|20 July]].&lt;ref name=Hastings303/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski, 1981, pp. 226–234&lt;/ref&gt; Von Kluge was succeeded by ''Feldmarshal'' [[Walter Model]], whose first act was to order the immediate retreat of the 7th Army and Fifth Panzer Army, while the ''[[II SS Panzer Corps]]'' with the remnants of four Panzer divisions, held the north face of the escape route against the British and Canadians and the ''[[XLVII Panzer Corps (Germany)|XLVII Panzer Corps]]'' with what was left of two Panzer divisions, held the southern face against the Third U.S. Army&lt;ref name=Hastings303/&gt;

===Encirclement===

[[File:Hill 262 20 Aug 1944.svg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;German counter-attacks against Canadian-Polish positions on 20 August 1944&lt;/center&gt;]]
By 17 August the encirclement was incomplete.&lt;ref name=Hastings303&gt;Hastings, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st Polish Armoured Division, part of the First Canadian Army, was divided into three battlegroups and ordered to make a wide sweep to the south-east, to meet American troops at Chambois.&lt;ref name=Hastings303/&gt; Trun fell to the 4th Canadian Armoured Division on 18 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zuehlke 169&quot;&gt;Zuehlke, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Having captured [[Champeaux, Manche|Champeaux]] on 19 August, the Polish battlegroups converged on Chambois and with reinforcements from the 4th Canadian Armoured Division, the Poles secured the town and linked up with the U.S. 90th and French [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd Armoured]] divisions  by evening.&lt;ref name=Wilmot422&gt;Wilmot, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Jarymowycz192&gt;Jarymowycz, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hastings304&gt;Hastings, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies were not yet astride the 7th Army escape route in any great strength and their positions were attacked by German troops inside the pocket.&lt;ref name=Hastings304/&gt; An armoured column of the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in [[Saint-Lambert, Calvados|St. Lambert]], took half the village and kept a road open for six hours until nightfall.&lt;ref name=Wilmot422/&gt; Many Germans escaped and small parties made their way through to the Dives during the night.&lt;ref name=Wilmot423&gt;Wilmot, p.423&lt;/ref&gt;

Having taken Chambois, two of the Polish battlegroups drove north-east and established themselves on part of [[Hill 262]] (Mont Ormel ridge), spending the night of 19 August digging in.&lt;ref name=&quot;deste 456&quot;&gt;D'Este, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; The following morning, Model ordered elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division and [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|9th SS Panzer Division]] to attack from outside the pocket towards the Polish positions.&lt;ref name= &quot;Jarymowycz195&quot;&gt;Jarymowycz, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Around midday, several units of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]], 12th SS Panzer Division and [[116th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|116th Panzer Division]] managed to break through the Polish lines and open a corridor, while the 9th SS Panzer Division, prevented the Canadians from intervening.&lt;ref name= &quot;Jarymowycz196&quot;&gt;Jarymowycz, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-afternoon, about 10,000 German troops had passed out of the pocket.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van-Der-Vat 168&quot;/&gt;

The Poles held on to Hill 262 (The Mace) and were able from their vantage point, to direct artillery fire on to the retreating Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Este 458&quot;&gt;D'Este, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;  Hausser the 7th Army commander, ordered that the Polish positions be &quot;eliminated&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van-Der-Vat 168&quot;&gt;Van Der Vat, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of the [[352nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|352nd Infantry Division]] and several battle groups from the 2nd SS Panzer Division, inflicted many casualties on the 8th and 9th battalions of the Polish Division but the assault was eventually repulsed at the cost of nearly all of their ammunition and the Poles watched as the remnants of the XLVII Panzer Corps escaped. During the night there was sporadic fighting and the Poles called for frequent artillery bombardments, to disrupt the German retreat from the sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Este 458&quot;/&gt;

[[File:St.-Lambert-surrender.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;German forces surrendering in St. Lambert on 19 August 1944&lt;/center&gt;]]
German attacks resumed the next morning but the Poles retained their foothold on the ridge. At about 11:00, a final attempt on the positions of the 9th Battalion was launched by nearby SS troops, which was defeated at close quarters.&lt;ref name=McGilvray54&gt;McGilvray, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after midday, the [[The Canadian Grenadier Guards|Canadian Grenadier Guards]] reached Mont Ormel and by late afternoon, the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the Seine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bercuson 232&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bercuson 233&quot;/&gt;  For the Falaise pocket operation, the 1st Polish Armoured Division listed 1,441 casualties including 466 killed &lt;ref name=Copp2003249&gt;Copp (2003), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; while Polish casualties at Mont Ormel were 351 killed and wounded, with eleven tanks lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilvray54&quot;/&gt; German losses in their assaults on the ridge were {{circa|500 dead}}  and 1,000 men taken prisoner, most from the 12th SS-Panzer Division. Scores of [[Tiger I|Tiger]], Panther and Panzer IV tanks were destroyed, along with many artillery pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilvray54&quot;/&gt;

By the evening of 21 August, tanks of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had linked with Polish forces at [[Coudehard]] and the 3rd and 4th Canadian Infantry divisions had secured St. Lambert and the northern passage to Chambois; the Falaise pocket had been sealed.&lt;ref name=Hastings313&gt;Hastings, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20–50,000 German troops minus heavy equipment, escaped through the gap and were reorganized and rearmed, in time to slow the Allied advance into the Netherlands and Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essame182&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B9627.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;German prisoners taken during the battle are given tea by their captors&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Battle of the Falaise Pocket ended the Battle of Normandy with a decisive German defeat.&lt;ref name=Williams204/&gt; Hitler's involvement had been damaging from the first, with his insistence on hopelessly unrealistic counter-offensives, micro-management of generals, and refusal to countenance withdrawal, when his armies were threatened with annihilation.&lt;ref name=Williams205&gt;Williams, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; More than forty German divisions were destroyed during the Battle of Normandy. No exact figures are available but historians estimate that the battle cost the German forces {{circa|450,000 men,}} of whom {{nowrap|240,000 were}} killed or wounded.&lt;ref name=Williams205/&gt; The Allies had achieved victory at a cost of {{nowrap|209,672 casualties}} among the ground forces, including {{nowrap|36,976 killed}} and {{nowrap|19,221 missing.}}&lt;ref name=Hastings313/&gt; The Allied air forces lost {{nowrap|16,714 airmen}} killed or missing in connection with Operation Overlord.&lt;ref&gt;Tamelander, Zetterling, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; The final battle of Operation Overlord, the [[Liberation of Paris]], followed on 25 August and Overlord ended by 30 August, with the retreat of the last German unit across the Seine.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;

The area in which the pocket had formed was full of the remains of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Villages had been destroyed and derelict equipment made some roads impassable. Corpses of soldiers and civilians littered the area along with thousands of dead cattle and horses.&lt;ref name=Lucas158&gt;Lucas &amp; Barker, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; In the hot August weather, maggots crawled over the bodies and hordes of flies descended on the area.&lt;ref name =Lucas158/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hastings312&gt;Hastings, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Pilots reported being able to smell the stench of the battlefield hundreds of feet above it.&lt;ref name=Lucas158/&gt; General Eisenhower recorded that;

{{Quotation|The battlefield at Falaise was unquestionably one of the greatest &quot;killing fields&quot; of any of the war areas. Forty-eight hours after the closing of the gap I was conducted through it on foot, to encounter scenes that could be described only by Dante. It was literally possible to walk for hundreds of yards at a time, stepping on nothing but dead and decaying flesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenhower|1948|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Eisenhower}}

Fear of infection from the rancid conditions led the Allies to declare the area an &quot;unhealthy zone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas &amp; Barker, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Clearing the area was a low priority though and went on until well into November. Many swollen bodies had to be shot to expunge gasses within them before they could be burnt and bulldozers were used to clear the area of dead animals.&lt;ref name=Lucas158/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hastings312/&gt;

Disappointed that a significant portion of the 7th Army had escaped from the pocket, many Allied commanders, particularly among the Americans, were critical of what they perceived as Montgomery's lack of urgency in closing the pocket.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilmot424&quot;/&gt; Writing shortly after the war, [[Ralph Ingersoll (PM publisher)|Ralph Ingersoll]]—a prominent peacetime journalist, who had served as a planner on Eisenhower's staff—expressed the prevailing American view at the time;

{{Quotation|The international army boundary arbitrarily divided the British and American battlefields just beyond Argentan, on the Falaise side of it. Patton's troops, who thought they had the mission of closing the gap, took Argentan in their stride and crossed the international boundary without stopping. Montgomery, who was still nominally in charge of all ground forces, now chose to exercise his authority and ordered Patton back to his side of the international boundary line. … For ten days, however, the beaten but still coherently organized German Army retreated through the Falaise gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ingersoll|1946|pp=190–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Ralph Ingersoll}}

Some historians have thought that the gap could have been closed earlier; Wilmot wrote that despite having British divisions in reserve, Montgomery did not reinforce Simonds and that the Canadian drive on Trun and Chambois was not &quot;vigorous and venturesome&quot; as the situation demanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilmot424&quot;/&gt; Hastings wrote that Montgomery, having witnessed what he called a poor Canadian performance during Totalize, should have brought up veteran British divisions to take the lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hastings353&quot;/&gt; D'Este and Blumenson wrote that Montgomery and Crerar might have done more to impart momentum to the British and Canadians. Patton's post-battle claim that the Americans could have prevented the German escape, had Bradley not ordered him to stop at Argentan, was &quot;absurd over-simplification&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hastings369&quot;&gt;Hastings, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chambois1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;General Eisenhower reviews damage (including a wrecked [[Tiger II]]) in the pocket at Chambois&lt;/center&gt;]]
Wilmot wrote that &quot;contrary to contemporary reports, the Americans did not capture Argentan until 20 August, the day after the link up at Chambois&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilmot425&quot;&gt;Wilmot, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; The American unit that closed the gap between Argentan and Chambois, the [[90th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|90th Division]], was according to Hastings, one of the least effective of any Allied army in Normandy. He speculated that the real reason Bradley halted Patton, was not fear of accidental clashes with the British but knowledge that, with powerful German formations still operational, the Americans lacked the means to defend an early blocking position and would have suffered an &quot;embarrassing and gratuitous setback&quot;, at the hands of the retreating ''[[Fallschirmjäger (Nazi Germany)|Fallschirmjäger]]'' and the 2nd and 12th ''SS-Panzer'' divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hastings369&quot;/&gt; Bradley wrote after the war that;

{{quotation|Although Patton might have spun a line across the narrow neck, I doubted his ability to hold it. Nineteen German divisions were now stampeding to escape the trap. Meanwhile, with four divisions George was already blocking three principal escape routes through Alencon, Sees and Argentan. Had he stretched that line to include Falaise, he would have extended his roadblock a distance of {{convert|40|mi|km}}. The enemy could not only have broken through, but he might have trampled Patton's position in the onrush. I much preferred a solid shoulder at Argentan to the possibility of a broken neck at Falaise.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;|Bradley}}

===Casualties===
By 22 August, all German forces west of the Allied lines were dead or in captivity.&lt;ref name= Hastings306&gt;Hastings, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; Historians differ in their estimates of German losses in the pocket. The majority state that from {{nowrap|80,000–100,000 troops}} were caught in the encirclement of whom {{nowrap|10,000–15,000 were}} killed, {{nowrap|40,000–50,000 were}} taken prisoner, and {{nowrap|20,000–50,000 escaped.}} Shulman, Wilmot and Ellis estimated that the remnants of {{nowrap|14–15 divisions}} were in the pocket. D'Este gave {{nowrap|80,000 troops}} trapped of whom {{nowrap|10,000 were killed,}} {{nowrap|50,000 captured}} and {{nowrap|20,000 escaped.}}&lt;ref&gt;D'Este, pp. 430–431&lt;/ref&gt; Shulman gives {{circa|80,000 trapped,}} {{nowrap|10–15,000 killed}} and {{nowrap|45,000 captured.}}&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, pp. 180, 184&lt;/ref&gt; Wilmot recorded {{nowrap|100,000 trapped,}} {{nowrap|10,000 killed}} and {{nowrap|50,000 captured.}}&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot, pp. 422, 424&lt;/ref&gt; Williams wrote that {{circa|100,000 German}} troops escaped.&lt;ref name=Williams204&gt;Williams, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Tamelander estimated that {{nowrap|50,000 German}} troops were caught of whom {{nowrap|10,000 were}} killed and {{nowrap|40,000 taken}} prisoner, while perhaps another {{nowrap|50,000 escaped.}}&lt;ref&gt;Tamelander, Zetterling, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern sector, German losses included {{nowrap|344 tanks,}} self-propelled guns and other light armoured vehicles, as well {{nowrap|as 2,447}} [[soft-skinned vehicle]]s and {{nowrap|252 guns}} abandoned or destroyed.&lt;ref name=Hastings313/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In the fighting around Hill 262, German losses totalled {{nowrap|2,000 men}} killed, {{nowrap|5,000 taken}} prisoner and {{nowrap|55 tanks,}} {{nowrap|44 guns}} and {{nowrap|152 other}} armoured vehicles destroyed.&lt;ref name=mcgilvray55&gt;McGilvray, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th SS-Panzer Division had lost {{nowrap|94 percent of}} its armour, nearly all of its artillery and {{nowrap|70 percent of}} its vehicles. With close to {{nowrap|20,000 men}} and {{nowrap|150 tanks}} before the Normandy campaign, after Falaise it was reduced to {{nowrap|300 men}} and {{nowrap|10 tanks.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bercuson 233&quot;&gt;Bercuson, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Although elements of several German formations had managed to escape to the east, even these had left behind most of their equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle, Allied investigators estimated that the Germans lost around {{nowrap|500 tanks}} and assault guns in the pocket and that little of the extricated equipment survived the retreat across the Seine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilmot424&quot;&gt;Wilmot, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;
