Lieutenant '''Fitz Henry Babbitt''' (10 October 1790 – 15 January 1815) was an officer of the United States Navy who served during the [[War of 1812]], and was killed during the [[Capture of USS President|capture of USS ''President'']].

==Biography==
Babbitt was probably born in [[Brookfield, Massachusetts]], and was appointed a [[midshipman]] in the Navy on 2 April 1804. He accepted his warrant on 28 May 1804 and entered into service on board the 32-gun frigate {{USS|Essex|1799|2}}, that same day. He served in ''Essex'' and in the [[bomb ketch]] {{USS|Spitfire|1803|2}} in the Mediterranean Sea between 1804 and 1806. Returning home to the United States in ''Spitfire'' in August 1806, Babbitt joined the frigate {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|2}} in 1807 and had charge of her [[quarterdeck]] guns on the [[Chesapeake–Leopard Affair|occasion of the battle]] with {{HMS|Leopard|1790|6}} on 22 June 1807. He was appointed an acting lieutenant and ordered to the [[brig]] {{USS|Argus|1803|2}} on 1 February 1810. He cruised the waters along the east coast of the United States in ''Argus'' until late October, at which time he was [[furlough]]ed. Babbitt received his lieutenant's [[Commission (document)|commission]] on 4 March 1811, with [[seniority]] to date from 5 June 1810.

On 19 February 1812, he received orders to join {{USS|Nautilus|1799|2}} and served in her until 17 July 1812 when a British squadron – built around the 64-gun ship-of-the-line {{HMS|Africa|1781|6}} and the frigates {{HMS|Shannon|1806|2}} and {{HMS|Aeolus|1801|2}} – captured ''Nautilus'' off the northern New Jersey coast. Babbitt spent several weeks as a prisoner of war in [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], before [[Prisoner exchange|being exchanged]]. Following his return, he was assigned to the frigate {{USS|Adams|1799|2}} on 30 November 1812 and helped in the futile effort to get that ship ready for sea after her modification into a sloop of war. Though the work was completed by the end of 1812, the British had ''Adams'' blockaded in [[Chesapeake Bay]] by then, and she remained so until early in 1814. Babbitt's assignment to ''Adams'', however, lasted only until the spring of 1813. On 6 April 1813, he received orders to join the frigate {{USS|United States|1797|2}}; but those orders were apparently changed later in the month, and he went to [[Sackett's Harbor]] along with the officers and men of the blockaded ''Adams''. In September 1813, Babbitt again received orders to ''United States'' to serve as that ship's first lieutenant. ''United States'', however, languished at [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] – along with her recent prize, {{HMS|Macedonian}}, by then also in American service, and the sloop of war {{USS|Hornet|1805 brig|2}} – under a blockade imposed by a powerful British squadron.

In the spring of 1814, the frigate's commanding officer, Captain [[Stephen Decatur]], received a posting to command the 44-gun frigate {{USS|President|1800|2}}, and took the crew of ''United States'' with him to man his new command. Thus, Babbitt came to be ''President''{{'}}s first lieutenant. Once again, Babbitt found himself assigned to a warship unable to get to sea because of a strong blockade. The frigate remained hemmed in at New York for the rest of 1814. Not until January 1815 did conditions allow ''President'' to attempt her escape to sea. Though the [[Treaty of Ghent|peace treaty]] had been signed in Ghent, Belgium, in December 1814, word had not reached the Americas, and hostilities continued in the western hemisphere for some weeks. Thus, when ''President'' made her move for the open sea, British warships stood ready to engage her. In her breakout attempt on 14 January 1815, ''President'' ran afoul of another squadron of British ships comprising {{HMS|Endymion|1797|6}}, {{HMS|Majestic|1785|2}}, {{HMS|Pomone|1809|2}} and {{HMS|Tenedos|1812|2}}.

During the ensuing fight, ''President'' managed to inflict sufficient damage on HMS ''Endymion'' to force her out of the struggle, but the unequal contest exacted a greater toll from the American ship. Unable to outrun her other adversaries because of hull damage sustained during a grounding soon after sailing, ''President'' finally succumbed to the combined attention of the three remaining British ships after a six-hour exchange in which she lost 24 of her crewmen and three of her lieutenants, including Babbitt.

==Namesake==
The destroyer {{USS|Babbitt|DD-128}} (1919–1946) was named for him.
