'''Ernest R. Emerson''' (born March 7, 1955) is an American custom [[Knifemaking|knifemaker]], [[Martial arts|martial artist]], and edged-weapons expert.  Originally an engineer and machinist in the [[aerospace]] industry,&lt;ref name=&quot;pickles&quot;/&gt; Emerson became a knifemaker by producing knives for a martial arts class and making art knives early in his knifemaking career.  In the 1980s he became better known for his combat knives and popularizing a style of knife known as the Tactical-folder.&lt;ref name=&quot;herndon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lang&quot;/&gt;

In order to secure military contracts, Emerson eventually founded [[Emerson Knives|Emerson Knives, Inc]] a production company to mass-produce his designs in 1996.  Emerson's knives have been displayed as museum pieces, designed for use by [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]]&lt;ref name=&quot;tieves&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SEALS&quot;/&gt; and used by [[NASA]] in outer space.&lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2002a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trzaska&gt;{{harvnb|Trzaska|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson's knives have been featured in films and novels, due to their association with military units.  This has furthered their popularity with [[Knife collecting|collectors]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcinko3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marcinko|Weisman|1994|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson is an accomplished martial artist who has developed a [[combatives]] system, [[Emerson Combat Systems]], which has been taught to police officers, [[United States Special Operations Forces|military units]], and civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;guzy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;waterman&quot;/&gt;

==Background==
Ernest Emerson was born on March 7, 1955 in northern [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=combs36&gt;{{harvnb|Combs|2004|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;barlow&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2003|pp=54–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending high school he displayed athletic ability as a wrestler and baseball player, being drafted by the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] to play professional baseball at the age of 17 in the [[Midwest League]].&lt;ref name=combs36/&gt;

Emerson began his training in martial arts at the age of 16 with the Korean version of [[Judo]] known as Yudo, traveling from Wisconsin to [[Minnesota]] twice a week to attend school.&lt;ref name=&quot;herndon&quot;/&gt; He continued his study of the martial arts while attending the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]] where he earned a brown belt in [[Kyokushinkai]] [[Karate]] and a [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[Shotokan Karate]] while competing on the university's karate team.&lt;ref name=combs36/&gt; After graduating with degrees in physical education and world history, Emerson moved to [[Southern California]] for the sole purpose of continuing his martial arts training at the Filipino Kali Academy.&lt;ref name=combs36/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imb&quot;/&gt; There he studied Jun Fan Gung Fu, [[Jeet Kune Do]], and [[Eskrima]] under the tutelage of [[Dan Inosanto]] and [[Richard Bustillo]] (both protégés of the late [[Bruce Lee]]).&lt;ref name=combs36/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imb&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2006e}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emerson subsequently trained in [[Gracie Jiu Jitsu]] for three years at the original Gracie Academy in [[Torrance, California]], under the founders of the Gracie Jiu Jitsu system, Rorion and [[Royce Gracie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Norman|1995|pp=104–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Emerson became an instructor in his own right and combined the principles of all these systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;BladeU&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|1998|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Southern California where he met his wife, Mary, who at the time was one of the world's top female practitioners of [[Jujutsu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tieves&quot;/&gt; During this time, Emerson worked as a technician, a machine operator, and eventually a design engineer for [[Hughes Aircraft]] in [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pickles&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pickles|1995|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=combs37&gt;{{harvnb|Combs|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early knifemaking==
[[File:The first Balisong knife made by Ernest Emerson.jpg|thumb|alt=A butterfly knife with steel handles and lightening holes.| Emerson's first handmade balisong knife]]

Although Emerson credits his grandfather's gift of a [[Barlow knife]] to him at the age of eight years with starting his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them.&lt;ref name=&quot;barlow&quot;/&gt; The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a [[Balisong (knife)|balisong knife]] for his study of a [[Filipino martial art]] and, unable to afford one on his salary,&lt;ref name=&quot;herndon&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Herndon|2000|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead.&lt;ref name=combs37/&gt; He [[mill (grinding)|milled]] and drilled the handles from [[aluminium|aluminum]] stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a [[hacksaw]], shaped with [[file (tool)|files]], and heat treated at his dining room table with a [[butane]] torch.&lt;ref name=combs37/&gt;

When he started classes with this &quot;homemade&quot; knife, his instructors and fellow students were impressed with his handiwork and asked him to make knives for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;tieves&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Tieves|1998|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson did so and sold these early [[butterfly knife|butterfly knives]] for just the cost of materials, but he soon raised the price to $50 each, as demand for his knives increased.&lt;ref name=combs37/&gt; Emerson went on to make fixed-blade knives on a part-time basis, but upon seeing a [[Michael Walker (knifemaker)|Michael Walker]] handmade folding knife at a gun show, he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided he was going to make folding [[pocket knife|pocketknives]] from that point on.&lt;ref name=&quot;herndon&quot;/&gt; Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the [[Walker Linerlock]] mechanism on his own knives.&lt;ref name=&quot;herndon&quot;/&gt;  According to a 1990 article by Paul Basch, Emerson said of Walker, &quot;Here was a guy who put everything I was looking for into a knife. It was then I decided to start making knives seriously and locking liners in particular&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;basch&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Basch|1990|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-tactical models==
[[File:Emerson PreTac knives.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An assortment of knives with anodized titanium bolsters in bright colors|Pre-Tac Folders]]

Emerson's early folding knives were of the [[Walker Linerlock|linerlock]] variety, ground by the [[stock removal]] method, and utilized rare materials from the [[aerospace]] industry, including [[titanium]], [[carbon fiber]], [[micarta]], and [[meteorite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;edge&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Covert|1998|pp=70–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He incorporated exotic materials common to knifemakers of the time, including [[nacre|mother-of-pearl]], [[abalone]] shell, [[paua]] shell, staghorn, and rare hardwoods.&lt;ref name=&quot;lang&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|1997|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Paul Basch reported in 1990 that Emerson refused to use the parts of any animal or plant which was an [[endangered species]], noting Emerson as being an environmentally conscious knifemaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;basch&quot;/&gt; The steel used in these blades was typically [[AISI steel grades|graded]] ATS-34, AEB-L, or 440C, and the blades were either highly polished or hand-rubbed. Emerson made knives with [[Damascus steel]] blades.&lt;ref name=&quot;basch&quot;/&gt; Among custom knife collectors and purveyors today, these knives are known as the &quot;Pre-Tac&quot; (Pre-Tactical) models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt; They can be identified by their bright [[anodising|anodized]] titanium bolsters and liners and the predominant use of clip point blades.&lt;ref name=&quot;basch&quot;/&gt; The knives were noted for their close tolerances and precise locking mechanisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt; Emerson credits the following knifemakers for helping him along during his early years as a knifemaker: [[Michael Walker (knifemaker)|Michael Walker]], Clint Breshears, Bob Engnath, and Jim Ferguson.&lt;ref name=&quot;basch&quot;/&gt;

Emerson's first logo or stamp on these knives was &quot;Emerson Knives&quot; surrounding the outline of a [[Bowie knife]]; accordingly this is referred to as the rare &quot;Bowie Logo&quot;, appearing on only a very small number of knives. When a knife collector asked Emerson if he made Bowie knives, Emerson informed him that he did not. The collector then advised him to change his logo or he might confuse the knife-buying public, as they would ask for Bowie knives instead of linerlock folders. Emerson agreed with this assessment, dropping the knife outline and the word &quot;knives&quot; from his stamp, using just his name in a half-circle on the blade as a logo. This marking is known among collectors as the &quot;Half-Moon Logo&quot; and would appear again as a transitional mark between the Viper and Specwar lines of knives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt;

These early knives sold for between $800 and $2,000 each; that, combined with his appearances at knife shows and write-ups in knife magazines, helped Emerson gain status and credibility as a custom knifemaker.&lt;ref name=tieves42&gt;{{harvnb|Tieves|1998|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once established as a serious and reputable maker, Emerson was soon able to concentrate on making the knives he wanted to make—knives designed for use as opposed to show, specifically folding-knives designed for combat.&lt;ref name=tieves42/&gt;

==Viper Knives==
[[File:Three &quot;Viper&quot; knives.jpg|thumb|alt=3 folding fighting knives with micarta handles and titanium bolsters| Viper Knives: MV-5, MV-3, and MV-1]]

As a direct result of watching his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat.&lt;ref name=tieves42/&gt; Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost,&lt;ref name=&quot;basch&quot;/&gt; in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials.&lt;ref name=combs39&gt;{{harvnb|Combs|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt; He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt; The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;profile&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|1996|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson ground the blades of these knives from ATS-34 steel with a [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell hardness]] of 57–59 and made them thicker toward the tip, creating a stronger-tipped blade than he had made previously.&lt;ref name=tieves42/&gt; He bead-blasted the blades as he did the liners and bolsters instead of rubbing or polishing them, giving them a matte finish as opposed to the mirror-polished finish common on his earlier knives and other knives at the time.&lt;ref name=combs39/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;walker&quot;/&gt;  Emerson designed each one of these knives for a specific purpose. The slender Viper 1 and smaller Viper 2 were designed for use as a police officer's backup weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt;  The Viper 5 was designed to be used by naval boat crews, as the handle was contoured with a rear brake so as to not slip from the user's hand when wet and the Viper 3 was designed as a pure fighting knife with its 4-inch blade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt;

Emerson's goal for this Viper line was to produce a working knife which would be more resistant to the elements and more durable than the &quot;art knives&quot; for which he had become known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tieves42/&gt; These knives were created to satisfy the demand for a practical field-grade combat knife which could be carried discreetly and accessed quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;garrett&quot;/&gt; He sold these five models under the name &quot;Viper Knives&quot; and changed the logo on the blades to read the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;garrett&quot;/&gt;  Emerson makes these models on a custom basis under the names MV1–5, &quot;MV&quot; standing for &quot;Model Viper&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;walker&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1993|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specwar Knives==
[[File:5 versions of the CQC-6 knife.jpg|thumb|alt=Five tanto-bladed folding knives showing subtle differences in blade geometry. |Five variants of the CQC-6; the top knife is a Super Sized version and with the knife below features the Wave.]]

In 1986 individual [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] from a West Coast team had been using personally purchased custom fixed-blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker [[Phill Hartsfield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;steele&quot;/&gt; Hartsfield's knives were hard ground from differentially heat-treated A2 tool steel and are known for their distinctive chisel-ground blades.&lt;ref name=&quot;tieves&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;steele&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Steele|1997|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; More accurately, they are zero ground; that is, the edge has no secondary [[bevel]], minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes. Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives, which Hartsfield granted.&lt;ref name=&quot;steele&quot;/&gt; When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife, he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEALS&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dockery|2004|pp=23–24.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;steele&quot;/&gt;

According to the SEALs' requirements, the knife had to be corrosion resistant, designed for easy cleaning in the field, durable enough to be used on a daily basis as a tool, and capable as a weapon should the need arise.&lt;ref name=&quot;garrett&quot;/&gt; Emerson's folding chisel-ground &quot;tantō&quot; became the sixth model in his Viper series and, while a handful of prototypes were referred to as &quot;Viper 6&quot;, the model was soon named the &quot;[[CQC-6]]&quot; ([[Close combat|CQC]] refers to close-quarters combat) and was chosen by the SEALs for use.&lt;ref name=&quot;garrett&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Garrett|1996|pp=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ewing1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ewing|2006|pp=172–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of a CQC-6 soon became something of a status symbol among members of various elite military units, including Navy SEALs, [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]], German [[GSG 9]], and [[Special Air Service|British SAS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guzy&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Guzy|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchy&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Perrin|2006|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this connection to the Special Warfare community, Emerson changed the name of his custom knife line to &quot;Specwar Knives&quot;, and in 1990 this new designation began appearing in the logo on his blades.&lt;ref name=&quot;ewing1&quot;/&gt;

Other models followed in the Specwar line bearing the CQC Series moniker, including the CQC-7 which is another chisel-ground tantō-bladed folder similar to the CQC-6 but with a saber-type handle shape.&lt;ref name=&quot;ewing1&quot;/&gt; The CQC-8 (&quot;Banana Knife&quot;) was a folder inspired by Bob Taylor's [[Warrior knife]] and  [[William F. Moran]]'s ST-23 is used by British SAS troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lights&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ewing|2004|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knife has the distinction of being the first folding knife that was designed to be [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] correct in both forward and reverse grip.&lt;ref name=&quot;garrett&quot;/&gt; Its users refer to it as &quot;the finest fighting knife ever developed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EK2007&quot;/&gt; The CQC-9 (&quot;Eagle Knife&quot;) is a reverse-curved hawkbill blade developed as a backup weapon for an American law enforcement agency; it has an opening hole in the blade licensed from knife manufacturer [[Spyderco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;garrett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;delavigne&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Delavigne|2004|p=163.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Emerson has standard models for these custom knives which progress in order to CQC16, each one is made individually by hand.&lt;ref name=tieves43&gt;{{harvnb|Tieves|1998|p=43.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=combs41&gt;{{harvnb|Combs|2004|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularizing the tactical knife==
[[File:timberline-specwar.jpg|thumb|alt=A black tanto bladed fighting knife. |Emerson-Neeley Timberline SPECWAR]]
While not the first knifemaker to build what is known as a tactical folding knife, Emerson was one of several makers who popularized the concept of the handmade tactical folder in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burch|2011|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shackleford|2003|pp=92–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emerson's knives began appearing in the ''[[Rogue Warrior (book)|Rogue Warrior]]'' series of novels written by the founder of the US Navy's [[SEAL Team Six]], [[Richard Marcinko]], at this time which helped fuel interest among collectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcinko3&quot;/&gt;

This surge in interest for Emerson's knives soon became overwhelming.&lt;ref name=&quot;haskew&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Haskew|2004|pp=24–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had been making knives full-time since 1994, Emerson was still manufacturing these knives in his home garage workshop three years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;lang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tieves43/&gt; As Emerson watched his customers' wait time expand from two years to seven, he realized that the demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his ability to produce them.&lt;ref name=&quot;lang&quot;/&gt; The first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations with established cutlery companies.&lt;ref name=tieves43/&gt;

Emerson's first collaboration with a knife manufacturer was with Timberline Knives in 1993 for his SPECWAR model.&lt;ref name=&quot;dick&quot;/&gt;  According to Stephen Dick, the editor of ''Tactical Knives'',  this collaboration was a result of &quot;the Navy deciding that only commercial designs would be considered due to failure of a previous custom knifemaker to deliver enough models to satisfy the need&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dick&quot;/&gt;  This model featured a one-side chisel-ground tantō blade almost 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch (6.35&amp;nbsp;mm) thick. Its handle was made from fiberglass-reinforced nylon molded around a near-full tang.  Vaughn Neeley of Timberline designed the sheath.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Overton|1995|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The knife was originally a custom piece designed for Naval Special Warfare Group One, and this factory version was soon entered in the trials for the [[Navy SEALs]] knife in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;dick&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dick|1995|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not chosen by the Navy, Stephen Dick reported that a number of members of SEAL Team One privately purchased the knife and were disappointed it was not made the official blade.&lt;ref name=&quot;dick&quot;/&gt; The Emerson-Neeley SPECWAR knife won ''[[Blade (magazine)|Blade Magazine]]''{{'}}s 1995 American Made Knife of the Year Award&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt; at the magazine's [[Blade Show]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and that same year and was displayed as an exhibit at the Metropolitan [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City from May 24 to August 15, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1995|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BM970.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two similar tanto bladed fighting knives one a custom the other a factory piece. |Emerson's custom CQC-6 alongside Benchmade's 970 (CQC-7)]]
In 1994 the president of [[Benchmade|Benchmade Knives]], Les DeAsis, approached Emerson to manufacture the CQC-6 on a larger scale as a factory production model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt; Preferring to keep the CQC-6 as a custom-only knife, Emerson instead licensed a similar design of his, the [[CQC-7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj&quot;&gt;
{{harvnb|Fritz|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cqc7&quot;/&gt;

The Benchmade factory version was sold under the model name BM970 or BM975 depending on blade length. Other designations followed which denoted blade finish,&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stanford|1999|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; manual or automatic opening, or partially serrated blade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt; The knife retained the profile of Emerson's custom piece in addition to the ATS-34 steel and the titanium liners.&lt;ref name=&quot;clarke&quot;/&gt; However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and [[micarta]] scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by [[Torx]] head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.&lt;ref name=&quot;pickles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clarke&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1995|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these changes the knife was true to Emerson's original design, and even though it did not have the craftsmanship of a handmade piece of cutlery it satisfied customers with their own version of Emerson's work at a lower price point and without the five-year wait.&lt;ref name=&quot;ewing1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cqc7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shackleford|2005|pp=42–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerson Knives, Inc.==
{{Main article|Emerson Knives, Inc.}}
&quot;First folding tanto with liner lock and G-10&quot; -Emerson. In February 1996, Emerson and his wife, Mary, founded Emerson Knives, Inc. (abbreviated as EKI) in Torrance, California to manufacture knives on a larger scale than he was then capable of.&lt;ref name=&quot;herndon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tieves43/&gt;  This new company would be a distinct entity from his Specwar custom knives, although several custom designs would make their way into the production lineup.&lt;ref name=&quot;covert&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Covert|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after starting this venture, Emerson sold an entire year's worth of production in four hours at the [[SHOT Show|SHOT]] (Shooting Hunting and Outdoor Trade) Show in January 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;shot&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|2000|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson continued to collaborate with other companies on knife-related projects as his own company grew. In some cases these collaborators had become his competition, such as [[Gerber Legendary Blades|Gerber Knives]]. In 2002 Emerson collaborated with Gerber Knives to create both companies' first [[switchblade|automatic opening knife]], the Gerber-Emerson Alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karwan|2003|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Emerson collaborated with [[Surefire|SureFire Flashlights]] by making an exclusive CQC-8 (Banana Knife) numbered and marked with the SureFire logo and sold with an identically numbered Emerson-marked Centurion C2 CombatLight.&lt;ref name=&quot;lights&quot;/&gt; In 2005 Emerson collaborated with Andy Prisco, the CEO of the American Tomahawk Company, to produce the CQC-T [[Tomahawk (axe)|Tomahawk]]. This tomahawk features a curved head machined from 4140 steel with a rear spike and a lightweight fiberglass handle. Although not made by Emerson, the tomahawk was designed by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steele|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Emerson announced a collaboration with custom knifemaker and knife thrower Bobby Branton. The collaboration piece is a fixed-blade knife designed primarily for [[knife throwing]] dubbed the BETT: Branton-Emerson Tactical Thrower. &quot;CQC-6 is the most collectible knife in the world&quot; -Emerson&lt;ref name=Gathering/&gt;

[[File:Emerson Commander knife.jpg|thumb|alt=A black recurve bladed knife. |Emerson Commander]]

One of Emerson's earliest production models, the [[Commander (knife)|Commander]] (winner of ''Blade Magazine''{{'}}s Overall Knife of the Year Award for 1999), is a large recurve folding knife based on a special custom design, the ES1-M, that he had made for a West Coast Navy SEAL Team.&lt;ref name=&quot;tieves&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;working&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dick|1997|pp=154–155.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commander has a hook on the spine of the blade (originally designed as a blade catcher) which, when snagged on the edge of the pocket or sheath, causes the knife blade to open as it is drawn.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEALS&quot;/&gt; Due to its visual aesthetic, Emerson called this innovation the &quot;Wave&quot;and secured a patent for it in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;wave&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since another knife and tool company, [[Leatherman]], had trademarked the name &quot;Wave,&quot; in March 1999 Emerson changed its name to the &quot;wave-shaped opening feature&quot;. Emerson's Wave made its way onto most of the knives in both the production and custom lines, with the exception of the Viper models. It is a required feature on all knives that Emerson supplies to military units, search and rescue units, and law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Overton|2007a|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EKISark.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black wharnecliffe bladed knife.|Emerson SARK]]

After a disastrous helicopter crash in 1999 resulting in the deaths of six [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and one sailor, the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] performed an assessment of their equipment and decided among other things that they needed a new search and rescue knife.&lt;ref name=camhop2002&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|2002|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[KA-BAR]] knives issued to the SBUs (Special Boat Units) had catastrophically failed to cut the Marines free from their webbing.&lt;ref name=combs41/&gt;

The Navy went to Emerson, who designed and fabricated a working prototype within 24&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=combs41/&gt; They found that it met their needs, and the model was dubbed the &quot;[[SARK]]&quot; (Search and Rescue Knife). The SARK is a folding knife with a [[Sheepsfoot knife|wharncliffe]]-style blade and a blunt tip designed so a rescuer could cut trapped victims free without stabbing them.&lt;ref name=camhop2002/&gt; The knife features Emerson's Wave.&lt;ref name=combs41/&gt; Seeing another need in the police community, Emerson replaced the blunt end of the SARK with a pointed end and named it the &quot;P-SARK&quot;, or Police Search And Rescue Knife.&lt;ref name=&quot;griffith&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Griffith|2002|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the Navy changed the requirements on the SARK to incorporate a guthook on the back of the blade for use as a line-cutter.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSAR&quot;/&gt;  Emerson made the change on this model which is only available to the US Navy and the model designation is the NSAR (Navy Search And Rescue) Knife.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSAR&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|US Navy|2007|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emerson NASA knife.jpg|thumb|alt=A black tanto bladed knife with a guthook in the tip.|Emerson NASA Knife]]

In 1999, [[NASA]] contracted Emerson to build a knife for use on [[Space Shuttle]] missions and the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name=nasa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Trzaska/&gt; Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement.&lt;ref name=kertzman/&gt; The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline with the addition of a guthook cut into the [[tantō]] point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages.&lt;ref name=kertzman&gt;{{harvnb|Kertzman|2001|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knife is not available for purchase outside of NASA.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA0&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2000, Emerson announced his semi-retirement from custom knifemaking in order to concentrate on this new production company and to fill the thousands of outstanding orders for his custom work.  He still makes custom knives available for sale at knife shows, but takes no orders for new custom work.&lt;ref name=&quot;top10&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shackleford|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;resale&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Haskew|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995 the only way to get a new custom knife from Emerson himself is through a lottery held at knife shows where he is present.&lt;ref name=&quot;top10&quot; /&gt; Depending on the size of the show, as many as several hundred potential buyers write their names on individual pieces of paper at his booth, and at a predetermined time a name is drawn. The winner gets a chance to buy one of the custom knives brought to the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;EK2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;resale&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, Emerson branched out in a new direction, announcing he would manufacture twelve custom electric guitars per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;EK2007&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Overton|2007b|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first guitar debuted at ''Blade Magazine''{{'}}s Blade Show in [[Atlanta]] in June 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;guitar&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Overton|2007c|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Emerson opened a clothing company called &quot;Emerson Brand Apparel&quot; specializing in MMA and casual clothing. In 2009 at the annual [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] Convention, Emerson announced a collaboration with custom pistol manufacturer [[Les Baer]] to produce a custom [[M1911]] pistol built to Emerson's specifications with a semi-custom (handground blade) folding knife named the &quot;CQC-45&quot;(out of sequence from the CQC series as the number relates to the caliber of the pistol).&lt;ref name=&quot;STLB&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Guthrie|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2009, Emerson announced a collaboration with Spike's Tactical to produce an [[M-4 Carbine]] based upon his specifications for training, chambered in .22 long rifle and in 5.56 NATO; with a matching folding knife designated the &quot;CQC-22&quot; (out of sequence from the CQC series as the number relates to the caliber of the rifle).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spike|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Emerson announced a collaboration with [[Pro-Tech Knives]] to produce an automatic opening version of the CQC-7.  In November 2010, Emerson's Roadhouse Knife won ''Knives Illustrated''{{'}}s American Made Knife of 2010–2011 Award at the Spirit of Steel Show in Knoxville, TN.  According to Emerson, the knife will be used as a prop on the ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' Television Show.&lt;ref name=Gathering&gt;{{harvnb|Searson|2011|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, at the SHOT (Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade) Show in Las Vegas, NV, Emerson debuted a new knife model designed in collaboration with [[Jim Grover (martial arts)|Kelly McCann]] known as the ''Canis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|Lamothe|Bacon|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerson's knives in the media==
''[[New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times]]'' bestselling author [[David Morrell]]'s novel ''The Protector'' not only has the main character, a former [[Delta Force]] operator named Cavanaugh, using an Emerson CQC-7 knife, but the cover art itself is a photographic illustration of a blood-stained  Emerson CQC-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrell|2003|pp=259–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavanaugh uses the knife in combat as well as in many rigorous cutting chores. The author claims Emerson is &quot;the best manufacturer of tactical knives&quot; as well as a &quot;top level blade instructor for elite military and law-enforcement units&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrell|2003|pp=''viii''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with British E-Zine ''Shots : The Crime and Mystery Ezine'', Morrell indicated that he injured his collarbone during an Emerson knife-fighting course while performing research for the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karim|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrell went on to include Emerson's knives in his books ''Creepers'' and ''The Spy Who Came for Christmas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrell|2006|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrell|2011|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerson Combat Systems==
{{Main article|Emerson Combat Systems}}
Emerson  has developed a combatives system drawn upon his experience  known as [[Emerson Combat Systems]], which has been taught to hundreds of law enforcement agencies, members of the U.S. military, and civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;herndon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;steele&quot;/&gt;

According to Emerson, the techniques are based upon the physical and instinctual laws that govern the survival instincts and physical function of a human being.&lt;ref name=&quot;combatives&quot;/&gt;  This system is characterized by training as realistically as possible (not training in workout gear for example) and using flowing, dynamic concepts (for example, integrated fighting and weapon transition with a strong emphasis placed on overall physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2005|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson maintains he does not teach a &quot;martial art&quot; encumbered by ritual or sporting aspects but a combatives system where the goal is more than simple self-defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;combatives&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3rules&quot;/&gt;

Emerson has been consulted as a technical advisor to television and movie productions including ''[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]'', specifically the program ''[[Fight Science]]'', due in part to his position as the hand-to-hand combat instructor for [[Harry Humphries]]' Global Studies Group Incorporated, a company that teaches police and military tactics to law enforcement agencies and film production crews.&lt;ref name=&quot;waterman&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Waterman|1997|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chalker&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chalker|Dockery|2003|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an author, Emerson has written over 30 articles on hand-to-hand combat, knife fighting, history, and knifemaking for publications including ''[[Human Events]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blade (magazine)|Blade Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2001|pp=118–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Cop Magazine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2006a|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Martial Arts Experts'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2006b|pp=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Journal of Modern Combatives'',&lt;ref name=&quot;combatives&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2006c|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inside Kung-Fu'',&lt;ref name=&quot;3rules&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|1999|pp=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Black Belt Magazine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2006d|pp=98–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Police Magazine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2002b|pp=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[American Handgunner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emerson|2007|pp=82–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Emerson was inducted into the ''Black Belt Magazine'' Hall of Fame as &quot;Self-Defense Instructor of the Year&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOF&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2015|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
