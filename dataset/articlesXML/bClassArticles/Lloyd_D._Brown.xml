[[Major general (United_States)|Major General]] '''Lloyd Davidson Brown''' (July 28, 1892 – February 17, 1950) was a senior [[United States Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who commanded the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Division]] in [[World War II]].

==Early life==
Lloyd Davidson Brown was born in [[Sharon, Georgia]] on July 28, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis Who's Who, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rjQOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22brown,+lloyd+davidson%22+sharon+1892&amp;dq=%22brown,+lloyd+davidson%22+sharon+1892&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LGM8U4_OKcuxsQT1o4H4CA&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA Who Was Who in American History: The Military], 1975, page 68&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]]’s [[Academy of Richmond County]] in 1908, and the [[University of Georgia]] in 1912. He was a member of [[Phi Delta Theta]] and [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]], and after graduating was employed as an instructor at [[Woodward Academy|Georgia Military Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;George Fuller Walker, Persons Lineage, 1951, page 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, the same year of the [[American entry into World War I]], Brown received his [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the [[United States Army]] as a [[Second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry Branch]], and was originally assigned to the [[26th Infantry Regiment (United States)|26th Infantry Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Army and Navy Register, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lVQ-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+26th+infantry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=53E8U_WKC-LJsQTukYKgBA&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lloyd%20d%20brown%22%2026th%20infantry&amp;f=false Assignments of Officers], July 14, 1917, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; During the war he served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as a [[company commander]] of 'G' Company, 2nd Battalion, [[61st Infantry Regiment (United States)|61st Infantry Regiment]], part of the [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Division]] of the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cantey Whitaker Allen, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=B3M8U86sHfepsASNqIGIBQ&amp;id=rY1bAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=brown+%2261st+infantry%22+%22world+war%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%2261st+infantry%22 Our Children's Ancestry], 1935, page 437&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-World War I==
Brown’s post-war assignments included Professor of Military Science at [[Riverside Military Academy]] in [[Gainesville, Georgia]], and postings as a company commander and regimental Plans, Operations and Training (S3) [[Staff (military)|staff officer]] for the [[45th Infantry Regiment (United States)|45th Infantry Regiment]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;Army and Navy Register, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YFM-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA407&amp;dq=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+military+science&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OE08U5f4DvS0sQS82oGIAg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lloyd%20d%20brown%22%20military%20science&amp;f=false The Army: Infantry], October 16, 1920, page 406&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Adjutant General, [https://archive.org/stream/officersofarmy20adju#page/n549/mode/2up Officers of the Army], April 1931, page 173&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from the Infantry Officer Course in 1923, the Infantry Advanced Course in 1928, and the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|U.S. Army Command and General Staff College]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Adjutant General, [https://archive.org/stream/officialarmyregi1946unit#page/86/mode/2up Official U.S. Army Register], 1946, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s he served on the staff of the [[National Guard Bureau]], and was an instructor and advisor for the [[Illinois Army National Guard]]’s [[131st Infantry Regiment (United States)|131st Infantry Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Infantry Association, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zXDpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+army+register&amp;dq=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+army+register&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WFU8U6avG8jUsATjuYGYDA&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwBw Infantry Journal], Volume 44, 1937, pages 356, 457&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Illinois Military and Naval Department, [https://archive.org/stream/circularsillinoi4201illi#page/n143/mode/2up/search/lloyd National Guard Bureau Circular], 1938, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==

Brown served on the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] staff at the start of [[World War II]], and subsequently served as Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and Training (G3) at Headquarters, [[Army Ground Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;William C. Sylvan, Francis G. Smith Jr., [https://books.google.com/books?id=SxrW0l-ECKQC&amp;pg=PT633&amp;dq=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+army+ground+forces&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VWU8U7upBIPMsQSC84LwDQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lloyd%20d%20brown%22%20army%20ground%20forces&amp;f=false Normandy to Victory: The War Diary of General Courtney H. Hodges], 2009, Chapter 2, Footnote 14&lt;/ref&gt; During the U.S. Army’s huge wartime expansion he was accused of encouraging [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] officers to have National Guard senior officers replaced by writing negative performance evaluations on them, enabling Regular Army officers to fill these positions and receive promotions and command assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Roberts Greenfield, Robert R. Palmer and Bell I. Wiley, [http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/002/2-1/CMH_Pub_2-1.pdf United States Army in World War II: The Army Ground Forces, The Organization of Ground Combat Troops], 1987, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Weaver, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PrDsnbSjY_AC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+%22national+guard%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kEw8U7eFNKrQsQSb7ICgDg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lloyd%20d%20brown%22%20%22national%20guard%22&amp;f=false Guard Wars: The 28th Infantry Division in World War II], 2010, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Dan Hill, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tsIdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+%22university+of+georgia%22&amp;dq=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+%22university+of+georgia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=01E8U-zpN6irsATR4oDQCw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg The Minute Man in Peace and War: A History of the National Guard], 1964, page 414&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Catlett Marshall, author, Larry I. Bland, Sharon Ritenour Stevens, editors, [https://books.google.com/books?id=plMfAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+%22army+ground+forces%22&amp;dq=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+%22army+ground+forces%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g09AU8ehBLehsASon4HACQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ The Papers of George Catlett Marshall: &quot;The Right Man for the Job”, December 7, 1941-May 31, 1943], 1991, pages 220, 226&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 he became the [[102nd Infantry Division (United States)|102nd Infantry Division]]’s Assistant Division Commander (ADC) as a temporary [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].&lt;ref&gt;Paris (Texas) News, [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/13449465/ Assistant Division Commander For Maxey Reports], August 14, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1943 he was promoted to temporary [[Major general (United States)|major general]] as [[Commanding officer|Commanding General]] (CG) of the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Division]], an Army National Guard formation, succeeding Major General [[Omar Bradley]], who had been assigned as [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]’s personal representative in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|North African Theater of Operations]]. Brown led the division during training in the United States and left for the [[United Kingdom]] in October 1943, arriving in [[South Wales]] soon afterwards. There the division trained for several months until late July 1944 when it was sent to [[Northern France]] to take part in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]], codenamed [[Operation Overlord]], and saw its first combat in [[Operation Cobra]], in an attempt to break out of the [[Normandy]] [[beachhead]] and end the temporary [[stalemate]]. He served until being relieved in August 1944 over concerns that his division was not progressing rapidly enough against [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] defenses.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Weaver, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PrDsnbSjY_AC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+28th+division+bradley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xkxAU9xE896wBIbSgegI&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lloyd%20d%20brown%22%2028th%20division%20bradley&amp;f=false Guard Wars: The 28th Infantry Division in World War II], 2010, page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown’s performance and subsequent reputation were mixed. [[XIX Corps (United States)|XIX Corps]] commander Major General [[Charles H. Corlett]] thought Brown needed a medical leave because he was sick and “rundown.” One of Brown’s battalion commanders thought Brown was not up to the challenge of commanding large units in combat and described him as “frantic.” Bradley, now a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], commanding the [[Twelfth United States Army Group|U.S. 12th Army Group]], and General Eisenhower, the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] in the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]] (ETO), believed Brown was personally brave, but not an inspirational leader, and that his soldiers underperformed as a result. Unlike several other division commanders who were relieved and later received second opportunities to command, in Brown's case Eisenhower recommended to General [[George Marshall]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]], that he not be given another command. Marshall concurred.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rawson, [http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/2824/1/Rawson_11_MPhil.pdf The Divisional Commander in the U.S. Army in World War II: A Case Study of the Normandy Campaign, 6 June 1944 to 24 July 1944], 2011, pages 128-129&lt;/ref&gt; Brown was replaced by Brigadier General [[James Edward Wharton|James Wharton]], who was killed by a sniper while visiting the front-line soon after he took command. He, in turn, was replaced by Brigadier General [[Norman Cota]], formerly the ADC of the [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Infantry Division]].

Brown reverted to his permanent rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and served in various staff assignments, including Director of Training at the [[United States Army Infantry School|U.S. Army Infantry School]], until retiring from the army in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Army and Navy Journal, Incorporated, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=EU5AU67DMLOmsASB34G4Aw&amp;id=OzNVAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+%22infantry+school%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22lloyd+d+brown%22 Armed Forces Journal International], Volume 84, Issues 1-26, 1946, page 274&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 he was promoted to major general on the retired list.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Sylvan, Francis G. Smith Jr., [https://books.google.com/books?id=SxrW0l-ECKQC&amp;pg=PT633&amp;dq=%22lloyd+d+brown%22+army+ground+forces&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VWU8U7upBIPMsQSC84LwDQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lloyd%20d%20brown%22%20army%20ground%20forces&amp;f=false Normandy to Victory: The War Diary of General Courtney H.

==Awards==
Brown’s awards included the [[Silver Star]] and [[Legion of Merit]], and Lloyd Brown Hall at [[Fort Benning]] was named for him.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Adjutant General, [https://archive.org/stream/officialarmyregi1947unit#page/138/mode/2up Official U.S. Army Register], 1947, page 138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Adjutant General, [https://archive.org/stream/officialarmyregi1949unit#page/630/mode/2up Official U.S. Army Register], 1949, page 630&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Home of Heroes, [http://www.homeofheroes.com/members/04_SS/2_WWII/indexes/army/Army-Bo.html U.S. Army Awards of the Silver Star in World War II], entry for Brown, Lloyd D., XIX Corps, retrieved April 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Harvill Standard, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=VXE8U92JCIqmsATwyoCABQ&amp;id=fNpOAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22brown+hall%22+%22infantry+school%22+lloyd&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22brown+hall%22 The Historic Homes of Washington, Georgia], 1973, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;
