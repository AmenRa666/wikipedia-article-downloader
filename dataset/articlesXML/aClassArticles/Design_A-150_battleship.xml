'''Design A-150''', also known as the '''''Super Yamato'' class''',&lt;ref group=A&gt;Although called the &quot;Super Yamato class&quot; by some, Design A-150 was an entirely new design that derived little from the design of the {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|2}}s. See: Garzke and Dulin, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] plan for a [[ship class|class]] of [[battleship]]s. Begun in 1938–39, the design was mostly complete by 1941. However, so that a demand for other types of warships could be met, all work on Design A-150 was halted and no [[keel]]s were laid. Authors William H. Garzke and Robert O. Dulin have argued that Design A-150 would have been the &quot;most powerful battleships in history&quot; because of the massive size of their main battery of six {{convert|510|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns as well as numerous smaller caliber weapons.&lt;ref name=Garzke85/&gt;

==Design==

===Background===
Initial plans for the A-150 battleships called for eight or nine {{convert|510|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} guns in double or triple turrets. The successful construction of a {{convert|480|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} gun in 1920–1921 made the Japanese confident that a {{convert|510|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} could be built. In addition, a top speed of {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}} was desired so that the class would be faster than the United States' {{convert|27|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} {{sclass-|North Carolina|battleship|1}}s. However, these grand specifications were curtailed when tests culminated in a ship that had a [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] of some 90,000&amp;nbsp;tons; it was felt that ships of this size would be &quot;too large and too expensive&quot;.&lt;ref name=Garzke85&gt;Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specifications===
Initial design studies were undertaken after the completion of plans for the {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|4}} (1938–39); they focused on a ship with a displacement nearer to that of the ''Yamato''s.&lt;ref name=Gnmnjbbbhvgyiknjbhbvvttfghvbytvcyyvctvftarzke85-86&gt;Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; As the Japanese expected that the Americans would be able to obtain the true characteristics of that class (namely the principal armament of {{convert|460|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}), the use of 510&amp;nbsp;mm guns was vital to keep with Japan's policy of individual ships' superiority over their American counterparts; the A-150s were meant to counter [[Montana-class battleship|the United States' reply]] to the ''Yamato''s.&lt;ref name=Garzke85/&gt;

Plans were &quot;essentially completed&quot; sometime in 1941;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gnmnjbbbhvgyiknjbhbvvttfghvbytvcyyvctvftarzke85-86&quot; /&gt; however, similar to the fate of documents relating to the ''Yamato'' class,&lt;ref&gt;Muir (1990), p. 485&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skulski (1989), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; most papers and all plans relating to the class were destroyed at the end of the war, meaning that the full specifications of the ships are not known.&lt;ref name=Garzke85/&gt; It is known the ships would have had greater firepower than the ''Yamato'' class: a main battery of six 510&amp;nbsp;mm (20.1&amp;nbsp;inch) guns in three twin [[gun turret|turrets]] and a secondary armament of &quot;many&quot; {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}/65 caliber guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gnmnjbbbhvgyiknjbhbvvttfghvbytvcyyvctvftarzke85-86&quot; /&gt; The displacement was to be similar to the ''Yamato'' class, which was around 60,000–70,000 [[metric ton|tonnes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gnmnjbbbhvgyiknjbhbvvttfghvbytvcyyvctvftarzke85-86&quot; /&gt; The side armor [[Belt armor|belt]] was probably going to be {{convert|460|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's&quot;&gt;Gardiner and Chesneau (1980), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; This was so large that steel mills in Japan were incapable of manufacturing it; instead, &quot;double [[strake]]s of armor plates&quot; were going to be used, which would have been much less effective than just one single plate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gnmnjbbbhvgyiknjbhbvvttfghvbytvcyyvctvftarzke85-86&quot; /&gt;

===Armament===
Although details of the smaller armament planned for the ships are not given in sources, a main battery of six {{convert|510|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}/45 [[caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|caliber]] guns in dual [[gun turret|turrets]] was definitely planned. These would have been the largest ever fitted to a [[capital ship]], dwarfing the {{convert|460|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} guns mounted on the ''Yamato'' class.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 85 and 88&lt;/ref&gt; By 1941, one—possibly two—of the 510&amp;nbsp;mm guns were being constructed at the [[Kure Naval Arsenal]] and detailed designs of the turrets that would hold the guns were drawn up. The turrets would have weighed {{convert|2780|t|LT|lk=out}} and [[:wikt:train#Verb|trained]] at {{formatnum:2}}° per second through a range of {{formatnum:120}}° to port or starboard. The guns themselves could have fired at a maximum rate of 1 to 1.5 rounds per minute and be [[Gun laying|elevated]] from {{formatnum:-5}}° to {{formatnum:45}}°, with the elevation rate being {{formatnum:10}}° per second. They would have weighed {{convert|227|t|LT|abbr=on}} and would have been {{convert|23.56|m|in|abbr=on}} long. The [[gauge (bore diameter)|bore]] length was to have been around {{convert|22.84|m|in|abbr=on}}. The [[armor-piercing shell|armor-piercing]] ammunition would have weighed between 1900 and 2000&amp;nbsp;kg (4190–4409&amp;nbsp;lbs), while the [[Shell (projectile)#High-explosive|high explosive]] rounds would have been {{convert|1858|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=510mm&gt;{{cite web | last=DiGiulian | first=Tony | title=51 cm/45 (20.1&quot;) &quot;A&quot; Type 98 (?) | url=http://navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_20-45.htm | publisher=Navweaps | date=9 October 2006 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary battery of &quot;many&quot; {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}/65 caliber guns was being considered, although this was not final. This design was the best [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] gun produced by Japan during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=10cm&gt;{{cite web | last=DiGiulian | first=Tony | title=10 cm/65 (3.9&quot;) Type 98 | url=http://navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_39-65_t98.htm | publisher=Navweaps | date=9 October 2006 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the weapons compared very well with other contemporary weapons. The key advantages that made it so successful—the &quot;high muzzle velocity and a fast rate of fire&quot;—resulted in a short 350–400-round service life. In anti-aircraft defense, their ceiling at {{formatnum:90}}° was {{convert|13000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, although the effective range was {{convert|11000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. They were able to fire 15–21 rounds per minute.&lt;ref name=10cm/&gt;

In ''Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II'', authors William H. Garzke and Robert O. Dulin argued that Design A-150 would have been the &quot;most powerful battleships in history&quot;&lt;ref name=Garzke85/&gt; because of the titanic main armament and the use of a dual purpose secondary battery.&lt;ref name=Garzke85/&gt;

==Construction==
With war on the horizon in early 1941, all design work was diverted from battleships—even though the A-150s' design was virtually complete—so that a demand for &quot;[[aircraft carrier]]s, [[cruiser]]s, and smaller ships&quot;&lt;ref name=Garzke85/&gt; could be met. Even though no work was being done on them, two ships of Design A-150, provisionally designated as Warships Number 798 and 799, were projected in a 1942 building program. 798 was to be built in the same dock as {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shinano||2}}, while 799 was to be built in [[Kure]] in the same dock as {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} after the fourth ship in the class, Warship Number 111, was [[ship naming and launching|launched]]. Both of the ships' [[keel]]s were supposed to be laid in late 1941 or early 1942, launched in 1944/45, and finished in 1946/47. However, the war's turn against the Japanese after the [[Battle of Midway]] meant that the need for ships other than battleships never abated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gnmnjbbbhvgyiknjbhbvvttfghvbytvcyyvctvftarzke85-86&quot; /&gt;
