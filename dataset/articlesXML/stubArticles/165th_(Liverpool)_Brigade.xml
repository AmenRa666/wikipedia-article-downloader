The '''165th (Liverpool) Brigade''' was an [[infantry]] [[brigade]] of the [[British Army]] that served during [[World War I]] and remained in the United Kingdom throughout [[World War II]]. In both wars the brigade was part of [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division]].

==Formation==
The brigade was raised in 1908 when the [[Territorial Force]] was created, by the amalgamation of the [[Yeomanry]] and the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], and was originally formed as the '''Liverpool Brigade''' attached to the West Lancashire Division. The brigade was composed of the 5th, [[Liverpool Rifles|6th]], 7th and [[Liverpool Irish|8th]] battalions of the [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)]].

==First World War==
The [[World War I|Great War]] began in August 1914 and most of the men of the brigade immediately volunteered for [[Territorial Force Imperial Service Badge|Imperial Service]] overseas although they were not obliged to do so, as the Territorial Force was initially intended to act as a home defence force during wartime. The Territorial Force was, therefore, split into a 1st Line and a 2nd Line. The 1st Line was liable for service overseas and the 2nd Line was intended to perform a home defence role and to send drafts of replacements to the 1st Line units serving overseas. The West Lancashire Division and Liverpool Brigade formed a duplicate 2nd Line units, the 2nd West Lancashire Division and 2nd Liverpool Brigade. To distinguish the 1st Line battalions from the 2nd Line, they adopted the fractional '1/', for all 1st Line units, (1/5th King's) and '2/' (2/5th King's) for all 2nd Line.

However, between November 1914 and March 1915, all the infantry battalions of the West Lancashire Division were sent overseas to France and Belgium to reinforce the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] which had suffered heavy casualties and was struggling to hold the line. As a result, the division was temporarily disbanded and the 1st Liverpool Brigade joined with its 2nd Line, now numbered as the [[171st (2/1st Liverpool) Brigade]], and the division [[57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division]].

In early 1916 the West Lancashire Division was reformed, and now numbered as the [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division|55th (West Lancashire) Division]] and the brigades were also numbered, the 1st Liverpool Brigade becoming '''165th (1st Liverpool) Brigade'''

The brigade served with the 55th Division for the rest of the war on the Western Front at the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Battle of Ypres]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] and the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of Estaires]] in 1918.

==Between the wars==
The brigade was disbanded after the war in 1919 when the Territorial Force was disbanded. It was later renamed in 1920 as the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. The brigade came into existence again as the '''165th (Liverpool) Infantry Brigade''', again assigned to the 55th Division and again had the same four battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool). However, under [[Geddes's Axe]], the [[Liverpool Irish|8th (Irish) Battalion]] was disbanded on 31 March 1922 and were replaced in the brigade by the [[Liverpool Scottish|10th (Scottish) Battalion]], previously from the [[166th (South Lancashire) Brigade|166th (South Lancashire) Infantry Brigade]].

The composition of the brigade remained unchanged throughout most of the inter-war years. In the late 1930s, however, many infantry battalions of the Territorial Army were converted to new roles, mainly anti-aircraft or searchlight units. The [[Liverpool Rifles|6th (Rifle) Battalion]] was transferred to the [[Royal Engineers]] and converted to [[Liverpool Rifles|38th (The King's) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers]], assigned to the [[33rd (Western) Anti-Aircraft Brigade|33rd (Western) Anti-Aircraft Group]], [[2nd Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Anti-Aircraft Division]], serving alongside other units converted from infantry battalions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/2-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1936-38-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They replaced in the brigade by the 4th/5th Battalion, [[Cheshire Regiment]]. In 1938, the 10th (Scottish) Battalion was transferred to the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]] and was re-titled as the [[Liverpool Scottish]] but remained with the brigade. In the same year, when all infantry brigades of the British Army were reduced from four to three battalions, the 7th Battalion, King's was transferred to the [[Royal Tank Regiment]] and became [[40th (The King's) Royal Tank Regiment]], assigned to [[23rd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|23rd Army Tank Brigade]]. When the 7th Battalion left to become 40th RTR they were replaced by 4th Battalion, [[South Lancashire Regiment]], previously from 166th (South Lancashire) Infantry Brigade. Sometime in 1939, the brigade was redesignated '''165th Infantry Brigade'''.

==Second World War==
The brigade again served in [[World War II]] with the 55th Division throughout the war and, in October 1941, no longer was an operational formation to be sent overseas. In January 1942 it was reduced to a Lower Establishment yet it was not reduced to a training division as most others were. In December 1943, with the division, it was sent to Northern Ireland and was raised to a Higher Establishment in May 1944, before returning to the United Kingdom in July. It served there until the war finally ended in 1945 and the division was disbanded in 1946 and was not reformed.

* 1st Battalion, [[Liverpool Scottish]], ([[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]]) ''(to 13 July 1944)''
