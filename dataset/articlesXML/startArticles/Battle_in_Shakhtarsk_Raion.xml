The '''battle in [[Shakhtarsk Raion]]''' began on 16 July 2014, when the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]] began an attempt to cut off insurgent supply lines from Russia. Fighting broke out around the towns of Marynivka, [[Dmytrivka, Donetsk Oblast|Dmytrivka]], [[Stepanivka]], [[Shakhtarsk]], and also the strategic hill of [[Savur-Mohyla]]. It later spread to the cities of [[Snizhne]] and [[Torez]]. While the battle was in progress, a civilian passenger airliner, [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]], was shot down near [[Hrabove, Donetsk Oblast|Hrabove]]. Amidst a wide counter-offensive by the insurgents and their [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russian backers]] across Donbass, government troops were forced out of Shakhtarsk Raion on 26 August.

==Events by location==
From 6 April, as part of the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|rising unrest]] in Ukraine in the aftermath of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]], insurgents affiliated with the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] (DPR) captured towns and cities across [[Donetsk Oblast]], including Shakhtarsk Raion. The raion is in a crucial position between the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, and Russia. Government forces launched an offensive against insurgent forces in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine on 7 April, resulting in the [[War in Donbass]]. War reached Shakhtarsk Raion on 16 July, after insurgents retreated from most of northern Donetsk Oblast. Fighting took place across the raion, in an attempt by the government to cut-off insurgent supply lines, and to reach the crash site of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]].

===Stepanivka===
DPR-affiliated insurgents launched an offensive on neighbouring government-controlled Marynivka from village of [[Stepanivka]] on 16 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://video.news.rin.ru/eng/news/45344/ |title=The national guard under: militia attacked the Stepanovka under Donetsk |date=16 July 2014 |work=RIN.ru |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archivedate=12 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204205/http://video.news.rin.ru/eng/news/45344/ |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian forces said that they retook Stepanivka from the insurgents on 29 July, and then advanced towards nearby [[Pervomaisk, Luhansk Oblast|Pervomaisk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Stepanivka Is Liberated.

===Marynivka===
Marynivka is a border town located in the southern Donetsk Oblast. Its position on the border made control of it important to maintaining insurgent supply-lines. Insurgents launched an offensive on [[National Guard of Ukraine]] positions in the town on 16 July, after breaking through encirclement by government forces in neighbouring Stepanivka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/16/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSKBN0FL0K020140716 |title=More Ukrainian soldiers killed as fighting rages in east, peace move flops |last1=Balmforth |first1=Richard |last2=Zverev |first2=Anton |date=16 July 2014 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=22 August 2014 |archivedate=26 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726053242/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/16/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSKBN0FL0K020140716 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting also spread to the nearby village of Tarany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Militants attack National Guard positions in Donetsk oblast |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/militants-attack-national-guard-positions-in-donetsk-oblast-356258.html |newspaper=[[Kyiv Post]] |agency=Interfax-Ukraine |date=16 July 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014 |archivedate=17 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717220818/http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/militants-attack-national-guard-positions-in-donetsk-oblast-356258.html |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this offensive, the insurgents used tanks, mortars, and anti-tank missiles against government forces.

Ukrainian forces came under continued attack by the insurgents in Marynivka, despite managing to hold onto control of it on 16 July.

[[File:Snezhnoe 060.jpg|thumb|right|The strategic hill Savur-Mohyla, as seen from Snizhne. Insurgents used the hill to shell government positions in Marynivka]]
[[Savur-Mohyla]] is a strategically important hill near the [[Russo-Ukrainian border]], and overlooks the villages of Dmytrivka and Marynivka. DPR-affiliated insurgents used the hill to shell the government-controlled village of Marynivka on 16 July, amidst an offensive by the insurgents on that village. In response, the [[Air Force of Ukraine]] attacked insurgents positions on the hill, whilst the insurgents tried to repel this attack by firing anti-aircraft guns at Air Force aeroplanes. Government forces near that were encircled near the hill tried to break out of encirclement and rout the insurgents on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Militia goes on offensive near outskirts of Donetsk - Ukrainian troops |url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_07_16/Militia-goes-on-offensive-near-outskirts-of-Donetsk-Ukrainian-troops-3694/ |work=The [[Voice of Russia]] |date=16 July 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014 |archivedate=3 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803182645/http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_07_16/Militia-goes-on-offensive-near-outskirts-of-Donetsk-Ukrainian-troops-3694/ |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian [[fighter jets]] were shot down near the hill on 23 July.
