'''John Pope''' (March 16, 1822 – September 23, 1892) was a career [[United States Army]] officer and [[Union Army|Union]] general in the [[American Civil War]]. He had a brief but successful career in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], but he is best known for his defeat at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] (Second Manassas) in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|East]].

Pope was a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1842. He served in the [[Mexican-American War]] and had numerous assignments as a topographical engineer and surveyor in [[Florida]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Minnesota]]. He spent much of the last decade before the Civil War surveying possible southern routes for the proposed [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. He was an early appointee as a Union [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers and served initially under Maj. Gen. [[John C. Frémont]]. He achieved initial success against Brig. Gen. [[Sterling Price]] in [[Missouri]], then led a successful campaign that captured [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] on the [[Mississippi River]]. This inspired the [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln administration]] to bring him to the Eastern Theater to lead the newly formed [[Army of Virginia]].

He initially alienated many of his officers and men by publicly denigrating their record in comparison to his Western command. He launched an offensive against the Confederate army of General [[Robert E. Lee]], in which he fell prey to a strategic turning movement into his rear areas by Maj. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson]]. At Second Bull Run, he concentrated his attention on attacking Jackson while the other Confederate corps attacked his flank and routed his army. Following Manassas, Pope was banished far from the Eastern Theater to the [[Department of the Northwest]] in Minnesota, where he commanded U.S. Forces in the [[Dakota War of 1862]]. He was appointed to command the [[Department of the Missouri]] in 1865 and was a prominent and activist commander during [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in [[Atlanta]]. For the rest of his military career, he fought in the [[Indian Wars]], particularly against the [[Apache]] and [[Sioux]].

==Early life==
Pope was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], the son of [[Nathaniel Pope]], a prominent Federal judge in early [[Illinois Territory]] and a friend of lawyer [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederiksen&quot;&gt;Frederiksen, pp. 1541–43.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the brother-in-law of [[Manning Force]], and a distant cousin married the sister of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher&quot;&gt;Eicher, pp. 433–34.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1842, and was commissioned a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher&quot; /&gt; He served in [[Florida]] and then helped survey the northeastern border between the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. He fought under [[Zachary Taylor]] in the [[Battle of Monterrey]] and [[Battle of Buena Vista]] during the [[Mexican-American War]], for which he was appointed a brevet [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] and [[Captain (United States)|captain]], respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher&quot; /&gt; After the war Pope worked as a surveyor in Minnesota. In 1850 he demonstrated the navigability of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]. He served as the chief engineer of the Department of New Mexico from 1851 to 1853 and spent the remainder of the antebellum years [[Pacific Railroad Surveys|surveying a route]] for the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Pacific Railroad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederiksen&quot; /&gt;

==Civil War==
Pope was serving on lighthouse duty when Abraham Lincoln was elected and he was one of four officers selected to escort the president-elect to [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederiksen&quot; /&gt; He offered to serve Lincoln as an aide, but on June 14, 1861, he was appointed [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers (date of rank effective May 17, 1861)&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;&gt;Warner, pp. 376–77.&lt;/ref&gt; and was ordered to Illinois to recruit volunteers.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the [[Department of the West]] under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[John C. Frémont]], Pope assumed command of the District of North and Central Missouri in July, with operational control along a portion of the [[Mississippi River]]. He had an uncomfortable relationship with Frémont and politicked behind the scenes to get him removed from command. Frémont was convinced that Pope had treacherous intentions toward him, demonstrated by his lack of action in following Frémont's offensive plans in Missouri. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] wrote, &quot;Actually, incompetence and timidity offer a better explanation of Pope than treachery, though he certainly showed an insubordinate spirit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope eventually forced the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] under [[Sterling Price]] to retreat southward, taking 1,200 prisoners in a minor action at [[Blackwater, Missouri]], on December 18. Pope, who established a reputation as a braggart early in the war, was able to generate significant press interest in his minor victory, which brought him to the attention of Frémont's replacement, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederiksen&quot; /&gt;

Halleck appointed Pope to command the [[Army of the Mississippi]] (and the District of the Mississippi, Department of the Missouri) on February 23, 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher&quot; /&gt; Given 25,000 men, he was ordered to clear Confederate obstacles on the [[Mississippi River]]. He made a surprise march on [[Battle of New Madrid|New Madrid]], Missouri, and captured it on March 14. He then orchestrated a campaign to capture [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]], a strongly fortified post garrisoned by 12,000 men and 58 guns. Pope's engineers cut a channel that allowed him to bypass the island. Assisted by the gunboats of Captain [[Andrew H. Foote]], he landed his men on the opposite shore, which isolated the defenders. The island garrison surrendered on April 7, 1862, freeing Union navigation of the Mississippi as far south as [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederiksen&quot; /&gt;

Pope's outstanding performance on the Mississippi earned him a promotion to major general, dated as of March 21, 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher&quot; /&gt; During the [[Siege of Corinth]], he commanded the left wing of Halleck's army, but he was soon summoned to the East by Lincoln. After the collapse of Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]]'s [[Peninsula Campaign]], Pope was appointed to command the [[Army of Virginia]], assembled from scattered forces in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and [[Northern Virginia]]. This promotion infuriated Frémont, who resigned his commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederiksen&quot; /&gt;

Pope brought an attitude of self-assurance that was offensive to the eastern soldiers under his command. He issued an astonishing message to his new army on July 14, 1862, that included the following:&lt;ref&gt;Hennessy, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Let us understand each other. I have come to you from the West, where we have always seen the backs of our enemies; from an army whose business it has been to seek the adversary and to beat him when he was found; whose policy has been attack and not defense. In but one instance has the enemy been able to place our Western armies in defensive attitude. I presume that I have been called here to pursue the same system and to lead you against the enemy. It is my purpose to do so, and that speedily. I am sure you long for an opportunity to win the distinction you are capable of achieving. That opportunity I shall endeavor to give you. Meantime I desire you to dismiss from your minds certain phrases, which I am sorry to find so much in vogue amongst you. I hear constantly of &quot;taking strong positions and holding them,&quot; of &quot;lines of retreat,&quot; and of &quot;bases of supplies.&quot; Let us discard such ideas. The strongest position a soldier should desire to occupy is one from which he can most easily advance against the enemy. Let us study the probable lines of retreat of our opponents, and leave our own to take care of themselves. Let us look before us, and not behind. Success and glory are in the advance, disaster and shame lurk in the rear. Let us act on this understanding, and it is safe to predict that your banners shall be inscribed with many a glorious deed and that your names will be dear to your countrymen forever|John Pope, message to the Army of Virginia}}

[[File:John Pope.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Major General]] John Pope]]
Despite this bravado, and despite receiving units from McClellan's [[Army of the Potomac]] that swelled the Army of Virginia to 70,000 men, Pope's aggressiveness exceeded his strategic capabilities, particularly since he was now facing Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]]. Lee, sensing that Pope was indecisive, split his smaller (55,000 man) army, sending Maj. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]] with 24,000 men as a diversion to [[Battle of Cedar Mountain|Cedar Mountain]], where Jackson defeated Pope's subordinate, [[Nathaniel Banks]]. As Lee advanced on Pope with the remainder of his army, Jackson swung around to the north and captured Pope's main supply base at [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas Station]]. Confused and unable to locate the main Confederate force, Pope walked into a trap in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]]. His men withstood a combined attack by Jackson and Lee on August 29, 1862, but on the following day Maj. Gen. [[James Longstreet]] launched a surprise flanking attack and the Union Army was soundly defeated and forced to retreat. Pope compounded his unpopularity with the Army by blaming his defeat on disobedience by Maj. Gen. [[Fitz John Porter]], who was [[Court-martial of Fitz John Porter|found guilty by court-martial and disgraced]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederiksen&quot; /&gt;

Brigadier General [[Alpheus S. Williams]], who served briefly under Pope, held the general in particularly low esteem.  In a letter to his daughter, he wrote:

{{Quotation|&quot;All this is the sequence of Gen. Pope's high sounding manifestoes.  His pompous orders&amp;nbsp;... greatly disgusted his army from the first.  When a general boasts that he will look only on the backs of his enemies, that he takes no care for lines of retreat or bases of supplies; when, in short, from a snug hotel in Washington he issues after-dinner orders to gratify public taste and his own self-esteem, anyone may confidently look for results such as have followed the bungling management of his last campaign&amp;nbsp;... I dare not trust myself to speak of this commander as I feel and believe.  Suffice it to say (for your eye alone) that more insolence, superciliousness, ignorance, and pretentiousness were never combined in one man.  It can with truth be said of him that he had not a friend in his command from the smallest drummer boy to the highest general officer. All hated him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Alpheus S.|title=From the Cannon's Mouth: The Civil War Letters of General Alpheus S. Williams|year=2011|publisher=Literary Licensing, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pope himself was relieved of command on September 12, 1862, and his army was merged into the Army of the Potomac under McClellan. He spent the remainder of the war in the [[Department of the Northwest]] in [[Minnesota]], dealing with the [[Dakota War of 1862]]. His months campaigning in the West paid career dividends because he was assigned to command the [[Military Division of the Missouri]] on January 30, 1865, and received a brevet promotion to major general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] on March 13, 1865, for his service at Island No. 10.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederiksen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher&quot; /&gt;  On June 27, 1865, the War Department issued General Order No. 118 dividing the entire United States, including the states formerly a part of the Confederacy, into five military divisions and 19 subordinate geographical departments.  Major General [[William T. Sherman]] was assigned to command the Division of the Missouri.  Pope then became commander of its Department of the Missouri, replacing Major General [[Grenville M. Dodge]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Shortly after Lee's surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]], Pope wrote a letter to [[Edmund Kirby-Smith]] offering the Confederates in [[Louisiana]] the same surrender terms that Grant allowed for Lee. He told Kirby-Smith that further resistance was futile and urged the general to avoid needless bloodshed, devastation, and misery by accepting the surrender terms. Kirby-Smith, however, rejected Pope's overtures and said that his army remained &quot;strong and well equipped and that despite the 'disparity of numbers' his men could outweigh the differences 'by valor and skill'.&quot; Five weeks later Confederate General [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]] signed the surrender in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;Winters, pp. 421, 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postbellum years==
In April 1867, Pope was named governor of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] [[Third Military District]] and made his headquarters in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], issuing orders that allowed [[African Americans]] to serve on juries, ordering Mayor [[James E. Williams (mayor)|James Williams]] to remain in office another year, postponing elections, and banning city advertising in newspapers that did not favor Reconstruction. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] removed him from command December 28, 1867, replacing him with [[George G. Meade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history3.htm Atlanta city directory website, timeline of Atlanta history.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this, Pope was appointed head of the [[Department of the Lakes]] from January 13, 1868, to April 30, 1870.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Pope returned to the West as commander of the [[Department of the Missouri]] and served with distinction in the [[Apache Wars]]. He made political enemies in Washington when he recommended that the reservation system would be better administered by the military than the corrupt [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Bureau]]. He engendered controversy by calling for better and more humane treatment of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederiksen&quot; /&gt; but author Walter Donald Kennedy notes that he also said &quot;It is my purpose to utterly exterminate the Sioux&quot; and planned to make a &quot;final settlement with all these Indians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;O.R., Series I, Vol. XIII, p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope's reputation suffered a serious blow in 1879 when a Board of Inquiry led by Maj. Gen. [[John Schofield]] concluded that Fitz John Porter had been unfairly convicted and that it was Pope himself who bore most of the responsibility for the loss at the Second Battle of Bull Run. The report characterized Pope as being reckless and dangerously uninformed about the events of the battle, and credited Porter's perceived disobedience with saving the army from complete ruin. Pope was promoted to major general in the Regular Army in 1882, was assigned to command of the [[Military Division of the Pacific]] in 1883, and retired in 1886. He died at the Ohio Soldiers' Home near [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. He is buried in [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher&quot; /&gt;
