[[Major general (Australia)|Major General]] '''Victor Sellheim''' [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (4 May 1866 – 25 January 1928) was an [[Australian]] military officer during the [[Second Boer War]] and [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hill|first=A.J.|chapter=Sellheim, Victor Conradsdorf Morisset (1866–1928)|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|volume=Volume 11|year=1988|chapter-url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/sellheim-victor-conradsdorf-morisset-8385|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra|pages=565–567|isbn=9780522842364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sellheim fought in the [[Second Boer War]] with Chauvel's Mounted Infantry and fought in the [[Battle of Modder River]]. For his actions during the war, Sellheim became a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]]. After serving in a variety of staff positions, he became [[Quartermaster general]] of the [[Australian Military Forces]] in 1912 and two years later was [[Adjutant general]]. Between 1914 and 1916 he oversaw the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] base at [[Cairo]]. He became the Adjutant general again. After the end of [[World War I]], Sellheim became Quartermaster general in 1920 but resigned in 1927 to become [[Administrator of Norfolk Island]], where he died on heart failure in 1928. 

==  Early life ==
Sellheim was born on 4 May 1866 in [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]], the eldest son of Philip Frederic Sellheim and his wife Laura Morriset. He was educated at the [[Brisbane Grammar School]] and was a surveyor afterwards. Sellheim married Susan Howell-Griffith on 7 December 1890.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; He enlisted in the [[Kennedy Regiment]], where he received a [[second lieutenant]]'s commission in 1892 and was promoted to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Major Victor Sellheim|url = http://www.bwm.org.au/site/Victor_Sellheim.asp|website = www.bwm.org.au|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the regimental [[adjutant]], he obtained a permanent [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the [[Queensland Defence Force]] in 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; 

After attending courses in the [[United Kingdom]], Sellheim served in the [[Second Boer War]] as an officer attached to British units and the chief of staff of [[Harry Chauvel]]'s Mounted Infantry, taking part in the [[Battle of Belmont (1899)|Battle of Belmont]] and the [[Battle of Modder River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sir William Glasgow: Soldier, Senator and Diplomat|last = Edgar|first = Peter|publisher = Big Sky Publishing|year = 2011|isbn = 9781921941634|location = Newport|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Australians at the Boer War|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5opzAAAAMAAJ|publisher = Australian War Memorial|date = 1976|isbn = 9780642993915|first = Robert L.|last = Wallace|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later joined the [[Queensland Mounted Infantry]] during the advance on [[Pretoria]]. For his services during the war, Sellheim was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Honours and Awards: Victor Conradsdorf Morisset Sellheim {{!}} Australian War Memorial|url = https://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1508159/|website = www.awm.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[Mentioned in Dispatches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Honours and Awards: Victor Conradsdorf Morisset Sellheim {{!}} Australian War Memorial|url = https://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1508162/|website = www.awm.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Boer War, Sellheim was shifted through various staff appointments and was promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] in December 1909 and appointed the [[Quartermaster General]] to the [[Australian Military Forces]] in 1912. Promoted to [[colonel]] in 1913, he became the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant-General]] in August 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;

== World War I ==
Sellheim served as the head of the administrative staff in the [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]] of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Anzac and Empire: George Foster Pearce and the Foundations of Australian Defence|last = Connor|first = John|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9781107009509|location = Cambridge|pages = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not have a good relationship with his superior, [[Major general (Australia)|Major General]] [[William Bridges (general)|William Bridges]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = To Win the Battle: The 1st Australian Division in the Great War, 1914–18|last = Stevenson|first = Robert C.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2013|isbn = 9781107028685|location = Cambridge|pages = 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result Bridges did not deal directly with Sellheim on administrative matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Sellheim organized a base for the AIF in [[Cairo]] and was promoted to [[Brigadier General (Australia)|brigadier general]] in 1916. AIF Administrative Headquarters was moved to [[England]] in May. Sellheim was replaced by [[Robert Anderson (Australian general)|Robert Anderson]] in August and was sent back to Australia to become the Adjutant General again. He was again mentioned in dispatches &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Honours and Awards: Victor Conradsdorf Morisset Sellheim {{!}} Australian War Memorial|url = https://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1508161/|website = www.awm.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Honours and Awards: Victor Conradsdorf Morisset Sellheim {{!}} Australian War Memorial|url = https://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1508160/|website = www.awm.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Promoted to major general in January 1920, Sellheim became the Quartermaster General as well as the Adjutant General as a result of decreasing defence expenditures due to the end of World War I. He resigned his positions in January 1927 to become the [[List of administrative heads of Norfolk Island|administrator of Norfolk Island]], but died of heart failure on 25 January 1928, and was buried in the cemetery [[Kingston, Norfolk Island]]. Sellheim's maternal grandfather, [[James Thomas Morisset|James Morisset]], had served as commandant of Norfolk from 1829 to 1834.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;
