==Suggestions for page content==
There seems to be as much information about the Douglas family as about the castle in the article.  Personally I'd like to see more about how the sieges went, and it seems there would be room for more about the architecture, and while a date of construction is implied it isn't stated right out.  Not to be a pain in the neck or anything, I just thought I'd mention it in case someone gets inspired.   [[User:Candle-ends|Candle-ends]] 01:01, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

* Separating the design out a bit would also interest me.  It appears this castle has rather large walls and towers involved so any information about the configuration and scale would be helpful.  Listing all that apart from the historical context would be good, even if it is only a few sentences. -- [[User:M0llusk|M0llusk]] 00:56, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

* The reason a date of construction isn't stated righ out is because, as with most castles, it isn't known. [[User:Fionnlaoch|Fionnlaoch]] ([[User talk:Fionnlaoch|talk]]) 16:29, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

== inspiration... ==

I'm creating and adding to loads on on East Lothian, and specifically the North Berwick area at the moment, as you can see from my [[User:Deiz/myedits|extremely vain contributions page]]. I've done lots on Seacliff, Auldhame and Scoughall today so I'll probably get around to editing this at some point. But don't let that stop anyone else from getting stuck in...

: Its all grist to the mill. All factual contributions should be gratefully received. [[User:David Lauder|David Lauder]] 11:57, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

== More photos ==

I've uploaded a few high resolution images to [[Commons:Category:Tantallon Castle]] and there are [http://gallery.mcmillan.net.nz/v/Travels/Scotland07/HistoricPlaces/Tantallon/ more photos here] - leave a note on my talk page if you see any more that you think I should upload.

==Recently==

I'd just like to point out that, a few years ago, there was a pretty major restoration on the gatehouse, that might be worth a mention. As you can see in some of the photos, the grey stone gatehouse front (made of softer stone to make it more resistent to artillery) had worn badly away; all this stone has now been replaced, as you can see in more recent photos of the castle. [[User:Fionnlaoch|Fionnlaoch]] ([[User talk:Fionnlaoch|talk]]) 16:34, 25 June 2008 (UTC)
:Yes you are right. It seems to have been a disturbingly severe intervention, destructive to the monument's historical integrity, and unnecessary for genuine conservation or consolidation reasons given that none of the front fa√ßade of the gateway was at risk of collapse.

== Unreferenced details ==

I removed the following sections, as, despite extensive research. I have been unable to locate references for them:

*When the Lauders were installed as Captains in 1565, the Keeper was [[John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl]].
*The younger Lauder fought on the side of Queen Mary at the [[Battle of Langside]] in 1568, and was replaced by Gavin Hume of Shiells, a younger son of Alexander Hume of [[Polwarth, Scottish Borders|Polwarth]] (d. 1532).

The answers may lie in the following books, listed in the reference section but which I am unable to access:
* ''Historic Manuscripts Commission - MSS of Colonel David Milne-Home of Wedderburn Castle'', London, 1902, p.257.
* ''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', Vol. XI, 1559 - 1566, Edinburgh, 1916, p.lxxi.

Anyone with access to the above please check and re-add the information if possible. Thanks, [[User:Jonathan Oldenbuck|Jonathan Oldenbuck]] ([[User talk:Jonathan Oldenbuck|talk]]) 13:30, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

Not in ''HMC, Wedderburn Castle'', the mentions of Tantallon indexed are of charters signed there. These sound like references collected in &quot;The Grange of St. Giles'' (1898), a book focusing on the Dick-Lauder family.
