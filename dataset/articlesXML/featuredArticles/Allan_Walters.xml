Born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and raised in [[Western Australia]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], before transferring to the RAAF in 1928. He was considered one of the service's leading [[Flight instructor|flying instructors]] and [[aerobatics|aerobatic]] pilots between the wars, and was appointed to his first [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] command in 1937. Over the course of [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War&amp;nbsp;II]], Walters led [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron]] in [[Singapore]], [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Fighter) Wing]] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, [[No. 72 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;72 Wing]] in [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]], and [[Northern Command (RAAF)|Northern Command]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].

Walters was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1946 for his service with Northern Command. Already marked out for senior roles in the post-war RAAF, his positions during the 1950s included [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area Command]], AOC [[RAAF Overseas Headquarters]] in London, Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C., AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Home Command]], [[Air Member for Personnel (Australia)|Air Member for Personnel]], and AOC [[RAAF Support Command|Support Command]].

==Early career==
Allan Leslie Walters was born on 2&amp;nbsp;November 1905 in [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|Ascot Vale]], Victoria, to schoolteacher Ferdinand Walters and his wife Edith. The family soon moved to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Western Australia, and Allan completed his education at Perth Modern School, where he joined the [[Australian Army Cadets|cadets]]. After leaving school and spending eight months in the [[Australian Army Reserve|militia]], he entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in February 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;  At Duntroon he specialised in [[field artillery]], and excelled at athletics.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAFNews&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=34 years service ends|work=RAAF News|date=May 1962|page= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating as a [[lieutenant]] in December 1927, he transferred to the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) on 1&amp;nbsp;February 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=R&amp;VeteranId=1081091|title=Walters, Allan Leslie|work= World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters' preferred career path in the military was engineering, and it was only when he failed to gain selection for this field after his graduation that he applied to transfer to the Air Force, which, having no cadet college of its own, had arranged with Duntroon to take one of its artillery specialists each year for [[Wiktionary:secondment|secondment]] as a pilot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 191–192, 196&lt;/ref&gt; He commenced his course at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria, in mid-1928, and graduated as a [[flying officer]] in March 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother&quot;/&gt; Walters showed an aptitude for instruction, and after further training was graded an 'A1' [[flight instructor]], a rare distinction. Posted to [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, operating [[Westland Wapiti]]s, he also made a name for himself performing [[aerobatics]] at air shows throughout the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;  Walters put this particular talent to use in pursuit of his wife-to-be, Jean Manning, stunt flying above All Saints Church, [[North Parramatta, New South Wales|North Parramatta]], where her father was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]. Reverend Manning married the couple there on 30&amp;nbsp;June 1930; their daughter Robin was born in Richmond.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12637533 |title=Two service wives and a daughter |newspaper=[[The Sun-Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=31 January 1954 |accessdate=22 May 2013 |page=36 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
Walters was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the King's Birthday Honours on 25&amp;nbsp;June 1946, for his &quot;conspicuous service in operations against the Japanese&quot; while leading Northern Command during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00302/003020400.pdf|title= Recommendation: Commander of the Order of the British Empire|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37625|supp=yes|startpage=3217|date=25 June 1946|accessdate=on 12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his term as AOC Northern Command that year, Walters again became Director of Staff Plans and Policy at RAAF Headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAFNews&quot;/&gt; He attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College, London]], in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt; Walters was among a small coterie of highly regarded operational commanders, including Air Commodores [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], [[Frederick Scherger|Fred Scherger]] and Val Hancock, earmarked by the Australian Air Board for senior leadership roles in the post-war RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo24&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 24–27, 73&lt;/ref&gt; In the short term, he remained a temporary air commodore—with the [[Military rank#Types of rank|substantive rank]] of group captain from May 1947—as the officer corps shrank drastically with demobilisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27900305 |title=Promotions in RAAF |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydney |date=30 May 1947 |accessdate=22 May 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected as AOC [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area Command]], hub of the RAAF's training organisation, in March 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22545750 |title=New AOC chosen for Southern Command |newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne  |date=25 March 1948 |accessdate=22 May 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, he flew to [[Morotai]] to preside over a [[court-martial]] for an RAAF airman accused of killing an officer of the Dutch merchant marine; the airman was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article80796006 |title=Court to try airman |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]] |location=Perth |date=7 April 1948 |accessdate=22 May 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59648726 |title=RAAF court martial |newspaper=Centralian Advocate |location=Alice Springs, Northern Territory |date=16 April 1948 |accessdate=22 May 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Walters was considered to be very able, Scherger had long been regarded as outstanding and was &quot;easily the best material on offer&quot; according to a former CAS, Air Marshal [[Donald Hardman|Sir Donald Hardman]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Scherger gained the appointment, and Walters became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 21&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 499–500&lt;/ref&gt; As AMP he occupied a seat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the CAS.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In this role Walters endorsed the recommendations of a review by the AOC Training Command, Air Vice Marshal [[Ian Dougald McLachlan|Ian McLachlan]], that led to a policy of [[RAAF College]] cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the college was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, ''RAAF College &amp; Academy'', pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; Walters served as AMP until August 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;/&gt; The following month he was appointed AOC [[RAAF Support Command|Support Command]], a new organisation created by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAFNews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; When Scherger's term as CAS was due to complete in May 1961, Walters and Hancock were once more put forward to the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Air]] as potential replacements. &quot;Walters was again unlucky&quot;, in the words of Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, Hancock's &quot;professional ability, operational experience and personal qualities&quot; being deemed more appropriate for the role.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Walters left the RAAF on 16&amp;nbsp;May 1962, after completing his posting at Headquarters Support Command.
