[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|GCH|PCi}} (1772 – 3 June 1860) was a [[British Army]] officer and politician. After serving as a junior officer during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], he became Commanding Officer of the Grenadier Battalion of the [[Scots Guards|3rd Regiment of Foot Guards]] during the disastrous [[Walcheren Campaign]]. He served as a brigade commander at the [[Battle of Vitoria]] and then at the [[Battle of Roncesvalles (1813)|Battle of Roncesvalles]] on 25 July 1813 when his brigade took the brunt of the French assault and held its position for three hours in the early morning before finally being forced back. During the [[Hundred Days]] he commanded the 2nd Guards Brigade at the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] in June 1815 and again at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] later that month when light companies from his brigade played an important role in the defence of [[Hougoumont|Château d'Hougoumont]]. He went on to be [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland]] and, after leaving Ireland in 1831, he was elected as [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Poole (UK Parliament constituency)|Poole]] in [[Dorset]] and was one of the few military men who supported the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]], for which he was rewarded with a [[peerage]].

==Early years==
Born was the third son of Major George Byng (son of [[Robert Byng (18th-century MP)|Robert Byng]]) and Anne Byng (née Conolly, a maternal granddaughter of the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|1st Earl of Strafford]] of the first creation), Byng was educated at [[Westminster School]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=4264|title=John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford|last=Stephens|first=H.M.|accessdate=2 February 2014|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|33rd Regiment of Foot]] on 30 September 1793&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13589|supp=|startpage=974|date=2 November 1793|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 1 December 1793&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13628|supp=|startpage=192|date=1 March 1794|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 27 December 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13734|supp=|startpage=1259|date=23 December 1794|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent the [[Netherlands]] later that year and was wounded during a skirmish at [[Geldermalsen]] in January 1795 during the [[Flanders Campaign]].&lt;ref name=heath63&gt;Heathcote 1999, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Byng became [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[Richard William Howard Vyse|Richard Vyse]] in the Southern District of [[Ireland]] in 1796 and was wounded during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].&lt;ref name=heath63/&gt; He became a [[major]] in the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|60th Regiment of Foot]] on 28 December 1799&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15216|supp=|startpage=1331|date=24 December 1799|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[lieutenant-colonel]] in the 29th Regiment of Foot on 18 March 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15239|supp=|startpage=260|date=15 March 1800|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to the [[Scots Guards|3rd Regiment of Foot Guards]] on 11 August 1804&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15726|supp=|startpage=953|date=7 August 1804|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in the expedition to [[Hanover]] in 1805, in the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]] in August 1807 and, having taken command of the Grenadier Battalion of his Regiment, in the disastrous [[Walcheren Campaign]] in Autumn 1809.&lt;ref name=heath63/&gt;

Byng also fought at the [[Battle of Nivelle]] in November 1813 and then at the [[Battle of the Nive]] in December 1813; at the latter battle he led his troops up a hill under fire, occupied it and then planted the colour of the [[31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot|31st Regiment of Foot]] there before driving the French troops down the hill. His conduct  was such that the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] told him that he was {{quote|&quot;permitted to wear over the arms of the family of Byng, in bend sinister, a representation of the colour of the 31st regiment of foot,&quot; and the following crest of honourable augmentation, viz. &quot;out of a mural crown an arm embowed, grasping the colour of the aforesaid 31st regiment, and pendent from the wrist by a ribband the gold cross presented to him by His Majesty's command, as a mark of His royal approbation of his distinguished services&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=17037|supp=|startpage=1358|date=8 July 1815|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
