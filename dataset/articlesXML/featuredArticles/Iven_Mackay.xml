[[Lieutenant general (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] '''Sir Iven Giffard Mackay''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|KBE,|CMG,|DSO2,|VD|size=100}}  (7&amp;nbsp;April 1882 – 30&amp;nbsp;September 1966) was a senior [[Australian Army]] officer who served in both [[World war#World War I and World War II|world wars]].

Mackay graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] in 1904 and taught [[physics]] there from 1910 until 1914, when he joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. He served with the [[4th Battalion (Australia)|4th Infantry Battalion]] at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], where he distinguished himself in hand-to-hand fighting at the [[Battle of Lone Pine]]. In April 1916, he assumed command of the 4th Infantry Battalion on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and led it at the [[Battle of Pozières]], [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Bullecourt]] and [[Battle of Broodseinde]]. He was promoted to [[brigadier general]] in June 1918, and led the [[1st Brigade (Australia)|1st Infantry Brigade]] at the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of Hazebrouck]], the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] and in the attack on the [[Hindenburg Line]].

After the war, Mackay studied physics at the [[University of Cambridge]] under [[Ernest Rutherford]] before returning to Australia and his old job as a lecturer at the University of Sydney. From 1933 to 1940 he was headmaster of [[Cranbrook School, Sydney]]. He remained in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] between the wars, and was a [[Major general (Australia)|major general]] by the time the Second World War broke out. He was selected to command the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]] in 1940, and led it through the Australian Army's first battles of the war. Any doubts about his ability soon disappeared with the commitment of the division to the [[Operation Compass|Western Desert Campaign]]. During the [[Battle of Bardia]] in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. In the [[Battle of Greece]], he became the only Australian general to face the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' in battle. He suffered a series of reverses in Greece, but impressed the troops under his command with his courage under fire. He was recalled to Australia in 1941 to serve as [[General Officer Commanding]] Home Forces. On 6 April 1942, he assumed command of the [[Second Army (Australia)|Second Army]]. During 1943 he twice commanded [[New Guinea Force]] in the fighting in the [[New Guinea campaign]]. His active service ended with his appointment as [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] to India in November 1943.

==Early life and career==
Iven Giffard Mackay&lt;ref&gt;The G in Giffard is soft, as in &quot;general&quot;. {{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Grafton, New South Wales]], on 7 April 1882. The eldest of three children, he was the only son of [[the Reverend]] Isaac Mackay, a [[Presbyterian]] minister from [[Armadale, Sutherland]], Scotland, and his Canadian wife Emily Frances, née King.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Grey|2000|pp=235–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iven was educated at Grafton Superior Public School, [[Newington College]], and the [[University of Sydney]],&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; where he opened the batting for the university's cricket team, and won [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] for [[rugby union]] football and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]]. He graduated with his [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree in 1904.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, p. 7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackay had served in the Newington College [[Australian Army Cadets|cadet unit]], reaching the rank of [[sergeant]] and winning a trophy in 1899 for being the school's best rifle shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, p. 7&quot;/&gt; In 1911, he became a [[lieutenant]] in the Cadet Corps. On 20 March 1913, he transferred to the Militia as a lieutenant. In July he became the [[adjutant]] of the [[26th Battalion (Australia)|26th Infantry Battalion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;/&gt; which was commanded by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Normand MacLaurin|Henry MacLaurin]]. As part of his training, he attended the [[School of Musketry]] in [[Randwick, New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, p. 10&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]] on 1 June 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Army List of Officers of the Australian Military Forces | year = 1945 |page=2  |location=Melbourne |publisher=Australian Military Forces | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay joined [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School]] in 1905, teaching various subjects and coaching the rowing and rugby teams. In 1910 he returned to the University of Sydney to teach [[physics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, p. 8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1913 to 1914, he studied for a Diploma of Military Science course at the University of Sydney.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, p. 10&quot; /&gt;

==First World War==
Mackay joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on 27 August 1914 as adjutant of the [[4th Battalion (Australia)|4th Infantry Battalion]], with the rank of captain.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;/&gt; On 4 September 1914, he married his fiancée, Marjorie Eveline Meredith, the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel [[John Meredith (general)|John Meredith]], in a ceremony at St Philip's Church, Sydney.  The couple had met while Mackay was on holiday in [[Paterson, New South Wales]], in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1914, Mackay suffered a riding accident and was taken to [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]] with a punctured lung and broken ribs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury forced him to miss the scheduled embarkation of his battalion. He sailed for Egypt with the 1st Reinforcements of the [[13th Battalion (Australia)|13th Infantry Battalion]], departing Sydney on the transport {{ship|HMAT|Berrima||2}} on 19 December 1914, arriving at [[Alexandria]] on 31 January 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then posted back to the 4th Infantry Battalion as the Transport Officer. He observed the [[landing at Gallipoli]] from the transport SS ''Lake Michigan'', but did not go ashore with the battalion, as his job was to take care of the horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He re-joined the battalion on shore on 8 May 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; Heavy casualties in the early fighting had depleted the officer ranks and Mackay was promoted to [[major]] on 14 July 1915, and given command of a [[Company (military unit)|company]] in August.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;/&gt;

===Gallipoli===
On 6 August 1915, Mackay was involved in the [[Battle of Lone Pine]]. When the attack began, Mackay went over the top at the head of an attack. He ignored the first Turkish trench, taking a direct line to his objective. Firing from the hip, he shot and killed several Turks in the trenches below. Mackay positioned himself at the junction of two trenches, shooting down more enemy troops. When no others appeared, he came to the belief that the trenches were in Australian hands and ran across the junction into a wide bay. The first man who attempted to follow was shot dead, as were the next two after him. The rest decided not to follow. Mackay took up a position on a fire step, a raised part of the trench floor which allows men to fire over the top. Three Turkish soldiers appeared in the trench. Mackay attempted to fire but his magazine was empty. He lunged at the Turks, grazing one and making all three run. Mackay then instructed his party to fortify the position with sandbags. As the barricade was built up, it became possible for the rest of the party to join Mackay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=511–512}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post became the north eastern corner of the new Australian position at Lone Pine. It was in an exposed position and came under hand grenade attack from Turkish troops. Mackay was slightly injured in one such attack. When Lieutenant [[Jack Massie]] was sent to relieve Mackay during the night, Mackay refused to leave the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=533–534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the next day, Mackay realised that the position could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied with the security of the new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1924|p=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay's injuries were severe enough for him to be evacuated to [[Malta]] and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the [[Victoria Cross]]. He was overlooked for the award,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|2012|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he was later [[mentioned in despatches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mid1&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29455|supp=yes|startpage=1208|date=28 January 1916|accessdate=7 November 2009}} ''(Mentioned in Despatches – Gallipoli)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Front===
Mackay sailed for France on 20 March 1916 on the transport ''Minnewaska'' as part of the Advance Party of the [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 1916, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the 4th Infantry Battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;/&gt; He led it at the [[Battle of Pozières]] in July, where it was involved in the capture of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, a famous incident occurred:
:{{quote|Colonels Stevens and Mackay had left their headquarters and walked forward up Dead Man's Road (the sunken end of the Chalk Pit road) to its junction with the main road for the purpose of making hurried plans for the advance of their men, and instructing the company commanders. As they stood at this desolate corner (the most actively shelled in Pozières), surrounded by shredded tree-trunks and the dead, a panting messenger stumbled up to them with an envelope marked &quot;Urgent and Secret&quot;. They hurriedly tore it open. The message read: &quot;A number of cases have lately occurred of men failing to salute the army commander when passing in his car, in spite of the fact that the car carries his flag upon the bonnet. This practice must cease.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1929|p=537}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
For his part in the battle, Mackay was mentioned in despatches a second time.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid2&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29890|supp=yes|startpage=254|date=4 January 1917|accessdate=7 November 2009}} ''(Mentioned in Despatches – Western Front)''&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his gallantry at Lone Pine, his part in the capture of Pozières, and his role in repelling a German counterattack at [[Battle of Mouquet Farm|Mouquet Farm]], near Pozières.&lt;ref name=&quot;dso1&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29886|supp=yes|startpage=28|date=1 January 1917|accessdate=7 November 2009}} ''(Distinguished Service Order)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=412066 |accessdate=16 October 2012 |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |title=Honours and Awards – Iven Giffard Mackay – Recommended: Distinguished Service Order }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mackay and McKenzie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Informal portrait of Lieutenant Colonel I. G. Mackay DSO (''left''), Commanding Officer of the 4th Infantry Battalion, AIF, with his Adjutant, Lieutenant L. A. McKenzie, at Samer|alt=Two officers stand on the steps of a French Chateau.]]
Mackay held the temporary position of commander of the [[1st Brigade (Australia)|1st Infantry Brigade]] in January 1917, for the first of what would be five times totalling 92 days in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded the 4th Infantry Battalion in the advance to the [[Hindenburg Line]], including the capture of the fortified town of [[Hermies]]. During the German counter-attack at [[Battle of Arras (1917)#Battle of Lagnicourt (15 April 1917)|Lagnicourt]] in April 1917 his battalion held its positions, repulsing the Germans with heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting brigade commander again during the [[Second Battle of Bullecourt]] in May, Mackay was mentioned in despatches for the third time,&lt;ref name=&quot;mid3&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30448|supp=yes|startpage=13566|date=31 December 1917|accessdate=7 November 2009}} ''(Mentioned in Despatches – Bullecourt)''&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded a [[medal bar|bar]] to his Distinguished Service Order. His citation read:
:{{quote|For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. While acting as brigadier, when the brigade on the right was broken into by the enemy, the battalion under his orders counter-attacked and assisted to drive out the enemy and restore the position. His action in repelling the counter-attack was of the utmost value, and his prompt action and extreme resolution showed leadership of a high order.&lt;ref name=&quot;dso2&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30135|supp=yes|startpage=5980|date=18 June 1917|accessdate=7 November 2009}} ''(Distinguished Service Order – bar)''&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Along with [[Brigadier General]] [[Gordon Bennett (general)|H. Gordon Bennett]] and others, Mackay received personal congratulations from [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]]. He later received his medals from King [[George V]] in a ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay led his battalion once more at the [[Battle of Broodseinde]], earning a fourth mention in despatches.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid4&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31089|supp=yes|startpage=15225|date=28 December 1918|accessdate=7 November 2009}} ''(Mentioned in Despatches – Broodseinde)''&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1918, the four machine gun companies in each division were grouped into machine gun battalions. Mackay was given command of the [[1st Machine Gun Battalion (Australia)|1st Machine Gun Battalion]], the 1st Division's new battalion, which he led in the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of Hazebrouck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] rank of major in the 26th Infantry Battalion in the AMF back home on 3 June 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;/&gt; 
 
On 6 June 1918, Mackay was heading on leave to London to visit his wife, who had managed to reach England after a long battle with wartime travel restrictions, when he was stopped and turned back at [[Boulogne]] by [[Royal Military Police|British military police]]. He had been appointed to command the 1st Infantry Brigade and had to return at once. He was immediately promoted to [[colonel]] and temporary [[brigadier general]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay commanded the 1st Infantry Brigade in the later stages of the fighting around Hazebrouck. In the operations east of there in June and July, his brigade was exceptionally active in the form of minor operations and patrolling that became known as the [[peaceful penetration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, the 1st Division moved south to the Somme sector to participate in the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] and later the attack on the Hindenburg Line.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; Through his &quot;careful preliminary preparations and sound tactical knowledge&quot;, Mackay contributed to the successes of his brigade and was once more mentioned in despatches.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid5&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31488|supp=yes|startpage=8827|date=11 July 1919|accessdate=7 November 2009}} ''(Mentioned in Despatches – Amiens)''&lt;/ref&gt; For his service as a brigade commander, he was appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) in the [[1919 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cmg&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31092|supp=yes|startpage=5|date=1 January 1919|accessdate=7 November 2009}}  ''(Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George)''&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded the French [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de guerre]] for his service on the Western Front.&lt;ref name=&quot;croix&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31109|supp=yes|startpage=313|date=7 January 1919|accessdate=7 November 2009}} ''(Croix de guerre)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the wars==
[[File:Lieutenant and Mrs W. H. Travers.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Lieutenant W. H. Travers and Mrs. Jean Margaret Travers, son-in-law and daughter of Major General Iven Mackay, January 1941|alt=Formal portrait of a couple]]
After the end of the war, Mackay took advantage of Brigadier General [[George Long (bishop)|George Long]]'s education scheme to study physics at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] under [[Ernest Rutherford]]. His first child, Jean Margaret, was born in [[Cambridge]] in 1919. Iven and Marjorie later had two more children, a son, Iven John, born in Sydney in 1920, and another daughter, Alison, born in Sydney in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They returned to Australia aboard the transport ''Mantua'', which reached Sydney on 19 February 1920. With the war over, the AIF was demobilised, and Mackay's appointment to the AIF was terminated on 4 April 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay returned to lecturing in physics at the University of Sydney. Between 1922 and 1932, he was student adviser. From 1925 he was also faculty secretary.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; From 1932 to 1940, Mackay also worked evenings as a Commonwealth Film Appeals Censor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, he was appointed headmaster of [[Cranbrook School, Sydney]]. The school's constitution was changed to allow Mackay, a Presbyterian, to hold the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of a case of mistaken identity following the death of [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[James Mackay (Australian politician)|James Mackay]] in 1935, Mackay got to read his own obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', entitled &quot;Athlete, Soldier and Headmaster&quot;. He normally avoided publicity, but this incident brought him to national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackay remained active in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] throughout the inter-war period. He held the rank of honorary brigadier general from 21 January 1920 to late June 1937, when he was promoted to that rank substantively. He commanded the [[9th Brigade (Australia)|9th Infantry Brigade]] from 1 July 1920 to 30 April 1921, the [[8th Brigade (Australia)|8th Infantry Brigade]] from 1 May 1921 to 30 April 1926 and the [[5th Brigade (Australia)|5th Infantry Brigade]] from 1 May 1930 to 31 December 1932. On 24 March 1937, he took command of the [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]]. He was promoted to major general on 1 July 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;/&gt; Mackay was one of only four Militia officers to be substantively promoted to that rank between 1929 and 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horner|1998|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His term of office at Cranbrook ended acrimoniously after Justice [[Kenneth Street (jurist)|Kenneth Street]] and others blamed Mackay for the school's slow recovery from the [[Great Depression]], and the school council voted to remove him on 25 October 1939. Mackay was given twelve months' notice. When, in December 1939, Mackay's daughter Jean married Lieutenant W. H. Travers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, pp. 143–145&quot;/&gt; the grandson of Major General [[William Holmes (Australian general)|William Holmes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1952|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reception was held at Cranbrook.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, pp. 143–145&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=143–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==

Back row, left to right: Colonel [[Frank Berryman]], Brigadier [[Stanley Savige]], Colonel [[George Alan Vasey|Alan Vasey]]]]
At the outbreak of war in 1939, Mackay was ranked seventh on the army's seniority list.&lt;ref name=&quot;Long, p. 43&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1952|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following formation of a second infantry division for the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] in 1940, [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] was elevated to command of the newly created [[Australian I Corps|I Corps]]. Mackay was selected to command the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] on the advice of [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Brudenell White]] but [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]], after consulting with Blamey, switched this appointment to the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Long, p. 84&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1952|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay assumed command on 4 April 1940,&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;/&gt; receiving the serial number NX363,&lt;ref name=&quot;Long, p. 43&quot;/&gt; and sailed from [[Melbourne]] for the Middle East on the [[ocean liner]] [[RMS Strathaird|RMS ''Strathaird'']] on 15 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The troops nicknamed him &quot;Mr Chips&quot;, after the title character of the best selling 1934 novel ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' and the subsequent [[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|1939 film]], a reference to his peacetime profession, but also to the impression he gave of being cool, reserved and strict. Some of his staff had reservations about him. Colonel [[George Alan Vasey|Alan Vasey]], his Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General, asserted that Mackay lacked the ruthlessness to remove Militia officers who were not performing well.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; Vasey fumed about &quot;that bloody schoolteacher who wants to dot every 'i' and cross every 't'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, p. 165&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many regular officers were embittered by years of slow promotion followed by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Menzies]] ordering that commands in the 6th Division be given to Militia officers. Colonel [[Frank Berryman]] considered this &quot;a damn insult to the professional soldier, calculated to split the Army down the centre. We were to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water. We, the only people who really knew the job, were to assist these Militia fellows&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berryman, who worked closely with Mackay as his chief of staff, held him in high regard. &quot;For moral and physical courage&quot;, said Berryman, &quot;few equalled him—none ever surpassed him. He was an educated and most knowledgeable soldier&amp;nbsp;... and extremely patient&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, p. 166&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Commander, Royal Australian Artillery, a reservist, [[Brigadier]] [[Edmund Herring]], considered Mackay &quot;a most competent and able commander in North Africa and Greece, but a bit old&amp;nbsp;... Modest, dignified, shy and scholarly&amp;nbsp;... In action he never knew the meaning of fear&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, p. 165&quot; /&gt;

===Libya===
His appointment to command the 6th Division meant that Mackay led its—and the Australian Army's—first battles of the war. Doubts about Mackay's ability soon disappeared with the commitment of the division to [[Operation Compass]]. During the [[Battle of Bardia]], in [[Libya]] in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stockings|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this success, Mackay was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE).&lt;ref name=&quot;kbe&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35094|startpage=1304|date=4 March 1941|accessdate=7 November 2009}} ''(Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire)''&lt;/ref&gt; In a war of rapid movement over long distances, Mackay demonstrated careful planning and recognised the need to reinforce success.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; He also impressed others with the way he cared for soldiers' lives. &quot;Not only do I want Tobruk quickly&quot;, he told his brigadiers before the battle, &quot;but I also want it cheaply&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victory at Bardia was followed by successes at [[Tobruk]], [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] and [[Benghazi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=200–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
[[File:AWM 007647 vevi.jpg|thumb|left|Australian anti-tank gunners resting, soon after their withdrawal from the Vevi area|alt=Four soldiers, dressed warmly with three of them wearing steel helmets, in front of a 2 pounder anti tank gun]]
The 6th Division's next campaign was the failed [[Battle of Greece]], a disaster for the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] forces sent there. While in Greece, Mackay led a hastily assembled Australian-British-New Zealand-Greek formation known as Mackay Force, defending the [[Klidi Pass]] at the [[Battle of Vevi (1941)|Battle of Vevi]]. The Allies were forced to retreat in a fierce assault by the ''[[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]]'' brigade. Mackay was the only Australian general to face the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1953|pp=56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in Libya, Mackay shared the hardships of living in the field with his men, and impressed them by his coolness during air raids. They watched him sit in the open during attacks; on one such occasion on 19 April 1941, Mackay waited out a two-and-a-half-hour raid when his car was hit and his driver wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1953|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; One staff officer &quot;noticed Mackay moving in front of his tent quite unconcerned about the movement of enemy planes. He neither looked at the planes nor at the men dashing about, but they saw him, and those moving towards shelter stopped, and many of those who had gained shelter returned to their duties. Personal example is the only paying proposition in such circumstances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1953|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his actions in Greece, he was mentioned in despatches a sixth time,&lt;ref name=&quot;mid6&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35396|startpage=7357|date=30 December 1941|accessdate=7 November 2009}} ''(Mentioned in Despatches – Greece)''&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded the [[Greek War Cross]] (First Class).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Honours and Awards – Iven Giffard Mackay |publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]] |url= http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=346898 |accessdate= 12 November 2009 }} ''(Greek War Cross)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Casualties in Greece included Mackay's son-in-law, Captain W. H. Travers, who was captured in the [[Battle of Crete]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman 1975 155&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay resolved to reform the battalions that had been destroyed in Greece, and to rebuild his shattered division from the remnants that had been evacuated to Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a training program in Syria in which he attempted to apply the lessons of the campaign in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1953|p=537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence of Australia===
[[File:Lt Iven John Mackay 1941 005054.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Lieutenant Iven John Mackay, January 1941|alt=Formal portrait of a young man in Australian Army uniform]]
One lesson of Greece was that modern war was a young man's trade. Brigadier [[Sydney Rowell]] recommended to Blamey that all generals over the age of 50 be retired.&lt;!-- NB: Blamey over age 50 --&gt; In July 1941, Ernest Turnbull, representing the motion picture industry, approached Menzies and several members of his Cabinet about the possibility of Mackay becoming Chief Commonwealth Film Censor. Menzies had a different post in mind. On 24 July 1941 the [[War Cabinet]] decided to appoint a [[General Officer Commanding]] Home Forces. In a cable to Blamey, Menzies stipulated that the War Cabinet wanted a high-ranking officer like Mackay with active service in the current war. Blamey replied that he considered &quot;Mackay most suitable for the appointment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 1941, Mackay handed over command of the 6th Division to Herring. Mackay departed [[Cairo]] for Australia by [[flying boat]] on 22 August. En route, he stopped in [[Singapore]] to confer with Bennett, now the commander of the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]], which was based there, and had dinner at the [[Raffles Hotel]] with his son, Lieutenant Iven Mackay, an officer with the 8th Division's [[2/18th Battalion (Australia)|2/18th Infantry Battalion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackay assumed command of Home Forces on 1 September 1941, with the rank of lieutenant general. His task was to prepare the Militia to repel a [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|Japanese invasion]]. Official historian [[Dudley McCarthy]] noted that:
:{{quote|If Mackay had been in any way deceived by the grandiloquence of his new title his illusions were soon dissipated when he assumed command on 1 September. Initially there was reluctance to grant him the substantive promotion he had been promised. He found that his authority did not extend over the forward areas of [[New Guinea]] and the [[Northern Territory]]; nor was he to be responsible for &quot;the defence of Australia&quot; as such, as this responsibility remained with General [[Vernon Sturdee|Sturdee]], the [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]]. In short his command was far more circumscribed than he might have expected, with the added disadvantage of calling for a political finesse to the possession of which he laid few claims. He was a gallant and successful soldier, with a long record of distinguished service to his country, and a man of instinctive and unassuming courtesy. But neither his qualities of character and temperament nor the academic seclusion of his life between the wars fitted him well for the role of a senior military adviser to a Cabinet inexperienced in military affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarthy|1959|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the [[Fall of Singapore]] in February 1942, Mackay's son Iven became a [[prisoner of war]] of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman 1975 155&quot;/&gt; A Japanese invasion of Australia now became a real possibility, so Mackay submitted a contingency plan in which he outlined a defence strategy whereby the army would concentrate on the defence of the most vital areas of eastern and southern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarthy|1959|pp=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later gave rise to the controversial but mythical &quot;[[Brisbane Line]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=283–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular officers took the opportunity to give Mackay petty snubs. Army Headquarters continually addressed him as &quot;major general&quot;, although his promotion to lieutenant general had been gazetted, and his pay was only £1,564 compared with Sturdee's £2,269.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; His AIF serial number was taken away from him and he was sent a new recruit's papers to fill in. The Military Board even attempted to bring him before a medical board to decide his fitness for further service. Only the intervention of the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for the Army]], [[Frank Forde]], averted this.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a sweeping reorganisation of the army by Blamey, Mackay became commander of the [[Second Army (Australia)|Second Army]] on 6 April 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarthy|1959|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Guinea===
[[File:Mackay and Blamey.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lieutenant General Sir Iven Mackay (''right'') meets with General Sir Thomas Blamey (''left'')|alt=Two soldiers in khaki uniforms and slouch hats]]
When Blamey relieved Rowell of command of I Corps in New Guinea, he nominated Herring as successor. Blamey proposed Mackay as a second choice but preferred Herring as he was much younger, and this was important in the taxing New Guinea climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=239317&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1 |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |title=Blamey for Prime Minister and General MacArthur, 26 September 1942, NAA (ACT) A5954 266/1 |accessdate=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Blamey relinquished command of [[New Guinea Force]] on 30 January 1943, he handed over temporary command to Mackay to enable Herring to go on leave. The period was a quiet one, with no major operations being carried out, and Mackay handed back to Herring and returned to command of the Second Army at [[Parramatta, New South Wales]], in May 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=272–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 1943, Mackay once again assumed command of New Guinea Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;/&gt; This time, important operations were being undertaken in the [[Battle of Finschhafen]] and Mackay's period of command was marred by disagreements with [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s staff over the reinforcement of Finschhafen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=278–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Junior commanders felt that Mackay should have been more forceful, and should have enlisted the help of his superior, Blamey, at an earlier stage. Blamey agreed with them, feeling that his old colleague was slowing down, and no longer possessed the vigour required for the campaign in New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=280–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coates|1999|pp=140–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay left New Guinea in November 1943, handing over command of New Guinea Force to Lieutenant General Sir [[Leslie Morshead]], and on 20 January 1944 Mackay relinquished command of Second Army and New Guinea Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;/&gt;

===India===
In November 1943, it was announced that Prime Minister [[John Curtin]], with Blamey's approval, had appointed Mackay as [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Iven and Lady Mackay sailed from [[Perth]], on SS ''Tanda'' on 14 February 1944. Their arrival in [[Delhi]] marked the beginning of an Australian diplomatic presence in India. When Lieutenant Iven Mackay was liberated, the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] of [[South East Asia Command]], [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]] had him brought to Delhi to be reunited with his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, pp. 293-301&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=293–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the war's end, Mackay retired from the army on 27 February 1946, and the post of High Commissioner gradually became a civilian one.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; India was not yet independent, but was about to become so, and Mackay met with future leaders [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman, pp. 293-301&quot;/&gt; Mackay and the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for External Affairs]], Dr [[H. V. Evatt]], supported Indian independence, while expressing the hope that India would remain in the British Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/historical/HistDocs.nsf/d30d79e4ab5621f9ca256c8600163c0d/17e742aea0cf2269ca256b7e007938f2?OpenDocument |title=Note by Mackay of Conversation with Evatt |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] |accessdate=12 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay also promoted trade between India and Australia, and fostered a plan for Indian students and technicians to study and train in Australia. His term as high commissioner ended in May 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt;

==Post war==
Mackay was approached to consider nomination as a [[Liberal Party of Australia]] candidate for the [[Australian Senate]], but declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he accepted a directorship of Australian Cotton Textile Industries. From 1950 to 1952, he chaired the New South Wales recruiting committee which was set up by the Federal government to increase enlistment in the armed forces. The University of Sydney appointed Mackay an honorary [[Esquire Bedell]] in 1950 and awarded him an [[honorary degree]] of [[Doctor of Laws]] in 1952. When Blamey died in 1951, Mackay rushed to Melbourne to be one of his [[pallbearer]]s. Mackay visited Greece in 1952 for the unveiling of a memorial to British Commonwealth servicemen who died in the 1941 campaign. In 1961, he returned for the dedication of the Commonwealth War Cemetery at [[Faliro]]. This time he also revisited the Gallipoli battlefields, sailing to the [[Dardanelles]] on {{ship|HMY|Britannia}} as a guest of Field Marshal [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]]. Mackay climbed from the beach at [[ANZAC Cove]] up to Lone Pine once more. When it became known that he was visiting the United States in 1961, the US Army took him to see [[Fort Sill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|pp=303–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackay died at his home in [[East Lindfield, New South Wales]], on 30 September 1966 and was cremated after a service at [[St. Stephen's Uniting Church|St Stephen's]], Sydney. He was survived by his wife, his son and his two daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; Veterans lined the streets and he had ten generals for his pallbearers: [[Edmund Herring|Herring]], [[Eric Woodward|Woodward]], [[Jack Stevens|Stevens]], [[Beauchamp Worters Pulver|Pulver]], [[John Rowlstone Stevenson|Stevenson]], [[Denzil Macarthur-Onslow|Macarthur-Onslow]], [[Ivan Dougherty|Dougherty]], [[Eric Fairweather Harrison|Harrison]], [[Paul Cullen (general)|Cullen]] and [[Frederick Galleghan|Galleghan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|1975|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay's papers and portraits are held in the [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackay's papers and portraits held at the [[Australian War Memorial]]:
