'''No. 450 Squadron''' was a unit of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) that operated during World War&amp;nbsp;II. Established at [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAAF Station Williamtown]], New South Wales, in February 1941, it was the first Australian [[Article XV squadron]] formed under the [[Empire Air Training Scheme]].

The squadron embarked for the Middle East in April 1941; its personnel initially consisted solely of ground crew, who joined the pilots of [[No. 260 Squadron RAF]] to form No. 260/450 Squadron, which briefly operated [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters in [[Syria–Lebanon Campaign|Syria]]. It was not until February 1942 that No. 450 Squadron, now with its own pilots and equipped with [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, commenced operations in earnest. Over the next 15 months, it fought in the [[North Africa Campaign|North African]] and [[Tunisian Campaign]]s in both [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] and [[fighter-bomber]] roles, claiming 49 German and Italian aircraft destroyed in the air and earning the nickname &quot;The Desert Harassers&quot;.

Beginning in July 1943, No. 450 Squadron took part in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] and the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]], primarily in the [[Close air support|close support]] role. Its aircraft attacked targets in [[Yugoslavia]] as well as in Sicily and Italy. The squadron began converting from Kittyhawks to [[North American P-51 Mustang]] fighters in May 1945, but never saw action with its new aircraft. It was disbanded in August 1945 following the conclusion of hostilities, having suffered 63 fatal casualties during the war. Today, by agreement with the RAAF, the squadron's number is carried by a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] unit, [[450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron]].

==History==
No. 450 Squadron was formed at [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAAF Station Williamtown]], near [[Newcastle, New South Wales]], on 7 February 1941. Raised a week before [[No. 451 Squadron RAAF|No. 451 Squadron]], it was the first Australian squadron established for service with the British military under the [[Article XV squadron|Article XV]] of the [[Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS).{{sfn|Barnes|2000|pp=250, 255}}{{sfn|Eather|1995|pp=103, 105}} No. 450 Squadron was intended to be an &quot;infiltration&quot; squadron, which would consist initially only of ground crew and would receive a nucleus of experienced pilots after arriving in its designated theatre of operations.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=105}}

Inaugurated at [[Ottawa]], Canada, in October 1939, EATS was a plan to expand the [[Royal Air Force]]'s (RAF) capacity to train aircrews by creating a pool of personnel from various Commonwealth countries—Australia, Canada, Britain and New Zealand—through the establishment of a common training system consisting of a series of initial, elementary, and advanced training schools. At the conclusion of advanced training, personnel were posted as required to RAF-controlled squadrons in Britain or the Middle East. These squadrons were designated as either RAF, RAAF, [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] or [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] squadrons, but were paid for and administered by the British government, and personnel could be drawn from any Commonwealth nation. Seventeen RAAF squadrons were formed during the war under Article XV of the agreement.{{sfn|Gillison|1962|pp=79–89}}{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=3}}

===Middle East and North Africa===
Under the temporary command of [[Flight Lieutenant]] Bruce Shepherd,{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=254}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077918.asp |publisher=Australian War Memorial |title=Squadron Leader Bruce McRae Shepherd |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No. 450 Squadron left Australia on 11 April 1941, embarking on the troopship [[RMS Queen Elizabeth|''Queen Elizabeth'']] at Sydney, and arriving in Egypt on 3 May.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=250}}{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|pp=105–106}} At [[Abu Suwayr Air Base|RAF Abu Sueir]], Squadron Leader [[Gordon Steege]] took command of the squadron before it was combined with the pilots and [[Hawker Hurricane]]s of [[No. 260 Squadron RAF]], which had been established without ground crew, to form an operational squadron.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=250}}{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=103}} The combined unit, known as No. 260/450 (Hurricane) Squadron, then relocated to [[Amman]] in Transjordan. Its first operation was on 29 June 1941, when the Hurricanes attacked [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] airfields and infrastructure during the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|invasion of Syria]].{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=106}} No. 260/450 Squadron operated for ten days only and flew 61 sorties against airfields, 20 on offensive patrols and six on bomber-escort duties during the Syrian campaign.{{sfn|Herington|1954|p=95}}

In August 1941, No. 450 Squadron personnel were separated from No. 260 Squadron, when the latter received its own ground crew. No. 450 Squadron moved to [[Rayak Air Base|Rayak airfield]], Lebanon, where it was allocated Hurricanes and [[Miles Magister]] trainers.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=250}} A batch of 20 trainee Australian, British and Canadian pilots—the majority being Australian—were posted to the squadron in early October, and it began duties as an Operational Training Unit.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=103}}{{sfn|Barnes|2000|pp=250–251}} A fortnight later these pilots were posted out and, lacking trained pilots, the squadron's aircraft were re-allocated. On 20 October, the squadron moved to [[Borg El Arab Airport|Burg El Arab]], Egypt, and began operating as an advanced repair, salvage and service unit, taking part in the [[North African Campaign]].&lt;ref name=AWM450Sqn/&gt;{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=251}}

[[File:450 Sqn (AWM 024694).jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|Kittyhawks of No. 450 Squadron in the Western Desert, North Africa, August 1942|alt=Fighter aircraft parked in the desert]]
By December 1941, the squadron was receiving pilots and it began taking delivery of [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=251}}{{sfn|Herington|1954|p=218}} On 19 December, RAF Middle East Command issued an administrative instruction declaring that although manned primarily by Australians, Nos. 450 and 451 Squadrons were &quot;paid by and loaned to the Royal Air Force under the Empire Air Training Scheme and for all practical purposes they should be regarded as R.A.F. squadrons in every way&quot;. Confusion reigned for a time, but after intervention by the British [[Air Ministry]], a further communique on 23 January 1942 announced that &quot;450 and 451 E.A.T.S. Squadrons are to be regarded as R.A.A.F. squadrons&quot;.{{sfn|Herington|1954|pp=120–121}} Training began the same month, and No. 450 Squadron commenced operations from [[RAF Gambut]] on 19 February 1942, with an uneventful patrol near [[Tobruk]]. Three days later Sergeant Raymond Shaw became the first pilot from the squadron to claim an aerial victory, after he intercepted a [[Junkers Ju 88]] near [[Gazala]].{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=103}}{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=106}}

The squadron became part of the [[Desert Air Force]]'s newly formed No. 239 Wing on 1 March 1942, serving alongside one Australian squadron, [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3]], and two RAF squadrons, [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|Nos. 112]] and [[No. 250 Squadron RAF|250 Squadrons]].{{sfn|Thomas|2005|p=46}} No. 450 Squadron's main roles—escorting daylight raids by [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Boston]] bombers, and ground-attack missions in support of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]—were hazardous and resulted in relatively heavy losses.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=259}} From 26 May, as [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] launched an [[Battle of Gazala|assault on the Gazala–Bir Hacheim line]], all Kittyhawk units began to focus on the [[fighter-bomber]] role rather than air-to-air combat, to support retreating Commonwealth forces.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=115}}{{sfn|Shores|Ring|1969|pp=114–115}} On 29 May, No. 450 Squadron claimed two [[Junkers Ju 87]]s and a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], for the loss of three pilots killed, including Shaw.{{sfn|Shores|Ring|1969|p=116}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|pp=117–118}} Flight Sergeant [[Don McBurnie]], the squadron's highest-scoring pilot with five solo victories and one shared, claimed his final &quot;kill&quot; on 4 July 1942 when he shot a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] into the sea following a bombing mission on airfields west of [[RAF El Daba|Daba]].{{sfn|Brown|1983|pp=139–140, 263}}{{sfn|Shores|Ring|1969|pp=140, 240}}

No. 450 Squadron took part in the decisive [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], during October and November 1942, attacking enemy airfields and claiming three German and Italian fighters destroyed in the air.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=108}}  It suffered several losses during this time, including one of its leading scorers, Squadron Leader [[John Edwin Ashley Williams|John Williams]], who was shot down and taken prisoner on 31 October 1942, three days after he had been appointed commanding officer.&lt;ref name=AWMWilliams&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077919.asp |publisher=Australian War Memorial |title=Squadron Leader John Edwin Ashley Williams, DFC |accessdate=6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Barnes|2000|pp=251–252}} The squadron was frequently on the move as the Allies advanced following Second El Alamein, changing locations six times during November.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=103}}{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=108}} It often found itself using captured or hastily constructed airfields; one Kittyhawk was destroyed and several ground personnel killed or wounded by [[land mine]]s at [[Marble Arch (Libya)|Marble Arch]], Libya, in December 1942.{{sfn|Eather|1995|pp=103–104}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raaf.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/450sqn.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001224431/http://www.raaf.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/450sqn.htm |title= No 450 Squadron |publisher=RAAF Museum Point Cook |archivedate=1 October 2009 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From late 1942, No. 450 Squadron was engaged in the [[Tunisian Campaign]]. By March 1943, as the Allied forces advanced, the squadron was operating from Medinne along the [[Mareth Line]]. That month it flew over 300 sorties. Further moves occurred, and by mid-April it was based at Karouan. Throughout April and early May, 350 sorties were flown, including attacks on Axis shipping in [[Cape Bon]] and in the [[Gulf of Tunis]].{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=252}} The campaign came to an end in mid-May,{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=104}} but the squadron continued defensive patrols into June.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=252}}&lt;!--During the North African campaign the squadron was credited with 39 aircraft destroyed, 18 probables, and a further seven damaged, for the loss of 33 personnel killed.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=109}}--&gt; Between February 1942 and May 1943, it claimed 49 German and Italian aircraft destroyed in aerial combat, for the loss of 31 pilots, four to accidents.{{sfn|Brown|1983|pp=293–294, 299–300}} As a result of its involvement in the North African fighting, the squadron received the nickname, &quot;The Desert Harassers&quot;,{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=103}} and adopted the motto, &quot;Harass&quot;, both of which were derived from a comment by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] propaganda broadcaster &quot;[[Lord Haw Haw]]&quot;, who described the unit as &quot;Australian [[mercenary|mercenaries]] whose harassing tactics were easily beaten off by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=AWM450Sqn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11143.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031204727/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11143.asp |publisher=Australian War Memorial |title=450 Squadron RAAF |work=Second World War, 1939–1945 units |accessdate=13 October 2013|archivedate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

Following the conclusion of the fighting in the desert, No. 450 Squadron was allocated a ground-attack role during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. Moving to Malta on 13 July 1943,{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=104}} the squadron staged out of [[RAF Luqa]], and undertook its first attack in [[Sicily]] against Carlentini. Four days later, on 17 July, No. 450 Squadron relocated to Pachino, Sicily, from where it continued ground-attack missions. A further move came on 1 August, when Nos. 450 and 3 Squadrons relocated to Agnone, near [[Catania]], where they commenced [[close air support]] operations on 11 August, working closely with Allied ground units around [[Mount Etna]].{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=252}} On the night of 11 August, the airfield was attacked by Ju 88 bombers, which dropped [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary]], anti-personnel and high-explosive bombs for more than an hour. No. 450 Squadron's personnel had been located some distance from the airfield and only one Australian was wounded, although casualties among other units amounted to twelve killed and 60 wounded.{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=88}} Eighteen RAAF Kittyhawks were destroyed, including eleven belonging to No. 450 Squadron.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=109}}{{sfn|Wilson|2005|pp=100–101}} Despite this, the two RAAF squadrons flew 22 sorties the following day.{{sfn|Herington|1954|p=578}}

During the early stages of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Allied campaign on the Italian mainland]], which commenced in early September 1943, the squadron undertook bomber escort missions in support of the Eighth Army's landings. In the middle of September, it reverted to the close air support role, operating from [[Taranto-Grottaglie Airport|Grottaglie]], although it also undertook anti-shipping operations, including an attack on [[Manfredonia]] on 21 September, during which its aircraft sunk two vessels.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=253}} The following month, No. 450 Squadron was transferred to [[Foggia]], and then to Mileni, where it was briefly withdrawn from operations to convert to newer model Kittyhawk IVs before rejoining the campaign in late November.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=253}}  In December, the squadron moved to [[Cutella]], near [[Termoli]], on the central [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast of Italy. There it encountered problems with severe winter weather restricting operations. Cutella airfield was located close to the beach; heavy rains caused a [[storm surge]] on 1 January 1944 and flooded the airfield, damaging some aircraft.{{sfn|Herington|1963|p=70}}

Meanwhile, Williams and another [[prisoner of war]] from No. 450 Squadron, Flight Lieutenant Reginald Kierath, were incarcerated with other Allied POWs at ''[[Stalag Luft III]]'', in eastern Germany. In March 1944, both took part in &quot;[[Stalag Luft III#The .22Great Escape.22The Great Escape|The Great Escape]]&quot; and were among 50 POWs murdered by the ''[[Gestapo]]'', after being recaptured.&lt;ref name=Edlington&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/EDITIONS/4605/history/story01.htm |author=Edlington, David |title=The Great Crime: Aussies Among Murder Victims |newspaper=Air Force News |volume=46 |issue=5 |date=8 April 2004 |accessdate=6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams, who was 27 years old and from Sydney, was officially an RAF officer, as he had joined the British service under a [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|short service commission]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=Edlington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34501|startpage=2458|date=12 April 1938|accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kierath, who was 29 and from [[Narromine, New South Wales]], was an RAAF officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=R&amp;VeteranId=1053367 |work=World War II Nominal Roll |title=Kierath, Reginald Victor |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout January 1944, No. 450 Squadron undertook anti-shipping operations as well as ground support tasks. It flew missions against targets off [[Dalmatia]] and in the harbour at [[Sibenik]], as well as around the ports of [[Velaluka]] and Zera. In March, the squadron's attention returned to Italy, launching strikes against rolling stock; the following month saw it heavily tasked, flying a total of 430 sorties.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=252}} On 29 April 1944, a USAAF [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] pilot strafed Cutella by mistake. No. 450 Squadron suffered no fatalities or aircraft destroyed but the pilot of a [[seaplane|float plane]] belonging to an [[Search and rescue|air-sea rescue]] unit was killed, some ground personnel were wounded, a Kittyhawk of No. 3 Squadron was destroyed and several others were damaged.{{sfn|Franks|2003|p=108}}{{sfn|Herington|1963|p=111}} The following month, No. 450 Squadron moved to San Angelo, mounting a series of attacks against a 200-vehicle convoy near [[Subiaco, Lazio|Subiaco]] in concert with other Kittyhawk squadrons that claimed 123 vehicles destroyed or damaged.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=253}}{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=110}} No. 450 Squadron later operated from several airfields in central and northern Italy, under the &quot;[[Taxicab stand|cab rank]]&quot; system, whereby patrolling fighter-bombers would attack as requested by army [[Forward air control|air liaison officer]]s.&lt;ref name=AWM450Sqn/&gt;{{sfn|Herington|1963 |pp=344–345}} It flew over 1,100 sorties in June and July. The Australian Kittyhawk units were regularly lauded for the accuracy of their assaults; following a mission by No. 450 Squadron on 12 July, the Eighth Army wired No. 239 Wing headquarters: &quot;Excellent bombing.

No. 450 Squadron took part in the major [[Gothic Line|offensive against the Gothic Line]] in August–September 1944.{{sfn|Herington|1963|pp=346–349}} Its first attack in early August was a strike on an artillery battery, during which three Kittyhawks were shot down; subsequent attacks throughout the following months were made against various targets including rolling stock, armour, and troop concentrations.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=253}} From November, after it had moved to Fano on the Italian north-east coast, the squadron also began attacking German forces in [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Herington|1963|p=353}} Its average complement of pilots during the second half of 1944 was 25 from the RAAF, seven from the RAF and five from the [[South African Air Force]].{{sfn|Herington|1963 |p=350}} No. 450 Squadron commenced operations from [[Cervia]] in February 1945; that month, it lost three pilots to prematurely detonating bombs.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=104}}{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|pp=110–111}} On 21 March, it took part in [[Operation Bowler]], a major air raid on [[Venice]] harbour.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=253}} The attack resulted in the sinking of a [[merchant ship]], a torpedo boat, and a coastal steamer, as well as the destruction of five warehouses and other harbour infrastructure.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=111}}

In May 1945, following the end of the war in Europe, No. 450 Squadron transferred to [[Lavariano]], a few miles south of [[Udine]] in north-eastern Italy.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=254}}{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=111}} It also began replacing its Kittyhawks with [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s.&lt;ref name=AWM450Sqn/&gt;{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=104}} The squadron was disbanded at Lavariano on 20 August 1945.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=254}}{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=111}} During the war, it had lost 63 personnel killed in action, of whom 49 were Australian.&lt;ref name=AWM450Sqn/&gt;

==Legacy==
The squadron was not re-raised by the RAAF after the war, although the numerical designation of &quot;450&quot; was assumed by a Canadian helicopter unit, [[450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron]], in March 1968. The use of the &quot;450&quot; designation was the result of an administrative error, as the Canadian 400 series squadrons formed during World War II had been numbered between 400 and 449. An agreement was subsequently reached between the RCAF and RAAF and the squadron kept the designation. It is based at [[Petawawa]], in Ontario, and operates [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/1-wing/450-squadron.page |title=450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron |publisher=Royal Canadian Air Force |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/article-template-standard.page?doc=450-tactical-helicopter-squadron-reborn/hky1djyr |title=450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron reborn |date=18 May 2012 |publisher=Royal Canadian Air Force |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
