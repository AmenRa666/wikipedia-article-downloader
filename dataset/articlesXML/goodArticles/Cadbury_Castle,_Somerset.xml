'''Cadbury Castle''', formerly known as '''Camalet''',&lt;ref name=rev&gt;Phelps, W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_vw1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA118 ''The History and Antiquities of Somersetshire; Being a General and Parochial Survey of That Interesting County, to which is Prefixed an Historical Introduction, with a Brief View of Ecclesiastical History; and an Account of the Druidical, Belgic-British, Roman, Saxon, Danish, and Norman Antiquities, Now Extant'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;II, Ch.&amp;nbsp;VI, §1: &quot;Camalet or Cadbury&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;118]. J.&amp;nbsp;B. Nichols &amp; Son (London), 1839.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze]] and [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] [[Hillforts in Britain|hillfort]] in the [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[South Cadbury]] in the [[England|English]] [[Ceremonial counties of England|county]] of [[Somerset]]. It is a [[scheduled monument]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadbury Castle|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=199646|work=National Monument Record|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been associated with [[King Arthur]]'s legendary court at &quot;[[Camelot]]&quot;.

The hillfort is formed by a {{convert|7.28|ha}} plateau surrounded by [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] on the surrounding slopes of the [[limestone]] Cadbury Hill. The site has been excavated in the late 19th and early 20th century by James Bennett and [[Harold St George Gray]]. More recent examination of the site was conducted in the 1960s by [[Leslie Alcock]] and since 1992 by the South Cadbury Environs Project. These have revealed artifacts from human occupation and use from the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] through the Bronze and Iron Ages. The site was reused by the Roman forces and again from c. 470 until some time after 580. In the 11th century, it temporarily housed a Saxon [[Mint (coin)|mint]]. Evidence of various buildings at the site has been unearthed, including a &quot;Great Hall&quot;, round and rectangular house foundations, metalworking, and a possible sequence of small rectangular [[Celtic polytheism|temples or shrines]].

==Background==
{{further information|Hillforts in Britain}}
[[Hillforts in Britain|Hillforts]] developed in the [[Bronze Age Britain|Late Bronze]] and [[British Iron Age|Early Iron]] ages, around the start of the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium&amp;nbsp;BC]].{{sfn|Payne|Corney|Cunliffe|2007|p=1}} The reason for their emergence in [[prehistoric Britain]] and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of [[iron]] led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of [[iron ore]] were located in different places from the [[tin mining in Britain|tin]] and [[copper mining in Britain|copper]] ore necessary to make [[bronze]] and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.{{sfn|Sharples|1991|pp=71–72}}

Archaeologist [[Barry Cunliffe]] believes that population increase still played a role and has stated that &quot;the forts provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress of an increasing population burst out into open warfare. But I would not see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2008/swords/swords-found.html |title=Time Team: Swords, skulls and strongholds |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=16 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812090914/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2008/swords/swords-found.html|archivedate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early occupation of the site==
[[Image:Yetholm type shield, South Cadbury 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[Yetholm-type shield]] from South Cadbury. Displayed at the [[Museum of Somerset]], [[Taunton]].]]
The earliest settlement on the site is represented by pits and post holes dated with [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] pottery and [[flint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadbury Castle&amp;nbsp;— Neolithic settlement, South Cadbury|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/54551|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the remains of a small agricultural settlement which was unenclosed.{{sfn|Barrett|2000|pp=319-324}} Bones recovered from the site have been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to 3500 and 3300 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhle&quot;/&gt; A bank under the later Iron Age defences is likely to be a lynchet or terrace derived from early ploughing of the hilltop. The site was also occupied in the Late Bronze Age, from which ovens have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadbury Castle&amp;nbsp;— Bronze Age settlement, South Cadbury|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/16342|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical revisions of the Bronze Age archaeology on the lower slopes{{sfn|Tabor|2008|pp=84–92}} resulted from discoveries during excavations and survey work by the South Cadbury Environs Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Cadbury Environs Project|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/index.html|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finds include the first Bronze Age shield from an excavation in northwest Europe, an example of the distinctive [[Yetholm-type shield|Yetholm-type]]. Carbon dating implies that the shield was deposited in the 10th century BC, although metallurgical evidence suggests that it was manufactured two centuries earlier.&lt;ref name=museumofsomerset/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excavation|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/Excavation.html|publisher=South Cadbury Environs Project|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metal-working building and associated enclosure were discovered {{convert|2|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} south east of the hillfort, roughly contemporary with the period of manufacture.{{sfn|Tabor|2008|pp=61–69}}

Human occupation continued throughout the Iron Age.&lt;ref name=sher54552&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Age Hillfort, South Cadbury Castle|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/54552|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stone [[Enclosure (archaeology)|enclosure]] was constructed around 300 BC with timber [[Revetment|revetting]], and ploughing ceased within the hilltop site. Excavations have shown the signs of four and six post rectangular buildings which were gradually replaced with [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]].{{sfn|Barrett|2000|pp=319-324}} Large ramparts and elaborate timber defences were constructed and refortified over the following centuries. Excavation revealed round and rectangular house foundations, metalworking, and a possible sequence of small rectangular [[Celtic polytheism|temples or shrines]],{{sfn|Dunning|2003|p=10}}{{sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1992|pp=2101–103}} indicating permanent [[oppidum]]-like occupation.{{sfn|Leach|2001|p=12}} Excavations were undertaken by local clergyman James Bennett in 1890 and [[Harold St George Gray]] in 1913, followed by major work led by archaeologist [[Leslie Alcock]] from 1966–1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Cadbury Hillfort|url=http://digitaldigging.net/cadbury-castle-hillfort-somerset/|publisher=Digital Digging|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified a long sequence of occupation on the site and many of the finds are displayed in the [[Museum of Somerset]] in [[Taunton]].&lt;ref name=museumofsomerset&gt;{{cite web|title=South Cadbury Shield|url=http://museumofsomerset.org.uk/highlights/south-cadbury-shield/#main|publisher=Museum of Somerset|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finds from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, exploring the ramparts and southwestern gate structure, represent one of the deepest and most complex Iron Age [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] sequences excavated in southern Britain.{{sfn|Barrett|Freeman|Woodward|2000|p=116}}

==Castle==

During the first century [[Anno Domini|BC]] additional lines of bank and ditch were constructed turning it into a [[Hill fort#Types of hill fort|multivallate]] [[Hillforts in Britain|hillfort]] which is now known as the ''castle''.{{sfn|Barrett|2000|pp=319-324}} There is evidence that the fort was violently taken in around AD&amp;nbsp;43 and that the defences were further slighted later in the 1st century after the construction of a Roman army barracks on the hilltop.{{sfn|Alcock|1972|p=105-107}} Excavations of the southwest gate in 1968 and 1969 revealed evidence for one or more severe violent episodes, associated with weaponry and destruction by fire.{{sfn|Aston|Burrow|1991|p=63}} Whereas the excavator, Leslie Alcock, believed this to have been dated to around AD&amp;nbsp;70,{{sfn|Dunning|1995|pp=24–26}} Richard Tabor argues for a date associated with the initial invasion, either AD&amp;nbsp;43 or 44.{{sfn|Tabor|2008|p=160}} Michael Havinden states that it was the site of vigorous resistance by the [[Durotriges]] and [[Dobunni]] to the [[Legio II Augusta|second Augusta Legion]] under the command of [[Vespasian]].{{sfn|Havinden|1981|pp=58–59}}

[[File:Cadbury Castle defences - geograph.org.uk - 2720.jpg|thumb|The ramparts]]

There was significant activity at the site during the late third and fourth centuries, which may have included the construction of a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadbury Castle&amp;nbsp;— Roman activity and Temple, South Cadbury|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/54553|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Roman occupation==
Following the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|withdrawal of the Roman administration]], the site is thought to have been in use from {{c.|470}} until some time after 580.&lt;ref name=nhle/&gt; Alcock revealed a substantial &quot;Great Hall&quot; {{convert|20|x|10|m}} and showed that the innermost Iron Age defences had been refortified, providing a defended site double the size of any other known fort of the period. Shards of pottery from the eastern Mediterranean were also found from this period, indicating wide trade links.{{sfn|Alcock|1972|pp=182-183}}{{sfn|Tabor|2008|pp=169–172}} It therefore seems probable that it was the chief ''[[caer]]'' (&quot;fort&quot;) of a major [[Celtic Britons|Brythonic]] ruler, his family, his ''teulu'' (literally meaning &quot;family&quot;, but actually meaning &quot;warband&quot;), servants, and horses.{{sfn|Alcock|1972|pp=156-157}}

Between 1010 and 1020, the hill was reoccupied for use as a temporary Saxon [[Mint (coin)|mint]], standing in for that at [[Ilchester]].&lt;ref name=nhle/&gt;{{sfn|Alcock|1972|pp=195-197}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadbury Castle&amp;nbsp;— Saxon burh, South Cadbury|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/54555|website=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadanbyrig|url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=1007895|website=Pastscape|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Metcalf|1998|pp=247-248}} Some small-scale fortification of the site may also have occurred in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadbury Castle, Castle and later activity, South Cadbury|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/54807|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Cadbury Castle is located {{convert|5|mi}} north east of [[Yeovil]]. It stands on the summit of Cadbury Hill, a [[limestone]] hill situated on the southern edge of the [[Somerset Levels]], with flat lowland to the north. The summit is {{Convert|153|m|ft|abbr=on|-1}} above sea-level on [[Lias Group|lias]] stone.{{sfn|Haslett|2010|pp=72–76}}{{sfn|Barrett|Freeman|Woodward|2000|p=11}}

The hill is surrounded by terraced earthwork banks and ditches and a stand of trees. On the north west and south sides there are 4 ramparts, with two remaining on the east. The summit plateau covers {{convert|7.28|ha}},&lt;ref name=&quot;nhle&quot;&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1011980 |desc=Large multivallate hillfort and associated earthworks at South Cadbury|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sher54552/&gt; and is surrounded by the inner bank which is {{convert|1.2|km}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The South Cadbury Excavations|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/The_South_Cadbury_excavations.html|website=South Cadbury Environs Project|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hill fort is overlooked by [[Sigwells]], a rural plateau rich in archaeological remains. Due to scrub and tree growth the site has been added to the [[Heritage at Risk]] register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Large multivallate hillfort and associated earthworks at South Cadbury, South Cadbury&amp;nbsp;— South Somerset|url=http://risk.historicengland.org.uk/register.aspx?id=33477|work=Heritage at Risk|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadbury Castle, South Cadbury|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/55105|website=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:Cadbury Castle Stukeley.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Engraving of Cadbury Castle, drawn in 1723 by [[William Stukeley]] and captioned &quot;Prospect of Camalet Castle&quot;]]

The [[suffix]] ''-bury'' or sometimes ''byrig''&quot;; ''byrig'' is the Anglo-Saxon word meaning &quot;fort&quot; or &quot;town&quot;, which is frequently, but not exclusively, used to refer to hill-forts. The first part of the name may come from the [[River Cam (Somerset)|River Cam]] as with nearby villages the villages of [[West Camel]] and [[Queen Camel]].&lt;ref name=ntironage&gt;{{cite web|title=The Iron Age past of Cadbury Camp|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cadbury-camp/visitor-information/article-1355805869188/|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clambering over Cadbury Camp|url=http://old.n-somerset.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/DC68947F-04C0-4704-85DB-135EAD72E366/0/WalkFromNorthSomersetLifeIssue72October2010.pdf|publisher=North Somerset Council|accessdate=4 May 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ekwall|1960|p=80}} Other scholars suggest a derivation from some figure named &quot;[[Cador]]&quot; or &quot;Cada&quot;.{{sfn|Bush|1994|p=154}} It is one of three sites in Somerset to include the Cadbury name, the others being [[Cadbury Camp]], near [[Tickenham]] and [[Cadbury Hill]] which is also known as Cadbury-Congresbury to distinguish it from the other sites.

Local tradition, first written down by [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] in 1542, holds that Cadbury Castle was [[King Arthur]]'s [[Camelot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Dai Morgan|title=‘King Arthur’ and Cadbury Castle, Somerset|journal=The Antiquaries Journal|date=2006|volume=86|pages=227–253|doi=10.1017/S0003581500000123|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2771440}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site and the Great Hall are extensive, and the writer [[Geoffrey Ashe]] argued in an article in the journal ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'' that it was the base for the Arthur of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ashe|first=Geoffrey | title=A Certain Very Ancient British Book: Traces of an Arthurian Source in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History | journal=Speculum | year=1981 | volume=56 | pages= 301–23 | doi=10.2307/2846937 | issue=2 | publisher=Speculum, Vol. 56, No. 2 | jstor=2846937}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion has not been widely accepted by all students of the period.{{sfn|Alcock|1972|pp=11-18}}

Militarily, the location makes sense as a place where refugees and the southwestern Brythons of [[Dumnonia]] could have defended themselves against attacks from the east. If Arthur was indeed conceived at [[Tintagel]], as tradition asserts,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#19|Book 8.19–24]], [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 9|Book 9]], [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 10|Book 10]], [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 11|Book 11.1–2]]&lt;/ref&gt; he may have been a prince of Dumnonia and used Cadbury as a stronghold on his eastern frontier.{{sfn|Reno|1996|p=206}}

==South Cadbury Environs Project==

The recent work on the archaeology of the site and the surrounding area has been carried out by the South Cadbury Environs Project. Since 1992 the project team, which included local volunteers South East Somerset Archaeological and Historical Society and the Yeovil Archaeology and Local History Society, have carried out [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|geophysical surveys]] including [[Gradiometer|gradiometry]] and [[electrical resistivity tomography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geophysics|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/Geophysics.html|website=South Cadbury Environs Project|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ploughzone sampling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ploughzone sampling|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/Ploughzone_sampling.html|website=South Cadbury Environs Project|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shovel test pit|test pits]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Test Pits|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/Test_pits.html|website=South Cadbury Environs Project|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; deeper excavations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excavation|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/Excavation.html|website=South Cadbury Environs Project|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[geographic information system]] (GIS) approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GIS Work|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/GIS_work.html|website=South Cadbury Environs Project|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project had input from academics and archaeologists from the universities of [[University of Bristol|Bristol]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], funded by the [[Leverhulme Trust]] and [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCEP Project History|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/SCEP_Project_history.html|publisher=South Cadbury Environs Project|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project studies the castle and surrounding area up to {{convert|8|km}} away, using landscape sampling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landscape Sampling|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/Landscape_sampling.html|website=South Cadbury Environs Project|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
