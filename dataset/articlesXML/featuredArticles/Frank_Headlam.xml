[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Frank Headlam''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|CB|CBE}} (15 July 1914&amp;nbsp;– 23&amp;nbsp;December 1976) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born and educated in [[Tasmania]], he joined the RAAF as an air cadet in January 1934. He specialised in flying instruction and navigation before the [[Military history of Australia in World War II|outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. In April 1941, he became commanding officer of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron]], which operated [[Lockheed Hudson]]s. The squadron was deployed to [[West Timor|Dutch Timor]] in December, and saw action against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]]. After returning to Australia in February 1942, Headlam held staff appointments and training commands, finishing the war a [[group captain]].

Headlam served as Officer Commanding [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area]] in 1946, and as Director of Training from 1947 to 1950. In 1950–51, during the [[Malayan Emergency]], he was stationed at Singapore as commander of [[No. 90 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;90 (Composite) Wing]] and, later, [[Tengah Air Base|RAF Tengah]]. He twice served as acting Air Member for Personnel, in 1957 and 1959–60, receiving appointment as a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1958. Promoted air vice marshal, he successively held the positions of [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) [[RAAF Air Command|Operational Command]] in 1961–62, AOC [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|No.&amp;nbsp;224 Group RAF]] from 1962 to 1965 during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia–Malaysia ''Konfrontasi'']], [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] in 1965–66, and AOC [[RAAF Support Command|Support Command]] in 1966–67. He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1965. Following a posting to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff from 1968 to 1971, he retired from the Air Force and died in [[Melbourne]] five years later.

==Early career==

The son of farmers Malcolm and Hilda Headlam, Frank Headlam was born on 15&amp;nbsp;July 1914 in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], Tasmania. He was schooled at Clemes College, [[Hobart]], and [[Matriculation|matriculated]] in 1932. Against the wishes of his parents he joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) as an air cadet on 16&amp;nbsp;January 1934.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Brian|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/headlam-frank-10468|title=Headlam, Frank (1914–1976)|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate= 8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WW2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=R&amp;VeteranId=1081112|title=Headlam, Frank|work= World War 2 Nominal Roll|publisher=[[Department of Veterans' Affairs (Australia)|Department of Veterans' Affairs]]|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent flying instruction with [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] (FTS) at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria, and was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1935.&lt;ref name=NAAP&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|title=Headlam, Frank&amp;nbsp;– Personal|date=1932–1971|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=30718846|accessdate=10 July 2013|pages= 141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing a [[operational conversion unit|conversion]] course, Headlam was assigned to the [[Seaplane Squadron RAAF|Seaplane Squadron]] at Point Cook.&lt;ref name=NAAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Power41&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', pp. 41–42, 52&lt;/ref&gt; No larger than a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] according to the official history of the pre-war RAAF, Seaplane Squadron was part of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS and operated [[Supermarine Southampton]] flying boats and [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|de Havilland Gipsy Moth]] floatplanes, among other types.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 127–128, 176, 420&lt;/ref&gt; During this posting Headlam was promoted to [[flying officer]], on 1&amp;nbsp;July 1935, and wrote a paper on national defence in which he suggested that with &quot;strong air forces, naval forces (including submarines), and fixed defences, Australia may be made practically invulnerable&quot;. According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, this paper &quot;in effect, defined the 'anti-lodgment' concept which has been a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking&quot;.&lt;ref name=Power41/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAAH/&gt;

Headlam completed a flying instructors course in July 1936 and joined the staff of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS.&lt;ref name=NAAP/&gt; He was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1937.&lt;ref name=NAAH&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of Defence|title=Headlam, Frank&amp;nbsp;– History|date=1947–1988|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=30718845|accessdate=10 July 2013|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commencing in July 1938, he was one of six students to take part in the RAAF's first Long Specialist Navigation Course, run by Flight Lieutenants [[Bill Garing]] and [[Alister Murdoch]] at Point Cook. The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention, including a twelve-day, {{convert|10800|km|mi|sing=on}} round-Australia trip by three [[Avro Anson]]s, one of which was piloted by Headlam, in November. The following month, Headlam led the three Ansons on a six-day journey back and forth over [[Central Australia]]. He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction.&lt;ref name=Third&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 207–210&lt;/ref&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;January 1939 he was posted to [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]], Victoria, as a flight commander.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAAH/&gt; He served initially with [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron]], before transferring to [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] on 29&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref name=NAAH/&gt; Both units operated Ansons.&lt;ref name=Bomber8&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A4.htm|title=Avro Anson|publisher=[[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather19&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==

Following the [[Military history of Australia during World War II|outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and maritime reconnaissance duties off south-eastern Australia.&lt;ref name=Eather19/&gt; Headlam continued to serve with the squadron as a flight commander until 15&amp;nbsp;January 1940, when he was assigned to Headquarters Laverton as the station navigation officer. On 27&amp;nbsp;March he was posted to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, [[Melbourne]]. He was promoted to [[squadron leader]] on 1&amp;nbsp;June 1940.&lt;ref name=NAAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAAH/&gt; Two weeks later he married Katherine Bridge at St Paul's Anglican Church in [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]]; the couple would have a son and a daughter.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

Headlam was given command of No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron at Laverton on 15&amp;nbsp;April 1941, and raised to [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref name=NAAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAAH/&gt; Equipped with [[Lockheed Hudson]]s, the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until 5&amp;nbsp;December, when four of its aircraft were ordered to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, in response to fears of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] aggression in the Pacific.&lt;ref name=Bomber8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather22&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; On 7&amp;nbsp;December, this detachment established itself at [[El Tari Airport|Penfui]], near [[Kupang|Koepang]] in [[West Timor|Dutch Timor]], while No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron's eight remaining Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby.&lt;ref name=Gillison237&gt;Gillison, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070482--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 237–238, 242]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, aware that Australia was now at [[Pacific War|war in the Pacific]], one of the Penfui-based Hudsons attacked the Japanese [[Pearl hunting|pearler]] ''Nanyo Maru'', which was suspected of being a radio ship, and forced it aground.&lt;ref name=Bomber8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison237/&gt; By 12&amp;nbsp;December, Headlam had transferred to Penfui as commanding officer of the base, as well as No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron.&lt;ref name=Gillison237/&gt;

During January 1942, No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron's aircraft were dispersed at Penfui, [[Buru|Boeroe Island]], and Darwin. The Penfui detachment attacked Japanese shipping taking part in the invasion of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]].&lt;ref name=Bomber8/&gt; Two Hudsons shot down or damaged three Japanese floatplanes that attacked them as they were bombing a transport ship on 11&amp;nbsp;January; the next day both Hudsons were themselves shot down by [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zeros]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Penfui was bombed by the Japanese for the first time on 26&amp;nbsp;January 1942, and attacked regularly thereafter, damaging some aircraft. The intact Hudsons were withdrawn to Darwin but Headlam and his staff remained at Penfui to enable the base to be used by aircraft during reconnaissance missions from Australia.&lt;ref name=Bomber8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; On 18&amp;nbsp;February, Headlam was ordered to evacuate all his personnel except a small party to demolish the airfield with assistance from [[Sparrow Force]].&lt;ref name=Gillison421&gt;Gillison, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070514--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 421–422]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Darwin the following day, just as the city experienced its first [[Attack on Darwin|raid by the Japanese]].&lt;ref name=NAAH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 119, 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; Four of No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron's Hudsons were destroyed in the attack; the remainder were relocated to [[Daly Waters]], where they continued to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese targets in Timor.&lt;ref name=Bomber8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather22/&gt;

Headlam remained in Darwin as Controller of Operations at Headquarters [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area Command]] until 12&amp;nbsp;May 1942, when he was posted to [[Nhill]], Victoria, as commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;2 Air Navigation School, operating Ansons.&lt;ref name=AVM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Marshals-of-the-RAAF/135/Air-Vice-Marshals-A-K.aspx |title=Air Vice-Marshals (A–K) |work=Air Marshals of the RAAF|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Training2&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;97 (Reserve) Squadron was formed from the school's personnel in June.&lt;ref name=Training2/&gt;  On 20&amp;nbsp;July 1943, Headlam took command of No.&amp;nbsp;2 Air Observer School (AOS), also operating Ansons, at [[Mount Gambier]], South Australia.&lt;ref name=Training6&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[group captain]] on 1&amp;nbsp;December 1943, and was appointed the inaugural commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;3 AOS, operating Ansons and [[Fairey Battle]]s out of [[Port Pirie]], on 9&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref name=NAAH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Training6/&gt; After handing over command of No.&amp;nbsp;3 AOS, he commenced studies at [[RAAF Staff College|RAAF Staff School]] in [[Mount Martha]], Victoria, on 2&amp;nbsp;October 1944.
