'''HMS ''Plumper''''' was an 8-gun wooden screw [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] of the [[Royal Navy]], the fifth and last ship to bear the name. Launched in 1848, she served three commissions, firstly on the West Indies and North American Station, then on the West Africa Station and finally in the Pacific Station. It was during her last commission as a survey ship that she left her most enduring legacy; in charting the west coast of British Columbia she left her name and those of her ship's company scattered across the charts of the region. She [[Ship_commissioning#Ship_decommissioning|paid off]] for the last time in 1861 and was finally sold for breaking up in 1865.

==Construction==
The Admiralty originally ordered the ship on 25 April 1847 from Woolwich Dockyard as the steam schooner ''Pincher''.&lt;ref name=RW&gt;{{winfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was re-ordered from [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]] as the screw sloop ''Plumper'' on 12 August 1847 to a design by John Fincham, and laid down in October that year. She was launched on 5 April 1848 at Portsmouth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London  |date=6 April 1848 |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned under Commander Mathew Nolloth on 17 December.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt;

''Plumper'' was the only ship ever built to the design. She was constructed of wood, was {{convert|140|ft|0|in|m|1}} long and {{convert|27|ft|10|in|m|1}} in the beam, and drew {{convert|11|ft|4+1/2|in|m|}}. This hull gave her a displacement of 577 tons.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt;

She was powered by a Miller, Ravenhill &amp; Co two-cylinder vertical single-expansion steam engine driving a single screw. Developing 148 [[horsepower#Indicated horsepower|indicated horsepower]], this unit was capable of driving her at {{convert|7.4|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt; Illustrations show her with a [[Barque|barque rig]], although this may have been a later alteration.

Her armament of 8 guns consisted of six 32-pounder (25 cwt) and two 32-pounder (56 cwt) muzzle-loading smooth-bore guns mounted to fire in a traditional broadside arrangement.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt;&lt;ref name=gun group=Note&gt;&quot;32-pounder&quot; denotes the weight of projectile fired, 56 (or 25) cwt is the weight of the gun (&quot;cwt&quot; = [[hundredweight]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===First commission (1848–1853)===
After commissioning at Portsmouth, ''Plumper'' joined the Channel Fleet under [[Charles John Napier|Admiral Sir Charles Napier]], and in January 1849 was sent to the [[North America and West Indies Station]]. Curiously, a report was published in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' on 14 April 1849 of a sighting of a sea serpent off the Portuguese Coast.
[[File:HMS Plumper sea serpent 1848.jpg|thumb|right|''Supposed Appearance of the Great Sea-Serpent, From H.M.S. Plumper, Sketched by an Officer on Board'', ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 14 April 1849]]
{{cquote|On the morning of the 31st December, 1848, in lat. 41° 13'N., and long. 12° 31'W., being nearly due west of Oporto, I saw a long black creature with a sharp head, moving slowly, I should think about two knots ... its back was about twenty feet if not more above water; and its head, as near as I could judge, from six to eight...There was something on its back that appeared like a mane, and, as it moved through the water, kept washing about; but before I could examine it more closely, it was too far astern |20px|20px|&quot;A Naval Officer&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Illustrated London News]], 14 April 1849&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In June 1851 she deployed to the south-east coast of America&lt;ref name=WL/&gt; and during this period she captured the slavers ''Flor-do-Mar'' on 14 June 1851&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=21649 |date=9 January 1855|startpage=108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sarah'' on 9 June 1851 (with HMS ''Cormorant'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue= 21714 |date=18 May 1855|startpage=1935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is recorded as arriving in Portsmouth from Brazil with {{convert|6370|ozt|kg}} of gold trans-shipped from the ''Emperor'' on 31 December 1852.&lt;ref name=PB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/18-1900/P/03576.html|title=HMS ''Plumper'' at the Naval Database|accessdate=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She paid off at Portsmouth on 6 January 1853.&lt;ref name=WL/&gt;

===Second commission (1853–1856)===
''Plumper'' recommissioned at Portsmouth on 1 August 1853 under Commander Wharton for service on the west coast of Africa. At the time, the [[West Africa Squadron]] was employed overwhelmingly in anti-slavery patrols, and the [[London Gazette]] records the capture of a slaving vessel of unknown name by ''Plumper'' on 19 October 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=22023 |date=21 July 1857|startpage=2517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 5 April 1855 she was commanded by Commander William Henry Haswell and she paid off at Portsmouth on 9 December 1856.&lt;ref name=WL/&gt;

===Third commission (1857–1861)===
[[File:HMS Plumper (1848) at Port Harvey.jpg|thumb|left|''HMS Plumper at Port Harvey, Vancouver Island'' from a drawing by E P Bedwell]]For her third commission, the ''Plumper'' was converted to a survey ship, and it is probable that her armament was increased at this time to 12 guns.&lt;ref name=PB/&gt; Her captain from 1857 until January 1861 was [[George Henry Richards|Captain George Henry Richards]]. She was used to survey the coast of [[British Columbia]], in particular the [[Fraser River]], [[Burrard Inlet]], Howe Sound, Sunshine Coast,&lt;ref&gt;Little, Gary. [http://www.garylittle.ca/maps-historic/richards.html &quot;Capt. George Henry Richards: 1860 Sunshine Coast Survey&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]].&lt;ref name=WL/&gt; The ''Plumper'', having embarked a company of [[Royal Marine]]s, was involved in the [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] crisis between the United States and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1859; along with [[HMS Tribune (1853)|''Tribune'']], which was commanded by Captain [[Geoffrey Thomas Phipps Hornby|Geoffrey Hornby]], the ''Plumper'' and [[HMS Satellite (1855)|HMS ''Satellite'']] were dispatched by Governor [[James Douglas (Governor)|James Douglas]] to prevent American soldiers from erecting fortifications on [[San Juan Island]] and bringing in reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=5724|title=San Juan Island Pig War – Part 1 at History Link website|accessdate=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Brockton]] was the ship's engineer under Captain Richards when, in 1859, Brockton found a vein of coal in the [[Vancouver]] area. After the discovery, which Richards reported to Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]], Richards named the area of the find [[Coal Harbour]] and named [[Brockton Point]], at the east end of what is now [[Stanley Park]] in Vancouver, after Francis Brockton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=1107|title=Brockton Point, BC at Lighthouse Friends website|accessdate=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Hoskins|Commander Anthony Hoskins]] brought [[HMS Hecate (1839)|HMS ''Hecate'']] out to the Pacific Station and swapped commands with Richards, taking command of the ''Plumper'' in January 1861. He then returned to the United Kingdom, paying the ship off at Portsmouth on 2 July 1861.&lt;ref name=WL/&gt;

==Disposal==
''Plumper'' was sold to White of [[Cowes]] for breaking on 2 June 1865.&lt;ref name=WL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowShip.php?id=170|title=HMS ''PLumper'' at William Loney website|accessdate=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other features were named after the ship's company, including:

*[[Campbell River, British Columbia]] for Dr [[Samuel Campbell (doctor)|Samuel Campbell]], the ship's surgeon.
