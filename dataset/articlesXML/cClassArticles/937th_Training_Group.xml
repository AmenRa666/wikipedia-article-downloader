The '''937th Training Group''' is a [[United States Air Force]] unit stationed at [[Fort Sam Houston]], part of [[Joint Base San Antonio]], Texas.  It conducts medical training for the Air Force.  

It was previously active with the [[442d Tactical Airlift Wing]] at [[Tinker Air Force Base]], Oklahoma.  The [[group (military aviation unit) was activated in January 1963 as the '''937th Troop Carrier Group''' when [[Continental Air Command]] formed groups to improve the mobilization capability of its dispersed troop carrier squadron (aviation)|squadrons]].  It was inactivated on 20 May 1972 and replaced in the reserves at Tinker by the [[507th Tactical Fighter Group]] when the reserve unit at Tinker converted from [[airlift]] to [[fighter aircraft]].

==History==
===Need for reserve troop carrier groups===
After May 1959, the reserve flying force consisted of 45 troop carrier squadrons assigned to 15 troop carrier wings.&lt;ref group=note&gt;There were an additional four rescue squadrons not assigned to the wings. Cantwell, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadrons were not all located with their parent wings, but were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.  The concept offered several advantages.  Communities were more likely to accept the smaller [[squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] than the large [[wing (military aviation unit)|wings]] and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning.  &lt;ref&gt;Cantwell, pp. 156, 169&lt;/ref&gt;  However, under this concept, all support organizations were located with the wing headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;   Although this was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult.  This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]].  To resolve this, at the start of 1962, [[Continental Air Command]], (ConAC) determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons.  This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed.&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell, pp. 189-191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activation of the 937th Troop Carrier Group===
As a result, the '''937th Troop Carrier Group''' was established at [[Tinker Air Force Base]], Oklahoma on 17 January 1963 as the headquarters for the [[305th Troop Carrier Squadron]], which had been stationed there since November 1957.&lt;ref name=Maurer305TCS&gt;Maurer, pp. 369-370&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with group [[headquarters]], a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 305th.  The group was equipped with [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II]]s for [[Tactical Air Command]] airlift operations.

The group was one of three C-124 groups assigned to the [[442d Troop Carrier Wing]] in 1963, the others being the [[935th Tactical Airlift Group|935th]] and [[936th Troop Carrier Group]]s at [[Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base]], Missouri.

The group flew overseas missions, particularly to the Far East and Southeast Asia during the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1972 the group was inactivated as part of the retirement of the Globemaster II, being one of the last USAF units to fly the C-124.  Its place at Tinker was taken by the [[507th Tactical Fighter Group]]. flying [[Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs]], and many members of the 937th transitioned to the new group.&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical training===
In 2011, USAF training activities at [[Fort Sam Houston]] were transferred from the [[82d Training Wing]] to the [[37th Training Wing]].  The group was redesignated the '''937th Training Group''' and replaced the 782d Training Group there.&lt;ref name=OCSRSep2011&gt;Research Division, Air Force Historical Research Agency, Air Force Organization Change Status Report, September 2011, Maxwell AFB, AL&lt;/ref&gt;  The 937th Training Group is the only medical training group in the Air Force. It conducts basic and advanced medical courses, and graduates nearly 6,000 students a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.37trw.af.mil/About/FactSheets/Display/tabid/3046/Article/461201/937th-training-group.aspx |last1=|first1=|title=Fact Sheet 937th Training Group|date=January 5, 2012|publisher=37th Training Wing Public Affairs|deadurl=no |accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
