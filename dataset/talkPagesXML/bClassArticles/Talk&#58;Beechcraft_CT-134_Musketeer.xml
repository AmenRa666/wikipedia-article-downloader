==Designation==

It is interesting to note that the official [http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/site/equip/historical/musketeerlst_e.asp DND history page] on the Musketeer refers to its designation as the &quot;CT-134&quot;, while the Canadian Forces Technical Order C-12-134-000/MC-000 which is the aircraft's checklist refers to it as the &quot;CT 134&quot; (no dash). - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 16:51, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

:Every designation that I have looked at on the CF sites use the dash, as do every professionally publised source I have seen. I've heard that the dash is not part of the official designation, but in practice, even the government appears to ignore it! - [[User:BillCJ|BillCJ]] ([[User talk:BillCJ|talk]]) 19:59, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

::It is funny - I have a large collection of &quot;MC&quot;s (issue checklists) and except for the CT-133 the rest all omit the dash. The rest of the CFTOs are the same way, no dash. The Huey is another oddball checklist, mine says &quot;CH118&quot;. It seems that only the PR folks consistently added the dash to make the designations look more American, I suppose. - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 23:44, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

:::Of interest I checked the few copies of the &quot;MB&quot;s that I have (CFTO Aircraft Operating Instructions), which are as official as it gets for aircraft nomenclature and these put the designations as CH136, CH135 and CH118! The most official pub on the designations is in the [http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/cfao/036-37_e.asp CFAOs], but the new versions of the designation documents are not publicly available. My conclusion is even the CFTO MC and MBs don't agree, so I don't think it is all that important! - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 12:11, 29 June 2008 (UTC)

==Photos==
Adam, do you have any usable photos of CT-134s? - [[User:BillCJ|BillCJ]] ([[User talk:BillCJ|talk]]) 19:59, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

:I can check again - the one that is on this page is the best one I had. If I had known in 1981 that I would be helping write an encyclopedia I would have taken more photos! - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 23:46, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

::I have checked again - I only have three and the one already posted here is the only good one I have. - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 00:42, 29 June 2008 (UTC)

==Operational History==

The only CT134 accident that is mentioned is the one in 1990. When I was in pilot training at Portage in 1982 there was a crash which killed 3 people. It was a familiarization flight not formally part of the training. I can't find any references on it on the web at all...but I was there. I know it happened. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/202.86.29.25|202.86.29.25]] ([[User talk:202.86.29.25|talk]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;

:There have definitely been a number of other CT-134 accidents, if we can find refs they can be added as per [[WP:V]], otherwise it is all [[WP:OR]]. - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 12:37, 15 September 2010 (UTC)

== B23 or C23? ==

I own a '71 Musketeer. It's designation on the data plate is a C23, not a B23, There's a bit of confusion about that because it's generally thought that the C23 is a Sundowner, but no: the 1971 is indeed designated the C23 Musketeer Custom. In 1972 the left-hand door was made standard, and the name changed to Sundowner

[[User:Joe Gerardi|Joe Gerardi]] ([[User talk:Joe Gerardi|talk]]) 09:52, 24 November 2011 (UTC)Joe

:The refs indicate that the CF bought B23s in 1971 and that it was a hasty purchase. I would at all be surpised if they were actually unsold stock from the previous year, which could explain the discrepancy! The ref doesn't actually say they were 1971 models, just that they were bought in 1971, so let me fix that. - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 13:26, 24 November 2011 (UTC)</text>
