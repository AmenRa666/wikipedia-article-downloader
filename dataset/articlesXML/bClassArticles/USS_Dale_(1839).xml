'''USS ''Dale'' (1839)''' (later '''''Oriole''''') was a [[sloop-of-war]] in the [[United States Navy]] [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 11 December 1839.  ''Dale'' was involved in the [[Mexican-American War]], the [[American Civil War]], operations along Africa to suppress slave trade, and was used in the US Coast Guard, among other activities.  ''Dale'' was placed [[reserve fleet|into ordinary]] (naval reserve) numerous times.

==Construction &amp; Commissioning==
''Dale'' was one of six war ships authorized to be constructed by The Congressional Act of 3 April 1837.  The first of this group was [[USS Princeton (1843)|''Princeton'']], the Navy's first screw steamer.  The other five became the 'Third Class Sloops' ''Dale, [[USS Yorktown (1839)|Yorktown]], [[USS Preble (1839)|Preble]], [[Marion (ship)|Marion]]'', and ''[[USS Decatur (1839)|Decatur]]'' and were built to the design of [[John Lenthall (shipbuilder)|John Lenthall]].  ''Dale'' was the only one of the five built at the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]] and was fastest of the five.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canney&quot;/&gt;  She was built under the supervision of [[Charles Stewart (1778–1869)|Charles Stewart]], [[Commandant]], of the navy yard at the time&lt;ref name=&quot;BerubeRodgaard2005&quot;/&gt;

''Dale'' was launched on 8 November 1839, commissioned on 11 December 1839 with Commander [[John Gwinn]] in command and was taken to [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] to be readied for sea.  She was named in memorial of [[Richard Dale]] (6 Nov 1756 – 26 Feb 1826) who was a [[prisoner of war]] three times during the [[American Revolutionary War]], an officer upon the founding of the [[United States Navy]] and Commodore of the [[Tripoli]] [[blockade]] during the [[First Barbary War]] in North Africa.  To date USS ''Dale'' was the first of five ships memorialized after Richard Dale.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS1&quot;/&gt;

==First &amp; Second Cruise==
''Dale''{{'}}s first cruise, which she sailed from Norfolk on 13 December 1840, took her around [[Cape Horn]] to the [[Pacific Squadron|Pacific Station]]. Based at [[Valparaíso]], Chile, she patrolled the eastern waters of the Pacific Ocean to protect American commerce and the whaling industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS1&quot;/&gt;  During the late summer of 1842 ''Dale'' Commanded by Dornin was part of the Pacific fleet under Commodore Thomas Jones.  Commodore Jones, while stationed with his fleet in [[Callao]], [[Peru]] understood, incorrectly, from local news papers that war had broken out between Mexico and the United States, prompting Commodore Jones to capture the Mexican town of [[Monterey|Monterey, California]].  ''Dale'' was not present for the capture of Monterey as Dornin had been directed by Thomas to [[Panama]] with a dispatch to Washington DC stating his intention to capture Mexican towns along the Pacific coast.  Shortly after capturing Monterey Thomas realized that a state of war did not exist and regressed from Monterey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;/&gt;{{rp|55–56}}

Upon ''Dale''′s return to the east coast in October 1843, she went [[reserve fleet|into ordinary]] at New York City until early in 1846, when she was refitted for a second cruise in the Pacific. Sailing from New York on 6 June 1846, ''Dale'' arrived at Valparaiso on 8 September, and cruised the coast of South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS1&quot;/&gt;

==Mexican-American War==
[[File:USS Dale San Jose del Cabo Mexico.jpg|framed|left|USS ''Dale'' off coast of Jose del Cabo Mexico]]
With the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]] ''Dale'', under Commander [[Thomas O. Selfridge]], was ordered north.  The sloop arrived off [[Monterey, California]], in January 1847, and through the remaining year of the war, cruised the coasts of Mexico and California. Not only did she capture several Mexican privateers and merchantmen, but landing parties she sent ashore raised the U.S. flag over the towns of [[Guaymas]] on the main land and [[Battle of Mulege|Mulege]] on the [[Baja California Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS1&quot;/&gt;

''Dale'' arrived in [[San José del Cabo]] on 19 September 1847 with [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']]. ''Dale'' was assigned the duty of preventing traffic between Guaymas and Mulege.  On 27 September ''Dale'' stopped at [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]] while heading north and it was learned that approximately 200 men had been landed at Mulege from Guaymas.  On 30 September she arrived in the port of Mulege under a flag of truce.  The party led by Lt Tunis A.M. Craven asking the local government to pledge support for the United States as the United States considered the area to be part of the United States. The Mexican Privateer ''Magdelina'' was confiscated from the port.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nunis&quot;/&gt;{{rp|30–1}}  On 2 October after the refusal by local leaders, fifty sailors plus marines were landed at Mulege, but they were faced by artillery and significant opposition.  Using the excuse of encroaching nightfall at a later date to justify their sudden departure, in truth the Battle of Mulege was a substantial victory for the Mexican forces, hence the current official appellation for the town, i.e., &quot;Heroica Mulege&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nunis&quot;/&gt;{{rp|153–4}}

Another account of the Battle of Mulege provides a different perspective.  USS ''Dale'' commanded by Selfridge on way to Guaymas learned of enemy forces in Mulege with an estimated force of 150 men.  Four boats from ''Dale'' commanded by Lt Craven, under the protective cover of ''Dale'' commandeered a Mexican schooner without resistance.  The Following day, 1 October 1847, Lt Craven with 50 sailors plus marines landed.  Under barrage of round shell and shot from ''Dale'' the Mexican forces abandoned the village and were pursued up the valley by Lt Craven's forces.  Craven's forces scoured the valley for a distance of about three miles coming under occasional light assault from ambush.  Lt Craven, fearing the possibility than his men were being led into an ambush, returned with his men to ''Dale''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;/&gt;{{rp|72–3}}  Lt Craven when patrolling later off Mulege on the ''Liberta'' gathered intelligence that actually only 100 fighters were in the Mulege area on 2 Oct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nunis&quot;/&gt;{{rp|33}}

''Dale'' arrived in Guaymas on 8 November 1847 relieving ''Portsmouth'' from guarding the port.  Commander Selfridge, under cover fire from ''Dale'', captured the town of Guaymas.  The only American injury was a musket shot in Commander Selfridge's foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;/&gt;{{rp|73}}  Following the ending of the war in February 1848, ''Dale'' continued to patrol until the summer of 1849, when she sailed for the east coast, arriving at New York on 22 August 1849.  ''Dale'' was placed in ordinary at New York from August 1849 – August 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS1&quot;/&gt;

==African Anti Slavery==
''Dale'' made three extended cruises along the African coast as part of the [[Africa Squadron]] and [[Atlantic Anti-Slavery Operations of the United States]] to suppress the slave trade. In August 1850 she was recommissioned and left for the [[Cape Verde]] Islands to relieve the [[USS Yorktown (1839)|USS ''Yorktown'']]. On 8 October 1850, upon arriving in the Cape Verde Islands, ''Dale'' picked up the survivors of the ''Yorktown'' on [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio Island]].  The ''Yorktown'' sunk, without loss of life, on an unmarked reef one mile north of Maio Island 33 days previous.  The ''Yorktown''’s crew were transported by ''Dale'' to [[Praia|Porto Praya]] where the [[USS John Adams (1799)|USS ''John Adams'']] transported them back to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHParker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parker |first1=William Harwar |authorlink1=William Harwar Parker |title=Recollections of a naval officer, 1841–1865 |url=https://archive.org/details/recollnavalofficer00parkrich |accessdate=29 May 2012 |year=1883 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York City |pages=148–152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the end of this tour ''Dale'' [[Johanna Expedition#Expedition|bombarded]] the small [[Comoros Islands|Kingdom of Johanna]], in August 1851.  While part of the African Squadron in 1851 she sailed {{convert|28313|mi|km}} and 252 days averaging {{convert|112|mi|km}} per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canney&quot;/&gt;  ''Dale'' reportedly captured the slave ship ''W.G. Lewis'' 6 November 1857 off the coast of [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]].  ''Dale'' went out of commission in May 1859

==American Civil War==
[[File:USS Dale (1839) at Naval Academy.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|USS ''Dale'' at Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD]]
''Dale'' was recommissioned on 30 June 1861 at [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]], Kittery, Maine, and sailed to join the [[South Atlantic Blockading Squadron]], capturing two [[schooner]]s on her passage to [[Port Royal, South Carolina]]. Here she served as store and guard ship until sailing north for repairs on 30 September 1862.  After repairs ''Dale'' arrived at [[Key West]] on 10 December for duty as ordnance store ship until 3 July 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyllie|first1=Arthur|title=The Union Navy|date=2007|publisher=Lulu|location=Raleigh, NC|isbn=978-1-4303-2117-0|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EnSAlDbRcyIC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=uss+dale+1839&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TTW70EgINX&amp;sig=xmRHPjSHn7BC054c8k00k5AZJxs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D_CUU_3nE6mksQSnlYDQCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=uss%20dale%201839&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of Career in Navy==
[[File:USS Dale (1839) at DC.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|USS ''Dale'' as receiving ship Washington Naval Yard, Washington DC]]
''Dale'' was decommissioned again at [[Philadelphia]] on 20 July 1865, and was in ordinary at Norfolk until recommissioned on 29 May 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS1&quot;/&gt;  While at Norfolk on 22 January 1886, Landsman [[Joseph H. Davis]] rescued a fellow sailor from drowning, for which he was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;moh&quot;/&gt;  ''Dale'' was recommissioned to serve as a training ship at the [[United States Naval Academy]] [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland|MD]], until 1884.  After leaving Annapolis ''Dale'' served as a receiving ship at [[Washington Navy Yard]] until 1894.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS1&quot;/&gt;

==After the Navy==
Dale was transferred to the [[Maryland Naval Militia]] in 1895, and renamed ''Oriole'' on 30 November 1904.  ''Dale'' was struck from the Navy List 27 February 1906 and on 23 July 1906 she was transferred to the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] at [[Baltimore]], MD.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavSource&quot;/&gt; She, along with the ''Salmon P. Chase'', served as a dormitory-barracks ship for the cadets in the School of Instruction at Arundel Cove, Maryland.  Due to open seems, ''Oriole'' required almost constant operation of her bilge pump, or she would sink at the dock.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot;/&gt; Finally, on 17 September 1921, almost 82 since her launch, ''Oriole'' was returned to the US Navy and sold as a hulk to Mr. William Mattson of Baltimore.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS2&quot;/&gt;
