== The &quot;Vulcan Howl&quot; ==

One of the more distinctive features of the Vulcan is the &quot;Vulcan Howl&quot;. A serendipitous arrangement in engine ducting causes it to make a distinctive howl as the engine approaches full power due to [[sympathetic resonance]]. This is not a phenomenon unique to the Vulcan, but it is prominent and tends to be a signature event at public displays during takeoff and flybys.

I don't know if it has been discussed/debated in the past, but I'd like to tack a paragraph somewhere. It's a bit difficult to find a good cite because its not noteworthy from a historical or military standpoint. However, its prominence in the Vulcan makes it very popular in the context of public perception, so it may be best suited for the &quot;pop culture&quot; section. Here is a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_ARSE8jEHQ good example video on Youtube]. Since it is retired from service, its main use is public display as a national symbol, making its distinctive, crowd-pleasing howl a notable aspect.

As an outsider to the topic, I'd appreciate any edits or clarification from one more knowledgeable, especially a source detailing the technical aspects. All I can find are informal accounts by spectators. [[User:Syd Midnight|&amp;#32;- Syd]] ([[User talk:Syd Midnight|talk]]) 22:06, 8 January 2014 (UTC)
:I added a paragraph with good references to the [[XH558]] section, which seemed slightly more appropriate than Pop Culture. My poor formatting could probably use tidying up by someone with better skills though, thanks! [[User:Syd Midnight|&amp;#32;- Syd]] ([[User talk:Syd Midnight|talk]]) 03:42, 11 January 2014 (UTC)

::IIRC, the 'howl' is due to the (albeit enlarged) air inlets being unable to handle the even larger airflow required by the ~20,000lb st Olympus 301's that were developed for the later-cancelled Skybolt carrier, the B.2 aircraft utilising these engines as they became available. The 'howl' noise is caused by turbulence within the intakes as the engines at full power suck in air slightly faster than the intakes can handle comfortably. The noise is only made at high power and is not otherwise a problem and so the inlets were never further enlarged for the 301's greater air requirements. The 301's were used in the B.2 despite the Skybolt being cancelled because they gave a useful increase in ceiling, as well as more power for climb and manoeuvring at high altitudes and high weights, albeit with somewhat higher fuel consumption.


Just for reference - I have heard the Vulcan Howl, and I can report that whilst watching an F22 practice for the Farnbrough Airshow that it exhibited a very similar phenomenon. It was at slow speed, accelerating, the engines could be heard to spin up rapidly and just as it reached crescendo there was the characteristic momentary sharp, high-pitched howl. 
Im not on the Lockheed engineering team or anything, but the sound definitely had similar characteristics, it happened in similar circumstances and the mechanism given above could easily and plausibly be present.
Its sweet really, of the americans, to make us a baby Vulcan![[Special:Contributions/94.175.244.252|94.175.244.252]] ([[User talk:94.175.244.252|talk]]) 13:56, 8 April 2015 (UTC)

:I should perhaps also have mentioned that with the Olympus 301's the B.2 was by bomber standards somewhat overpowered, even when fully loaded, and in level flight at low level could reach its limiting Mach number simply by leaving the throttles fully open for too long.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/95.148.220.13|95.148.220.13]] ([[User talk:95.148.220.13|talk]]) 23:04, 1 November 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Armament ==

The section on armament seems to neglect to mention the WE177 bomb.

: Was it carried, can you source it?  My vague recollection is that the Vulcan had gone from free-fall nukes before the WE.177 came in. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 10:58, 14 June 2015 (UTC)
:: Its already started in the text of this article that the Vulcan carried the WE177 weapon.  The problem is that this detail is missing
from the ARMAMENT section.  The addition needs to be made to the ARMAMENT section.[[Special:Contributions/2A02:C7D:A8BF:4100:ACC3:E1AF:886D:27B5|2A02thw WE:C7D:A8BF:4100:ACC3:E1AF:886D:27B5]] ([[User talk:2A02:C7D:A8BF:4100:ACC3:E1AF:886D:27B5|talk]]) 15:35, 1 November 2015 (UTC)
::: It's unsourced. Also the WE.177 isn't a single weapon, it's a broad term for three completely different physics packages, albeit in much the same casing. As their tactical functions were so different, I'm not aware of any aircraft that carried all three. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 20:22, 1 November 2015 (UTC)
:::::For your info Andy the Wiki WE.177 article lists the Avro Vulcan as being a carrier for the WE177.  It also cites a few aircraft which were specified to carry all three variants.[[Special:Contributions/2A02:C7D:A8BF:4100:486B:C927:236D:30A8|2A02:C7D:A8BF:4100:486B:C927:236D:30A8]] ([[User talk:2A02:C7D:A8BF:4100:486B:C927:236D:30A8|talk]]) 20:37, 7 November 2015 (UTC)

::::The article states:
:::::After the British Polaris submarines became operational and Blue Steel was taken out of service in 1970, the Vulcan continued to carry WE.177B in a tactical nuclear strike role as part of the British contribution to Europe's standing NATO forces, although they no longer held aircraft at 15 minutes readiness in peacetime.[146] Two squadrons were also stationed in Cyprus as part of the Near East Air Force and assigned to Central Treaty Organization in a strategic strike role. With the eventual demise of the WE.177B and the Vulcan bombers, the Blackburn Buccaneer, SEPECAT Jaguar, and Panavia Tornado, continued with the WE.177C until its retirement in 1998.[148] While not a like-for-like replacement, the multi-role Tornado interdictor/strike bomber is the successor for the roles previously filled by the Vulcan.[149]
::::The Armament sections says:
:::::21 × 1,000 pounds (454 kg) of conventional bombs

:: The article currently mentions the WE177 bomb without citation, but you object to my suggested changes to overcome the inaccuracy of the article on the grounds that I have not supplied suitable citations.  This is an inconsistent approach.  It is clear from the cross references to the Wiki WE177 article that the Avro Vulcan article is deficient.  Using this as a start it will be easy to find valid references to support the improvement of this article.

::I am puzzled by this difficulty. The first mention of the WE.177B in the text is immediately followed by a citation, and subsequent discussions where it crops up appears sensibly cited too.

:::Well done Steelpillow for correcting the article, although I am suprised the changes were not mentioned on these talk pages until now.  You have stated that one WE.177 bomb was carried. Given the payload of the vulcan, the mission objectives and the low weight of a WE.177 it wouldseem likely that more than one would be carried.

== Which Vulcans should have their own articles? ==
The current situation, where Wikipedia has individual aircraft articles on [[Avro Vulcan XH558|XH558]] and [[Avro Vulcan XM655|XM655]] but no others, must confuse the hell out of readers. It certainly did for me, since it fits no natural grouping. I tried to rectify the situation with an [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Avro Vulcan XM655|Afd on XM655]] as the obvious outlier, but that only led to an inconclusive result. I tried to resolve that with [[List of surviving Avro Vulcans#Merge Avro Vulcan XM655|a merge discussion]], but that is yet again simply avoiding the main issue - why XH558 and XM655 but no others? The only resolution I can think of which will actually serve readers is to identify here and now which groups ''should'' have articles. So please indicate which group(s) you want to have articles on, with reasoning. Please don't suggest 'none', since I think it's obvious given its own individual history that there's no way that the article on XH558 is ever getting deleted/merged. Give whatever reason you think makes sense, but I will be asking someone to officially declare the outcome, so bear that in mind. Once they declare the result, I will make sure it is acted upon, even if that means doing all the bloody work myself (since nobody else here seems all that bothered if what they say should/could happen, never actually does happen, even on a timescale of half a decade).

* Group 1 : XH558 only - as the only Vulcan which flew after 1993 (from 2007 to 2015)
* Group 2 : XH558 and XL426 - being the only Vulcans which flew after 1984 (with the [[Vulcan Display Flight]])
* Group 3 : XH558, XM655 and XL426 - being the only three taxi-able examples left
* Group 4 : XM597 and XM607, being the only Vulcans to drop bombs in anger
* Group 5 : All surviving aircraft - see [[List of surviving Avro Vulcans]] (includes Groups 3 and 4)
* Any other group you can think of which makes some kind of sense - e.g. the scale prototypes (survivors or all), the full size prototypes (two, both scrapped), other notable aircraft since scrapped, the aircraft scrapped in preservation, etc, etc

My personal preference is Group 1, since I simply don't see the depth of coverage others claim exists for any other aircraft - what I have seen out there could easily be accommodated in expanded entries the list (one source was pointed out in the merge, but I had already seen that and discounted it as being no more detailed than what is available out there for XL426 and others listed above, including from the very same book).

*Only G-VLCN is notable enough for a stand-alone article, very few other Vulcans are notable enough for a mention and if they are they should be in the main article. The list of survivors is a bit of a mess as it doesnt follow the normal convention for such articles, just because an aircraft survives doent make it notable enough to fill the article with trivia on its history.

::Again? I don't recall anyone ever agreeing with this accusation of yours in the first place. If you cared at all about other people's time, you wouldn't have objected to my Afd of the now gone appearance list (since I only did that to avoid wasting hundreds of hours finishing it), you would have also included enough independent sources on the 655 article in the first place to avoid an Afd, and you wouldn't still be pretending like it's not an issue that you evidently want to leave it to others to decide if they want to properly finish that (or any others so it looks less like an outlier with reference to the above groups). Just like the appearance list, I'm happy to do this work if nobody else can be bothered (even after they claim at Afd it could/should be done), but I'm not going to do it unless I'm sure I'm not going to be wasting my time on articles that will ultimately be merged/deleted. The merge discussion wasn't addressing that, even though people could surely see that was what I wanted comments to address, so I've changed tack to make it absolutely explicit. Sorry if that upsets you to the point of making unfounded accusations again, but one look at your contributions shows that coming here to berate me wasn't exactly taking you away from any other active projects. I don't think anyone else but you is going to have a problem with me shutting down a discussion of my own making after just 3 days and 3 comments on those grounds. But hey, this is Wikipedia, who knows what people will say about anything, or how much sense it will make given the already established facts which people take a lot of time to detail for their sole benefit - that sort of utter pointlessness and its inherent time wasting seems to be all just part of the fun here.

::At this point I think it's you who is incompetent. You created the article on XM655 without including any independent references, contrary to WP:N, and without apparently noticing the contradiction it set up in Wikipedia's overall coverage of individual Vulcans, which, even if it's not against any Wikipedia rule, is just bizarre to say the least. You're now standing by that judgement 5 years on using an argument no more developed than this idea that on Wikipedia nobody can be forced to do anything if they don't want to (which I regard as nothing but open contempt for both readers and the entire principle that this is meant to be a coherent reference work). You're also still insisting that I have wasted other people's time - yet it seems beyond you to factor in all the time I have wasted by doing things like asking people how they intend to decide what was a major appearance or not, getting nothing but silence in response. You have certainly repeatedly disregarded the many many hours I've put in, while arguing here that it's a major crime to get three people to write one line opinions, just to give views which were no different to what they had already said in the Afd. As such, I have no issue in shutting down that merge discussion - you can object to that all you want, I'm frankly not remotely interested unless/until you accept that the discussion was not meant to be a re-run of the Afd, which it quickly turned into. If you have some way to force people to discuss the merge with reference to the actual issues in play, then I'll listen. But it doesn't seem to me like you're interested in doing any that at all, it's all just considered 'disruption' by you. You seem to be only interested in frustrating my efforts to have any of these issues discussed at all. It's quite clear to me your only interest here is to stop me doing anything, because you still apparently believe this ridiculous notion that I am somehow anti-Vucan, an accusation which doesn't stand up to any scrutiny. I am the only person here who seems to currently want to write anything about Vulcans, I just want other people to make some actual decisions that would help me do that. I fully appreciate you don't care about my time, and you don't care if readers can't make any sense out of the seemingly random decision to have articles only on XH558 and XM655, but I am hoping others have more appreciation of what's best for Wikipedia.

::Actions do speak louder than words. You point to rules that support you, while ignoring ones that don't. You complain about your time, while ignoring mine. You point to my attempted deletion of XM655, while ignoring all the other things I've done to EXPAND Wikipedia's coverage of Vulcans, and indeed the fact that the Afd has not concluded it should exist - a merge discussion was the mandated outcome. Indeed, you (quite deliberately imho) have completely ignored the fact I didn't even delete one word of that XM655 article, I simply moved it into the list, word for word, including the bits people have already identified as needing a source. You point to my deletion of the appearance list, while again (quite deliberately imho) ignoring the fact that I expanded it (before and after splitting) and gave it a consistent format, and was only putting up for deletion to test whether or not the hundreds of hours it would take to have completed it would have been worth my time. Turns out it wouldn't have been. I'm happy for a merge discussion for XM655 to proceed, if it actually takes the form of a merge discussion, rather than simply a rather weak attempt to justify the continued existence of XM655 as a separate article without any attempt to address the major flaws it exposes in the present day coverage of Vulcans on Wikipedia (and the still remaining basic fact that as it stands, the article fails WP:N by still only being sourced to the preservation society's website - just like the now deleted XL426 before it!). I know you'd have no issue if I myself decided to improve what you apparently don't want to, and both add independent sources and more words to XM655, and indeed create a similar article for the similar plane XL426 so the situation is less baffling to readers, but unlike you, I can see just how little coverage there is out there on both (about a 1/10th of what there is for XH558), and I can see all the people here and at the Afd who said that because of that, it would not be an acceptable approach to take, and instead both should be mentioned simply in the survivor list. If you were in any way interested in building consensus rather than just continuing with these pretty one-sided critiques of my actions aimed at solely removing me as a threat to the continued existence of XM655 as a separate page, you'd have come up with some suggestion as to how to square this circle. I simply think you're not doing this because you realise it's an argument you can't win, so the ridiculously poor status quo is the best outcome for you, unless/until more people can be found who agree with you. You might not agree, and others here may have not even understood the question, but the entire purpose of this section was to establish consensus as of right now, how to square this circle. Because like it or not, doing nothing and hoping other people fix it, is clearly not an effective strategy. As least not if you desire fixes that take less than a decade.

Having not looked at and not caring either way about any of the specified articles, I say Other. Any airframe that meets the Wikipedia notability inclusion guidelines (&quot;If a topic has received '''significant coverage''' in '''reliable sources''' that are '''independent of the subject'''&quot;, from [[Wikipedia:Notability#General notability guideline]], emphasis in original), and is the subject of enough content ''unique to that airframe'' to justify an article-sized block of text, should be considered suitable for an article. That said, please remember that [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is a volunteer service|We Are All Volunteers]], and those volunteers have a wide range of interests and levels of input. As with any contributor, I can and will write and expand that articles I want to, when I want to; no contributor should feel like they have a shotgun (metaphorical or otherwise) held to their head by another contributor insisting that ''their'' preferred articles be worked on ''now''. Also, with as little offence as possible meant, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Military_history&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=695258138&amp;oldid=695219468 request for input] posted to the Milhist wikiproject is one of the most loaded and drama-inciting pieces of text I've seen on a project talkpage in recent times.

:I fully considered WP:N when drawing up the various groupings above. I have researched the Vulcans a lot already to improve the XH558 article and create the survivor list, so I can confidently say that the groups I identified above all have similar levels of notability in terms of depth of coverage. The 'Other' option was for people who might know more, it's not there for people who just want to assume I've not done my own research and/or just want to state the obvious (WP:N=article). There needs to be a decision here and now about which groups pass the bar of WP:N, since the XM655 Afd showed there are people who are quite happy to interpret it in all sorts of ways, depending on whether they want none, some or all aircraft to have their own article. That is stupid, but the current situation is even more idiotic - wherever the bar is drawn, the coverage out there does not justify a conclusion that only XH558 and XM655 are notable. Either X655 is not notable, which is imho the case given people's reluctance to actually go into any detail about what coverage is out there on it, or other aircraft in other groups should also have their own articles. I don't want to force anyone to do anything - I only ask that people consider how infuriating it is for people like me, who are actually wanting to improve Wikipedia by fixing idiotic situations like this by actually writing whichever articles it is deemed are missing, do actually need definitive answers to questions like this. I have wasted enough time already by simply going ahead and doing things without settling issues like this in advance. [[User:Natural Ratio|Natural Ratio]] ([[User talk:Natural Ratio|talk]]) 22:38, 15 December 2015 (UTC)

This is a bit of an odd discussion: we can have articles on all the Vulcans which meet WP:N, and don't need to pick subjects in advance. I have no idea what the availability of in-depth sourcing on individual Vulcans is, but that's basically what this boils down to.

*'''Other: per [[WP:NOTABILITY]]'''. I agree with Saberwyn and Nick-D. This idea of a beauty contest between Vulcans is going about things the wrong way. Each Vulcan must be taken on its encyclopedic merits. Are there adequate reliable sources ([[WP:RS]]) to demonstrate its notability? If so, can it be sensibly merged in with this article or would that mess this article up too much? If it messes this article up in one way or another then it needs to be split off to another article. Any confusion in navigating the resultant set of articles can be resolved using the various techniques at our disposal: links where a given airframe is mentioned, &quot;Main article&quot; links in the [[List of surviving Avro Vulcans]]. [[WP:REDIRECT|redirects]] from individual serials that have no article of their own, maybe a [[:Category:Avro Vulcans]], and so on. Readers who are still confused can ask for clarification on the associated talk pages and navigational improvements made accordingly. Any article seen as over-enthusiastic can be subject to AfD debate and that is that. What articles we end up with and how we avoid confusion thus falls out of the encyclopedic process and not out of some editorial opinion. And yes, the drama queen antics of {{User|Natural Ratio}} are indeed becoming disruptive and they need to stop. &amp;mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 10:42, 15 December 2015 (UTC)

::See above. I have fully considered notability in choosing those groups and identifying the current situation as absurd. The potential for confusion does not lie in the difficulty in finding/navigating between articles, it comes about because people are insisting that the status quo is acceptable, that it will make some kind of sense to readers. It does not. The current situation will confuse readers who have read the main article and the list of survivors, because it suggests to them that they should be able to find articles here for all aircraft in Group 3 or perhaps even Group 4. As you can see, they cannot. Why not? [[User:Natural Ratio|Natural Ratio]] ([[User talk:Natural Ratio|talk]]) 22:38, 15 December 2015 (UTC)
:::The thing is, before you can identify some group or other of Vulcans here, you have to establish the notability of that group ''as an identified group''. In the end it always comes back to the sources. While notability may seem static and uninspiring as an end point, it really helps to direct the ''process'' - how can I represent the reliable sources a little bit better than yesterday? Just let the content shape itself as it grows: find content worth adding and add it to a suitable article - if you get stuck, ask where best to put it. On occasion, some restructuring may fall out of that - ''this'' article is unbalanced, ''that'' article is covered better elsewhere, etc. But the stalemate running throughout the current round of discussions shows clearly that this is not the right moment for the restructuring you have in mind. For my own part, I would:
:::#Take up MilborneOne's suggestion that few if any of the surviving Vulcans are notable, and perhaps take that to the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft|Aircraft Wikiproject talk page]] to confirm consensus on what criteria we accept for identifying a given airframe as significant enough to list and discuss.
:::#In the light of that, review the notability of the [[List of surviving Avro Vulcans]].
:::#If the list survives that, consider renaming it as [[Surviving Avro Vulcans]], with the summary list itself as a section within the larger article.
:::#If the content on any particular airframe unbalances the reshaped article, hive it off as a standalone page. OTOH, if a standalone page can genuinely be merged back in without spoiling the shape, then by all means take that up again in the revised context - consensus (or lack of it) is never set in stone.
:::You say that you have thought about the notability aspect, but that was not made clear in your opener for this discussion, you talked more about &quot;natural grouping&quot;. Had you asked us about &quot;notable grouping&quot; and where to look for sources, I am sure we would have responded accordingly. My own suspicion is that &quot;surviving Vulcans&quot; is about as good as it gets, and even there MilborneOne has raised doubts. This is where the WikiProject can be useful in confirming the ground rules. Anyway, that's how I see it. &amp;mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 10:12, 16 December 2015 (UTC)
::::While you are correct that I wasn't explicit in explaining that the groups I identified above all correspond to similar levels of notability, the fact that I had already nominated XM655 on grounds of notability, and that I mentioned coverage in the last paragraph to justify my preference for Group 1, should have really made it clear. That said, on past experience, and again based on this section, I'm getting the sense that no matter how carefully or at length you explain yourself on Wikipedia, nobody bothers to even read it. Even after clarifying that I am talking about notability, the only responses since then have merely repeated the fact that the 'answer' here is 'duh, notability!'. Essentially on Wikipedia, it seems like you just have to decide whether you want to waste your time first, because the only way anyone else is going to give concrete feedback, is after you've actually done something which potentially might have taken hundreds of hours. Which is ridiculous. There are lots of independent sources out there, with lots of detail. Quite clearly anyone could use those to write a hell of a lot on at least 5 surviving Vulcans, perhaps a few more. And if they follow your logic, since that would 'unbalance' the list by spoiling it's 'shape' (I'm still not seeing where that is codified as a concept here at all?), that would mean the creation of several new articles would be required. And quite clearly, nobody here is going to bother saying whether that would be a good thing or not, until it happens. Which is ridiculous. Frankly, I'm not seeing any avenue, any project, and proposed form of question, which will help me (or any other gullible fool) simply avoid wasting a hell of a lot of time in advance, should they make the wrong choice, a choice that ultimately doesn't stand the test of time regarding WP:N, should anyone put the articles up for deletion. I'm happy with Group 1 and the list of survivors as being sufficient to deal with how outside sources give them coverage, I simply don't see how anyone here is going to succeed in deleting either. It is other people who have created the issue here, such as yourself, by insisting that the current situation of having just two articles (XH558 and XM655) somehow makes sense. The only way the current situation makes ANY SENSE AT ALL is if XM655 is considered notable (and as seen in the Afd, there is no agreement on that), and then someone creates an article for XL426 to complete the set of Group 3. Yet nobody here seems to want to do that, or even say that should be done to give me the confidence to actually do it, in the face of several people here saying that even one article is too many. As it stands, you're recommending I follow the advice of MilborneOne, yet here I am, still waiting to find out where this list convention is - explicit questions like that seem to get completely ignored here. And his opinion on the notability goes against you too, unless you've now changed your mind about XM655? I certainly don't understand what either of you are proposing re. 'Surviving Avro Vulcans', that makes no sense to me as a proposed article. A list is the obvious natural presentation there, which is presumably why there are so many others here already - [[:Category:Lists of surviving military aircraft]]. a quick scan of those doesn't identify any convention other than dividing by country and condition, which seems redundant in this case. I certainly get no impression that excluding non-notable aircraft is done at all. It makes no sense to me, and doesn't seem to be the practice of any other author either. With historic aircraft like this, quite obviously it will be noticed if complete airframes survive, and efforts will be made to document them all, even if all that can be said is, it exists and this is its number, location and basic history (built, retired, squadrons).

:::::A few thoughts arising:
:::::[[WP:PAGEDECIDE]], [[WP:SPINOFF]] and [[WP:UNDUE]] all discuss aspects of whether a notable topic should be subsumed into a more general article or needs to be given a standalone article. That might help to show what I mean by &quot;balance&quot;.
:::::If you have an idea for say a new article or other significant change, don't agonise over its acceptability, take it to a suitable talk page to get some feedback on ''the specific proposal''. This one from bitter experience: if answers are universally off the point, this is usually because one hasn't asked the right question. Best thing is to reflect carefully on where communications broke down, and then try to ask the right question. Communication skills don't come easy to some people, who can find this bit very taxing (for my part, any such skills as I may have were acquired slowly over many difficult years). Best not to be in a hurry, is my experience. Maybe the question here should have been, '''Should XL426 have its own article, like XM655?''' making the point that the article on XM655 has little as yet to justify it so why not XL426 too? (This suggestion comes without warranty!)
:::::I take your point about [[:Category:Lists of surviving military aircraft]]. Wiser to run with the herd at this point unless one wants to question its direction as a specific issue. But in general, I don't expect consistency to come easy on Wikipedia! The content is driven by the near-anarchic creation process and by conflicting agendas within that process. I have often seen consistency and good sense come and go with the ebb and flow of the tides.

::::Christ. It's somewhat complex, hence the need for quite a few words, but it's surely not that hard to understand? Currently, Wikipedia has individual articles on XH558 and XM655. This is monumentally stupid, as anyone who has briefly researched Vulcans could tell you. XH558 is hugely notable, for reasons which are detailed in its article. XM655 is less notable, and has similar amounts of coverage as XL426. Why? Because they (along with XH558 now) are the only other Vulcans still capable of taxiing under their own power - all other surviving Vulcans are static exhibits (and have been, AFAIK, ever since their various handovers from the RAF to their new owners). Only a few Vulcans survived. Only a few Vulcans were used in anger. Only two survivors were used in anger (XM607 and XM597). For the purposes of WP:N, the coverage out there of individual Vulcans reflects these facts (mostly as chapters or paragraphs in books about Vulcans in general), as you would expect. I tried to resolve this issue by putting XM655 up for deletion, but it ended inconclusively - evidently it should not be deleted because some people gave some pretty vague (and completely unsubstantiated) claims that there is enough specific coverage of it out there, but it could be merged. When I duly suggested it be merged, people ignored the issue of XL462 or other Vulcans and instead just repeated the arguments they made in the Afd that it is notable in its own right, even though not one person seems at all interested in adding a single word, or a single source, to the XM655 article, or creating any articles for any other Vulcan with similar amounts of coverage (because, hey, Wikipedia is not school! or something). Because I do care about readers and do not want them needlessly confused, I am prepared to fix this idiotic situation by improving XM655 and creating XL462 and indeed any other article on any other Vulcan deemed notable. But mindful of the fact there are several people here who do not think either article should exist (and even that XH558 should not!), I am not prepared to spend the many hours to that, without a definitive consensus here as to which ones are notable - and for convenience I put forth my knowledge about which groups have similar levels of coverage. The answer that 'all Vulcans which meet WP:N are notable' is not helping the situation one bit because different people set the bar differently, as seen in the XM655 Afd. Other than creating beginner articles on every survivor and then putting every one up for deletion to actually force people to go look at the coverage of each for themselves (which would no doubt be greeted by Martin et al with shrieks of time wasting 'disruption'!), I see no other way of answering this question. But if it cannot be answered, Wikipedia's coverage of Vulcans will continue to look stupid to semi-knowledgeable readers, if not a little bit suspect (since the only references used in the XM655 article are to its owner's website, something which could be done for every single survivor that resides in a museum). And needless to say, it is obviously misleading to readers who know nothing at all about Vulcans, who must be wondering what it is about XM655 that makes it more notable than any of the other survivors (including the similarly capable XL426) or indeed any of the now scrapped aircraft that actually dropped bombs.

===Significance of the list and of the individual aircraft===
Duncan Cubitt and Ken Ellis; ''Vulcan: Last of the V-bombers'', 2nd Edition, Bounty Books, 2014 (2nd printing 2016). This book devotes three chapters explicitly to the surviving Vulcans, including; XJ823, XJ824, XL318, XL319, XL360, XL391, XL426, XM569, XM575, XM594, XM597, XM598, XM603, XM607, XM612, XM655, XM605 -606 and -573 (USA), XL361 (Canada), and of course XH558 which gets one of those chapters all to itself. I have not yet compared that list to the [[List of surviving Avro Vulcans]], but its history of five print runs over two editions certainly supports the notability both of the list and of XH558. Doesn't help the others to justify their own articles, though. &amp;mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 21:44, 18 December 2015 (UTC) P.S. &quot;2nd printing 2016&quot;? That's what it says. And to think that Hollywood used a car to go back to the future, huh! &amp;mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 21:46, 18 December 2015 (UTC)
:It is fairly normal to list aircraft on display so having a list is not a problem, as I mentioned before we do have an issue in trying to write a complete history of every aircraft on display, the fact they have survived is normally of note but shoe horning complete histories of each airframe into the list article is not something we normally do.

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Avro Vulcan]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=697801302 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20070318044222/http://www.raf.mod.uk:80/falklands/bb.html to http://www.raf.mod.uk/falklands/bb.html

==Personal reminiscences==
Someone has recently added a paragraph referenced solely to personal reminiscences. The paragraph was then tagged as being unsourced, and in response, the original editor removed the tag. When I attempted to cut down the information to something that could be sourced to a [[wp:reliable source]], {{user|Andy Dingley}} reverted to the version with the unreferenced paragraph, removing references in the process.l This is meant to be a Good Article - as such, badly referenced material such as this isn't really acceptable, and if it remains, the article should be delisted.[[User:Nigel Ish|Nigel Ish]] ([[User talk:Nigel Ish|talk]]) 14:02, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
: It reads better in the expanded version. You removed this as &quot;duplication&quot;, which it very much isn't - more detail on the same topic is not the same thing.
: &quot;Good article&quot; shouldn't (but frequently does) mean &quot;ossified&quot;. Nor is this a &quot;good&quot; article - there's far too much missing (It doesn't even mention Giant Voice and the development history is extremely thin. I doubt it was even a &quot;good&quot; article by the standards of articles five years ago. One area where it's particularly weak is in the later MR role. Your edit, in particular, conflates the MR North Sea patrols and the strategic sniffing detachments overseas. Apart from one inheriting some kit from the other, those are about as different as recon roles get.
: If you want more sources, then fine, add more sources. It's a Vulcan - there's no shortage of written words about them. But move ''forwards''. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 14:14, 6 March 2016 (UTC)</text>
