'''Erik-Ørn Gjems-Onstad''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (22 February 1922 – 18 November 2011) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance member]], officer, lawyer, sports official, politician, author and anti-immigration activist.

Gjems-Onstad joined the Norwegian resistance movement after [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Weserübung|invaded]] Norway in 1940. He was arrested in [[Sweden]] for his involvement with Norwegian resistance activity in the country in 1941, and was sent to the [[United Kingdom]] where he joined the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]] (''Kompani Linge'') and received British military training. He was deployed to Norway in 1943 as part of [[Lark (Norwegian resistance)|Lark]], assigned with establishing radio connection with [[London]]. He led Lark in [[Trøndelag]] between 1943 and 1945, which constituted the leadership of [[Milorg]] in the region. His other activities included to assist with weapons smuggling, prepare the sinking of the German battleship ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]'' and plotting to assassinate Nazi collaborator [[Ivar Grande]]. He also founded the [[Durham (Norwegian resistance)|Durham]] organisation for conducting [[psychological warfare]] towards the end of the war, and he took part in blowing up railway tracks. Gjems-Onstad's efforts during the [[World War II|Second World War]] led him to become one of Norway's highest decorated war heroes.

He joined the [[Home Guard (Norway)|Norwegian Home Guard]] after the war, where he served as a captain. He completed education in [[law]], and also worked as a judge and lawyer. He ultimately reached the rank of colonel in the military, as military lawyer of a branch of the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]]. For some years he was CEO of a project that planned to develop the [[Vaterland, Norway|Vaterland]] neighbourhood in Oslo. Gjems-Onstad also had a career in sports, representing the sports club [[SK Rye]] in [[cycling]] and [[racewalking]]. He later worked as a sports official as board member and chairman of various national sports bodies.

A former member of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] organisation [[Libertas (Norway)|Libertas]], Gjems-Onstad joined [[Progress Party (Norway)|Anders Lange's Party]] when it was founded in 1973 and became the party's deputy leader. He was elected a Member of Parliament in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1973|1973 parliamentary election]], and became the party's [[parliamentary leader]] following [[Anders Lange]]'s death in 1974. Many of his views and proposals caused controversy, and he got in conflict with the new leadership of the party, which was eventually headed by [[Carl I. Hagen]]. Gjems-Onstad was expelled from the party in 1976, and finished his term as an [[independent (politician)|independent]]. He also became known for criticising the Norwegian government's policy in [[Africa]], and for defending the governments of countries such as [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]]. In the 1980s he worked as a defender for several anti-immigration activists, and from the late 1980s he became involved in anti-immigration politics himself. He stood in election for the [[Stop Immigration]] party in 1989 and for the [[Fatherland Party (Norway)|Fatherland Party]] in 1991, and he was later involved in the organisations ''[[Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring]]'' and [[Stop Islamisation of Norway]]. He was briefly active locally in the Conservative Party and the [[Pensioners' Party (Norway)|Pensioners' Party]] in the late 2000s.

==Early life==
Erik-Ørn Gjems-Onstad was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (modern-day Oslo) to jurist and civil servant Olaf Gjems-Onstad (1882–1945) and architect Ågot Urbye (1886–1959). He worked at sea as a [[cabin boy]] in 1937, and went to port in both [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Akseptering av andres meninger|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=70995&amp;page=15&amp;date=16.2.1993|date=16 February 1993|accessdate=24 November 2011|language=Norwegian|page=15|first=Erik|last=Gjems-Onstad|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1940.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Gjems-Onstad was active in the [[Scouting|boy scouts]] before the invasion, and he was because of his experience there asked to instruct in map and compass for a volunteer military training program in late 1939. He thereafter became [[Scout Leader|scout leader]] as the former leader went to fight in the [[Winter War]]. Due to the war in Europe, the scout exercises became increasingly serious,&lt;ref name=go199113/&gt; and the scout movement arguably had a big part in the early organisation of the Norwegian resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gjems-Onstad&quot;&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1939/40, Gjems-Onstad commenced training in [[orienteering]] and signaling during the night.&lt;ref name=ego08&gt;{{cite episode |title=Spekter temakveld: Krigsveteran|network=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |station=[[NRK2]] |airdate=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekend before the invasion, he and a friend prepared &quot;for war&quot; by training and sleeping in a tent in the snow in the forest Vestmarka, which was seen as unusual to do at the time.&lt;ref name=go199113/&gt;&lt;ref name=wings/&gt;

==Second World War==

===Early activities===
[[File:German soldiers in Oslo 9 April 1940.jpg|right|thumb|190px|German soldiers marching through Oslo on 9 April 1940. The boy on the bike to the left has traditionally been regarded to be [[Gunnar Sønsteby]], but Gjems-Onstad later claimed he had evidence that it was actually him.&lt;ref name=&quot;morg&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.morgenbladet.no/article/20091016/OAKTUELT/710169929|work=[[Morgenbladet]]|title=Helten som ikke passer inn|first=Simen|last=Sætre|language=Norwegian|date=16 October 2009|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
On 9 April 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Weserübung|invaded]] and [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied Norway]] as a part of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did not get any notification of what was happening, and only music was played on the radio.&lt;ref name=go199113&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ego08/&gt; Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the [[Oslo Cathedral School]], only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and ''[[Karl Johans gate]]'', where he witnessed the Germans marching through.&lt;ref name=ego08/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;morg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The next (or possibly the same) day, a German [[Junkers]] plane crashed near him and his friend when they were on their way from [[Lysaker]] to get a closer view of the captured [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Fornebu Airport]]. He briefly found himself in the situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but the heat was unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gjems-Onstad&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=wings&gt;{{cite book|title=Fornebu 9. april|pages=299–300|publisher=Wings|location=Oslo|first=Cato|last=Guhnfeldt |authorlink=Cato Guhnfeldt |year=1990|isbn=82-992194-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister [[Johan Nygaardsvold]] on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint [[Vidkun Quisling]] as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems-Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected if he had not been through [[recruit training]], and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for [[Northern Norway]]. They came as far north as [[Nord-Trøndelag]], where they however gave up and returned home.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1991, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gjems-Onstad started studying at the [[University of Oslo]] in late 1940, and he got in touch with students who wanted to organise a resistance movement. One time, he and other youth who sympathised with the resistance disrupted a public meeting held by the fascist party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (NS). They deliberately clapped their hands so relentlessly (they considered that they could not get punished for &quot;cheering&quot;) that the speakers could not speak, and thereafter started leaving the room. Many were however blocked from leaving, and Gjems-Onstad and a few others were arrested and fined due to their role in the event. In September he participated in a clash between students and a group of ''[[Hird]]'' members (the NS's paramilitary organisation) outside the university. A young boy came by during the initial stand-off, asking Gjems-Onstad what was happening. Gjems-Onstad responded that the others were traitors, and ''Hird'' members thus captured him and beat him up. Later, due to an outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] in December, Gjems-Onstad took part in digging mass graves for slaughtered cows in [[Dikemark]] and in [[Nesøya, Akershus|Nesøya]].&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1991, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erik Gjems-Onstad.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Erik Gjems-Onstad in the early 1940s.]]
In late 1940, an engineer had created some military inventions which Gjems-Onstad's group wanted to bring to the Allied forces. It was decided that one of them was to travel to the UK, while Gjems-Onstad was to travel to [[Stockholm]]. Gjems-Onstad was joined by three others, and they decided to let themselves be arrested in [[Östmark]] in Sweden. They were transported to Stockholm, but the Norwegian [[legation]] was not interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was later tipped to contact the British [[military attaché]]. He got in contact with Major [[Malcolm Munthe]], who in turn was interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was arrested by Swedish police in Stockholm on 25 March 1941, as parts of Munthe's organisation had been exposed. Gjems-Onstad was imprisoned at the Stockholm police station for 13 days, and then for 59 days in the Stockholm Remand Prison.&lt;ref name=go199119&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 May 1941 the government decided that he was to be expelled and banned from entering Sweden (the ban was repealed after the war).&lt;ref name=go199119/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=52923&amp;page=1&amp;date=12.11.1974|title=Gjems-Onstad utvist på livstid i 1941|language=Norwegian|date=12 November 1974|accessdate=10 December 2011|pages=1 and 19|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally scheduled to be deported to [[Canada]] via [[Moscow]] and [[China]], but the plans were halted due to the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]]. He was instead sent to the Norwegian refugee camp in [[Öreryd]].&lt;ref name=go199119/&gt; He was ordered by the British to escape from Öreryd in October 1941 and travel to Norway. He was captured by the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Swedish Home Guard]] close to the Norwegian border, but was sent by plane to the UK by Swedish authorities in December.&lt;ref name=go199119/&gt;

===In the resistance===
After arriving in the UK, Gjems-Onstad joined the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]] (''Kompani Linge'') and took British military education.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{stortingetbio|ERGJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British decided in 1943 to deploy him to [[Trøndelag]] in Norway together with [[Odd Sørli (Norwegian resistance)|Odd Sørli]], [[Johnny Pevik]] and [[Nils Uhlin Hansen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chr133&quot;&gt;Christensen, 2011, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kl66&gt;Jensen, Ratvik &amp; Ulstein, 1995, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The deployment was necessary as [[Evald Hansen]] and [[Herluf Nygaard]] had been captured and tortured in December 1942 (Nygaard later escaped, Hansen died at [[Falstad concentration camp|Falstad]]).&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, 2011, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Sørli and Gjems-Onstad were set to maintain [[Lark (Norwegian resistance)|Lark]], establish radio connection with London and get intelligence about the German battleship ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]'', at the time located in the [[Trondheimsfjord]].&lt;ref name=kl66/&gt; When he was training at Glen More Lodge near [[Aviemore]], Gjems-Onstad was ordered to go to London, where he was supplied with a 20&amp;nbsp;kg radio transmitter and other equipment. Together with Sørli he travelled to [[Inverness]] by train, and to [[Shetland]] by plane, under stormy weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt; They initially set out with the fishing boat ''Harald II'' from [[Scalloway]] in late February, but due to unusually stormy weather they were driven back to Shetland three times after three unsuccessful attempts to reach [[Ålesund]]; the last attempt destroyed their equipment as the boat was bursted open.&lt;ref name=kl66/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 30–34.&lt;/ref&gt; They had their equipment replaced, and set out for [[Kristiansund]] in March instead on a bigger boat. With easier, yet still poor weather, the voyage took two days. When they reached land they noticed that they had reached [[Kya Lighthouse]], much farther to the north of their original destination, but they decided to make landfall anyway.&lt;ref name=kl66/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; From there they travelled with fake identification via [[Namsos]] to Trondheim, where they reunited with fellow Lark members Johnny Pevik and Nils Uhlin Hansen, the other group sent from London.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Ratvik &amp; Ulstein, 1995, pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad thereafter assisted Pevik and Hansen with transporting five tons of weapons from an uninhabited island near Lyngvær to Trondheim.&lt;ref name=&quot;chr133&quot;/&gt;

Lark received missions from London (sometimes via Stockholm), and constituted the leadership of [[Milorg]] in Trøndelag where they in practice were the same entity.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad started his operations in Trondheim by establishing radio connection with London and operating the radio transmitter,&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; and he soon became one of the most important persons in the leadership of Milorg.&lt;ref&gt;Alming, 1995, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; His saboteur activity included to prepare the sinking of ''Tirpitz'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=40631&amp;page=5&amp;date=22.2.1982|title=Kampglad kriger|language=Norwegian|date=22 February 1982|accessdate=10 December 2011|page=5|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plans were never realised as the ship had left the Trondheimsfjord in early 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Sørli commanded Gjems-Omstad to a spontaneous assassination of Nazi collaborator [[Ivar Grande]] after spotting him incidentally, but Gjems-Onstad aborted after noticing a division of Russian [[Prisoner of war|POWs]], fearing for what in turn might happen to them if he went through with the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Some days later he again plotted to assassinate Grande together with Sørli and Ingebrigt Gausland. They delivered a box [[booby trap]]ped with an egg hand grenade to his home, but Grande foiled the attempt with advice Norwegian [[Gestapo]] agent [[Henry Rinnan]] (who was present at the time) had received on not to open such boxes.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, 2011, pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the attempted assassination, he was ordered to not get himself involved in any further such attempts, as it was considered too risky for him.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad took over as leader of the group from Sørli in October 1943,&lt;ref name=&quot;go1995a&quot;&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1995, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was decided to pull him out of Norway and close the radio station following news that Pevik had been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Ratvik &amp; Ulstein, 1995, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Trondheim for Stockholm later that month, and received training in [[psychological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sørli came to Stockholm in January 1944 he took over for Gjems-Onstad, while Gjems-Onstad was to take over the leadership of Lark as well as to reorganise Milorg.&lt;ref name=&quot;go1990a&quot;&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad also founded the propaganda organisation [[Durham (Norwegian resistance)|Durham]] when he came back to Trondheim in March 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;go1995b&quot;/&gt; Lark and Durham were to be kept completely separate, with Gjems-Onstad as their only mutual connection.&lt;ref name=&quot;go1990a&quot;/&gt; Durham's mission was to influence the moral of the enemy, mainly through distributing brochures (an estimated 115,000 copies in total) and posters (an estimated 257,000), while also to cause irritation by minor sabotage. The brochures were chiefly distributed in the enemy's quarters, and the posters were put up throughout Trondheim.&lt;ref name=&quot;go1995b&quot;&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1995, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the group also tore down Nazi posters, sabotaged German vehicles, threw [[stink bomb]]s into restaurants and cinemas, and applied [[itching powder]]—notably in [[condom]]s for sale to German soldiers. Sabotage on a bigger scale had to be authorised from London, and was largely discouraged as it would risk unnecessary German reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad reported back in Stockholm at the end of June.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Ratvik &amp; Ulstein, 1995, pp. 72–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Eager to bring supplies to Trondheim, he and Sørli soon decided to transport propaganda material, handguns and explosives to the Norwegian border. After finding a lost resistance member in the mountains, Gjems-Onstad joined a course in [[Alby, Botkyrka|Alby]] near Stockholm where he worked as instructor in &quot;silent killing&quot; for a month.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; He went for a short mission to Trondheim in July in order to insert Egil Løkse as Lark's new radio operator there.&lt;ref name=&quot;JRU&quot;&gt;Jensen, Ratvik &amp; Ulstein, 1995, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

By his next time in Trondheim, the Gestapo had gained knowledge of Gjems-Onstad's activities, and did their outermost to capture him.&lt;ref name=&quot;JRU&quot;/&gt; Gjems-Onstad went back to Trondheim at the end of October. He was to establish a new radio station, and investigate if Milorg and Lark could be rebuilt, as the organisation had been severely damaged by multiple arrests and murders.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Ratvik &amp; Ulstein, 1995, pp. 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Durham was however largely intact. The mission went into a new phase, as the Norwegian resistance started organising defence against potential destructions during the now largely inevitable German withdrawal. A continuation of the [[scorched earth]] policy practiced in Northern Norway was particularly feared. Gjems-Onstad and Lark were not to lead the defence, but rather to organise it and train new recruits.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 74–80, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; In November he authorised the creation of the illegal newspaper ''For Friheten'' by his own initiative, the first in Trondheim in years.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; He also operated the paper ''DFP'', or ''Deutsche Freiheitspartei'', a form of [[black propaganda]] distributed to German soldiers and officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Den frie hemmelige pressen i Norge under okkupasjonen 1940-45: en fortellende bibliografi|first=Hans|last=Luihn|publisher=Nasjonalbiblioteket|year=1999|page=40|isbn=82-7965-010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became increasingly frustrated with the damages caused by Rinnan and his gang of Nazi collaborators, and he vocally advocated their assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 98–100, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; He reported back to Stockholm in November, and as he saw it, little remained of Milorg in Trøndelag after this. He however noted the importance of Durham, which he considered to have grown very powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad took part in blowing up railway tracks on the stretches around [[Støren Station]], but the group had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They could for instance not go through with blowing up the railway bridge near [[Hovin, Sør-Trøndelag|Hovin]], which they sought as their main target.&lt;ref name=&quot;go1995c&quot;&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1995, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 142–151.&lt;/ref&gt; He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945,&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Ratvik &amp; Ulstein, 1995, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and Durham was dissolved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alming&quot;&gt;Alming, 1995, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; He reacted with shock that London had decided that it was too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; He was uneasy about being set on the sideline, and headed a mission of four men from Stockholm to [[Namsvatnet]] at the end of the month to receive British sabotage supplies. They established a base of operations, as well as radio connection to the UK by the station ''Quail''. The mission returned to Stockholm in early April, and Gjems-Onstad was transferred to a mission in Northern Norway.&lt;ref name=&quot;go1995c&quot;/&gt; He was in [[Troms]] at the time of the German capitulation.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decorations, comments===
[[File:Krigskorset.jpg|thumb|114px|Gjems-Onstad was awarded the [[War Cross (Norway)|War Cross]], Norway's highest decoration, for his efforts in the war.]]
In 1944 Gjems-Onstad was promoted to second lieutenant (''[[Army ranks and insignia of Norway|fenrik]]''). He was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1941, and decorated with the [[Haakon VII 70th Anniversary Medal]] in 1942, the [[St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch]] in 1944, the [[Defence Medal (United Kingdom)|Defence Medal]], [[War Medal 1939–1945]], [[1939–45 Star]] and the [[Defence Medal 1940–1945|Norwegian Defence Medal]] in 1945 and the [[Norwegian War Cross|Norwegian War Cross with Sword]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; As such he was one of Norway's highest decorated war heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Ny Tid]]|page=63|date=4 April 2008|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=82392&amp;page=55&amp;date=9.4.2008|date=9 April 2008|language=Norwegian|accessdate=3 December 2011|title=Portrett: Erik Gjems-Onstad|page=55|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 he played himself in the [[documentary film]] ''[[Det grodde fram]]'' about the Norwegian resistance movement in Trondheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Adresseavisen|Adresseavisen Morgen]]|date=28 February 2002|first=Tone E.|last=Berg|page=11|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gjems-Onstad became critical of the &quot;retracted regional leadership&quot; of the Home Front (''hjemmefronten'') which he became aware of in late 1944. According to him, he and his fellow resistance members had not even heard of their existence. He sent a wire to London requesting that they should take over what remained of Milorg, rather than remaining passive during the occupation only to step forward as leaders of Milorg when the war was over. He became more critical when he became aware that they had started entering the administration in London and Stockholm, according to him without the necessary experience from practical fieldwork. He was shocked at the recklessness of one of them who arrived at one of their bases in Trondheim, concluding that they &quot;obviously had no idea about how strong the infiltration really was in Trondheim, nor how we worked.&quot; The regional leadership that stepped forward after the war was according to Gjems-Onstad not identical with the actual leadership of Lark and Milorg during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 117–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have noted that it was &quot;very surprising&quot; that [[Erling Gjone]] stepped forward as the leader of the Home Front in Trøndelag after the German capitulation. He had entered the administration in Stockholm in February 1945, but he had not been contacted whatsoever by Lark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alming&quot;/&gt; The decision of putting Gjems-Onstad on the sideline in March 1945 led him to become increasingly critical of the leadership in London, which had gradually become more Norwegian than British, and subsequently decayed into what Gjems-Onstad considered to be a lack of professionality. He also questioned Norway's military abilities in a possible future war in Norway, based on post-war developments.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gjems-Onstad, what influenced him and his contemporaries to join the resistance was a national feeling that—speaking some 60 years after war—he then considered that was &quot;almost gone.&quot;&lt;ref name=ego08/&gt;

Gjems-Onstad deliberated his post-war views on the war in a 2008 ten-minute television special. As he saw it, the Norwegian [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Labour Party government]] before the war stood &quot;entirely on the side of the [[Soviet Union]].&quot; He pointed to the Soviet Union as the greatest murderer of the war, and considered that nobody had &quot;opened their eyes&quot; to the fact that the Soviet Union was the only country that won territorial gains following the war. While he maintained that the coup headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]] was both bad and illegal, he considered that Quisling should be judged softer in light of the situation at the time. He pointed to the government fleeing the country, and what he considered the &quot;pitiful&quot; reaction of Prime Minister [[Johan Nygaardsvold]]. He also noted that while some of the figures in the [[Quisling regime]] had acted out far too harshly, some others had tried to maintain Norway's interests against the occupiers; the alternative of letting the Germans run the country completely unopposed under [[Josef Terboven]] could in his mind have ended up far worse. Gjems-Onstad said he believed that the treason by Quisling should be compared with the lack of preparations for war by Nygaardsvold and the Labour Party government.&lt;ref name=ego08/&gt; Gjems-Onstad also complained that he for unexplained reasons had been kept away from public arrangements related to the Second World War. He said he had not been invited to a single such event. He was also in possession of a large archive of wartime material from the resistance movement in Trøndelag, but said he had not been approached with interest by any public institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/arkivert/21063/|title=Krigshelt bitter på Trondheim|publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=23 November 2011|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
Gjems-Onstad joined the [[Home Guard (Norway)|Norwegian Home Guard]] after the war. From 1947 to 1959 he held the rank of captain there. He was mobilisation manager as military lawyer colonel at Strike Command Southern Norway (''Luftkommando Sør-Norge''), one of the Air Commands of the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]], from 1970 to 1980. He also completed his education in law, graduating with a [[cand.jur.]] degree in 1948. He worked as a judge in southern [[Buskerud]] from 1948 to 1949, and in 1949 he opened a [[law firm]] in Oslo. From 1957 he had access to work with [[Supreme Court (Norway)|Supreme Court]] cases. He was also a consultant or secretary for ''Norsk Gartnerforening'', ''Bruktbilhandlerforeningen/Autoriserte Bruktbilhandleres handelsforbund'' and for the local branch of the [[Norwegian Bar Association]]. He was a board member of the local Bar Association chapter from 1960 to 1964 and of Max Manus AS, the eponymous company belonging to former resistance member [[Max Manus]], from 1965 to 1969.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Gjems-Onstad had served with Manus in the Norwegian Home Guard after the war, and had met his later wife [[Tikken Manus]] for the first time in 1943 when she worked as a [[military attaché]] in [[Stockholm]]. The three remained lifetime close friends ever since they met during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.budstikka.no/kultur/gjems-onstad-har-mistet-en-ner-venn-1.5710658|work=[[Budstikka]]|title=Gjems-Onstad har mistet en nær venn|first=Sonia Anita|last=Jensen|language=Norwegian|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 Gjems-Onstad left his lawyer's firm to work as a consultant in [[Den norske Creditbank]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He became a central figure in the DnC's plans to develop the [[Vaterland, Norway|Vaterland]] neighbourhood in Oslo.&lt;ref name=m31&gt;Mauseth, 1991, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; AS Vaterland was created soon after the DnC had been granted construction rights in 1965,&lt;ref name=m31/&gt; and was a project designated for planning to develop the Vaterland neighbourhood into a business and office centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=37725&amp;page=44&amp;date=15.4.1969|title=Ordfører Bull med fredsrose på &quot;Et sted å være&quot;|language=Norwegian|date=15 April 1969|accessdate=3 December 2011|page=44|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad was a board member of AS Vaterland from 1966 to 1972, and was its CEO from 1970.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He soon got the nickname the &quot;Vaterland King&quot; (''Vaterlandskongen''), after a local 1930s house owner.&lt;ref name=m31/&gt; After a while, the plans for the development was dropped, as neither the bank nor the municipality saw it to be in their interests to realise the plans.&lt;ref&gt;Mauseth, 1991, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad was removed from his position with a [[golden parachute]] of {{NOK|500,000}} in 1972 and lost his faith in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vaterlanddirektøren som fikk 500 000 kroner for å slutte: – Jeg har ikke lenger tro på Vaterland|last=Worm-Müller|first=Dag|date=25 February 1972|work=[[Verdens Gang|VG]]|page=9|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1972 to 1977 he operated a lawyer's firm in Oslo again, and from 1977 he moved his office to [[Hvalstad]] and worked as a [[defender (law)|defender]] in [[Asker and Bærum District Court]]. He retired as a defender in 1990, but remained a lawyer until 2001.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; During the 1980s he defended several anti-immigration activists, including [[Vivi Krogh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drømmer om en hvit jul|last=Brigg|first=Øyvind|date=23 April 1981|work=[[Verdens Gang|VG]]|page=13|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Ødegård&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sint forsvarer|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=20 June 1985|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arne Myrdal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myrdal-saken for Høyesterett|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=3 November 1989|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that he by 1994 had helped draft the wills of several anonymous persons who wanted to designate their fortunes, ranging from {{NOK|100,000}} to {{NOK|10 million}}, to persons and organisations working against immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=73821&amp;page=1&amp;date=17.9.1994|title=Formuer testamenteres til kamp mot innvandring|language=Norwegian|date=17 September 1994|accessdate=9 December 2011|pages=1–2|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports official==
Gjems-Onstad had an active career in sports. He represented the club [[SK Rye]] which he joined on 1 August 1936, and was made an honorary member of the club in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;rye&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsklubbenrye.no/node/15513|work=[[SK Rye]]|language=Norwegian|title=Æresmedlem i Sk Rye er gått bort|date=24 November 2011|accessdate=18 December 2011|first=Lars Åge|last=Hjelseth}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the Norwegian junior champion in [[cycling]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;snl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Erik_Gjems-Onstad|work=[[Store norske leksikon]]|title=Erik Gjems-Onstad|language=Norwegian|date=22 November 2011|accessdate=29 November 2011|first=Svein|last=Askheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an active [[race walking|race walker]], with two sixth places in the Norwegian championships achieved between 1967 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friidrett.no/stevner/statistikk/NMkappgang/Sider/default.aspx|first=Erling|last=Andersen|authorlink=Erling Andersen|publisher=[[Norwegian Athletics]]|date=5 June 2011|title=Adelskalender NM kappgang|language=Norwegian|accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chaired the [[Norwegian Cycling Federation]] from 1959 to 1965 and the Norwegian Walking Association from 1967 to 1973.

==Politics==

===Member of Parliament===
From 1960 to 1964 Gjems-Onstad was a member of the school board in Oslo, representing the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He was also a member of the libertarian organisation [[Libertas (Norway)|Libertas]], but had left it by 1971 as he considered that it had become &quot;too tame.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mauseth, 1991, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Progress Party (Norway)|Anders Lange's Party]] (ALP) was founded in 1973 he joined the party and became deputy leader under [[Anders Lange]]. He had been present at the founding meeting at ''Saga kino'', and was offered a place in the party's central leadership by Anders Lange after they one day incidentally met outside Gjems-Onstad's lawyer's office. From then on he was the most central person in the party after Lange himself. Besides his leading positions in business and sports, Gjems-Onstad had for years expressed his political views in newspapers and journals, which broadly coincided with Lange's views. By offering him positions in the party, Lange particularly thought that Gjems-Onstad could help develop the party politically and organisationally.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, 1998, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1973|1973 parliamentary election]] he won a seat in the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] from [[Akershus]], and became a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and the Election Committee.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; During his term he set a new record for number of times speaking to the assembly&amp;mdash;325 times in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=– Måle krefter og viljestyrke|last=Hjelmark|first=Mette|date=21 June 1980|work=[[Verdens Gang|VG]]|page=26|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of his parliamentary term he made some proposals that were opposed by the entire parliament, including his own party. He proposed in November 1973 to introduce gun and shooting training as an optional course for students in high school, and to [[Separation of church and state|separate church and state]] (with its financial implications). The proposals were criticised in a press statement by Anders Lange and the party's two other MPs.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, pp. 217–219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=50490&amp;page=2&amp;date=17.11.1973|title=Gjems-Onstad får resten av ALPgruppen mot seg|language=Norwegian|date=17 November 1973|accessdate=3 December 2011|page=2|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turmoil later also erupted in the Akershus and Bærum chapters of the party, and calls were made for expelling Gjems-Onstad due to his proposals in parliament;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=51771&amp;page=3&amp;date=26.6.1974|title=Mitt styre ikke gått av i Akershus ALP|language=Norwegian|date=26 June 1974|accessdate=4 December 2011|page=3|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this wing however left the party in 1975 after being in clear minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=53180&amp;page=1&amp;date=17.2.1975|title=Opprydding i ALP var nødvendig idag|language=Norwegian|date=17 February 1975|accessdate=4 December 2011|page=1|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad and Lange nonetheless stood together in their conflict with [[Carl I. Hagen]] and [[Kristofer Almås]], who sought to strengthen the party's deliberately loose organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, 1998, pp. 52–53, 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; After Lange's death in 1974, Gjems-Onstad became leader of the party's parliamentary group.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; While Hagen and Almås had broken out and formed the [[Reform Party (Norway, 1974)|Reform Party]] earlier the same year, Gjems-Onstad welcomed Hagen back to the party in 1975 for &quot;constructive cooperation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=53713&amp;page=2&amp;date=27.5.1975|title=Gjenforenet ALP i egen kro|language=Norwegian|date=27 May 1975|accessdate=4 December 2011|page=2|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thereafter changed to support the work led by Hagen and [[Arve Lønnum]] of strengthening the party organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, 1998, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gjems-Onstad's cooperation with Hagen was however not to last.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, 1998, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever-ongoing conflicts within the party,&lt;ref name=&quot;aft3&quot;/&gt; and he had by mid-year not decided whether or not he wanted to run for re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ALP går trolig til valg i samtlige fylker i 1977|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=56219&amp;page=3&amp;date=15.6.1976|date=15 June 1976|accessdate=6 December 2011|language=Norwegian|page=3|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and wanted no part in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the party at the start of October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alle gjenvalgt i Stortinget tross flere stemmer|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=57065&amp;page=3&amp;date=2.10.1976|date=2 October 1976|accessdate=6 December 2011|language=Norwegian|page=3|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he in turn recommended voters to rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with ''[[Aftenposten]]'', he was finally expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I.

===Gjems-Onstad and Africa===
Gjems-Onstad travelled extensively in Africa.

He also travelled extensively throughout [[South Africa]], and said that conditions for blacks were better there than in other African countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;aft1&quot;/&gt;  He was introduced to a South African official visiting Norway in 1974 by Anders Lange,&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; and visited the country himself in 1975 after being invited by the South African Department of Information. He met with figures including [[Connie Mulder]], and following Lange's death he considered himself as the continuation of Lange's legacy with regards to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Rygnestad &amp; Kvanmo, 1993, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the South African policy since the 1970s of gradually dismantling the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] system, which included the granting of independence to tribal [[bantustan|homelands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aft2&quot;/&gt; He was in the country in April 1976 for a conference that was to prepare the establishment of [[Transkei]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aft3&quot;/&gt; He later considered the homelands to be true democratic states governed by the rule of law, which he considered that many other African states were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syd-Afrika og apartheidsystem|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=43056&amp;page=26&amp;date=25.1.1983|date=25 January 1983|accessdate=25 November 2011|language=Norwegian|page=26|first=Erik|last=Gjems-Onstad|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad strongly opposed the [[African National Congress]] and the Norwegian government's support of the group, as he believed their agenda would lead to civil war and a government led by [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]]—as had happened in other African countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;aft2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=56955&amp;page=12&amp;date=20.9.1976|title=Norge og Afrika|language=Norwegian|date=20 September 1976|accessdate=24 November 2011|first=Erik|last=Gjems-Onstad|page=12|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later pointed to the development in former Rhodesia, [[Robert Mugabe]]'s [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=70608&amp;page=18&amp;date=30.10.1985|title=Misforståelser om Syd-Afrika|language=Norwegian|date=30 October 1985|accessdate=30 November 2011|first=Erik|last=Gjems-Onstad|page=18|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arranged several study trips to South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=76158&amp;page=26&amp;date=15.7.1989|title=Protest-turer til Sør-Afrika|language=Norwegian|date=15 July 1989|accessdate=18 December 2011|page=26|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of a group of eight Norwegians who toured the country in 1987 and issued an &quot;apology&quot; to the South African government for the Norwegian government's policy towards the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nordmenn i Sør-Afrika|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=72218&amp;page=8&amp;date=4.2.1987|date=4 February 1987|accessdate=30 November 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to [[Rhodesia]] in April 1979 as the sole Norwegian observer of the [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|general election]],&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 1995, pp. 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt; after he had been invited by the Rhodesian Department of Information. He admitted at the same time that he for years had corresponded with the Rhodesian government about how he considered various institutions and individuals in Norway, particularly in the news media. The relationship was initiated after Gjems-Onstad had written a letter of sympathy to Rhodesian Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] some years ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.retriever-info.com/proxy/?id=055016197904192Rqt9t1MkZ7J3Ymhf63VY08O100201010i14&amp;x=fde60be18e8875d6ee99c0dc55662f0f|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|title=Erik Gjems-Onstad innrømmer: &quot;E-Agent for Rhodesia&quot;|first=Sveinung|last=Lunde|date=19 April 1979|accessdate=24 November 2011|language=Norwegian|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Erik Gjems-Onstad til Rhodesia|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=62916&amp;page=6&amp;date=22.3.1979|date=22 March 1979|accessdate=8 December 2011|language=Norwegian|page=6|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in [[Harare|Salisbury]], he met with Smith, Foreign Minister [[P.

===Later political activity===
Carl I. Hagen wrote in his book ''Ærlighet varer lengst'' in 1984 that he would put his office on the line in order to prevent Gjems-Onstad from making a &quot;comeback&quot; to the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] (ALP's successor), despite his alleged requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=&quot;Bare tull&quot; at Høyre prøvde å verve Hagen|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=35689&amp;page=5&amp;date=2.11.1984|work=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian|date=2 November 1984|first=Ole Johan|last=Nilsen|accessdate=8 December 2011|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad criticised Hagen strongly for his complicity in the establishment of a [[Brundtland's Second Cabinet|Labour Party government]] in 1986, and was a member of the Conservative Party by 1988. He supported prospects of a Conservative Party government led by [[Jan P. Syse]], but criticised the Norwegian political system for being a &quot;caricature&quot; of democracy, instead considering it a [[particracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aften&quot;/&gt; Gjems-Onstad had according to his own statement in 1987 not seen any reason for getting himself involved in the public debate about immigration until then. The reaction followed a comment by [[Students' League of the Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party student politician]] Knut Albert Solem, in which he &quot;presupposed&quot; that anti-immigration sentiment was based on feelings of &quot;foreign-hate&quot;, something which Gjems-Onstad disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Det dreier seg ikke om fremmedhat|first=Erik|last=Gjems-Onstad|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=74055&amp;page=12&amp;date=10.11.1987|work=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian|date=10 November 1987|accessdate=16 December 2011|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gjems-Onstad contested the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1989|1989 parliamentary election]] for the [[Stop Immigration]] party in [[Akershus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Partiet Stopp Innvandringen vil inn på Stortinget: Kjentfolk stiller ved 89-valget|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=75221&amp;page=8&amp;date=24.9.1988|work=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian|first=Kurt-Johnny|last=Olsen|date=24 September 1988|accessdate=9 December 2011|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chaired its regional chapter from 1988 to 1990.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He was expelled from the party together with [[Hege Søfteland]] and [[Torfinn Hellandsvik]]&lt;ref name=&quot;db&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Dagbladet]]|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/tekstarkiv/artikkel.php?id=5001970051613|title=Fortsatt FRP-kontakt med rasister|first=Ann-Magritt|last=Austenå|author2=Eriksen, Thor Gjermund |authorlink2=Thor Gjermund Eriksen |date=5 September 1997|accessdate=4 October 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to their vocal criticism of the leadership of the party's leader [[Jack Erik Kjuus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parti-topper i åpen strid|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=36557&amp;page=7&amp;date=16.9.1989|work=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian|date=16 September 1989|accessdate=27 December 2011|page=7|first=Anne-Sissel|last=Skånvik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fortsatt formann|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=37537&amp;page=7&amp;date=16.11.1989|work=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian|date=16 November 1989|accessdate=27 December 2011|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 Gjems-Onstad ran unsuccessfully in the [[Norwegian local elections, 1991|local election]] for the [[Fatherland Party (Norway)|Fatherland Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Innvandringsmotstandere inn i Drammen og Karmøy|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=10 September 1991|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was later active in ''[[Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring]]''.&lt;ref name=will&gt;{{cite news|title=Drapsdømt nynazist får millionarven|last=Rognmo|first=Gro|date=29 August 2009|work=Dagbladet|page=12|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also present at the [[1995 Godlia kino meeting scandal|meeting at Godlia kino in 1995]].&lt;ref name=&quot;db&quot;/&gt; Gjems-Onstad expressed his outrage at the [[Lund Report]] in 1996 after it was revealed that he had been under surveillance by the [[Norwegian Police Security Service]] (POT), considering it defamatory and demanding an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.retriever-info.com/proxy/?id=055016199605294CT87r3VFhTb3XyDkd1EnxfG10020101091p&amp;x=eb8b76921137bd4a559dc6197cbb2c7e|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|title=Krigshelt raser|date=29 May 1996|accessdate=27 November 2011|language=Norwegian|first=Erik H.|last=Sønstelie|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mappe-interesserte må smøre seg med tålmodighet|date=9 July 1996|language=Norwegian|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her will, millionaire Clara Westin declared that {{NOK|2.5 million}} be given to anti-immigration activists, and that the distribution be decided by a board consisting of four people.&lt;ref name=will/&gt; Egil Karlsen backed out and gave up his vote to Gjems-Onstad, and the other three were Gjems-Onstad, Norvald Aasen of ''Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring'' and Bjarne Pettersen. It surfaced that suggestions by board members included the mother of [[murder of Benjamin Hermansen|child murder convict]] [[Ole Nicolai Kvisler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tv2a&quot;/&gt; While the background for involving Kvisler was his anti-immigration views, the pressing issue was the matter of his court ruling. Having followed the case closely as a former lawyer, Gjems-Onstad had disputed the court ruling as he believed there was not evidence to conclude that Kvisler had any more than possibly a subsidiary role in the murder; he thus explained the suggestion with providing funds for reopening his case. Gjems-Onstad maintained that it was only the other convict, [[Joe Erling Jahr]], who had committed the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/-hva-slags-forraedere-er-dette-1979417.html|work=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]]|language=Norwegian|title=- Hva slags forrædere er dette?|first=Asle|last=Bentzen|date=12 June 2008|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/Strid-om-Krigskorset-psttt-rasisme-og-ytringsfrihet-2562291.html|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|language=Norwegian|title=Strid om Krigskorset, påstått rasisme og ytringsfrihet|date=21 October 2008|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pettersen had in addition wanted to distribute money to people from his circle around [[Vigrid (Norway)|Vigrid]] (a group Gjems-Onstad loathed),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Dagsavisen]]|title=Støtter Benjamins drapsmann med besøk|first=Nina|last=Johnsrud|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=10 December 2011|language=Norwegian|url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/article354027.ece?sec=meninger&amp;pageNum=7}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Tore Tvedt]] and [[Øyvind Heian]], but was squeezed out of the board after this was opposed by Gjems-Onstad and Aasen.&lt;ref name=&quot;tv2a&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/naa-utbetales-arvepengene-til-hoeyreekstreme-3161059.html|work=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]]|title=Nå utbetales arvepengene til høyreekstreme|first1=Asbjørn|last1=Olsen|first2=Espen|last2=Eide|language=Norwegian|date=15 March 2010|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The left-wing anti-racist organization [[SOS Rasisme]] petitioned the Norwegian state to confiscate Gjems-Onstad's war decorations, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gjems-Onstad beholder medaljer|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=31 January 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all disputes were resolved, it was not made public who actually received any money.&lt;ref name=&quot;tv2a&quot;/&gt;

==Writings==
Gjems-Onstad has authored several books.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He wrote about the psychological warfare of the Norwegian resistance movement in ''DURHAM: hemmelige operasjoner i Trøndelag mot tysk okkkupasjonsmakt 1943-45'', released in 1981. [[Durham (Norwegian resistance)|Durham]] was the codeword for the operations which to a large extent consisted of distributing flyers, brochures and posters with the purpose of demoralising the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Papirkrig mot nazismen|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=37494&amp;page=3&amp;date=23.5.1981|date=23 May 1981|accessdate=8 December 2011|language=Norwegian|page=3|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the topic in ''Psykologisk krigføring i Norge under Annen Verdenskrig 1940-45'', published in 1994.

The reasons given for awarding the [[War Cross (Norway)|War Cross]] (Norway's highest decoration) was in the book also made public for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heltegjerninger nøkternt fortalt|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=74411&amp;page=49&amp;date=6.4.1995|work=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian|date=6 April 1995|first=Erle Moestue|last=Bugge|accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
