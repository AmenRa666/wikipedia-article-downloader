Despite her lower rank by birth,{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=284}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|p=7}} he was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person.{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=285}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|p=15}}

In June 1828, [[Irish and German Mercenary Soldiers' Revolt|Irish and German mercenaries mutinied]] in Rio de Janeiro.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=207–210}}{{sfn|Costa|1995|pp=121–128}} Discontented with the harsh conditions of military life in Brazil, the foreigners readily accepted bribes from the United Provinces to not only rebel, but to also capture the Emperor so that he could be held hostage as a bargaining chip.{{sfn|Costa|1995|pp=126–138}}{{sfn|Calmon|1950|p=173}} The mercenary mutiny was put down with much bloodshed.

In the months following 7 September, João&amp;nbsp;VI was still recognized as the rightful ruler of the independent Kingdom of Brazil.{{sfn|Viana|1966|pp=13–14}} Brazil's independence movement was not directed against the King, who was regarded as merely a figurehead dominated by the ''Cortes''.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=95}} The prince regent was only later persuaded to accept the Brazilian crown as emperor, not king. Pedro, however, made it clear that, if his father returned to Brazil, he would relinquish the throne.{{sfn|Lima|1997|p=404}}

It was promulgated and solemnly sworn on 25 March 1824.&lt;ref&gt;See:

&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation came to a head when Pedro&amp;nbsp;I, on the grounds of inappropriate conduct, dismissed Bonifácio and his brother [[Martim Francisco de Andrada]] from their ministry portfolios.

Although the Emperor had once regarded him as a mentor, Pedro&amp;nbsp;I began to chafe in the subservient position of neophyte to Bonifácio's role as schoolmaster.

Property owners were protected from having their lands confiscated, and no citizen could thenceforth be arrested without a written warrant, unless caught in the process of committing a crime. Suspects could no longer be held for more than 48 hours without being charged and were entitled to representation. Torture, secret trials, and inhumane restraints were also abolished.{{harv|Macaulay|1986|p=96}}{{harv|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=231–232}}
Pedro&amp;nbsp;I had envisioned this union since 1822 and had attempted to convince Miguel to return to Brazil. The Emperor wrote to him then: &quot;There will be no shortage of people who tell you not to leave ... Tell them to eat shit. And they'll say that with Brazil seceding you're going to be King of Portugal: tell them to do it again&quot;{{harv|Macaulay|1986|p=118}}

== Improvements ==

When I wrote this article years ago, I did not have the experience in writing I have today. I made some much needed improvements in it, mainly sticking to a &quot;three paragraph per section&quot; rule. Superfluous information, that did not add to context, but was nonetheless useful to expand our opinion of Pedro I's character, was turned into footnotes. His second marriage, and his relationship with Amélie are now in a single section. --[[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 17:34, 4 February 2016 (UTC)
:I also trimmed down the sections dealing with the independence. The reason they were so detailed was because we lacked, and still lack, a decent article about the [[Independence of Brazil]]. Hopefully, that won't be a problem one day. --[[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 18:06, 4 February 2016 (UTC)
::I reverted Grenzer's last additions, for the following reasons: Dom Pedro's musical talents, including his apprenticeship with Marcos Portugal is already told in &quot;Marriage section&quot;, including what type of instruments. Also, the additions looked as a random collection of trivia. The article is already heavy, and I shortened many parts to make it straighfoward as possible. I plan to remove some of the footnotes as well, once related articles are improved. Example: when I write Leopoldina's article, I'll move the passage about Pedro's allegedly physical aggression to there. Same with the explanation of what horse he employed, once I'm done with Independence of Brazil. I hope Grenzer's can understand that. I appreciate his help, but the article doesn't need more, but less. What we need is to work on other articles. --[[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 18:37, 5 February 2016 (UTC)</text>
