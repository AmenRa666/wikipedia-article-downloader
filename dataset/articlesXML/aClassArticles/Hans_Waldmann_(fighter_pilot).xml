'''Hans Peter Waldmann''' (24 September 1922 – 18 March 1945) was a German [[Luftwaffe]] (Air Force) [[fighter ace]] and recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}), an honour that recognised extreme bravery on the battlefield or outstanding military leadership in [[Nazi Germany]]. Waldmann received the award after he had shot down 85 enemy aircraft. In total, he was credited with 134 aerial victories accumulated in 527 combat missions.

Born in [[Braunschweig]], Waldmann volunteered for service in the Luftwaffe in 1940. After training at various pilot and fighter-pilot schools, he was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 52]] (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing), operating on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], in August 1942. Here Waldmann fought in the aerial battles over [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], the [[Battle of the Caucasus|Caucasus]], the [[Black Sea]], and the [[Battle of the Crimea (1944)|Crimea]]. He was credited with 84 aerial victories before briefly being transferred to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], where he was credited with one aerial victory. Back on the Eastern Front, Waldmann accumulated further victories, bringing his score to 125 victories by end of May 1944. He then fought in the skies over France after the [[Western Allies|Western Allied]] [[Invasion of Normandy]], claiming seven aerial victories, before converting to the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet fighter in late 1944. Flying the Me 262, Waldmann shot down two [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s on 22 February 1945 before being killed in a [[mid-air collision]] with one of his squadron members on 18 March 1945 near [[Schwarzenbek]], [[Holstein]].

==Childhood, education and early career==
Waldmann was born in [[Braunschweig]] in the [[Free State of Brunswick]] on 24 September 1922. He was the second son of Ludwig Waldmann, a bank manager, and his wife Maria. Waldmann had an older brother Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, pp. 12, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 he attended the ''[[Volksschule]]'', a primary school, in the Comenius-Street.&lt;ref group=&quot;Tr&quot;&gt;Comenius-Street—''Comeniusstraße''&lt;/ref&gt; Over Easter in 1932 he transferred to the humanities-oriented secondary school Wilhelm-[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]].&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jungmann at Old Warden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bücker Bü 131]] &quot;Jungmann&quot;]]
In 1938, Waldmann applied for a career as an officer in the Luftwaffe for the first time. Travelling to Berlin, he was deemed suitable but at the age of 16 was too young to volunteer for military service.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of World War II, while still at school, Waldmann and his fellow students were forced into compulsory labour service (''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]''). Waldmann was assigned to the Brunswick Mechanical Engineering Institute.&lt;ref group=&quot;Tr&quot;&gt;Brunswick Mechanical Engineering Institute—''Braunschweigischen Maschinenbauanstalt''—BMA&lt;/ref&gt; Since Waldmann had intended to study aircraft construction after his military service, he was reassigned to the Institute of Aeronautical Metrology and Flight Meteorology at the [[Braunschweig Airport|Braunschweig-Waggum airfield]] under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Heinrich Koppe.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Tr&quot;&gt;Institute of Aeronautical Metrology and Flight Meteorology—''Institut of Luftfahrtmeßtechnik und Flugmeteorologie''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of March 1940, Waldmann graduated from school with his ''[[Abitur]]'' (diploma).&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; After this he was accepted into the Luftwaffe, two years after his initial application. Commencing in July 1940, he undertook 12 weeks of basic military training with ''Fliegerausbildungsregiment'' 72 (72nd Flight Training Regiment) at [[Fels am Wagram]] in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, Waldmann was transferred to the ''Flugzeugführerschule'' A/B 72 (flight school for the [[pilot license]]) at Markersdorf near [[Sankt Pölten]] in early October 1940.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Flight training in the Luftwaffe progressed through the levels A1, A2 and B1, B2, referred to as A/B flight training. A training included theoretical and practical training in aerobatics, navigation, long-distance flights and dead-stick landings. The B courses included high-altitude flights, instrument flights, night landings and training to handle the aircraft in difficult situations.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later his training group returned to Fels am Wagram because Markersdorf was overcrowded with other flight courses. Thus flight training started on the improvised airfield without hangars at Fels am Wagram. His first familiarisation flight was on 16 October 1940, in a [[Bücker Bü 131]] &quot;Jungmann&quot; biplane marked &quot;VTAF&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Waldmann logged his first solo flight on 13 November 1940 at 09:17 in a Bü 131 &quot;CGNL&quot;, landing again after six minutes of flight time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bracke 1997, p. 31&quot;&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; His training group returned to Markersdorf in February 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bracke 1997, p. 31&quot;/&gt; From here, he conducted his first cross-country flights on the Bü 131 &quot;Jungmann&quot; as well as the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 44]] &quot;Stieglitz&quot;. The majority of the cross-country flights were flown on the [[Gotha Go 145]]. From 4 April to 28 April 1941 he made the round trip from Markersdorf to [[Pocking]], [[Nürnberg]], [[Ettinghausen, Germany|Ettingshausen]], [[Ingolstadt]], [[Zwickau]], [[Hildesheim]], Braunschweig, [[Mannheim]], [[Karlsruhe]], [[Delmenhorst]], [[Halberstadt]] and [[Fürth]]. At Ettingshausen he received instruction in [[formation flying]] and [[aerobatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union, had been underway for two months, and after completing his A/B flight training at Markersdorf Waldmann was transferred to the [[Jagdfliegerschule#Jagdfliegerschule 6|''Jagdfliegerschule'' 6]] (6th Fighter Pilot School) at Lachen-Speyerdorf near [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße]].&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the final phase of his fighter pilot training in [[Gleiwitz]], [[Upper Silesia]], from 3 June to 17 August 1942, before transferring to the front.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:JG52-Emblem.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jagdgeschwader 52 Emblem]]
Holding the rank of ''[[unteroffizier]]'', a [[non-commissioned officer]] similar in rank to [[sergeant]], on 20 August 1942 Waldmann was tasked with shuttling new [[Messerschmitt Bf-109]]Gs from a factory at [[Kraków|Krakau]] to units on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Along with six other newly trained pilots, he reached [[Lemberg]] where the group was scheduled for a stop over. Bad weather closed in and Waldmann was the only one to take off before the group was grounded. Getting away at 17:55, he headed for [[Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine|Proskuriv]]. The next day he continued his journey to [[Uman]], {{Convert|230|km|mi}} south of [[Kiev]] in Ukraine. For the next few days, he was sent back and forth until he finally reached the II. [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Gruppe|''Gruppe'']] (2nd group) of [[Jagdgeschwader 52]] (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing) at Tusow, operating in the combat area of [[Stalingrad]].&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)|Organisation of the Luftwaffe during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On arrival, Waldmann was approached by ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (Captain) [[Johannes Steinhoff]] and asked whether he would like to fly as his wingman. Waldmann then conducted six familiarisation flights on the &quot;Gustav&quot;, as the [[Bf-109G]]-2 was referred to, on 30 August 1942. Flying a Bf-109 marked with a black &quot;[[Chevron (insignia)|Chevron]]-2&quot;, indicating an aircraft of the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Stab]]'', he flew his first combat mission on 31 August 1942 in the vicinity of Stalingrad. Steinhoff was impressed by his first performance. At the time, Waldmann was still officially assigned to a transfer squadron, but Steinhoff decided to keep him in his ''Stabs''-''[[Schwarm]]'', flight of four.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Here his comrades nicknamed Waldmann &quot;''Dackel''&quot;, an [[allusion]] to his last name. In German, a &quot;''Dackel''&quot;, or [[Dachshund]], is often named Waldi, a [[hypocoristic]] form of Waldmann.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War against the Soviet Union===
On 9 September 1942 Waldmann scored his first aerial victory, and thereafter scored rapidly.  After 84 victories on 1 September 1943, Waldmann was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (second lieutenant) and assigned to [[Ergänzungs-Jagdgruppe Ost]] (Supplementary Fighter Group East). Here he was credited with the destruction of a [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] on 5 January 1944. This victory, his 85th, was actually a separation-shot—a severely damaged [[heavy bomber]] forced to separate from his [[combat box]]—which counted as an aerial victory.&lt;ref group=&quot;Tr&quot;&gt;Separation-shot—''Herausschuss''&lt;/ref&gt; Waldmann had attacked a 28-aircraft bomber formation and severely damaged the B-17. The aerial-victory commission of [[Luftflotte 3]] also credited the Flak-Regiment 45 of 12. Flak-Brigade with this victory. Following this aerial victory, he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 5 February 1944. The presentation of the award was announced by the Greater German Radio—the official radio station of the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]]—on the evening of 20 February 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Tr&quot;&gt;Greater German Radio—''Großdeutsche Rundfunk''&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February 1944 Waldmann was sent back to the [[Crimean peninsula]] on the Eastern Front, where he took command of 4./JG 52 (4th Squadron of the 52nd Fighter Wing) as its ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader).&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his success, claiming eight aerial victories in March, and 16 in April of which eight were claimed from 5–12 April. On 11 April 1944 he claimed two [[Yakovlev Yak-7]]s as his 99th and 100th opponents shot down. He was the 70th ''Luftwaffe'' pilot to achieve the century mark.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier 1989, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; By 31 May 1944 his score stood at 125 aerial victories.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, pp. 128, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Two ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffeln]]'' (squadrons) of the II./JG 52 were transferred to [[Huși]] at the [[Prut River]] on 27 May 1944. Here Waldmann claimed his final four victories on the Eastern Front before ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' [[Gerhard Barkhorn]] was ordered to transfer one ''Staffel'' to the west in [[Defence of the Reich]]. Barkhorn selected Waldmann's 4th ''Staffel'' which was officially assigned to the II./[[Jagdgeschwader 3]] &quot;Udet&quot; (JG 3—3rd Fighter Wing), at the time under the command of ''Hauptmann'' [[Hans-Ekkehard Bob]].&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, pp. 141–142, 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion of Normandy===
The [[Invasion of Normandy]], which started on the early morning of 6 June 1944, was in full swing by the time Waldmann's ''Staffel'' arrived in France. The [[Western Allies]] were already breaking out of Normandy in what was codenamed [[Operation Cobra]]. II./JG 3 &quot;Udet&quot; (2nd Group of the 3rd Fighter Wing) was stationed at [[Nogent-le-Roi]], roughly {{Convert|50|km|mi}} southwest of Paris. The Gruppe was tasked with [[ground support]] missions. In one of these missions against the Allied invasion forces, Waldmann claimed to have damaged a [[P-51 Mustang]] on 31 July 1944. He was credited with the destruction of numerous trucks during ground support missions over the period of 2–5 August 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldmann's claimed his first aerial victory in the west, his 126th in total, over a [[B-24 Liberator]] on 6 August 1944. Waldmann had taken off at 11:43 on a [[Combat air patrol|free-fighter sweep]] mission against heavy bombers. His unit spotted a formation of B-24s after 45 minutes flying time. Waldmann attacked and with his first pass at an altitude of {{Convert|5000|m|ft}} had hit one of the B-24 between the two starboard engines, which immediately set the bomber on fire. The B-24 was observed to crash {{Convert|3|km|mi}} southeast of Méry.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; His final tally for August was seven Allied planes, including the B-24, one [[Auster]] on 7 August, and five [[P-47 Thunderbolts]] (two on 14 August, two on 18 August and one on 19 August).&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, pp. 224–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 and death===
Waldmann learned to fly the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] &quot;Stormbird&quot;, the first operational jet fighter, at [[Landsberg am Lech]] and [[Kaltenkirchen]] in December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; He was then transferred to 3./[[Jagdgeschwader 7]] (JG 7—7th Fighter Wing), now flying the &quot;Stormbird&quot;, as its ''[[Staffelkapitän|Staffelführer]]'' (squadron leader on probation).&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-2497, Flugzeug Me 262A auf Flugplatz.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Me 262 A, circa 1944]]
Together with his wingman‚ ''Oberfähnrich'' Günter Schrey, Waldmann took off at 11:39 on 22 February 1945 from [[Oranienburg]] on an [[offensive counter air|offensive counter-air]] mission against inbound Allied heavy bombers.&lt;ref group=&quot;Tr&quot;&gt;Offensive counter air—''Freie Jagd''&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-American attack was codenamed [[Operation Clarion]]. About 20 minutes into the flight, roughly {{Convert|30|km|mi}} west of Berlin, they spotted an American P-51 Mustang flying at {{Convert|7000|m|ft}}. Closing fast, Waldmann shot down the Mustang at 12:02 before proceeding west for [[Magdeburg]]. Near [[Oschersleben]] they spotted another Mustang at {{Convert|3800|m|ft}}. Waldmann shot it down at 12:17, achieving his 134th and final aerial victory. The Mustang was observed crashing into a forest {{Convert|25|km|mi}} northeast of the [[Brocken]], the highest peak of the [[Harz]] mountain range.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Weal 1998, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth 2008, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, 18 March 1945, the lower cloud ceiling at Kaltenkirchen was less than {{Convert|600|m|ft}} and most of the time between {{Convert|80|-|100|m|ft}}, while the upper cloud ceiling was at {{Convert|6000|m|ft}}, rendering flight conditions outside the official operational specification for the Me 262. The jet was not fully cleared for [[instrument flight]], mandating a lower cloud ceiling of more than {{Convert|800|m|ft}}. ''Major'' [[Erich Rudorffer]], ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of the I./JG 7, was attending a meeting at the ''Luftgaukommando'' in [[Hamburg]]-[[Blankensee]], when ''Oberleutnant'' [[Hans Grünberg]], the most senior officer on duty and ''Staffelkapitän'' of the 1st ''Staffel'', received the order from ''Major'' Richter, the Ia (operations officer), to engage inbound heavy bombers. Grünberg initially argued that weather conditions prohibited a safe takeoff but ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann Göring]] intervened and ordered the jets to engage the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bracke 1997, p. 189&quot;&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boehme 1992, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The order resulted in the death of both Waldmann and his wingman Schrey on the following mission. Waldmann was killed following a mid-air collision with ''Leutnant'' [[Hans-Dieter Weihs]] shortly after takeoff, and Schrey was killed in combat with US fighters. Mindful of the direct order of the ''Reichsmarschall'', ''Oberleutnant'' Grünberg (1st ''Staffel''), ''Oberleutnant'' Fritz Stehle (2nd ''Staffel'') and Waldmann (3rd ''Staffel'') had decided that each of them would lead a flight of four Me 262s, taking off and flying around for an hour before returning without trying to engage the enemy. Grünberg's ''Schwarm'' took off first followed by Stehle's ''Schwarm''.&lt;ref&gt;Boehme 1992, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Waldmann chose Weihs, as the most experienced pilot trained in instrument flight, to lead the ''Schwarm'', while Schrey once again served as Waldmann's wingman. Waldmann's Me 262 A-1 &quot;Yellow 3&quot; (''Werknummer'' 117097—factory number) took off at 12:24 and Weihs ordered the ''Schwarm'' to form a close formation, flying wing tip to wing tip.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three Me 262s took off; ''Flieger'' Gerhard Reiher's Me 262 had experienced engine failure. Four minutes into the flight, having travelled roughly {{Convert|50|km|mi}} and flying at less than {{Convert|800|m|ft}} above the ground, Weihs' aircraft experienced a heavy blow from below after Waldmann collided with him. His jet in an unrecoverable spin, Weihs bailed out and came down near the Hamburg-Berlin railroad tracks. The airfield at Kaltenkirchen was immediately informed. Waldmann and Schrey were initially believed missing. Waldmann's body was recovered the next day near [[Schwarzenbek]], roughly {{Convert|1|km|mi}} away from the crash site of his Me 262. Apparently he had managed to bail out but failed to deploy his parachute in time, although the injuries sustained during the crash with Weihs' aircraft may have already been fatal as the recovery party found Waldmann with his upper forehead smashed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bracke 1997, p. 189&quot;/&gt; Schrey was also found dead. He had bailed out with his parachute, but his body was found riddled by machine-gun bullets.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fallen airmen were buried with full [[Military funeral|military honours]], including a Me 262 [[flypast]], at the cemetery in Kaltenkirchen. Waldmann's successor as ''Staffelkapitän'', ''Oberleutnant'' Walter Wagner, accompanied Waldmann's mother from Braunschweig to Kaltenkirchen for the funeral. A number of wreaths were laid on his grave, the largest sent by the ''Reichsmarschall''.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Waldmann was recommended for the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross, but the recommendation was either not approved or not finalized before the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Weal 1998, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerial victory credits==
Hans Waldmann was credited with 134 aerial victories, claimed in 527 combat missions, 10 on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] and 124 on the Eastern Front. His tally on the Eastern Front includes five bombers, 86 fighters and 33 [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2 Sturmovik]] ground-attack aircraft. On the Western Front he claimed seven fighters, two four-engined bombers and one observation aircraft. He also flew a number of [[Close air support|ground attack]] missions, destroying 33 various vehicles and eight heavy transports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier p220&quot;&gt;Obermaier 1989, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bracke 1997, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;
