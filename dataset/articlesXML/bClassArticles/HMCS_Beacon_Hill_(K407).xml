'''HMCS ''Beacon Hill''''' was a {{sclass2-|River|frigate}} that served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) as an ocean convoy escort during the [[Second World War]]. She fought primarily in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. In 1954 she was converted to a {{sclass-|Prestonian|frigate|2}} and served until 1957. She was named for [[Victoria, British Columbia]], but as {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}} was in service with the [[Royal Navy]], the RCN, in an effort to avoid confusion, chose to honour the city by choosing another name associated with it.&lt;ref name=Macpherson&gt;{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910-1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages= |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beacon Hill'' was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942-43 River-class building programme. She was laid down 16 July 1943 by [[Yarrows Limited|Yarrows Ltd.]] at [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]] and launched 6 November later that year.&lt;ref name=uboat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/184.html|work=uboat.net |title=HMCS Beacon Hill (K 407) |accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beacon Hill'' was commissioned 16 May 1944 at Esquimalt.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt;

==Background==
{{main article|River-class frigate}}

The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a &quot;twin-screw corvette&quot;, its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}}. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the [[United Kingdom]], giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.friends-amis.org/index.php/en/document-repository/english/fact-sheets/44-canadian-river-class-frigate-1/file |title=Fact Sheet No. 21 - Canadian River Class Frigates |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;frigate&quot; was suggested by Vice-Admiral [[Percy Nelles]] of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2&gt;{{cite book|title=Frigates of the Royal Canadian Navy 1943-1974 |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |publisher=Vanwell Publishing |year=1989 |place=Lewiston, New York |pages=6–7, 15 |isbn=0920277225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at {{convert|7200|nmi|km|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|km/h|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat [[U-boats]] including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt; 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of the {{HMCS|Valleyfield|K329|6}}, they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; The design was too big for the shipyards on the [[Great Lakes]] so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the [[St. Lawrence River]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

==Service history==
After working up in [[Bermuda]], ''Beacon Hill'' was assigned to [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] (MOEF) EG 26, a Canadian support group that would assist any convoy under attack. During her time with EG 26, she was sporadically detached to [[Plymouth]] and [[Portsmouth]] commands.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; EG 26 is among the escort groups deployed to counter snorkel-equipped U-boats in British coastal waters beginning in mid-December 1944. Deploying from [[Derry]], the groups operated in overlapping patrols in the Shetland-Faroes narrows, off Hebrides, in the Irish Sea west of Ireland and in St. George's Channel.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, pp. 378-9&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1945, EG 26 deployed from [[Portsmouth]]. From at least 14 March to 20 April, ''Beacon Hill'' was the Senior Officer's ship of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; She remained in European waters until May 1945, when she departed for Canada. Intended to be used in the ongoing Pacific campaign, ''Beacon Hill'' began her tropicalization refit at [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia]] in June. The refit ended in November 1945, and she sailed for Esquimalt. ''Beacon Hill'' was [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] at Esquimalt on 6 February 1946 and placed in reserve.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

===Post-war service===
''Beacon Hill'' was recommissioned in March 1950 as a training ship for cadets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Spring Training Cruises Near Completion |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=King's Printer |location=Ottawa |date=April 1950 |volume=2 |number=6 |pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1952, ''Beacon Hill'' and {{HMCS|Antigonish|K661|2}} deployed on a training cruise to South America along the Pacific coast, making several port visits. In May, {{HMCS|Sioux|R64|2}}, ''Antigonish'' and ''Beacon Hill'' travelled to [[Juneau, Alaska]] and in August, to [[San Diego]] on training cruises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=R.C.N. News Review |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |location=Ottawa |date=January 1953 |volume=5 |number=3|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was paid off again in 1954 in preparation for her conversion to a ''Prestonian''-class frigate. ''Beacon Hill'' was recommissioned into the RCN with the pennant number FFE 303 on 21 December 1957.&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt; During service with the [[Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron]] she was fitted with a midship deckhouse to provide classroom and training facilities for officer candidates.&lt;ref name=Jan2&gt;{{cite book|title=Jane's Fighting Ships, 1963-1964 |editor=R.v.b. Blackman |year=1963 |publisher=Jane's fighting ships |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beacon Hill'' was a member of the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron based out of [[CFB Esquimalt|Esquimalt, British Columbia]]. In June 1960 the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron performed a training tour of the Pacific, with stops at [[Yokohama]], Japan, [[Midway Atoll]] and [[Pearl Harbor]]. They returned to Canada in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Frigates Take Cadets to Japan |magazine=The Crowsnest |date=July 1960 |volume=12 |number=9 |publisher=Queen's Printer |location=Ottawa |pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January to March 1961, {{HMCS|Sussexvale|K683|2}}, {{HMCS|New Glasgow|K320|2}} and ''Beacon Hill'' performed a training cruise to the South Pacific, visiting [[Hawaii]], [[Fiji]], New Zealand, Australia and [[Samoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Frigates to Make South Seas Cruise |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |location=Ottawa |volume=13 |number=2 |date=December 1960 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She served until 15 September 1967 when she was paid off for the final time. She was sold for scrap and broken up at [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]], [[Japan]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

==Ship's bell==
The Christening Bells Project at [[Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt]] Naval and Military Museum includes information from the [[ship's bell]] of HMCS Beacon Hill 1944 - 1967, which was used for [[baptism]] of babies onboard ship 1950 - 1964. The bell is currently held by the CFB Esquimalt Naval &amp; Military Museum, Esquimalt, BC.&lt;ref name=bells&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navalandmilitarymuseum.org/resource_pages/bells/bells.asp |work=CFB Esquimalt Naval and Military Museum |title=Christening Bells |accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
