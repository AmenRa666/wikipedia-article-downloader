[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] '''James Philo Hagerstrom''' (January 14, 1921 – June 25, 1994) was a [[fighter pilot]] and [[flying ace]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in [[World War II]] and the [[United States Air Force]] in the [[Korean War]]. With a career total of 14.5 victories, he is one of seven American pilots to achieve ace status in two different wars.

Born in [[Cedar Falls, Iowa]], Hagerstrom gained an interest in flying at a young age. He left college in 1941 and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces, being posted to New Guinea to fight in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II]]. There, Hagerstrom mainly [[escort fighter|escorted]] bombers with his [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]], shooting down six Japanese aircraft over the course of the war, including four in one morning. After the war, he flew with the [[Texas Air National Guard]]. By 1950 he was in command of a fighter squadron that was mobilized to Korea following the outbreak of the Korean War. He later transferred to the United States Air Force and flew in [[MiG Alley]] in a [[North American F-86 Sabre]], scoring 8.5 victories over [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]]s.

Returning to the U.S. in 1953, Hagerstrom remained in the Air Force until his retirement in 1968, during which he earned a [[Master of Economics|master's degree in Economics]] and a law degree. In 1965 he was assigned to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] but did not fly combat missions. After retiring, Hagerstrom traveled the Pacific in a homemade boat with his family, living in various Pacific islands before settling in [[Mansfield, Louisiana]]. Hagerstrom died in nearby [[Shreveport]] of [[stomach cancer]] in 1994.

==Early life and education==
Hagerstrom was born on January 14, 1921, in [[Cedar Falls, Iowa]].{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|p=69}}&lt;ref name=&quot;DeathIndex&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=James P Hagerstrom|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JLGF-TMK|website=[[Social Security Death Index]]|publisher=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third son of Edward, an electrician, and Hazel Hagerstrom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite census|title=1940 United States Census|year=1940|location=[[Waterloo, Iowa]]|roll=T627_1139|page=61A|line=27|enumdist=7-26|url=http://1940census.archives.gov/search/?search.state=IA&amp;search.enumeration_district=7-26#filename=m-t0627-01139-01340.tif&amp;name=7-26&amp;type=image&amp;state=IA&amp;index=61&amp;pages=124&amp;bm_all_text=Bookmark|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=1}} He grew up in a small house in [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. His interest in aviation began when he sat in the cockpit of a [[Curtiss JN-4]] [[biplane]] at the age of 5. He &quot;had the thrill of his life&quot; when at thirteen he had a short flight in a [[Ford Trimotor]] aircraft.{{sfn|Sherwood|1998|p=34}}{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|p=69}}

Hagerstrom built [[model airplane]]s as a hobby. For &quot;adrenaline release&quot;, he joined the swimming and wrestling teams at [[Waterloo West High School]].  After graduating in January&amp;nbsp;1939, he began studying at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1941, where he participated in the [[Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps]]. After a year there, he transferred to the [[University of Northern Iowa]] (then known as Iowa State Teachers College), where he helped start an [[aero club]].{{sfn|Sherwood|1998|p=34}}{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|p=69}}

==Military career==

===World War II===
In December&amp;nbsp;1941, just before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he went to [[Iowa City]], where he enlisted in the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] (USAAF) [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|Flying Cadet program]] with a recruiter. On January 17 of the following year, he was sent to [[Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School|Fort Des Moines]] and soon inducted into the USAAF. Not long after, he and other new inductees went to [[Minter Field]] in [[Bakersfield, California]] for more physical examinations, and then they went north to [[Visalia]] for primary training in January&amp;nbsp;23. The class (which had to wear coveralls due to the lack of standard uniforms) first trained in [[Ryan PT-22 Recruit]]s before moving back to Minter Field for basic flight training in [[BT-13 Valiant]]s. Along with his brother Robert, who had also enlisted, Hagerstrom spent about six weeks in basic training. Hagerstrom and his classmates then went to [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke Field]] near [[Phoenix, Arizona]] for advanced flight training in the [[North American T-6 Texan|North American AT-6]]. On July 26, 1942, he was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] and received his [[Aircrew Badge|wings]] from Brigadier General [[Ennis Whitehead]].{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|p=69}}

| source = — James P. Hagerstrom{{sfn|Sherwood|1998|p=34}} }}
Hagerstrom was then sent to [[Myrtle Beach Air Force Base]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]] and Pinnnelas City Air Base in Florida, flying the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]] and [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] with the [[20th Pursuit Group]]. In late September he was posted to the [[8th Fighter Squadron]] (8th FS) of the [[49th Operations Group]] and sent to [[San Francisco, California]]. After staying at the [[Mark Hopkins Hotel]], he and forty other personnel moved on to [[Fort Mason]], where they boarded the Norweigian ship M/V ''Torrens'' along with 1,500 other officers and enlisted men comprising Headquarters, 5th Air Force to Hawaii. They did not stay long, however, and set sail again, this time flanked by a [[Task force#United States Navy|naval task force]]. After an overnight stop at [[Suva]], Fiji, they landed at their destination of [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]], Australia. Initially there was no one there and nothing to do until [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Paul Wurtsmith]], the commander of Fifth Fighter Command, organized a refresher session for the new pilots at [[Charters Towers Airport]]. In April&amp;nbsp;1943, he and the P-40-equipped 8th FS relocated to [[Girua Airport|Dobodura Airfield Complex]] in New Guinea. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]].{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|pp=69–70}}

| quote = I fired my first burst when his wings filled my sight. It hit him in the left engine, wing root and fuselage.

I rolled over and split-essed, only to find he had hit the water.
| source = — James P. Hagerstrom{{sfn|Hess|2004|p=66}} }}
Hagerstrom first saw combat on April&amp;nbsp;11, when he engaged in aerial combat over [[Oro Bay]] with several Japanese [[Zero (aircraft)|Zero]]s, destroying one of them. The 8th FS mainly escorted [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s dropping supplies to ground troops in the jungle. In late 1943, the 49th Operations Group was moved to [[Tsili Tsili Airfield]], recently captured from the Japanese and frequently bombed by them. The 8th FS then switched to escorting [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] and [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] attacks but saw little action. They saw more combat protecting the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers. On October&amp;nbsp;11, Hagerstrom led one of two groups of four aircraft to intercept an approaching [[Mitsubishi Ki-46]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]] over [[Finschhafen]]. He chased the plane for twelve minutes, flying at {{convert|270|mph}} before getting within firing range. He shot down the aircraft by causing its left engine to explode, and the plane crashed.{{sfn|Hess|2004|p=66}} After his navigational instruments malfunctioned, he was forced to fly over the Japanese-occupied town of [[Lae]]; fortunately he caught them by surprise and was not shot at. With no fuel to spare, he safely landed at Tsili Tsili Airfield, which was in [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]] due to an overhead enemy reconnaissance aircraft. Later that month, heavy rainfall made the airstrip too muddy to allow the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]]s to take off, and the P-40 squadrons, including the 8th FS, were relocated {{convert|50|mi}} north to [[Gusap Airfield]].{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|pp=71–72}} Soon after, Hagerstrom contracted [[malaria]] and went to Australia to recover for three weeks, after which he returned to his normal duties.{{sfn|Sherwood|1998|p=34}}{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|pp=71–72}}

On January 23, 1944, Hagerstrom was leading one of four flights of four aircraft in an attempt to assist two P-38 Lightnings escorting bombers near [[Wewak]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=1}}{{sfn|Hammel|2010|p=290}} They encountered 10–15 enemy aircraft, and he shot down three Zeros (more likely [[Nakajima Ki-43]]s) and one [[Kawasaki Ki-61]] &quot;Tony&quot;, making him an [[flying ace|ace]].{{sfn|Hammel|2010|p=290}}{{sfn|Hess|2004|pp=88–89}} He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his &quot;extraordinary heroism&quot; during the engagement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Military Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Valor awards for James P. Hagerstrom|url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=31215|work=Hall of Valor|publisher=Military Times|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, he flew 170 combat missions and destroyed six enemy aircraft.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=1}}

| source = — James P. Hagerstrom{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=1}} }}

===Post-war===
Hagerstrom returned to the U.S. and in June&amp;nbsp;1945  was discharged from the USAAF. He wanted to complete his studies and soon after he was personally and immediately enrolled at the Iowa State Teachers College by the school's president at Hagerstrom's request to return to school. Hagerstrom graduated in 1948 with a degree in economics and subsequently went to [[Houston, Texas]] and entered the [[municipal bond]]s business.{{sfn|Sherwood|1998|pp=34–35}} He also joined the [[111th Fighter-Bomber Squadron]] of the [[Texas Air National Guard]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ANG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Forging the Air National Guard|url=http://www.ang.af.mil/resources/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=10507&amp;page=1|publisher=[[Air National Guard]]|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he and his fellow pilots viewed as the &quot;bottom of the heap&quot;.{{sfn|Sherwood|1998|p=35}} However, he enjoyed his tenure there and flew the P-38 and [[P-51 Mustang]] in the 1948 [[Cleveland Air Races]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pp=1–2}} Hagerstrom was promoted to [[major (United States)|major]]{{sfn|Werrell|2013|p=155}} and appointed commander of the 111th.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=2}}  In October&amp;nbsp;1950,  the 111th squadron was federalized and ordered into active duty to serve in the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=2}} He was assigned to the headquarters of the [[Tactical Air Command]], where he persuaded the commander to allow him and some other officers to fly a combat tour in Korea, where the war had been fought since June&amp;nbsp;1950. They were allowed to transfer from the Air National Guard into the active-duty Air Force. He was sent to [[Nellis Air Force Base]] in Nevada, where he was instructed by [[William T. Whisner, Jr.]] in gunnery. He then was named operations officer of the [[4th Fighter Group]].{{sfn|Werrell|2013|p=155}}

===Korean War===
Hagerstrom, determined to be an ace in two wars, studied [[MiG-15]] reports, got a silk coat and special glasses that allowed him to see twice as far as normal, and made his own survival kit.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=2}} He later transferred to the [[334th Fighter Squadron]] of the [[Fifth U.S. Air Force]]'s [[18th Wing]], some members of which (including Hagerstrom) were equipped with [[North American F-86 Sabre]]s. Hagerstrom got the wing's first kill of the war on November 21, 1952 near the [[Yalu River]]. The MiG pilot Hagerstrom was shooting at ejected just before his plane exploded, and a piece of that plane was embedded in Hagerstrom's F-86, proving the kill to [[Kimpo Air Base]] group commander [[Royal N. Baker]].{{sfn|Werrell|2013|p=155}} On December&amp;nbsp;25, he got his second kill when the MiG he was chasing at an altitude of {{convert|50000|ft}} spun out of control, and the pilot ejected, most likely dying of exposure to the {{convert|-20|°F|adj=on}} temperatures.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=2}}{{sfn|Werrell|2013|p=155}} In January&amp;nbsp;1953 Hagerstrom was transferred to [[Osan Air Base]] to help with the transition from propeller P-38s to jet F-86s, and by mid-February the wing's 125 pilots were trained in the F-86. On February&amp;nbsp;25 he was chasing two MiGs when he noticed a third attacking another F-86; he engaged and shot it down flying very low over [[Mukden]], China. Low on fuel, he had just enough fuel to land and park the aircraft.{{sfn|Werrell|2013|p=155}}{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|pp=75–76}}

On March&amp;nbsp;13, Hagerstrom and his [[wingman]] Elmer N. Dunlap came across two MiGs, the first of which Hagerstrom &quot;shot the daylights out of&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownwood&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Pilots Tell How They Teamed Up To Shoot Down MIGs|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/823575/|accessdate=August 5, 2014|work=[[Brownwood Bulletin]]|date=March 13, 1953|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shot at the second until he ran out of ammunition, and the remaining MiG was leaking fuel and its engine had stopped. Hagerstrom told Dunlap to &quot;finish off&quot; the crippled plane, and the MiG's pilot bailed over the enemy's [[Dandong Langtou Airport|Antung Airfield]].{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|p=76}} That mission gave him a total of 4.5 victories,&lt;ref name=&quot;half&quot; group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Hagerstrom and Dunlap both received half a kill for the cooperative effort.&lt;/ref&gt; just short of the five kills needed for ace status. On March&amp;nbsp;27 he sneaked up behind six MiGs and fired on one, but by &quot;sheer ass luck ... it knocked his wing tip off.&quot;{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=3}} He kept up the chase, shooting short bursts, until the pilot ejected right above his own base. On the way home, Hagerstrom destroyed another MiG, bringing the total to 6.5. He became the war's 28th ace and would be the only from the 18th wing.{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|p=76}} Before the Air Force sent him back to the U.S., he got one more MiG on April&amp;nbsp;13. The day he left, he unexpectedly went on an impromptu mission, netting his last kill, a sum of 8.5 throughout the whole war{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=4}} over 101 missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;SunPanel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Thirty Fighter Pilots to Form Panel For Discussion of Viet Nam Air War|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2735533/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/|accessdate=July 3, 2015|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino County Sun]]|date=November 25, 1966|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later work===
Hagerstrom remained in the USAF after he returned to the U.S. and was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in June&amp;nbsp;1954.{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|p=78}} He commanded a F-86 squadron at [[Foster Air Force Base]] in [[Victoria, Texas]]{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=4}} and later headed the [[450th Fighter-Day Wing]], equipped with the [[F-100 Super Sabre]].{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|p=78}} In 1956, he was transferred to Headquarters, [[Far East Air Forces]] in Japan as chief of the fighter branch.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=4}} During that tour of duty, he briefly returned to Texas as an advisor for the Air National Guard and on April 13–14, 1957 he was honored by the dedication of its new hangar at [[Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base|Ellington]] Field in Houston as &quot;The James P. Hagerstrom Air National Guard Facility&quot;.&lt;ref name=Densford&gt;{{cite book|last=Densford|first=James T.|title=From Jennies to Jets: The Story of the 111th Squadron|date=June 1973|location=USA|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that spring, he moved to [[Hickam AFB]], [[Hawaii]], when Headquarters, Far East Air Forces (renamed [[Pacific Air Forces]]) relocated from Japan. In Hawaii he earned a [[Master of Economics|master's degree in economics]] and was promoted to the rank of [[colonel (United States)|colonel]] in March&amp;nbsp;1959. In 1960, he left Hawaii for a job with the Air Force Office of Inspector General, Flight Safety Division at [[Norton Air Force Base]] in [[San Bernardino, California]].{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|p=78}}

While at Norton, he studied at [[Loyola Law School]] before attending the [[Industrial College of the Armed Forces]], which required him to relocate to [[Washington, D.C.]] Shortly thereafter he enrolled at [[Georgetown University Law Center]] and completed his studies and earned a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree.{{sfn|Oliver|Lorenz|1999|p=78}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgerton&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Edgerton|first=Karl R.|title=Ace of Two Wars Says: Pressure Cancels Cong Monsoon Drive|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/823465/|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino County Sun]]|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=July 12, 1966|page=2|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next assignment was as vice commander of the [[8th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[George Air Force Base]] in [[Victorville, California]]. In 1965, during the [[Vietnam War]], he was posted to Vietnam to work for the [[Seventh Air Force]]. There, as director of the combat operations control center at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]], he argued with General [[William Westmoreland]] over the Air Force's role in the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]]. Hagerstrom proposed that air assets be used against strategic targets in North Vietnam while Westmoreland insisted that they be used solely in-country to support Army ground operations. Eventually Westmoreland asked the Air Force to remove him from Vietnam.  In early 1966, the Air Force reassigned Hagerstrom to [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]], Thailand where he quickly set up a similar combat operations control center to conduct [[air interdiction]] operations against the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|p=161}}

==Retirement and death==

===Distinguished Service Cross citation===
[[File:Army distinguished service cross medal.png|50px|left]]
{{quotation|First Lieutenant (Air Corps) James P. Hagerstrom (ASN: 0-727447), United States Army Air Forces, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-40 Fighter Airplane in the [[8th Fighter Squadron]], [[49th Fighter Group]], [[Fifth Air Force|FIFTH Air Force]], in aerial combat against enemy forces on 23 January 1944, in the Southwest Pacific. On this date First Lieutenant Hagerstrom shot down four enemy aircraft in a single engagement. First Lieutenant Hagerstrom's unquestionable valor in aerial combat is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, the 5th Air Force, and the United States Army Air Forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Military Times&quot; /&gt;}}
