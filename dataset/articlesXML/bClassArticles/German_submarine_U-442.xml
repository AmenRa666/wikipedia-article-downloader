'''German submarine ''U-442''''' was a [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC|Type VIIC]] [[U-boat]] of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]].

The submarine was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 19 October 1940 at the [[Schichau-Werke]] in [[Danzig]] as yard number 1493, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 17 January 1942, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 21 March 1942 under the command of ''[[Fregattenkapitän]]'' Hans-Joachim Hesse.

''U-442'' first served with the [[5th U-boat Flotilla]], a training unit, and then operationally with the [[7th U-boat Flotilla|7th flotilla]] from 1 October 1942 until the time of her loss.

==Design==
[[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC|German Type VIIC submarines]] were preceded by the shorter [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIB|Type VIIB submarines]]. ''U-442'' had a displacement of {{convert|769|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|871|t|LT}} while submerged.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}} She had a total length of {{convert|67.10|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[pressure hull]] length of {{convert|50.50|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.20|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|9.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|4.74|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two [[Germaniawerft]] F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder [[supercharged]] [[diesel engine]]s producing a total of {{convert|2800 to 3200|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while surfaced, two [[AEG]] GU 460/8–27 [[Motor–generator|double-acting electric motors]] producing a total of {{convert|750|PS|kW shp}} for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two {{convert|1.23|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[propeller]]s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to {{convert|230|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}}

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|17.7|kn}} and a maximum submerged speed of {{convert|7.6|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}} When submerged, the boat could operate for {{convert|80|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|8500|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. ''U-442'' was fitted with five {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen [[torpedo]]es, one [[8.8 cm SK C/35 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} SK C/35 naval gun]], 220 rounds, and an anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a [[Ship's company|complement]] of between forty-four and sixty.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}}

==Service history==

===1st patrol===
''U-442'' departed [[Kiel]] on 17 September 1942 for her first operational war patrol. Heading via the North Sea toward the north-central Atlantic Ocean, she was near [[Iceland]] when convoy UR-42 was sighted. At 16.16 hours on 25 September, ''U-442'' torpedoed and sank her first target, the {{GRT|1,744}} British steam merchant ship {{SS|Empire Bell||2}}. Ten of ''Empire Bell'' 's 37 crew died in the attack, the survivors were picked up by the Norwegian merchantman ''Lysaker IV'' and landed at [[Reykjavík]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uboat.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_815.html
 |title=Patrol of U-boat U-442 from 17 Sep 1942 to 16 Nov 1942
 |last=Helgason
 |first=Guðmundur
 |website=German U-boats of WWII - uboat.net
 |accessdate=2011-08-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a month would pass before ''U-442'' crossed paths with the second and final target of this patrol, the {{GRT|6,690|link=off}} British ammunition ship ''Hatimura''. Already on fire and slowly sinking from an attack three hours earlier (delivered by {{GS|U-132|1941|2}}), the hit resulted in a catastrophic explosion which threw debris in a large radius around the ship. It is believed ''U-132'' was still nearby and was sunk as a result of this detonation.&lt;ref name=&quot;uboat.net&quot;/&gt; The patrol was terminated at [[St. Nazaire]] in occupied France on 3 November 1942.

===2nd patrol===
Her second patrol began 20 December 1942, when she sortied from St. Nazaire bound for the central Atlantic via the [[Bay of Biscay]]. On the morning of 9 January 1943, ''U-442'' attacked [[convoy TM-1]] west of the [[Canary Islands]], claiming hits on two tankers. In reality only one was hit, the {{GRT|9,807|link=off}} steam tanker {{SS|Empire Lytton}}. Fourteen men were lost in this attack. The remaining 34 men abandoned ship and were picked up by {{HMS|Havelock|H88|6}} and {{HMS|Saxifrage|K04|2}}. The escorts attempted to scuttle the British tanker with gunfire before breaking off their efforts and heading for [[Gibraltar]] to land the survivors. Seven hours later (14.50 hours), the burning, drifting tanker was located again by ''U-442'', which torpedoed her a second time; still she would not go down. Finally, a third torpedo at 19.38 hours sent the tanker to the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 1942 ''U-442'' attacked the {{GRT|7,176|link=off}} American [[Liberty Ship]] ''Julia Ward Howe'', a straggler from convoy UGS-4. The first torpedo hit on the starboard side, blowing off a hatch cover, wrecking two lifeboats and destroying the radio equipment. The ship immediately took on a 15-degree list but flooded slowly, gradually righting herself to an even keel. Three shots were fired from the merchantman's defensive 5-inch gun, but no hits were scored. Three men, including the ship's master, died in the attack; seventy-one abandoned ship. One more (the chief engineer), subsequently died of his wounds. Forty minutes after the initial attack, a torpedo struck amidships and broke the ship in two. The submarine then surfaced and took the second mate on board for questioning, releasing him afterward. As the U-boat departed the area, the rafts were secured together and steered toward the [[Azores]]. Fifteen hours later, they were rescued by the Portuguese destroyer [[Portuguese destroyer Lima|''Lima'']] and landed at [[Ponta Delgada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Loss===
''U-442'' met her end on 12 February 1943. She was attacked and sunk by depth charges from a British [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]] aircraft of [[No. 48 Squadron RAF|48 Squadron]] RAF, west of [[Cape St. Vincent]], [[Portugal]]. Her wreck lies at position {{coord|37|32|N|11|56|W}}.

===Wolfpacks===
''U-442'' took part in five [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]s, namely.
* Luchs (27 September - 6 October 1942) 
* Panther (6–12 October 1942) 
* Leopard (12–19 October 1942) 
* [[Wolfpack Veilchen|Veilchen]] (27 October - 4 November 1942) 
* Delphin (26 December 1942 - 12 February 1943)
