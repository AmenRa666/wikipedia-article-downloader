'''No. 86 Wing''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) transport and air-to-air refuelling [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]]. Coming under the control of [[Air Mobility Group RAAF|Air Mobility Group]], it is headquartered at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland. The wing comprises [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron]], operating [[Airbus A330 MRTT|Airbus KC-30]] [[Aerial refueling|tanker-transports]], [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron]], operating [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III]] heavy transports, [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron]], operating [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Beech King Air 350]] light transports, and the [[Australian Army]]'s 68 Ground Liaison Section. Its aircraft support Australian military and humanitarian operations worldwide.

Formed in the last year of [[World War II]] to undertake [[Close air support|ground attack]] missions with [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s and [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]], No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing was reorganised in 1946 as a transport formation headquartered at [[RAAF Station Schofields]], New South Wales, flying [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]]. It relocated to [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales, in 1949 and began operating [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] in 1958. Disbanded in 1964, the wing was re-established at Richmond in 1987, flying [[Boeing 707]] tanker-transports as well as the Hercules. No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron converted to Globemasters in 2006. No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron retired its 707s in 2008, and did not become operational with the KC-30 until 2013. Having previously flown [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou]]s, No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron converted to the King Airs in 2009. The Hercules were transferred to [[No. 84 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing]] in 2010. No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing headquarters relocated from Richmond to Amberley in January 2012.

==History==

===Attack formation (1945–46)===
[[File:No. 1 Squadron RAAF Mosquito (AWM OG3190).jpg|left|thumb|260px||No. 1 Squadron Mosquito, Labuan, August 1945]]
Established in March 1945 under the command of [[Group Captain]] J.M. Whyte, No.&amp;nbsp;86 (Attack) Wing comprised two flying units, [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] operating [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s and [[No. 93 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;93 Squadron]] operating [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s. The wing was initially based on the island of [[Morotai]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]], as part of the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 439–440]&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[order of battle]] for Operation Oboe Six, the [[Battle of North Borneo|assault on north-west Borneo]] commencing in June, included Nos.&amp;nbsp;1 and 93 Squadrons, No.&amp;nbsp;84 Operational Base Unit, No.&amp;nbsp;30 Air Stores Park, No.&amp;nbsp;29 Medical Clearing Station, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Repair and Servicing Unit—a total of over 1,400 personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, ''Oboe'', pp. 57, 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; Delays getting the aircraft operational at their forward base on [[Labuan]] meant that the wing only completed three combat missions before the end of the Pacific War, conducting rocket and machine-gun attacks on targets in [[Sarawak]] during August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/28.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 474–475]&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron took part in one operation and No.&amp;nbsp;93 Squadron in two; each unit lost one aircraft in action.&lt;ref&gt;Parnell; Lynch, ''Australian Air Force Since 1911'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing was originally to have been augmented by a third combat unit, [[No. 94 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;94 Squadron]], flying Mosquitos. Formed in May 1945, the squadron was still undergoing training when the war ended, and it was disbanded at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, in January 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/94sqn.htm |title= No 94 Squadron|publisher=[[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1945, shortly after the end of the Pacific War, the commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;93 Squadron, Squadron Leader D.K.M. Gulliver, crashed his Beaufighter on takeoff at Labuan, colliding with two [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustangs]] of [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron]] parked at the airfield; Gulliver and five people on the ground died in the accident, including the then-Officer Commanding No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing, Group Captain L.C.M. Holswich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=198|title= Beaufighter crash at Labuan|publisher= Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January and March 1946, the Beaufighters escorted Mustangs of [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing]] to Japan for service as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]. In August that year, Nos.&amp;nbsp;1 and 93 Squadrons disbanded at [[Narromine]], New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11127second_world_war.asp|title=93 Squadron RAAF|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', pp. 20, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial transport formation (1946–64)===
[[File:File-86 Wing (AWM P00448-093).jpg|right|thumb|280px|No. 86 Wing Dakotas during a fly-past in 1952]]
Re-formed at [[RAAF Station Schofields]], New South Wales, in July 1946, No.&amp;nbsp;86 (Transport) Wing was assigned control of [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;36]], [[No. 37 Squadron RAAF|37]], and [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|38 Squadrons]], flying [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;APDC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=356 |title=86 Wing ran Japan courier service|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate= 30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parnell&quot;&gt;Parnell; Lynch, ''Australian Air Force Since 1911'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The wing was augmented by No.&amp;nbsp;386 (Base) Squadron and [[No. 486 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;486 (Maintenance) Squadron]], formed in August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance&quot;&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; The Dakotas initially flew supply missions to the Australian-administered [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]], as well as three-times weekly courier flights to Japan in support of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The latter schedule continued until December 1947, when the service was taken over by [[Qantas]] [[Avro Lancastrian]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;APDC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parnell&quot;/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron disbanded in February 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance&quot;/&gt; In August that year, crews from Nos.&amp;nbsp;36 and 38 Squadrons departed for Europe to [[RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift|take part in the Berlin Airlift]], a commitment that lasted almost a year.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=292 |title=RAAF squadron joined Berlin Airlift|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate= 30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians were responsible for delivering over 16&amp;nbsp;million tons of supplies, and almost 8,000 passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance&quot;/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;386 Squadron disbanded in March 1949 and re-formed as Station Headquarters at Schofields.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22&amp;nbsp;June 1949, No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing, comprising Nos.&amp;nbsp;36, 38 and 486 Squadrons, relocated from Schofields to the nearby RAAF Station Richmond.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance&quot;/&gt; The return of crews from Berlin allowed the wing to release No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron and its Dakotas to participate in the [[Malayan Emergency]], under the control of [[No. 90 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;90 (Composite) Wing]], commencing in June 1950. After airlifting more than 17,000 passengers and evacuating over 300 injured troops, the squadron left Malaya in November 1952 and returned to No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing at Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Diggers'', pp. 334–335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 247–249&lt;/ref&gt; A month earlier, the wing's Dakotas had flown supply and observation flights in connection with the [[Operation Hurricane|British atomic test]] on [[Montebello Islands|Montebello]] in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65504778 |title=Atomic Weapon Tested |newspaper=[[Benalla Ensign]] |location=Victoria |date=27 November 1952 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |page=11 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron disbanded at Richmond on 9&amp;nbsp;March 1953, re-forming the next day from [[No. 30 Transport Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30 Transport Unit]] at [[Iwakuni, Yamaguchi|Iwakuni]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=No. 36 Squadron|title =Operations Record Book | url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=1358988&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1 |page=41|publisher= [[National Archives of Australia]]|date=1950–1966| accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here it was part of [[No. 91 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;91 (Composite) Wing]], which controlled the RAAF's units during the [[Korean War]] and its immediate aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron returned to Australia and the aegis of No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing two years later, when No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=404 |title=No 91 (Composite) Wing formed in Japan|publisher= Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RAAF C-130A Hercules (AWM 128872).jpeg|260px|thumb|left|RAAF C-130A Hercules of No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron]]
In 1954, No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing relocated to [[Fairbairn, Canberra|Canberra]] to help satisfy the Federal government's [[Very Important Person|VIP]] transport needs. It returned to Richmond four years later, leaving behind its VIP contingent, No.&amp;nbsp;34 Flight, which in July 1959 was re-formed as [[No. 34 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron]] and left the control of No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing to become an independent unit directly administered by [[RAAF Air Command|Home Command]] and tasked by RAAF Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 416, 426&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Having earlier augmented its complement of Dakotas with [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 440 Metropolitan]]s, in December 1958 the wing began operating [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] medium transports, when No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron took delivery of the first of twelve C-130As. They remained in service for twenty years, clocking up 147,000 accident-free flying hours.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C-130&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A97.htm |title= Lockheed Hercules |publisher=RAAF Museum |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official history of the post-war Air Force described the Hercules as &quot;probably the biggest step-up in aircraft capabilities&quot; the RAAF ever received, considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota, taking into account the improvements in payload, range, and speed.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; When [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 (Fighter) Wing]] and its two [[CAC Sabre]] squadrons deployed to [[RMAF Base Butterworth|RAAF Base Butterworth]] between October 1958 and February 1959, seven Dakotas were required to ferry the staff and equipment of [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] from Australia to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], compared to two Hercules for [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Air Movements and Training Flight (AMTF), previously under No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron and responsible for developing and imparting new techniques in aerial transport, came directly under the control of No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance99&quot;&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; That December, the Hercules carried troops into a combat zone for the first time, when one of No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron's C-130s joined a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo at the beginning of the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|''Konfrontasi'']] between Indonesia and Malaysia; similar missions were undertaken for another five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAAF C-130 at start of Confrontation|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=168|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron received the RAAF's first [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou]] tactical transports in April 1964, replacing its Dakotas. The first six Caribous were despatched that August to South East Asia for service in the [[Vietnam War]] as RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam (RTFV). The same month, No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing was disbanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance102&quot;&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 102, 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Caribous were primarily for support of the [[Australian Army]], an overarching wing headquarters for the Caribous and Hercules was now considered inappropriate. No.&amp;nbsp;486 Squadron was also disbanded and its equipment and staff divided between Nos.&amp;nbsp;36 and 38 Squadrons, which along with AMTF became independently operating units under the command of Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo424&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 424–425&lt;/ref&gt; Following the re-establishment at Richmond of No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron in February 1966, flying C-130E Hercules, No.&amp;nbsp;486 Squadron was re-formed to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo424&quot;/&gt; As No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron's tasking was mainly tactical and No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron's strategic (owing to the longer range of its C-130Es), forming the Hercules units into a new wing was not deemed necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo424&quot;/&gt; Still based at Richmond, the Hercules provided long-range transport and medical evacuation services to and from South East Asia during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance100&quot;&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron's C-130As were replaced by C-130H models in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;C-130&quot;/&gt; RTFV was re-formed as [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;35 Squadron]] in June 1966, and continued to serve in Vietnam until Australian forces were withdrawn in 1972; it was then based in Richmond until 1976, when it relocated to [[RAAF Base Townsville]], Queensland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance102&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 262–263&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron meanwhile continued to operate Caribous out of Richmond until 1992, when it transferred to [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland.&lt;ref name=&quot;38Sqn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/38sqn.htm |title= No 38 Squadron |publisher=RAAF Museum |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Vietnam and post-Vietnam eras, along with their military transport duties, the Hercules and Caribou undertook disaster relief operations throughout Australia and the Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roylance100&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing re-formed at Richmond on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1987, under the newly established [[Air Lift Group RAAF|Air Lift Group]] (ALG), which replaced Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond.
