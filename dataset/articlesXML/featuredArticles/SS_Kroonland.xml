'''SS ''Kroonland''''' was an [[ocean liner]] for [[International Mercantile Marine Co.|International Mercantile Marine]] (IMM) from her [[Ship naming and launching|launch]] in 1902 until scrapped in 1927. ''Kroonland'' was the [[sister ship]] of {{SS|Finland||2}} and a near sister ship of {{SS|Vaderland|1900|2}} and {{SS|Zeeland|1901|2}} of the same company. ''Kroonland'' sailed for IMM's [[Red Star Line]] for 15 years, and also sailed for IMM's [[American Line]] and [[Panama Pacific Line]]. During [[World War I]], the ship served as [[United States Army]] transport '''USAT ''Kroonland''''' through April 1918, and as the [[United States Navy|Navy]] auxiliary '''USS ''Kroonland'' (ID-1541)''' from April 1918 to October 1919.

Announced by the Red Star Line in 1899, ''Kroonland'' was completed in 1902 by [[William Cramp and Sons]] of [[Philadelphia]]. When launched, she was the largest U.S. steamship ever built. ''Kroonland'' sailed from New York City to [[Antwerp]] on her maiden voyage in June 1902, beginning service on the route she would sail for the next twelve years. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Kroonland'' became the first ship to issue a wireless distress call at sea when she radioed for help during a storm in 1903. In another radio first, ''Kroonland'' heard the &quot;first real broadcast of history&quot; in December 1906.&lt;ref name=Bliss-3&gt;Bliss, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kroonland'' was one of ten ships that came to the aid of the burning liner {{SS|Volturno|1906|2}} in the mid-Atlantic in October 1913. Despite stormy seas, ''Kroonland'' was able to take aboard 89 survivors, for which captain and crew received accolades that included U.S. [[Congressional Gold Medal]]s.

When the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 disrupted service to Belgium, ''Kroonland'' shifted to alternate routes. On a trip to the Mediterranean in October 1914, ''Kroonland'' was detained by British authorities at [[Gibraltar]], and part of her cargo was confiscated amidst diplomatic wrangling between the then-neutral United States and the United Kingdom. During a [[chartering (shipping)|chartered]] circumnavigation of South America in February 1915, ''Kroonland'' became the largest passenger ship to date to transit the [[Panama Canal]]. ''Kroonland'' was placed in New York – Panama Canal – San Francisco service until a landslide temporarily closed the canal to navigation. Returned to transatlantic service, ''Kroonland'' was one of the first U.S. ships armed by the Navy for defense against German submarine attacks. In May 1917 ''Kroonland'' was struck by a torpedo, which failed to detonate and only slightly damaged the ship.

After the United States entered World War I, ''Kroonland'' served as a troopship for the U.S. Army and Navy. She made six trips carrying troops to France before the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] and eight voyages after, transporting nearly 38,000 troops in total. Returned to IMM in late 1919, ''Kroonland'' was scorched in a shipyard fire in January 1920 while she was being refitted for passenger service. The liner resumed North Atlantic service in April, remaining there until returning to New York – San Francisco service in 1923. ''Kroonland'' inaugurated IMM's winter New York – Miami service from December 1925 to March 1926, but was laid up in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], when IMM did not resume the Miami service the following year. The ship was sold and scrapped at [[Genoa]] in 1927.

== Design and construction ==
In July 1899, the [[Red Star Line]] announced plans for the construction of four large ocean liners. Two ships, ''Kroonland'' and {{SS|Finland||2}}, were to be built at [[William Cramp and Sons]] in [[Philadelphia]], and the others, {{SS|Vaderland|1900|2}} and {{SS|Zeeland|1901|2}}, at [[John Brown &amp; Company]] of [[Clydebank]] in Scotland.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-2-840&gt;Bonsor, p. 840.&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1901, the two Scottish-built ships were completed and in service for Red Star,&lt;ref name=Bonsor-2-840 /&gt; with the construction of the American pair well underway.

''Kroonland'' and the virtually identical ''Finland'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Naval Historical Center]] | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-k/id1541.htm | title = Online Library of Selected Images: U.S. Navy ships: USS ''Kroonland'' (ID # 1541), 1918–1919 | date = 9 March 2008 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at {{GRT|12,760|disp=long}} each,&lt;ref name=Bonsor-2-856&gt;Bonsor, p. 856.&lt;/ref&gt; were slightly larger than ''Vaderland'' and ''Zeeland''.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-2-855&gt;Bonsor, p. 855.&lt;/ref&gt; The American pair were the largest steamships built in the United States at the time of their launch,&lt;ref name=SciAm-1902&gt;{{cite journal | title = Marine Transportation | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = LXXXVII | issue = 24 | pages = 388 | date = 13 December 1902 | location = New York | publisher = Munn and Company | issn = 0036-8733 | oclc = 1775222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were the highest tonnage civilian ships ever built by William Cramp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Colton | first = Tim | title = William Cramp &amp; Sons Shipbuilding Co., Philadelphia PA | url = http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/2large/inactive/cramp.htm | work = Shipbuildinghistory.com | publisher = Colton Companies | accessdate = 21 June 2008 }} U.S. Navy ships listed are by displacement.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kroonland'' was {{convert|560|ft|m|1}} long ([[length between perpendiculars|pp]]) and {{convert|60|ft|m|1|adj=on}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]], with a [[molded depth]] of {{convert|42|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=SciAm-1902 /&gt; Her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was steel and nearly all the rivets were set with [[rivet gun|pneumatic rivet guns]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kroonland'' was propelled at up to {{convert|17|kn|km/h}} by twin [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s. The engines were each rated at {{convert|5100|ihp}} and had cylinders of {{convert|32.5|in|cm}}, {{convert|54|in|cm}}, and {{convert|89.5|in|cm}} with a {{convert|42|in|cm|adj=on}} stroke. There were nine single-ended coal-fired [[Scotch boiler]]s with a heating area of {{convert|22400|sqft}}, a grate area of {{convert|643|sqft}}, and an operating pressure of {{convert|170|psi}}.&lt;ref name=SciAm-1902 /&gt; ''Kroonland'' had eleven watertight compartments with reinforced bulkheads, and was designed to remain afloat with up to two compartments flooded. ''Kroonland''{{'}}s coal bunkers surrounded the boilers, to offer limited protection in case the ship was used in wartime.&lt;ref name=Cramp-133&gt;William Cramp, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rsl 18 crop mod.jpg|thumb|left|The first-class passengers [[smoking room]] on SS ''Kroonland'', c. 1909]]
The area below the main deck could carry up to {{convert|11000|LT|MT}} of freight and stores. ''Kroonland''{{'}}s water tanks could carry {{convert|200|LT|MT}} of fresh water. Refrigerated storage was provided for meats and other perishables.&lt;ref name=Cramp-134&gt;William Cramp, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-class passenger accommodations were located on the main deck: three compartments for men located forward, and a single compartment for families at the rear. The family compartment had [[state room]]s containing either two, four, or six bunks. All compartments had well-lighted dining areas and wide hallways that led to lavatories and sanitary facilities on the upper deck.&lt;ref name=Cramp-134 /&gt;

The upper deck housed facilities for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long [[forecastle]] contained the accommodations for the crew and [[petty officer]]s, as well as a hospital and the third-class lavatories.&lt;ref name=Cramp-135&gt;William Cramp, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close to the middle of the ship. To their rear, between the [[steamship funnel|funnels]], was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured [[mahogany]] furniture and [[Chloroxylon|satinwood]] paneling with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks.&lt;ref name=Cramp-134 /&gt; Beyond this area were the [[galley (kitchen)|galleys]], [[scullery (room)|sculleries]], and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.&lt;ref name=Cramp-135 /&gt;

A {{convert|220|ft|m|adj=on}} long [[Deck (ship)#Common names for decks|bridge deck]] amidships contained state rooms for another 204 first-class and 120 second-class passengers. In the rear was a deck house that contained a social room for third-class passengers. A [[promenade deck]] was located above and was permanently enclosed by a [[boat deck]],&lt;ref name=Cramp-135 /&gt; where ''Kroonland''{{'}}s 20 steel [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] were stowed.&lt;ref name=Cramp-136&gt;William Cramp, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The promenade deck housed the library and smoking room for first-class passengers.&lt;ref name=Cramp-135 /&gt;

''Kroonland'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on the afternoon of 20 February 1902 in a small, informal ceremony. Mrs. Rodman Griscom christened the ship, but ''Kroonland'' did not budge on the [[slipway#Ship construction|launching way]]; cold weather had frozen the [[tallow]] used to grease the timbers. [[Hydraulic jack]]s eventually freed the ship for her plunge into the [[Delaware River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9B02E4D81530E733A25752C2A9649C946397D6CF | format = pdf | title = Huge steamship launched |work=The New York Times | date = 21 February 1902 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Red Star Line service, 1902–1914 ==
''Kroonland'' sailed on her maiden voyage from New York to Antwerp on 28 June 1902. ''Kroonland'' remained on New York – Antwerp service for the next twelve years.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /&gt; In these early years of service, she was involved in two radio firsts. After the steering gear failed {{convert|130|nmi|km}} west of [[Fastnet Rock]] during a moderate gale in early December 1903, the ship's crew was able to communicate their predicament via [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] [[radio|wireless]] system,&lt;ref name=Williams-27&gt;Williams, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming, according to one contemporary news account, the first ship in distress ever to use wireless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D0CE2D71039E333A2575AC0A9649D946297D6CF | format = pdf | title = The Kroonland disabled | work = The New York Times | date = 9 December 1903 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kroonland'' put in at [[Queenstown, Ireland|Queenstown]], Ireland, for repairs,&lt;ref name=Williams-27 /&gt; and transferred her passengers and freight to ships of the [[White Star Line]], another IMM subsidiary.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;''Kroonland''{{'}}s first- and second-class passengers were transferred to [[SS Teutonic (1889)|RMS ''Teutonic'']] and third-class passengers were transferred to another, unreported steamer. See: {{cite news | title = Get money at sea | work = [[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]] | date = 10 December 1903 | page = 1 }}&lt;br&gt; Cargo was transferred onto {{RMS|Bovic||2}}. Freight customers ended up paying twice for the shipments because [[Red Star Line|Red Star]] and [[White Star Line|White Star]], even though both subsidiaries of [[International Mercantile Marine]], were separate companies. See: {{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=980CE7DB163EE033A25755C2A9679C946597D6CF | format = pdf | title = Made consignees pay twice for freight | work = The New York Times | date = 26 January 1904 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other radio first came on 24 December 1906, when the ship's wireless operator heard—rather than the expected dots and dashes of morse code—the voice of a woman singing. The singing was followed by a recording of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s &quot;[[Ombra mai fù|Largo]]&quot;, a poetry reading, and more music played from phonographs. The steamer was on the receiving end of what journalist and author [[Robert St. John]] called the &quot;first real broadcast of history&quot;, originated by early radio pioneer [[Reginald Fessenden]] from [[Brant Rock]] in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Bliss-3 /&gt;

During her time on the New York – Antwerp route, ''Kroonland'' was frequently battered by the storms that were typical in the North Atlantic. In November 1904, a [[Brussels]] news agency reported a rumor that the ship had foundered in a mid-ocean storm. The report—proved false when ''Kroonland'' safely docked in New York&lt;ref name=WP-1904-11-22&gt;{{cite news | title = Kroonland safe in port |work=The Washington Post | date = 22 November 1904 | page = 2 }})&lt;/ref&gt;—received wide coverage in the American press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Kroonland foundered? |work=Los Angeles Times | date = 20 November 1904 | page = 1 }} Also, {{cite news | title = Great steamship may have foundered in midocean | work = Chicago Daily Tribune | date = 20 November 1904 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in a heavy December gale, the ship was struck by what contemporary news accounts referred to as a &quot;[[rogue wave|tidal wave]]&quot; as high as the tops of her funnels. The wave crashed over the deck, and brought the ship to a standstill. A Belgian passenger's leg was broken when he was thrown into a wall, and a crewman on watch in the [[crow's nest]] was sent tumbling to the deck {{convert|40|ft|m}} below with only minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Struck by tidal wave | work = The Washington Post | date = 22 December 1904 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another December gale in 1907, one of the two [[propeller shaft]]s on ''Kroonland'' broke while the liner was off the [[Isles of Scilly]]. Using the lone remaining propeller, the liner was able to make her way back to [[Southampton]], where two tugs brought her into port. Passengers were transferred to {{SS|Majestic|1890|2}} to continue their transit to New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D04E2DB1738E033A25752C1A9649D946697D6CF | format = pdf | title = Kroonland towed to port | work = The New York Times | date = 11 December 1907 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Kroonland'' entered drydock at Southampton. Fitted with a new shaft, she sailed—without passengers and cargo—for New York, where she arrived on 2 January 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9906E1DC173EE233A25750C0A9679C946997D6CF | format = pdf | title = Ship in without passengers | work = The New York Times | date = 3 January 1908 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1910, severe winter storms on the North Atlantic extended one of ''Kroonland''{{'}}s westbound trips, delaying her arrival in New York by three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9506E5D7143BE733A25756C2A9649C946196D6CF | format = pdf | title = Liners delayed by gales | work = The New York Times | date = 25 February 1910 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, ''Kroonland'' broke another propeller shaft, and again headed to Southampton for repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=980DE6DA1530E233A25755C1A9639C946196D6CF | format = pdf | title = Kroonland's shaft broken | work = The New York Times | date = 16 May 1910 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the ship's mishaps were storm-related. In late April 1911, ''Kroonland'' hit the breakwater in [[Dover Harbour]], disabling the steering gear and delaying the ship by a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D02E1DA1439E333A25752C0A9639C946096D6CF | format = pdf | title = Kroonland slightly disabled | work = The New York Times | date = 1 May 1911 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 January 1913, ''Kroonland'' ran aground in [[Ambrose Channel]] during a heavy fog while outbound from New York.

The Red Star Line changed ''Kroonland'' from American to Belgian registry on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason given for the change was to allow Red Star to hire non-American crews at lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = American flag is lowered | work = The Washington Post | date = 6 November 1908 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her maiden voyage under the [[Flag of Belgium|Belgian flag]] the next day.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /&gt; In May 1911, ''Kroonland''{{'}}s crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, refused to sign on for the ship's next voyage, forcing Red Star to hire a replacement crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=980DE7D71439E333A2575BC2A9639C946096D6CF | format = pdf | title = Kroonland's crew quits | work = The New York Times | date = 28 May 1911 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Typically, crew members had no contracts and had to &quot;sign on&quot; after each voyage.

International Mercantile Marine submitted a bid for a ten-year contract for ''Kroonland'' and ''Finland'' to carry U.S. mail between New York and San Francisco after the opening of the [[Panama Canal]]. By law, only U.S.-flagged ships could carry U.S. mail under contract. It was also anticipated that U.S.-flagged vessels would receive preferential treatment for canal tolls.&lt;ref&gt;Vose, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; In a short ceremony aboard the liner in New York Harbor on 27 December 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Vose, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; the Belgian flag was lowered and the American flag was raised to the playing of &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot; by the steamer's band, shortly before she sailed for Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Red Star Line ships added to the U.S. Merchant Marine | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 27 December 1911 | page = 1 }} ''Finland''{{'}}s registry was changed on 3 January 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Volturno'' rescue ===
At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, {{SS|Volturno|1906|2}}, a Royal Line ship under charter to the Uranium Line, caught fire in a gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the fire for about two hours, but, realizing the severity of the fire and the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of ''Volturno'' had his wireless operator send out [[SOS]] signals. The westbound ''Kroonland'', already beyond ''Volturno''{{'}}s location, turned east to aid the burning liner.&lt;ref name=NYT-1913-10-17&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9806E1DC133FE633A25754C1A9669D946296D6CF | format = pdf | title = Inch gives his dog to Capt.

In all, ten ships heeded the distress calls, arriving throughout the day and into the next.&lt;ref name=WP-1913-10-12 /&gt; ''Kroonland'' arrived at about 17:00, and by 20:00 had launched a lifeboat with a volunteer crew. The boat was unable to get close to the burning liner. ''Kroonland''{{'}}s lifeboat returned at 22:30 with an exhausted crew and the one person who had dared to brave the jump into the stormy water.&lt;ref name=NYT-1913-10-17 /&gt; Captain J. C. Barr of {{RMS|Carmania|1905|2}}, the first ship to arrive, took command of the rescue effort. Barr had the vessels form a &quot;[[battle line]]&quot; of sorts and slowly circle the burning ship, while his ship kept a searchlight on ''Volturno'' and another sweeping the ring of rescue ships to help them avoid collisions.&lt;ref name=WP-1913-10-12 /&gt; Despite ''Carmania''{{'}}s efforts, ''Kroonland'' and the [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique|French Line]] steamer {{SS|La Touraine||2}} almost collided, coming—according to one passenger—within {{convert|15|ft|m}} of impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9405E6DB133FE633A2575AC1A9669D946296D6CF | format = pdf | title = Ships near a crash in aiding Volturno | work = The New York Times | date = 19 October 1913 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Paul H. Kreibohm retouched.jpg|thumb|right|For his part in helping rescue victims of the {{SS|Volturno|1906|2}} fire, ''Kroonland''{{'}}s captain, [[Paul H. Kreibohm]], was made a [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Chevalier of the Order of the Crown]], and received a gold watch, a [[Congressional Gold Medal]], and a [[Sea Gallantry Medal|Silver Sea Gallantry Medal]].]]
''Kroonland''{{'}}s lifeboat, manned by a fresh crew, headed back out and returned with 13 steerage passengers.&lt;ref name=NYT-1913-10-17 /&gt; On board ''Volturno'', the crew and some of the male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her [[boiler]]s—rocked ''Volturno'', and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] ''Narragansett'' turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface.&lt;ref name=WP-1913-10-12 /&gt; The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to ''Volturno''{{'}}s aid. ''Kroonland'' launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship.&lt;ref name=NYT-1913-10-17 /&gt; In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on ''Kroonland'' alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.&lt;ref name=WP-1913-10-12 /&gt;

With all boats recovered by 09:00, the liners resumed their original courses.&lt;ref name=WP-1913-10-12 /&gt; ''Kroonland'' turned west and continued on to the United States, hampered by a cracked crankshaft that slowed her to {{convert|12|kn|km/h}}. During her slow passage to New York, ''Kroonland''{{'}}s cabin passengers drafted a resolution honoring Captain Kreibohm and the crew for their actions during the rescue, and raised $700 for the benefit of the ''Volturno'' survivors. ''Kroonland'' finally docked in New York on 16 October.&lt;ref name=NYT-1913-10-17 /&gt;

The crew, like those of the other nine ships involved, received many accolades for its rescue efforts. After sending the ship a congratulatory telegram at the time of the rescue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = King of the Belgians and the rescuers |work=The Times  | date = 17 October 1913 | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] of Belgium made Capt.

''Kroonland'' resumed her normal New York – Antwerp service until 11 August 1914,&lt;ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /&gt; when she arrived at New York with passengers that had narrowly escaped the hostilities beginning to engulf the European continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=940CEEDC1430E733A25751C1A96E9C946596D6CF | format = pdf | title = Fled on Kroonland as the war started | work = The New York Times | date = 12 August 1914 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable passengers ===
During her pre-war New York – Antwerp sailings, ''Kroonland'' carried some notable and interesting passengers. On 1 August 1904, one of the ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or luggage, she was barred from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B0CE0DC113DE633A25750C0A96E9C946597D6CF | format = pdf | title = Woman crosses ocean in an evening gown | work = The New York Times | date = 3 August 1904 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After her predicament was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'', she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=980CE1DB113DE633A25757C0A96E9C946597D6CF | format = pdf | title = Curious go to gaze at one-gowned traveler | work = The New York Times | date = 4 August 1904 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same month ''The New York Times'' reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, ''Kroonland''{{'}}s crew took all the dogs back to the kennel. Many of the dog owners refused to speak to the others involved for the duration of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9804E5D81230E132A25753C3A96E9C946597D6CF | format = pdf | title = Sea dogs make 1,000 leagues of trouble | work = The New York Times | date = 30 August 1904 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 1905, American author [[Molly Elliot Seawell]] sailed for Europe on ''Kroonland'' on a day when six liners, with over 1,500 passengers, departed New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=950CE3D7133EE733A25754C2A9639C946497D6CF | format = pdf | title = 1,500 in liners' cabins to sail abroad to-day | work = The New York Times | date = 27 May 1905 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, [[Helen Herron Taft|Helen Taft]] returned from Europe on ''Kroonland'' and was met by her husband, Secretary of War [[William Howard Taft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9803E5DF143DE733A2575AC0A9669D946497D6CF | format = pdf | title = Government to buy Fort Hamilton land | work = The New York Times | date = 9 October 1905 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next August, [[Henry Yates Satterlee]], the first [[Episcopal Diocese of Washington|Episcopal Bishop of Washington]], returned on ''Kroonland'' from a six-week tour of cathedrals of Europe, during which he noted both good and bad design elements of cathedrals in preparation for the building of the [[Washington National Cathedral]]. Also returning on the same voyage were Admiral [[Charles Stillman Sperry|Charles Sperry]] and Lieutenant Daniel W. Wurtsbaugh of the U.S. Navy, and Brigadier General [[Robert Maitland O'Reilly|Robert O'Reilly]], the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]]; all were American delegates to the [[Second Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C02E3D8143DE733A25757C1A96E9C946797D6CF | format = pdf | title = Bishop Satterlee's return | work = The New York Times | date = 14 August 1906 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the first trip on ''Kroonland'' for either Satterlee and O'Reilly. Satterlee had traveled on the liner the previous May to visit the spa town of [[Bad Nauheim]] in Hesse;&lt;ref&gt;Brent, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly had been on the November 1904 trip in which ''Kroonland'' had been reported as sunk.&lt;ref name=WP-1904-11-22 /&gt;

''Kroonland'' was the scene of an attempted [[murder-suicide]] in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over the railing into the English Channel near [[Dover]]. U.S. Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E07E2DC1739E333A25752C2A9669D946997D6CF | format = pdf | title = Fight and suicide at sea | work = The New York Times | date = 21 October 1908 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American actresses [[Kitty Cheatham]] and [[Isabel Irving]]—each married to a different man named &quot;W. H. Thompson&quot;—traveled on ''Kroonland'' in May 1910. Alerted to each other's presence when mail addressed to &quot;Mrs. W. H. Thompson&quot; was confused, the actresses—old friends, having both worked in the theatre company of [[Augustin Daly]]—shared a state room for the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C05EEDE1530E233A25752C0A9639C946196D6CF | format = pdf | title = Mrs. W.

''Kroonland'' was tangentially involved in a more sinister affair in July 1910. American physician [[Hawley Harvey Crippen|Hawley Crippen]] and his lover, Ethel La Neve, had fled England after the circumstances around his wife's death were questioned. After a body was found in the basement of Crippen's North London residence, [[Scotland Yard]] Chief Inspector [[Walter Dew]] sought the couple for murder charges.&lt;ref name=AC-1910-11-23&gt;{{cite news | title = Crippen hanged in London jail at dawn of day | work = [[The Atlanta Constitution]] | date = 23 November 1910 | pages = 1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory had the couple sailing from [[Dover]] on ''Kroonland'', but when inspected in New York on arrival, Crippen and Le Neve were not to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Saw Crippen in train | work = The Washington Post | date = 20 July 1910 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fleeing couple had instead sailed from Antwerp on the [[Canadian Pacific Steamship Company|Canadian Pacific]] liner {{SS|Montrose|1897|2}}. Crippen, identified during ''Montrose''{{'}}s crossing, was arrested, convicted of his wife's murder, and hanged; La Neve was acquitted.&lt;ref name=AC-1910-11-23 /&gt;

The American novelist [[Theodore Dreiser]], returning from an extended European tour in April 1912, briefly considered returning on {{RMS|Titanic}}, but instead sailed two days later on the American-flagged—and less expensive—''Kroonland''. Dreiser recounted the gloomy mood of ''Kroonland''{{'}}s passengers after hearing the news of ''Titanic''{{'}}s sinking, observing that the &quot;terror of the sea had come swiftly and directly home to all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, pp. 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt; On ''Kroonland''{{'}}s next return trip to New York, [[Horst von der Goltz]], a self-described German secret agent, eluded German authorities by working as a steward in steerage aboard the liner.&lt;ref&gt;von der Goltz, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the German invasion of Belgium in early August 1914, ''Kroonland'' was switched to New York – Liverpool service.

Frequent and progressively worse landslides in the canal disrupted ''Kroonland''{{'}}s and ''Finland''{{'}}s service.

[[Image:Liverpool Pier Head by night.jpg|thumb|right|During ''Kroonland''{{'}}s time on New York – Liverpool service, she would have been greeted by The Three Graces of [[Liverpool]]'s [[Pier Head]].]]
The delay caused by the October slide in the Panama Canal created uncertainty for the immediate future of ''Kroonland''. Her  sister ship ''Finland'' was transferred to a New York – London route almost immediately after the canal's closure, but ''Kroonland'' was &quot;trapped&quot; on the west side of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Steamer Finland, in canal service, to go to Europe | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 23 October 1915 | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By early November, ''Kroonland''—loaded with cargo destined for the United Kingdom, and sailing under the banner of the [[American Line]]—departed San Francisco for London, via the Straits of Magellan.

While returning from Liverpool in early February 1917, passengers and crew on ''Kroonland'' witnessed the German U-boat {{SMS|UC-46||2|sub=y}} sink the Dutch ship ''Gamma'' off the Irish coast.&lt;ref name=NYT-1917-02-12&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B02E5DB1538EE32A25751C1A9649C946696D6CF | format = pdf | title = Kroonland here; saw U-boat raid | work = The New York Times | date = 12 February 1917 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/7043.html | title = Ships hit during WWI: Gamma | work = The U-boat War | publisher = Uboat.net | accessdate = 21 June 2008 }} According to the source, there was only one Dutch ship sunk on 1 February 1917, ''Gamma'', which was sunk off the coast of Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 1917, at around 15:30, passengers and crew saw the German submarine overtake and stop the Dutch [[cargo ship|freighter]]. At about 16:15, the U-boat, by then on the far side of the Dutch ship and out of view from ''Kroonland'', fired three shots from her deck gun. ''Gamma'' immediately began listing to port and sank within five minutes. ''Kroonland'' was less than {{convert|5|nmi|km}} away, and was prepared to rescue the crew of the sunken ship, but stopped when the German submarine took ''Gamma''{{'}}s lifeboat in tow.&lt;ref name=NYT-1917-02-12 /&gt; Four days later, a suspected submarine was seen {{convert|5|nmi|km}} off ''Kroonland''{{'}}s port side, and there were other reports of a ship that passengers took to be a German [[commerce raider]] or [[submarine tender]].&lt;ref name=WP-1917-02-12 /&gt;

Because Germany had [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)#1917: Resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare|resumed unrestricted submarine warfare]] again on 1 February, ''Kroonland'' was laid up for almost two months at the American Line piers in New York, along with sister ship ''Finland'' and three other vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Five in from war zone | work = The Washington Post | date = 23 February 1917 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Kroonland | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/k5/kroonland.htm | short = on}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this forced downtime, ''Kroonland'' was converted from coal burning to oil burning, a long-awaited modification that had been announced in October 1915.&lt;ref name=NYT-1917-02-24&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A06E2DE123BEE3ABC4C51DFB466838C609EDE | format = pdf | title = Kroonland will use oil | work = The New York Times | date = 24 February 1917 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ships and Shipping: Oil Burners | journal = Information Annual | volume = 1915 | pages = 536 | location = New York | publisher = [[R.R.

Because fuel oil was stored inside the [[double bottom]] of her hull, her cargo capacity was increased through the elimination of her coal bunkers.&lt;ref name=NYT-1917-02-24 /&gt; The labor savings and the additional freight revenues from the increased cargo space resulted in a net gain of $25,000 income per trip.&lt;ref&gt;Burling, p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Troopship duties ==
''Kroonland'' served as a [[troopship]] for about the next year.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Sources are unclear under what purview ''Kroonland'' sailed. Bonsor (p. 856) simply lists &quot;1917 US troopship&quot;.

On the morning of 20 May, while the liner steamed toward Liverpool through a heavy fog, a torpedo struck her without exploding.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; Two minutes later her lookouts spotted a submarine bearing down on ''Kroonland'' so close alongside the liner that her guns could not be depressed enough to open fire on the raider. Although the U-boat, apparently also taken by surprise, reversed her screws and tried to turn to avoid a collision, she lightly struck the liner's hull and scraped along her side before diving out of sight. Meanwhile, two more torpedoes came within some {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} of hitting ''Kroonland''{{'}}s stern. That afternoon the liner sighted another submarine, surfaced some {{convert|1000|yd|m}} off her port quarter. ''Kroonland'' immediately began shelling the U-boat, forcing the submarine to dive for safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; In early June, this failed torpedo attack on the ship made front page news in American newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=950DE0D6123AE433A25757C0A9609C946696D6CF | format = pdf | title = Says two torpedoes hit the Kroonland | work = New York Times | date = 4 June 1917 | accessdate = 21 June 2008 | page = 1 }} {{cite news | title = Torpedoes graze Kroonland as two submarines attack | work = The Washington Post | date = 4 June 1917 | page = 1 }} {{cite news | title = Four torpedoes fired at U.S. liner Kroonland by two German U-boats | work = The Atlanta | date = 4 June 1917 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 1917, the {{USSB|first=yes}} requisitioned all American passenger ships over {{GT|2,500}} for use by the government in the war effort. Though it is not clear what immediate impact this had on ''Kroonland'',&lt;ref name=CW-319&gt;Crowell and Wilson, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; it is known that the liner was operating as a U.S. Army transport (under the name USAT ''Kroonland'') by February 1918, when she was loaded with [[materiel]] and departed New York for [[Saint-Nazaire]], France.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot;/&gt;

In February 1918 the {{USSB}} assigned ''Kroonland'' to the transport fleet as an U.S. Army Chartered Transport (USACT),&lt;ref name=CW-320&gt;Crowell and Wilson, pp. 320, 647.&lt;/ref&gt; and after her return from France on 9 April, she was converted to a troop transport in New York by the William J. Kennedy Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot;/&gt; A typical conversion from passenger liner to troop transport involved having all of the second- and third-class accommodations ripped out and replaced with berths for troops. Cooking and toilet facilities also had to be greatly expanded to handle the large numbers of men aboard.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell and Wilson, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Navy transport duties ==
After problems with crew discipline aboard Army transports {{USAT|Antilles||2}} and {{USAT|Finland||2}} when they were torpedoed, the U.S. Navy, led by the recommendations of Rear Admiral [[Albert Gleaves]], insisted that all troop transports be manned entirely by Navy personnel. This was accomplished soon after, to avoid the need for what Gleaves called &quot;ignorant and unreliable men&quot; who were &quot;the sweepings of the docks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gleaves, pp. 108–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, ''Kroonland'' was handed over to the Navy on 22 April and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] the same day, with [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Manley H. Simons in command.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot;/&gt;

=== Transporting troops to France ===
USS ''Kroonland'' was assigned to the [[Cruiser and Transport Force]] after being commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;Gleaves, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship departed New York on 30 April with the transports {{USS|Matsonia|ID-1589|2}}, {{SS|Manchuria|1903|2}}, and ''Finland''. {{USS|Martha Washington|ID-3019|2}} and {{USS|Powhatan|ID-3013|2}}—two transports that sailed from [[Newport News, Virginia]]—rendezvoused with ''Kroonland''{{'}}s group. {{USS|South Dakota|ACR-9|2}} provided the convoy with protection until its arrival in France on 12 May. ''Kroonland'' returned to New York on 1 June.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell and Wilson, p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kroonland'' next left New York on 15 June with ''Finland'', {{USS|DeKalb|ID-3010|2}}, {{USS|George Washington|ID-3018|2}}, {{USS|Covington|ID-1409|2}}, {{USS|Rijndam|ID-2505|2}}, the Italian steamer {{SS|Dante Alighieri||2}}, and the British steamer ''Vauban'' and met up with the Newport News portion of the convoy—consisting of {{USAT|Lenape||2}}, {{USS|Wilhelmina|ID-2168|2}}, {{USS|Princess Matoika|ID-2290|2}}, {{USS|Pastores|AF-16|2}}, and the British troopship {{HMT|Czar||2}} (another fellow ''Volturno'' rescuer)&lt;ref name=Sea_Gallantry /&gt;—the next morning and set out for France. The convoy was escorted by the cruisers {{USS|North Carolina|ACR-12|2}} and {{USS|Frederick|CA-8|2}}, and the destroyers {{USS|Stevens|DD-86|2}} and {{USS|Fairfax|DD-93|2}}; the battleship {{USS|Texas|BB-35|2}} and several other destroyers joined in escort duties for the group for a time.

On 10 July,&lt;ref&gt;Gleaves, on p. 170, reports the date as 20 July.&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Kroonland'' steamed homeward from France, a lookout spotted a periscope rising from the water about {{convert|200|yd|m|-1}} away. ''Kroonland'' opened fire and the fourth shot from her No. 4 gun &quot;burst with a tremendous cloud of dirty blue smoke&quot; exactly on the periscope. The submarine zig-zagged &quot;erratically back and forth until she was directly in the disturbed water&quot; of ''Kroonland''{{'}}s wake.

On 26 July, ''Kroonland'', loaded with 3,248 officers and men,&lt;ref&gt;Crowell and Wilson, p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt; departed on her next trip to France. In the company of ''Finland'' and the Italian steamer {{SS|Taormina|1908|2}}, she met up with {{USS|Pocahontas|ID-3044|2}}, {{USS|Susquehanna|ID-3016|2}}, and the Italian steamers {{SS|Duca d'Aosta||2}} and {{SS|Caserta||2}} from Newport News.&lt;ref name=C&amp;W-614&gt;Crowell and Wilson, p. 614.&lt;/ref&gt; The cruisers {{USS|Pueblo|CA-7|2}}, {{USS|Huntington|CA-5|2}}, and destroyers {{USS|Rathburne|DD-113|2}} and {{USS|Colhoun|DD-85|2}} escorted the transports.&lt;ref name=CW-Colhoun&gt;Crowell and Wilson list the destroyer as &quot;''Calhoun''&quot;.

He stated that the soldiers wore overalls rather than uniforms, and were required to wear life jackets at all times. During the early mornings, the most dangerous time for submarines according to Van Kleeck, the soldiers had to stand by their life rafts until the sun was completely up. Bathing facilities were too small, so several times during the trip the soldiers gathered on deck for salt water baths, which consisted of a hose turned on them by the ship's crew. On 2 August, ''Finland'' developed engine trouble and fell back from the convoy, but by the next day, she and a destroyer that stayed with her had rejoined the convoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Van Kleeck | first = Gordon | url = http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~treebz65/momside/vankleeck/gordonvk/gvkjournal/gvkjournal2.html | title = Pvt.

== Red Star Line service, 1920–1923 ==
After her return to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship underwent a refit at the [[W. &amp; A. Fletcher Company|W. &amp; A.

''Kroonland'' began her last voyage on the Antwerp route in January 1923, after which she underwent a refit during the first half of 1923. The ship was converted to cabin- and third-class passengers only,&lt;ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /&gt; and was painted white.&lt;ref name=LAT-1923-07-09&gt;{{cite news | title = Service of fast liners for harbor | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 9 July 1923 | page = I–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for her announced return to the Panama Pacific Line in October 1923, more refrigeration and cool air space were added for transporting Southern California agricultural products.&lt;ref name=LAT-1923-07-09 /&gt;

After this refit, the ship was briefly assigned to the American Line for three roundtrips on a New York to [[Hamburg]] route, with intermediate stops at Plymouth and [[Cherbourg]].&lt;ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /&gt; On her first Hamburg trip, she carried American comedic actress [[Florence Shirley]] and her husband, headed for a European vacation. [[Cecil Arden]], a [[mezzo-soprano]] with the [[Metropolitan Opera]], and [[botanist]] [[Otto Warburg (botanist)|Otto Warburg]] sailed on the same trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Norwegian fjords attract tourists | work = The New York Times | date = 21 June 1923 | page = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panama Pacific Line service, 1923–1925 ==
In April 1923, IMM announced that ''Kroonland'' and sister ship ''Finland'' would be returned to the Panama Pacific Line beginning in late September, sailing from New York to San Francisco via [[Havana]], the Panama Canal, and Los Angeles, with Los Angeles being the west coast hub of operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Two large ships will come here | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 30 April 1923 | page = II–22 }} In June, ''Manchuria'' was also assigned to the route. See: {{cite news | title = I.M.M. Panama-Pacific Line | work = The Wall Street Journal | date = 22 June 1923 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October, ''Kroonland'' departed on her first voyage on the route since 1915.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /&gt; ''Kroonland'' arrived in [[Port of Los Angeles|Los Angeles Harbor]] on 3 November amidst fanfare, becoming the largest liner to date to enter that harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Relinks New York with the Pacific | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 3 November 1923 | page = II–1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;On ''Kroonland''{{'}}s previous visits, she had to anchor offshore and use [[lighter (barge)|lighters]] to transfer passengers and cargo. See: {{cite news | title = Notables welcome Kroonland | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 4 November 1923 | page = I–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SS Kroonland in Panama Canal, 1923.jpg|thumb|left|''Kroonland'' passes through the Pedro Miguel Locks of the [[Panama Canal]] on 23 October 1923. It was the liner's first voyage on the New York – San Francisco route after an absence of eight years.]]
In contrast to her time on the North Atlantic, ''Kroonland'' encountered few weather or mechanical delays on the coast-to-coast route. In December 1923, however, the ship was delayed one day by unusually heavy seas and gales off [[Baja California]].&lt;ref name=LST-1923-12-21 /&gt; Another delay in October 1924 proved to be fatal, according to the ship's physician. An arrival two days late, caused by adverse currents north of Panama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Storms delay liners | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 17 October 1924 | page = A–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; cost a female passenger her life. Had the ship not been delayed, the physician believed, prompt hospital care could have saved her. On this same trip, ''Kroonland'' passed through a &quot;hurricane zone&quot; but was not adversely affected by the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Death victor in race with ship | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 20 October 1924 | page = 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In all probability the &quot;hurricane zone&quot; referred to the [[1924 Cuba hurricane|Cuba hurricane]] (12–23 October) of the [[1924 Atlantic hurricane season|1924 season]] that formed in the [[Caribbean Sea]] off the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] and moved across Cuba, Florida, and into the Atlantic.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1924, the Panama Pacific Line announced that it would add {{SS|Mongolia|1903|2}} to the New York – California route in February to replace ''Kroonland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Globe-circling vessel due at harbor today | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 15 December 1924 | page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though press accounts reported as late as March 1925 that ''Kroonland'' had sailed her last on the route,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Liner returns to Pacific | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 16 March 1925 | page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; she continued carrying passengers and cargo through at least June 1925 because of booming business.&lt;ref name=LAT-1925-06-16 /&gt; Although plans had been announced to convert ''Kroonland'' and ''Finland'' to freighters upon the delivery of two new ships ordered for the route in late 1924, there is no evidence that this was ever carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = New liners for Panama Pacific | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 11 November 1924 | page = A22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable passengers ===
''Kroonland'' carried her share of notable passengers during her second stint for the Panama Pacific Line. On her first voyage, passengers included American [[Modernism|Modernist]] poet [[Wallace Stevens]] and his wife, Elsie. After transiting the Panama Canal, the liner headed north along the western coast of Mexico. The ship passed the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec|Gulf]] and [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in early November, inspiring Stevens to later pen the poem &quot;Sea Surface Full Of Clouds&quot;. First published in the July 1924 issue of literary magazine ''[[The Dial]]'',&lt;ref name=Cook-80&gt;Cook, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; it was later included in the 1931 edition of Stevens' ''[[Harmonium (poetry collection)|Harmonium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the five stanzas begins with the line &quot;In that November off Tehuantepec&quot; and is a different portrayal of the surface of the sea.&lt;ref name=Cook-80 /&gt; The poem has been called one of Stevens' &quot;most persuasive statements of the imagination's powers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Litz, pp. 150–51.&lt;/ref&gt; and considered &quot;the most perfect example of a 'pure poem'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable passengers included [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] [[shortstop]] [[Ray E. French]], who sailed with his wife to their home in California on the same voyage as Stevens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Two liners carry tourists abroad | work = The New York Times | date = 18 October 1923 | page = 33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; California artist [[William Barr (artist)|William Barr]], American author [[Frederick O'Brien]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Sea route takes tourists to coast | work = The New York Times | date = 6 December 1923 | page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and actress [[Mary Carr]] all sailed on ''Kroonland'' in December 1923.&lt;ref name=LST-1923-12-21&gt;{{cite news | title = Kroonland is held back by gales at sea | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 21 December 1923 | page = I–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1924, [[Daniel Willard]], president of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], sailed from New York to Los Angeles. Acknowledging that the Panama Canal had &quot;detract[ed] volumes of freight&quot; from railroads, Willard said that there was no cause for alarm because the railroad business was booming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Liner carries notables | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 10 February 1924 | page = C–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1925, [[Gene Byrnes]], creator of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Reg'lar Fellers]]'', sailed from New York to Los Angeles with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = New motorship departs today | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 25 January 1925 | page = 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same voyage, [[University of Southern California]] president [[Rufus B. von KleinSmid]] boarded ''Kroonland'' at Panama after attending the [[Pan-American Scientific Congress]] in Lima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Dr. von KleinSmid back | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 25 January 1925 | page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-June the same year, short story author and screenwriter [[H.

== American Line service, 1925–1926 ==
[[Image:1926 Miami Hurricane damage.jpg|thumb|450px|right|''Kroonland''{{'}}s New York – Miami service was not renewed following the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]] which struck the city in September and caused widespread damage.]]
In October 1925, the American Line announced plans for the liner to sail on a weekly New York – Miami route. ''Kroonland'', supplanted {{SS|H. F. Alexander||2}}&lt;ref group=Note&gt;{{SS|H. F. Alexander||2}} was a later name for ''Great Northern'', the ship that transited the Panama Canal the same day as ''Kroonland'' back in February 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Admiral Line as the largest ship in Miami service, and sailed from [[Chelsea Piers|Pier 62]] in New York on Thursdays, arrived and departed Miami on Sundays, and returned to New York on Wednesdays. Though ''Kroonland''{{'}}s passenger capacity was potentially much larger, she was outfitted for 500 passengers in first class only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Kroonland will be put on New York – Miami route for weekly run this winter | work = The Wall Street Journal | date = 23 October 1925 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She sailed on her first voyage with 400 passengers, including American professional golfer [[Gene Sarazen]], on 10 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Miami ship service inaugurated today | work = The New York Times | date = 10 December 1925 | page = 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the seasonal service to Miami ended in late March 1926,&lt;ref name=CSM-1926-03-30&gt;{{cite news | title = In the ship lanes | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 30 March 1926 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kroonland'' had carried 11,000 passengers on the route.&lt;ref name=WSJ-1926-11-02&gt;{{cite news | title = Marine out of Miami business | work = The Wall Street Journal | date = 2 November 1926 | page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though plans were announced for the liner to resume the route the following winter,&lt;ref name=CSM-1926-03-30 /&gt; this did not happen.&lt;ref name=WSJ-1926-11-02 /&gt; IMM offered no reasons, but conditions in Miami at the end of 1926 were very different from the previous year.

The ship was later sold to shipbreakers in Italy and departed the United States for the last time on 29 January 1927. After delivering a cargo of grain to her old homeport of Antwerp, she was taken to [[Genoa]] and scrapped. According to an Associated Press report, ''Kroonland'' had completed 234 voyages totaling {{convert|1635468|nmi|km}} during the course of her career without serious accident.&lt;ref name=AP-WP&gt;{{cite news | agency = [[Associated Press]] | title = Razing of Kroonland at Genoa ordered | work = The Washington Post | date = 30 January 1927 | page = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Associated Press article did not state whether the career totals included wartime service.&lt;/ref&gt;
