'''John Cummings Howell''' (24 November 1819 – 12 September 1892) was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He rose to the rank of [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] and late in his career was commander-in-chief of the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] and then of the [[European Squadron]].

==Early life==
Howell was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], on 24 November 1819.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;&gt;Hamersly, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grave&quot;&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=83694861 Adm John C. Howell at Find-a-Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval career==

===Early career===

Howell was appointed as a [[midshipman]] on 9 June 1836.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/organization-and-administration/historical-leadership/navy-and-marine-corps-officers-1775-1900/navy-officers-1798-1900-h.html Naval History and Heritage Command: Navy Officers 1798–1900: H]&lt;/ref&gt; His first tour of duty was aboard the new [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Levant|1837|6}} in the [[West Indies Squadron (United States)|West Indies Squadron]] from 1837 to 1841. He was promoted to [[passed midshipman]] on 1 July 1842 and served aboard the new [[frigate]] {{USS|Congress|1841|6}} in the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean Squadron]] from 1842 to 1844. From 1844 to 1845 he served aboard the [[brig]] {{USS|Perry|1843|6}} in the [[East India Squadron]], after which he was Naval [[Storekeeper]] at [[Macao]] from 1846 to 1848.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;

Promoted to [[Master (naval)|master]] on 21 February 1849&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;/&gt; and to [[lieutenant]] on 2 August 1849,&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;/&gt; Howell returned to sea for a tour aboard the frigate {{USS|Raritan|1843|6}} in the [[Home Squadron]] from 1849 to 1850. He next served aboard the sloop-of-war {{USS|Saratoga|1842|6}} in the East India Squadron from 1851 to 1853. A tour aboard the [[receiving ship]] at Philadelphia followed from 1854 to 1856, after which he returned to the Mediterranean Squadron to serve aboard the steam frigate {{USS|Susquehanna|1850|6}} from 1856 to 1858. Then he had a second tour aboard the receiving ship at Philadelphia &amp;ndash; which by then was {{USS|Princeton|1851|6}} &amp;ndash; from 1859 to 1860. &lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;

===American Civil War===

The [[American Civil War]] broke out in April 1861, and that year Howell reported aboard the steam frigate {{USS|Minnesota|1855|6}}, which was assigned to the [[North Atlantic Blockading Squadron]] to take part in the [[Union blockade]] of the [[Confederate States of America]]. While aboard ''Minnesota'' he saw action in the [[Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries]] on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] on 28-29 August 1861.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;

Howell detached from ''Minnesota'' later in 1861 to become the first [[commanding officer]] of the new [[gunboat]] {{USS|Tahoma|1861|6}}, which was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 20 December 1861 and assigned to the [[East Gulf Blockading Squadron]], with which she remained throughout her career.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFSTahoma&quot;&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/tahoma-i.html ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'': Tahoma]&lt;/ref&gt; Under his command, ''Tahoma'' enjoyed many successes. On 26 April 1862, she chased a Confederate [[schooner]] until it ran aground, then destroyed it. In June 1862, she raided [[St. Mark's, Florida|St. Mark's]], [[Florida]], where she burned a barracks and destroyed a [[Artillery battery|battery]] of Confederate [[artillery]]. Off [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatán Peninsula]], she captured the [[blockade runner]] ''Uncle Mose'', a schooner carrying 115 bales of [[cotton]], after ''Uncle Mose'' mistakenly sailed up to her on 7 July 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFSTahoma&quot;/&gt; Nine days later, Howell was promoted to [[Commander (United States)|commander]] on 16 July 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;/&gt;

''Tahoma'' joined the gunboat {{USS|Somerset|1862|6}} in putting 111 men ashore in eight boats at [[Seahorse Key]] to destroy three Confederate [[salt]] works on 6 October 1862. She went on to capture the [[sloop]] ''Silas Henry'', which was running the blockade with a cargo of cotton, at [[Tampa Bay]], Florida, on 8 January 1863; the British schooner ''Margaret'' off [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St, Petersburg]], Florida, on 1 February 1863; and the [[yacht]] ''Stonewall'' off [[Pea Creek]], Florida, on 22 February 1863. She exchanged fire with a Confederate shore battery at [[Gadsden's Point]], Florida, on 2 April 1863, and then returned to her pursuit of blockade runners, capturing the schooner ''Crazy Jane'', carrying a cargo of cotton and [[turpentine]], near Gadsden's point on 5 May 1863 and the schooner ''Statesman'' and her cargo of cotton in Tampa Bay on 6 June 1863. On 18 June 1863, she both captured the British schooner ''Harrietton'' off [[Anclote Key]] and destroyed the blockade runner ''Mary Jane'' at [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]], Florida. On 17 October 1863, she joined the gunboat {{USS|Adela}} in landing an expeditionary force at [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], Florida, and burned the steamer ''Scottish Chief'' and the sloop ''Kate Dale''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFSTahoma&quot;/&gt; Howell detached from ''Tahoma'' later in 1863.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;

Howell's next tour was as the first commanding officer of the schooner-rigged steamer {{USS|Nereus|1863|6}}, which was commissioned on 19 April 1864 and assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Under his command, ''Nereus'' escorted the steamer SS ''North Star'' from [[New York City]] to [[Aspinwall, Panama|Aspinwall]], [[Colombia]], on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], and the [[Monitor (ship)|monitor]] {{USS|Dictator|1863|6}} on a voyage from New York City to [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]]; towed the monitor {{USS|Saugus|1863|6}} from [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], Virginia, to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], [[North Carolina]], for operations against Confederate [[Fort Fisher]]; and took part in the [[First Battle of Fort Fisher]] of 23-27 December 1864 and the [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher]] of 13-15 January 1865. She then towed the monitor {{USS|Mahopac|1863|6}} from Wilmington to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]], for operations against the Confederate defenses of [[Charleston Harbor]]. Howell and ''Nereus'' ended the war searching the [[Bahamas]] and the [[Caribbean]] for the [[Confederate States Navy]] [[commerce raider]] [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/n/nereus-i.html ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'': Nereus]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Civil War===

Promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] on 25 July 1866,&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;/&gt; Howell's first post-war tour was as commanding officer of the Naval Rendezvous at Philadelphia from 1866 to 1868. He returned to sea in 1869 as a member of the staff of the [[European Squadron]], serving as the squadron's fleet captain from 1869 to 1870 and as chief of staff to its commander-in-chief, Rear Admiral [[Charles S. Boggs]], in 1871. He commanded [[League Island Navy Yard]] in Philadelphia from 1871 to 1872.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt; Promoted to [[Commodore (United States)|commodore]] on 29 January 1872,&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;/&gt; he commanded the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]] in [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery]], [[Maine]], from 1872 to 1874&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt; and was the chief of the U.S. Navy's [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] from 22 September 1874&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;/&gt; to 1878.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rentfrow35&quot;&gt;Rentfrow, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to rear admiral during this tour on 25 April 1877.&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;/&gt;

In September 1878, Howell became commander-in-chief of the [[North Atlantic Squadron]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rentfrow35&quot;/&gt; with the steam frigate {{USS|Powhatan|1850|6}} as his [[flagship]]. The squadron was considered the most prestigious seagoing command in the U.S. Navy at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Rentfrow, pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; but the Navy had shrunk so dramatically since the conclusion of the Civil War in April 1865 that the squadron consisted of only two ships, ''Powhatan'' and the screw sloop-of-war {{USS|Plymouth|1867|6}}, during his tenure as its commander-in-chief. When an insurrection broke out on the Caribbean island of Santa Cruz in the [[Danish Virgin Islands]] (now [[St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands]]), the [[United States Department of the Navy]] ordered Howell to intervene with his squadron. Unfortunately, ''Powhatan'' was in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Postmouth]], [[New Hampshire]], and too far away from Santa Cruz to influence events there, and ''Plymouth'' was not provisioned and unable to get underway. A [[French Navy]] warship got to Santa Cruz first, landed troops, and quelled the rioting there, but not before the rioters had burned the American [[consulate]]. Despite the limited means at Howell's disposal &amp;ndash; a squadron consisting of only two ships with which to carry out the responsibility for all U.S. Navy operations off eastern [[Canada]], along the entire [[United States East Coast]] and [[United States Gulf Coast]], and in the entire [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] &amp;ndash; the Department of the Navy reprimanded him for having neither of his ships ready to deploy to Santa Cruz on short notice and in a timely manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;rentfrow35&quot;/&gt;

In January 1879, Howell turned command of the North Atlantic Squadron over to Rear Admiral [[Robert H. Wyman]]. He became commander-in-chief of the European Squadron&lt;ref name=&quot;rentfrow35&quot;/&gt; in February 1879, serving in that capacity until relieved by Rear Admiral [[James W. Nicholson]] on 16 September 1881. He retired from the Navy upon reaching the statutory retirement age of 62 on 24 November 1881.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamersly29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;/&gt;

==Death==

Howell died in the [[United Kingdom]] at [[Folkestone]], [[Kent]], [[England]], on 12 September 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;grave&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;officers&quot;/&gt; He is buried at Cheriton Road Cemetery in Folkestone.&lt;ref name=&quot;grave&quot;/&gt;
