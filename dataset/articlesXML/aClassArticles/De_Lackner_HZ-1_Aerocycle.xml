The '''HZ-1 Aerocycle''', also known as the '''YHO-2''' and by the manufacturer's designation '''DH-4 Heli-Vector''', was an American one-man &quot;personal [[helicopter]]&quot; developed by [[de Lackner Helicopters]] in the mid-1950s. Intended to be operated by inexperienced pilots with a minimum of 20 minutes of instruction,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qsgcX3mC0k&amp;sig=5uzq7dFzwBL4NlAn6jl810wzujk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DPAdUMLcFabRyAGC94D4CQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%20Science%20installing%20linoleum&amp;f=true &quot;Aerocycle Lifts Soldier&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1956, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  the HZ-1 was expected to become a standard [[reconnaissance]] machine with the [[United States Army]]. Although early testing showed that the craft had promise for providing mobility on the [[Nuclear warfare|atomic battlefield]], more extensive evaluation proved that the aircraft was in fact too difficult to control for operation by untrained [[infantrymen]], and after a pair of crashes the project was abandoned. A single model of the craft was put on display.

== Design and development ==
During the early 1950s, [[Charles H. Zimmerman]] of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) developed a system for control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted on the underside of the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight,&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt; and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAM&quot;/&gt; Known as [[kinesthetic control]], and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a [[surfboard]],&lt;ref name=&quot;HAM&quot;&gt;Hiller Aviation Museum&lt;/ref&gt; it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time.&lt;ref name=&quot;VectorSite&quot;/&gt; NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including [[Bensen Aircraft]], [[Hiller Aircraft]], and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt;

The concept proposed by de Lackner Helicopters was a one-man flying platform, and it received the company designation &quot;DH-4&quot;. The DH-4 was expected to be able to carry up to {{convert|120|lb|kg}} of cargo&lt;ref name=&quot;VectorSite&quot;&gt;Goebel 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or an auxiliary {{convert|5|usgal|adj=on}} fuel tank to extend its range up to {{convert|50|mi|km}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Mechanix&quot;&gt;''Mechanix Illustrated'' 1955&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to its pilot; in addition, a cargo lifting line could be threaded through the rotor shaft for the carrying of [[slung load]]s underneath the craft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mechanix&quot;/&gt;

The machine was a simple, cross-shaped frame, with the pilot standing on a platform, secured by a [[safety harness]]. The harness also secured the aircraft's engine, which was an [[outboard motor]] manufactured by [[Mercury Marine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mechanix&quot;/&gt; The engine was controlled by a [[twist-grip]] motorcycle-style throttle&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight&quot;/&gt; and transferred power to the {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter, contra-rotating rotors via belt drive&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt; with a chain reduction unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;AH&quot;&gt;Champlin 1953&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft's landing gear consisted of airbags at the end of each arm of the frame along with a large rubber float in the middle, allowing for amphibious capability,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mechanix&quot;/&gt; although this arrangement was later replaced by a pair of conventional helicopter-type skids.&lt;ref name=Harding&gt;Harding 1997, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing ==
[[File:De Lackner HZ-1 test flown by Captain Sundby.png|thumb|right|Captain Sundby test-flies the HZ-1|alt=An Army officer in khakis and cap stands aboard a strange flying machine with twin rotors beneath his feet, running up on the ground, performing pre-flight checks.]]

Originally designated YHO-2 by the U.S. Army, then later re-designated HZ-1 and named &quot;Aerocycle&quot;, the prototype made its first tethered flight on 22 November 1954,&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot;&gt;''The Aeroplane'', v. 88, 1955. p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; with its first free flight taking place in January 1955 at the [[Brooklyn Army Terminal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt; Over 160 flights totaling more than 15 hours of flight time were conducted,&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot;/&gt; and the results of this early test flight program were considered promising enough that a dozen examples of the type were ordered&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt; (serial numbers 56-6928 to 56-6939).&lt;ref&gt;Heyman and Parsch 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Predictions were made that the craft could provide transport to a modern version of the old horse [[cavalry]], providing airborne &quot;eyes and ears&quot; for the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Corn and Horrigan 1996, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the test program was transferred to [[Joint Base Langleyâ€“Eustis|Fort Eustis]], [[Virginia]], where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt; The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight&quot;&gt;''Flight and Aircraft Engineer'', 2 November 1956, p. 724.&lt;/ref&gt; and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required.&lt;ref&gt;''The AOPA Pilot'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=UlcPAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22DH-4%22+Heli-Vector&amp;dq=%22DH-4%22+Heli-Vector&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x7v-S7bhNcX7lwfDq8jhCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA v. 15], 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt; Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was much more difficult to fly than had been expected,&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;&gt;U.S. Army Transportation Museum&lt;/ref&gt; and would not be safe in the hands of an inexperienced pilot.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt; In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.&lt;ref name=&quot;VectorSite&quot;/&gt;

Over a series of tethered and free-flying test flights lasting up to 43 minutes, the HZ-1 suffered a pair of accidents. Both crashes occurred under similar conditions â€“ the contra-rotating rotors intermeshed and collided, the blades shattering, causing an immediate loss of control resulting in a crash.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt; Aerodynamic testing was conducted in the full-scale [[wind tunnel]] at the [[Langley Research Center]], and it was discovered that the Aerocycle's forwards speed was limited by an uncontrollable pitching motion, but rotor-tip clearance was always sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman 1997, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The inability to determine the precise cause of the intermeshing, combined with the fact that the &quot;personal lifting device&quot; concept was failing to live up to its expectations, led to the decision to terminate the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt;

Sundby was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his test-flying work with the HZ-1,&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt; going on to test-fly the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] and [[Sikorsky H-34|H-34]] helicopters, as well as seeing combat in the [[Vietnam War]] before retiring with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armyavnmuseum.org/people/p2z/colsundbys.html &quot;Selmer A. Sundby&quot;]. U.S. Army Aviation Museum website. Accessed 27 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parachute development ===
[[File:HZ-1 Aerocycle following crash.png|thumb|right|A HZ-1 following a crash|alt=The shattered remains of a small helicopter-like craft lay on their side on the ground following an accident.]]

An entirely new type of [[parachute]] with extremely fast opening characteristics, the &quot;Ultra-Fast Opening Personnel Parachute Type XMP-2&quot;, was developed for use in testing of the HZ-1 and [[Hiller VZ-1 Pawnee|Hiller VZ-1]] flying platforms. Designed for use from {{convert|0|to-|50|mph|km/h}} and at altitudes as low as {{convert|25|ft|m}}, the XMP-2 proved to have insufficient reliability for use as a personnel parachute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0256874 &quot;Ultra-fast Opening Personnel Parachute Type XMP-2&quot;]. Defense Technical Information Center. Accessed 27 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aircraft on display ==
Of the dozen examples of the type ordered by the U.S. Army, only a single example of the HZ-1 has survived, and this aircraft is currently on display in the [[U.S. Army Transportation Museum]] at Fort Eustis, [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA&quot;/&gt;
