'''Glenn Theodore Seaborg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|b|ɔr|g}}; April 19, 1912{{spaced ndash}}February 25, 1999) was an American chemist whose involvement in the [[Synthetic element|synthesis]], discovery and investigation of ten [[transuranium element]]s earned him a share of the 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel Prize&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1951 |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1951/index.html |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in this area also led to his development of the [[actinide concept]] and the arrangement of the [[actinide]] series in the [[Periodic table|periodic table of the elements]].

Seaborg spent most of his career as an educator and research scientist at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], serving as a professor, and, between 1958 and 1961, as the university's second chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellors |title=Past Chancellors &amp;#124; Office of the Chancellor |publisher=Chancellor.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advised ten [[Presidents of the United States|US Presidents]]{{spaced ndash}}from [[Harry S. Truman]] to [[Bill Clinton]]{{spaced ndash}}on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the [[Franck Report]] and contributed to the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]], the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the [[Eisenhower administration]], he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]], he was a key contributor to its 1983 report &quot;[[A Nation at Risk]]&quot;.

Seaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: [[plutonium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], [[californium]], [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[mendelevium]], [[nobelium]] and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named [[seaborgium]] in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 atomic [[isotope]]s and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the [[Fat Man|second atomic bomb]]. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in [[nuclear medicine]] and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, most notably [[iodine-131]], which is used in the treatment of [[thyroid]] disease. In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the [[lanthanide]] series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the [[transactinide]] and [[superactinide]] series.

After sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with [[Edwin McMillan]], he received approximately 50 honorary doctorates and numerous other [[Glenn T. Seaborg (awards and honors)|awards and honors]]. The [[list of things named after Glenn T. Seaborg|list of things named after Seaborg]] ranges from his atomic element to an asteroid. He was a [[Glenn T. Seaborg (Publications)|prolific author]], penning numerous books and 500 journal articles, often in collaboration with others. He  was once listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the person with the longest entry in ''[[Who's Who in America]]''.

==Early life==
Glenn Theodore Seaborg was born in [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], on April 19, 1912, the son of Herman Theodore (Ted) and Selma Olivia Erickson Seaborg. He had one sister, Jeanette, who was two years younger. His family spoke Swedish at home. When Glenn Seaborg was a boy, the family moved to [[Los Angeles County, California]], settling in a subdivision called [[Seaborg Home (South Gate, California)|Home Gardens]], later annexed to the City of [[South Gate, California]]. About this time he changed the spelling of his first name from &lt;nowiki&gt;'Glen'&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &quot;Glenn&quot;.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }}

Seaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 until he suffered a stroke in 1998.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=336 }} As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged him to become a bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at [[Jordan High School (Los Angeles, California)|David Starr Jordan High School]] in [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]].{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=13–14}}

Seaborg graduated from Jordan in 1929 at the top of his class and received a bachelor  of arts (AB) degree in chemistry at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], in 1933.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }} He worked his way through school as a stevedore and a laboratory assistant at [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]].{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=15, 29}} Seaborg took his PhD in chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1937 with a doctoral thesis on the &quot;Interaction of Fast Neutrons with Lead&quot;,{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=40}} in which he coined the term &quot;nuclear [[spallation]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argonne&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dep.anl.gov/postdocs/seaborg_bio.htm |title=Scientific and Luminary Biography - Glenn Seaborg |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |accessdate=June 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seaborg was a member of the professional chemistry fraternity [[Alpha Chi Sigma]]. As a graduate student in the 1930s Seaborg performed [[wet chemistry]] research for his advisor [[Gilbert Newton Lewis]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Argonne&quot;/&gt; and published three papers with him on the theory of [[acid]]s and [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Primary and secondary acids and bases |first=G.

For several years, Seaborg conducted important research in artificial [[radioactivity]] using the Lawrence [[cyclotron]] at UC Berkeley.  He was excited to learn from others that [[nuclear fission]] was possible—but also chagrined, as his own research might have led him to the same discovery.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=57–59}}

Seaborg also became an expert in dealing with noted Berkeley physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation, and often answered a junior man's question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=26}}

==Pioneering work in nuclear chemistry==
[[File:Seaborg in lab.jpeg|thumb|right|Seaborg in his lab]]
Seaborg remained at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed [[Frederick Soddy]]'s work investigating [[isotope]]s and contributed to the discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, [[John Livingood]], Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, [[iron-59]] (Fe-59) in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the [[hemoglobin]] in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of [[iodine]], [[iodine-131]] (I-131), which is still used to treat [[thyroid]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg's mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; University of California, Berkeley, physicist [[Edwin McMillan]] led a team that discovered element 93, which he named [[neptunium]] in 1940. In November, he was persuaded to leave Berkeley temporarily to assist with urgent research in [[radar]] technology. Since Seaborg and his colleagues had perfected McMillan's oxidation-reduction technique for isolating neptunium, he asked McMillan for permission to continue the research and search for element 94. McMillan agreed to the collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seaborg first reported [[alpha decay]] proportionate to only a fraction of the element 93 under observation. The first hypothesis for this [[alpha particle]] accumulation was contamination by uranium, which produces alpha-decay particles; analysis of alpha-decay particles ruled this out. Seaborg then postulated that a distinct alpha-producing element was being formed from element 93.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Elementary Problem&quot;/&gt;

In February 1941, Seaborg and his collaborators produced [[plutonium-239]] through the bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with [[deuteron]]s, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93. But it then underwent beta-decay, forming a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Plutonium is fairly stable, but undergoes alpha-decay, which explained the presence of alpha particles coming from neptunium.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Elementary Problem&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, on March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist [[Emilio Segrè]] and Berkeley chemist [[Joseph W. Kennedy]] were able to show that [[plutonium]] (then known only as element 94) was [[fissile]], an important distinction that was crucial to the decisions made in directing [[Manhattan Project]] research.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=77–79}} In 1966, Room 307 of [[Gilman Hall]] on the campus at the Berkeley, where Seaborg did his work, was declared a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lbl.gov/Publications/Seaborg/Gilman.htm |title=Nuclear Milestones: 307 Gilman Hall |first=Glenn T. |last=Seaborg |publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] |accessdate=June 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to plutonium, he is credited as a lead discoverer of [[americium]], [[curium]], and [[berkelium]], and as a co-discoverer of [[californium]], [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[mendelevium]], [[nobelium]] and [[seaborgium]]. He shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1951 with Edwin McMillan for &quot;their discoveries in the chemistry of the first transuranium elements.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel Prize&quot;/&gt;

==Scientific contributions during the Manhattan Project==
On April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago and joined the chemistry group at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] of the Manhattan Project at the [[University of Chicago]], where [[Enrico Fermi]] and his group would later convert [[uranium-238]] to plutonium-239 in a controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Seaborg's role was to figure out how to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of [[uranium]]. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the [[Clinton Engineering Works]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and then entered full-scale production at the [[Hanford Engineer Works]], in [[Richland, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seaborg's theoretical development of the [[actinide concept]] resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the [[actinide series]] appearing below the [[lanthanide series]]. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household [[smoke detectors]] and thus provided a good source of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the [[Franck Report]] (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=320, 340–43, 348, 354, 369, 377, 395}}

==Professor and Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley==
[[File:NNSA-NSO-403.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg (second from left) during [[Operation Plumbob]]]]
After the conclusion of World War II and the Manhattan Project, Seaborg was eager to return to academic life and university research free from the restrictions of wartime secrecy. In 1946, he added to his responsibilities as a professor by heading the nuclear chemistry research at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory operated by the University of California on behalf of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Seaborg was named one of the &quot;Ten Outstanding Young Men in America&quot; by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1947 (along with [[Richard Nixon]] and others). Seaborg was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1948. From 1954 to 1961 he served as associate director of the radiation laboratory. He was appointed by President Truman to serve as a member of the General Advisory Committee of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], an assignment he retained until 1960.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|pp=333-334 }}

Seaborg served as [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1961. His term coincided with a relaxation of [[McCarthy-era]] restrictions on students' freedom of expression that had begun under his predecessor, [[Clark Kerr]].{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=174–179}} In October 1958, Seaborg announced that the University had relaxed its prior prohibitions on political activity on a trial basis,&lt;ref&gt;

Seaborg was an enthusiastic supporter of Cal's sports teams. San Francisco columnist [[Herb Caen]] was fond of pointing out that Seaborg's surname is an anagram of &quot;Go Bears&quot;, a popular cheer at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seaborg was proud of the fact that the [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|Cal Bears]] won their first and only [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) basketball championship in 1959, while he was chancellor. The [[California Golden Bears football|football team]] also won the conference title and played in the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;sports&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/seaborg-sports-life.html |title=Glenn Seaborg: A Sporting Life |last=Yarris |first=Lynn |date=March 5, 1999 |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |accessdate=June 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the Faculty Athletic Committee for several years and was the co-author of a book, ''Roses from the Ashes: Breakup and Rebirth in Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Athletics'' (2000), concerning the [[Pacific Coast Conference]] recruiting scandal, and the founding of what is now the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]], in which he played a role in restoring confidence in the integrity of collegiate sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;sports&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/sea0bio-1 |title=Glenn Seaborg Biography |publisher=[[Academy of Achievement]] |accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seaborg served on the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]] (PSAC)  during the [[Eisenhower administration]]. PSAC produced a report on &quot;Scientific Progress, the Universities, and the Federal Government&quot;, also known as the &quot;Seaborg Report&quot;, in November 1960, that urged greater federal funding of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lbl.gov/Publications/Seaborg/NatService.htm |title=National Service |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory |accessdate=July 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, he helped found the Berkeley [[Space Sciences Laboratory]] with Clark Kerr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/about/history/ |title=Space Sciences Laboratory |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=June 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission==
After appointment by President [[John F. Kennedy]] and confirmation by the [[United States Senate]], Seaborg was chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) from 1961 to 1971. His pending appointment by [[President-elect]] Kennedy was nearly derailed in late 1960 when members of the Kennedy transition team learned that Seaborg had been listed in a ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' article as a member of &quot;Nixon's Idea Men&quot;. Seaborg said that as a lifetime [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] he was baffled when the article appeared associating him with outgoing Vice President Richard Nixon, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] whom Seaborg considered a casual acquaintance.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=181}}

[[Image:Seaborg kennedy.jpg|thumb|left|President Kennedy and his Atomic Energy Commission Chairman, Glenn Seaborg]]
While chairman of the AEC, Seaborg participated on the negotiating team for the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] (LTBT), in which the US, UK, and [[USSR]] agreed to ban all above-ground test detonations of nuclear weapons. Seaborg considered his contributions to the achievement of the LTBT as one of his greatest accomplishments. Despite strict rules from the Soviets about photography at the signing ceremony, Seaborg snuck a tiny camera past the Soviet guards to take a close-up photograph of Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] as he signed the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;!--
Seaborg was ardent supporter of large scale massive nuclear plants for electricity generation despite concerns by industry insiders that such large plants were vulnerable in that their nuclear cores could not be properly contained in the event of an accident or operating emergency. Seaborg received a letter dated August 16, 1966, from industry engineers expressing these concerns at the time of the licensing of New York's Indian Point reactor. This letter advised Seaborg and other AEC senior members of these containment concerns which would later become known as the &quot;China Syndrome&quot; resulting from uncontained core meltdowns. Seaborg directed this letter not be released to the public as he feared it would be misunderstood and therefore damage the nuclear industry in the public's view, even though the law required such letters be released for public disclosure. This disclosure first came to light for public view in the BBC documentary series, &quot;Pandora's Box, A Is For Atom&quot; dealing with the early history of commercial nuclear development. --&gt;

Seaborg enjoyed a close relationship with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] and influenced the administration to pursue the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=200-206}} Seaborg was called to the White House in the first week of the Nixon Administration in January 1969 to advise President Richard Nixon on his first diplomatic crisis involving the Soviets and nuclear testing. He clashed with Nixon presidential adviser [[John Ehrlichman]] over the treatment of a Jewish scientist, [[Zalman Shapiro]], whom the Nixon administration suspected of leaking nuclear secrets to Israel.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=218-221}}

Seaborg published several books and journal articles during his tenure at the Atomic Energy Commission. He predicted the existence of elements beyond those on the periodic table,&lt;ref&gt;

While most of these theoretical future elements have extremely short half-lives and thus no expected practical applications, he also hypothesized the existence of stable super-heavy isotopes of certain elements in an [[island of stability]].&lt;ref&gt;

Following his service as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Seaborg returned to UC Berkeley where he was awarded the position of University Professor. At the time, there had been fewer University Professors at UC Berkeley than Nobel Prize winners. He also served as Chairman of the Lawrence Hall of Science where he became the principal investigator for Great Explorations in Math and Science (GEMS)&lt;ref&gt;

In 1980, he [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] several thousand [[atom]]s of [[bismuth]] into gold at the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]]. His experimental technique, using [[nuclear physics]], was able to remove [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s from the bismuth atoms. Seaborg's technique would have been far too expensive to enable routine manufacturing of gold, but his work was close to the mythical [[Philosopher's Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;

Seaborg lived most of his later life in [[Lafayette, California]], where he devoted himself to editing and publishing the journals that documented both his early life and later career. He rallied a group of scientists who criticized the science curriculum in the state of California, which he viewed as far too socially oriented and not nearly focused enough on hard science. California Governor [[Pete Wilson]] appointed Seaborg to head a committee that proposed changes to California's science curriculum despite outcries from labor organizations and others.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=193-194}}

==Personal life==
In 1942, Seaborg married [[Helen L. Seaborg|Helen Griggs]], the secretary of physicist [[Ernest Lawrence]]. Under wartime pressure, Seaborg had moved to Chicago while engaged to Griggs. When Seaborg returned to accompany Griggs for the journey back to Chicago, friends expected them to marry in Chicago. But, eager to be married, Seaborg and Griggs impulsively got off the train in the town of [[Caliente, Nevada]], for what they thought would be a quick wedding. When they asked for City Hall, they found Caliente had none—they would have to travel {{convert|25|mi}} north to [[Pioche, Nevada|Pioche]], the [[county seat]]. With no car, this was no easy feat, but one of Caliente's newest deputy sheriffs turned out to be a recent graduate of the Cal Berkeley chemistry department and was more than happy to do a favor for Seaborg. The deputy sheriff arranged for the wedding couple to ride up and back to Pioche in a mail truck. The witnesses at the Seaborg wedding were a clerk and a janitor.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=79-85}} Glenn Seaborg and Helen Griggs Seaborg had six children, of whom the first, Peter Glenn Seaborg, died in 1997. The others were Lynne Seaborg Cobb, [[David Seaborg]], Steve Seaborg, Eric Seaborg, and Dianne Seaborg.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=332 }}

Seaborg was an avid hiker. Upon becoming Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1961, he commenced taking daily hikes through a trail that he blazed at the headquarters site in [[Germantown, Maryland]]. He frequently invited colleagues and visitors to accompany him, and the trail became known as the &quot;Glenn Seaborg Trail.&quot; He and his wife Helen are credited with blazing a {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=on}} trail in the East Bay area near their home in Lafayette, California. This trail has since become a part of the American Hiking Association's cross-country network of trails. Seaborg and his wife walked the trail network from [[Contra Costa County]] all the way to the California–Nevada border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.energy.gov/bes/about/bes-organizational-history/germantown-natural-history/glenn-seaborg-trail/ |title=Glenn Seaborg Trail |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] |accessdate=June 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=335 }}

Seaborg kept a close bond to his Swedish origin. He visited Sweden every so often, and his family were members of the Swedish ''Pemer Genealogical Society'', a family association open for every descendant of the Pemer family, a Swedish family with German origin, from which Seaborg was descended on his mother's side.&lt;ref&gt;

During his lifetime, Seaborg is said to have been the author or co-author of numerous  books and 500 scientific journal articles, many of them brief reports on fast-breaking discoveries in nuclear science while other subjects, most notably the actinide concept, represented major theoretical contributions in the [[history of science]]. He held more than 40 patents – among them the only patents ever issued for chemical elements, americium and curium, and received more than 50 doctorates and honorary degrees in his lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seaborgium&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=LBL Research Review |issn=0882-1305 |date=August 1994 |title=Seaborgium: Element 106 Named in Honor of Glenn T.
