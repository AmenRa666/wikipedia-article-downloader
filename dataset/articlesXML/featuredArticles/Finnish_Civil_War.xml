The '''Finnish Civil War''' (27 January – 15 May 1918) concerned leadership and control of [[Finland]] during the transition from a [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]] of the [[Russian Empire]] to an independent state. The conflict formed a part of [[Aftermath of World War I|the national, political, and social turmoil]] caused by [[World War I]] ([[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]) in [[Europe]]. The war was fought between the ''Reds'', led by the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] and the ''Whites'', conducted by the non-socialist, [[conservatism|conservative]]-led [[Senate of Finland|senate]]. The [[paramilitary]] [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]], composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centers of southern [[Finland]]. The paramilitary [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]], composed of peasants and middle-class and upper-class factions, controlled rural central and northern Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980b|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Payne|2011|pp=25–32}}, {{Harvnb|Tepora|Roselius|2014a|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finnish society had experienced rapid population growth, [[industrialization]], pre-urbanization and the rise of a comprehensive [[labor movement]]. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of [[democratization]] and modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle, militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish labor movement and the Finnish conservatives.

The Reds carried out an unsuccessful general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by [[Soviet Russia]]. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by an [[Imperial German Army]] squad in April. The decisive military actions of the war were the Battles of [[Tampere]] and [[Viipuri]], won by the Whites, and the Battles of [[Helsinki]] and [[Lahti]], won by German troops, leading to overall victory of the Whites and the German forces. Both the Reds and Whites engaged in [[terrorism|political terror]]. A large number of Reds perished due to malnutrition and disease in [[Finnish Civil War prison camps|prison camps]]. Altogether, around 39,000 people died in the war, including 36,000 Finns - out of a population of 3,000,000.

In the aftermath, the Finns passed from Russian government to the [[German Empire|German]] sphere of power. The Finnish  conservatives tried to establish a [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Finnish monarchy]], but the plan was aborted by the defeat of [[Germany]] in World War I. Finland emerged as an independent, democratic republic. The war divided the nation for many years and remains one of the most emotionally charged events in Finnish history. The society was reunited through social compromises based on a long-term culture of moderate politics and religion, the outcome of World War I and the postwar economic recovery.&lt;ref&gt;The 1918 War has been called by a number of names: the Civil War (domestic war with foreign influence), the Freedom War, the Brethren War, the Revolution, the Class War, the Red Rebellion, the Citizens'/Civil War, {{Harvnb|Tepora|Roselius|2014b|pp=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The main factor behind the Finnish Civil War was World War I; the [[Russian Empire]] collapsed under the pressures of the war, leading to the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s in 1917. The breakdown caused a large [[power vacuum]] and subsequent power struggle in [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], a part of the Russian Empire since 1809, became embroiled in the struggle for power. [[Geopolitically]] less important than Russia proper [[Moscow]]-[[Warsaw]] gateway, the Finnish ground was a peaceful sidefront until early 1918, but the war between the [[German Empire]] and Russia had indirect effects on the [[Finns]]. Since the end of 19th century, the Grand Duchy had become a vital source of [[raw materials]], industrial products, food and labor for the growing Imperial Russian capital [[Petrograd]] ([[Saint Petersburg]]), and World War I emphasized the role. Strategically, the Finnish territory was the northern section of the Estonian–Finnish gateway and buffer zone to and from Petrograd via the [[Gulf of Finland]], the [[Narva]] area and the [[Karelian Isthmus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=62–144}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=11–13, 152–156}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=483–524}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2012|pp=7–47}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Empire saw Eastern Europe - primarily Russia - as a major source of vital products and raw materials, both during World War I and in the future. Her resources overstretched by the two-front war, Germany pursued a policy of breaking up Russia from within by providing financial support to revolutionary groups such as the [[Bolsheviks]], [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]] (SRs) and separatist factions such as the Finnish Activists leaning toward [[Pan-Germanism|Germanism]]. Between 30 and 40 million marks were spent on this endeavor. Controlling the Finnish area would allow the [[Imperial German Army]] to penetrate Petrograd and the [[Kola Peninsula]], an area rich in raw materials for the mining industry. Finland possessed large ore reserves and a well-developed forest industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=62–144}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=11–13, 152–156}}, {{Harvnb|Pipes|1996|pp=113–149}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=483–524}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000|pp=54–64}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2009|pp=48–57}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2012|pp=7–47}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}, {{Harvnb|Hentilä|Hentilä|2016|pp=15–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1809 to 1898, a period called ''Pax Russica'', the peripheral power of the Finns gradually increased, and the Russian-Finnish relations were exceptionally peaceful compared with other parts of the Russian Empire. Russia's defeat in the [[Crimean War]] in the 1850s led to attempts to speed up the modernization of the country. This caused more than 50 years of economic, industrial, cultural and educational progress in the Grand Duchy of Finland, including improvement in the status of the [[Finnish language]]. All this encouraged Finnish nationalism and cultural unity through the birth of the [[Fennomania|Fennoman movement]], which bound the Finns to the domestic governmental system and led to the idea that the Finnish Grand Duchy was an increasingly autonomous state of the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=13–15, 30–32}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=110–114, 150–196}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=49–73}},  {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000}}, {{Harvnb|Jutikkala|Pirinen|2003|p=397}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=81–148, 264–282}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2010|pp=108–165}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, the Russian Empire initiated a policy of integration through the [[Russification of Finland]]. The strengthened, [[Pan-Slavism|pan-slavist]] central power tried to unite the &quot;Russian Multinational Dynastic Union&quot;, because the military and strategic situation of Russia became more difficult due of the rise of Germany and [[Japan]]. The Finns called the increased military and [[Administration (government)|administrative]] control &quot;the First Period of Oppression, 1899–1905&quot;, and plans for disengagement from Russia or sovereignty for Finland were drawn up for the first time. In the power struggle, the most radical political group opposing Russia, the Activist movement, included terrorist factions from the working class and the [[Swedish language|Swedish-speaking]] intelligentsia. During World War I and the rise of Germanism, the [[Svecoman movement|Svecomans]] began their [[Finnish Jäger troops|covert collaboration]] with Imperial Germany, and from 1915 to 1917, a [[Finnish Jäger troops|Finnish &quot;Jäger&quot; ''(Jääkärit)'']] battalion consisting of 1900 volunteers were trained in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=483–524}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentilä|Nevakivi|1999|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000|pp=13–85}}, {{Harvnb|Jutikkala|Pirinen|2003|pp=397}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=81–150, 264–282}}, {{Harvnb|Soikkanen|2008|pp=45–94}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2009|pp=48–57}}, {{Harvnb|Ahlbäck|2014|pp=254–293}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2014|pp=216–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
The major reasons for rising political tensions among the Finns were the autocratic rule of the Russian [[Czar]] and the undemocratic class system of the [[estates of the realm]]. The system originated in the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish Empire regime]], preceding the Russian power, and divided the Finnish people into two groups, separated economically, socially and politically. Finland's population grew rapidly in the 19th century (from 860,000 in 1810 to 3,130,000 in 1917), and a class of industrial and agrarian workers and property-less peasants emerged. The [[Industrial Revolution]] was rapid in Finland, though it started later than in the rest of [[Western Europe]]. Industrialization was financed by the state, and some of the social problems associated with the industrial process were diminished via control of the administration. Among urban workers, socioeconomic problems steepened during periods of industrial depression. The position of rural workers had worsened since the end of the 19th century, as farming became more efficient and market-oriented and the gradually developing industry did not fully utilize the rapid population growth of the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;For centuries, the geographical ground of the Finns had been the firm part of [[Sweden]]'s development to the major Nordic Empire. With the exception of language, the culture of the people did not differ markedly between the western and eastern part of Sweden, dominated by the Swedish administration-establishment and the common Lutheran Church (eventually the Finnish area bilingual), {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=29–35, 40–51}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=49–69, 90–97}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15–30}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31–44}}, {{Harvnb|Engman|2009|pp=9–43}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between Scandinavian-Finnish ([[Finno-Ugric peoples]]) and Russian-[[Slavic people|Slavic]] culture affected the nature of Finnish national integration; the social upper faction took the lead, though it gained domestic might from the Russian Czar in 1809. The estates planned to build up an increasingly autonomous Finnish state, led by the elite and intelligentsia. The [[Fennomans]] aimed to include the common people in a nonpolitical role in order to reduce unrest due to social problems; the labor movement, youth associations and temperance movement were initially led &quot;from above.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Contrary to Central Europe and mainland Russia, the policies of the Swedish ruling regime resulted in the economic, political and social authority of the Finnish nobility-burghers not being based on marked feudal land property and capital. Instead, there were free peasants with no tradition of serfdom, and the might of the predominant estates was bound to the interaction between the state formation and industrialization. Forest industry was a vital sector for Finland and peasants owned a major part of the forest land and the wood raw material; the economy affected the birth of [[Fennomania]], among the Swedish-speaking upper faction, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=19–39, 85–100}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=40–46}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15–30}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31–44}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social conditions, the standard of living and the self-confidence of the workers gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916 but, while the standard of living rose among the common people, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly. The common people's rising awareness of the socioeconomic and political questions interacted with the ideas of [[socialism]], [[social liberalism]] and [[nationalism]] ([[Fennomania]]). The commoners' responses and the corresponding counteracts of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;Socialism was the antithesis of the class system of the estates,  {{Harvnb|Apunen|1987|pp=73–133}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=49–69, 245–250}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=250–288, 416–449}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15–30}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31–44}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish labor movement, which emerged at the end of the 19th century from [[temperance movement in Finland|temperance]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland#History|religious movements]] and [[Fennomania]], had a Finnish nationalist, [[working-class]] character. From 1899–1906 the labor movement became conclusively independent, shedding the patriarchal thinking of the [[Fennoman]] estates, and it was represented by the Finnish [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], established in 1899. Workers' activism directed both toward opposing [[Russification]] and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for [[democracy]]. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the Finnish nobility-burghers and the labor movement concerning voting rights for the common people.&lt;ref&gt;The power struggle of 1880–1905 dealing with voting rights appeared both within the estates' peasants-clergy vs. the nobility-burghers as a dispute of Swedish and Finnish language dominance, and between nobility-burghers vs. the labor movement; peasants-clergy supported voting rights for the common man in the class system, as it would have increased the political power of the Finnish-speaking population within the estates, {{Harvnb|Apunen|1987|pp=242–250}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=85–127, 150–151}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1992|pp=227–249}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=218–225}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=289–309, 416–449}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=38–55}}, {{Harvnb|Olkkonen|2003|pp=517–521}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15–30}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31–44}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2009|pp=12–75}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72–84}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides their obligations as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical inhabitants of the Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as the natural order of their life, the commoners began to ask for and then demand their [[civil rights]] and [[citizenship]] in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haapala|1992|pp=227–249}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=218–225}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15–30}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31–44}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political struggle for democracy was solved outside Finland, via international power politics; the Russian Empire's failed [[Russo-Japanese War|1904–1905 war against Japan]] led to the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Revolution]] in Russia and to [[Russian Revolution of 1905#Finland|a general strike in Finland]]. In an attempt to quell the general unrest, the system of estates was abolished in the [[Parliament of Finland#History|Parliamentary Reform of 1906]], which introduced [[universal suffrage]]. The general strike increased support for the [[Social Democrats]] substantially, as a proportion of the population, the party was the most powerful [[socialist]] movement in the world.&lt;ref&gt;The increasing political power of the left drew a part of the Finnish intelligentsia, mainly Fennomans from the Old Finnish party, to the labour movement: Julius Ailio, Edvard Gylling, Otto-Ville Kuusinen, Kullervo Manner, Hilja Pärssinen, Hannes Ryömä, Yrjö Sirola, Väinö Tanner, Karl H. Wiik, Elvira Willman, Väinö Voionmaa, Sulo Wuolijoki, Wäinö Wuolijoki (called the &quot;November 1905 socialists&quot;), {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=62–69, 90–97}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=250–288, 428–439}}, {{Harvnb|Nygård|2003|pp=553–565}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15–30}}, {{Harvnb|Payne|2011|pp=25–32}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reform of 1906 was a giant leap in the political and social liberalization of the common Finnish people; the Russian royal family was the most autocratic and conservative rulers in Europe. The Finns adopted a unicameral parliamentary system with all political rights for female citizens, increasing the number of voters from 126,000 to 1,273,000. This produced around 50% turnouts for the Social Democrats, but the Czar regained his authority after the crisis of 1905, and during the second period of Russification between 1908 and 1917  neutralized the power of the Parliament. He dissolved it and ordered parliamentary elections almost annually between 1908–1916, and determined the composition of the Finnish Senate, which did not correlate with the assembly of the Parliament, prohibiting true parliamentarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Apunen|1987|pp=242–250}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=85–100, 101–127, 150–151}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1992|pp=251–267}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=230–232}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=450–482}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=62–78}}, {{Harvnb|Jutikkala|Pirinen|2003|pp=372–373, 377}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=244–263}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacity of the Parliament to solve socioeconomic problems was stymied by confrontations between the largely uneducated common man and the former estates. Another conflict grew as employers denied collective bargaining and right of the labour unions to represent working people. The parliamentary process disappointed the labour movement, but dominance in the  Parliament and legislation was the workers' means to reach a more balanced society - they identified themselves to the state. The politics led to a struggle for leadership of the Finnish state, during the ten years before the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Apunen|1987|pp=242–250}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=85–100, 101–127, 150–151}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1992|pp=251–267}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=230–232}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=62–78}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=244–263}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31–44}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===February Revolution===
{{See also|February Revolution}}
[[File:General Strike Helsinki 1917.jpg|thumb|300px|On strike in [[Helsinki]], 1917. Workers demanded food and a complete shifting of legislative power from the [[Russian Provisional Government|Russian government]] to the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish parliament]].]]

The more severe programme of [[Russification]], called &quot;the Second Period of Oppression, 1908–1917&quot; by the Finns, was halted on 15 March 1917 by the removal of the Russian Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. The immediate reason for the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] was crisis caused by military defeats in the war against [[Imperial Germany]] and [[war-weariness]] among the Russians. The deeper causes lay in the collision between the most conservative and autocratic regime in [[Europe]] and the Russian people urging for socioeconomic modernization. The Czar's power was transferred to the [[Duma]] (Russian parliament) and the right-wing [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], but it was challenged by the [[Petrograd Soviet]], leading to [[dual power]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=51–54}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1986|pp=163–164}}, {{Harvnb|Pipes|1996|pp=75–97}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=230–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomous status was returned to the Finns in March 1917, and the revolt in Russia handed to the Finnish Parliament true political power for the first time. The political left, consisting mainly of Social Democrats, covered a wide spectrum from moderate to revolutionary socialists. The political right was even more diverse, ranging from social liberals and moderate conservatives to rightist conservative elements. The four main parties were:
* the conservative [[Finnish Party]]
* the [[Young Finnish Party]] including both [[liberalism|liberals]] and [[conservatism|conservatives]], the liberals divided to [[social liberals]] and [[economic liberals]]
* the social reformist, centrist [[Centre Party (Finland)|Agrarian League]], which drew its support mainly from peasants with small or middle-sized farms
* the conservative [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]], which sought to retain the rights of the former nobility and the [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking minority of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;There were few [[Bolsheviks]] in Finland. Bolshevism became more popular among Finnish industrial workers, who emigrated to [[Petrograd]] in the end of 19th Century. FP and YFP descendants of the old Fennoman parties, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=85–132}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=56–59, 142–147}}, {{Harvnb|Nygård|2003|pp=553–565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finns faced a detrimental interaction of power struggle and breakdown of society during 1917. The collapse of Russia induced a chain reaction of disintegration, starting from the government, military power and economy, and spreading downwards to all fields of the society such as local administration and workplaces, and finally to the level of individual citizens as changes and questions of freedom, responsibility and morality. The [[Social Democrats]] aimed at retaining the political rights of the labor movement already achieved, and gaining power over the people and society. The conservatives were fearful of losing their long-held socioeconomic might. Both factions, with groups aiming at major supremacy, collaborated with the corresponding political forces in Russia, deepening the split in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=109, 195–263}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=143–149}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=11–14}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2008|pp=255–261}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72–84}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the unbalanced social development and the labour movement's continuous position in the political opposition, the [[Social Democratic Party (Finland)|Social Democratic Party]] had gained an [[absolute majority]] in the new [[Parliament of Finland]], in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1916|general parliamentary elections of 1916]]. The new [[Senate of Finland|Senate]] was formed in March 1917 by Social Democrat and trade union leader [[Oskari Tokoi]]. The cabinet did not reflect the assembly of the Finnish parliament, with the socialist majority. It comprised six Social Democrats and six non-socialists. In theory, the Senate consisted of a broad national coalition, but in practice, with the main political groups unwilling to [[compromise]] and top politicians remaining outside, the cabinet proved unable to solve any major Finnish problems. After the February revolution, political power dispersed to the street level; mass meetings, strike organizations and worker/soldier councils, and to active organizations of the employers, all serving to undermine the authority of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=221, 232–235}}, {{Harvnb|Kirby|2006|p=150}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2008|pp=255–261}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid economic growth stimulated by [[World War I]], which had raised the incomes of industrial workers and profits of the employers during 1915 and 1916, collapsed with the [[February Revolution]]. The consequent decrease in production and economy led to unemployment and high [[inflation]]. For those who had a job, the February revolution gave freedom to reach for resolving long-term problems of their laborious working life. The workers called for [[eight-hour day|eight-hour-per-day]] working limits, better working conditions and higher wages. The demands led to demonstrations and large-scale strikes in both industry and agriculture throughout [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=95–98, 109–114}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=155–159, 197, 203–225}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The food supply of the country depended on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in [[milk]] and [[butter]] production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and [[price controls]]. The farmers opposed the state control; a [[black market]] with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the [[Petrograd]] area increased. Food supply, prices, and in the end the fear of [[starvation]] became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the war. Economic factors remained a supporting factor in the crisis of 1917, but only a secondary part of the power struggle of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=95–98, 109–114}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1986|pp=163–172}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=163–164, 192}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=155–159, 203–225}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle for leadership====
[[File:Anarkistimatruuseja.jpg|thumb|300px|Revolutionary Russian servicemen of various political groups added to the feeling of instability during 1917.]]

The passing of the Tokoi Senate bill, called the &quot;Power Act&quot;, in July 1917 became the first one of the three culminations of the power struggle between the Social Democrats and the conservatives during the political crisis from March 1917 to the end of January 1918. The fall of the Russian emperor opened the question of who would hold the highest political power in the former Grand Duchy. Although the Finns had accepted the liberating manifesto (from the period of 1908–1916) of March 1917 issued by the [[Russian Provisional Government]], they planned at least an expansion of the former [[autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=163–194}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=158–162, 195–196}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=35, 37, 39, 40, 50, 52}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[February Revolution]] offered the Finnish Social Democrats momentum: they had the absolute majority in the Parliament and a narrow dominance in the Senate. After the decades of political disappointments, the socialists gained an opportunity to take power. Conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists' might since 1899, with the climax in 1917 without the offsetting control of Russian administration; the Social Democrats had to be halted before they were able to markedly alter the power structure of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=163–194}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=158–162, 195–196}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=35, 37, 39, 40, 50, 52}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=229–245}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=487–524}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31–44}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008c|pp=95–109}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Power Act&quot; incorporated a plan by the Social Democrats to substantially increase the power of Parliament, as a reaction to the non-parliamentary and conservative leadership of the Finnish Senate between 1906 and 1916. The bill furthered Finnish autonomy by restricting Russia's influence on domestic affairs: the Provisional Government would determine the foreign and military policies of [[Finland]]. In Parliament, the bill was adopted with the support of the Social Democrats, the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Agrarian League]], some members of the [[Young Finnish Party]] and some Activists eager for Finnish sovereignty. The conservatives opposed the Act and some of the most right-wing representatives resigned from Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=50}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=229–245}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=502–524}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31–44}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008c|pp=95–109}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}, {{Harvnb|Jyränki|2014|pp=18–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Petrograd]], the Social Democrats' plan had the backing of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the [[Bolsheviks]], who by July 1917 were plotting a revolt against the Provisional Government. In the end, the Government still had the support of the Russian military; Lenin was thwarted during the &quot;[[July Days]]&quot; and forced to flee to Finland. As the Russians' war against Germany came increasingly closer to total defeat, the significance of the Finnish area as a buffer zone protecting [[Petrograd]] was highlighted, the Provisional Government disapproved the &quot;Power Act&quot; and sent reliable troops to Finland. There, with the demands and co-operation of Finnish conservatives, the Finnish Parliament was dissolved and new elections announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=163–194}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=158–162, 195–196}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1992|pp=251–267}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=35, 37, 39, 40, 50, 52}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=229–245}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=502–524}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2008|pp=255–261}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008c|pp=95–109}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51–89}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1917|October 1917 elections]], the Social Democrats lost their absolute majority, which radicalized the [[labor movement]] and decreased support for relying on parliamentary means of achieving its aims. The events of July 1917 did not bring about the Red Revolution in January 1918 on their own, but together with political development based on the labor movement's interpretation of the ideas of [[Fennomania]] and socialism since the 1880s, these events were decisive for the goals of a Finnish revolution. In order to win power, the socialists had to overcome the Finnish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=163–194}}, {{Harvnb|Kettunen|1986|pp=9–89}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=158–162, 195–196}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1992|pp=251–267}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=35, 37, 39, 40, 50, 52}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=229–245}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=502–524}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2008|pp=255–261}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31–44}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008c|pp=95–109}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse of Russia in the [[February Revolution]] resulted in a loss of institutional authority in Finland and the dissolution of the [[police]] force, creating fear and uncertainty. In response, both the right and left began assembling their own security groups, which were initially local and largely unarmed. By Autumn 1917, in the power struggle and vacuum following the dissolution of Parliament, and in the absence of a stable government or a [[Finnish army]], such forces began assuming a paramilitary character. The Civil/[[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] were organized by local men of influence, conservative academics, industrialists, major landowners and activists, and were armed by the Germans. The Workers' Security/[[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] were recruited through their local party sections and the labor unions, and were armed by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;The role of the Swedish-speaking upper class was important due to long-term influence in economy, industry, government-administration and military. The deepest battle for power appeared between the most left-wing [[socialists]] and the most right-wing elements of the [[Swedish language|Swedish-speaking]] conservatives, but the true role of language in that context was small, as many Swedish-speaking workers joined the Reds, {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=195–230}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1986|pp=166–167}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=151–167}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993c}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen*|1993a|pp=324–343}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=123–127, 237–243}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2009b|pp=112–143}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72–84}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===October Revolution===
{{See also|October Revolution}}
[[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|October/November Revolution]] on 7 November transferred political power in [[Petrograd]] to the radical, left-wing socialists. The [[German Empire]]'s intrigue, based on idea that Lenin was the most powerful weapon they could launch against Russia, to finance the Bolsheviks and arrange safe conduct of Lenin and his comrades from exile in [[Switzerland]] to Petrograd in April 1917, was a success. An [[Armistice between Russia and the Central Powers|armistice between Germany and the Bolshevik regime]] came into force on 6 December and peace negotiations began on 22 December 1917 at [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;The Bolsheviks received 15 million German Marks from Berlin after the October revolt, but Lenin's might was opportunely weak, and Russia engaged in a long and bloody Civil War which turned all the major Russian military, political and economic activities inwards, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=36}}, {{Harvnb|Pipes|1996|pp=113–149}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000|pp=86–95}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2009|pp=48–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

November 1917 saw the second turning point in the 1917–1918 rivalry for the leadership of Finland. After the dissolution of the Finnish Parliament, [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] between the Social Democrats and Conservatives increased dramatically, including political violence. An agricultural worker was shot during a local strike on 9 August at [[Ypäjä]] and a Civil Guard member was killed in aftermath of local political crisis at ''Malmi'' on 24 September 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=195–263}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=52, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The informal truce between the Finnish non-socialists and the [[Russian Provisional Government]] was disrupted by the October Revolution. After political wrangle how to react on the revolt, the majority of the politicians accepted  a compromising proposal of [[Santeri Alkio]], the leader of the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Agrarian League]]. The Finnish Parliament seizured the highest power in Finland, on 15 November, on the model of the &quot;Power Act&quot; of the socialists, and ratified the [[Social Democratic Party (Finland)|Social Democratic]] proposals from July 1917 of [[eight-hour working day]] and universal suffrage in [[local election]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=264–342}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=67, 70}}, {{Harvnb|Jyränki|2014|pp=18–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suojeluskunta.jpg|thumb|300px|White Guardsmen in [[Nummi]].]]
A purely non-socialist, conservative-led cabinet of [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] was appointed on 27 November. The nomination was both a long-term aim of the conservatives and a respond to the labour movements' acts during November 1917. Svinhufvud's main goals were to separate Finland from Russia, strengthen the military power of the Civil-White Guards and to return at least a part of the Parliament's new power to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=264–342}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=70}}, {{Harvnb|Jyränki|2014|pp=18–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 149 Civil-White Guards in Finland (local units in towns and rural communes) on 31 August 1917, 251 on 30 September, 315 on 31 October, 380 on 30 November 1917 and 408 on 26 January 1918. The first attempt at serious military training among the Civil Guards was the establishment of a 200-strong &quot;cavalry school&quot; at the Saksanniemi estate, in the vicinity of the town of [[Porvoo]], in September 1917. The [[vanguard]] of the Finnish [[Jäger Movement|Jägers]] and German weapons arrived in Finland in October–November 1917, on a ship ''Equity'' and a German U-boat ([[SM UC-57]]); around 50 Jägers had returned by the end of 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Despite of the German-Russian peace negotiations, the Germans agreed to sell 70,000 [[rifles]], 70 [[machine guns]] and artillery to the Whites and arrange the safe return of the Jäger battalion to Finland. The German arms were transported to Finland in February–March 1918, {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=195–263}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=59, 63, 66, 68, 98}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993b|pp=96–177}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen*|1993b|pp=393–395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the political defeats in July and October 1917, the Social Democrats put forward, on 1 November, an uncompromising program called &quot;We Demand&quot; in order to push for [[concession (politics)|political concessions]]; they demanded a return to the power political status before dissolution of the Parliament in July 1917, disbanding of the Civil Guards and elections to establish a Finnish Constituent Assembly. Following the October Revolution, based on the &quot;Power Act&quot;, socialists planned to ask the Bolsheviks for acceptance of Finland's sovereignty in a manifesto on 10 November, but the uncertain situation in Petrograd stalled the plan. After the &quot;We Demand&quot; program had failed, the socialists initiated a General strike on 14–19 November 1917 to increase the political pressure, in particular on the conservatives, who had opposed the &quot;Power Act&quot; and the 15 November parliamental Power proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=256–342}}, {{Harvnb|Ketola|1987|pp=368–384}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=66}}, {{Harvnb|Jyränki|2014|pp=18–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Revolution]] had been the goal of the radical left since the loss of the political power in July and October 1917, and November 1917 offered momentum for an uprising. At this phase, Lenin and [[Joseph Stalin]], under threat in Petrograd, urged the Social Democrats to seize power in Finland. The majority of Finnish socialists were moderate and preferred parliamentary methods, prompting [[Lenin]] to label them &quot;reluctant revolutionaries.&quot; The reluctance diminished as the General strike appeared to offer a major power for the workers in southern Finland. The strike leadership voted by a narrow majority to seize power on 16 November, but the proposed revolution had to be called off the same day, due to lack of true revolutionaries for executing the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=264–342}}, {{Harvnb|Ketola|1987|pp=368–384}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen|1992 et al.|pp=64}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=152–156}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Redguard.jpg|thumb|200px|Red troopers.]]
The moderate socialists won a repeated vote over revolutionary versus parliamentary means at a special party meeting in the end of November 1917, but when they tried to pass a resolution to completely abandon the idea of a socialist revolution, the party representatives and several powerful leaders voted it down. The Finnish labor movement wanted to sustain a military force of its own and keep the revolutionary road open too. The Finnish socialists' weak interest in revolutionary activity was a disappointment to [[Lenin]]. He lost his faith in them finally in December 1917 and shifted his energies toward encouraging the [[Bolsheviks|Finnish Bolsheviks]] in Petrograd.&lt;ref&gt;The Russian District Committee in Finland was the first one to reject the authority of the Provisional Government, at the beginning of the October revolt. Lenin's pessimistic comment, on 27th January 1918, to Finnish Bolshevik Eino Rahja is well known: &quot;No comrade Rahja, this time you will not win your campaign, because you have the power of the Finnish Social Democrats in Finland&quot;, {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=264–342}}, {{Harvnb|Ketola|1987|pp=368–384}}, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1989|pp=83–161}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=70}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the labor movement, a more marked consequence of Autumn 1917 was the rise of the Workers' Guards. There were approximately 20–60 Guards between 31 August and 30 September 1917, but on 20 October, after the defeat in the October Parliamentary elections, the Finnish Labor Union proclaimed the need to establish more worker units. The announcement led to a rush of recruits; on 31 October the number of Guards was 100–150, 342 on 30 November 1917 and 375 on 26 January 1918. There were two parts to the units since May 1917, most being Security Guards. The minority were Red Guards; partly secret groups formed in industrialized towns and industrial centres including  [[Helsinki]], [[Kotka]], [[Tampere]], [[Turku]], [[Viipuri]] and the [[Kymenlaakso]] area, on the model of the domestic Red Guards built up during 1905–1906 in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Manninen*|1993a|pp=324–343}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen*|1993b|pp=393–395}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=282–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of the two opposing armed forces, the Red and White Guards, imposed a state of dual power and multiple sovereignty on Finnish society, typically the prelude to a civil war. The decisive cleavage between the guards broke out during the General strike; the Reds executed several political opponents in southern Finland, and the first armed clashes between the Whites and Reds broke out. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to a race for [[weapons]] and an [[Conflict escalation|escalation]] towards civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=317–342}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981a|pp=15–65}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=151–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence of Finland===
The disintegration of Russia offered the [[Finns]] a historic opportunity to gain national independence, but after the [[October Revolution]], the positions of the conservatives and the Social Democrats on the sovereignty issue became reversed. The conservatives were eager for secession from Russia, in order to control the left and minimize the influence of the Bolsheviks. The socialists feared a loss of support among nationalistic workers, after promises of increasing liberty, through the &quot;Power Act&quot;. Both political factions supported Finland's sovereignty, despite strong disagreement on selection of the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=67, 70}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=235–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nationalism]] became a &quot;civic religion&quot; among the Finns by the end of 19th century, but their goal during the General strike/Revolt of 1905, was a return to the autonomy of 1809–1898, not independence. The domestic power of the Finns had increased, under the less uniform Russian rule - compared to the unitary Swedish regime. In economy the Grand Duchy benefited from an independent domestic state budget, own currency (the [[Finnish markka|markka]], since 1860) and customs organization, and the industrial progress during 1860–1916. The economy was dependent on the huge Russian market and a separation would break up the profitable Finnish financial zone. The economic collapse of Russia and the political power struggle of the Finnish state during 1917 were among the key factors that brought sovereignty to the fore in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;The Activists planned also a Finnish Grand Duchy ruled either by Germany or Sweden. Until 1914 Finland exported refined forest and metal products to Russia, and sawmill and bulk wood products to Western Europe. WWI cut off the export to the West, and directed most of the beneficial wartrade to Russia. Since 1917 the export to Russia collapsed, and after 1919 the Finns penetrated to the western market due to the high demand of products, after WWI, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=89–100}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=49–73, 156–159, 243–245}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=483–524}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=9–10, 181–182, 203–204, 264–276}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15–30}}, {{Harvnb|Kuisma|2010|pp=13–81}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2010|pp=108–173}}, {{Harvnb|Ahlbäck|2014|pp=254–293}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2014|pp=216–250}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51–89}}, {{Harvnb|Hentilä|Hentilä|2016|pp=15–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ven tunnustaa Suomen itsenisyyden.png|thumb|The signed document of Bolshevik government's recognition of independence of Finland. Some minutes before midnight, two men with opposite worldviews, P.E. Svinhufvud and V.I. Lenin shook hands for Finnish sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
P.E. Svinhufvud's Senate proposed [[Finland's declaration of independence]], which the Parliament adopted on 6 December 1917. The Social Democrats voted against the Senate's proposal while presenting an alternative declaration for sovereignty. The establishment of an independent state was not a foregone conclusion for the small Finnish nation; recognition by Russia and the [[great power|European powers]] was essential. Svinhufvud accepted, that he had to negotiate with Lenin for Russian recognition. The socialists, reluctant to talks with the Russian leadership in July 1917, sent two delegations to [[Petrograd]] to ask Lenin to approve Finnish sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Svinhufvud's initial vision; the Senate leads Finland and independence process (call for a [[Regent]]), no talks with the Bolsheviks as they will not set non-socialist Finland free, without pressure from Germany. Socialists' vision; the Parliament leads Finland, independence achieved easier through negotiations with (weak) Bolsheviks than with other parties of [[Russian Constituent Assembly]], {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=343–382}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=73, 78}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993c}}, {{Harvnb|Jutikkala|1995|pp=11–20}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}, {{Harvnb|Jyränki|2014|pp=18–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1917 the Bolsheviks were under intense pressure from the Germans to conclude [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk]], and Russia Bolshevism was in crisis, with a demoralized army and the fate of the October Revolution in doubt. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could hold central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the [[geopolitically]] less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud and his senate delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Bolshevist]] [[Council of People's Commissars]] ratified the recognition on 4 January 1918, {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=343–382}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=79, 81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the Civil War, [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Denmark]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Germany]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]] had recognized Finnish independence. The [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] did not approve it; they stood by and followed the relations between Finland and Germany, the main enemy of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], which hoped to override Lenin's regime and get Russia back into the war against the Germans. As to Finland's separation from Russia, Germany hastened it, in order to get Finland within the German power sphere. France broke off diplomatic relations to the White government of the 1918 war, due to the Whites' co-operation with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=343–382}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=80, 81}}, {{Harvnb|Pietiäinen|1992|pp=252–403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warfare==

===Escalation===
The final escalation towards war began in early January 1918, as each military or political act of the Reds or the Whites resulted in a corresponding counteraction by the opponent. Both sides justified the acts as defensive measures, particularly to their own supporters. On the left, the [[vanguard]] of the war was the active, urban Red Guards from [[Helsinki]], [[Kotka]] and [[Turku]]; they led the rural Reds, and convinced the socialist leaders who wavered between peace and war to support revolution. On the right, the vanguard of the conflict was the Jägers who had been moved to Finland by the end of 1917, and the active volunteer White Guards of [[Viipuri province]] in the southeastern corner of Finland, southwestern Finland and southern [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]]. The first  local battles were fought during 9–21 January in southern and southeastern Finland, mainly to win the race for weapons and for controlling the [[Viipuri]] town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=390–515}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981a|pp=15–65, 177–182}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen*|1993c|pp=398–432}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2009a|pp=92–111}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51–89}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ali Aaltonen.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Ali Aaltonen]], the first commander in chief of the Finnish Reds.]]
The Svinhufvud Senate and the Parliament decided, on 12 January 1918 to create a &quot;State power of internal order and discipline&quot;, leaning on the White forces. On 15 January, [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], a competent former general of the [[Imperial Russian Army]], was appointed supreme commander of the White Guards. He established a major power base in [[Vaasa]]-[[Seinäjoki]] area. The Senate renamed the White Guards the Finnish White Army and the White Order to engage was issued, on 25 January. The Whites gained weaponry by disarmament of Russian garrisons during 21–28 January, in particular in southern Ostrobothnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=390–515}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=80–89}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993b|pp=96–177}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen*|1993c|pp=398–432}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004b|pp=175–188}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Guards, led by [[Ali Aaltonen]], refused to recognise the Whites Guard's power status, and decided to establish a military authority of their own. Aaltonen placed the Red power base in Helsinki. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January 1918, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the Uprising, was lit in the tower of the [[Helsinki Workers' Hall]]. The large scale mobilization of the Reds began in the late evening of 27 January, with the Helsinki Guard and some of the Guards located along the Viipuri-[[Tampere]] railway having become active between 23–26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolsheviks' weapons from [[Petrograd]] to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment; 20–30 Finns, Red and White, died in the &quot;Battle of the Rahja Trains&quot; in the [[Karelian Isthmus]] on 27 January 1918.&lt;ref&gt;The Reds won the battle and gained 20,000 rifles, 30 machine guns, 10 cannons and 2 armored vehicles. Russians delivered in total 20,000 rifles from Helsinki and Tampere depots to the Reds. The Whites captured 14,500 rifles, 90 machine guns, 40 cannons and 4 mortars from the Russian garrisons. Some Russian army officers did business by selling their unit weapons, both to the Reds and Whites, {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=390–515}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981a|pp=15–65, 177–182}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=80–89}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993b|pp=96–177}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen*|1993c|pp=398–432}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and final culmination of the Finnish power struggle and the disintegration of the society had begun.

===Finland divided into White and Red===
[[File:FinnishCivilWarMapBegin.svg|thumb|300px|The initial frontlines and offensives of the war at the beginning of February. Areas controlled by the Reds are in red.]]

At the beginning of the war, a discontinuous [[front line]] ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into [[White Finland]] and [[Red Finland]]. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of [[croft (land)|crofters]] and [[tenant farmer]]s. The White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few, or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed on both sides of the front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of [[Varkaus]], [[Kuopio]], [[Oulu]], [[Raahe]], [[Kemi]] and [[Tornio]]; within the Red area lay [[Porvoo]], [[Kirkkonummi]] and [[Uusikaupunki]]. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=91–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Finland, called also the [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]], was led by the [[Finnish People's Delegation|People's Delegation]], established on 28 January, in [[Helsinki]]. The delegation sought democratic socialism based on the Finnish Social Democratic ethos; their visions differed from Lenin's [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. [[Otto Ville Kuusinen]] formulated a proposal for a new constitution, influenced by those of [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States]]. Political power was to be concentrated to Parliament, with a lesser role for Senate. The proposal included a multi-party system, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and press, and the use of [[referenda]] in political decision making. In order to ensure the power of the [[labour movement]], the common people would have a right to &quot;[[Permanent revolution|continuous revolution]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;ideological father&quot; of the socialists, [[Karl Kautsky]], disapproved the Finnish Red Revolution. Kautsky, an opponent of V.I. Lenin, supported reformist policy, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=417–429}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=88, 102}}, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486–627}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentilä|Nevakivi|1999|pp=108}}, {{Harvnb|Suodenjoki|2009a|pp=246–269}}, {{Harvnb|Payne|2011|pp=25–32}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reds' plans concerning [[private property rights]] were in conflict with their plans for an &quot;ultrademocratic&quot; and free society; the state and local administration of [[municipalities]] would have had true property rights. In agriculture the crofters were liberated from the control of the landowners at the beginning of the war, but they were allowed a right of containment of the farms under the plans of a later general [[socialization]] in the country. All these plans, including the new constitution, remained unfulfilled, as the Reds lost the 1918 war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=417–429}}, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486–627}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentilä|Nevakivi|1999|pp=108}}, {{Harvnb|Suodenjoki|2009a|pp=246–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign policy Red Finland leaned on [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]]. A Finnish-Russian Red treaty and peace agreement was signed on 1 March 1918. The negotiations for the treaty revealed, that, as in [[World War I]] in general, [[nationalism]] was more important for both sides than the principles of [[international socialism]]. The Red Finns did not accept alliance with the Bolsheviks and major disputes appeared e.g. over demarcation of the border between Red Finland and Soviet Russia. The bargaining sides exchanged land areas; an [[artillery]] base, [[Fort Ino|Ino]], located in the [[Karelian Isthmus]], was transferred to Russia, while Finland received [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] in north-eastern [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]. The significance of the Russian-Finnish Treaty evaporated soon, due to the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] between the Bolsheviks and the [[German Empire]] on 3 March 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=262–265}}, {{Harvnb|Pietiäinen|1992|pp=252–403}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

V. I. Lenin's policy of the right of nations to [[self-determination]] aimed at preventing the disintegration of Russia during the period of military weakness. He tried to utilize the power vacuums and political rivalries commonly formed inside fledgling nations as they separated from major, splintering countries. Lenin expected that in the political circumstances of [[Europe]] at the time, the [[proletariat]] of free nations would carry out socialist revolutions, and unite with Soviet Russia later. The majority of the Finnish labor movement supported Finland's independence. The Finnish Bolsheviks, influential though few in number, favoured annexation of Finland by Russia. The question of annexation, in the aftermath of World War I, was resolved by the defeat of Red Finland and weakness of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;After the [[Russian Civil War]] gradually reinforcing Russia recaptured many of the nations that had become independent in 1918, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=255–278}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen|1992|pp=94, 106}}, {{Harvnb|Pietiäinen|1992|pp=252–403}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993c}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21–32}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=276–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of White Finland, [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud's first senate]], was called ''the Vaasa Senate'' after relocation to the west-coast city of [[Vaasa]], acting as the capital of the Whites from 29 January to 3 May. In domestic policy the White Senate's main goal was to return the political right to power in Finland. The conservatives planned a monarchist political system, with a lesser role for Parliament. A section of the conservatives had always supported [[monarchy]] and opposed [[democracy]]; others approved [[parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]] since the revolutionary reform of 1906, but after the crisis of 1917-1918 concluded, that empowering the common people would not work. Social liberals and reformist non-socialists opposed any restriction of parliamentarianism. They initially resisted German military help, but the prolonged warfare changed their stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=62–68}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=38–46, 56–115}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|2009|pp=376–394}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign policy, the Vaasa Senate leaned on the German Empire for military and political aid, in order to defeat the Finnish Red Guards, end the influence of Bolshevist Russia in Finland, and expand Finnish territory to Russian Karelia, which held [[geopolitical]] significance, and was home to people speaking [[Finno-Ugric languages]] ([[Irredentism|Irredentist]] campaigns/[[Heimosodat]]). The weakness of Russia induced an idea of [[Greater Finland]] among the expansive factions of both the right and left; the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed on the need to take over eastern Karelia and for German weapons, but opposed German intervention in Finland. Mannerheim recognized the lack of combat skills of the Finnish Red Guards, and he leaned on the high military skills of the Finnish Jägers. As a former Russian army officer, Mannerheim was well aware of the demoralization of the Russian army. He co-operated with White Russian officers in Finland and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;The fall of the Russian Empire, the October revolt and Finnish Germanism had placed C.G.E. Mannerheim in a controversial position; he opposed the Finnish and Russian Reds and Germany together with the Russian White officers, who did not support independence of Finland, {{Harvnb|Klemettilä|1989|pp=163–203}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=102, 142}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21–32}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=516–524}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004b|pp=175–188}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2012|pp=7–47}}, {{Harvnb|Roselius|2014|pp=119–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competing parties' war [[propaganda]] aimed to prove their support of democracy and liberty and their ability to represent the whole Finnish nation. Both failed by allowing the political crisis to end up in the bloody Civil War and a comprehensive terror, instead of reaching a compromise to accomplish a peaceful political settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486–627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FinnishCivilWarMapMiddle.svg|thumb|350px|The main offensives to the end of March. Whites besiege Tampere and Finnish-Russian Reds at Rautu, on the Karelian Isthmus.]]

====Soldiers on rails====
[[File:PunaistenJuna.jpg|left|thumb|220px|The Russian armoured train ''Partisan'', which assisted the Finnish Reds in the [[Viipuri]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eerola|2010|pp=123–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The number of Finnish troops on each side varied from 70,000 to 90,000 and both had around 100,000 rifles, 300-400 machine guns and a few hundred cannons. While the Red Guards consisted mostly of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] (wages paid at the beginning of the war), the White Army contained only 11,000–15,000 volunteers, the remainder being [[conscription|conscripts]]. The main motives for volunteering were economic factors ([[salary]], food), idealism, and peer pressure. The Red Guards included 2,000 female troops, mostly girls recruited from the industrial centres of southern Finland. Urban and agricultural workers constituted the majority of the Red Guards, whereas land-owning farmers and well-educated people formed the backbone of the White Army.&lt;ref&gt;Some Whites supporting women demanded establishment of female White Guards. Mannerheim stalled the plan, but single women became warriors, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981a|pp=154–176}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1993|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993b|pp=96–177}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21–32}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=85–106}}, {{Harvnb|Lintunen|2014|pp=201–229}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both armies used [[child soldiers]], mainly between 14 and 17 years of age. The usage of juvenile soldiers was not rare in [[World War I]]; children of the time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever they could get their hands on, at the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=25–30, 141–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish Civil War was fought primarily along the [[railways]], the vital means of transporting troops and supplies. The strategically most important railway junction was  [[Haapamäki]], northeast of [[Tampere]], connecting both western-eastern and southern-northern Finland. The other vital junctions were [[Kouvola]], [[Riihimäki]], Tampere, [[Toijala]] and Viipuri. The Whites captured Haapamäki at the end of January 1918, leading to fierce battles at [[Vilppula]]. The significance of the railways is well symbolized by the most frightening weapon used in the turmoil: [[armoured train]], carrying light cannons and [[heavy machine gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981a|pp=177–205}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993a|pp=15–21}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21–32}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FinnishCivilWarMapEnd.svg|thumb|350px|The German intervention, grey arrows, and the final offensives.]]

===Red Guards and the Russian troops===
The Finnish Red Guards seized the early initiative in the war, taking control of [[Helsinki]] on 28 January, and with a general attack phase lasting from February till early March 1918. The Reds were relatively well armed, but a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalize on their initial [[momentum]], and most of the offensives came to nothing. The military order chain functioned relatively well at Red company and platoon level, but leadership and authority were weak, as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troopers. The common troopers were more or less armed civilians, whose military training, discipline and combat morale were both inadequate and low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981a|pp=177–205}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=227–255}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ali Aaltonen]] found himself rapidly replaced in command of the Red troops by [[Eero Haapalainen]], who in turn was replaced by the triumvirate of [[Eino Rahja]], [[Adolf Taimi]] and [[Evert Eloranta]]. The last commander of the Red Guards was [[Kullervo Manner]], who led the final retreat into [[Russia]]. Some talented men with a high sense of responsibility such as [[Hugo Salmela]] rose up to take the lead, but they could not change the course of the war. The Red Guards achieved victories, only at local level, as they retreated from southern Finland towards Russia; they won German troops in the fierce [[Battle of Syrjäntaka]] on 28–29 April 1918 in [[Tuulos]], where female [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guard]] platoons played a combat role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=227–255}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981b|pp=233–236}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=70–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Red officers.jpg|thumb|300px|Red officers on their horses.]]
Although some 60,000 Russian soldiers of the former Czar's army remained stationed in Finland at the start of the Civil War, the Russian contribution to the Reds' cause was negligible. The troopers were demoralized and war-weary, and the home-sick, former [[serfs]] were thirsty for farmland set free by the revolutions. The majority of the troops returned to Russia by the end of March 1918. In total 7,000 to 10,000 soldiers participated in the 1918 war, of which around 4,000, in separate smaller units of 100–1,000 men, could be persuaded to fight in the front line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981a|pp=154–176}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=265–278}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=89}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21–32}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004b|pp=175–188}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=276–291}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2009b|pp=112–143}},{{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian revolutions split the Russian army officers politically and their attitude toward the Finnish civil war varied; [[Mikhail Svechnikov]] led Finnish Red troops in western Finland in February and ''Konstantin Yeremejev'' the Russian forces in the [[Karelian Isthmus]], while other officers were mistrustful of their revolutionary underlings and co-operated with the former colleague General [[Mannerheim]], assisting the Whites in the disarmament of the Russian garrisons in Finland. On 30 January 1918 Mannerheim proclaimed to Russian soldiers in [[Finland]] that the White army did not fight against Russia: the goal of the White campaign was to beat the Finnish Red rebels and the Russian troops supporting them.&lt;ref&gt;Mannerheim promised the co-operating officers their personal freedom, while many of those opposing the Whites were executed. Some Russian army Red officers were executed by the Finnish Reds after the bitter defeat in the Battle for Tampere, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981a|pp=154–176}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=265–278}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=89}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21–32}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004b|pp=175–188}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2008a|pp=188–199}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2009b|pp=112–143}}, {{Harvnb|Muilu|2010|pp=9–86}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Russian soldiers active in the Civil War declined markedly once [[Germany]] attacked Russia on 18 February 1918. The German-Russian [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] of 3 March, restricted the Bolsheviks' support for the Finnish Reds to weapons and supplies. The Russians remained active on the south-eastern front, mainly in the battles of [[Rautu]] (Sosnovo) railway station, Karelian Isthmus, between 21 February and 6 April 1918. They defended the approaches to Petrograd.&lt;ref&gt;The Russian Bolsheviks declared war against White Finland after the Whites had attacked the Russian garrisons in Finland, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=259–262}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993c|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|Häikiö|1995|p=98}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21–32}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White Guards and Sweden's role===
[[File:Jaakarit vaasan torilla.jpg|thumb|300px|Jaegers in Vaasa, Finland, 25 February 1918. The battalion is being inspected by General C.G.E. Mannerheim.]]
While the conflict has been called by some &quot;The War of the Amateurs&quot;, the White Army had two major advantages over the Red Guards in the war: the professional military leadership of General Mannerheim and his staff—which included 84 Swedish volunteer officers and former Finnish officers of the Czar's army—and 1,450 soldiers of the 1,900-strong, elite [[Finnish Jäger troops|Jäger ''(Jääkärit)'']] battalion. This battalion was trained in Germany during 1915–1917, and battle-hardened on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. The main part of the battalion arrived in [[Vaasa]] on 25 February 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;Upton 1981 62–144&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=62–144}}, {{Harvnb|Roselius|2006|pp=151–160}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2009|pp=48–57}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the battlefield the Jägers provided strong leadership that made disciplined action by the common White soldiers possible. The White troopers were similar to those of the Red Guards: most of them had brief and inadequate training. At the beginning of the war, the leadership of the White Guards had little authority over volunteer White Guard platoons and companies, which obeyed only their dominant, local leaders. In the end of February, the Jägers started rapid training of six Jäger Regiments, with conscripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Upton 1981 62–144&quot;/&gt;

Even the Jäger battalion was divided in the same way that the rest of the country was: 450 mostly socialist Jägers remained stationed in [[Germany]] as they could have chosen the Red side in the conflict. The leaders of the White Guards faced a similar problem with drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labor movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troopers drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds; the White's propaganda promoted a nationalist war against the Red, [[Bolshevist]] Russians, and belittled the significance of the Red Finns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=9–50}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=40–51, 74–77}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1993|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993b|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=90–92}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=264–291}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2009|pp=48–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social divisions did appear both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland. The economy and society of the north had modernized more slowly than those of the south, there was a more pronounced conflict between [[Christianity]] and [[socialism]] in the north, and [[farmland]] had a major social status; ownership of even a small parcel of land created a motivation to fight against the Reds.&lt;ref&gt;Economy of Ostrobothnia declined, due to weak industrialization after end of commercial [[tar]] production and grain export to Sweden. The fall led to political and religious conservatism, and emigration to USA after rapid population growth, {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=9–50}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=40–51, 74–77}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1993|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993b|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweden]] declared neutrality during World War I  and  the Finnish Civil War.  The general opinion, in particular among the Swedish elite was divided between supporters of the [[Allies]] and the [[Central powers]], [[Pan-Germanism|Germanism]] being somewhat more popular. Three  war-time  priorities determined pragmatic policy of the Swedish liberal-social democratic government;  sound economics, via export of [[iron-ore]] and foodstuff to Germany, sustaining tranquility of the Swedish society and geopolitics. The government accepted participation of Swedish  volunteer officers and soldiers in the  Finnish Civil War, on the White side, in order to block expansion of revolutionary unrest to [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Swedish Germanism included an idea of &quot;Greater Sweden&quot;, with plans to take over the Finnish area, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=483–524}}, {{Harvnb|Lindqvist|2003|pp=705–719}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2014|pp=216–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 800–1,000-strong &quot;Swedish Brigade&quot;, led by [[Hjalmar Frisell]], took part in the battles of [[Tampere]] and those fought in the area south of the town. In February 1918, the Swedish Navy escorted the German naval squadron, transporting Finnish Jägers and German weapons, and allowed it to pass through Swedish territorial waters. The Swedish socialists did not aid the Finnish Reds but tried to open peace negotiations between the Whites and Reds. The weakness of Finland gave Sweden a chance to take-over geopolitically vital Finnish [[Åland islands]], east of [[Stockholm]], but the German army's Finland-operation stalled the plan.&lt;ref&gt;On 31 December 1917 the people of Åland proclaimed, by a 57% majority their will to join the islands to the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]. The question of controlling Åland became a matter of dispute between Sweden and Finland after WWI,  {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=990–120}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=79, 97}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=483–524}}, {{Harvnb|Lindqvist|2003|pp=705–719}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2009b|p=130}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2014|pp=216–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Tampere====
{{Main article| Battle of Tampere}}

[[File:Tampere war victims 1918.jpg|thumb|300px|Unburied bodies after the [[Battle of Tampere]].]]
In February 1918 General Mannerheim weighed the question of where to focus the general offensive of the Whites, between two strategically vital enemy strongholds: [[Tampere]], Finland's major industrial town in the south-west, and [[Viipuri]], Karelia's main city. Although seizing Viipuri offered major advantages, the lack of combat skills of his army and potential for a major counterattack by the enemy in the area or in the south-west made it too risky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=180–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mannerheim decided to strike first at Tampere. He launched the attack on 16 March at [[Längelmäki]], 65&amp;nbsp;km north-east of the town. At the same time, the White Army began advancing along a northern and north-western frontline, through [[Vilppula]]–[[Kuru, Finland|Kuru]]–''Kyröskoski''–[[Suodenniemi]]. Many Red Guard units collapsed and retreated in panic under the weight of the assault, while some detachments defended their posts relentlessly, and were able to slow the advance of the White Guards, who were unaccustomed to offensive warfare. Eventually, the Whites lay siege to Tampere. They cut off the Reds southward connection in [[Lempäälä]] on 24 March and westward in ''Siuro'' ([[Nokia, Finland]]) and [[Ylöjärvi]] on 25 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=180–445}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993a|pp=103–295, 429–443}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|Häikiö|1995|pp=92–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle for Tampere was fought between 16,000 White and 14,000 Red soldiers. It was Finland's first large scale [[urban warfare|urban battle]], and, along with the battles of [[Helsinki]] and Viipuri, one of the three decisive military engagements of the 1918 war. The fight for the Tampere town area began on 28 March, on the eve of Easter 1918, later called the &quot;Bloody Maundy Thursday&quot;, in the Kalevankangas graveyard. After this fierce combat, won by the Whites, with more than 50% losses in some of the attacking units, the White army re-organized the troops and plans, and attacked the town centre, in the early hours of 3 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahto 1993 180–445&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981b|pp=144–148, 156–170}}, {{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=180–445}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993a|pp=103–295, 429–443}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|Häikiö|1995|pp=92–97}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2008b|pp=96–161}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a heavy, concentrated artillery barrage, the White Guards began advancing from house to house and street to street, as the Red Guards retreated. In the late evening of 3 April the Whites reached the eastern river banks of [[Tammerkoski]]. The Reds' major attempts to break the siege of Tampere from outside, along the Helsinki-Tampere railway, failed. The Red Guards lost the western parts of the town between 4 and 5 April. The [[Tampere City Hall]] was among the last strongholds of the Red troops. The battle ended 6 April 1918 with the surrender of Red forces in the [[Pyynikki]] and [[Pispala]] sections of Tampere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahto 1993 180–445&quot;/&gt;

In the battle, the Reds, now on the defensive, showed increased motivation to fight. General Mannerheim was compelled to deploy some of the best trained Jäger detachments, initially conserved for later use in the Viipuri area. The fighting in Tampere was a civil war—Finn against Finn, &quot;brother rising against brother&quot;—as most of the Russian army had retreated to Russia in March and the German troops had yet to arrive in Finland. The Battle of Tampere was the bloodiest action of the Civil War. The White Army lost 700–900 men, including 50 Jägers, the highest number of deaths the former Jäger battalion suffered in a single battle of the 1918 war. The Red Guards lost 1,000–1,500 soldiers, with a further 11,000–12,000 captured. 71 civilians died, mainly due to artillery fire. The eastern parts of the city, consisting mostly of wooden buildings, were destroyed completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=317–368}}, {{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=180–445}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993a|pp=103–295, 429–443}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|Häikiö|1995|pp=92–97}},  {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2008b|pp=96–161}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Viipuri====
{{Main article|Battle of Vyborg}}
After their defeat in Tampere, the Red Guards began a slow retreat eastwards. As the German army seized Helsinki, the White Army shifted the military focus to Viipuri; 18,500 Whites raided against 15,000 Red defending troopers. The Jäger detachments played a major role in the battle. The Whites were able to lay siege to Viipuri and cut the Reds' connection to Petrograd, in the fierce combats, in the [[Karelian Isthmus]] on 20–26 April. The final attack to the town began on late 27 April with a heavy, concentrated Jäger artillery barrage. The Reds' tough defence in the street combat collapsed gradually and eventually the Whites conquered Patterinmäki - the symbolic Last Stand-hill of the Finnish Red 1918 Uprising - in the center of Viipuri, on early hours of 29 April 1918. In total and 500–800 Reds died, and 12,000–15,000 were imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981b|pp=170–174}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=424–446}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|Häikiö|1995|p=112}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=131, 133}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2009c|pp=199–223}}, {{Harvnb|Keskisarja|2013|pp=232–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German intervention===

{{Main article|Baltic Sea Division}}
The German Empire intervened in the Finnish Civil War on the side of the White Army in March 1918. The Finnish Activists leaning on [[Pan-Germanism|Germanism]] had been seeking German aid in freeing Finland from Russian hegemony since Autumn 1917, but the Germans did not want to prejudice their armistice and [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk#Peace negotiations|peace negotiations]] with Russia because of the pressure they were facing at the Western front. The German stance changed after 10 February when [[Leon Trotsky]], despite the weakness of the Bolsheviks' position, broke off negotiations, hoping revolutions would break out in the German Empire and change everything. The German government promptly decided to teach Russia a lesson and, as a pretext for aggression, invited &quot;requests for help&quot; from the smaller countries west of Russia. Representatives of White Finland in [[Berlin]] duly requested help on 14 February; on 13 February the German Imperial Military Council had made the decision to send troops to Finland.&lt;ref&gt;On 7 March, the representatives E.Hjelt &amp; R.Erich signed disadvantageous German-Finnish agreements, and promised to pay  costs of the German military assistance, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=8–18, 87–92}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=108}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentilä|Nevakivi|1999|p=117}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2012|pp=7–47}}, {{Harvnb|Hentilä|Hentilä|2016|pp=41–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans attacked Russia on 18 February; [[Operation Faustschlag|the offensive]] led to a rapid collapse and retreat of the Russian troops and to signature of the first [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] by the Bolsheviks on 3 March 1918. Finland, the Baltic countries, [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] were transferred to the German power sphere. The economic and political investments that Germany had made in [[Vladimir Lenin]] had paid off. The German army did not alter the military plans concerning Finland after the peace treaty with the Bolsheviks because the Civil War of the Finns opened an easy access with low costs to [[Fennoscandia]]. There, the [[geopolitical]] status altered as troops of a British Naval squadron invaded the harbour of [[Murmansk]] on the northwestern coast of Russia by the [[Arctic Ocean]] on 9 March 1918. General [[Erich Ludendorff]] wanted both to chain Petrograd through [[Narva]] - Viipuri and German-led monarchy for Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Murmansk-Petrograd [[Kirov Railway]] was deployed in 1916, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=62–144}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=108}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2009|pp=48–57}}, {{Harvnb|Roselius|2014|pp=119–155}}, {{Harvnb|Hentilä|Hentilä|2016|pp=41–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March a German naval squadron landed in the southwestern archipelago of Finland, on the [[Åland|Åland Islands]], which the Swedish military expedition took over in mid-February (departed in May). On 3 April 1918, the 10,000-strong [[Baltic Sea Division]] (&quot;the Northern Fist Punch&quot;), led by [[Rüdiger von der Goltz]], launched the main attack, west of Helsinki at [[Hanko]], followed on 7 April by the 3,000-strong [[Detachment Brandenstein]] taking the town of [[Loviisa]] on the south-eastern coast. The main German formations advanced rapidly eastwards from Hanko and took Helsinki on 12–13 April. The ''Brigade Brandenstein'' overran the town of [[Lahti]] on 19 April, cutting the connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. The main German detachment advanced northwards from Helsinki and took [[Hyvinkää]] and [[Riihimäki]] on 21–22 April, followed by [[Hämeenlinna]] on 26 April. The efficient performance of the German top detachments contrasted strikingly with that of the demoralized Russian troops. The final blow to the cause of the Finnish Reds was dealt when the Bolsheviks broke off the peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, leading to the German eastern offensive in February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=369–424}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=41–44}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen|1992|p=97}}, {{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=180–445}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentilä|Nevakivi|1999|p=117}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2009|pp=48–57}}, {{Harvnb|Hentilä|Hentilä|2016|pp=117–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Helsinki====
{{Main article|Battle of Helsinki}}
After peace talks between the Germans and the Finnish Reds were broken off on 11 April, the true battle for the capital of Finland began. On 12 April, at 5 a.m. 2,000–3,000 German soldiers from the ''Brigade von Tshirsky'' attacked the city from the north-west, supported via the Helsinki-[[Turku]] railway. The Germans broke through the area between [[Munkkiniemi]] and [[Pasila]], and advanced on the central-western parts of the town. The German naval squadron [[Hugo Meurer|Meurer]] blocked the city harbour, bombarded the southern town area, and landed naval troops at [[Katajanokka]].&lt;ref&gt;The Russian Navy in Helsinki harbor remained neutral during the Battle for Helsinki, and the fleet sailed to Kronstadt during 10–13 April, due to 5 April German-Russian Hanko agreement. At first the Reds agreed to surrender and colonel ''von Tshirsky'' aimed to send a minor unit with a marching band and a movie group to symbolically free Helsinki. The Helsinki female Red Guard defended ''Vesilinna'', later [[Linnanmäki]]; the girls were crushed by the German naval artillery, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981b|pp=174–184}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=44–61}}, {{Harvnb|Pietiäinen|1992|pp=252–403}}, {{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=384–399}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2012|pp=7–47}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2013|pp=124–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 7,000 Finnish Reds defended [[Helsinki]], but their best troops fought on the  main fronts of the war. The main strongholds of the Red defence were the Workers Hall, the Railway station, the Red Headquarters of &quot;Smolna&quot; (the former palace of the Russian governor-general, in southern Esplanade), the Senate-[[Helsinki University|University]] area, and the former Russian garrisons in Helsinki. By the late evening of 12 April most of the major southern parts and all the western area of the city had been occupied by the Germans, who cleared the city house by house, street by street. Local Helsinki White Guards, hidden in the city during the war, joined the battle as the Germans advanced through the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981b|pp=174–184}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=44–61}}, {{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=384–399}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|Häikiö|1995|pp=100–102}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2013|pp=124–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April German troops took over the [[Market Square, Helsinki|Market Square]], &quot;Smolna&quot;, the Presidential Palace, and the Senate-[[Ritarihuone]] area. Toward the end, the ''Brigade Wolf'' with 2,000–3,000 soldiers joined the battle. The units rushed from north to the eastern parts of Helsinki, pushing into the working-class neighborhoods of [[Hermanni (Helsinki)|Hermanni]], [[Kallio]] and [[Sörnäinen]]. German artillery bombarded and destroyed the [[Helsinki Workers' Hall]], and put out the Red lantern of the Finnish revolution. The eastern parts of the town surrendered around 2 p.m., 13 April; a white flag was raised in the tower of the [[Kallio Church]], but sporadic fighting lasted until the evening. In total, 60 Germans, 300–400 Reds and 23 White Guard troopers were killed in the battle. Around 7,000 Reds were captured. The German army celebrated the victory and demonstrated the might with a major military parade in the centre of Helsinki on 14 April 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981b|pp=174–184}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=44–61}},{{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=384–399}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|Häikiö|1995|pp=100–102}}, {{Harvnb|Kolbe|Nyström|2008|pp=76–94}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2013|pp=124–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battles of Lahti====
''Brigade Brandenstein'' attacked towns of [[Kotka]] and [[Lahti]]. The Red Guards' strong defence in the former stalled the Germans' plan, but they took over Lahti on 19–20 April, in a mild battle. The German troops advanced from east-southeast; via Nastola, through Mustakallio graveyard in [[Salpausselkä]] and Russian garrisons of Hennala. Fierce battles, in the town and the surrounding area broke out between 22 April and 2 May 1918, as several thousand western Red Guard and Red civilian refugees tried to push through Lahti on their way to Russia. The German troops were able to hold major parts of the town and halt the Red advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=61–70}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|Häikiö|1995|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red and White terror===
[[File:FiringsquadLankipohja.jpg|thumb|300px|A White firing squad executing Red soldiers in Länkipohja, [[Längelmäki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993a|pp=130–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Whites and Reds perpetrated acts of political violence, called the ''Red terror'' and ''White terror'' of the 1918 war. The threshold of the violence had been crossed in the primarily peaceful Grand Duchy of Finland in the First Period of Russification 1899–1905; the Finnish Activists killed a Russian governor-general, police officers and a Finnish civil servant. World War I enhanced the potential of terror as it was widespread between the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Central Powers]]. The February Revolution initiated political violence in Finland; the Russian army common soldiers killed several Russian army officers in March 1917. The Finnish terror began in late summer as single killings, and the General Strike of November led to marked political violence; the Workers' Guards killed 27 Finns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=219–243}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen|et al.|1992|p=52}}, {{Harvnb|Uola|1998|pp=11–30}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two kinds of Red and White political violence: (i) a calculated part of the general warfare, (ii) local, personal murders and corresponding acts of revenge. In the former, the high staffs planned and organized the actions and gave orders to the lower level; at least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. At first the Red and White governments officially opposed political violence, but the operational decisions were made at the military level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tikka 2006 69–138&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=69–138}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72–84}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main goals of the terror was to destroy the power structure of the enemy, clear and secure the areas governed and occupied by the armies. Another goal was to create shock and fear among the civil population and the enemy soldiers. In the Finnish case, the common troopers' [[paramilitary]] nature and lack of combat skills, led to use political violence as a military weapon. The terror achieved some of the objectives, but also gave additional motivation to fight against an enemy perceived to be inhuman and cruel. The Red and White propaganda utilized the acts of the opponent effectively, which increased the local political violence and the spiral of revenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tikka 2006 69–138&quot;/&gt;

The number of casualties and the timing of the terror differed markedly between the Reds and Whites.

The level of killings by the Red Guards varied over the months because the Reds could never seize new areas outside Red Finland, they had to control industrialized southern Finland including majority of the Finnish establishment and eventually the Reds left Finland. The level of killings by the Whites varied over the months because they conquered southern Finland, and initially did not encounter marked resistance in White Finland. The comprehensive White terror started with the general offensive of the Whites in March 1918, increased constantly, culminated in the end of the war and ceased soon after the enemy had been sent to the prison camps.&lt;ref&gt;No Order by the highest Red Guard leadership to execute Red terror has been found. The tactical warfare-terror was probably led by mid-local level staffs. In February 1918, the White troops were given ''Instructions for Wartime Judicature'', later called [[Shoot on the Spot Declaration]] and a ''Desk of Securing Occupied Areas'' acted in the highest White staff, {{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1966|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1967|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Eerola|Eerola|1998|pp=59, 91}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004a|p=15}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=69-75, 103-104}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72–84}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Viipurin lääninvankila 1918.jpg|thumb|300px|White victims of Red terror at Viipuri county jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keskisarja|2013|pp=290–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Red Guards executed the Whites of economic/social power, including politicians, major landowners, industrialists, police officers, civil servants, teachers and leaders and members of the White Guards. Ten priests of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] and 90 (moderate) socialists were killed also. The two major centres of the terror were [[Toijala]] and [[Kouvola]]; 300–350 Whites were executed between February and April 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1966|pp=183–208}},  {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=105}}, {{Harvnb|Eerola|Eerola|1998|pp=59, 91}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004a|p=15}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=25–32, 69–100, 141–146, 157–158}}, {{Harvnb|Huhta|2009|pp=7–14}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White Guards executed Red Guard and party leaders, common Red troopers, socialist members of the Finnish parliament and local Red administration, and those active in the Red terror. During the peak of the terror, between the end of April and the beginning of May, 200 Reds were shot per day. The White political violence hit strong against the Russian soldiers who assisted the Finnish Reds and several Russian non-socialist civilians were executed in the aftermath of the Battle for Viipuri.&lt;ref&gt;The Red casualties included 300–500 female troopers. [[Sexual violence]] against women, Red females in particular, is a long-term [[taboo]]. Number of reliable literary sources is negligible, while the number of unreliable oral sources is high, {{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1967|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=121, 138}}, {{Harvnb|Eerola|Eerola|1998|pp=59, 91}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004a|p=15}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=25–32, 69–81, 103–138, 141–146, 157–158}}, {{Harvnb|Keskisarja|2013|pp=312–386}}, {{Harvnb|Lintunen|2014|pp=201–229}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the terror was undertaken by ''Flying Patrols''; [[cavalry]] units, consisting of 10 to 80 soldiers aged 15 to 20, under the absolute authority of an experienced adult leader. The detachments, specialiced in [[search and destroy|search-and-destroy]] operations behind the front lines and in the battles, were [[Death Squad]]s similar to German ''Sturmbattalions'' and Russian ''Assault units'' organized during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=19–38, 69–81, 141–152}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 1,650 Whites died in the ''Red terror'', while 10,000 Reds perished in the ''White terror'', which eventually became political cleansing. The White victims have been recorded exactly, but there is permanent uncertainty about the Red victims. It is unclear which of them died in the battles and which were executed immediately after the combats. Together with the prison camp experiences of the Reds in summer 1918, the political violence caused the deepest mental wounds and scars of the Civil War among the Finns, regardless of their political allegiance. Some of those, who carried out the terror were seriously traumatized, a phenomenon that was later to become well-documented.&lt;ref&gt;56 &quot;Red&quot; children, 11 girls, and 7 &quot;White&quot; children, 2 girls, were executed/killed outside battles. After 1918 a historical myth was composed; the victors' overall acts were legal, while those of the defeated faction were illegal. The modern historians prove that justification of civil war violence, on lawful and moral basis, by any side, leads to bias, distortion and decay of a society, {{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1966|pp=183–208}}, {{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1967|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=121, 138}}, {{Harvnb|Eerola|Eerola|1998|pp=59, 91}},  {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004a|p=15}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=19–30}}, {{Harvnb|Jyränki|2014|pp=150–188}}, {{Harvnb|Pekkalainen|2014|pp=49–68}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}, {{Harvnb|Kekkonen|2016|pp=106–166, 287–356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End===
After the defeat in Tampere and the German army invasion, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Viipuri on 8 April. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April 1918 ([[Edvard Gylling]] alone stood by his warriors). The escape of the Red leadership imbittered the Red troopers. Thousands of them, without true leadership, tried to flee to Russia, but most the refugees were besieged by the White and the German troops. The Reds surrendered on 1–2 May in the [[Lahti]] area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keränen et al. 1992 123–137&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=123–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long caravans of the Reds included women and children, who experienced a desperate, chaotic escape with several human losses due to the attacks of the enemy. It was a &quot;road of tears&quot; for the Reds, for the Whites the long enemy caravans heading east was a victorious scene. The Red Guards' last stronghold in south-east Finland, the area between [[Kouvola]] and [[Kotka]], fell by 5 May. The war of 1918 ended on 15 May, when the Whites took over [[Fort Ino|Ino]], a Russian [[coastal artillery]] base on the Karelian Isthmus, from the Russian troops. White Finland and General Mannerheim celebrated the victory with a large military parade in Helsinki on 16 May 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keränen et al. 1992 123–137&quot;/&gt;

The Red Guards had been defeated. The initially pacifist Finnish labour movement had lost the Civil War, several military leaders committed suicide and a majority of the Reds were sent to prison camps. The Vaasa Senate returned to Helsinki on 4 May 1918, but the capital was under the control of the German army. White Finland had become a protectorate of the German Empire. General [[Rüdiger von der Goltz]] was called &quot;the true Regent of Finland.&quot; No armistice or peace negotiations were carried out between the Whites and Reds, and an official peace treaty in order to end the Finnish Civil War was never signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=123–137}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=190–191}}, {{Harvnb|Kolbe|Nyström|2008|pp=144–155}}, {{Harvnb|Hentilä|Hentilä|2016|pp=11–14, 197–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bitter legacy===
The Civil War was a catastrophe for Finland; around 36,000 people, 1.2 percent of the nation's total population, perished. The war left about 15,000 children orphaned. As is often the case during (civil) war, most of the deaths occurred outside the battlefields, in the terror campaigns and from the appalling conditions in the prison camps. Many Reds fled to Russia at the end of the war and during the period that followed. The traumatic war deepened the divisions within Finnish society, many moderate-neutral Finns identifying themselves as &quot;citizens of two nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=447–481}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=9–13, 212–217}}, {{Harvnb|Peltonen|2003|pp=9–24, 214–220, 307–325}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=32–38, 209–223}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72–84}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}, ''[http://vesta.narc.fi/cgi-bin/db2www/sotasurmaetusivu/main?lang=en War victims in Finland 1914–1920]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The war of 1918 led to disintegration within both socialist and the non-socialist factions. The power political shift toward the right caused a dispute between conservatives and liberals on the best system of government for Finland to adopt: the former demanded monarchy and restricted parliamentarianism, the latter demanded a Finnish republic with full-scale democracy and social reforms. Both sides justified their views via political and legal grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vares 1998 38–115, 199–261&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=38–115, 199–261}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|2009|pp=376–394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarchists leaned on the Swedish regime's year 1772 monarchist constitution, belittled the Declaration of Independence 1917 and proposed a modernized monarchist constitution for Finland. The republicans argued that the 1772 law, accepted by Russia in 1809, lost validity in the February Revolution, the might of the Russian Czar was assumed by the Finnish Parliament on 15 November 1917 and Finnish republic was accepted on 6 December. The republicans were able to postpone processing of the monarchists' proposal in the parliament, and in the end a new monarchist constitution was not accepted in Finland. The monarchists responded by applying directly the 1772 law to select a new monarch for the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vares 1998 38–115, 199–261&quot;/&gt;

A major consequence of the 1918 conflict was the breakup of the Finnish labour movement into three parts: moderate Social Democrats and left-wing socialists in Finland, and communists acting in Soviet Russia with the support of the Bolsheviks. The Social Democratic Party had the first official party meeting after the civil war on 25 December 1918. The party proclaimed  commitment to parliamentary means and disclaimed Bolshevism and communism. The leaders of Red Finland, who had fled to Russia established the [[Communist Party of Finland]] in [[Moscow]] on 29 August 1918. After the power struggle of 1917 and the bloody civil war, the former Fennomans and Social Democrats, who had supported &quot;ultrademocratic&quot; means in Red Finland, declared to have committed to revolutionary Bolshevism-communism and to dictatorship of proletariat, under the control of V.I. Lenin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1973|pp=105–142}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=447–481}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=136, 149, 152, 159}}, {{Harvnb|Saarela|2014|pp=331–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rump Parliament.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Rump Parliament]] of Finland, Helsinki 1918. German army officers stand in the left corner. Social Democrat [[Matti Paasivuori]] is on the right, representing Finnish socialists alone.]]
A conservative-monarchist Senate was formed by [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|JK Paasikivi]] in May 1918. All members of the Parliament, who had taken part in the red uprising were removed from office. Eventually three Social Democrats continued there; the Parliament was called a &quot;Rump Parliament&quot;. In May 1918, the Senate asked the German troops to remain in Finland, but overall the 3 March Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the 7 March 1918 German-Finnish agreements bound White Finland to the power sphere of the German Empire. General Mannerheim resigned his post on 25 May after disagreements with the Senate about German hegemony over Finland, and about his planned attacks on Petrograd to repulse the Bolsheviks, and to capture Russian Karelia. The Germans opposed the attacks due to their peace treaties with Lenin, and other German outlines.&lt;ref&gt;The German vs. the Allies struggle in northwestern Russia, led to multiple military-political plans. An additional German-Russian peace treaty was signed on 27 August 1918; the Germans promised to keep the Finnish troops out of Petrograd-Russian Karelia but planned even an attack of a joint Bolshevik-White Finnish military squad against the British troops. The probable collapse of the weak Bolsheviks in the Russian civil war led to German ''Schlussstein''-plan; an offensive to seize Petrograd. The Finns were not informed of the outlines, {{Harvnb|Rautkallio|1977|pp=377–390}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=460–481}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=8–18, 87–92}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=136}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=122–129}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentilä|Nevakivi|1999|pp=121}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=190–191}}, {{Harvnb|Kolbe|Nyström|2008|pp=144–147}}, {{Harvnb|Roselius|2014|pp=119–155}}, {{Harvnb|Hentilä|Hentilä|2016|pp=210–215, 300–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 1918, under pressure by Germany, the Senate and Parliament elected a German prince, [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse|Friedrich Karl]], brother-in-law of German Emperor [[William II, German Emperor|William II]], to become the [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|King of Finland]]. Eventually, General [[Rüdiger von der Goltz]] was able to utilize the weakness of Finland for the power political benefit of the [[German Empire]]. All of these measures diminished Finnish sovereignty. The Finns, both right and left, had achieved independence on 6 December 1917 without a gunshot, but then compromised that independence by allowing the Germans to enter the country without difficulty during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rautkallio|1977|pp=377–390}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=8–18, 87–92}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=152}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=199–261}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=190–191, 276–291}}, {{Harvnb|Hentilä|Hentilä|2016|pp=197–203, 287–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic condition of the country had deteriorated so drastically that recovery to pre-conflict levels was not achieved until 1925. The most acute crisis was in the food supply, already deficient in 1917, though starvation had at that time been avoided in southern Finland. The Civil War, according to the leaders of Red Finland and White Finland, would solve all past problems; instead it led to starvation in southern Finland too. Late in 1918, Finnish politician [[Rudolf Holsti]] appealed for relief to [[Herbert Hoover]], the American chairman of the [[Committee for Relief in Belgium]]: Hoover arranged for food shipments and persuaded the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] to relax their blockade of the [[Baltic Sea]], which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, to allow the food in.&lt;ref&gt;The Finnish economy grew exceptionally rapidly between 1924 and 1939, despite a slow-down during the depression of 1929–1931, enhancing markedly the standard of living of majority of the Finns, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|p=157}}, {{Harvnb|Pietiäinen|1992|pp=252–403}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=9–13, 212–217}}, {{Harvnb|Saarikoski|2008|pp=115–131}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prison camps====
{{Main article|Finnish Civil War prison camps}}
[[File:Civil War Prison Camp in Helsinki.png|thumb|300px|A prison camp in [[Suomenlinna]], Helsinki. More than 11,000 people died in such camps due to hunger, disease, and executions.]]
The White Army and the German troops captured around 80,000 Red war [[prisoners]], including 5,000 women, 1,500 children and 8,000 Russians. The largest [[List of concentration and internment camps#Finland|prison camps]] were [[Suomenlinna]], an [[island]] facing [[Helsinki]], [[Hämeenlinna]], [[Lahti]], [[Riihimäki]], Tammisaari ([[Ekenäs (Finland)|Ekenäs]]), [[Tampere]] and  [[Vyborg|Viipuri]]. The Senate decided to keep the prisoners detained until each person's guilt could be investigated; a law for a ''Tribunal of Treason'' was enacted on 29 May 1918. The Tribunal did not meet all the standards of neutral [[justice]], due to the mental atmosphere of White Finland after the war. In total 76,000 cases were examined and 68,000 Reds were convicted, primarily for complicity to [[treason]]; 39,000 got out on [[parole]] and mean punishment of the rest was 2–4 years in ''penitentiary''. 555 people were sentenced to [[death]], of which 113 were executed. The trials revealed that also some [[innocent]] adults had been imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the nonguilty persons were White supporters or neutral Finns, taken by force to service of the Red Guards, and unable to immediately prove their attitude to the conflict, {{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1971}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=140, 142}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentilä|Nevakivi|1999|pp=112}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=161–178}}, {{Harvnb|Suodenjoki|2009b|pp=335–355}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72–84}}, {{Harvnb|Jyränki|2014|pp=177–188}}, {{Harvnb|Pekkalainen|2014|pp=84–244}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with the severe food shortage, the mass imprisonment led to high mortality rates in the camps, and the catastrophe was compounded by a mentality of punishment, anger and indifference on the part of the victors. Many prisoners felt that they were abandoned by their own leaders, who had fled to Russia. The physical and mental condition of the prisoners declined rapidly in May as food supplies had disrupted during the Red Guards' chaotic retreat in April, and a high number of Red prisoners had been sent to the less organized [[List of concentration and internment camps#Finland|prison camps]] already during the first half of April in Tampere and Helsinki. As a consequence, in June 2,900 starved to death or died as a result of diseases caused by malnutrition and [[Spanish flu]], 5,000 in July, 2,200 in August, and 1,000 in September. The mortality rate was highest in the [[Tammisaari prison camp|Tammisaari camp]] at 34 percent, while in the others the rate varied between 5 percent and 20 percent. In total around 13,000 Finns perished (3,000–4,000 due to Spanish influenza). The dead were buried in [[mass graves]] near the camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1971}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1992–1993}}, {{Harvnb|Eerola|Eerola|1998|pp=114, 121, 123}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004a|pp=115–150}}, {{Harvnb|Suodenjoki|2009b|pp=335–355}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the prisoners were paroled or pardoned by the end of 1918, after the change in the political situation. There were 6,100 Red prisoners left at the end of the year, 4,000 at the end of 1919 (3,000 pardoned in January 1920, at the same time civil rights were given back to 40,000 prisoners), 500 in 1923, and in 1927 the last 50 prisoners were pardoned by the Social Democratic government led by [[Väinö Tanner]]. In 1973, the Finnish government paid reparations to 11,600 persons imprisoned in the camps after the civil war. Several reasons for the long-term and relatively high support of communism in Finland can be found; for the civil war generation of the left, the traumatic hardships of the prison camps were decisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1973|pp=105–142}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=447–481}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentilä|Nevakivi|1999|p=112}}, {{Harvnb|Suodenjoki|2009b|pp=335–355}}, {{Harvnb|Saarela|2014|pp=331–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compromise===
As the fate of the Finns was decided outside Finland in Saint Petersburg on 15 March 1917, it was decided outside Finland again on 11 November 1918, in [[Berlin]], after Germany accepted defeat in World War I. The German Empire collapsed in the [[German Revolution of 1918-19]], caused by lack of food, war-weariness and defeat in the battles on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. [[Rüdiger von der Goltz]] and his squad left [[Helsinki]] on 16 December, and Prince Friedrich Karl, who had not yet been crowned, left his post on 20 December. Finland's status altered from a monarchist protectorate of the German Empire to an independent democratic republic, with a modernizing civil society. The system of government, the primary [[Constitution of Finland]], was confirmed on 17 July 1919.&lt;ref&gt;In terms of dates in history, Finnish independence symbolically a triangle or a three-pointed star, composed of 15 November and 6 December 1917, and 11 November 1918, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=447–481}}, {{Harvnb|Keränen et al.|1992|pp=67, 73, 154, 171}}, {{Harvnb|Jyränki|2014|pp=18–38}}, {{Harvnb|Hentilä|Hentilä|2016|pp=11–14, 323–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first local elections based on universal suffrage in the history of Finland were held during 17–28 December 1918, and the first parliamentary election after the Civil War on 3 March 1919. The United States and the United Kingdom recognised Finnish sovereignty on 6–7 May 1919. The Western powers demanded establishment of democratic republics in post-war Europe in order to calm down the widespread revolutionary movements in Europe. The Finnish-Russian [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian-Finnish)]] signed on 14 October 1920 aimed to stabilize the political relations and settle the border line between the former Grand Duchy and its mainland.&lt;ref&gt;In international politics, since 1920s Finland gradually became a subject, instead of merely being an object, {{Harvnb|Keränen|et al. 1992|pp=154, 171}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=243–256}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008c|pp=95–109}}, {{Harvnb|Kuisma|2010|pp=231–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Finnish Civil War Memorial Antrea.jpg|thumb|right|The Whites' memorial of the Civil War/Freedom War, in [[Kamennogorsk]] Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vapaussodanperinne.fi/Sivu724.htm|title=Vapaussodan Tampereen Seudun Perinneyhdistys ry|work=vapaussodanperinne.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In April 1918, the leading  Finnish [[social liberalism|social liberal]], the eventual first president of Finland, [[Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg]] wrote: &quot;It is urgent to get the life and development in this country back on the path that we had already reached in 1906 and which the turmoil of war turned us away from.&quot; A moderate Social Democrat, [[Väinö Voionmaa]] agonised in 1919: &quot;Those who still trust in the future of this nation must have an exceptionally strong faith. This young independent country has lost almost everything due to the war....&quot; He was a vital companion for the leader of the reformed Social Democratic Party, [[Väinö Tanner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=223–225, 243, 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Santeri Alkio]] supported moderate politics. His party colleague [[Kyösti Kallio]] urged in his ''Nivala address'' on 5 May 1918: &quot;We must rebuild a Finnish nation, which is not divided into the Reds and Whites....We have to establish a democratic Finnish republic, where all the Finns can feel that we are true citizens and members of this society.&quot; In the end, many of the moderate Finnish conservatives followed the thinking of [[Lauri Ingman]], who wrote in spring 1918: &quot;A political turn more to the right will not help us now, instead it would strengthen the support of socialism in this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ståhlberg, Ingman, Tokoi, and [[Miina Sillanpää]] with other moderate female politicians had desperately tried to avoid the war in January 1918 with a proposal for a new Senate including both non-socialist and socialist members, but they were run over, {{Harvnb|Hokkanen|1986}}, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=121–138}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=223–225, 243, 249}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=58, 96–99}}, {{Harvnb|Korppi-Tommola|2016|pp=99–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the other broad-minded Finns, the new partnership constructed a Finnish [[compromise]] which eventually delivered stable and broad parliamentary democracy. The compromise was based both on the defeat of the Reds in the 1918 war and the fact that most of the Whites' political goals had not been achieved. After the foreign forces left Finland, the militant factions of the Red and White lost their backup, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity, and the legacy of Fennomania, stood out among the Finns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=480–481}}, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1992|pp=228–249}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=97–99, 243–256}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2008|pp=255–261}},{{Harvnb|Haapala|2009a|pp=395–404}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2009b|pp=17–23}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|2009|pp=376–394}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2010|pp=174–182}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weakness of both Germany and Russia after World War I empowered Finland and made a peaceful, domestic Finnish social and political settlement possible. The reconciliation led to a slow and painful, but steady, national unification. In the end, the [[power vacuum]] and [[interregnum]] of 1917–1919 gave way to the Finnish compromise. From 1919 to 1991, the democracy and sovereignty of the Finns withstood challenges from right-wing and left-wing political radicalism, the crisis of World War II and pressure from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;The Civil War interfered and slowed down the Finnish modernization process, ongoing since the end of 19th century, as an interaction between industrialization, state formation, democratization, formation of a civil society and national independence. The process did not follow any long-term, grand plan made by the Finns or some others. Instead it was the result of reacting to and solving short-term international and domestic economical, political and social questions and problems, on the basis of the long-term history, structure and the way of living of the northern society formed between western and eastern Europe, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1992|pp=228–249}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=97–99, 243–256}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2008|pp=255–261}}, {{Harvnb|Saarikoski|2008|pp=115–131}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2009a|pp=395–404}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2009b|pp=17–23}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|2009|pp=376–394}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1918 and the 1950s, mainstream literature and poetry presented the 1918 war from the point of view of the White victors, e.g., &quot;Psalm of the Cannons&quot; ({{lang-fi|Tykkien virsi}}) by Arvi Järventaus in 1918. In poetry, [[Bertel Gripenberg]], who had volunteered for the White army, celebrated its cause in &quot;The Great Age&quot; (Swedish: Den stora tiden) in 1928 and [[V.A. Koskenniemi]] in &quot;Young Anthony&quot; (Finnish: Nuori Anssi) in 1918. The war tales of the Reds' were kept in silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Varpio|2009|pp=441–463}}, {{Harvnb|Tepora|2014|pp=390–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first neutral-critical books were written soon after the war: &quot;Devout Misery&quot; (Finnish: Hurskas kurjuus) written by the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate in Literature]] [[Frans Emil Sillanpää]] in 1919, &quot;Dead [[Apple]] trees&quot; (Finnish: Kuolleet omenapuut) by [[Joel Lehtonen]] in 1918 and &quot;Home coming&quot; (Swedish: Hemkomsten) by [[Runar Schildt]] in 1919. They were followed by [[Jarl Hemmer]] in 1931 with the book &quot;A man and his conscience&quot; (Swedish: En man och hans samvete) and Oiva Paloheimo in 1942 with &quot;Restless childhood&quot; (Finnish: Levoton lapsuus). [[Lauri Viita]]'s book &quot;Scrambled ground&quot; (Finnish: Moreeni) from 1950, presented life and experiences of a worker family in Tampere in 1918, including a point of view of outsiders in the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;''Runar Schildt'' committed suicide in 1925, partly due to the Civil War, in 1920 he wrote: &quot;The bugle will not call me and the people of my kind to assemble. We have no place in the White and Red Guards of this life, no fanatic war-cry, no place in the column, no permanent place to stay, no peace of mind. Not for us&quot;, {{Harvnb|von Bagh|2007|pp=15–55}}, {{Harvnb|Varpio|2009|pp=441–463}}, {{Harvnb|Tepora|2014|pp=390–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1959 and 1962, [[Väinö Linna]], in his trilogy &quot;[[Under the North Star]]&quot; (Finnish: Täällä Pohjantähden alla), described the Civil War and World War II from the point of view of the common people. Part II of Linna's work markedly opened the larger view and the tales of the Reds in the 1918 war, and it had a significant mental effect in [[Finland]]. At the same time, a new point of view for the war was opened by the books of [[Paavo Haavikko]] &quot;Private matters&quot;(Finnish: Yksityisiä asioita), by [[Veijo Meri]] &quot;The events of 1918&quot; (Finnish: Vuoden 1918 tapahtumat) and Paavo Rintala &quot;My [[grandmother]] and Mannerheim&quot; (Finnish: Mummoni ja Mannerheim), all published in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;The trilogy of ''Väinö Linna''  affected history research, while many Finns began to interpret e.g. the Part II as &quot;the historical truth&quot; for the events of 1918. Historians have shown the book's main distortions; e.g. the role of crofters is emphasized too much and the role of social liberals and other moderate non-socialists is neglected, but they do not diminish the high value of the trilogy in the Finnish literature, {{Harvnb|von Bagh|2007|pp=15–55}}, {{Harvnb|Varpio|2009|pp=441–463}}, {{Harvnb|Tepora|2014|pp=390–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In poetry [[Viljo Kajava]], who had experienced the horrors of the [[Battle of Tampere]] at the age of nine, presented a pacifist view of the civil war in his &quot;Poems of Tampere 1918&quot; (Finnish: Tampereen runot) in 1966. The similar point of view, in the same battle, is emphasized in the novel &quot;Corpse bearer&quot; (Finnish: Kylmien kyytimies) by [[Antti Tuuri]] from 2007. Väinö Linna's trilogy turned the general tide, and several books were written mainly from the point of view of the Red side in 1918: e.g. ''Tampere''-trilogy by Erkki Lepokorpi in 1977, &quot;John&quot; (Finnish: Juho) by Juhani Syrjä in 1998 and &quot;The Command&quot; (Finnish: Käsky) by [[Leena Lander]] in 2003. [[Kjell Westö]]'s epic novel &quot;[[Where We Once Went]]&quot; (Swedish: Där vi en gång gått) published in 2006 deals with period of 1915-1930, from both the Red and the White point of views. Kjell Westö's book  &quot;Mirage 38&quot; (Swedish: Hägring 38)  from 2013 describes Finnish pre-World War II mental atmosphere and post-war traumas of the 1918 war. F.E. Sillanpää's, Väinö Linna's, Lauri Viita's, Jarl Hemmer's, Paavo Rintala's, Leena Lander's and Kjell Westö's stories have been utilized in motion picture and in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Kjell Westö was awarded [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] 2014 for his work Hägring 38, {{Harvnb|von Bagh|2007|pp=15–55}}, {{Harvnb|Varpio|2009|pp=441–463}}, {{Harvnb|Tepora|2014|pp=390–400}}, {{Harvnb|Helsingin Sanomat 29.10.2014.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
