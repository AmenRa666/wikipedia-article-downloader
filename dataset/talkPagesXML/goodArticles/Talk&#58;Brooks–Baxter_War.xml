Need: 
1868 Arkansas constitution

==older entries==
I noticed that there was nothing in the article about the state being forbidden from deficit spending due partially to the conflict, so I added the last paragraph.
--[[User:206.255.185.237|206.255.185.237]] 03:52, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Sorry, but you're incorrect.  There has NEVER been a provision in the Arkansas Constitution of 1874 banning deficit spending by the STATE (though Amendment 1 repudiated the Holford Bonds in the 1880's).  Although the 1874 Constitution DID try to ban deficit spending by cities and counties, even that was ineffective until Amendment 10 in 1924 expressly banned local deficits.  State deficit spending IS banned by law, however, though it was ignored until the first Revenue Stabilization Law was passed in 1945; those laws have effectively ended deficit spending by cutting cash flow to state agencies during budgetary shortfalls. --[[User:70.232.40.250|70.232.40.250]] 05:32, January 27, 2006 (UTC)

I have added a lot of stuff to this article. I used large portion of a research paper I did on the war for one of my college courses. You can read that paper [[User:The stuart/Brooks-Baxter War paper|here]]. --[[User:The stuart|The_stuart]] 23:41, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

==GA Review==
At the moment, this article has no chance. Below is a list of the more obvious problems. Once these are fixed, bring it back to GA and renominate it, but don't come back without having them done as the article will just fail all over again.
#The lead is a mess. Please edit it into two tight paragraphs explaining as simply as possible the context and effects this incident had and indicate whay it is exceptional or notable.
#Sources. Here is the biggest problem. Swathes of the article, including whole paragraphs, are unsourced. For a GA, there should be at least one inline citation per paragraph and more on any controversial statements or statistics. This article is not only grossly undercited, but many of the citations are presented in raw URLs which must be changed (see [[WP:CITE]]). There are {{Tl|Fact}} tags and a clean-up tag at the top.
#The text is scattered by weasel words and poor grammar, although there is good use of images and quotes.

Please give this article a thorough copyedit and clean up the sourcing before bringing it back to GA.--[[User:Jackyd101|Jackyd101]] ([[User talk:Jackyd101|talk]]) 14:25, 18 January 2008 (UTC)

==Sources need improvement==
The article relies heavily on only a couple of sources and period journalism; some third-party scholarly sources would be useful for perspective.--[[User:Parkwells|Parkwells]] ([[User talk:Parkwells|talk]]) 19:52, 16 May 2008 (UTC)

==POV==
Based on reading even AR Encyclopedia articles, the reliance on Gazette makes this seriously flawed and POV.  I've started to rewrite it with additional material and cites, but it needs more work. --[[User:Parkwells|Parkwells]] ([[User talk:Parkwells|talk]]) 21:10, 16 May 2008 (UTC)

==Refs==
I was messing with the references and something weird happened. It appears to have captured one of the old quotes I pulled out of microfilm. I've played with it a while and can't figure out what the problem is, may be someone else can. --[[User:The stuart|The_stuart]] ([[User talk:The stuart|talk]]) 02:01, 15 September 2008 (UTC)

== continuing issues ==

As I was going through the bibliography, Sandy archived the thread.  The article has merit, it is just not up to snuff yet.  The citations were difficult to follow, although i fixed the Appleton's cites.  The newspaper articles need proper citation (paper (location), article, date, page).  See the MOS for specific citation styles.  [[User:Auntieruth55|Auntieruth55]] ([[User talk:Auntieruth55|talk]]) 00:14, 18 October 2009 (UTC)
==Tag==
I suspect that the clear POV running through this article merely reflects the POV of the sources; really, one should not write on Reconstruction with sources dating only up to 1922. For more, see my comments at FAC. If one must use contemporary sources, at least balance them; isn't the ''Chicago Tribune'' available on line?  [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Pmanderson|PMAnderson]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:45, 11 November 2009 (UTC)
::If you can find a Chicago Tribune article on the Brooks-Baxter War I would be more than happy to consider it. http://www.chicagotribune.com/search/dispatcher.front?Query=brooks-baxter+war&amp;target=article&amp;sortby=display_time+descending
--[[User:The stuart|The_stuart]] ([[User talk:The stuart|talk]]) 22:31, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

==Composition of Forces==
The article states that &quot;Baxter's forces, all white Democrats, continued to grow steadily during the conflict...&quot;
There's an interesting primary source contradicting this in the Work Project Administration's &quot;Slave Narratives: a Folk History of Slavery in the United States&quot;, in the interview of R.B. Anderson, cf. http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11255/11255-h/11255-h.htm#AndersonRB where he (as a contemporary witness to events) describes African-Americans fighting on both sides of the conflict, and seems (on my reading) to take Baxter's side: &quot;I remember the King White fooled a lot of niggers and armed them and brought them up here. The niggers and Republicans here fought them and run them back where they come from.&quot; -- Benjamin Rosenbaum, 16:36, 29. August 212 (UTC)

== Rockefeller ==

If he is relevant at all it should be mentioned that Republicans both supported and voted for the 1965 voting rights act, and that he wasn't a segregationist; far from it he defeated the segregationist James Johnson. Many people even consider the democratic nominee who faced Rockefeller to have been one of the last viable segregationist politicians; his defeat was the end of an era and start of a new one; not an endorsement of segregation.

I will edit it right now to reflect historical accuracy, the defeat of one of the last segregationists was not a victory for segregation and the article shouldn't pretend it is.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.56.186.182|108.56.186.182]] ([[User talk:108.56.186.182|talk]]) 22:06, 4 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Assessment comment==
{{Substituted comment|length=953|lastedit=20090820165434|comment=I've made some corrections of my own, but I haven't the time nor interest to give this article proper attention.  That and I can say I had no knowledge of the event in question before seeing this article today.  Anyway, I don't think it's quite up to A-class par yet.  It's very well developed content-wise, though it needs more copy-editing.  I noted and corrected a half-dozen typos and grammatical quirks in the opening paragraph alone.  Can't say as far as references go, though at the very least there appeared to be frequent citations for the most part.  Lastly, it probably needs someone more familiar with the manual of style guidelines to go through it.
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, I see that it is currently a GA candidate.  I suppose based on the outcome of that assessment the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Arkansas|WikiProject Arkansas]] rating can adjust accordingly.
