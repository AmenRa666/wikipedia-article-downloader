The '''Eurocopter AS565 Panther''' is the military version of the [[Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin]] medium-weight multi-purpose twin-engine [[helicopter]]. The Panther is used for a wide range of military roles, including combat assault, fire support, anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, search and rescue, and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC).

==Development==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
During the 1980s, French aerospace firm [[Aerospatiale]] decided to develop a purpose-built military version of their popular [[Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin]]. The civil SA365 N variant of the Dauphin was used as the starting point for the project; the new rotorcraft was designed to perform utility, [[Anti-tank warfare#Helicopters|anti-tank]], troop-transport, and maritime operations.&lt;ref name = &quot;mcgowen 163&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;FI 1986&quot;/&gt; On 28 February 1984, the military variant prototype, designated as the AS365M and later named Panther, conducted its first flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;brassey&quot; /&gt; A total of three prototypes were built.&lt;ref name = &quot;FI 1986&quot;/&gt;

In May 1986, Aerospatiale formally launched production of the AS365M, at which point the firm anticipated more than 400 Panthers to be sold in the long term.&lt;ref name = &quot;FI 1986&quot;&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1986/1986%20-%201025.html &quot;Aerospatiale unleashes Panther.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 10 May 1986. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial production model, which was initially designated as the AS365 K, was shortly re-designated and became widely known as the AS565 Panther.&lt;ref name = &quot;mcgowen 163&quot;&gt;McGowen 2005, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Early models were powered by a pair of [[Turbomeca Arriel|Turbomeca Arriel 1M1]] [[turboshaft]] engines; in 1995, [[Eurocopter]] began offering higher powered versions of the Panther that used the new [[Turbomeca Arriel|Turbomeca Arriel 2C]] engine instead.&lt;ref name = &quot;FI 1995&quot;&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%201918.html &quot;More power for Naval Panther.&quot;] ''Flight International'', June 1995. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Airbus Helicopters promised to relocate the global production line for the AS565 Panther to India if it is selected by the [[Indian Navy]] for a proposed utility helicopter acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Dominic. [https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/singapore-airbus-helicopters-targets-asian-sales-ex-422232/ &quot;SINGAPORE: Airbus Helicopters targets Asian sales expansion.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 22 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanjai, P.R.

[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-helicopters-advances-panther-mbe-deliveries-424020/ &quot;Airbus Helicopters advances Panther MBe deliveries.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 8 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:BMS 005.jpg|thumb|Multiple AS565 Panthers in various states of assembly, 2004]]
The AS565 Panther is a twin-engine medium-sized multi-mission rotorcraft. It is capable of performing various naval and land-based missions, such as [[maritime security]], [[search and rescue]] (SAR), [[casualty evacuation]] (CASEVAC), [[vertical replenishment]], [[surveillance]], [[special forces|special forces operation]]s, [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) and [[Anti-surface warfare]] (ASuW).&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus mbe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;helib broch&quot;/&gt; The Panther is powered by a pair of [[Turbomeca Arriel]] [[turboshaft]] engines, which drives the rotorcraft's main rotor as well as the [[fenestron]] anti-torque tail rotor device.&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus mbe&quot;&gt;[https://www.airbushelicopters.com/website/docs_wsw/pdf/AS565%20MBe/AS565MBe-MP-1214E.pdf &quot;AS565 MBe.&quot;] ''Airbus Helicopters'', Retrieved: 8 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;north 31&quot;&gt;Northham 1987, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The flight profile of the Panther has been described as being easy to manoeuver, possessing generous [[g-force]] limitations and a high level of stability.&lt;ref&gt;Northham 1987, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the commando-transport configuration, the Panther may carry up to 10 fully armed soldiers on board at a time in addition to the two pilots flying the aircraft.&lt;ref name = &quot;north 30&quot;/&gt; The main cabin can be rapidly reconfigured to conduct various roles, such as troop-transport, SAR, and MEDIVAC missions; optional equipment includes a full medical suite, [[forward-looking infrared]] (FLIR) camera, emergency flotation, [[loudspeaker]], variable-speed hoist, cargo sling, [[search light]], and a stretcher-support structure.&lt;ref name = &quot;helib broch&quot;/&gt;

Various avionics are present upon the Panther; some variants are fitted with the advanced human-machine interface (HMI) [[glass cockpit]]. It features the vehicle and engine multifunction display (VEMD), integrated electronic standby instrument (ESI), usage monitoring system (UMS), [[traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS), [[terrain awareness and warning system]] (H-TAWS), and dedicated mission display coupled with a multi-sensor processor, a 4-axis [[Aircraft flight control system|automatic flight control system]] (AFCS), [[flight management system]] (FMS), and an advanced [[Radar configurations and types#Detection and search radars|search radar]].&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus mbe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;helib broch&quot;/&gt; The design of the cockpit and avionics systems, such as the engine management system, provides a high level of automation as part of an effort to reduce workload upon the pilots.&lt;ref name = &quot;north 32&quot;&gt;Northham 1987, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The cockpit was deliberately designed with extra panel space to accommodate future upgrades and additional instrumentation that may be installed.&lt;ref name = &quot;north 30&quot;/&gt;

The principle element of ASW-configured Panthers is the Helicopter Long-Range Active Sonar (HELRAS), a [[Sonar#Aircraft|dipping sonar]] equipped with a descending array of seven projection elements and a receiving array equipped with eight extending arms, which is capable of detecting submarines up to 500 meters below the water's surface.&lt;ref name = &quot;defense 2014&quot;/&gt; According to Airbus Helicopters, the Panther family has been qualified to operate from the flight decks of over 100 classes of [[NATO]] vessels, and complies with NATO standardization agreements.&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus maritime&quot;&gt;[https://www.airbushelicopters.com/website/en/ref/Maritime_66.html &quot;Aircraft: Light and medium helicopters.&quot;] ''Airbus Helicopters'', Retrieved: 7 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The compact size of the Panther has enabled the type to be operated from smaller ocean-going vessels such as [[corvette]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;defense 2014&quot;/&gt; To aid in shipboard landings under rough sea conditions and high winds, some variants can be furnished with the hydraulic ''Harpoon'' deck-lock securing device.&lt;ref name = &quot;helib broch&quot;&gt;[https://www.helibras.com.br/wp-content/themes/duesc/extras/pdf/AS565MB.pdf &quot;AS565MB.&quot;] ''Helibras'', Retrieved: 8 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panther can be armed with several different sets of munitions and armaments, dependent upon the intended role. Munitions include 20mm pod-mounted [[Cannon#Aircraft use|cannon]]s, 68mm rocket pods, a maximum of eight [[Mistral (missile)|Mistral]] [[air-to-air missile]]s, or a maximum of eight [[HOT (missile)|HOT]] [[anti-tank missile]]s; all of which can be mounted onto a universal weapon support beam.&lt;ref name = &quot;north 30&quot;/&gt; The weapon systems are integrated with a Crouzet HDH-2A electronic sight and the autopilot, the latter of which provides automatic flight handling assistance during weapons deployment to avoid negative tendencies such as nose droop.&lt;ref name = &quot;north 30&quot;/&gt; For improved survivability, the [[radar signature]] is reduced due to the use of [[composite materials]] across the airframe and the use of the fenestron tail rather than a conventional tail rotor; low [[infrared]] paints are also typically applied to the exterior surfaces and jet exhaust dilution devices are installed on the engines to reduce the Panther's infrared signature. Damage resistance is increased by the adoption of [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s and armor-plated crew seating.&lt;ref name = &quot;north 30&quot;&gt;Northham 1987, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational History==

The [[French Naval Aviation]] took delivery of 15 Panthers between 1993 and 1998 for maritime operations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Strategic Digest.&quot; ''Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses'', 1993. Volume 23, Issues 1–6 p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to increasing acts of [[piracy]] in the [[Gulf of Aden]], since 2008, Panthers have been routinely dispatched upon multiple French frigates that have conducted deployments in support of [[Operation Atalanta]], a long term pan-European counter-piracy operation. In the Aden, the Panther has been typically used for maritime patrol, surveillance and troop-transport missions, such as the transportation of strike teams and the retrieval of detainees.&lt;ref&gt;Whittle, Richard.

In May 2009, France announced a major mid-life upgrade program for the Aeronavale's Panther fleet, focused on cockpit upgrades and improved defensive/offensive equipment. The additions and alterations include a new [[glass cockpit]] compatible with [[night vision goggles]] (NVG), [[electro-optics|electro-optical]] sensors, a new anti-jamming radio, [[Link 11]] data-link, and a self-protection system based on that used on the [[Eurocopter Tiger]].&lt;ref&gt;Kieran, Daly.

In 1988, the [[Brazilian Army Aviation Command]] took delivery of its first Panther helicopter, which was produced locally by [[Helibras]]. In January 2010, Helibras was awarded a contact to upgrade 34 AS365K Panthers to the new AS365 K2 standard.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, Craig.
