== Birthplace discrepancy ==
According to the FBI at [https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/hollow-nickel/ &quot;Rudolph Ivanovich Abel (Hollow Nickel Case)&quot;], Abel was not born in the UK, but rather:
{{quote|&quot;Mark&quot; [Collins or simply &quot;MARK&quot;] made another admission—that he was a Russian citizen, Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, born July 2, 1902 in the Soviet Union. Although he refused to discuss his intelligence activities, the photo studio and hotel room which he occupied were virtual museums of modern espionage equipment. They contained shortwave radios, cipher pads, cameras and film for producing microdots, a hollow shaving brush, cuff links, and numerous other &quot;trick&quot; containers.}}

We need to address this discrepancy, particularly since this FBI page already in among this article's footnotes. --[[User:Tenebrae|Tenebrae]] ([[User talk:Tenebrae|talk]]) 19:50, 4 October 2015 (UTC)
::There is no discrepancy regarding Vilyam &quot;Willie&quot; Genrikhovich Fisher's birthplace and birthdate. You are confusing the &quot;real&quot; Rudolf Ivanovich Abel with a story fabricated by Fisher when questioned by the FBI in 1957, that he was a Russian living under false identities and gave his real name that of a deceased friend and KGB colleague, Rudolf Ivanovich Abel. The Centre, Fisher knew, would realize he had been arrested as soon as it saw the name Abel on the front page of the American newspapers. The name &quot;Abel&quot; stuck. [[User:Adamdaley|Adamdaley]] ([[User talk:Adamdaley|talk]]) 01:16, 10 October 2015 (UTC)

== Capture ==
The last sentence in the fourth paragraph is inaccurate: 
:During this period Fisher stated that his real name was Rudolf Ivanovich Abel and that he was a Soviet citizen, although he refused to discuss his intelligence activities. By stating his real name, Fisher was trying to send a covert signal to Moscow to let them know that he had been captured.
According to &quot;The Spy of Cadman Plaza&quot; by Nathan Ward, published in the New York Times on April 24, 2009:
:When he was caught in 1957, he identified himself as Rudolph Ivanovich Abel; that was the name of a dead K.G.B. colonel.
So if Abel was trying to send a signal to Moscow, he was not doing so by stating his real name. I am adding a sentence prior to and recrafting the last sentence as follows:
&quot;Rudolf Ivanovich Abel&quot; was the name of a deceased KGB colonel.&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/nyregion/thecity/26spy.html |title=&quot;The Spy of Caman Plaza&quot; |last1=Ward |first1=Nathan |date=24 April 2009 |website=www.NYTimes.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |access-date=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; By stating this name, Fisher was trying ...

== Real Name? ==
Why is his &quot;real name&quot; Vilyam &quot;Willie&quot; Genrikhovich Fisher? He was born William August Fisher. Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher is a Russian version of his name. He was famous as Rudolf Abel, and the Soviet postage stamp, in fact, calls him Abel. Who actually called him Vilyam Genrikovich Fisher?--[[User:Jack Upland|Jack Upland]] ([[User talk:Jack Upland|talk]]) 09:04, 28 October 2015 (UTC)

::Though born in United Kingdom he was of mixed German and Russian blood. When he was formally employed by the OGPU he was asked:

::&quot;In this document you say that you're German. Here you say your Russian. Here British. What are you?&quot;

::&quot;I don't know what I am according to your rules. I'll be whatever you say I am.&quot;

::&quot;You're Russian.&quot;

:As far as the Soviet Union were concerned William August Fisher became Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher.
:Arthey, Vin. (2004). p. 73. ''Like Father Like Son: A Dynasty of Spies''. St. Ermin's Press in association with Little Brown. London. ISBN 1-903608-07-4. [[User:Adamdaley|Adamdaley]] ([[User talk:Adamdaley|talk]]) 03:12, 31 October 2015 (UTC)

: A &quot;W&quot; (Cyrillic В) is pronounced more like the English &quot;V&quot; (Cyrillic У). It would be more common to pronounce the name as the English &quot;Villy&quot;. 
The English Name &quot;William Wordsworth&quot; spelled in Cyrillic is &quot;Уильям Вордсворт&quot; but spoken in Russian as &quot;Уильям Уордсуорт&quot;.
Also, as he is more ethnic German his 'real surname' would be spelled &quot;Fischer&quot;, having been changed to 'Fisher' after immigrating to UK to anglicize the spelling. 
THE REAL question is why the use of the &quot;Abel&quot; name - If his real name and codename are &quot;Fisher&quot;? - I can find no clue to source of Abel in the Russian and/or German Interwiki either, just seems to magically appear.

== Recent Changes..... ==
Rudolf Abel article (formally entitled Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher), an &quot;A-Class&quot; article since July 22nd, 2012. Has successfully met the five criteria of the Military History &quot;A-Class&quot; Assessment. See link for more information: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Military_history/Assessment/A-Class]. With the release of the movie, the &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;, it appears some people feel compelled to make unnecessary edits on Rudolf Abel. It is important to note that any &quot;edits&quot; concerning references can either affect the referencing, or result in an error being placed in the references section. I am prepared to welcome any constructive edits, however the deletion of an entire section, referring to [[Reino Häyhänen]] is not only a mystery to me. Häyhänen is critical to the eventual capture of Rudolf Abel in 1957 by the FBI. [[User:Adamdaley|Adamdaley]] ([[User talk:Adamdaley|talk]]) 02:21, 17 October 2015 (UTC)
:And the influence of Häyhänen on Abel's capture is preserved. What was included was a lot of cruft having ''nothing whatever'' to do with Abel. Put it on Häyhänen's page, where it belongs.

::[[User:Trekphiler|Trekphiler]] – As Fisher was ordered to reactivate the &quot;Volunteer&quot; network in the United States, why wouldn't the codenames of the said network be relevant? [[User:Adamdaley|Adamdaley]] ([[User talk:Adamdaley|talk]]) 06:48, 17 October 2015 (UTC)
:::Because you're naming the people, who have their own pages. Notice, where they aren't linked to, I've left them in.  [[User:Trekphiler|&lt;font face=&quot;cursive&quot; color=&quot;#9400D3&quot;&gt;TREKphiler&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Trekphiler|&lt;font face=&quot;cursive&quot; color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;any time you're ready, Uhura&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 18:49, 17 October 2015 (UTC)
::::In 2010, I came across an unfinished page entitled Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher. After purchasing, reading and cross referencing fourteen books, I finished the page. This was never intended to be &quot;Rudolf Abel's&quot; page, as the aforesaid did not exist until Fisher was captured and provided the FBI with this alias. Fisher would never have achieved notoriety had it not been for Häyhänen's involvement and eventual defection. I do not agree the passages you chose to delete had no relevance. No other contributors appear to have a problem with this page. There are ways to communicate civilly without labelling another's work as &quot;JUNK&quot;. [[User:Adamdaley|Adamdaley]] ([[User talk:Adamdaley|talk]]) 08:36, 26 October 2015 (UTC)
:::::More power to you for finishing the page. That doesn't mean all the assorted trivia ''having nothing whatever to do with Fisher'' isn't still junk. That Fisher became notorious because of somebody else ''does not'' mean Häyhänen's troubles or stupid behavior belongs ''on this page''. Since they're ''his'' actions, they belong, if anywhere, on ''his own page''. More to the point, I see no valid rationale whatever for including the codenames of people ''who have their own pages'' &amp; comments about Cohen ''who has her own page''. I don't see you explaining, &amp; since you want it in, it's incumbent on you.

::::::G'day, all, I think in some ways Trekphiller has a valid point. Some of the information could be better placed in other articles; this would help keep the narrative more tightly focused on Abel (starting a page on Hayhanen is a good step in this direction, I think). That said, I certainly wouldn't label the work as &quot;junk&quot;. Such sentiments are not conducive to fostering a collaborative work environment. Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 09:40, 26 November 2015 (UTC)
:::::::I disagree. This isn't an overly long page. Häyhänen's story is vital to Fisher's story. I don't understand Trekphiler's compulsion to delete this stuff.--[[User:Jack Upland|Jack Upland]] ([[User talk:Jack Upland|talk]]) 10:27, 26 November 2015 (UTC)
::::::::{{u|Trekphiler}} – With your recent edit on November 26, 2015 on Rudolf Abel, do you think you have made a positive contribution towards the overall article? [[User:Adamdaley|Adamdaley]] ([[User talk:Adamdaley|talk]]) 03:00, 29 November 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::I hope so. I'm not opposed to any mention of Häyhänen; I get how important his screw-ups were. What's not on-point to ''Fisher'' is everything else about Häyhänen, the Cohens, the lives of the people whose identities were stolen, &amp; the codenames. Taking that out, IMO, sharpens the focus on the subject of the page, namely Fisher. What I can't understand is the mania for including it when it has nothing at all to do with him.  The issue isn't page length, it's being on-topic.

== Linguist? ==
''A skilled linguist - a native English speaker, as well as Russian and German from his parents and French from Monkseaton Grammar School - he got a job as a translator.&quot; says Arthey'' Speaking four languages or being good at learning languages doesn't make someone a linguist.

Which version of the opening paragraph should be kept in the early life section? Please have your say below All Hallow's Wraith paragraph.

:''Fisher was born William August Fisher on July 11, 1903, in [[Benwell]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[United Kingdom]], the second son of Heinrich and Lyubov Fisher. Revolutionaries of the [[Tsarist]] era; his father was an ethnic [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|German from Russia]] and his mother was of Russian descent.''

::{{u|Auntieruth55}} – Why are people quickly to jump to change the paragraph rather than trying to workout if their parents names should be included in the text or not? [[User:Adamdaley|Adamdaley]] ([[User talk:Adamdaley|talk]]) 22:28, 15 December 2015 (UTC)

: I don't have a strong opinion either way, but think a third option (i.e. compromise) is probably the best as there seems to advantages in both proposals. I understand Adam's point re them being married so don't have an issue with that form being maintained in-principle (assuming this is supported by the refs). However, as Hawkeye7 says it is standard in biographies to include maiden names in the text - as far as I've seen this is usually given in brackets (e.g. &quot;(née X&quot;)) although I'm unsure what the conventions were at the time. Equally as Peacemaker67 says if its in the infobox it probably should be in the text and ref'd there.

::::The sentence in question with the parents' names have been written for a &quot;flow&quot; affect. ''the second son of Heinrich and Lyubov Fisher.'' Which of course no-one has ever brought up or even noticed before. Compared to ''the second son of Lyubov Vasilyevna (Zhidova) and Heinrich Matthäus Fisher.'' Which is a god damn mouthful to say and is of course unreferenced with the names. As I referenced the names before this got changed.

== Accent ==
On [[Talk:Bridge of Spies (film)#Section on Inaccuracies?]] there has been a discussion about the accuracy of the portrayal of Abel's accent in the film.  In the course of that [[user:Sam Blacketer]] links to sources for Abel's accent: logically there could be a section here on Abel's accent.
