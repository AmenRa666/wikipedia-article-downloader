[[File:SS 'Wandle' (1932) under Southwark Bridge, London.jpg|thumb|305px|''Wandle'' on her maiden voyage, 30 October 1932, on the Thames under [[Southwark Bridge]]. Her mast, funnel and wheelhouse are folded flat to pass under the bridge]]

'''SS ''Wandle''''' was a British [[Coastal trading vessel|coastal]] [[Collier (ship)|collier]] owned and operated by the proprietors of [[Wandsworth]] [[gas works]] in south-west London. She was a [[Flatiron (ship)|flatiron]], meaning that she had a low-profile superstructure, hinged funnel, hinged or telescopic mast and folding [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]] to enable her to pass under low bridges on the tidal [[River Thames]] upriver from the [[Pool of London]]. She was in service from 1932 to 1959&lt;ref name=Burntisland/&gt; and survived a number of enemy attacks in the [[World War II|Second World War]].

==Namesakes==
SS ''Wandle'' was named after the [[River Wandle]], which flows through much of district that Wandsworth gas works then served and joins the Thames at [[Wandsworth]] near the company's gas works and headquarters. She was the third flatiron of the same name in the service of the same owners.&lt;ref name=COI-53-54&gt;Central Office of Information, 1947, pages 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; The first was built in 1909 and survived an engagement with a [[U-boat#World War I|U-boat]] in 1916. The second was built in 1922 and sold to [[Stephenson Clarke Shipping|Stephenson Clarke and Associates]] in 1932.&lt;ref name=Burntisland/&gt;

In the Second World War ''Wandle''{{'}}s [[Captain (nautical)|Master]] was G.A.W. Mastin, whose father G.E.A. Mastin had commanded the first SS ''Wandle'' when she repulsed a U-boat attack in 1916.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt;

==Building and civilian service==
The [[Burntisland Shipbuilding Company]] of [[Burntisland]] on the [[Firth of Forth]] in [[Fife]], Scotland, built ''Wandle'' in 1932 for the [[Wandsworth and District Gas Company]].&lt;ref name=LR33/&gt; She had four corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of {{convert|66|sqft|0}} that heated one single-ended boiler with a heating surface of {{convert|2850|sqft|0}}. This fed steam at 200 [[Pounds per square inch|lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] to a three-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple expansion steam engine]] built by North East Marine Engineering Co of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. The engine was rated at 164 [[Horsepower#Nominal horsepower|NHP]] and drove a single [[Propeller|screw]].&lt;ref name=LR33/&gt;

She carried coal from ports in [[North East England]] down the North Sea coast and up the Thames&lt;ref name=COI-53/&gt; to the gas works at Wandsworth in south-west London. She had capacity for a cargo of up to 2,200 [[long ton]]s of coal.

==War service==
In the Second World War ''Wandle'' travelled laden in [[List of convoy codes#F|FS-series convoys]] southwards as far as [[Southend]] and in ballast in [[List of convoy codes#F|FN-series]] or [[List of convoy codes#E|EC-series convoys]]  from [[Southend]] northwards. When the UK [[Defensively equipped merchant ship|armed its merchant ships]] she was fitted with one [[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12 pounder gun]], two [[Lewis gun]]s and a [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]] gun.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt;

===Sea and air attacks===
During air attacks on 13 and 31 August 1940, ''Wandle'' succeeded in hitting enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt; On the latter occasion a fire started on her [[Degaussing#Degaussing ships' hulls|degaussing]] cable but her engineers repaired the cable enabling her to pass through a heavily [[Naval mine|mined]] area.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt;

On 23 March 1941 in the North Sea an [[E-boat]] attacked her with rapid gunfire but ''Wandle''{{'}}s [[Chief mate|Mate]], Edward Clarke, returned fire with the 12-pounder and with his sixth shot disabled the E-boat's gun and repulsed the attack.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt;

At 2340 hrs on 11 June 1941 enemy aircraft torpedoed and sank the {{GRT|2056|link=off}} coaster SS ''Moorwood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?11710 |title=SS Moorwood [+1941] |last1=Allen |first1=Tony |last2=Racey |first2=Carl |date=26 February 2011 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wandle''{{'}}s Mate recovered a man who had been blown overboard from ''Moorwood'' into the sea; then the Mate and ''Wandle''{{'}}s crew picked up the remainder from ''Moorwood''{{'}}s lifeboat.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt;

During an air attack on 20 September 1941, ''Wandle'' fired at enemy aircraft and succeeded in damaging one.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt; On 24 October during an attack off the east coast of [[Norfolk]] she returned fire and &quot;probably&quot; hit an enemy E-boat.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt;

In April 1942 Captain Mastin was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] and Edward Clarke was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for the fine defence of their ship.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt;

===Torpedoing and salvage===
At 2125 hrs on 9 November 1942 ''Wandle'' was in ballast heading northwards off [[Lowestoft]] when a flotilla of E-boats attacked her convoy.&lt;ref name=Burntisland/&gt; A torpedo struck her starboard side about {{convert|20|ft|0}} forward of her bridge.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt; It almost completely blew off her bow, and flung débris so far that it killed a [[Royal Artillery]] Maritime Regiment [[Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships|DEMS]] gunner in the after part of the ship.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt; After 20 minutes her crew launched both lifeboats and abandoned ship.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt; A rescue tug recovered the survivors and then went to recover survivors from another ship that had been sunk.&lt;ref name=COI-54/&gt; After this ''Wandle'' was still afloat but she was on fire, her below decks accommodation was flooded, her fore part awash and her no. 2 [[Hold (ship)|hold]] taking water.&lt;ref name=COI-55&gt;Central Office of Information, 1947, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Mastin assembled a volunteer crew of nine men including himself and the Mate Edward Clarke.&lt;ref name=COI-55/&gt; They reboarded the ship and extinguished the fire, and a party directed by the Chief Engineer J.S. Johnson got her dynamo and pumps started.&lt;ref name=COI-55/&gt; The rescue tug took her in tow, but her ruined bow was still attached which worked as a large and unwieldy [[sea anchor]].&lt;ref name=COI-56&gt;Central Office of Information, 1947, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; This limited their progress to about {{convert|1|kn|km/h|0}}, and it took the tug 16 hours to tow ''Wandle'' to [[Great Yarmouth]] the next day.&lt;ref name=COI-56/&gt; She was anchored off Yarmouth and her condition was deemed so precarious that she was abandoned a second time.&lt;ref name=COI-56/&gt;

An [[Admiralty]] salvage officer came aboard and cut away several hundred tons of wreckage.&lt;ref name=COI-56/&gt; This relieved the strain on her [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]], which was then patched and shored up with heavy timbers.&lt;ref name=COI-56/&gt; She was towed into Yarmouth for a few hours but was then towed north again by two tugs.&lt;ref name=COI-56/&gt; A northerly gale arose and swung her about violently, and she was often awash.&lt;ref name=COI-56/&gt; The tugs and ''Wandle'' sheltered in the Humber to escape heavy seas and in a bay to wait for fog to pass.&lt;ref name=COI-56/&gt; On the fifth day after being torpedoed, ''Wandle'' finally reached the [[River Tyne]].&lt;ref name=COI-56/&gt; On 5 December she was [[dry-dock]]ed at [[John Readhead &amp; Sons]]' shipyard&lt;ref name=JR&gt;John Redhead &amp; Sons, 1948 (pages not numbered)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[South Shields]].&lt;ref name=Burntisland/&gt; During this whole period of salvage and towing, the volunteer crew led by Captain George Mastin, Mate Edward Clarke and Engineer &quot;Stanley&quot; Johnson, remained with the Wandle, until she was safely docked at Redheads, to ensure no salvage claims were made on the owners.&lt;ref&gt;Private papers and photographs of Captain Mastin&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wandle'' had not only lost her bow; what remained of her was now badly twisted.&lt;ref name=COI-56/&gt; Readheads straightened her, built a new bow onto her&lt;ref name=COI-56/&gt; and on either 30 March&lt;ref name=JR/&gt; or 8 April 1943&lt;ref name=Burntisland/&gt; she was ready to return to service.

==Final years==
In 1949 the Wandsworth and District Gas Company was nationalised and became part of the new [[South Eastern Gas Board]]. ''Wandle'' became part of the SEGB fleet and remained in service until 1959.&lt;ref name=Burntisland/&gt; A Dutch tug then towed her across the North Sea to [[Rotterdam]], where she arrived on 3 November 1959 to be scrapped.&lt;ref name=Burntisland/&gt;

The three photos in dry dock show her before and after her damaged bow was cut away, and after her hull had been straightened and rebuilt.
