'''Albrecht Brandi''' (20 June 1914 – 6 January 1966) was a German [[U-boat]] [[commander]] in [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]]. Together with [[Wolfgang Lüth]], he was the only ''Kriegsmarine'' sailor who was awarded with the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]], a decoration awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or outstanding military leadership. Brandi is credited with the sinking of eight merchant ships for a total of {{GRT|25,879|disp=long}}, one auxiliary warship of {{GRT|810|link=off}}, and three warships of {{convert|5000|LT|abbr=off|lk=on}}.

Brandi, the son of the industrial-manager [[Ernst Brandi]], was born in [[Dortmund]], Germany and grew up in the [[Weimar Republic]]. After the rise of the [[Third Reich]] in 1933, he joined the navy in 1935. Following service on [[M-class minesweeper (Germany)|minesweepers]], Brandi began his U-boat career in April 1941. He first served as a commander-in-training on {{GS|U-552||2}}, which was commanded by [[Erich Topp]], before taking command of {{GS|U-617||2}} in April 1942 on seven war patrols, all but one in the [[Mediterranean U-boat Campaign (World War II)|Mediterranean theater of operations]]. On 12 September 1943, ''U-617'' came under aerial attack off the Moroccan coast. ''U-617'' was severely damaged forcing Brandi to beach the boat. The crew abandoned ship and were interned by Spanish forces. Brandi escaped internment and returned to Germany where he was given command of {{GS|U-380||2}} which he took on one patrol before the submarine was destroyed in an aerial attack while at port in [[Toulon]]. He was then given command of {{GS|U-967||2}}. After one patrol, Brandi was appointed chief of U-boat operations in the eastern [[Baltic Sea]]. In January 1945, Brandi was placed in charge of the ''[[K-Verband|Marinekleinkampfverbände]]'' (small naval battle units) in the Netherlands where he surrendered to Canadian forces at the end of the war.

Following his release from captivity in September 1945, Brandi became a [[bricklayer]] and then studied [[architecture]]. For three years he served as chairman of the [[Association of German Architects]]. Brandi fell ill and died suddenly on 6 January 1966 at a hospital in [[Cologne]] and was buried with [[Military funeral|military honors]] in Dortmund.

==Early life and career==
Brandi  was born on 20 June 1914 in [[Dortmund]] at the time in the [[Province of Westphalia]], in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. He was the sixth and youngest child of [[Ernst Brandi]], a [[mining]] director and board member of the ''[[Vereinigte Stahlwerke]]'' (United Steelworks), and his wife Clara, née Jucho.{{sfn|Pudor, Fritz|1955}} Following graduation from secondary school, he joined the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (later renamed to ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'') in 1935.

He received his military basic training and was transferred to the [[school ship]] [[Gorch Fock (1933)|''Gorch Fock'']] attaining the rank of ''[[Midshipman|Seekadett]]'' (midshipman). He was posted to the light cruiser {{Ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}} (26 September 1935&amp;nbsp;– 19 June 1936).{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=308}} Brandi sailed on ''Karlsruhe''{{'}}s fifth training cruise, which started in October 1935 in [[Kiel]] and ended in June 1936. The journey took him and her crew to [[Tenerife]], the [[Seychelles]], the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan, [[San Diego]], through the [[Panama Canal]] and back to Kiel.{{sfn|Hildebrand|Röhr|Steinmetz|1993|p=89}}

Following his journey on ''Karlsruhe'', Brandi attended the main cadet course at the [[Naval Academy Mürwik]] (20 June 1936&amp;nbsp;– 31 March 1937).&lt;ref group=Tr&gt;main cadet course—''Hauptlehrgang für Fähnriche''&lt;/ref&gt; During this time frame at the naval academy he advanced in rank to ''[[Fähnrich zur See]]'' (officer cadet) on 1 July 1936. Starting on 1 April, he underwent a number of specialized weapons training courses for cadets at [[Mürwik]].&lt;ref group=Tr&gt;weapons course for cadets—''Waffenlehrgang für Fähnriche''&lt;/ref&gt; Brandi was then transferred to the [[M-class minesweeper (Germany)|minesweeper]] ''M-125'', serving as third [[watch officer]]. On 2 October 1937, he then transferred to the minesweeper {{ship|German minesweeper|M-1||2}}, under the command of ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' (Captain Lieutenant) [[Hans Bartels]], in the 1. ''Minensuchflottille'' (1st Minesweeper Flotilla), again holding the position of a watch officer. On this assignment he was promoted to ''[[Oberfähnrich zur See]]'' (Senior Ensign) on 1 January 1938 and to ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' (Second Lieutenant) on 1 April 1938.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=308}}

==World War II==
At the outbreak of World War II, Brandi continued to serve on minesweeper ''M-1''. ''M-1'' transported the ''[[Marinestosstruppkompanie]]'', a reinforced naval infantry platoon, to {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}} prior to the [[Battle of Westerplatte|attack of the Polish base]] at [[Danzig]]'s [[Westerplatte]] in the early morning hours of 1 September 1939.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=86}} On 1 October 1939, he was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' (First Lieutenant).{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=308}} Following the [[Invasion of Poland]], ''M-1'' undertook various [[Naval mine|minefield]] clearing operations in the [[North Sea|North]] and Baltic Sea. On 24 February 1940, without prior warning, ''M-1'' [[Naval ram|rammed]] and sank four [[Esbjerg]] based Danish trawlers, ''Ejjam'' (E&amp;nbsp;92), ''Gerlis'' (E&amp;nbsp;456), ''Mercator'' (E&amp;nbsp;348) and ''Polaris'' (E&amp;nbsp;504) in the vicinity of the [[Dogger Bank]]. Bartels reported to his superiors that no one was rescued due to &quot;military reasons&quot;; 16 fishermen from the then neutral Denmark lost their lives.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|2007}} In April 1940 on ''M-1'', Brandi participated in [[Operation Weserübung|Operation ''Weserübung'']], Germany's assault on Denmark and Norway, and was awarded both classes of the [[Iron Cross]] ({{lang|de|''Eisernes Kreuz''}}).{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=86}}

On 25 May 1940, Brandi was appointed commander of ''M-1''.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=308}} In this command position, Brandi came into contact with the [[U-boat]] force, providing escort duty to U-boats leaving and returning to port. He applied for service with U-boat arm but was rejected at first.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=86}} In April 1941, Brandi applied again, was accepted and started his U-boat training at the Naval Academy Mürwik which he completed on 24 December 1941 at [[Neustadt in Holstein]]. On 25 December 1941, Brandi became a ''Kommandantenschüler'' (Commander-in-training) aboard {{GS|U-552||2}}, which was commanded by ''Kapitänleutnant'' [[Erich Topp]], for one war patrol (25 December 1941 – 27 January 1942). On this patrol before the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], ''U-552'' sank three ships, the British ''Dayrose'' on 15 January, the US ''Frances Salman'' and the Greek ''Maro'' on 18 January. On 28 January 1942, Brandi was stationed at the [[Blohm &amp; Voss]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]], for familiarization with {{GS|U-617||2}}, a [[German Type VIIC submarine|Type VIIC]] U-boat. On 9 April 1942, Brandi commissioned ''U-617'' in Kiel and completed various trainings with this boat in the [[5th U-boat Flotilla]].{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=86}}

===First patrol, Wolfpack ''Pfeil''===
For his first patrol (29 August&amp;nbsp;– 7 October 1942), Brandi left Kiel in August 1942, operating in the [[Western Approaches]] before arriving at [[St. Nazaire]], France in October. There ''U-617'' was subordinated to the [[7th U-boat Flotilla]].{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=308}} On this patrol, Brandi claimed four merchant ships sunk.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=309}} On 7 September, Brandi sank his first ship, the Faroes trawler ''Tor II''.{{sfn|Bertke|Smith|Kindell|2009|p=37}} ''U-617'' was then part of [[Wolfpack Pfeil|Wolfpack ''Pfeil'']], which also included {{GS|U-216||2}}, {{GS|U-221||2}}, {{GS|U-258||2}}, {{GS|U-356||2}}, {{GS|U-595||2}}, {{GS|U-607||2}} and {{GS|U-615||2}}, and operated against [[Convoy SC 100]]. On the night 22/23 September, Brandi sank one ship, the tanker ''Athelsultan'',{{sfn|White|2008|pp=166–168}} and in the following day two stragglers for {{GRT|14,787|disp=long}}.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1968|pp=281–282}} One of the stragglers sunk by Brandi on 23 September was the formerly Danish steamer ''Tennessee''.{{sfn|Bertke|Smith|Kindell|2009|p=47}} The other straggler, the Belgian steamer ''Roumanie'', was sunk at 13:58 on 24 September, killing the master, 35 crewmen and 6 gunners; only the chief engineer survived.{{sfn|Bertke|Smith|Kindell|2009|p=54}} Brandi rescued the chief engineer in violation of the [[Laconia Order]] issued by ''[[Großadmiral]]'' (German Grand Admiral) [[Karl Dönitz]].{{sfn|Mulligan|2013|loc=chptr. &quot;The Laconia Incident&quot;}} On 26 September, Brandi sighted Convoy ON 131, his attack failed due to torpedo malfunctions.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1968|p=286}} On this patrol, Brandi was promoted to ''Kapitänleutnant'' on 1 October 1942. After this patrol, on 8 October 1942, he received the [[U-boat War Badge]] ({{Lang|de|''U-Boot-Kriegsabzeichen''}}).{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=86}}

===Second patrol, war in the Mediterranean Sea===
On his second patrol (2–28 November 1942), Brandi was ordered to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] where he was placed under the command of the [[29th U-boat Flotilla]].{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=308}} His mission in the [[Mediterranean U-boat Campaign (World War II)|Mediterranean theater of operations]] was to help secure the supply routes for the ''[[Afrikakorps]]'' in North Africa. To get to his destination Brandi had to traverse the heavily guarded [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. Brandi made the passage on 8 November 1942 submerged. Nevertheless, ''U-617'' was discovered by a British [[Short Sunderland]] bomber which dropped two [[depth charge]]s, but missed. That day, [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] forces invaded [[French North Africa]] in [[Operation Torch]] (8–16 November 1942). At 11:27 on 21 November, Brandi attacked a strong British naval task force, firing a spread of four torpedoes at distance. Following the assault, ''U-617'' came under attack. Over four hours, 80 depth charges were dropped on ''U-617''. At 16:00 on 23 November, Brandi unsuccessfully attacked a [[cruiser]] before arriving in [[La Spezia]] on 28 November 1942.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=86}} Although no ships were actually sunk that day, the ''[[Führer der Unterseeboote]]'' Italy (FdU—Leader of U-boat Operations) later credited Brandi with the sinking of one cruiser of French or American origin, and one [[destroyer]]. Additionally the FdU acknowledged that Brandi had torpedoed two freighters, their sinking was assumed. The FdU denied him credit for having severely damaged a battleship.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=310}}

===Third patrol, Knight's Cross===
On his third patrol (21 December 1942 – 17 January 1943) before the coast of [[Cyrenaica]], in December 1942, Brandi sank the ocean tug {{HMS|St. Issey|W25}},{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1968|p=309}} and two merchant ships, ''Annitsa'' and ''Harboe Jensen'' on 15 January 1943. Following this patrol which ended in [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], the FdU credited Brandi with the destruction of one destroyer, one tug of {{GRT|1000|link=off}} and one [[Lighter (barge)|lighter]] of unknown tonnage, all three sunk on 28 December 1942. The FdU further acknowledged the sinking of three ships on 30 December of {{GRT|22000|link=off}}, two ships on 13 January 1943 of {{GRT|5000|link=off}}, and two more ships on 15 January of {{GRT|13000|link=off}}. The ''[[Befehlshaber der U-Boote]]'' (BdU—U-boats Commander-in-Chief) confirmed this assessment and credited Brandi with the sinking of eight ships totalling {{GRT|41000|link=off}} and one destroyer.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=310}} For this achievement, Brandi was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes''}}) on 21 January 1943. The presentation was made by the commanding Admiral [[Aegean Sea]], ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (Vice Admiral) [[Erich Förste]], in La Spezia.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=87}}

===Fourth patrol===
During his fourth patrol (27 January – 13 February 1943) which started at the [[Salamis Naval Base]] and ended in [[Pula]], Brandi sank the British [[minelayer]] {{HMS|Welshman|M84|6}} a few miles from the [[Malta|Maltese]] coast on 1 February 1943. Welshman, together with the minelayer {{HMS|Abdiel|M39|6}} and the mine-laying submarine {{HMS|Rorqual |N74|6}}, had been operating against the [[Axis powers|Axis]] supply route between the [[Gulf of Tunis]] and [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1968|p=320}} In addition, Brandi also claimed to have sunk four ships from two convoys for a total of {{GRT|10800|link=off}}.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1968|p=321}} Verifiable were the destruction of the Norwegian freighter ''Corona'' and ''Henrik'', both sunk on 5 February 1943 from Convoy AW 22.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=87}}

===Fifth patrol, Oak Leaves===
In April 1943, on his fifth patrol (25 March – 17 April 1943), Brandi claimed the sinking of a [[light cruiser]], {{convert|40|nmi}} off [[Gibraltar]]. The FdU credited him with the sinking of a [[Crown Colony-class cruiser|''Fiji''-class cruiser]], a [[Tribal-class destroyer (1936)|''Tribal''-class destroyer]] on 10 April and a troop transport type ''Orcades'' of {{GRT|23456|link=off}} attacked on 13 April.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=311}} On this patrol, Brandi was awarded [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub''}}) on 11 April 1943, the 224th officer or soldier of the Wehrmacht so honored. Although Brandi was not mentioned by name, his claim to have sunk a cruiser was mentioned in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]'', a [[propaganda]] radio report, on 12 April 1943.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=87}}

===Sixth patrol===
In June 1943, on his sixth patrol (31 May – 20 July 1943), a roundtrip from Toulon, with the objective to engage enemy shipping east of Gibralta before the Algerian coast. On this patrol, the FdU credited Brandi with the unverifiable destruction of an [[G and H-class destroyer|H-class destroyer]].{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=311}}

===Seventh patrol, loss of ''U-617''===
[[File:U-617 kentert.jpg|thumb|right|''U-617'' aground near [[Mellila, Morocco]] after British air attack 12 September 1943.]]
In September 1943, in his last patrol in ''U-617'', Brandi sank {{HMS|Puckeridge|L108|6}}, a [[Hunt class destroyer]], off Gibraltar.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1968|p=377}} A few days later, on the night of 10 September, she was attacked near the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] coast by [[Royal Air Force]] [[Wellington]] aircraft from [[No. 179 Squadron RAF|No. 179 Squadron]] piloted by [[Squadron Leader]] D. B. Hodgkinson in position {{coord|35|38|N|03|27|W|type:event|name=U-617 (u-boat)}} damaging ''U-617''. Three hours later, on 11 September, another No. 179 Squadron aircraft piloted by [[Pilot Officer]] W. H. Brunini dropped more [[depth charge]]s. The resultant damage to ''U-617'' was so severe that Brandi could no longer risk to dive. To avoid capture, Brandi decided to sail ''U-617'' to shallow waters and abanded ship off [[Melilla]], Spanish Morocco in position {{coord|35|13|N|03|21|W|type:event|name=U-617 (u-boat)}}.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=309}} After evacuating into rubber boats, the crew managed to reach the shore without loss and were interned by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops. Brandi was loosely confined in the officers' camp near [[Cadiz]]. With the help of the German [[naval attaché]] in [[Madrid]], he received a fake passport with the cover name &quot;Albert Bergmann&quot;  and from there returned to Germany. The wrecked ''U-617'', aground offshore, was finally destroyed and sunk by air attack from [[Lockheed Hudson]] bombers from [[No. 48 Squadron RAF|No. 48]] and [[No. 233 Squadron RAF|No. 233 Squadron]] and naval gunfire from {{HMS|Hyacinth|K84|6}} and {{HMAS|Wollongong|J172|6}}.{{sfn|Blair|2000|p=414}}{{sfn|Nesbit|2008|p=166}}

===Patrols on ''U-380'' and ''U-967'', Swords===
On 19 November 1943, Brandi returned to Toulon and took command of {{GS|U-380||2}} from ''Kapitänleutnant'' Josef Röther. ''U-380'' was damaged in an aerial attack on 24 November. Three waves of over 100 [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers had targeted the U-boat base at the [[military port of Toulon]].{{sfn|Röll|Besler|2014|p=248}} The [[pressure hull]] was punctured in three places, requiring extended repairs. On 11 December, Brandi began with first test runs before torpedoes and provisions were stored on 18/19 December.{{sfn|Röll|Besler|2014|p=249}} Brandi completed one patrol (20 December 1943 – 21 January 1944) with ''U-380'', it was ''U-380''{{'}}s tenth and last patrol before the boat was destroyed on 11 March 1944 in Toulon by a bombing raid of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[Ninth Air Force]]. On 24 December, Brandi attacked what he identified as a H-class destroyer. Röll and Besler state that this destroyer may have been the French destroyer [[French destroyer Fantasque|''Fantasque'']].{{sfn|Röll|Besler|2014|p=250}}

On his return to Toulon on 21 January, Brandi, due to a navigational error of {{convert|45|nmi}}, ran ''U-380'' aground. Two [[tugboat]]s called in from Toulon had to pull ''U-380'' free again. ''[[Kapitän zur See]]'' (Captain at See) [[Werner Hartmann]], the new FdU Mediterranean Sea, evaluated Brandi's performance and severely criticized him for his bad performance on this patrol. In particular his report stated that Brandi failed to maintain a proper war diary, which makes it difficult to assess Brand's decisions. He went on that Brand's attacks were carried out to passively, avoiding contact with the enemy, apparently diving away too early. Hartmann concluded that ''U-380''{{'}}s running aground was caused by &quot;sloppy&quot; navigation.{{sfn|Röll|Besler|2014|pp=258–261}} Nevertheless, both the FdU and BdU credited Brandi with torpedoing one destroyer on 23 December and probably having sunk another destroyer on 11 January.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=313}}

On 22 January 1944, ''U-380'' was taken to the shipyard at Missiessy for a major overhaul of the boat. An attack carried out by the 15th USAAF on 4 February damaged ''U-380'', extending its planned maintenance time. ''U-380'' was ready again for sea trials on 8 March. On 11 March, fully equipped and ready again for its next war patrol, it was moored just outside of Missiessy. At 12:00, Toulon came under attack of 120 [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s of the [[47th Air Division|47th Bombardment Wing]] of the Ninth Air Force. ''U-380'' took a direct hit, killing the ''Dieselmaat'' Jonny Christof and two shipyard employees.{{sfn|Röll|Besler|2014|p=263}}

In April 1944 Brandi became commander of {{GS|U-967||2}}. During his first and only patrol (11 April – 17 May 1944) with her in May 1944 Brandi, operating against convoy GUS 38, sank the destroyer {{USS|Fechteler|DE-157|6}} on the night of 4/5 May 1944 with a [[G7es torpedo|T-5]] [[acoustic torpedo]]. Two further attacks with acoustic torpedoes on 26 April and 8 May were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1968|p=445}} Following this he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern''}}) on 9 May 1944.{{sfn|Stem|2012|p=249}} Brandi was the 66th member of the Wehrmacht and last sailor of the ''Kriegsmarine'' who received this award.

===Ashore===

Brandi had to surrender command of ''U-967'' because he had fallen seriously ill with [[tonsillitis]] on his last patrol. On 8 June 1944, he was promoted to ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' (Corvette Captain), backdated to 9 May 1944. In July 1944, Brandi was then appointed U-''Admiralstabsoffizier'' (Asto—officer of the admiralty staff) commander of all U-boat operations in the [[Gulf of Finland]] with commanding admiral of the eastern [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Helsinki]],&lt;ref group=&quot;Tr&quot;&gt;commanding admiral of the eastern Baltic Sea—''Kommandierender Admiral östliche Ostsee''&lt;/ref&gt; under the command of Admiral [[Theodor Burchardi]].{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=309}} Following the loss of the German naval bases in Finland, the German U-boats operated from [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], present-day Gdańsk, and [[Gdynia|Gotenhafen]], present-day Gdynia. Their primary area of operations was the passage into the Gulf of Finland. In September–October 1944, Brandi had ordered {{GS|U-717||2}}, {{GS|U-958||2}}, {{GS|U-370||2}}, {{GS|U-348||2}}, {{GS|U-475||2}}, {{GS|U-745||2}}, {{GS|U-290||2}}, {{GS|U-1165||2}} and {{GS|U-481||2}} into this area of operations. On 21 September {{GS|U-242||2}} and {{GS|U-1001||2}} laid a mine barrage before the peninsula [[Porkkala]] which subsequently sank the Finnish cargo ship [[List of shipwrecks in October 1944#28 October|''Rigel'']]. On 8/9 October, ''U-370'' sank one [[Motor Gun Boat]] and the Finnish trawler ''No. 764'', ''U-481'' sank a Finnish sailboat on 15 October, ''U-1165'' sank one minesweeper and attacked a submarine convoy, ''U-958'' sank two Finnish sailboats, ''U-1001'' torpedoed one trawler on 25 October, and ''U-475'' sank one patrol boat. In November–December 1944, Brandi dispatched ''U-475'', ''U-958'', ''U-479'', ''U-481'', ''U-679'' and ''U-1165'' into the ''Bottenbusen'', the northern part of the Gulf of Finland, and to the area between [[Hanko]] and [[Rewal]]. ''U-679'' sank one escort ship and one mine layer and was sunk by the Soviet anti-submarine vessel ''MO-124'' on 9 January 1945. ''U-481'' sank one lighter and probably the {{ship|Finnish minelayer|Louhi}} on 12 January.{{refn|Archival research in Germany in the new millennium revealed that the likely cause was a sound-seeking torpedo fired by ''U-370''.{{sfn|Huhtanen|2015|p=A 10}}|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} ''U-637'' sank one patrol boat.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1968|p=480}}

Brandi was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten''}}) on 24 November 1944 for his leadership of the U-boat fleet. On 18 December 1944, he was promoted to ''[[Fregattenkapitän]]'' (Frigate Captain). In the last year of the war, Brandi became chief commander of the ''[[K-Verband|Marinekleinkampfverbände]]'' (small naval battle units) in [[IJmuiden]] in the Netherlands. On 6 May 1945, Brandi surrendered to Canadian forces in the Netherlands and was taken [[prisoner of war]].

==Later life==
In September 1945, Brandi was released from captivity. He became a [[bricklayer]] and then studied [[architecture]] at the ''Staatsbauschule'' (State Construction School) in [[Essen]]. He designed a number of buildings which were built in Dortmund and in Saudi Arabia. For three years he served as chairman of the [[Association of German Architects]] ({{Lang|de|''Bund Deutscher Architekten''}}). He and his wife Eva had six children. Their daughter [[:de:Sabine Brandi|Sabine Brandi (de)]], born in 1953, is a journalist with the ''[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' (West German Broadcasting). Brandi fell ill and died on 6 January 1966 at a hospital in [[Cologne]]. He was buried with [[Military funeral|military honors]] at the [[:de:Hauptfriedhof Dortmund|''Hauptfriedhof'' Dortmund]]. His former &quot;Crew 35&quot; comrade, [[Reinhard Suhren]], delivered the [[eulogy]]. The ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' (German Navy) was represented by ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (Rear Admiral) [[Günter Kuhnke]].{{sfn|Röll|Besler|2014|p=295}}
