The '''Battle of Matamoros'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasnavy.com/quiz1.htm|title=Official Website of the Texas Navies|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001031728/http://www.texasnavy.com/quiz1.htm|archivedate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a naval engagement during the [[Texas Revolution]] on April 3, 1836, between the brig ''Montezuma'' of the [[Mexican Navy]] and the schooner ''Invincible'' of the [[Texas Navy]]. The Mexican ship was outmaneuvered and repeatedly hit before running aground and being abandoned.  The Port of Matamoros, also known as Los Brazos de Santiago, was the Mexican army's primary resupply base for the operations of General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]], who was finally defeated on April 21, 1836, outside [[Houston]] at the [[battle of San Jacinto]].

==Background==
The [[Texan schooner Invincible|''Invincible'']] was purchased by the [[Republic of Texas|Texan]] government, then [[Texas Revolution|in rebellion]], because the Texans were disturbed by the appearance of Mexican naval raiders along the [[Gulf Coast]]. Captain [[Jeremiah Brown (Captain)|Jeremiah Brown]] was given command of the ''Invincible'' on March 12, 1836, in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]].

Captain Brown was tasked with defending the Texas coast, and neutralizing the Mexican [[man-of-war]] ''Montezuma''. The ''Invincible'' cruised south to the mouth of the [[Rio Grande]], where on April 3, 1836, she encountered the ten-gun Mexican [[brig]] in the Port of Matamoros (also known as Brazos Santiago, now Boca Chica) at the mouth of the [[Laguna Madre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hbktx1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Invincible |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qti02 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125054843/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qti02 |archivedate=November 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
The Texan ship was outgunned and outmanned. The ''Montezuma'' had two 68-pounder guns, eight 32-pounder [[Paixhans gun]]s, and had a crew of about 75 men. The Paixhans guns fired a shell that exploded on impact, creating a shower of shrapnel over the target. The ''Invincible'' had two 18-pounder guns, two 9-pounder guns, and four 6-pounder guns and carried a smaller crew than ''Montezuma''.

At 10:00 am the ''Invincible'' approached the ''Montezuma'' and raised the Texas colors, and Captain Jeremiah Brown ordered his artillerists to open fire on the ''Montezuma''. For a short while the two warships exchanged broadsides, scoring some hits. ''Invincible'' outmaneuvered ''Montezuma'' by sailing in circles around the Mexican vessel, firing broadsides the entire time. ''Invincible'' made only two passes before the slower Mexican cruiser was in flames. Eventually the ''Montezuma'' ran aground on a [[sandbar]], sealing her fate. The Mexican officers and crew quickly escaped into the water from the severely damaged vessel and made it ashore on the enemy coast. The ''Invincible'' continued to barrage her opponent until she was destroyed. Casualties are unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;hbktx1&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Texans emerged victorious, having destroyed the ''Montezuma''. Later that day, the ''Invincible'' encountered an [[United States|American]] merchant vessel, the ''Pocket''. After engaging and capturing the ''Pocket'', Captain Brown discovered a cache of weapons, as well as supplies being shipped to the [[Mexican Army]]. Accompanying the supplies were Mexican naval officers and a considerable amount of military documents, all in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The ''Pocket'' was sent to Galveston under a [[prize crew]]. The supplies aboard the ''Pocket'' were sent to General [[Sam Houston]]'s army, where the general used them against the Mexicans at [[Battle of San Jacinto|San Jacinto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hbktx1&quot;/&gt;

This action by the Texas Navy of disrupting the Mexican army's maritime based supply chain, operating through the Port of Matamoros, was a significant factor in the Mexicans' later defeat at San Jacinto, Texas.  Their vastly superior army was forced to scatter into several smaller units in order to procure food throughout Texas, thus diluting their numerical advantage.
