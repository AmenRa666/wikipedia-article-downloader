'''Bert Stiles''' (August 30, 1920 - November 26, 1944) was an American [[author]] of [[short story|short stories]] who was [[killed in action]] during [[World War II]] while serving as a [[fighter pilot]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Forces]].

==Youth==
Born in [[Denver, Colorado]] he was the son of an [[electrician]], Bert Stiles Senior, and a music teacher, Elizabeth Huddleston Stiles. He attended Denver's South High School and worked summers as a junior [[forest ranger]] in [[Estes Park]], both of which became sources of material for his short stories.

After graduation from high school in 1938 he entered [[Colorado College]], with a pronounced interest in writing both stories and [[poetry]]. He became a feature writer for the campus [[newspaper]], ''The Tiger'', expressing pacifist views{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} in vogue at the time, and in June 1941, isolated himself in his [[Fraternity and sorority houses|fraternity]] house and produced twenty-seven short stories.

Stiles mailed samples of his prose to Ruth and Max Aley, literary agents in [[New York City]], who expressed an interest in seeing more. Stiles left college to [[hitchhike]] to New York; he was stopped twice by [[police]] and sent home twice, but eventually reached New York and delivered his stories in person. The Aleys employed him as a [[handyman]] and provided him living space on their farm in [[Connecticut]] in order to mentor him in his writing. Stiles wrote ten hours a day throughout the summer of 1941 and his diligence was rewarded when his first story was accepted in September by the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', which eventually published &quot;The Ranger&quot; series of stories based on his experiences in Estes Park. He also sold stories to ''[[Liberty (magazine)|Liberty]]'' and ''[[The American (magazine)|The American]]'' magazines.

==USAAF service==
Stiles enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in January 1943, becoming an aviation cadet, and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[U.S. Army Air Corps|Air Corps]], in November. He won pilots wings and was assigned to a [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] replacement crew sent to the [[Eighth Air Force]] in March 1944.

===Bomber co-pilot===
[[File:Boeing B-17G Superfortress Shoo Shoo Baby USAF.jpg|thumb|300px|Boeing B-17G &quot;Shoo Shoo Baby&quot; at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.]]

Assigned to the [[701st Tactical Air Support Squadron|401st Bomb Squadron]], [[91st Bomb Group]] at [[RAF Bassingbourn|Bassingbourn]], [[England]], he began flying missions with the crew of 2nd Lt. Sam Newton on April 19, 1944, with their first to [[Kassel]], [[Germany]]. Thereafter the crew flew an average of two to three missions per week, usually on consecutive days. This pattern continued through May as the 91st attacked both strategic targets in Germany, [[V-1 Flying Bomb|V-1]] launch sites, and targets in [[France]] in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]]. Their first mission against [[Berlin]] occurred on May 7.

Newton's crew was assigned to and primarily flew a B-17G-50-BO, s/n 42-102504, nicknamed ''Times A-Wastin'''; it carried the [[fuselage]] codes LL - D. The crew flew one mission in another noted 91st B-17, ''[[Shoo Shoo Baby (B-17)|Shoo Shoo Baby]]'', on May 25, 1944, to bomb [[Nancy, France|Essey-les-Nancy]] airfield in [[France]], but turned back to base early because the plane's [[oxygen]] system malfunctioned.

Stiles continued to write, both highly personalized pieces for the [[London]] ''[[Daily Mail]]'', articles for ''[[Yank (newspaper)|Yank]]'' and ''[[Air Force Association|Air Force Magazine]]'', and the manuscript for a book. He eventually flew twenty missions with Sam Newton's crew, and his manuscript was a [[diary|journal]]-style [[memoir]] of his experiences with them. In mid-June 1944, he was separated from Newton's crew and out of combat for a month, and when he resumed flying, he finished his 35-mission combat tour for the 91st Bomb Group with a different crew.

===Fighter pilot===
Stiles refused an opportunity to return to the United States as a flight instructor and volunteered for a second tour with the Eighth, requesting an assignment to [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]s. He completed conversion training and was assigned as a pilot with the [[505th Fighter Squadron]], [[339th Fighter Group]], a [[P-51 Mustang]] unit stationed at [[Fowlmere]], England, about five miles distant from his previous base at Bassingbourn.

On November 26, 1944, on the 16th mission of his second tour, Stiles' squadron was flying at 26,000 feet altitude south of [[Hanover]], Germany, on a bomber escort mission. Stiles was flying a P-51 nicknamed ''Tar Heel'', normally flown by Captain James R. Starnes of his squadron (P-51D- s/n 44-14113). Encountering 40-60 [[Luftwaffe]] [[FW-190]]s, Stiles engaged one in combat and shot it down (Air Force Historical Study No. 85 credits Stiles with the kill), but apparently became disoriented when the dogfight descended to low altitude. His P-51 impacted the ground almost immediately, killing him. Stiles is interred at the [[Ardennes American Cemetery and Memorial|Ardennes American Cemetery]], [[Neupré]], [[Liège (province)|Liège]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Stiles&amp;GSfn=Bert&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdy=1944&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=14451850&amp;df=all&amp; Find a grave memorial Bert Stiles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Serenade to the Big Bird''==
His mother commemorated his memory by having his book published in 1947 in England (Lindsay Drummond Ltd.), with its first U.S. publication in 1952 ([[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]]). Entitled '''''Serenade to the Big Bird''''', the book achieved cult status among aviation enthusiasts for its honest depictions of bomber combat and also won favorable literary reviews for its spare, [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]-style prose and its anti-war sensitivity[citation needed]. It has been re-issued periodically, the most recent in 1998.
