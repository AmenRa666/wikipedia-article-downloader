{{Russo-Georgian war}}
The [[Russo-Georgian War]] broke out in August 2008 and involved [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russian Federation]], [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]].

== Background ==
Events prior to August 2008 are described in [[2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis]].

Tensions began escalating in 2008 since [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Kosovo declared its independence]], but the definitive trigger was a bombing on the road near [[Tskhinvali]] on 1 August, which injured five Georgian policemen. This provocation allegedly was prepared in advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunday_Times_17_Aug_09&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4545980.ece | title=The new cold war hots up | publisher=The Times | date=17 August 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817022835/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4545980.ece |archivedate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A chain of reactions and counter-reactions followed.

== Overview timeline ==

== Detailed timeline ==

=== August 1 – August 6 ===
A Georgian police car was blown up at 08:05 on the Eredvi-Kheiti road. Joint Peacekeeping Forces (JPKF) commander's media assistant Captain Vladimir Ivanov reported that JPKF military observers from all three sides and OSCE representatives investigated a bomb attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cominf.org/2008/08/01/1166477777.html |script-title=ru:Сообщение Ош ССПМ |date=1 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814022046/http://cominf.org/2008/08/01/1166477777.html |archivedate=14 August 2008|language=ru}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion, which had been probably engineered by South Ossetian separatists, injured five Georgian policemen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunday_Times_17_Aug_09&quot;/&gt; 122&amp;nbsp;mm artillery shells had been used to make the bombs, according to Russian peacekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2373294 |title=OSSETIAN SEPARATISTS ARE PROVOKING A MAJOR RUSSIAN INTERVENTION |author=Pavel Felgenhauer |date=7 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809134226/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2373294 |archivedate=9 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Russian peacekeepers, a Georgian sniper from near to the village of Prisi killed one South Ossetian militia member at about 18:17. South Ossetian ''de facto'' leader [[Eduard Kokoity]] claimed late that day that a &quot;sniper war&quot; was being conducted by Georgia and accused [[Ukraine]] and the [[United States]] of being responsible for this.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18871 |title=Six Die in S.Ossetia Shootout |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages on 1 August at the earliest, with a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers and other troops in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;shelling&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Is_The_Clock_Ticking_For_Saakashvili/1199512.html | publisher=RFE/RL |author=Brian Whitmore |title=Is The Clock Ticking For Saakashvili?' |date=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the night of 1/2 August, the worst outbreak of violence in the past four years happened. South Ossetia accused Georgia of firing first. South Ossetian authorities reported that the number of killed Ossetians was six (including one North Ossetian peacekeeper), and the number of injured was fifteen. Georgian Interior Ministry stated that the Georgian villages of Zemo Nikozi, Kvemo Nikozi, Nuli and Ergneti were shelled. The Georgian casualties were six injured civilians and one injured policeman. Georgian defense ministry official [[Mamuka Kurashvili]] said that the Georgians only responded to the South Ossetian shelling and suspected that Russian peacekeepers were also involved in the shelling of the Georgian villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;/&gt;

On 3 August, the Russian government said that the situation was becoming more and more dangerous. The South Ossetians began [[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]] from probable war into Russia, which resulted in twenty bus-loads of refugees leaving the region on the first day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1tv.ru/owa/win/ort6_main.main?p_news_title_id=125640&amp;p_news_razdel_id=9 |script-title=ru:Вывезли из-под огня.

It was reported on 3 August that five battalions of the Russian [[58th Army (Russia)|58th Army]] were moved to the vicinity of [[Roki Tunnel]] in [[North Ossetia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Talking Through Gritted Teeth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/19821-talking-through-gritted-teeth.html |title=Talking Through Gritted Teeth |publisher=BBC Monitoring |date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity said on 4 August that about 300 volunteers had arrived from North Ossetia to help fight the Georgians, and thousands more were expected from the [[North Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2008/08/04/volunteers/ |script-title=ru:В Цхинвали прибыли 300 добровольцев из Северной Осетии |publisher=Lenta.ru |date=4 August 2008 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgian minister [[Temur Iakobashvili]] travelled to South Ossetia to propose direct talks. He was not let into [[Tskhinvali]] and the separatists refused to meet him. Iakobashvili met with the commander of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces, Marat Kulakhmetov and Georgian commander Mamuka Qurashvili at the Ergneti checkpoint. Iakobashvili earlier had told a Georgian newspaper that the Georgian government would begin direct talks with the South Ossetian separatists &quot;without any conditions&quot;, but would only agree to &quot;a solution founded upon respect for Georgia's territorial integrity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Talking Through Gritted Teeth&quot;/&gt;

On 5 August, Georgian authorities had organised a tour for journalists and diplomats to demonstrate the separatist-caused damage. Russian [[Ambassador at Large|ambassador-at-large]] Yuri Popov declared that Russia would intervene on the side of South Ossetia. South Ossetian president Kokoity blamed Georgia of &quot;attempting to spark a full-scale war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7543099.stm |title=Russia vows to defend S Ossetia |publisher=BBC News |date=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Ossetian presidential envoy to Moscow, [[Dmitry Medoyev]], declared that volunteers were already arriving, primarily from North Ossetia, to South Ossetia. He said that the regions of North Caucasus and the Cossacks were ready to help South Ossetia. He claimed that Tskhinvali relied mostly on its own forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;dobrovoltsy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfax.ru/politics/news.asp?id=25175 |script-title=ru:В Южную Осетию уже прибывают добровольцы |publisher=Interfax |date=5 August 2008 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August, Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia agreed to hold negotiations on 7 August, with Georgian minister [[Temur Iakobashvili]] attending talks in Tskhinvali. However, Georgia still opposed to the format of the [[Joint Control Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Talking Through Gritted Teeth&quot;/&gt; The Georgian state minister for reintegration [[Temur Iakobashvili]] said that a meeting between him and Boris Chochiev was decided and chief Russian negotiator over South Ossetia, Yuri Popov, would be attending. However, later the South Ossetians denied any agreement for such meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;civil.ge6&quot;/&gt;

On 6 August, the South Ossetian Press and Information Committee reported that Boris Chochiev said that the South Ossetians had agreed to &quot;a consultative meeting&quot; in Tskhinvali on 7 August. However, later the South Ossetians refused to participate in bilateral talks, demanding a [[Joint Control Commission for Georgian–Ossetian Conflict Resolution|JCC]] session.&lt;ref name=&quot;civil.ge6&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18910 |title=S.Ossetia Rejects Talks |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August, it was reported that the South Ossetian claim of having killed twenty-nine Georgian servicemen in the clashes in the past week was not proven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Talking Through Gritted Teeth&quot;/&gt;

=== August 7 ===
[[File:Zahesi-2008-08-07.jpg|thumb|Georgian armoured vehicle in Zahesi on its way north in the late afternoon on August 7, 2008.]]
[[File:Refugees from south ossetia-alagir.jpg|thumb|right|Refugees from South Ossetia in a [[refugee camp]] in the town of [[Alagir]], [[North Ossetia]], Russia.]]

''[[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]]'' (NG) reported that events in South Ossetia could only be assessed as war. Starting with the night of 6–7 August, there was continuous fire. At 6 AM on the morning of 7 August, firing resumed. A reporter concluded that assault rifles, heavy artillery and grenade launchers were used. Tskhinvali hospital had been receiving the wounded all night. According to the Tskhinvali hospital, they received 14 wounded people. Anatoly Barankevich, the secretary of the Security Council of South Ossetia, claimed that the clashes began when the Georgians unsuccessfully attempted to seize a key height near the village Nuli on 6 August. According to Barankevich, Georgian special troops from the ministry of defense attempted to capture the Prisi Heights on the morning of 7 August. The hotel administrator in Tskhinvali refused to accept payment from a NG reporter, saying, &quot;Maybe, here something will happen, that you will have to leave prematurely. So the bank won't work, and we won't be able to refund your money.&quot; JPKF commander's assistant Vladimir Ivanov told ''NG'' that the peacekeepers had documented five illegal overflights of the Georgian Su-25 jets from the Gori district towards [[Java (town)|Java]] and three drones during the night of 6–7 August. ''Nezavisimaya Gazeta'' also reported that Russian troops were being pulled towards the Georgian border, however Russian military claimed that they continued their exercises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perevozkina&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ng.ru/politics/2008-08-08/1_war.html |script-title=ru:Это не конфликт, это – война |author=Marina Perevozkina |publisher=Nezavisimaya Gazeta |date=8 August 2008 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the phone calls intercepted by the Georgian intelligence, regular (non-peacekeeping) Russian military entered South Ossetia in the early hours of 7 August through the [[Roki Tunnel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTFreshev&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/world/europe/16georgia.html | publisher=The New York Times | first=C.J. | last=Chivers | title=Georgia Offers Fresh Evidence on War's Start | date=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, even the state-controlled Russian TV showed Abkhazia's ''de facto'' president [[Sergei Bagapsh]], who said at a meeting of the Abkhaz National Security Council: &quot;I have spoken to the president of South Ossetia. It has more or less stabilized now. A battalion from the [[North Caucasus Military District|North Caucasus District]] has entered the area.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/600/42/372391.htm |title=Moscow Claims Media War Win |publisher=[[The Moscow Times]] |author=Nikolaus von Twickel |date=17 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523210654/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/moscow-claims-media-war-win/372391.html |archivedate=23 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although South Ossetian separatists initially said in the morning that six people were wounded after fire exchange during the night and morning, later they said that the casualties were increased to eighteen. The Georgian Interior Ministry said the Georgian villages of Eredvi, Prisi, Avnevi, Dvani and Nuli were shelled on late 6 August and two Georgian peacekeepers were wounded. The South Ossetians claimed that fire recommenced at about 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18914 |title=20 People Injured in S.Ossetia Shooting |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Russia Today'', after Russian peacekeepers intervened in the conflict, fire exchange stopped for 40 minutes.

Temur Iakobashvili had refused any talks in the Joint Control Commission (JCC) format, since the commission &quot;is responsible for what is happening in the region,&quot; adding if Russian &quot;puppets&quot; would not be forced to negotiate then Russia's status as a mediator would be &quot;in doubt.&quot; A Russian co-chairman of the JCC, Yury Popov, said in Tbilisi he was going to visit Tskhinvali with Iakobashvili: &quot;We have not yet arranged a trip to Tskhinvali...The negotiations will be held if the situation allows it.&quot; South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity had earlier warned Popov that his visit to Tskhinvali would be &quot;dangerous&quot;. Georgian Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling on Russia to force the separatists to stop the systematic shelling and saying, &quot;Responsibility for the latest events lies with Russia.&quot; The Georgian diplomats said that mercenaries and military hardware were moving to South Ossetia through the [[Roki Tunnel]]. In the afternoon South Ossetia claimed that lots of Georgian troops were advancing towards them.

Saakashvili called for negotiations &quot;in any type of format,&quot; reaffirmed the offer of &quot;unrestricted [[autonomy]]&quot; for South Ossetia, proposed that Russia should become the guarantor of that solution, offered a general [[amnesty]], and pleaded for international help to stop the hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;unilateral&quot;/&gt; Ceasefire was announced after a skirmish that had killed up to ten Georgian peacekeepers and civilians, according to the Georgian authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief_truce&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=a8277279-9a18-4612-987f-443280dc5a52 |title=Georgia troops and rebels clash after brief truce |publisher=Canada.com |date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia regarded the ceasefire as an attempt to buy time to deploy Georgian forces for an offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost.com&quot;/&gt; The separatists shelled [[Tamarasheni]] and Prisi after Saakashvili's ceasefire. They destroyed Avnevi and a police station in [[Kurta, Georgia|Kurta]] (seat of the [[Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia]]). The escalated attacks forced civilians to flee the Georgian villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jamestown Goals&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shelling&quot;/&gt; Georgian Interior Ministry official later told the Russian newspaper ''[[Kommersant]]'' (on 8 August) that after this, &quot;it became clear&quot; that South Ossetians wouldn't stop firing and the Georgian casualties were 10 killed and 50 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;rmd_source_1&quot;/&gt;

After the midnight, the Georgian government stated that &quot;hundreds&quot; of fighters and military hardware had passed through Roki Tunnel. In the early hours of the morning, President of [[North Ossetia–Alania]], [[Taimuraz Mamsurov]] told the [[Interfax]] news agency that hundreds of armed &quot;[[volunteer]]s&quot; from North Ossetia were heading to the battleground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18945 |title=Hundreds of ‘Volunteers’ Head for S.Ossetia – N.Ossetian Leader |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 04:45 MSK, Georgian State Minister for Reintegration Temur Iakobashvili announced that Tskhinvali was nearly surrounded.

Georgian authorities stated that they began using aviation only after three Russian Su-24 planes had flown into the Georgian airspace at 11:00. According to ''Kommersant'', Georgian official said that by that time Russian peacekeepers had not participated in the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;rmd_source_1&quot;/&gt;

It was reported that at about 11:30, four Russian aircraft intruded into Georgian airspace and dropped a bomb near the city of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] with no casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18957 |title=Official: Warplane Drops Bomb Outside Gori |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shota Utiashvili, a spokesman for the Georgian Interior ministry, dismissed Russian media report that Georgians had entered Tskhinvali and said that Georgia wanted &quot;to give time to the remaining civilians to leave Tskhinvali,&quot; adding &quot;if the need arises&quot;, then Georgians would move in. Utiashvili said that Georgian troops were fighting against two Russian convoys of trucks moving towards Tskhinvali. Eduard Kokoity said: &quot;We are in full control of the capital city.

Russia did not agree to cease hostilities at a third meeting of the UN Security Council on the crisis. &quot;A ceasefire would not be a solution. The fighting is still going on.

Alexander Lomaya, Secretary of National Security Council of Georgia, had said conflict began because Russia aimed to &quot;thwart its neighbors’ movement toward Western society and Western values&quot;, adding &quot;If the world is not able to stop Russia here, then Russian tanks and Russian paratroopers can appear in every European capital.&quot; Georgian officials admitted that Russian reaction surprised them.

However, when Anatoly Nogovitsyn, colonel general in the Russian Ministry of Defense, was asked whether Russia was in a state of war, he replied that was not the case. Georgian health minister had said that Georgian casualties were more than 80, 40 of which were civilians killed in the bombing of Gori.

Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze said that although Georgian president Saakashvili had signed the four-point plan, Georgia would remain &quot;prepared for everything&quot; until Russia actually suspended hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;hurriyet&quot;/&gt;

=== August 13 ===
By 2 am, Medvedev and Saakashvili had agreed on a peace plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;accord_withdrawal&quot;/&gt; Russian troops would have to withdraw to their &quot;normal bases of encampment&quot; meanwhile being able to &quot;implement additional security measures.&quot; This agreement caused an American official to state later that such unclear meaning &quot;would allow the Russians to do almost anything.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bush_sending_aid&quot;/&gt; French President Nicolas Sarkozy said at a press conference in Tbilisi that both Georgia and Russia accepted the peace plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;sky_smokescreen&quot;/&gt;

Parts of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], a strategic central Georgian city, was occupied by a Russian tank battalion several hours after the ceasefire agreement. Talks of a possible Russian advance on Tbilisi began.&lt;ref name=&quot;bush_sending_aid&quot;/&gt; The head of [[National Security Council of Georgia]] said that 50 Russian tanks had entered Gori.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap_russians_gori&quot;/&gt;

Abkhaz ''de facto'' president Sergei Bagapsh arrived in the Kodori gorge by helicopter on the morning. He declared that the Abkhaz authorities had retaken last Abkhaz territory controlled by Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;1killed&quot;/&gt; Despite earlier Russian claims that the separatists themselves had expelled Georgian troops from the gorge, Anatoly Nogovitsyn said on 13 August that Georgian troops had been disarmed by Russian peacekeepers. Anatoly Nogovitsyn claimed that there still were sporadic clashes in South Ossetia.&lt;ref name=&quot;violating_truce&quot;/&gt;

Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] said that Russian forces in Georgia continued their presence to support peacekeepers and Georgian troops had abandoned &quot;a major arsenal of armaments and military equipment&quot; that needed to be guarded. Russians would provide the residents of Gori with food, he said. General Vyacheslav Nikolayevich of the Pskov Airborne Division had claimed Russian troops would remain on the outskirts of Gori instead of entering the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;bush_sending_aid&quot;/&gt;

A reporter for ''The Guardian'' said that &quot;the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous&quot;, and that Chechen, Cossack and Ossetian irregulars were following advancing Russian military and burning Georgian villages near [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]]. Anatoliy Nogovitsyn had claimed that Russians entered Gori only to negotiate with the local authorities, who were found to be absent, but there were no Russian tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia6|title=Georgian villages burned and looted as Russian tanks advance|author=Luke Harding|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rian.ru/osetia_news/20080813/150342553.html |script-title=ru:Миротворцы опровергли утверждения об атаках на Гори |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=13 August 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rian.ru/osetia_mm/20080812/150322734.html |script-title=ru:Российская армия не атаковала Гори - Генштаб ВС РФ |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=12 August 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky News correspondents confirmed that Russian tanks were in Gori.

''The New York Times'' reported Czech journalists were robbed and that &quot;almost completely empty&quot; Gori was &quot;firmly occupied&quot;. That day, ''The New York Times'' interviewed Russian commanders, who did not view their presence in Gori, the city where [[Joseph Stalin]] was born, as a violation of the ceasefire. One Russian soldier even said, &quot;If [Saakashvili] does not understand the situation, we’ll have to go farther. It’s just 60 kilometers to Tbilisi.&quot; Another Russian officer confirmed attacks on Georgian villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/world/europe/14gori.html |title=Russian Soldiers Occupying Stalin’s Birth City Are Buoyed by Battle With Georgia |publisher=The New York Times |date=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch researchers reported that militias were responsible for &quot;terrifying scenes of destruction&quot; in ethnic Georgian villages.

American president [[George W. Bush]] sent American troops on a humanitarian mission. This was hailed by Georgian president Saakashvili, which labelled the relief operation as a &quot;turning point&quot;. Saakashvili assessed the American operation as a defence of Georgian ports and airports, however American officials denied this, with one senior official saying, &quot;We won’t be protecting the airport or seaport, but we’ll certainly protect our assets if we need to.&quot; The first American [[C-17 Globemaster III|C-17 Globemaster]] aircraft arrived in Tbilisi that day and brought humanitarian and medical supplies.

Although journalists had reported that Russian military violated the ceasefire, Anatoly Nogovitsyn claimed on 13 August that it was Georgia in violation of ceasefire. According to Al Jazeera, &quot;Russia's military on Wednesday repeatedly denied that any troops were inside Gori.&quot; Georgian president Saakashvili had accused Russia of &quot;Balkan-type and World War II-type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2008/08/2008813153517926662.html|title=Russian forces sink Georgian ships|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia said that &quot;despite the assurances from the Georgian side that they have ended all military activities, Russian troops shot down a second Georgian drone over Tskhinvali earlier today.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;violate&quot;/&gt; Georgia reported that 175 Georgians had died from the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;violating_truce&quot;/&gt;

14 August had been announced as a day of mourning for the South Ossetian victims in Abkhazia.&lt;ref name=&quot;1killed&quot;/&gt;

It was reported on early 14 August that there was calm in Gori.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_handover&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7560100.stm|title=Russians begin Georgia handover|publisher=BBC News|date=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about 10:00, joint patrols of Georgian police and Russian forces in Gori was ordered by Russian major general while Russian troops were preparing to withdraw.&lt;ref name=&quot;vows_retort&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/world/europe/15georgia.html |title=Russia Vows to Support Two Enclaves, in Retort to Bush |publisher=The New York Times |date=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Interfax'' reported at 12:10 MSK that the Russian army gave back control of Gori to the Georgian Police. The representative of the Russian Ministry of Defence, major-general [[Vyacheslav Borisov]] claimed that the rumours about damaged town and marauding did not correspond to reality. Secretary of National Defence Сouncil of Georgia Alexander Lomaia, who was in Gori negotiating with the Russians, said on &quot;Rustavi-2&quot; TV on the live broadcast that the situation in Gori was calm and Russian army only did patrolling job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interfax.ru/politics/txt.asp?id=27186 |script-title=ru:Покидая Гори |date=14 August 2008 |publisher=Interfax |language=Russian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814174250/http://www.interfax.ru/politics/txt.asp?id=27186 |archivedate=14 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 13:00, joint patrol efforts in Gori broke down due to apparent tensions among personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;vows_retort&quot;/&gt; Although the Russian troops were ready for the handover of Gori, they postponed it. It was alleged that this happened due to Moscow assessing the U.S. humanitarian mission, which meant support for President Saakashvili. A stand-off took place near Gori between the Georgian police and the Russian forces with the Russian tanks arriving as reinforcements and the Georgians left the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia destroying&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/2558812/Russia-destroying-military-bases-in-Georgia.html |title=Russia destroying military bases in Georgia |publisher=The Telegraph |date=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that near Gori five explosions took place.

Witnesses in [[Poti]] reported that Russian tanks had entered the town and were looting or destroying infrastructure. Russia denied that its troops were in Poti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/asiaCrisis/idUSLE126209 |title=Russian tanks in Georgia's Poti - witnesses |publisher=Reuters |date=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatoly Nogovitsyn later said that Russians were gathering intelligence in Poti. It was reported that some of the troops occupying Zugdidi wore blue peacekeeping helmets while others wore green camouflage helmets.&lt;ref name=&quot;gates_rice&quot;/&gt;

President Medvedev met with South Ossetian and Abkhaz leaders in Moscow on 14 August. Georgian parliament decided to withdraw Georgia from the CIS.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_handover&quot;/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] had only confirmed the death of 44 South Ossetian civilians and accused Russia of reporting false casualty figures. Two flights delivered the U.S. humanitarian aid on a C-17 military plane to Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia destroying&quot;/&gt;

U.S. Secretary of State Rice said that day &quot;the provisional ceasefire that was agreed to really must go into place. And that means that military activities have to cease&quot;. Although Defence Secretary Gates accused the Russians of going &quot;far beyond reasserting the autonomy of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,&quot; Gates nonetheless said that there was &quot;no prospect&quot; of US troops being deployed.&lt;ref name=&quot;gates_rice&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/14/georgia.russia7 |title=Georgia conflict could set back Russia's US relations 'for years' |publisher=The Guardian |date=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agence France-Presse]] reported that amid the ruins and tanks in the South Ossetian capital, the remaining residents shared insufficient goods and wondered why humanitarian aid promised by Russia had not arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/world/south-ossetians-wait-for-aid-in-bombedout-capital/2008/08/15/1218307168921.html|title=South Ossetians wait for aid in bombed-out capital|publisher=Brisbane Times |date=15 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reuters]] reported that Russian forces had pushed to {{convert|34|mi|km}} from Tbilisi, the closest during the war, and stopped in Igoeti at the same time as [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] was in Tbilisi meeting President Saakashvili. According to the report, 17 APCs and 200 soldiers marched towards Igoeti. The convoy included a military ambulance, snipers, rocket-propelled grenades and initially, three helicopters.&lt;ref name=&quot;34_miles&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUSLF7284720080815 |title=Russian convoy moves deeper inside Georgia: witness |publisher=Reuters |date=15 August 2008 |first=James |last=Kilner}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgian troops and police were nearby where the Russians had stopped, but did not resist them. According to the [[International New York Times|International Herald Tribune]] (IHT), the move &quot;opened a new security vacuum between Gori and [Igoeti], creating fresh targets&quot; for &quot;looters and armed gangs in uniform - many of them apparently Ossetians, Chechens and Cossacks - [who] have operated behind the army's path, ransacking villages largely vacated by fleeing civilians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;iht_16Aug&quot;/&gt;

After about five-hour meeting with Condoleezza Rice, President Saakashvili signed an EU-brokered ceasefire.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_Rice&quot;/&gt; Rice in Tbilisi declared: &quot;Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once. This is no longer 1968.&quot; Saakashvili described Russians as &quot;21st century barbarians&quot;. He blamed the West for provoking the conflict by not properly reacting to Russia's previous military acts and not allowing Georgia to become a NATO member as soon as possible. The Russian General Staff said at its daily news briefing on the same day that no shooting occurred in the previous 24 hours. Russian ground troops were mostly based around Gori.&lt;ref name=&quot;justification&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL768040420080815 |title=Bush criticizes Moscow's actions in Georgia |publisher=Reuters |date=15 August 2008 |author1=David Alexander |author2=Oleg Shchedrov |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828054952/http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL768040420080815?sp=true |archivedate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] met Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in [[Sochi]].

Amidst what the Associated Press described as &quot;intense diplomacy&quot; to pressure Russia to withdraw from Georgia, Interfax News Agency quoted Russian General Anatoly Nogovitsyn as saying that Poland &quot;is exposing itself to a strike&quot; by welcoming an American missile battery. Associated Press reported that Gori &quot;is key to when – or if – Russia will honour the terms of a ceasefire&quot;.

Georgian president Saakashvili said that &quot;Georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory.&quot; Earlier, the residents of Zugdidi had protested against the Russian occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080817/ap_on_re_eu/georgia_russia |title=Russia: Will begin pullout from Georgia on Monday |publisher=Associated Press |date=17 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820012522/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080817/ap_on_re_eu/georgia_russia |archivedate=20 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported that Russia had deployed [[OTR-21 Tochka|SS-21 Scarab]] missile launchers to South Ossetia on 15 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/18/world/europe/18georgia.html?hp |title=Pledging to Leave Georgia, Russia Tightens Its Grip |publisher=The New York Times |date=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== August 18 ===
Anatoly Nogovitsyn from the Russian General Staff said around noon that Russia had started to pull troops from Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,572751,00.html |title=Russischer Generalstab meldet Truppenabzug |publisher=Der Spiegel |date=18 August 2008 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RIA Novosti]] reported that Russian military equipment was being pulled out of the South Ossetian capital Tskinvali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080818/116103462.html |title=Russian troops start pullout from South Ossetia capital |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four Russian armored vehicles in the village of Igoeti appeared to be moving to the village of Lamiskana, however they were resisted by Georgian police, which had made a barrier with their vehicles. The Russian general ordered his soldiers to drive over the police cars, however the Georgian policemen managed to get out of the cars before the Russians drove over their cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-62034|title=Russian tanks drive over Georgian police vehicles|publisher=CNN iReport|date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late on afternoon, Russian military units were still holding the center of Georgia and Russian military convoys were moving in and out of Gori. In western Georgia, there was no signs of a Russian withdrawal from Zugdidi by mid-afternoon, but a convoy of 12 Russian military vehicles had rolled south toward the port of Poti in the morning. Russian troops were still occupying an air base and other positions in Senaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/117/story/49042.html |title=No sign that Russians have begun to leave Georgia |publisher=McClatchy DC |date=18 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520083854/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/08/18/49042/no-sign-that-russians-have-begun.html |archivedate=20 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Foreign ministry stated that according to 1999 document of the Joint Control Commission, peacekeepers were permitted to operate a &quot;security corridor&quot; extending about {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} in each direction from South Ossetian boundary, thus including parts of the main Georgian east-west highway. However, Russian forces actually had never crossed into Georgia proper before the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;senaki&quot;/&gt;

=== August 19 ===

''The Wall Street Journal'' said Russian forces had seized control of [[Poti]] on the morning, which is the economically significant port. Georgian soldiers in Poti were captured by the Russian forces and taken to the base in Senaki four hours later. The Russians also captured five American jeeps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121913118324652571.html |title=Russia Briefly Seizes Georgian Port |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, American [[Humvee]]s moved down the road to Abkhazia. A top Russian military official claimed that armed Georgian soldiers in Poti were driving the Humvees and were detained at a checkpoint, however the Georgians said that 21 Georgian soldiers were guarding the port from looting, and that American Humvees used in a joint exercise were packed in a container to be shipped back to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;senaki&quot;/&gt; An Azerbaijani news source quoted a Poti port official as saying, &quot;All workers were expelled from the port [yesterday at night]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.trend.az/capital/energy/1273609.html |title=Activity of Georgian Black Sea Port of Poti Paralyzed |publisher=Trend |date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisoners of war were exchanged by Russia and Georgia. A Georgian official said that although his country exchanged five Russian servicemen for fifteen Georgians (including two civilians), Georgia suspected that Russia still held two more Georgians.&lt;ref name=&quot;pows&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Georgia/idUSLJ34288420080819|title=Russian, Georgian forces exchange prisoners |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=19 August 2008 |author1=Margarita Antidze |author2=Matt Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange took place in Igoeti and two of the exchanged Russians were pilots. Earlier, Russia had claimed that Russian troops were pulling back while Georgia was not complying with the ceasefire.&lt;ref name=&quot;nato-igoeti&quot;/&gt;

NATO countries convened for an emergency summit in [[Brussels]] to find some consensuses on a response towards Russia in regard to the conflict in Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;nato-igoeti&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7569357.stm|title=Nato holds Georgia crisis talks|publisher=BBC News|date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov levelled accusations at NATO of being &quot;unobjective and biased&quot; in maintaining support for a &quot;criminal regime&quot; that was &quot;failing.&quot; Russian president Medvedev had told French president Sarkozy that the withdrawal would be complete by 21–22 August, however 500 Russian soldiers would guard South Ossetian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7571104.stm |title=Russia Hits Back at Nato warning |publisher=BBC News |date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported that Russian troops were patrolling villages in western Georgia with tanks and armored personnel carriers daily. Russians had deployed artillery along major roads between Poti and Abkhazia. Reinforced trenches for a Russian checkpoint north of Gori was being built by engineering platoon and Russian armored vehicles were overlooking Gori and Igoeti from high ground. Most of the conflict zone was reportedly in need of water and food. Georgian villagers were hiding in fear of looters.&lt;ref name=&quot;senaki&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/world/europe/20georgia.html | publisher=The New York Times | first1=Michael | last1=Schwirtz | first2=Ellen | last2=Barry | title=Russia Sends Mixed Signs on Pullout From Georgia | date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfax reported that the head of Russian Federal Security Service said that according to intelligence reports, Georgia planned terrorist attacks in southern Russia, and security was increased at transportation hubs, industrial plants and densely populated areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;senaki&quot;/&gt; Martin Nesirky, a spokesman for the OSCE, said that OSCE would deploy 20 international monitors in addition to 8 already present in South Ossetia, who would begin arriving on 21 August and be let in the area adjacent to South Ossetia.&lt;ref name=&quot;senaki&quot;/&gt;

=== August 20 ===

The [[United Nations Security Council]] met at 16:15 [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] on 19 August to hear briefings about the situation, including brief statements of [[Lynn Pascoe]] about human rights abuses and relief shipments to the conflict area, and the promise of a permanent Russian military base in South Ossetia. The Georgian ambassador reported cases of destruction of their civilian and military infrastructure and reported a [[cyber attack]] from Russia. The Russian ambassador accused other parties of engaging in &quot;propaganda&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undemocracy.com/securitycouncil/meeting_5961 |title=Security Council meeting 5961 |date=19 August 2008 |publisher=UNdemocracy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823172709/http://www.undemocracy.com/securitycouncil/meeting_5961 |archivedate=23 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August, a French-drafted UN Security Council resolution was not passed because of Russian resistance and Vitaly Churkin said, &quot;It's a waste of time because the process of the withdrawal of Russian forces will continue.&quot; A claim was made by an official from the Poti port that the Russian military had withdrawn after blowing up a vessel and capturing military equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_20_08_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7571506.stm |title=Russia rejects UN Georgia Draft |publisher=BBC News |date=20 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia reduced initial civilian casualty figures of 1,600 people for the conflict to 133 ethnic Ossetian civilians listed as dead. Russia also reduced the number of its killed military to 64, but increased the number of its wounded military to more than 300. Georgia said that 160 Georgian soldiers were killed and 300 were missing. International Criminal Court stated that it was analysing the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7572635.stm |title=Russia scales down Georgia toll |publisher=BBC News |date=20 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== August 21 ===

Russia's emergencies ministry declared in a statement, &quot;A total of 17,912 people returned in the period August 12–20.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20080821/116184724.html |title=Russia says some 18,000 refugees return to S.

Russian forces still continued to occupy Gori and Igoeti. Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov repeated Medvedev's claim that Russian troops would withdraw to South Ossetia by the end of 22 August. Commander of Russian land forces, General Vladimir Boldyrev, claimed that withdrawal of troops not manning the security zones to Russia would last for 10 days. Near Poti, an AP photographer and TV crew were detained by the Russian soldiers and their equipment was confiscated. The residents of Poti protested against the Russian occupation. Associated Press reported that &quot;tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks were seen moving in both directions on the road from Gori to Tskhinvali.&quot; There were reports of Georgian villages being looted and burned. Conductor [[Valery Gergiev]] held the concert during the night in front of the South Ossetian parliament in Tskhinvali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080821/ap_on_re_eu/georgia_russia |title=Russians dig in but still promise Georgia pullout |date=21 August 2008 |publisher=Associated Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825004203/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080821/ap_on_re_eu/georgia_russia |archivedate=25 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American President George Bush told Georgian President Saakashvili during their phone conversation that the United States sought to end the Russian &quot;siege&quot; of Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;bush_igoeti&quot;/&gt;

=== August 22 ===

Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti, and Georgian police advanced towards Gori. Colonel-general Nogovitsyn demonstrated to reporters the map of the &quot;zone of responsibility&quot; that would be established in Georgia after the military withdrawal. Novogitsyn commented on the Russian military presence on parts of the highway around Gori by saying that &quot;if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces with units from the Russian peacekeepers’ contingent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bush_igoeti&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4589586.ece | publisher=The Times | first=Tony | last=Halpin | title=Russian troops in partial pullout keeping checkpoints within Georgia | date=23 August 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827213127/www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4589586.ece |archivedate=27 Aug 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia had withdrawn most troops from Georgia by the evening to Abkhazia and South Ossetia and Georgia's main east-west highway was effectively reopened. ''The New York Times'' reported: &quot;The Russian incursion into Georgia had already energized the world’s corps of military attachés, who have been provided a rare chance to see the Russian Army operating in the field. [...] And many Russian troops, after several years of emphasis by former President Vladimir V. Putin on developing units of volunteers and not conscripts, looked fit and alert.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;23georgia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/world/europe/23georgia.html |title=Russia Pulls the Bulk of Its Forces Out of Georgia |author=C.J. Chivers |publisher=The New York Times |date=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia claimed that its promised troop pullout from Georgia was complete and announced that Russia would permanently maintain a large buffer zone near South Ossetia and Abkhazia. According to a White House spokesman, American President Bush and French President Sarkozy had agreed that Russia was not in compliance with the ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.net/en/article/22/08/2008/us-disputes-russia-s-claims-of-georgia-withdrawal/ |title=US disputes Russia’s claims of Georgia withdrawal |publisher=euronews |date=22 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823055245/http://www.euronews.net/en/article/22/08/2008/us-disputes-russia-s-claims-of-georgia-withdrawal/ |archivedate=23 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kremlin, however, said in a formal announcement on 23 August, that President Sarkozy, in a telephone conversation with Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev|Medvedev]], had shown satisfaction with the Russian withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n150284 |title=Sarkozy satisfied with implementation of Russian troops withdrawal from Georgia plan |date=23 August 2008 |publisher=FOCUS Information Agency |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916233813/http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n150284 |archivedate=16 September 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Units of the Georgian Army returned to Gori. Russian military was pulling out from Zugdidi to Abkhazia. Russian troops left the military base in Senaki after looting it for more than a week. However, Russian checkpoints remained near Gori as well as in so-called buffer zones near the borders with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and two Russian observer posts remained near Poti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/world/europe/24georgia.html | publisher=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Schwirtz | title=Georgia Prepares for Refugees; Russians Declare Pullback Finished | date=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a news conference General Anatoly Nogovitsyn insisted, &quot;These patrols were envisaged in the international agreement. Poti is outside of the security zone, but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in Hummers.&quot; Nogovitsyn claimed that Georgia was rearming for &quot;another act of aggression&quot;. He claimed that &quot;2,100 people&quot; were killed in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=RIA Novosti |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080823/116235138.html |title=Russian troops to patrol Georgian port of Poti - Gen.Staff |date=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== August 24 ===

With Russian forces still within the port of Poti, a US warship arrived with aid supplies in [[Batumi]] and two more warships were expected to arrive. The supplies delivered by the destroyer USS McFaul would be unloaded by a floating crane since the warship did not fit into the port. The BBC reported that &quot;apart from delivering aid, the arrival of US naval personnel is undoubtedly intended to send a signal to the Russians - that America is serious about its support for Georgia.&quot; Georgia stated that day that a fuel train exploded near Gori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7579506.stm |title=US Warship reaches Georgian port |publisher=BBC News |date=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/us-warship-docks-in-black-sea-port-with-georgia-aid-907401.html |title=US warship docks in Black Sea port with Georgia aid |publisher=The Independent |date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== August 25 ===

The Deputy Defense Minister of Abkhazia, Anatoly Zaitsev, claimed that 8,000 Georgian troops were massing at the border with Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regnum.ru/english/1046150.html |title=Georgian troops consolidated near Kodori Gorge |publisher=[[REGNUM News Agency|Regnum]] |date=25 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827212812/http://www.regnum.ru/english/1046150.html |archivedate=27 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abkhaz and South Ossetian leaders addressed the Russian Parliament before the vote at extraordinary sittings, which had been formally convened by separatist appeals. Both houses of the Russian Parliament passed unanimous non-binding resolutions calling on Russian President Medvedev to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The US state department said that such action would be &quot;a violation of Georgian territorial integrity&quot; and &quot;inconsistent with international law&quot;. American president Bush said, &quot;I call on Russia's leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions.&quot; German, British and Italian leaders were also concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7580386.stm|title=Russian MPs back Georgia's rebels|date=25 August 2008|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== August 26 ===

Russian President Medvedev signed two Presidential decrees recognizing the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia as sovereign independent states. He authorized the drafting of treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with authorities in Sukhumi and Tskhinvali.&lt;ref name=&quot;26 _August&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undemocracy.com/securitycouncil/meeting_5969 |title=Security Council meeting 5969 | date=28 August 2008 |publisher=UNdemocracy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913200224/http://www.undemocracy.com/securitycouncil/meeting_5969 |archivedate=13 September 2008}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
