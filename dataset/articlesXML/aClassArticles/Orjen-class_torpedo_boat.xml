The '''''Orjen'' class''' of eight [[motor torpedo boat]]s was built for the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1936 and 1939 at the [[Lürssen|Lürssen Shipyard]]. They were based on the German [[E-boat|''S-2'']] motor torpedo boats. At the start of the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]], two boats managed to escape to [[Alexandria]] in Egypt where they continued serving with Allied forces, including in operations against [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces in Syria. The remaining ones were captured by Italian forces and commissioned in the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Italian Navy) with modified armament; they were also used by the Italians as the model for the Italian-built [[CRDA 60 t motor torpedo boat]]s.

At the time of the [[Italian Armistice]] in September 1943, two boats were scuttled by their crews. The four surviving Italian boats were taken over by German forces and commissioned in the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (German Navy), serving largely in the [[Aegean Sea]] until they were finally scuttled in October 1944 as the Germans withdrew from Greece. The two boats that had escaped to the Allies in 1941 returned to Yugoslavia after the war. They were commissioned in the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and remained in service until the early 1960s.

== Background and description ==
During the early 1930s, [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] faced an economic [[recession]] brought on by the [[Great Depression]], which was further complicated by internal political instability.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|pp=171–176}} In the mid-1930s, the Yugoslav government sought to improve relations with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] to create new economic opportunities for the country.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|pp=182–184}} Such cooperation resulted in the acquisition of new German-constructed ships for the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{lang-sh|Jugoslavenska kraljevska ratna mornarica}}, JKRM), which had previously obtained ships from [[France]] and [[Great Britain]]. The first such deal came in 1936, when the navy ordered eight [[motor torpedo boat]]s that were to be built by the [[Lürssen]] shipyard, based on the existing German design of the [[E-boat|S–2]] class.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=356}}

The boats measured {{convert|28|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in [[length overall]], with a {{convert|4.3|m|ftin|abbr=on}} beam and a draught of {{convert|1.51|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Fully loaded, they displaced {{convert|61.7|t|LT}}. Main propulsion consisted of three [[Daimler-Benz]] 12-cylinder [[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke petrol engines]] rated at {{convert|3300|hp|abbr=on}}, giving the boats a maximum speed of {{convert|31|kn|abbr=on}}. A Maybach engine rated at {{convert|100|hp|abbr=on}} was also installed for use when cruising,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=359}}{{sfn|Paterson|2015|p=215}} and the boats had a crew of sixteen.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=359}} Armament consisted of two {{convert|550|mm|in|abbr=on|lk=in|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s and a {{convert|40|mm|ftin|abbr=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] gun on the [[stern]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=359}}{{sfn|Paterson|2015|p=215}}

== Service history ==

=== Royal Yugoslav Navy service ===
At the start of the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]], seven of the eight ''Orjen''-class boats and the two smaller {{sclass-|Uskok|torpedo boat|0}} boats were assigned to the 2nd Torpedo Division in [[Šibenik]], with ''Velebit'' as division flagship. At the time, ''Orjen'' was being refitted at the Naval Arsenal at [[Tivat]] in the [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 11 April, a naval force consisting of several ''Orjen''-class boats, among other ships, was expected to assist ground forces in attacking the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] which the Yugoslav High Command feared would be used as a [[bridgehead]] during the invasion.{{sfn|Divine|1944|p=205}}{{sfn|Rahten|2010|p=104}} The attack, however, never materialized and the Yugoslav ships were instead attacked by Italian bombers, forcing them to retreat to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Divine|1944|p=205}}{{sfn|Tucker|2012|p=819}} By 17 April, the complete collapse of Yugoslav defences was imminent, prompting the commander of the 3rd Torpedo Boat Division, [[Ivan Kern]], to suggest that ''Durmitor'', ''Kajmakčalan'', ''Dinara'', ''Triglav'', ''Rudnik'' and ''Suvobor'' sail out of the Bay of Kotor to evade capture by the Axis and continue their fight alongside Allied forces.{{sfn|Rahten|2010|p=106}} Kern approached the commanding officers of ''Durmitor'', ''Kajmakčalan'', ''Rudnik'' and ''Suvobor'' with the idea, only to be rejected by all of them.{{sfn|Rahten|2010|pp=106–107}}

At the same time, saboteurs caused a fire on ''Triglav'', further eroding crew morale already under pressure from [[desertion]]. Elsewhere in the Bay of Kotor, [[Milan Spasić]] and [[Sergej Mašera]] died blowing up the [[Yugoslav destroyer Zagreb|destroyer ''Zagreb'']] to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Following this, Kern decided to sail out with just two boats, ''Durmitor'' and ''Kajmakčalan'', which he deemed had the most trustworthy crews, leaving the Bay of Kotor on 17 April.{{sfn|Rahten|2010|p=107}} Because both boats were in poor condition and overloaded with personnel, the maximum speed they could achieve was 29 knots. Before passing through the [[Strait of Otranto]], the boats successfully evaded two groups of Italian ships. They arrived at [[Navarino Bay]] in southern Greece on 19 April and at [[Souda Bay]] in [[Crete]] on 22 April, where they were tasked with escorting a [[convoy]] to [[Alexandria]], protecting it from possible attacks from [[Junkers Ju 87]] [[dive-bomber]]s. Once in Alexandria, they joined with other JKRM vessels and aircraft that had managed to escape, forming the JKRM in exile. The two boats were first tasked with patrolling the outside of the harbour in anticipation of an attack by Axis coastal craft.{{sfn|Divine|1944|pp=207–211}} In June they operated against [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces in Syria.{{sfn|Thomas|McCouaig|1991|p=35}} In 1944 they were reported as being tasked with escorting convoys between Alexandria and [[Port Said]].{{sfn|Royal Yugoslav Navy|16 August 1944}} However, with time the serviceability of the boats became a problem because of the lack of spare parts needed for their German-built engines.{{sfn|Divine|1944|pp=207–211}}

=== Axis service ===
The remaining six boats were captured by Italian forces and commissioned in the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Italian Navy), receiving designations ''MAS&amp;nbsp;3–8&amp;nbsp;D'', with &quot;[[MAS (boat)|MAS]]&quot; standing for ''Motoscafo Armato Silurante'' (Torpedo Armed Motorboat) and the prefix ''D'' denoting they were captured in [[Dalmatia]]. The captured boats were used as a model for the Italian-built [[CRDA 60 t motor torpedo boat]]s, which were designated as ''Motosilurante'' (&quot;MS&quot;, or Motor Torpedo Boat) to distinguish them from the smaller ''MAS'' boats already in Italian service. ''MAS&amp;nbsp;3–5&amp;nbsp;D'' formed the 24th MAS Squadron and were deployed in the [[Aegean Sea]]. The designations of the former Yugoslav boats were changed again in July 1942 to conform with the new &quot;MS&quot; prefix, and new numerals from 41 to 46. During their Italian service, the boats were re-armed. On ''MS&amp;nbsp;41''–''44'', the original {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on|in}} gun and a {{convert|15|mm|abbr=on|in}} [[machine gun]] were both removed in favor of two single-mount {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on|in}} [[Breda Model 35]] L/65{{refn|L/65 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/65 gun is 65 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 65 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns. On ''MS&amp;nbsp;45''–''46'', the armament consisted of one 40&amp;nbsp;mm L/43 gun and one 15&amp;nbsp;mm L/38 machine gun. The boats were also equipped to carry 12 to 20 [[depth charge]]s. In Italian service the crew was increased to 22.{{sfn|Fraccaroli|1974|p=176}}{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=156}}

Following the [[Italian Armistice]] in September 1943, at least four of the boats were taken over by the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (German Navy). ''MS 41'' was scuttled by its crew on 9 September at [[Monfalcone]]. Sources are inconsistent regarding the boat's ultimate fate; according to Italian sources it was raised and repaired by German forces before being sunk by a [[Naval mine|mine]] between Porto Corsini and Porto Garibaldi in October 1944. German sources, on the other hand, claim it was never commissioned by the ''Kriegsmarine''. ''MS&amp;nbsp;45'' was also scuttled by its crew just a few days later, on 18 September at [[Cattolica]].{{sfn|Fraccaroli|1974|pp=176–177}} The remaining four boats, ''MS&amp;nbsp;42''–''44'' and ''MS&amp;nbsp;46'', were commissioned with the ''Kriegsmarine'' as ''S&amp;nbsp;601''–''604'' respectively.{{sfn|Paterson|2015|pp=215–216}} They formed part of the 24th S-Boat Flotilla. Soon after their acquisition by the Germans, ''S&amp;nbsp;601'' and ''S&amp;nbsp;603'' were travelling from [[Piraeus]] in occupied Greece to the Bay of Kotor when ''S 603'' suffered from a main engine failure. While operating on her cruising engine, she and ''S&amp;nbsp;601'' were attacked by four  [[Supermarine Spitfire]] [[fighter-bomber]]s of the [[Royal Air Force]]. One of the attackers was shot down by ''S&amp;nbsp;601'', but both boats were damaged, and several crew on both boats were killed or wounded. They put into [[Corfu]] for repairs. On 22 February 1944, the two boats attempted to continue their voyage, but two carburetter fires on ''S&amp;nbsp;603'' forced a return to port. This was followed by a fire during a test run, and several crew were badly burnt. Another attempt to leave began on 14 March, but the cruising engine on ''S 603'' exploded, injuring two crewmen. Due to rough seas in the central Adriatic, the two boats were diverted to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], with ''S&amp;nbsp;601'' towing her disabled sister boat. In the meantime, ''S 602'' and ''S 604'' had also been sent to Salamis.{{sfn|Paterson|2015|pp=220–221}}

By late March, ''S&amp;nbsp;601'' was conducting anti-partisan operations following a British [[Special Boat Service]] raid on Stampalia. On 29 March, she intercepted and scuttled a {{convert|60|t|adj=on}} sailing vessel carrying fuel near [[Oxeia]]. The following day she transported 20 German soldiers and towed the artillery lighter ''MAL12'' to Oxeia to assist with mopping-up operations, but by the time they arrived, the enemy was gone. In late March, ''S&amp;nbsp;602''–''604'' were loaded with ammunition and supplies, and sailed to [[Salonika]], with ''S&amp;nbsp;603'' still under tow, arriving on 18 April 1944.{{sfn|Paterson|2015|pp=220–221}} All four German-operated boats were scuttled or sunk in October 1944 at Salonika as the Germans withdrew from Greece due to [[Red Army]] advances in the Balkans.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=359}}{{sfn|Fraccaroli|1974|pp=176–177}}

=== Post-war service ===
After the end of the war, ''Durmitor'' and ''Kajmakčalan'', along with other JKRM ships and personnel in exile, returned to Šibenik in May 1945.{{sfn|Vujičić|4 May 2014}} They were commissioned in the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] ({{lang-sh-Latn|Jugoslavenska ratna mornarica|links=no}}) as ''TČ&amp;nbsp;5'' and ''TČ&amp;nbsp;6'', later being redesignated as ''TČ&amp;nbsp;391'' and ''TČ&amp;nbsp;392''. Both were stricken in 1963.{{sfn|Gardiner|1995|p=643}}
