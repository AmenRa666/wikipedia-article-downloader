The '''922d Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron''' is a provisional [[United States Air Force]] unit, assigned to [[Air Combat Command]] to activate or inactivate as needed. It was last assigned to the [[474th Air Expeditionary Group]] at [[San Isidro Air Base]], Dominican Republic in 2010.

The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated during [[World War II]] as the '''22d Air Corps Ferrying Squadron''' at [[Morrison Field]], Florida in 1942.  In October 1943 the squadron and its parent group were disbanded and replaced as the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] unit at Morrison by Station 11, Caribbean Wing, Air Transport Command.

The squadron was reconstituted in 1954 as the '''22d Air Transport Squadron''', Medium, a [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] unit, at [[Charleston Air Force Base]], South Carolina. The squadron was inactivated in 1958.

The '''922d Air Refueling Squadron''' operated [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], Ohio from 1959 to 1975, when its parent, the [[17th Bombardment Wing]] moved to [[Beale Air Force Base]], California.

The 922d was reactivated three years later as the '''922d Strategic Squadron''' to control deployed [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) tanker and reconnaissance aircraft operating in the Mediterranean.  In September 1985, the 922d and 22d squadrons were consolidated into a single squadron.  When SAC inactivated in 1992, the squadron became a [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] unit, operating [[Boeing RC-135]]s from [[RAF Mildenhall]] until 1994.

The 922d was converted to provisional status as the '''922d Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron''' and assigned to [[Air Combat Command]] to activate or inactivate as needed.  In 2010 it was activated as part [[Operation Unified Response]]. the military response to the earthquake in Haiti.

==History==

===Airlift operations===
[[File:An USAF C-54 Skymaster.jpg|thumb|left|MATS C-54 Skymaster]]
The squadron was first activated during [[World War II]] as the '''22d Air Corps Ferrying Squadron''' at [[Morrison Field]], Florida in 1942.  The squadron ferried aircraft between Florida and points in western Africa.  From 1943, the unit then focused on the air transportation mission as the '''22d Transport Squadron'''.  Although the squadron was stationed at Morrison, its personnel were also used to man other stations of the Caribbean Wing.  After a little more than a year of trying to use traditional [[Table of organization and equipment|Table of Organization]] units like the 22d, [[Air Transport Command]] (ATC) found them too inflexible for its operations.  It, therefore, decided to replace its groups and squadrons and assign personnel directly to each of its stations, based on the needs of the station.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, in October 1943 the squadron and its parent group were disbanded as ATC combined its units at Morrison into Station 11, Caribbean Wing, Air Transport Command.&lt;ref name=922ERFfacts/&gt;

The squadron was reactivated in March 1954 at [[Charleston Air Force Base]], South Carolina as the '''22d Air Transport Squadron'''&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Mueller, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; with the responsibility of transporting personnel, materiel, mail and other strategic cargo for the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]] and civilian agencies.&lt;ref name=922ERFfacts/&gt;  The squadron was assigned to the [[1608th Air Transport Group]], which had been activated two months earlier.  However, shortages of personnel and equipment delayed the group from reaching operational status upon activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/494/553.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, Initial History 1608 Air Transport Group|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadron operated [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] aircraft until inactivating in March 1958.&lt;ref name=922ERFfacts/&gt;

===Air refueling operations===
[[File:Boeing KC-135 J57 takeoff.JPEG|thumb|Boeing KC-135A on takeoff]]
The '''922d Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated on 1 September 1959 by [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], Ohio&lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;''See'' Mueller, p. 609&lt;/ref&gt; where it was assigned to the [[4043d Strategic Wing]] and equipped with [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s.  The 4043d wing was established by SAC in a program to disperse its [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/056/917.xml|last1=|first1=|title=Abstract (Unclassified), Vol 1, History of Strategic Air Command, Jan–Jun 1957 (Secret)|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SAC bases with large concentrations of bombers made attractive targets.  SAC's response was to break up its wings and scatter their aircraft over a larger number of bases.&lt;ref&gt;Knaack, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron provided [[air refueling]] support to the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] strategic bombers of its parent wing and other USAF units as directed.   Starting in 1960, one third of the squadron's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute [[alert state|alert]], fully fueled and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike.  This was increased to half the squadron's aircraft in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/010/802.xml|last1=|first1=|title=Abstract (Unclassified), History of the Strategic Bomber since 1945 (Top Secret, downgraded to Secret)|date=1 April 1975|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1963 The [[17th Bombardment Wing]] assumed the aircraft, personnel and equipment of the discontinued 4043d wing. The 4043d was a Major Command controlled (MAJCON) wing, which could not carry a permanent history or lineage,&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstein. ''Guide to Air Force Lineage'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and SAC wanted to replace it with a permanent unit.   The 922d was assigned to the newly activated 17th wing.&lt;ref name=Ravenstein17BW&gt;Ravenstein, ''Combat Wings'', pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron deployed aircraft and aircrews to the Western Pacific support combat operations of deployed SAC units and tactical aircraft over [[Indochina]] during the [[Vietnam War]] from 1965 to 1975.   In June 1975, its aircraft were taken off alert and  the squadron phased down, and its aircraft were transferred elsewhere by 7 July.&lt;ref name=Ravenstein17BW/&gt;  The squadron inactivated in September as SAC ended its operations at Wright-Patterson.&lt;ref name=922ERFfacts/&gt;

===Control of deployed forces===
Three years later the squadron was reactivated as the '''922d Strategic Squadron''' at [[Hellenikon Air Base]], near [[Athens]], Greece.  It was assigned to the [[306th Strategic Wing]], which controlled SAC European operations from its station at [[Ramstein Air Base]], Germany.  The squadron provided air refueling and [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] support using aircraft and crews deployed from SAC bases in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstein, pp. 151–153&lt;/ref&gt;  It supported USAFE and [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] [[military exercise|exercises]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/068/452.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 306 Strategic Wing Jul–Sep 1985|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a period of heightened tensions and anti-American activity in Greece, the Greek government notified the United States that American bases in mainland Greece would be closed by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/107/033.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 922 Strategic Squadron Jul–Dec 1988|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the closure of Hellenikon, the squadron moved to [[Souda Bay#Souda Air Base|Souda Bay Naval Air Station]] on the Island of [[Crete]].&lt;ref name=922ERFfacts/&gt;  Two years later, in anticipation of the inactivation of SAC, the squadron moved to [[RAF Mildenhall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/107/027.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, Vol. 1 History 306 Strategic Wing CY 1990|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and managed deployed [[Boeing RC-135]]s from [[RAF Mildenhall]] as the '''922d Reconnaissance Squadron''' until 1994.

In 2007, the squadron was assigned to [[Air Combat Command]] as a provisional unit to activate or inactivate as needed.&lt;ref name=922ERFfacts/&gt;  In 2010, it was activated in the Dominican Republic for [[Operation Unified Response]], responding to the earthquakes in Haiti on the western half of [[Hispaniola]].&lt;ref name=AFOSCR2010&gt;Air Force Organizational Status Change Reports, February and June 2010, Research Division, Air Force Historical Research Agency&lt;/ref&gt;
