==The ship is still in use==
It would appear that the ship [http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2014/04/14/warship-that-fired-first-shots-wwi-now-gravel-barge-in-serbia/ was raised, refurbished, served in the Yugoslav navy from 1952 to 1962 and is currently a gravel barge in Serbia ]. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 01:39, 15 April 2014 (UTC)
:Wow! Good pick-up. Cheers, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 01:50, 15 April 2014 (UTC)

Perhaps the article should be renamed to reflect this new information. It would appear that the ship is still named ''Sava'', but I doubt that the &quot;Yugoslav monitor&quot; prefix is still applied considering its current non-military purpose. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 02:12, 15 April 2014 (UTC)
:I don't think so. Its design and primary purpose was as a river monitor, it served as such for more than half a century with four navies and is the reason it is notable. Its last naval service was with the Yugoslav Navy, so that is in accordance with the current title. Plenty of ex-naval vessels get used as ore carriers, freighters etc after their naval service, but we still refer to them by their naval title. Regards, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 02:21, 15 April 2014 (UTC)

Fair enough. Do you suggest we still begin the article with &quot;The '''Yugoslav monitor ''Sava''''' ''was''...&quot;? It's pretty clear the ship is still in use. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 02:23, 15 April 2014 (UTC)
:Hi, I don't think so. She was a river monitor, she isn't now. If she was refurbished as a monitor (museum piece or whatever), I think described her using &quot;was&quot; would probably then be inappropriate. As it stands, she was a monitor once, not anymore. What do you think? [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 10:19, 15 April 2014 (UTC)

It looks alright, I suppose. Thanks for expanding the lead. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 11:38, 15 April 2014 (UTC)

== 1944 scuttling ==

Just to add some detail: According to page 44 of [http://books.google.hr/books?id=CQtHAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=crew+defected+to+partisans+sava+monitor+brod&amp;dq=crew+defected+to+partisans+sava+monitor+brod&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TXBNU_vFPKe_ygP_7YGwAw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA this source], she was scuttled by her crew near Slavonski Brod and the crew subsequently defected to Yugoslav Partisans. Glad to see good work done on a ship that fired the first shots of the Great War - with the centennial coming up.--[[User:Tomobe03|Tomobe03]] ([[User talk:Tomobe03|talk]]) 17:49, 15 April 2014 (UTC) {{done}} [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 02:29, 16 April 2014 (UTC)

==Photo==
This article is probably in need of a picture to illustrate the topic. Does anyone know if there are any pre-1923 p.d. photos out there? [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 02:27, 16 April 2014 (UTC)
:There's [http://www.kuk-kriegsmarine.it/navi/monitor-fluviali/bodrog/bodrog.html this site] carrying few images where name of the ship &quot;Bodrog&quot; is shown on the hull, or as an inscription on a postcard, with the ship flying Austrian flag - i.e. they must have been taken by 1918. Will that do?--[[User:Tomobe03|Tomobe03]] ([[User talk:Tomobe03|talk]]) 11:40, 16 April 2014 (UTC)
:Alternatively there's [http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205184741 this IWM image], where the caption identifies the ship as Bodrog, but no flag appears to be flown there, and the hull inscription is not visible.--[[User:Tomobe03|Tomobe03]] ([[User talk:Tomobe03|talk]]) 11:50, 16 April 2014 (UTC)
:Finally, Hungarian wiki contains [https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A1jl:Bodrog_monitor_(1904).jpg this image] reportedly of SMS Bodrog in 1904, however the source link there is dead, and there's little to confirm the vessel is indeed Bodrog. Admittedly, it looks like it, but it could be another ship of the class. As a side note, there's an image [http://www.zeljeznice.net/forum/index.php?/topic/9348-stare-razglednice-sa-eljeznikom-tematikom/page-7 on this site] (28.03.2011. - 14:50 entry), where the top image depicts monitor Sava (on the viewer's right, name visible on the bow). The image appears (and is reported) to be a postcard. Now there's a possible way to date it - the inset images appear to me as images of the ruling king. The one in the bottom image (not containing Sava) appears to be [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], while the one in the top might be [[Peter I of Serbia]] (judging by [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PedroIDeSerbia--excitingpersonal00ever.jpg this image of him] - making the postcard presumably pre-1922.--[[User:Tomobe03|Tomobe03]] ([[User talk:Tomobe03|talk]]) 12:06, 16 April 2014 (UTC)
: Great finds! [http://www.kuk-kriegsmarine.it/navi/monitor-fluviali/vari/vari.html thisone] has a postcard painting of the bombardment of Belgrade by the Sava. Do you guys have a preference as to which image we should use? I'll look into the licensing stuff. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 12:16, 16 April 2014 (UTC)

Great! They all look like great photos. We should probably stick to one that clearly identifies the ship as ''Bodrog'', as opposed to one taken from a distance. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 12:36, 16 April 2014 (UTC)

::The IWM image appears to be the best in terms of quality of the photo itself and might be the best candidate for the lead image. I suppose the IWM may be trusted source in terms of trusting its caption, regardless of everything else. Both of the images where she flies Austrian flags (the first site linked in this talk section) appear nice - but the one with the stern and the hull name close up might be a fine addition. Of course the one after the renaming would also be nice, except I find the inset image detracting from its quality (i.e. making it non-lead material). But that's just my 2p.--[[User:Tomobe03|Tomobe03]] ([[User talk:Tomobe03|talk]]) 12:39, 16 April 2014 (UTC)
: Agreed, the IWM photo looks alright for inclusion. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 17:08, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
::{{ping|User:Nikkimaria}} Could you please have a look at [http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205184741 this image] and tell us whether it is possible to use it on WP, and if so on what licensing basis? Thanks, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 23:40, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Speaking of photos, in addition to historical ones, can't someone in Serbia go photograph the present-day ''Sava'' (the gravel barge)? Maybe someone at WP:Serbia could help? [[User:Manxruler|Manxruler]] ([[User talk:Manxruler|talk]]) 23:47, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Most likely, but there's not enough information on that page to verify pre-1923 publication or any author-based licensing tag. Do we have any more information about that photo? [[User:Nikkimaria|Nikkimaria]] ([[User talk:Nikkimaria|talk]]) 23:53, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Plenty more pics [http://www.cityofart.net/bship/sms_donau.html here], but little to tell what their provenance is. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 03:16, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

There's a photo [https://www.history.navy.mil/our-collections/photography/numerical-list-of-images/nhhc-series/nh-series/NH-87000/NH-87548.html here] - the title indicates it's the Romanian monitor ''Bucovina'', but the caption states it's the ex-Austrian ''Sava''. I don't know which one it is, but maybe either of you two can figure it out. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 12:29, 27 July 2016 (UTC)
:Confusingly, the Austro-Hungarian river monitor ''Sava'' was a different vessel from the Yugoslav one of the same name, which was called ''Bodrog'' in Austro-Hungarian service. Cheers, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67|click to talk to me]]) 02:27, 28 July 2016 (UTC)

==Halpern==
Halpern's got plenty to say about the ship's activities in December 1914 and March 1915 on p. 267 of ''A Naval History of World War I''. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 17:55, 25 October 2014 (UTC)
:I've expanded that aspect, let me know what you think? Regards, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|crack... thump]]) 08:24, 26 October 2014 (UTC)</text>
