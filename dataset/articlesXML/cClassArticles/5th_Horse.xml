The '''5th Horse''' is an armoured [[regiment]] of the [[Pakistan Army]]. It was previously known as the '''5th King Edward's Own Probyn's Horse''', which was a regular cavalry regiment of the [[British Indian Army]]. It was formed in 1921 by the amalgamation of the '''11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse)''' and the '''12th Cavalry'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaylor 1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaylor|first=John|title=Sons of John Company: The Indian and Pakistan Armies 1903–91|publisher=Stroud: Spellmount|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|11}}11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse)==
The regiment known as 11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse) was originally raised on 1 August 1857 by Captain Frederick Wale as Wale's Horse during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and served at [[Lucknow]]. Captain Wale was killed in action on 1 March 1858, while leading the regiment in the pursuit of rebels, and was replaced by Major [[Dighton Probyn]], VC. In 1860 the regiment was dispatched to [[China]] to take part in the [[Second Opium War]]. It participated in the advance on [[Peking]] and returned to India in 1861 with a good reputation. The regiment saw service in the [[Second Afghan War]] of 1878-80 and then took part in the Black Mountains Expedition; it went to Chitral and formed part of the [[Malakand Field Force]]. During the [[First World War]], the regiment served in [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaylor 1991&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyle 1929&quot;&gt;Boyle, Maj CA. (1929).

=={{anchor|12}}12th Cavalry==
The 12th Cavalry was also raised during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], by Captain PR Hockin in October 1857. The cavalry committed a [[war crime]] by massacring &quot;hundreds&quot; people at [[Mahua Dabar]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081208/jsp/atleisure/story_10221665.jsp Found: Raj-razed town]&lt;/ref&gt; It formed part of the [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia]] ([[Ethiopia]]) and served in the [[Second Afghan War]] of 1878-80. During the First World War, the regiment fought in the [[Mesopotamian Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaylor 1991&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyle 1929&quot;/&gt;

==Probyn's Horse (5th King Edward VII's Own Lancers)==
After the First World War, the number of Indian cavalry regiments was reduced from thirty-nine to twenty-one. However, instead of disbanding the surplus units, it was decided to amalgamate them in pairs. This resulted in renumbering and renaming the entire cavalry line. The 11th King Edward’s Own Lancers (Probyn’s Horse) and the 12th Cavalry were amalgamated at Meerut on 28 August 1921 to form 5th King Edward's Own Probyn's Horse. The uniform of Probyn's Horse was blue with scarlet facings. The new regiment's badge consisted of the [[Prince of Wales]]'s plumes. Its class composition was one squadron each of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]i Muslims, [[Sikh]]s and [[Dogra]]s. The regiment was mechanised in 1940. During the [[Second World War]], the regiment served with great distinction in [[Burma]]. On the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, Probyn's Horse was allotted to Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaylor 1991&quot;/&gt; In 1956, Pakistan became a republic and all titles pertaining to British royalty were dropped. The regiment's new designation was '''5 Horse''', although informally, it continues to be known as the '''Probyn's Horse'''. During the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], 5 Horse fought in the Battle of Khem Karan.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sabre &amp; Lance: Journal of the Pakistan Armoured Corps''. (1997).
