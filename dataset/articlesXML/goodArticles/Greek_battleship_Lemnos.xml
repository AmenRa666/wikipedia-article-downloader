'''''Lemnos''''', sometimes spelled '''''Limnos''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: '''''Θ/Κ Λήμνος'''''), was a 13,000 ton {{sclass-|Mississippi|battleship}} originally built by the [[United States Navy]] in 1904&amp;ndash;1908. As {{USS|Idaho|BB-24|2}}, she was purchased by the [[Hellenic Navy|Greek Navy]] in 1914 and renamed ''Lemnos'', along with her sister {{USS|Mississippi|BB-23|2}}, renamed [[Greek battleship Kilkis|''Kilkis'']]. ''Lemnos'' was named for the [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Battle of Lemnos]], a crucial engagement of the [[First Balkan War]]. Armed with a main battery of four {{convert|12|in|abbr=on|0}} guns, ''Lemnos'' and her sister were the most powerful vessels in the Greek fleet.

The ship saw limited action during [[World War I]]. Greece's pro-German monarch, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] opted to remain neutral until October 1916, when pressure from the [[Triple Entente]] forced him to abdicate in favor of a pro-Entente government. For the remainder of the war, ''Lemnos'' operated solely as a harbor defense ship. In the aftermath of World War I, she saw service during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1919&amp;ndash;1922. During the war with Turkey, ''Lemnos'' supported Greek landings in Turkey and participated in the final Greek sea-borne withdrawal in 1922. She remained in service until 1932, when she was used as a [[barracks ship]] and subsequently disarmed. During the German invasion of Greece in 1941, she and her sister were sunk in [[Salamis Naval Base|Salamis]] by German [[Junkers Ju 87]] dive bombers. The two ships were ultimately raised and broken up for scrap after the end of the war.

==Design==
{{main|Mississippi-class battleship}}
''Lemnos'' was {{convert|382|ft|m}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|77|ft|abbr=on}} and a [[Draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{convert|24|ft|8|in|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|13000|MT|sp=us}} as designed and up to {{convert|14465|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. The ship was powered by two-shaft vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s and eight coal-fired [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] [[boiler]]s rated at {{convert|10000|ihp|lk=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|17|kn|mph km/h|lk=in}}. [[Lattice mast]]s were installed in 1909. She had a crew of 744 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=G144/&gt;

The ship was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|12|in|abbr=on|0}} L/45 guns in two twin turrets, one on either end of the [[superstructure]]. Eight {{convert|8|in|abbr=on|0}} L/45 guns were mounted in four twin turrets, two on other side of the vessel [[amidships]]. The secondary battery was rounded out with eight {{convert|7|in|abbr=on|0}} L/45 guns mounted individually in [[casemate]]s along the length of the hull. Close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s was protected by a battery of twelve {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} L/50 guns, six 3-pounder guns and two 1-pounder guns. The ship's armament system was completed by two {{convert|21|in|abbr=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in her hull.&lt;ref name=G144/&gt; ''Lemnos'' and ''Kilkis'' were the most powerful vessels in the Greek Navy.&lt;ref name=PH80&gt;Paloczi-Horvath, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
Laid down on 12 May 1904, the ship was launched on 9 December 1905 and commissioned into the [[United States Navy]] on 1 April 1908 as {{USS|Idaho|BB-24|6}}.&lt;ref name=G144&gt;Gardiner, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Greece became engaged in a naval [[arms race]] with the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the time; the Ottomans had purchased a pair of German pre-dreadnoughts&amp;mdash;{{SMS|Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm||2}} and {{SMS|Weissenburg||2}} in 1910&amp;mdash;and ordered [[dreadnought battleship]]s from Britain in 1911 and 1914. The Greek Navy ordered the dreadnought {{ship|Greek battleship|Salamis||2}} from Germany in 1913 and the dreadnought {{ship|Greek battleship|Basileus Konstantinos||2}} from France. As a stop-gap measure, the Greeks purchased ''Mississippi'' and ''Idaho'' from the US Navy,&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, pp. 24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; for the sum of $12,535,276.58,&lt;ref&gt;Cassimatis, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; on 30 June 1914.&lt;ref name=GG384&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; The two ships were transferred to the Greek Navy in [[Newport News, Virginia]] the following month, ''Idaho'' and ''Mississippi'' becoming ''Lemnos'' and ''Kilkis'', respectively.&lt;ref name=Hore&gt;Hore, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lemnos'' and ''Kilkis'' quickly left the United States after their transfer in July 1914, due to the rising tensions in Europe following the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;Parramore et al., p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of World War I in at the end of the month, Greece's pro-German monarch, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], decided to remain neutral. The [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers landed troops in [[Salonika]] in 1915, which was a source of tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October 1916 (see ''[[Noemvriana]]'' and [[National Schism]]).&lt;ref name=GG383&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lemnos'' was reduced to a skeleton crew and had the breech blocks for her guns removed to render them inoperable. All ammunition and torpedoes were also removed.&lt;ref&gt;Fotakis, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, a pro-Entente government under Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] replaced Constantine and declared war on the Central Powers. ''Lemnos'', however, did not see active service with Greece's new allies,&lt;ref name=GG383/&gt; and instead was used solely for harbor defense until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=PH80/&gt;

After the end of World War I, ''Lemnos'' joined the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] and served with the Crimean Expedition. There, she aided the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the Communists.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite web|title=Idaho|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/i1/idaho-ii.htm|publisher=[[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]]|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then saw service during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], where she supported landings to seize Ottoman territory. The Ottoman Navy had been interned by the Allies after the end of World War I, and so provided no opposition to the Greek Navy's activities.&lt;ref name=GG383/&gt; During this period, she also operated in the [[Black Sea]] to support the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]]. In April 1919, ''Lemnos'' was present in [[Feodosia|Kaffa]] Bay, where she provided [[naval gunfire support|gunfire support]] to the [[Volunteer Army]]. On 22 April, aerial reconnaissance reported that the [[Red Army]] was massing in the town of [[Vladislovovka]]; ''Lemnos'' and the British [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Caradoc|D60|6}} bombarded the town, forcing the Soviet forces to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 39&amp;ndash;40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Idaho sunk with USS Mississippi in background.jpg|thumb|''Kilkis'' and ''Lemnos'' sunk after German air attack, 1941.]]

In February 1921, ''Lemnos'' was stationed in [[Smyrna]] to support the occupation of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; Operations came to a close in September 1922 when the Greek Army was forced to evacuate Smyrna by sea, along with a sizable number of civilians from Asia Minor. The fleet transported a total of 250,000 soldiers and civilians during the evacuation.&lt;ref name=GG383/&gt; ''Lemnos'' departed Smyrna on the evening of 8 September with her sister ''Kilkis''.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; While en route from Smyrna to mainland Greece, Captain [[Dimitrios Fokas]], the commander of ''Lemnos'', formed a Revolutionary Committee with [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] and [[Stylianos Gonatas]], two [[colonel]]s who supported Venizelos, who had been ousted in 1920. The men launched the [[11 September 1922 Revolution]], and other vessels in the fleet mutinied in support of the coup. King [[Constantine I of Greece]] was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, [[George II of Greece|George II]].&lt;ref&gt;Llewellyn Smith, pp. 312&amp;ndash;315&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, ''Lemnos'' was placed in inactive reserve; sections of her armor plate was removed to build fortifications on the island of [[Aegina]].&lt;ref name=GG384/&gt; She was disarmed in 1937 and thereafter used as a barracks ship.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Chesneau, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 1940, Italy invaded Greece, initiating the [[Greco-Italian War]] as part of the Italian dictactor [[Benito Mussolini]]'s expansionist program. The Greek army quickly defeated the Italians and pushed them back to [[Albania]]. Less than two weeks later, the Italian fleet was badly damaged in the British [[Raid on Taranto]], which significantly reduced the threat the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' posed to the Greek fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiades, pp. 19&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lemnos'' remained out of service, but spare guns from she and ''Kilkis'' were employed as coastal batteries throughout Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann &amp; Jurga, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 1941, the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' [[Battle of Greece|invaded Greece]] to support its Italian ally in the stalemated conflict. The hulk of ''Lemnos'' was bombed in [[Salamis Naval Base]] by [[Junkers Ju 87]] [[dive bomber]]s on 23 April.&lt;ref name=GG384/&gt; The ship was beached to prevent her from sinking; her wreck was broken up after the end of the war.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;
