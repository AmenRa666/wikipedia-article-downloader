'''HNLMS ''Abraham Crijnssen''''' was a {{sclass-|Jan van Amstel|minesweeper||ship}} of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] (RNN). Built during the 1930s, she was based in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] when Japan attacked at the end of 1941. Ordered to retreat to Australia, the ship was disguised as a tropical island to avoid detection, and was the last Dutch ship to escape from the region. On arriving in Australia in 1942, she was commissioned into the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) as '''HMAS ''Abraham Crijnssen''''' and operated as an anti-submarine escort. Although returned to RNN control in 1943, the ship remained in Australian waters for most of [[World War II]]. After the war, ''Abraham Crijnssen'' operated on anti-[[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]] patrols in the East Indies, before returning to the Netherlands and being converted into a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom defence]] ship in 1956. Removed from service in 1960, the vessel was donated to the [[Sea Cadet Corps The Netherlands (Zeekadetkorps Nederland)|Netherlands Sea Cadet Corps]] for training purposes. In 1995, ''Abraham Crijnssen'' was acquired by the [[Dutch Navy Museum]] for preservation as a [[museum ship]].

==Design and construction==
''Abraham Crijnssen'' was the third{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} of eight {{sclass-|Jan van Amstel|minesweeper||ship}}s constructed for the RNN during the late 1930s.&lt;ref name=Bastock221&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; Built by [[Werf Gusto]] at their yard in [[Schiedam]], South Holland, the minesweeper was launched on 22 September 1936, and commissioned into the RNN on 26 May 1937.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; She was named after 17th century naval commander [[Abraham Crijnssen]].

''Abraham Crijnssen'' and her [[sister ship]]s were {{convert|184|ft}} long, with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|25|ft}}, a [[draught (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|7|ft}}, and a [[displacement (nautical)|displacement]] of 525 tons.&lt;ref name=Bastock221/&gt; The minesweepers were fitted with two Yarrow 3-drum boilers and two [[Stork B.V.|Stork]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} [[triple expansion engine]]s, which provided {{convert|1690|ihp|0|abbr=on}} to two propeller shafts, allowing the ship to reach {{convert|15|kn}}.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; ''Abraham Crijnssen'' was armed with a single 3-inch gun, and two [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]], plus a payload of [[depth charge]]s.&lt;ref name=Bastock221/&gt;&lt;ref name=RAN&gt;''HMAS Abraham Crijnssen'', Royal Australian Navy&lt;/ref&gt; The standard ship's company was 45.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:HNLMS Abraham Crijnssen Covered In Branches.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up of the foliage used to camouflage the superstructure of the ship]]

===Early service===
The ship was based at [[Surabaya]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] when Japan invaded in 1941.&lt;ref name=Bastock222&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;''The Abraham Crijnssen'', Australian War Memorial&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] defeats at the Battles of the [[Battle of the Java Sea|Java Sea]] and [[Battle of Sunda Strait|Sunda Strait]] in late March 1942, all Allied ships were ordered to withdraw to Australia.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; ''Abraham Crijnssen'' was meant to sail with three other warships, but found herself proceeding alone.&lt;ref name=Liem&gt;Liem, ''That time a Dutch warship pretended to be an island to evade the enemy''&lt;/ref&gt;

To escape detection by Japanese aircraft (which the minesweeper did not have the armament to defend effectively against), the ship was heavily camouflaged with jungle foliage, giving the impression of a small island.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Liem/&gt; Personnel cut down trees and branches from nearby islands, and arranged the cuttings to form a jungle canopy covering as much of the ship as possible.&lt;ref name=Liem/&gt; Any hull still exposed was painted to resemble rocks and cliffs.&lt;ref name=Liem/&gt; To further the illusion, the ship would remain close to shore, anchored and immobile during daylight, and only sail at night.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Liem/&gt; She headed for [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], where she arrived on 20 March 1942; ''Abraham Crijnssen'' was the last vessel to successfully escape Java, and the only ship of her class in the region to survive.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bastock222/&gt;

===RAN service===
After arriving in Australian waters, the minesweeper underwent a refit, which included the installation of new [[ASDIC]] equipment.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; On 28 September, the minesweeper was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS ''Abraham Crijnssen''.&lt;ref name=Bastock222/&gt; She was reclassified as an anti-submarine convoy escort, and was also used as a [[submarine tender]] for the Dutch submarines that relocated to Australia following the Japanese conquest.&lt;ref name=Bastock222/&gt; The ship's Dutch sailors were supplemented with survivors from the British [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Jupiter|F85|6}} and Australian personnel, all under the command of an Australian lieutenant.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; The [[wardroom]] tradition of hanging a portrait of the commissioned ship's reigning monarch led to some tension before it was decided to leave Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] on the bulkhead instead of replacing her with King [[George VI of the United Kingdom]], which was installed in the lieutenant's cabin.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;

While escorting a convoy to Sydney through Bass Strait on 26 January 1943, ''Abraham Crijnssen'' detected a submarine on [[ASDIC]].&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; The convoy was ordered to scatter, while ''Abraham Crijnssen'' and {{HMAS|Bundaberg|J231|6}} depth charged the submarine contact.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; No wreckage of the suspected submarine was found.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; A pair of hastily released depth charges at the start of the engagement damaged the minesweeper; several fittings and pipes were damaged, and all of her centreline rivets had to be replaced during a week-long dry-docking.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;
[[File:HRMS Abraham Crijnssen disguised as a tropical island.jpg|thumb|left|''Abraham Crijnssen'', in disguise as a jungle island]]

===Return to RNN===
''Abraham Crijnssen'' was returned to RNN service on 5 May 1943, but remained in Australian waters for most of World War II.&lt;ref name=Bastock222/&gt; On 7 June 1945, the minesweeper left Sydney for Darwin, with the [[Lighter (barge)|oil lighter]] (and former submarine) [[HMAS K9|''K9'']] in tow.&lt;ref name=Bastock222/&gt; On 8 June, the tow cable snapped, and ''K9'' washed ashore at [[Seal Rocks, New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=Bastock222/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carrunters151&gt;Carrunters, ''Japanese Submarine Raiders 1942'', p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

''Abraham Crijnssen'' was used for [[Demining|mine-clearing sweeps]] of [[Kupang]] Harbour prior to the arrival of a RAN force to accept the Japanese surrender of Timor.&lt;ref name=Bastock222/&gt;

===Post-war===
Following the end of World War II, the minesweeper was used on anti-[[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]] patrols of the [[Netherlands East Indies]].&lt;ref name=Bastock222/&gt; She left for the Netherlands in August 1951, and was converted into a boom defence vessel in March 1956.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;

==Decommissioning and preservation==
[[File:HNLMS Abraham Crijnssen Oct 2011.jpg|thumb|''Abraham Crijnssen'' at the Dutch Navy Museum in Den Helder in 2011]]
The ship was removed from the Navy List in 1960.&lt;ref name=Bastock222/&gt; After leaving service, ''Abraham Crijnssen'' was donated to the [[Sea Cadet Corps The Netherlands (Zeekadetkorps Nederland)|Sea Cadet Corps (''Zeekadetkorps Nederland'')]] for training purposes.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; She was docked at The Hague from 1962 to 1972, after which she was moved to Rotterdam.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; The ship was also used as a storage [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] during this time.&lt;ref name=Bastock222/&gt;

In 1995, ''Abraham Crijnssen'' was marked for preservation by the [[Dutch Navy Museum]] at [[Den Helder]].&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; She was retrofitted to her wartime configuration.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt;
