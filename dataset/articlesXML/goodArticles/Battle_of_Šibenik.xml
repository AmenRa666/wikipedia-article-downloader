{{Campaignbox Croatian War of Independence}}
The '''Battle of Šibenik''' ({{lang-hr|Bitka za Šibenik}}), also known as the '''September War''' (''Rujanski rat''), was an armed conflict fought between the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' – JNA), supported by the [[Croatian Serb]]-established [[Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina]] (SAO Krajina), and the [[Croatian National Guard]] (''Zbor Narodne Garde'' – ZNG), supported by the [[Croatian Police]]. The battle was fought to the north and west of the city of [[Šibenik]], [[Croatia]] on 16&amp;ndash;22 September 1991, during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. The JNA's initial orders were to relieve Croatian [[Battle of the Barracks|siege of their barracks]] in the city and isolate the region of [[Dalmatia]] from the rest of Croatia. The JNA's advance was supported by the [[Yugoslav Air Force]] and the [[Yugoslav Navy]].

Fighting stopped following a Croatian counter-attack that pushed the JNA back from the outskirts of Šibenik. Although some ground was lost to the Yugoslavs, especially around the town of [[Drniš]], northeast of Šibenik, the ZNG captured several JNA and Yugoslav Navy facilities in the city, including dozens of navy vessels and several [[coastal artillery]] batteries. The captured batteries were used to support defence of the city. The JNA Šibenik garrison was evacuated following an agreement between the Croatian officials and the JNA, except for several comparably small JNA posts in the city which were captured by the ZNG.

The September&amp;ndash;October fighting caused three Croatian military and seven civilian deaths, as well as more than a hundred wounded. JNA bombarded Šibenik, causing damage to numerous structures, including the [[Šibenik Cathedral|Cathedral of St. James]], a [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Croatia|World Heritage Site]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' judged the bombardment to be a part of  calculated assaults on the heritage of Croatia. Artillery bombardment of the city continued over the following 100 days. The battle is commemorated in Šibenik each year.

==Background==
In 1990, following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|electoral defeat]] of the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], ethnic tensions worsened. The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' – JNA) confiscated Croatia's [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]] weapons to minimize resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August, tensions escalated into an [[Log Revolution|open revolt]] of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]],&lt;ref name=Hoare118&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around Knin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|19 August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] and [[eastern Croatia]], largely fueled by recollections of the Serbs of the genocide to which they had been subjected in the [[Independent State of Croatia]] during [[World War II]], and their resultant unwillingness to be minorities in an independent Croatia.&lt;ref name=MarticICTY&gt;{{harvnb|ICTY|12 June 2007|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two unsuccessful attempts by [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Serbia]], supported by [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Serbia's provinces of [[Vojvodina]] and [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo]], to obtain the [[Yugoslav Presidency]]'s approval of a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pakrac clash|a bloodless skirmish]] between Serb insurgents and [[Lučko Anti-Terrorist Unit|Croatian special police]] in March,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|pp=384–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to give it wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came under control of Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Milošević, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than preservation of Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia.&lt;ref name=Hoare119&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated to [[Plitvice Lakes incident|the first fatalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JNA stepped in, supporting the insurgents, and preventing [[Law enforcement in Croatia|Croatian police]] from intervening.&lt;ref name=Hoare119/&gt; In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention of integration of the area under their control, viewed by the [[Government of Croatia]] as a breakaway region with Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|2 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, Croatia doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was [[Croatian special police order of battle in 1991–95|3,000 special police]], deployed in twelve battalions adopting military unit organization. In addition, there were 9,000&amp;ndash;10,000 regionally organized reserve police. The reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but the reserve force lacked weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the [[Croatian National Guard]] (''Zbor narodne garde''),&lt;ref name=EECIS272&gt;{{harvnb|EECIS|1999|pp=272–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its development was hampered by a [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 713|arms embargo]] introduced in September 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Independent|10 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
By late June and throughout July, northern Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but no actual combat. Nonetheless, the increasing intensity of the conflict in the region and elsewhere in Croatia led to the preparation of [[bomb shelter]]s in Zadar by city officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ružić|2011|p=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina]] (SAO Krajina) authorities [[Mobilization|called up]] three Territorial Defence units in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July, one day after another fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area,&lt;ref name=Ruzic418&gt;{{harvnb|Ružić|2011|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps conscripted the local Serb population in Benkovac to strengthen its ranks by the end of the month.&lt;ref name=Ruzic420&gt;{{harvnb|Ružić|2011|p=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late July, a paramilitary group, led by [[Miro Barešić]] and formally subordinated to the [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of Defence]], conducted several sabotages in the Benkovac area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ružić|2011|pp=420–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August, Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG [[4th Guards Brigade (Croatia)|4th Guards Brigade]] to [[Kruševo, Croatia|Kruševo]] near [[Obrovac, Croatia|Obrovac]]. Two days later they engaged in combat against the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence and police forces, marking the first such engagement of the [[Croatian War of Independence]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ružić|2011|p=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August, the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps openly sided with the SAO Krajina forces as they jointly [[1991 siege of Kijevo|attacked Kijevo]], expelling all Croats from the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silber|Little|1996|pp=171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another significant setback for Croatia in the region was JNA capture of the [[Maslenica Bridge (D8)|Maslenica Bridge]] on 11 September. That severed the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11&amp;ndash;13 September, an attack in the area of [[Skradin]] cut water and power supply to Šibenik.&lt;ref name=HV297&gt;{{harvnb|Hrvatski vojnik|June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September, the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut [[utilities]] to all JNA facilities located in Croatian-controlled territory, beginning the [[Battle of the Barracks]].&lt;ref name=BB95&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move blockaded 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous smaller facilities, including border posts, weapons and ammunition storage depots.&lt;ref name=BB95/&gt; The blockade forced the JNA to amend its planned [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia|campaign in Croatia]] to accommodate the new development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, a [[coastal artillery]] battery on the [[Žirje, Croatia|Žirje Island]] was captured by Croatian forces,&lt;ref name=HV77&gt;{{harvnb|Hrvatski vojnik|November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; after JNA [[Yugoslav People's Army Ranks|Senior Sergeant]] Željko Baltić, battery commanding officer, switched his allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|26 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battery consisted of twelve [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.|Ansaldo]] [[Cannone da 90/53|90/53 guns]] which were once armament of the [[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|Italian battleship ''Vittorio Veneto'']].&lt;ref name=HV297/&gt;

The JNA's planned campaign included an advance in the Šibenik area by the 9th (Knin) Corps, which was tasked with isolating Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia. As it was fully mobilised and prepared for deployment, the corps began operations against the ZNG on 16 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main axis of attack was directed at [[Vodice, Croatia|Vodice]], with supporting advances towards Zadar, [[Drniš]] and [[Sinj]]. The push was designed to create favourable circumstances to attack Zadar, [[Šibenik]] and Split.&lt;ref name=Brigovic428&gt;{{harvnb|Brigović|2011|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; With support from a corps-level battalion of [[M-84]] tanks and the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence, the JNA 221st Mechanised Brigade (without its battalion of [[T-34]] tanks), was committed to the main axis of the attack. The secondary advance, towards [[Biograd na Moru]] on the right flank, was assigned to the 180th Mechanised Brigade, supported by the armoured battalion removed from the 221st Brigade, the 557th Mixed Antitank Artillery Regiment and the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence. Offensive support was provided by the 9th Mixed Artillery Regiment and the 9th Military Police Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hrvatski vojnik|September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 221st Brigade was commanded by [[Colonel]] Borislav Đukić.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements the 46th Partisan Division,&lt;ref name=HV314/&gt; drawn from the 24th ([[Kragujevac]]) Corps, also provuded support for the corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marijan|2012|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JNA garrison in Šibenik barracks included the 11th Marine Infantry Brigade&amp;mdash;one of a handful of units regularly maintained at full [[combat readiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marijan|2003|loc=note 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the JNA, the ZNG 113th Infantry Brigade, commanded by [[Milivoj Petković]], defended the city of Šibenik together with police forces, under overall control of the Šibenik crisis centre headed by [[Josip Juras]].&lt;ref name=SD180910/&gt; The 4th Battalion of the 113th Infantry Brigade, commanded by Josip Jukica,&lt;ref name=SD180910/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucic76/&gt; as well as the 4th Battalion of the [[4th Guards Brigade (Croatia)|4th Guards Brigade]], commanded by Ivan Zelić,&lt;ref name=RD200911&gt;{{harvnb|Radio Drniš|20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; defended the Drniš area, {{convert|25|km|abbr=off}} northeast of Šibenik, supported by a company of police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucić|2013|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 600-strong 4th Battalion of the 4th Guards Brigade represented the strongest ZNG unit in the area, while the JNA is estimated by Croatian sources to have deployed approximately 1,500 troops against Drniš.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucić|2013|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September, all Croatian combat troops in Drniš area were subordinated to Luka Vujić.&lt;ref name=RD200911/&gt; The western bank of the [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka River]] and approaches to Vodice were controlled by the 3rd Battalion of the 113th Infantry Brigade. While [[small arms]] were sufficient to arm a part of the battalion at a time, the battalion did not have any heavy weapons.&lt;ref name=SD150901&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|15 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
[[File:Map 6 - Croatia - Knin-Zadar-North Dalmatia Operation - January 1992.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Situation in the northern Dalmatia, January 1992]]
The offensive commenced at 16:00 on 16 September.&lt;ref name=HV312&gt;{{harvnb|Hrvatski vojnik|October 2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the left flank, the JNA advanced towards Drniš, capturing the villages of [[Maljkovo]] and [[Kričke, Šibenik-Knin County|Kričke]], and interdicting the [[D56 road (Croatia)|Drniš&amp;ndash;Split]], east of the Krka River. On the opposite river bank, the JNA advanced towards Vodice and Šibenik, threatening the city from the west,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hrvatski vojnik|October 2010b}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching the western side of the {{convert|390|m|adj=on}} Šibenik Bridge on the [[Adriatic Highway]]. The advance was so rapid it cut off the 1st Company of the 3rd Battalion of the ZNG 113th Infantry Brigade from the rest of the ZNG force.&lt;ref name=SD180910&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Večernji list|3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day, the ZNG captured a {{convert|100|mm|adj=on}} coastal artillery battery near village of [[Zečevo]].&lt;ref name=HV77/&gt; By 17 September, the commanding officer of the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps, [[Major General]] Vladimir Vuković, modified the initial deployment plan, because of strong resistance offered by the ZNG and the Croatian police, relying on populated areas and terrain features to hold back the JNA forces north of Vodice. The changes involved diverting a part of the force to attack Drniš and Sinj directly, while the remainder of the attacking force rested.&lt;ref name=HV312/&gt; The [[Yugoslav Navy]] started a [[blockade]] of Šibenik and the entire Croatian [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast.&lt;ref name=Brigovic428/&gt;

On the night of 17/18 September, the JNA was ordered to trap and destroy the ZNG force in Drniš and the [[Miljevci|Miljevci Plateau]] area, while holding positions achieved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=HV312/&gt; In the morning, the JNA resumed its offensive towards Vodice, on the right flank of the attack,&lt;ref name=HV314&gt;{{harvnb|Hrvatski vojnik|October 2010c}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ZNG abandoned Drniš and pulled back to village of [[Unešić]].&lt;ref name=Lucic76&gt;{{harvnb|Lucić|2013|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September, the ZNG captured a {{convert|88|mm|adj=on}} JNA coastal artillery battery on the Smokvica Island and the &quot;Krušćica&quot; barracks near [[Rogoznica]].&lt;ref name=HV77/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brigović|2011|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weapons retrieved from the captured barracks, a shipment received from [[Gospić]] following [[Battle of Gospić|capture of JNA facilities in the town]],&lt;ref name=SD150901/&gt; as well as use of the captured artillery pieces, significantly improved ZNG's capabilities.&lt;ref name=SD140910&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JNA advance south from Drniš was effectively halted that day, following three successful ambush attacks by the ZNG in Unešić, Pakovo Selo and south of Žitnić.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucić|2013|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JNA orders were changed again on 20 September, when the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps orders were supplanted by the Military-Maritime District order, issued by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Mile Kandić]], for the corps to reorient the JNA force north of Vodice towards Šibenik and Split. This required crossing the Šibenik Bridge spanning the Krka River [[ria]].&lt;ref name=HV314/&gt; The eastward advance{{mdash}}with [[close air support]] from the [[Yugoslav Air Force]]{{mdash}}failed, and cost the air force four aircraft shot down by the ZNG.&lt;ref name=Index&gt;{{harvnb|Index.hr|21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September, a Croatian counter-attack, supported by recently acquired artillery, pushed back the JNA from the bridge by 10:00,&lt;ref name=SD150901/&gt; extending the ZNG-controlled bridgehead to the area of Gaćelezi, {{convert|9|km|abbr=off}} to the northwest.&lt;ref name=Sibenik2209/&gt; Four guns of the Žirje battery were used as [[anti-tank guns]] in support of the counter-attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September, the Croatian forces captured the JNA &quot;Kuline&quot; barracks in Šibenik itself along with the 15 Yugoslav Navy vessels based there. In addition, 19 vessels undergoing various stages of overhaul were captured in the &quot;Velimir Škorpik&quot; shipyard. The ships, comprising approximately a quarter of the Yugoslav Naval assets, included: ''Vlado Ćetković'' (RTOP-402) [[Končar-class fast attack craft|''Končar''-class fast attack craft]] (renamed {{ship|Croatian missile boat|Šibenik|RTOP-21|3}} later on), ''Velimir Škorpik'' (RČ-310) [[Osa-class missile boat|''Osa''-class missile boat]], ''Partizan II'' (TČ-222) [[Shershen-class torpedo boat|''Shershen''-class torpedo boat]] and ''Biokovo'' (PČ-171), ''Cer'' (PČ-180) and ''Durmitor'' (PČ-181) ''Mirna''-class [[patrol boat]]s.&lt;ref name=HV77/&gt;

On 23 September, the JNA fully secured Drniš and its surroundings. At the same time, it shifted its focus to the [[Battle of Zadar]], away from Šibenik. The Yugoslav naval blockade was lifted unilaterally the same day.&lt;ref name=Brigovic428/&gt; Even though a number of JNA facilities in the city were captured by the ZNG, several major JNA posts remained in Šibenik. Those included &quot;Rade Končar&quot; barracks housing the 11th Marine Infantry Brigade, &quot;Ante Jonić&quot; barracks, &quot;Minerska&quot; depot where [[naval mine]]s were stored, &quot;Jamnjak&quot; depot and the &quot;Ražine&quot; artillery battery containing confiscated Croatian Territorial Defence weapons and &quot;Duboka&quot; fuel storage.&lt;ref name=Brigovic440&gt;{{harvnb|Brigović|2011|p=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Duboka&quot; depot consisted of three {{convert|1410000|l|adj=on}} [[storage tank]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brigović|2011|p=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:St. Jacobuskathedraal ; Sibenik.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Šibenik Cathedral|Cathedral of St. James]] in Šibenik sustained artillery damage in September 1991]]
The JNA was defeated in the battle, subsequently nicknamed the &quot;September War&quot; (''Rujanski rat'').&lt;ref name=Brigovic428/&gt; Its total losses in the battle were not reported. The ZNG and the Croatian police sustained losses of three killed and 49 wounded troops in the battle. At the same time seven civilians were killed and 64 wounded.&lt;ref name=Sibenik2209&gt;{{harvnb|Šibenik|22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; JNA artillery continued intermittent bombardment of Šibenik over the following 100 days resulting in further casualties and damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mojzes|2011|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damaged structures included the [[Šibenik Cathedral|Cathedral of St. James]], a [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Croatia|World Heritage Site]]. An editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' labeled bombardment of the cathedral as a part of the &quot;calculated assaults&quot; on treasures of Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|22 September 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fighting, [[electrical substation]]s in [[Bilice, Šibenik-Knin County|Bilice]] and Konjsko were destroyed, disrupting [[electric power distribution]] in Dalmatia.{{sfn|Gow|2003|pp=156-157}}

Evacuation of the JNA facilities and surrender of the confiscated Territorial Defence weapons stored in the Šibenik&amp;ndash;Split area was agreed on 21 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brigović|2011|pp=438–439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the process, tensions remained high, and the JNA made contingency plans to break through from Knin to Šibenik and Split to relieve the siege of its forces there&amp;mdash;[[codename]]d Operation Coast-91 (''Operacija Obala-91'') and Operation Hurricane-91 (''Operacija Orkan-91'') respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brigović|2011|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the JNA facilities in Šibenik, along with the confiscated Territorial Defence weapons, were handed over to the Croatian authorities by 10 December.&lt;ref name=Brigovic440/&gt;

News coverage of the battle produced television footage of ZNG air defence artillery at Zečevo firing at a Yugoslav Air Force [[Soko J-21 Jastreb]] and scoring a hit on another J-21 using a guided missile. The footage, ending in shouts claiming that both of the planes were downed, became one of the most significant pieces of material in terms of propaganda and morale in Croatia. Nonetheless, the footage proved controversial, since the first plane is not shown falling to the ground or into the sea, but diving towards the horizon after giving away a puff of smoke &amp;mdash; variously interpreted as smoke caused by the plane's cannon fire or anti-aircraft fire damage. While the first J-21 downing remains unconfirmed, the second J-21, piloted by [[Croat]] Valter Juršić of the 240th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron, was shot down by Neven Livajić using a [[9K38 Igla]] and wreckage of the plane was retrieved.&lt;ref name=Index/&gt;

Another controversy which arose in the aftermath of the battle pertains to the Žirje Island coastal artillery battery. Extent of the role played by the battery was disputed between [[Brigadier General]] [[Rahim Ademi]], who claimed the bridge was beyond range of the guns,&lt;ref name=SD140910/&gt; and thirteen ZNG and police officers, who held various posts in Šibenik at the time, who claimed Ademi was wrong in his assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Večernji list|15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the guns were removed from Žirje. {{As of|2010}} two were refurbished in preparation for return to Žirje, as museum exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle is commemorated annually in Šibenik each September. There are two [[documentary film]]s covering Šibenik and its surroundings during the battle: ''My city will be happy too'' (''I moj će grad biti sretan'') by Matea Šarić and ''September War 1991, Šibenik&amp;ndash;Vodice'' (''Rujanski rat 1991. Šibenik&amp;ndash;Vodice'') by Šime Strikoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jutarnji list|15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
