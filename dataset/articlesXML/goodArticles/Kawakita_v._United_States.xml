'''''Kawakita v. United States''''', {{Ussc|343|717|1952|el=no}},{{ref|citation}} is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court ruled that a [[United States nationality law#Dual citizenship|dual U.S./Japanese citizen]] could be convicted of [[treason#United States|treason]] against the United States for acts performed in [[Japan]] during [[World War II]].  Tomoya Kawakita, born in California to Japanese parents, was in Japan when the war broke out and stayed in Japan until the war was over.  After returning to the United States, he was arrested and charged with treason for having mistreated American [[prisoners of war]].  Kawakita claimed he could not be found guilty of treason because he had lost his U.S. citizenship while in Japan, but this argument was rejected by the courts (including the Supreme Court), which ruled that he had in fact retained his U.S. citizenship during the war.  Originally [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], Kawakita's sentence was [[commutation of sentence|commuted]] to life imprisonment, and he was eventually released from prison, deported to Japan, and barred from ever returning to the United States.

== Background ==
{{nihongo|Tomoya Kawakita|川北 友弥|''Kawakita Tomoya''}} was born in [[Calexico, California]], on September 26, 1921, of Japanese-born parents.  He was born with [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship]] due to his place of birth, and also [[Japanese nationality law#Nationality by birth|Japanese nationality]] via his parents.  After finishing high school in Calexico in 1939, Kawakita traveled to Japan with his father (a grocer and merchant).  He remained in Japan and enrolled in [[Meiji University]] in 1941.  In 1943, he registered officially as a Japanese national.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shibusawa&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Shibusawa, Naoko |title=America's Geisha Ally: Reimagining the Japanese Enemy |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-674-02348-2 |pages=140–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}}&lt;ref name=Chuman&gt;{{cite book | author=Chuman, Frank F. | title=The Bamboo People: The Law and Japanese-Americans | publisher=Publisher's Inc. | location=Del Mar, California | year=1976 | isbn=0-89163-013-9 |pages=288–290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawakita was in Japan when the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] drew the United States and Japan into World War II.  In 1943, he took a job as an interpreter at a mining and metal processing plant which used [[Allied powers|Allied]] [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) as laborers.&lt;ref name=Kim_HC&gt;{{cite book | title=A Legal History of Asian Americans, 1790–1990 | author=Kim, Hyung-chan | publisher=Greenwood Press | location=Westport, Connecticut | year=1994 | isbn=0-313-29142-X |pages=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By early 1945, the population of the POW camp included about four hundred captured American troops.  After the end of the war, Kawakita renewed his U.S. passport, explaining away his having registered as a Japanese national by claiming he had acted under duress.  He returned to the U.S. in 1946 and enrolled at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name=Shibusawa /&gt;{{rp|142}}

In October 1946, a former POW saw Kawakita in a Los Angeles [[department store]] and recognized him from the war.  He reported this encounter to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and in June 1947, Kawakita was arrested and charged with multiple counts of [[Treason#United States|treason]] arising from alleged abuse of American POWs.&lt;ref name=Shibusawa /&gt;{{rp|140, 141}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Not_Worth_Living&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~eo9066/Kawakita.html |title=Not Worth Living |publisher=''[[TIME Magazine]]'' |date=October 18, 1948 |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=POW_Camp_Atrocities&gt;{{cite newspaper | title=POW Camp Atrocities Led to Treason Trial | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/20/local/me-onthelaw20 | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=September 20, 2002 | accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and appeal==
At Kawakita's trial, presided over by [[U.S. District Judge]] [[William C. Mathes]], the defense conceded that Kawakita had acted abusively toward American POWs, but argued that his actions were relatively minor, and that in any event, they could not constitute treason against the United States because Kawakita was not a U.S. citizen at the time, having lost his U.S. citizenship when he confirmed his Japanese nationality in 1943.&lt;ref name=Shibusawa /&gt;{{rp|145}}  The prosecution argued that Kawakita had known he was still a U.S. citizen and still owed allegiance to the country of his birth—citing the statements he had made to consular officials when applying for a new passport as evidence that he had never intended to give up his U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref name=Shibusawa /&gt;{{rp|146}}

[[File:Tomoya Kawakita 1948 small.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Tomoya Kawakita at his trial|Tomoya Kawakita, in a photograph taken at his 1948 trial for treason]]
Judge Mathes's instructed the jury that if they found that Kawakita had genuinely believed he was no longer a U.S. citizen, then he must be found not guilty of treason.&lt;ref name=POW_Camp_Atrocities /&gt;  During the course of their deliberations, the jury reported several times that they were hopelessly [[hung jury|deadlocked]], but the judge insisted each time that they continue trying to reach a unanimous verdict.  In the end—on September 2, 1948—the jury found Kawakita guilty of eight of the thirteen counts of treason against him, and he was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]].&lt;ref name=Shibusawa /&gt;{{rp|155–156}}&lt;ref name=Chuman /&gt;  As a consequence of his conviction for treason, Kawakita's U.S. citizenship was also revoked.&lt;ref name=Kelly_Dual&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dual Nationality, the Myth of Election, and a Kinder, Gentler State Department | last=Kelly | first=H. Ansgar | journal=University of Miami Inter-American Law Review | year=1992 | volume=23 | pages=421–464 | url=http://repository.law.miami.edu/umialr/vol23/iss2/4/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|431}}  In passing sentence, Mathes said: &quot;Reflection leads to the conclusion that the only worthwhile use for the life of a traitor, such as this defendant has proved to be, is to serve as an example to those of weak moral fiber who may hereafter be tempted to commit treason against the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=Not_Worth_Living /&gt;&lt;ref name=POW_Camp_Atrocities /&gt;

Kawakita appealed to a three-judge panel of the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], which unanimously upheld the verdict and death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;''Tomoya Kawakita v. United States'', 190 F.2d 506 (9th Cir. 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Certiorari]] was granted by the United States Supreme Court,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kawakita_certiorari&quot;&gt;''Kawakita v. United States'', 342 U.S. 932 (1952). &quot;Certiorari granted.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and oral arguments before the Supreme Court were heard on April 3, 1952.&lt;ref name=Kawakita&gt;''Kawakita v. United States'', {{ussc|343|717|1952}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
[[File:Justice William O Douglas.jpg|right|thumb|alt=William O. Douglas|[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[William O. Douglas]] wrote the opinion of the Court in the ''Kawakita'' case.]]
In a 4–3 decision issued on June 2, 1952, the Supreme Court upheld Kawakita's treason conviction and death sentence.&lt;ref name=Chuman /&gt;  The Court's opinion was written by [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[William O. Douglas]], joined by Associate Justices [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley F. Reed]], [[Robert H. Jackson]], and [[Sherman Minton]].

The Court's majority [[holding (law)|held]] that the jury in Kawakita's trial had been justified in concluding that he had not lost or given up his U.S. citizenship while he was in Japan during the war.&lt;ref name=Kawakita /&gt;{{rp|720–732}} The Court added that an American citizen owed allegiance to the United States, and could be found guilty of treason, no matter where he lived—even for actions committed in another country that also claimed him as a citizen.&lt;ref name=Kim_HC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawakita /&gt;{{rp|732–736}}  Further, given the flagrant nature of Kawakita's actions, the majority found that the trial judge had not acted arbitrarily in imposing a death sentence.&lt;ref name=Kawakita /&gt;{{rp|744–745}}

=== Dissent ===
[[File:FredVinsonReadingBook.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson|[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Fred M. Vinson]] wrote the dissent in the ''Kawakita'' case.]]
[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Fred M. Vinson]] authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Associate Justices [[Hugo Black]] and [[Harold Hitz Burton|Harold H. Burton]]. The dissent concluded that &quot;for over two years, [Kawakita] was consistently demonstrating his allegiance to Japan, not the United States.  As a matter of law, he expatriated himself as well as that can be done.&quot;  On this basis, the dissenting justices would have reversed Kawakita's treason conviction.&lt;ref name=Kim_HC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawakita /&gt;{{rp|746}}

== Subsequent developments ==
On October 29, 1953, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] [[commutation of sentence|commuted]] Kawakita's sentence to life imprisonment plus a $10,000 fine.&lt;ref name=ike_commute&gt;{{cite newspaper | url=http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs5/kawakita1.pdf | title=Eisenhower Spares Life of U.S. Traitor | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date=November 3, 1953 | accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the commutation of his sentence, Kawakita was transferred to the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]].&lt;ref name=ike_commute /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fading Voices of Alcatraz | page=126 | author=Champion, Jerry Lewis, Jr. | year=2011 | publisher=AuthorHouse | isbn=978-1-4567-1487-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, on October 24, 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]]—in what would be one of his last official acts before his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]]—ordered Kawakita released from prison on the condition that he leave the United States and be banned from ever returning.&lt;ref name=Chuman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim_HC /&gt;  Kawakita flew to Japan on December 13, 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | url=http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs5/kawakita2.pdf | title=Kawakita, War Criminal, in Tokyo as a Japanese | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date=December 13, 1963 | accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reacquired Japanese citizenship upon his arrival.&lt;ref name=Kelly_Dual /&gt;{{rp|431}}  In 1978, Kawakita sought permission to travel to the United States to visit his parents' grave, but his efforts were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Kelly_Dual /&gt;{{rp|431–432}}  As of late 1993, he was living quietly with relatives in Japan.&lt;ref name=Shimojima&gt;{{cite book | title=Amerika kokka hangyakuzai | script-title=ja:アメリカ国家反逆罪 | trans-title=American Treason | author=Shimojima, Tetsuro | publisher=[[Kodansha]] | year=1993 | place=Tokyo | isbn=978-4-06-206120-9 | page=378 | quote=あまりにも劇的な人生を送った川北友弥氏はいま七十二歳、静かな余生を暖かな家族に囲まれて過ごしている。(Mr. Tomoya Kawakita, having lived an exceptionally dramatic life, is now 72 years old and is quietly spending his final years surrounded by his family.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
