== Background ==
{{See also|Caucasus Campaign}}

===Political situation===
Following the [[February Revolution]], a [[Special Transcaucasian Committee]], including Armenian, Azerbaijani and Georgian representatives, was established to administer parts of the [[South Caucasus]] under the control of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. After the [[October Revolution]], on 11 November 1917, this committee was replaced by the [[Transcaucasian Commissariat]], also known as the ''Sejm'', with headquarters in [[Tiflis]]. The [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic#Legislature|Sejm]] opposed Bolshevism and sought separation of the South Caucasus from Bolshevik Russia. To prevent that, on 13 November 1917, a group of Bolsheviks and [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]] (SR) proclaimed the Baku Soviet, a governing body which assumed power over the territory of [[Baku Governorate]] under the leadership of Bolshevik [[Stepan Shahumyan]]. Although the Baku Soviet included Azerbaijanis and Armenians who were neither Bolsheviks nor necessarily sympathetic towards Bolshevik ideas,&lt;ref name=&quot; Hopkirk&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Like hidden fire.

The Baku-based [[Musavat]] dominated the [[Azerbaijani National Council|Muslim National Councils]] (MNCs), a representative body which eventually formed the first Parliament of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR). [[Mammad Hasan Hajinski]] chaired the Temporary Executive Committee for the MNCs, while [[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]], [[Alimardan Topchubashev]], [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]] and other prominent political figures were among the 44 Azerbaijani delegates to the Sejm. Meanwhile, the ARF, which was established in [[Tiflis]], formed a 27-member Armenian delegation to the Sejm. The leader of the Baku Soviet, Shahumyan, kept contacts with ARF and viewed it as a source of support for eliminating Musavat influence in Baku.&lt;ref name=&quot;swietochowski&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical dictionary of Azerbaijan |last=Swietochowski |first=Tadeusz |authorlink= |author2=Collins, Brian C. |year=1999 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=0-8108-3550-9 |page=117 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjIZ6ymyNO8C&amp;pg=PA117 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that during the March Days of 1918, one of the ARF founders, [[Stepan Zorian]], was present in Baku.

[[File:Shahumyan.jpg|thumb|[[Stepan Shahumyan]], an ethnic [[Armenian people|Armenian]] leader of the Bolshevik Baku Soviet]]
After the [[October Revolution]], the Russian army fell apart and its units fled the front lines en masse, often harassing local residents. Concerned with the situation, the Sejm established a Military Council of Nationalities, with Armenian, Azerbaijani and Georgian representatives, which had troops at its disposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;kazemzadeh83&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Kazemzadeh|1950|pp=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a large group of Russian soldiers withdrew from the Ottoman front line in January 1918, the head of the council, Georgian Menshevik [[Noe Ramishvili]], ordered their disarmament. The Russian soldiers were stopped near Shamkhor station and, upon a refusal to surrender, were attacked by Azerbaijani bands in what became known as the ''Shamkhor massacre''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kazemzadeh83&quot; /&gt; The Baku Soviet played out this incident into its favor against the Sejm.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;{{quote|Here is what Bakinsky Rabochy reports about it:{{quotation|In the first half of January 1918, on the railway line between Tiflis and Yelizavetpol, armed bands of Moslems many thousand strong, headed by members of the Yelizavetpol Moslem National Committee and with the support of an armoured train sent by the Transcaucasian Commissariat, forcibly disarmed a number of military units leaving for Russia. Thousands of Russian soldiers were killed or mutilated; the railway line was strewn with their corpses. They were deprived of about 15,000 rifles, some 70 machine guns and a score of artillery pieces.}}|{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1918/03/26.htm |title=Transcaucasian Counter-revolutionaries Under a Socialist Mask |author=Joseph Stalin |date=March 26–27, 1918 |work= |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10–24 February 1918, the [[Transcaucasian Commissariat|Sejm]] adopted a declaration of independence, proclaiming the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. In the meantime, to support Armenian resistance against the Ottoman Empire, the British government attempted to re-organize and train a group of Armenians from the Caucasus under the leadership of General [[Lionel Dunsterville]] in Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;p788&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Northcote|1922|pp=788}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies had also provided Armenians with 6,500,000 rubles ($3,250,000 of 1918 value) in financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Pasdermadjian|1918|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Armenian National Organization of the Caucasus formed an Armenian Military Committee in [[Petrograd]] under General Bagradouni and called upon all Armenian military personnel scattered throughout Russia to mobilize on the Caucasus front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pas192&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Pasdermadjian|1918|pp=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this call, by early March 1918, a large number of Armenians had gathered in Baku, joining a group of 200 trained officers accompanied by General Bagradouni and the ARF co-founder [[Stepan Zorian]] (Mr. Rostom).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pas192&quot; /&gt;

The Azerbaijanis grew increasingly suspicious that Shahumyan, who was an ethnic Armenian, was conspiring with the Dashnaks against them. The units of [[Savage Division]], composed of Caucasian Muslims who had served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]], disarmed a pro-Bolshevik garrison in [[Lankaran]], and Dagestani insurgents under Imam Najm ul-din Gotsinski drove the Bolsheviks out of [[Makhachkala|Petrovsk]], severing Baku's land communications with Bolshevik Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swietochowski113&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Swietochowski|2004|pp=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Armistice of Erzincan]], followed by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] signed on 3 March 1918, formalized Russia's exit from [[World War I]]. According to [[Richard G. Hovannisian]], a secret annex to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk obligated the Bolsheviks to demobilize and dissolve ethnic Armenian bands on territories previously under Russian control.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. &quot;Armenia's Road to Independence&quot;, pp. 288-289.&lt;/ref&gt; At the subsequent [[Trabzon Peace Conference]], the Ottoman delegation called for a unified position of the Sejm before the negotiations could be completed. The Bolsheviks grew increasingly concerned about the emerging Transcaucasian Federation, and in the given situation, had to choose between Musavat and ARF in the struggle to dominate Transcaucasia's largest city. Thus the Baku Soviet was drawn into the nationalistic struggle between the Azerbaijanis and the Armenians, trying to utilize one people against the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Kazemzadeh|1950|pp=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Baku produced 7 million tons of oil per year (about 15% of global oil production), during World War I the city remained in the sights of the major warring powers. Even though most of the oil fields were owned by Azerbaijanis and less than 5 per cent by Armenians, most of the production/distribution rights in Baku were owned by foreign investors, primarily the British. At the beginning of 1918, Germany transferred General [[Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein]] from the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] to establish the [[German Caucasus Expedition]] with the aim of capturing Baku. In response, in February 1918, the British dispatched General [[Lionel Dunsterville]] with troops to Baku through [[Enzeli]], in order to block the German move and to protect the British investments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviet&quot;&gt;&quot;Soviet Russia&quot; published by Russian Soviet Government Bureau, 1920, page 236&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks lost control of the [[Grozny]] oilfields at the end of 1917, and Baku became their sole source of oil. [[Vladimir Lenin]] even asserted in one of his speeches that &quot;Soviet Russia can't survive without Baku oil.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

=== Demographics and armed groups ===
[[File:Azerbaijani victims in Baku with consul from Iran.jpg|300px|thumb|Postcard from [[Iran]]. [[Iran]]ian consul M.S. Vezare-Maragai near [[muslim]] ([[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]]) victims in [[Baku]] after March days]]
Before World War I, the population of [[Baku]], including the Bailoff promontory, the White Town, the oil fields and the neighboring villages, amounted to over 200,000, distributed as follows: 74,000 temporary migrants from various parts of [[Russia]], 56,000 [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] natives of the town and district, 25,000 [[Armenian people|Armenian]]s, 18,000 [[Persian people|Persian]]s, 6,000 Jews, 4,000 [[Volga Tatars]], 3,800 [[Lezgins]], 2,600 [[Georgians]], 5,000 [[Germans]], 1,500 [[Poles]] and many other nationalities numbering less than 1,000 each. [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] formed the majority among natives and owned the greater part of land including the oil fields. They also constituted most of the labor force and small trading class as well as some commercial and financial posts. The petroleum industry was largely owned by a small number of foreign capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Villari &quot;Fire and sword in the Caucasus,&quot; page 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1918 March events, the major armed groups in Baku consisted of 6,000 men from the remnants of the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] which had withdrawn from the Ottoman front line, about 4,000 men of the [[Armenian militia]] organized under the ARF Dashnaktsutiun,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephan63&quot;&gt;Stepan Shahumyan. Letters 1896-1918. State Publishing House of Armenia, Yerevan, 1959; pages 63-67.&lt;/ref&gt; and an undefined number of soldiers of the [[Savage Division]] disbanded in January 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Altstadt|1992|pp=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events of 30 March – 2 April 1918 ==
[[File:4 march days 1918.jpg|thumb|Bazarnaya Street (modern day Azerbaijan Avenue) during the March days in 1918.]]
When the staff of the disbanded [[Savage Division]] arrived in Baku on 9 March 1918, the Soviet immediately arrested its commander, General Talyshinski. The move sparked protests from the Azerbaijani population, with occasional calls to offer armed resistance to the Soviet. According to the [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Iranian Azerbaijani]] historian [[Firuz Kazemzadeh]], Shahumyan could have prevented bloodshed, had he been less impulsive and stubborn. Only a few days earlier, Shahumyan had received a telegram from [[Lenin]], in which he was advised &quot;to learn diplomacy&quot;, but this advice was ignored.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;{{quote|Dear Comrade Shahumyan:&lt;br&gt;Many thanks for the letter. We are delighted by your firm and decisive policy; do unite with it a most cautious diplomacy, which is doubtlessly made necessary by the present most difficult situation, and we shall win.&lt;br&gt;The difficulties are unfathomable; up to now we have been saved by the contradictions and conflicts and the struggle among imperialists. Be able to use these conflicts; now it is necessary to learn diplomacy.&lt;br&gt;Best wishes and greetings to all the friends.|V. Ulyanov (Lenin)|Stepan Shahumyan, Статьи и речи, Bakinskii Rabochii, Articles and speeches of the Bolshevik Extraordinary Commissar for the Caucasus, 1924, p. 224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The March 1918 confrontation was triggered by an incident with the steamship ''Evelina''. On 27 March 1918, fifty former [[Savage Division]] servicemen arrived in Baku on this ship to attend the funeral of their colleague Mamed Tagiyev, son of a famous Azerbaijani oil magnate and philanthropist, [[Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev]]. M. Tagiyev had been killed in a skirmish with Russian-Armenian forces in [[Lenkoran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Russian Revolution as National Revolution: Tragic Deaths and Rituals of Remembrance in Muslim Azerbaijan (1907–1920),&quot; Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas, vol. 49 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state that when the soldiers got back onboard the ''Evelina'' to sail out of Baku on 30 March 1918, the Soviet received information that the Muslim crew of the ship was armed and waiting for a signal to revolt against the Soviet. While the report lacked foundation, the Soviet acted on it, disarming the crew which tried to resist.&lt;ref name=&quot;dokumenty&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title={{lang|ru|Документы по истории гражданской войны в СССР.

By 6 p.m. on 30 March 1918, Baku was filled with fighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;thchalkhouchian85&quot;&gt;G. Tchalkhouchian. ''Le livre rouge'', Paris, Veradzenout, 1919, pp. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet side, led by Shahumyan, realized that full civil war was starting and its own forces were insufficient against Azerbaijani masses led by [[Musavat]]. Allies were found among the [[Mensheviks]], [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|SRs]], and the [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]] (right-wing liberals), which promised to support the Bolsheviks as the champions of the &quot;Russian Cause.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;B. Baikov. ''Воспоминания о революции в Закавказии'', Memoirs of Russian Kadet in Baku 1917 - 1920, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these, Musavat's ''Achiq Söz'' newspaper noted that while Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were fighting all year, both were uniting against Musavat even with the Kadets and the Dashnaks. The paper attributed such alliance to national factors, and concluded that the Soviet's attempt to provoke &quot;one nationality against another, instead of fighting a class war, was a tragic capitulation of democracy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Achiq Söz'', No. 627, 1918, cited in {{Harv|Ratgauzer|1927|pp=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 31 March, Azerbaijanis opposed to the Bolshevik disarming of the Savage Division held protests in Baku, demanding to arm the Muslims. The Azerbaijani Bolshevik organization Hümmet attempted to mediate the dispute, proposing that the arms taken from the Savage Division be transferred to the custody of the Hümmet. Shahumyan agreed to this proposal, but on the afternoon of 31 March, when Muslim representatives appeared before the Baku Soviet leadership to take the arms, shots were already being heard in the city and the Soviet commissar [[Prokofy Dzhaparidze]] refused to provide the arms. He informed the Hümmet leadership that &quot;Musavat had launched a political war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;altstadt86&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rgsunycommune&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Suny|1972|pp=217–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talks broke off abruptly when the Soviet's soldiers were fired upon. The Bolsheviks accused the Muslims of responsibility for the incident, stopped negotiations, and opened hostilities. Later Shahumyan admitted that the Bolsheviks deliberately used a pretext to attack their political opponents:

{{quotation|We needed to give a rebuff, and we exploited the opportunity of the first attempt at an armed assault on our cavalry unit and began an attack on the whole front. Due to the efforts of both the local Soviet and the Military-revolutionary committee of the Caucasus Army, which moved here (from Tiflis and Sarikamish) we already had armed forces - about 6,000 strong. [[Dashnaktsutiun]] also had 3,000 - 4,000 strong national forces, which were at our disposal. The participation of the latter lent the civil war, to some extent, the character of an ethnic massacre, however, it was impossible to avoid it. We were going for it deliberately. The Muslim poor suffered severely, however they are now rallying around the Bolsheviks and the Soviet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephan63&quot;/&gt;}}

Armenians initially remained neutral as the Muslim rebellion against the Soviet began. The Musavat Party proposed an alliance with the Dashnaks, but was given a rebuff. The Armenian leadership withdrew its forces to the Armenian areas of Baku and limited its action to self-defense. On the evening of 31 March, machine-gun and rifle fire in Baku intensified into a full-fledged battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;rgsunycommune&quot;/&gt; On the morning of 1 April 1918, the Committee of Revolutionary Defense of Baku's Soviet issued a leaflet which said:

{{quotation|In view of the fact that the counterrevolutionary Musavat party declared war on the Soviet of Workers', Soldiers', and Sailors' Deputies in the city of Baku and thus threatened the existence of the government of the revolutionary democracy, Baku is declared to be in a state of siege&lt;ref name=&quot;rgsunycommune&quot;/&gt;}}

Forced to seek support from either Muslim Musavat or Armenian Dashnaktsutyun, Shahumyan, himself an Armenian, chose the latter. Following initial skirmishes in the streets, the Dashnaks proceeded to initiate a massacre, wildly killing Musavat military elements and Muslim civilians alike without mercy or discrimination in both Baku and the surrounding countryside.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{cite book|last=Alex|first=Marshall|title=The Caucasus Under Soviet Rule|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn= 9780415410120|pages=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0mlUS7rlhcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq|edition=Volume 12 of Routledge Studies in the History of Russia and Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were descriptions of Dashnak forces taking to looting, burning and killing in the Muslim sections of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swietochowski116&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Swietochowski|2004|pp=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Hopkirk]], &quot;Armenians, seeing that at last they had their ancient foes on the run, were now out for vengeance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot; Hopkirk&quot;/&gt; In Balakhany and Ramany districts of Baku, the majority of Muslim workers stayed at their places and avoided the battles, while the peasants were not moved to join the anti-Soviet rebels. The Persian workers remained passive during all of the fighting, refusing to take sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;rgsunycommune&quot; /&gt; Left-wing Muslim leaders, including those of SRs and Hümmet Party, such as Narimanov, Azizbekov, Bunyat Sardarov and Kazi-Magomed Aghasiyev, supported the Soviet forces&lt;ref&gt;Г.

On the afternoon on 1 April, a Muslim delegation arrived at the Hotel Astoria. The Committee of Revolutionary Defense presented them with an ultimatum&lt;ref group=notes&gt;{{quote|The contents of the ultimatum presented by the Bolsheviks and accepted by the Musavat:{{cquote|We demand the immediate end of the military activity opened against Soviet power in the city of Baku; we demand the immediate surrender of fortified posts and the destruction of trenches.

1. Open and unconditional recognition of the power of the Baku Soviet of Workers, Soldiers, and Sailors Deputies and the complete subordination to all its orders.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The &quot;Savage Division&quot; as a counterrevolutionary military units cannot be tolerated with the bounds of Baku and its districts. Other national Moslem military units, as well as Armenian ones, should be either led out of the city or subordinated completely to the Soviet. Whole armed population must be under the control and check of the Soviet.&lt;br /&gt;
3. We demand the acceptance of immediate measures to open the railroads from Baku to Tiflis and from Baku to Petrovsk.}}|{{Harv|Suny|1972|pp=217–221}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demanded that representatives of all Muslim parties sign the document before the shelling stopped. Early in the evening, the agreements were signed and the bombardment stopped.&lt;ref name=&quot;rgsunycommune&quot; /&gt; The fighting did not subside, however, till the night of 2 April 1918, when thousands of Muslims started leaving the city in a mass exodus. By the fifth day, although much of the city was still ablaze, all resistance had ceased, leaving the streets strewn with dead and wounded, nearly all of them Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot; Hopkirk&quot;/&gt; So the armed conflict between the Musavat and the joint Soviet-ARF forces ended on 3 April 1918 with the victory of the latter.

Azerbaijani delegation to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] provided the following interpretation of the March Days:
{{quotation|In that bloodthirsty episode, which had such fatal effects upon the Muslims, the principal part was played by the Armenians, who were then in Baku, clustering as elsewhere around their nationalist party [ARF]...

The commander of the military forces of the Armenians was the same General Bagradouni, who, although he lost both of his legs during the fight, continued his duties until September 14, when the Armenians and the small number of Englishmen who came to their assistance, were forced to abandon Baku to the superior forces of the Turco-Tartars, and retreat toward the city of Enzeli in the northern Caucasus|{{Harv|Pasdermadjian|1918|pp=193}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{Further|Armenian–Azerbaijani War|Battle of Baku}}
[[File:the aftermath in the tatar quarter of baku march days 1918.png|thumb|The aftermath in the Azerbaijani quarter]]
In the immediate aftermath of the March Days, many of the Muslim survivors fled to [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Elisabethpol (Ganja)]] in central Azerbaijan. While the [[Azerbaijani National Council|Temporary Executive Committee of the Muslim National Councils]] and the [[Musavat]] ceased their activities in the territory of the [[Baku Governorate]], the left-wing Azerbaijani political groups, such as the SRs and the Hümmet, benefited from the developments and became effective leaders of the Azerbaijani community in Baku. The Muslim Socialist Bureau appealed to the Committee of Revolutionary Defense to redress some of the grievances of some of the Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;rgsunycommune&quot; /&gt;

On 13 April 1918, within few days of the massacres, the Bolsheviks under the leadership of [[Stepan Shahumyan]] proclaimed the [[Baku Commune]]. This new body endeavored to nationalize Baku's oil fields, drawing the ire of the British,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviet&quot;/&gt; and formed the &quot;Red Army of Baku&quot;, an undisciplined and poorly managed force composed largely of ethnic Armenian recruits.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/serge/1930/year-one/ch06.htm Year One of the Russian Revolution | Chpt. 6&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the majority of the Commissars (the leaders of Baku Commune) were ethnic Armenians, two of them were ethnic Azeri revolutionaries, [[Meshadi Azizbekov]] and [[Mir Hasan Vazirov]]. Nevertheless, in the Azeri psyche, the Baku Commune symbolized the Bolshevik - Armenian collusion born out of the March Days bloodbath.&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Swietochowski. Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition. ISBN 0-231-07068-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The March Days of 1918 had a profound effect on the formulation of Azerbaijani political objectives as well. While previously Azerbaijani leaders had sought only autonomy within the Russian domain, after the Bolshevik-perpetrated massacres in Baku, they no longer believed in the Russian Revolution and turned to the Ottomans for support in achieving total independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Swietochowski|2004|pp=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed on 28 May 1918, its government immediately dispatched a delegation to Istanbul to discuss the possibility of Ottoman military support for the young republic. The Ottoman triumvir, [[Enver Pasha]], agreed to the Azerbaijani requests and charged his brother, [[Nuru Pasha]], with forming an Ottoman military unit, known as the [[Ottoman Army of Islam|Caucasus Army of Islam]], to retake Baku. When in July 1918, the Ottoman-Azerbaijani force defeated the &quot;Red Army of Baku&quot; in several key battles in Central Azerbaijan, Bolshevik power in Baku started crumbling under pressure from the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Russian Socialist Revolutionaries]], Dashnaks, and British agents in the city. On 1 August 1918, the Baku Commune was replaced by the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]], which desperately invited a [[Dunsterforce|1000-strong British expeditionary force]] led by General [[Lionel Dunsterville]] to the city. This proved a futile effort and, in the face of an overwhelming Ottoman-Azerbaijani offensive, the [[Dunsterforce]] fled and the Caucasus Army of Islam entered the Azerbaijani capital on 15 September 1918.

The March Days brought underlying tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis to the fore. Less than six months after the March massacres, when the [[Ottoman Army of Islam|Ottoman-Azerbaijani force]] entered Baku, the city fell into chaos and [[September Days|nearly 10,000 Armenians were massacred]].&lt;ref name=&quot;marshall&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caucasus under Soviet rule |last=Marshall |first=Alex |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location= |isbn=0-415-41012-6 |page=96 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0mlUS7rlhcC&amp;pg=PA96 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special commission formed by the [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians|Armenian National Council]] (ANC) reported a total of 8,988 ethnic Armenians massacred, among whom were 5,248 Armenian inhabitants of Baku, 1,500 Armenian refugees from other parts of the Caucasus who were in Baku, and 2,240 Armenians whose corpses were found in the streets but whose identities were never established.&lt;ref name=&quot;kazemzadeh143&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Kazemzadeh|1950|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these figures were gathered by the Armenian National Council, and have been questioned by some,&lt;ref name=&quot;kazemzadeh143&quot; /&gt; given the general run of events, they were unlikely to be greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;B. Ishkhanian. ''Великие ужасы в городе Баку'', Tiflis, 1920, pp. 28-30 quoted {{Harv|Kazemzadeh|1950|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While trying to escape Baku amidst the Ottoman-Azerbaijani offensive, the Bolshevik Baku Commissars were taken by ship across the Caspian to Krasnovodsk, where they were imprisoned by the Social Revolutionary [[Transcaspian Government]], with the alleged support of the British. A few days later, on 20 September 1918, between the stations of Pereval and Akhcha-Kuyma on the [[Trans-Caspian railway]], 26 of the Commissars were executed by firing squad.&lt;ref name=&quot;marshall&quot; /&gt;

== Analysis and interpretations ==
According to Michael Smith, Muslims faced a crushing defeat at the hands of Baku Soviet followed by an &quot;unrestrained brutality of Dashnak forces&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;/&gt; While in the aftermath of the tragic events, Musavat used them to foster a national memory of pain, its leader [[Mammad Emin Rasulzade|M. E. Rasulzade]] provided an analysis which seems to reflect the essence of witness accounts. In Rasulzade's view, Bolsheviks and their supporters sought to diminish Musavat's influence among Azerbaijani masses for a long time, and Muslim elites felt frustrated and powerless in face of this pressure. March Days were a violent culmination in this assault of Russian Bolshevism against the unprepared Azerbaijani people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;/&gt;

=== Azerbaijani position ===
[[File:Armenia in Paris Peace Conference 1919.jpg|thumb|Azeri sources say that the idea of a &quot;[[Greater Armenia (political concept)|Greater Armenia]]&quot; was used in order to &quot;justify&quot; the attempts to create [the Baku commune] on Azerbaijani land&lt;ref name=&quot;decree&quot;/&gt;]]

The leader of [[Musavat]] [[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]] stated with regard to the March Days:
{{quotation|Musavat was blamed for the March events. It is absolutely baseless, because to declare a war one must possess at least some physical strength, which Musavat lacked. Others accuse Musavat that it provoked the March events by defending the idea of autonomy for Azerbaijan. This could resemble the truth to a certain extent. If we obediently bowed to the enemies of our freedom, these events might not have happened. But we could not have done that. We openly claimed the autonomy for Azerbaijan, and this increased the number of our enemies.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Azerbaijan&quot; newspaper, 6 December 1919&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Soviet Azerbaijan]], historical accounts of March Days were made to support the actions of Baku Soviet and to condemn Musavat as the culprit of the tragedy. Soviet historiography also tried to suppress the memory of 1918 massacres and omitted the fact that Bolsheviks used the Armenian-Azerbaijani ethnic confrontation to gain power. However, in 1978, then-leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, [[Heydar Aliyev]] recalled the forgotten March Days in his speech dedicated to the 100th anniversary of [[Stepan Shahumyan]] as follows:
{{quotation|In March 1918, the Musavatist anti-Soviet rebellion was raised in Baku, intending to strangle the Soviet Government. Thanks to the firm and resolute action of the Bolsheviks, however, the rebellion was extinguished.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Алиев Г.А. Мужественный борец за дело Ленина, за коммунизм. К 100-летию со дня рождения С.Г. Шаумяна. Доклад на торжественном собрании, посвященном 100-летию со дня рождения С.Г. Шаумяна. Баку. 11 октября 1978 года. Баку. 1978. С.16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Exactly twenty years later, as the President of independent [[Azerbaijan]], Heydar Aliyev issued a decree condemning March Days as the beginning of Azerbaijani genocide. Text of the 1998 Presidential decree describes the March events as follows:
{{quotation|&quot;Taking advantage of the situation following the end of the First World War and the February and October 1917 revolutions in Russia, the Armenians began to pursue the implementation of their plans under the banner of Bolshevism. Under the watchword of combating counter-revolutionary elements, in March 1918 the Baku commune began to implement a criminal plan aimed at eliminating Azerbaijanis from the whole of Baku province&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;decree&quot;/&gt;}}

=== Soviet position ===
The Baku Soviet's Committee of Revolutionary Defense issued a proclamation early in April explaining the events and their causes. The statement claimed an anti-Soviet character of the rebellion and blamed [[Musavat]] and its leadership for the events. Soviet's statement asserted that there was a carefully laid out conspiracy by [[Musavat]] to overthrow the Baku Soviet and to establish its own regime:

{{quotation|The enemies of Soviet power in the city of Baku have raised their head. The malice and hatred with which they viewed the revolutionary organ of the workers and soldiers began recently to overflow into open counterrevolutionary activities. The appearance of the staff of the Savage Division, headed by the unmasked Talyshkhanov, the events in Lenkoran, in Mugan, and at Shemakha, the capture of Petrovsk by the Daghestan regiment and the withholding of grain shipments from Baku, the threats of Elisavetpol, and in the last few days of Tiflis, to march on Baku, against soviet power, the aggressive movements of the armored train of the Transcaucasian Commissariat in Adzhikabul, and, finally, the outrageous behavior of the Savage Division on the steamship Evelina in shooting comrades--all this speaks of the criminal plans of the counterrevolutionaries grouped mainly around the Bek party Musavat and having as its goal the overthrow of Soviet power.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;rgsunycommune&quot; /&gt;}}

Shahumian considered the March events to be a triumph of the Soviet power in the Caucasus:

{{quotation|Transcaucasia has entered a period of active armed struggle for the Soviet power. For three days, 30th, 31 March and 1 April, a furious battle raged in the city of Baku. On one side were fighting the Soviet Red Guard; the Red International Army, recently organized by us; the Red Fleet, which we had succeeded in reorganizing in a short time; and Armenian national units. On the other side the Muslim Savage Division in which there were quite a few Russian officers, and bands of armed Muslims, led by the Musavat Party... For us the results of the battle were brilliant. The destruction of the enemy was complete. We dictated to them the conditions which were signed without reservation. More than three thousand were killed on both sides. The Soviet power in Baku has always been hanging by a thread, due to the resistance of Muslim nationalistic parties. These parties led by feudal intelligentsia (beks and khans), which settled in Elisavetpol and Tiflis thanks to the degraded and cowardly politics of the [[Mensheviks]] became very aggressive in Baku too. ... If they had taken the control of Baku, the city would have been declared the capital of [[Azerbaijan]] and all non-Muslim elements would have been disarmed and killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stepan Shahumyan]]. Letters 1896-1918 State Publishing House of Armenia, Yerevan, 1959; pages 63-67.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the opinion of the American historian Tadeusz Swietochowski, &quot;in his enthusiasm, Shahumyan might not have remembered that in 1905 he himself had accused the [[tsardom]] of reaping in benefits of the [[Armenian–Tatar massacres 1905-1907|Muslim-Armenian massacres]]. It is doubtful that to him, as opposed to the Azerbaijanis, any similarity suggested itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Swietochowski|2004|pp=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stalin]], who was Bolshevik People's Commissar at the time, tried to justify the provoking of the ''March Days'' by the Baku Soviet in &quot;Pravda&quot; newspaper: ''&quot;While the center of Muslims, Baku, the citadel of Soviet power in Transcaucasus, unified around itself the entire Eastern Transcaucasus, from Lenkoran and Kuba till Elizavetpol, with arms in hands is asserting the rights of people of Transcaucasus, who try by all forces to maintain a link with Soviet Russia&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrono.ru/libris/stalin/4-58.html J. Stalin. &quot;Положение на Кавказе&quot;, ''Правда'', № 100, 23 May 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Serge]] in ''Year One (First Year) Of the Russian Revolution'': &quot;The Soviet at Baku, led by Shahumyan, was meanwhile making itself the ruler of the area, discreetly but unmistakably. Following the Moslem rising of 18 (30) March, it had to introduce a dictatorship. This rising, instigated by the Musavat, set the Tartar and Turkic population, led by their reactionary bourgeoisie, against the Soviet, which consisted of Russians with support from the Armenians. The races began to slaughter each other in the street. Most of the Turkic port-workers (the ''ambal'') either remained neutral or supported the Reds. The contest was won by the Soviets.&quot;

===Armenian position===
The Armenian view of the March 1918 events was documented in a letter written by Archbishop Bagrat to the American mission in [[Baku]]. The letter began with the accusation that the Azerbaijanis, being the disciples of the Turks and the [[Germany|Germans]], could not be trusted. Having thus disposed of the Azerbaijani version of the events, Bagrat stated that the battle was waged by the Musavat and the Soviet, while the Armenians remained neutral. The Archbishop claimed that some Armenian soldiers took part in the fighting, but that those were only isolated individuals for whom the Armenian National Council could not be held responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;kazemzadeh73&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Kazemzadeh|1950|pp=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also claimed that the Armenians gave shelter to some 20,000 Muslims during the struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Loris-Melikof. ''La revolution russe et les nouvelles Republiques Transcaucasiennes,'' Paris, Felix Alcan, 1920, pp. 115-117.&lt;/ref&gt; Persian Armenians in Baku indeed saved many lives of their fellow citizens, which may have been the basis for Bagrat's exaggerated assertion.&lt;ref name=&quot;kazemzadeh73&quot;/&gt;

Armenians had been inflamed by the sight and pitiful stories of [[Democratic Republic of Armenia#Refugee problem|several hundred thousand refugees]] who had succeeded in reaching Transcaucasia, fleeing before the Ottoman Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;herb&quot;/&gt; Consequently, when the Russian Army broke up, the Armenians preserved their discipline against all attempts of the Bolsheviks, and were the only force upon which the Allies could count in southwestern Asia during the last year of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;herb&quot;/&gt; The two million Armenians of Transcaucasia, increased by several hundred thousand refugees from the Ottoman Empire, persisted in their loyalty to Russia until the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk delivered them to the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;herb&quot;/&gt; Then they moved to form their own state, which succeeded in maintaining itself during the period of anarchy and famine that Bolshevism brought upon the Russian Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;herb&quot;/&gt; At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference]], speaking before the Council of Ten, [[Avetis Aharonyan|M. Aharonian]], delegate of the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia|Armenian Republic of the Caucasus]], stated that the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia#Population|two and a half million Armenians in Transcaucasia]] wanted to cast in their fortunes with the [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians of Ottoman Empire]] to form a [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Greater Armenia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herb&quot;&gt;[[Herbert Adams Gibbons]], (1919), The New Map of Asia (1900-1919), Published by The Century Co., page 321&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michael P.

===Other positions===
According to [[Firuz Kazemzadeh]], the Soviet provoked March events to eliminate its most formidable rival - the Musavat. However, when Soviet leaders reached out to ARF for assistance against the Azerbaijani nationalists, the conflict degenerated into a massacre with the Armenians killing the Muslims irrespective of their political affiliations or social and economic position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Kazemzadeh|1950|pp=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International recognition===
On 27 March 2012, the [[New York State Senate]] adopted the first-ever legislative resolution J3784-2011 proclaiming 31 March 2012 as the Azerbaijani Remembrance Day and describing March Days as the genocide &quot;committed  by  the members  of  Armenian  Dashnak  party in concert with Bolsheviks against Azerbaijanis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/J3784-2011 |title=J3784-2011: Memorializing Governor Andrew M.

On 31 December 2010, Governor [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]] of the U.S. State of [[Nevada]] proclaimed 31 March as Remembrance Day of the 1918 [[massacre]]s of Azerbaijani civilians in what became the first such recognition by the U.S. government institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nevada governor proclaims 31 March Azerbaijani Remembrance Day|url=http://www.news.az/articles/politics/29254|publisher=news.az|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
