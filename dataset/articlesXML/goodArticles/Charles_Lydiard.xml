'''Charles Lydiard''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 13 May 1780&amp;nbsp;– 29 December 1807) was an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] who served during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Lydiard's origins are obscure, but he joined the navy in 1780 and rose through the ranks after distinguished service in the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars, particularly during the [[Siege of Toulon]]. He saw action in several engagements in the Mediterranean, and had a part in the defeat of a French frigate in 1795. The chance for promotion passed him by however when the French ship escaped. He again demonstrated his qualities on a cutting-out expedition under the guns of a French shore battery, and this time was successful in escaping with his prize. He was promoted and appointed to the command of his prize, and went on to be captain of several small vessels before a period of unemployment caused by his promotion to [[post-captain]]. He returned to active service in 1805 with command of the [[razee]] {{HMS|Anson|1781|6}}, in which ship he distinguished himself in a number of incidents in the [[West Indies]], capturing a Spanish frigate, attacking a French ship of the line, and helping to capture the island of [[Curaçao]].  He returned to Britain after these exploits, but his ship was caught in a gale, and despite his best efforts, was driven ashore and wrecked. Lydiard did his utmost to save as many of his men as he could, before being swept away and drowned.

==Early life==
Lydiard's origins are largely unknown, but his entry to the navy is recorded as being on 13 May 1780, when he joined the 100-gun {{HMS|Britannia|1762|6}} as a captain's servant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Britannia'' was at this time the [[flagship]] of Vice-Admiral [[George Darby]], commander of the [[Channel Fleet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell188&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=The naval history of Great Britain |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lydiard was appointed an [[able seaman]] on 25 July 1781, and on 27 May 1782 was transferred to the 44-gun {{HMS|Resistance|1782|6}}, at first as an able seaman, but receiving a promotion to [[midshipman]] on 12 October that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;/&gt; He went on to serve aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Bombay Castle|1782|6}} and {{HMS|Edgar|1779|6}}, and passed his lieutenant's examination on 27 May 1791.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;/&gt; He was serving with [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood's]] fleet during the [[Siege of Toulon|occupation of Toulon]] in the early months of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Lydiard distinguished himself with his actions during the hard-fought defence of Fort Mulgrave, and received his commission on 25 November 1793.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;/&gt;

==Lieutenancy==
He then became first lieutenant of {{HMS|Sincere|1793|6}}, one of the prizes from Toulon, under the command of Commander [[William Shield (Royal Navy officer)|William Shield]]. Shield and Lydiard served along the French Mediterranean coast until October 1794, and were engaged in cutting-out enemy ships from French harbours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell189&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=The naval history of Great Britain |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sincere'' was then paid off and Lydiard transferred to the 74-gun {{HMS|Captain|1787|6}}, where he saw action at the [[Naval Battle of Genoa (1795)|Battle of Genoa]] on 14 March and the [[Naval Battle of Hyères Islands|Battle of Hyères Islands]] on 13 July 1795.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell189&quot;/&gt; His former commander, William Shield, had received command of the 32-gun {{HMS|Southampton|1757|6}} by July 1795, and Lydiard transferred that month to serve as his first lieutenant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell189&quot;/&gt; Lydiard remained with ''Southampton'' after Shield's replacement by Captain [[James Macnamara]] and in September 1795 they spent 15 days blockading a French grain convoy in the port of [[Genoa]].

===''Southampton'' and the French===
The convoy was protected by two frigates, the [[French frigate Vestale (1780)|''Vestale'']] and the [[French frigate Brun|''Brun'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell190&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=The naval history of Great Britain |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French finally came out on the evening of the fifteenth day, and were engaged by ''Southampton'', despite the French possessing considerably more firepower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell190&quot;/&gt; After a sustained engagement ''Southampton'' forced ''Vestale'' to [[striking the colours|strike her colours]] while the ''Brun'' escaped with the convoy, leaving ''Vestale'' to her fate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell190&quot;/&gt; But as ''Southampton'' prepared to lower her boats to take possession of the French ship, her fore-mast, which had been damaged during the engagement, went by the board.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell190&quot;/&gt; Taking advantage of this, ''Vestale'' raised her colours and escaped from the scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell190&quot;/&gt; Victory over the ''Vestale'' should have brought promotions for ''Southampton''{{'}}s officers, including Lydiard, but her escape deprived them of this. Lydiard now had to secure another triumph to ensure his promotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;/&gt;

===Capture of ''Utile''===
Lydiard's next opportunity to distinguish himself came in June 1796. On 9 June a French [[corvette]] was sighted entering [[Hyères]] bay, and Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]], commander of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]], summoned Macnamara to his [[flagship]], {{HMS|Victory}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell190&quot;/&gt; He asked Macnamara to bring out the French ship if he could. Recognising the difficulty and risk that would be involved, he did not make it a formal written order, instead instructing Macnamara 'bring out the enemy's ship if you can; I'll give you no written order; but I direct you to take care of the king's ship under your command.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell191&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=The naval history of Great Britain |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macnamara promptly took his ship in under the guns of the batteries, and apparently having been mistaken for a French or neutral frigate, closed to within pistol shot of the French ship, and demanded her captain surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell191&quot;/&gt; The captain replied with a broadside, and Macnamara brought ''Southampton'' alongside and sent Lydiard over in command of the boarders.  After subduing fierce resistance Lydiard took possession of the French ship and together he and Macnamara escaped out to sea under heavy fire from the French shore batteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell191&quot;/&gt; Macnamara wrote in a letter to Jervis {{Quote|At this period, being very near the heavy battery of Fort Breganson, I laid him instantly onboard, and Lieutenant Lydiard, at the head of the boarders, with an intrepidity that no words can describe entered and carried her in about ten minutes, although he met with a spirited resistance from the captain (who fell) and a hundred men under arms to receive him. In this short conflict, the behaviour of all the officers and ship's company of the Southampton had my full approbation, and I do not mean to take from their merit by stating to you, that the conduct of Lieutenant Lydiard was above all praise.|J. Macnamara|&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell191&quot;/&gt;}}

The prize, a 24-gun [[corvette]] named ''Utile'', was taken into service with the Royal Navy as [[Utile (1784)|HMS ''Utile'']] and Lydiard was promoted and given command of her, a commission confirmed on 22 July 1796.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield214&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1794–1817|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Command==
Lydiard spent some time in the [[Adriatic]] before returning to Britain in 1797 as a convoy escort, after which ''Utile'' was paid off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell192&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=The naval history of Great Britain |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to command the [[bomb vessel]] {{HMS|Fury|1790|6}} in May 1798, followed by the sloop {{HMS|Kite|1795|6}} in November that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield231&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1794–1817|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield263&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1794–1817|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served aboard ''Kite'' in the [[North Sea]] until his promotion to [[post-captain]] on 1 January 1801, at which point he was superseded in the command of the ''Kite''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell192&quot;/&gt; No further commands could be found for him, and the [[Peace of Amiens]] further lengthened his enforced retirement from active service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell192&quot;/&gt; He went ashore during this time, and took the opportunity to marry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;/&gt; The couple had three sons together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;/&gt;

{{Further|Action of 23 August 1806}}

Lydiard finally returned to active service in December 1805, with an appointment to command the 38-gun {{HMS|Anson|1781|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy231&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield92&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1794–1817|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anson'' had originally been a 64-gun [[third rate]], but had been [[razee]]d in 1794.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner41&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardiner|title=Frigates of the Napoleonic Wars |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sailed ''Anson'' to the [[West Indies]] in early 1806 and in August was sailing in company with Captain [[Charles Brisbane]]'s {{HMS|Arethusa|1781|6}} when on 23 August they came across the 38-gun Spanish frigate ''Pomona'' off [[Havana]], guarded by a shore battery and twelve [[gunboat]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell192&quot;/&gt; The ''Pomona'' was trying to enter the harbour, whereupon Lydiard and Brisbane bore up and engaged her.&lt;ref name=&quot;James317&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James|title=James' Naval History|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gunboats came out to defend her, whereupon the two British frigates anchored between the shore battery and gunboats on one side, and the ''Pomona'' on the other. A hard fought action began, which lasted for 35 minutes until the ''Pomona'' struck her colours.&lt;ref name=&quot;James317&quot;/&gt; Three of the gunboats were blown up, six were sunk, and the remaining three were badly damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy232&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shore battery was obliged to stop firing after an explosion in one part of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;James317&quot;/&gt; There were no casualties aboard ''Anson'', but ''Arethusa'' lost two killed and 32 wounded, with Brisbane among the latter.&lt;ref name=&quot;James317&quot;/&gt; The captured ''Pomona'' was subsequently taken into the Navy as {{HMS|Cuba|1806|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colledge85&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Colledge |title=Ships of the Royal Navy |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield202&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1794–1817|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Anson'' and ''Foudroyant''===
Lydiard remained cruising off Havana, and on 15 September sighted the French 84-gun [[French ship Foudroyant (1800)|''Foudroyant'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell193&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=The naval history of Great Britain |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Foudroyant'', carrying the flag of Vice-Admiral [[Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez|Jean-Baptiste Willaumez]], had been dismasted in a storm and was carrying a jury-rig. Despite the superiority of his opponent and the nearness of the shore Lydiard attempted to close on the French vessel and opened fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell193&quot;/&gt; ''Anson'' came under fire from the fortifications at [[Morro Castle (fortress)|Morro Castle]], while several Spanish ships, including the 74-gun ''San Lorenzo'', came out of Havana to assist the French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell194&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=The naval history of Great Britain |page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being unable to manoeuvre into a favourable position and coming under heavy fire, Lydiard hauled away and made his escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell194&quot;/&gt; ''Anson'' had two killed and 13 wounded during the engagement, while the rigging was badly cut. ''Foudroyant'' meanwhile had 27 killed or wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell194&quot;/&gt;

===Capture of Curaçao===
[[File:Capture of Curacoa.jpg|thumb|right|The capture of Curaçao, depicted by [[Thomas Whitcombe]]]]
''Anson'' was then assigned to Charles Brisbane's squadron and joined Brisbane's ''Arethusa'' and [[James Athol Wood]]'s {{HMS|Latona|1781|6}}. The ships were despatched in November 1806 by Vice-Admiral [[James Richard Dacres (1749–1810)|James Richard Dacres]] to reconnoitre [[Curaçao]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy232&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen186&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen|title=Battles of the British Navy|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined in December by {{HMS|Fisgard|1797|6}} and Brisbane decided to launch an attack on 1 January 1807.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen186&quot;/&gt; The British ships approached early in the morning of 1 January and anchored in the harbour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen186&quot;/&gt; They were attacked by the Dutch, at which Brisbane boarded and captured the 36-gun frigate ''Halstaar'', while Lydiard attacked and secured the 20-gun corvette ''Suriname''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen187&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen|title=Battles of the British Navy|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lydiard and Brisbane then led their forces on shore, and stormed [[Fort Amsterdam (Curaçao)|Fort Amsterdam]], which was defended by 270 Dutch troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen187&quot;/&gt; The fort was carried after ten minutes of fighting, after which two smaller forts, a citadel and the entire town were also taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen187&quot;/&gt; More troops were landed while the ships sailed round the harbour to attack Fort République. By 10 am the fort had surrendered, and by noon the entire island had capitulated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen187&quot;/&gt; Lydiard was sent back to Britain carrying the despatches and captured colours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell198&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=The naval history of Great Britain |page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic success of the small British force carrying the heavily defended island was rewarded handsomely. Brisbane was knighted, and the captains received swords, medals and vases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen188&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen|title=Battles of the British Navy|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wreck of ''Anson''==
[[File:Loss of the Anson.jpg|thumb|right|'Loss of the Anson Frigate, off Cornwall', in an 1808 depiction by William Elmes]]
''Anson'' was sent back to Britain shortly afterwards, and Lydiard rejoined his ship at [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy232&quot;/&gt; After a period refitting ''Anson'' was assigned to the Channel Fleet and ordered to support the blockade of [[Brest, France|Brest]] by patrolling off Black Rocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy232&quot;/&gt; She sailed from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] on 24 December, and reached Ile de Bas on 28 December. With a gale blowing up from the south west, Lydiard decided to return to port.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilly126&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilly|title=Narratives of Shipwrecks of the Royal Navy|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made for [[the Lizard]], but in the poor weather, came up on the wrong side and became trapped on a lee shore, with breakers ahead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilly126&quot;/&gt; ''Anson'' rolled heavily in  rough seas, having retained the spars from her days as a 64-gun ship after she had been razeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy232&quot;/&gt; Lydiard's only option was to anchor, but early on the morning of 29 December the rising storm caused the anchor cables to part and she was driven onto the shore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilly127&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilly|title=Narratives of Shipwrecks of the Royal Navy|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lydiard ordered the ship to be run onto a beach in the hope of saving as many lives as possible, and resolved to remain aboard to oversee the evacuation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy232&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell201&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=The naval history of Great Britain |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pounding surf prevented boats from being launched from the ship or the shore, and a number of the crew were swept away. Some managed to clamber along the fallen main-mast to the shore, while Lydiard clung to the wheel to encourage them on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell201&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilly128&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilly|title=Narratives of Shipwrecks of the Royal Navy|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyewitnesses recorded that Lydiard had exhausted himself with the effort of organising the evacuation and clinging to the wreck in the violence of the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilly128&quot;/&gt; He attempted to leave the ship, but became distracted by trying to help a boy. In doing so Lydiard was washed away and drowned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilly128&quot;/&gt; The ''Naval Chronicle''{{'}}s account of the wreck recorded that {{Quote|It was the captain's great wish to save the lives of the ship's company, and he was employed in directing them the whole of the time. He had placed himself by the wheel, holding the spokes, where he was exposed to the violence of the sea, which broke tremendously over him, and from continuing in this situation too long, wishing to see the people out of the ship, he became so weak, that, upon attempting to leave the ship himself, and being impeded by a boy who was in his way, and whom he endeavoured to assist, he was washed away and drowned.|''The Naval Chronicle'', volume 19, 1808, p. 453}}

A total of sixty of ''Anson''{{'}}s crew were lost, including her captain and her first-lieutenant. Lydiard's body was recovered and a funeral service was held at Falmouth, attended by Admiral [[Sir Charles Cotton, 5th Baronet|Sir Charles Cotton]] and large numbers of army and navy officers, as well as the local dignitaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy232&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell202&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=The naval history of Great Britain |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was later interred in the family vault at [[Haslemere]], [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell202&quot;/&gt;
