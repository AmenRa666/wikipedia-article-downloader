{{History of Hungary}}

The '''Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin''',{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=42}} also '''Hungarian conquest'''{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=191}} or '''Hungarian land-taking'''{{sfn|Tóth|1999|loc= note 2 on p. 23}} ({{lang-hu|honfoglalás}}: &quot;conquest of the homeland&quot;){{sfn|Roman|2003|p=145}} was a series of historical events ending with the settlement of the [[Hungarian people]] in [[Central Europe]] at the turn of the 9th and 10th&amp;nbsp;centuries. Before the arrival of the Hungarians, three early medieval powers, the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], [[East Francia]] and [[Great Moravia|Moravia]] had fought each other for control of the [[Carpathian Basin]]. They occasionally hired Hungarian horsemen as soldiers. Therefore, the Hungarians who dwelt on the [[Pontic steppes]] east of the Carpathians were familiar with their future homeland when their &quot;land-taking&quot; started.

The Hungarian conquest started in the context of a &quot;late or 'small' [[migration of peoples]]&quot;.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=42}} Contemporary sources attest that the Hungarians crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]] following a joint attack in 894 or 895 by the [[Pechenegs]] and [[Bulgarians]] against them. They first took control over the [[Great Hungarian Plain|lowlands east of the river Danube]] and attacked and occupied [[Pannonia]] (the region to the west of the river) in 900. They exploited internal conflicts in [[Great Moravia|Moravia]] and annihilated this state sometime between 902 and 906.

The Hungarians strengthened their control over the Carpathian Basin by defeating a [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] army in a [[Battle of Pressburg|battle fought at ''Brezalauspurc'']] on July 4, 907. They launched a [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|series of plundering raids]] between 899 and 955 and also targeted the [[Byzantine Empire]] between 943 and 971. However, they gradually settled in the Basin and established a Christian monarchy, the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of Hungary]] around 1000.

== Sources ==

=== Written sources ===

[[Byzantine literature|Byzantine authors]] were the first to record these events.{{sfn|Engel|2003|p=650}} The earliest work is Emperor [[Leo the Wise]]'s ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactics]]'', finished around 904, which recounts the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian Wars#Simeon I’s Imperial ambitions|Bulgarian-Byzantine war of 894–896]], a military conflict directly preceding the Hungarians' departure from the [[Pontic steppes]].{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=53}} Nearly contemporary narration{{sfn|Engel|2003|p=650}} can be read in the ''Continuation of the [[George Hamartolos#Chronicle|Chronicle by George the Monk]]''.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=55}} However, ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (&quot;On Governing the Empire&quot;) provides the most detailed account.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|pp=51–52}} It was compiled under the auspices of Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] in 951 or 952.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=54}}

[[File:Képes Krónika 1360.jpg|190px|thumb|left|alt=First page of the Illuminated Chronicle|First page of the ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'']]

Works written by clergymen in the [[Treaty of Verdun|successor states]] of the [[Carolingian Empire]]  narrate events closely connected to the conquest.{{sfn|Engel|2003|p=650}} The ''[[Annals of Fulda]]'' which ends in 901 is the earliest among them.{{sfn|Engel|2003|p=652}} A letter from Archbishop [[Dietmar I, Archbishop of Salzburg|Theotmar of Salzburg]] to [[Pope John IX]] in 900 also refers to the conquering Hungarians, but it is often regarded as a fake.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=56}} Abbot [[Regino of Prüm]] who compiled his ''[[Regino of Prüm#Works#Chronicon|World Chronicle]]'' around 908{{sfn|Engel|2003|p=653}} sums up his knowledge on the Hungarians in a sole entry under the year 889.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=56}} Another valuable source is Bishop [[Liutprand of Cremona]]'s ''Antapodosis'' (&quot;Retribution&quot;) from around 960.{{sfn|Engel|2003|p=654}}{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=57}} [[Johannes Aventinus|Aventinus]], a 16th-century historian provides information not known from other works,{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=176}} which suggests that he used now-lost sources.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=176}}{{sfn|Macartney|1953|p=16}} However, his reliability is suspect.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=91}}

An [[Old Church Slavonic]] compilation of ''Lives'' of saints preserved an eyewitness account on the Bulgarian-Byzantine war of 894–896.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=185}}{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=61}} The first{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=193}} ''[[Hagiography|Life]]'' of [[Saint Naum]], written around 924, contains nearly contemporary information on the [[Great Moravia#History#Decline and fall|fall of Moravia]] caused by Hungarian invasions, although its earliest extant copy is from the 15th century.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=61}} Similarly late [[manuscript]]s (the oldest of which was written in the 14th century) offer the text of the ''[[Russian Primary Chronicle]]'', a historical work completed in 1113.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=62}} It provides information based on earlier Byzantine and [[Great Moravia#Culture#Literature|Moravian]]{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=52}} sources.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=62}}

The Hungarians themselves initially preserved the memory of the major events in &quot;the form of folk songs and ballads&quot; ([[Carlile Aylmer Macartney|C. A. Macartney]]).{{sfn|Macartney|1953|p=1}} The earliest local chronicle was compiled in the late 11th&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=24}} It exists now in more than one variant, its original version several times extended and rewritten during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=58}}{{sfn|Szakács|2006|p=150}} For instance, the 14th-century ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'' contains texts from the 11th-century chronicle.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=58}}{{sfn|Buranbaeva|Mladineo|2011|p=113}}

An anonymous author's ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' (&quot;Deeds of the Hungarians&quot;), written before 1200,{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=20}} is the earliest extant local chronicle.{{sfn|Buranbaeva|Mladineo|2011|p=113}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=350}} However, this &quot;most misleading&quot; example &quot;of all the early Hungarian texts&quot; (C. A. Macartney) contains much information that cannot be confirmed based on contemporaneous sources.{{sfn|Macartney|1953|p=59}} Around 1283 [[Simon of Kéza]], a priest at the Hungarian royal court wrote the next surviving chronicle.{{sfn|Buranbaeva|Mladineo|2011|p=113}} He claims that the Hungarians were closely related to the [[Huns]], earlier conquerors of the Carpathian Basin.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=71}} Accordingly, in his narration, the Hungarian invasion is in fact a second conquest of the same territory by the same people.{{sfn|Buranbaeva|Mladineo|2011|p=113}}

=== Archaeology ===
[[File:Bijelo brdo culture01.png|thumb|250px|Map showing the basic territory of Bijelo Brdo culture (10th-12th century), according to the book of Russian archaeologist Valentin Vasilyevich Sedov. By this view, the area of the village of Bijelo Brdo itself is excluded from this territory.]]
Graves of the first generations of the conquering Hungarians were identified in the Carpathian Basin, but fewer than ten definitely Hungarian cemeteries have been unearthed in the Pontic steppes.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|pp=117–118., 134}} Most Hungarian cemeteries include 25 or 30 [[inhumation]] graves, but isolated burials were common.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=17}} Adult males (and sometimes women and children){{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=139}} were buried together with either parts of their horses or with [[horse harness|harness]] and other objects symbolizing a horse.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=16}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=39}} The graves also yielded decorated silver belts, [[sabretache]]s furnished with metal plates, pear-shaped stirrups and other metal works.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|pp=133–134}} Many of these objects had close analogues in the contemporaneous multiethnic &quot;[[Saltovo-Mayaki]] culture&quot;{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=139}} of the Pontic steppes.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=24}} Most cemeteries from the turn of the 9th and 10th&amp;nbsp;centuries are concentrated in the Upper Tisza region and in the plains along the rivers [[Rába]] and [[Váh|Vág]], for instance, at [[Tarcal]], [[Tiszabezdéd]], [[Naszvad]] (Nesvady, [[Slovakia]]) and [[Gyömöre]],{{sfn|Spinei|2003|pp=55., 58}} but early small cemeteries were also unearthed at [[Kolozsvár]] (Cluj-Napoca), [[Marosgombás]] (Gâmbaș) and other Transylvanian sites.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|pp=108–109}}

[[File:Дністер. село Дзвенигород.jpg|190px|thumb|right|alt=Dniester River|River [[Dniester]] at Dzvenyhorod ([[Borshchiv Raion]], [[Ukraine]])]]

The ''Continuation of the Chronicle by [[George Hamartolos|George the Monk]]'' contains the earliest certain{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=39}} reference to the Hungarians.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=10}} It states that Hungarian warriors intervened in a [[Byzantine–Bulgarian wars#Brief war with Theophilos|conflict between the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarians]] on the latter's behalf in the [[Lower Danube]] region in 836 or 837.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=123}} The first known Hungarian raid in Central Europe was recorded in the ''[[Annals of St. Bertin]]''.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=50}} It writes of &quot;enemies, called Hungarians, hitherto unknown&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of St-Bertin'' (year 862), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; who ravaged King [[Louis the German]]'s realm in 862.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=50}} Vajay, [[Victor Spinei]] and other historians argue that [[Rastislav of Moravia]], at war with Louis the German, hired Hungarians to invade [[East Francia]].{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=50}}{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=237}} Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg clearly states in his letter of around 900 that the [[Great Moravia#People|Moravians]] often allied with the Hungarians against the [[Germans]].{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=237}}

{{Quote|''For many years'' [the Moravians] ''have in fact perpetrated the very crime of which they have only once falsely accused us. They themselves have taken in a large number of Hungarians and have shaved their own heads according to their heathen customs and they have sent them against our Christians, overcoming them, leading some away as captives, killing others, while still others, imprisoned, perished of hunger and thirst.''|Letter of Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg and his suffragans to [[Pope John IX]] from around 900{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=338}}}}

Porphyrogenitus mentions that the Hungarians dwelled in a territory that they called ''&quot;[[Etelköz|Atelkouzou]]&quot;'' until their invasion across the Carpathians.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|pp=148., 156}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|pp=42–43}}&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 38), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that it was located in the territory where the rivers ''Barouch'', ''Koubou'', ''Troullos'', ''Broutos'' and ''Seretos''&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 40), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; run.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=156}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=44}} Although the identification of the first two rivers with the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] and the [[Southern Bug]] is not unanimously accepted, the last three names without doubt refer to the rivers [[Dniester]], [[Prut]] and [[Siret River|Siret]].{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=44}} In the wider region, at Subotsi on the river Adiamka, three graves (one of them belonging to a male buried with the skull and legs of his horse) are attributed to pre-conquest Hungarians.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=44}} However, these tombs may date to the 10th century.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=124}}

[[File:HetVezer-ChroniconPictum.jpg|190px|thumb|left|alt=Heads of the seven tribes|Heads of the [[Magyar tribes|seven Hungarian tribes]] depicted in the ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'']]

The Hungarians were organized into [[Magyar tribes|seven tribes]] that formed a confederation.{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=10}} Constantine Porphyrogenitus mentions this number.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|pp=116–117}} Anonymous seems to have preserved the Hungarian ''&quot;Hetumoger&quot;'' (&quot;Seven Hungarians&quot;) denomination of the tribal confederation, although he writes of &quot;seven leading persons&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 1.), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; jointly bearing this name instead of a political organization.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|pp=116–117}}

The ''Hetumoger'' confederation was strengthened by the arrival of the [[Kabars]],{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=10}} who (according to Constantine) joined the Hungarians following their unsuccessful riot against the [[Khazar Khaganate]].{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=51}} The Hungarians and the Kabars are mentioned in the longer version of the ''[[Annals of Salzburg]]'',{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=329}} which relates that the Hungarians fought around [[Vienna]], while the Kabars fought nearby at ''Culmite'' in 881.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|pp=237–238}} Madgearu proposes that Kavar groups were already settled in the Tisza plain within the Carpathian Basin around 881, which may have given rise to the anachronistic reference to [[Cumans]] in the ''Gesta Hungarorum'' at the time of the Hungarian conquest.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=34., 37}}

The ''Hetumoger'' confederation was under a dual leadership, according to [[Ibn Rusta]] and [[Gardizi]] (two Muslim scholars from the 10th and 11th&amp;nbsp;centuries, respectively, whose [[Muslim geography|geographical books]] preserved texts from an earlier work written by [[Abu Abdallah al-Jayhani]] from [[Bukhara]]).{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|pp=69–72}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|pp=101–104}} The Hungarians' nominal or [[Sacred king|sacred leader]] was styled ''[[kende]]'', while their military commander bore the title ''[[Gyula (title)|gyula]]''.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|pp=343., 347}} The same authors add that the ''gyula'' commanded an army of 20,000 horsemen,{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=42}} but the reliability of this number is uncertain.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|pp=343., 353}}

Regino of Prüm and other contemporary authors portray the 9th-century Hungarians as nomadic warriors.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=15}} Emperor Leo the Wise underlines the importance of horses to their military tactics.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=15–16}} Analysis of horse skulls found in Hungarian warriors graves has not revealed any significant difference between these horses and Western breeds.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=20}} Regino of Prüm states that the Hungarians knew &quot;nothing about fighting hand-to-hand in formation or taking besieged cities&quot;,&lt;ref name='Regino_of_Prum_205'&gt;''The'' Chronicle ''of Regino of Prüm'' (year 889), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; but he underlines their [[archery]] skills.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=19}} Remains indicate that [[composite bow]]s were the Hungarians' most important weapons.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=358}} In addition, slightly curved [[sabre]]s were unearthed in many warrior tombs from the period.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=136}} Regino of Prüm noted the Hungarians' preference for deceptions such as apparent retreat in battle.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=19}} Contemporaneous writers also recounted their viciousness, represented by the slaughter of adult males in settlement raids.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=16}}

{{Quote|[The Hungarians] ''are armed with swords, body armor, bows and lances. Thus, in battles most of them bear double arms, carrying the lances high on their shoulders and holding the bows in their hands. They make use of both as need requires, but when pursued they use their bows to great advantage. Not only do they wear armor themselves, but the horses of their illustrious men are covered in front with iron or quilted material. They devote a great deal of attention and training to archery on horse-back. A huge herd of horses, ponies and mares, follows them, to provide both food and milk and, at the same time, to give the impression of a multitude.''|[[Leo the Wise]]: ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactics]]''&lt;ref&gt;''The Taktika of Leo VI'' (18.47–50), pp. 455–457.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Main article|History of Hungary before the Hungarians}}

=== Peoples ===
Based on the extant Hungarian chronicles, it is clear that more than one (occasionally extended) list existed of the peoples inhabiting the Carpathian Basin at the time of the Hungarian landtaking.{{sfn|Macartney|1953|pp=64–65, 70}} Anonymous, for instance, first writes of the &quot;Slavs, Bulgarians, [[Vlachs]] and the [[shepherds of the Romans]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 9.), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; as inhabiting the territory,{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=45}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=15}} but later he refers to &quot;a people called Kozar&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 11.), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[Székelys]].{{sfn|Macartney|1953|pp=64–65, 70}} Similarly, Simon of Kéza first lists the &quot;Slavs, [[Greeks]], Germans, Moravians and Vlachs&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Simon of Kéza: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 2.23), pp. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=46–47}} but later adds that the Székelys also lived in the territory.{{sfn|Macartney|1953|p=103}} According to C. A. Macartney, those lists were based on multiple sources and do not document the real ethnic conditions of the Carpathian Basin around 900.{{sfn|Macartney|1953|pp=70, 80}} According to Ioan-Aurel Pop, Simon of Kéza listed the peoples who inhabited the lands that the Hungarian conquered and the nearby territories.{{sfn|Pop|2013|p=63}}

The Hungarians adopted the ancient ([[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Dacian language|Dacian]] or [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) names of the longest rivers in the Carpathian Basin from a [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking]] population.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=95}} For instance, the Hungarian names of the rivers [[Danube]] ''(Duna)'', [[Drava|Dráva]], [[Hron|Garam]], [[Mureș River|Maros]], [[Olt River|Olt]], [[Sava|Száva]], [[Tisza]] and [[Váh|Vág]] were borrowed from Slavs.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=95}}{{sfn|Kiss|1983|pp=187., 190., 233., 408., 481., 532., 599., 643}} The Hungarians also adopted a great number of [[hydronym]]s of Slavic origin, including [[Lake Balaton|Balaton]] (&quot;swamp&quot;), [[Bistrița River (Someș)|Beszterce]] (&quot;swift river&quot;), [[Tur River|Túr]] (&quot;[[aurochs]]' stream&quot;) and [[Zagyva]] (&quot;sooty river&quot;).{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=95}}{{sfn|Kiss|1983|pp=80., 108., 661., 712}}{{sfn|Makkai|1994}} [[Place name]]s of Slavic origin abound across the Carpathian Basin.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=96}} For instance, [[Csongrád]] (&quot;black fortress&quot;), [[Nógrád]] (&quot;new fortress&quot;), [[Visegrád]] (&quot;citadel&quot;) and other early medieval fortresses bore a Slavic name, while the name of [[Keszthely]] preserved the [[Latin]] word for fortress ''(castellum)'' with Slavic mediation.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=96}}{{sfn|Kiss|1983|pp=166–167., 331., 465., 697}}

Besides the Slavs, the presence of a German-speaking population can be demonstrated based on [[toponyms]].{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=98}} For instance, the Hungarians adopted the Germanized form of the name of the river Vulka (whose name is of Slavic origin) and the document known as the ''[[Conversion of the Bavarians and the Carantanians]]'' from around 870 lists Germanic place names in Pannonia, including ''Salapiugin'' (&quot;bend of the [[Zala (river)|Zala]]&quot;) and ''[[Zalavár|Mosaburc]]'' (&quot;fortress in the marshes&quot;).{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=96., 98}} Finally, the name of the [[Bârsa River (Olt)|Barca]], [[Baraolt River|Barót]] and other rivers could be either Turkic{{sfn|Makkai|1994}} or Slavic.{{sfn|Kiss|1983|pp=91–92}}

According to Béla Miklós Szőke's theory, the detailed description of the Magyars by western contemporary sources and the immediate Hungarian intervention in local wars give the presumption that the Hungarians had already lived on the eastern territories of the [[Carpathian Basin]] since the middle of the 9th century.&lt;ref name='Szoke'&gt;{{cite web |author= Béla Miklós Szőke |title= A Kárpát-medence a Karoling-korban és a magyar honfoglalás (Tudomány és hagyományőrzés konferencia) |publisher=MTA Bölcsészettudományi Kutatóközpont |accessdate=7 December 2013 |date=17 April 2013 |language=Hungarian |url=http://www.btk.mta.hu/images/02_Sz%C5%91ke_B%C3%A9la_Mikl%C3%B3s-ujabb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the right location of early Hungarian settlements, the Arabic geographer al-Jayhani (only snippets of his work survived in other Muslim authors' papers){{sfn|Engel|2001|p=8}} in the 870s placed the Hungarians between [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and [[Danube]] rivers.&lt;ref name='Szoke'/&gt; Szőke identifies al-Jayhani's Danube with the middle Danube region, as opposed to the previously assumed lower Danube region, because following al-Jayhani's description the Christian [[Moravians (tribe)|Moravians]] were the western neighbors of the Magyars.&lt;ref name='Szoke'/&gt;

The Carpathian Basin was controlled from the 560s by the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]],{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=262}} a [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] people.{{sfn|Makkai|1994|pp=6–7}} Upon their arrival in the region, they imposed their authority over the [[Gepids]] who had dominated the territories east of the river [[Tisza]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=2}} However, the Gepids survived up until the second half of the 9th century, according to a reference in the ''Conversion of the Bavarians and the Carantanians'' to their groups dwelling in [[Duchy of Lower Pannonia|Lower Pannonia]] around 870.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=98}}

The Avars initially were nomadic horsemen, but both large cemeteries used by three or four generations and a growing number of settlements attest to their adoption of a sedentary (non-nomadic) way of life from the 8th century.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|pp=31–32}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=92}} The [[Avar Khaganate#History#Collapse|Avars' power was destroyed]] between 791 and 795 by [[Charlemagne]],{{sfn|Spiesz|Caplovic|Bolchazy|2006|p=19}} who occupied Transdanubia and attached it to his empire.{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=7}} Archaeological investigation of early medieval rural settlements at [[Balatonmagyaród]], [[Nemeskér]] and other places in Transdanubia demonstrate that their main features did not change with the fall of the [[Avar Khaganate]].{{sfn|Szőke|2003|p=314}} New settlements appeared in the former borderlands with cemeteries characterized by objects with clear analogues in contemporary Bavaria, Bulgaria, [[Croatia]], Moravia and other faraway territories.{{sfn|Szőke|2003|p=314}} A manor defended by timber walls (similar to noble courts of other parts of the Carolingian Empire) was unearthed at [[Zalaszabar]].{{sfn|Szőke|2003|p=314}}

Avar groups who remained under the rule of their ''[[khagan]]'' were frequently attacked by [[Early Slavs|Slav]] warriors.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|pp=57–58}} Therefore, the ''khagan'' asked Charlemagne to let his people settle in the region between [[Szombathely]] and [[Petronell-Carnuntum|Petronell]] in Pannonia.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=57}} His petition was accepted in 805.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=57}} The ''Conversion of the Bavarians and the Carantanians'' lists the Avars among the peoples under the ecclesiastic jurisdiction of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Salzburg]] around 870.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=264}} According to Pohl, it &quot;simply proved impossible to keep up an Avar identity after Avar institutions and the high claims of their tradition had failed.&quot;{{sfn|Pohl|1998|p=19}} The growing number of archaeological evidence in [[Transdanubia]] also presumes Avar population in the Carpathian Basin at the eve of the 10th&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Olajos|2001|p=55}} Archaeological findings suggesting that there is a substantial late Avar presence on the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], however it is difficult to determine their proper chronology.{{sfn|Olajos|2001|p=55}}

A charter issued in 860 by King Louis the German for the Mattsee Abbey may well attest that the [[Onogurs]] (another people of Turkic origin) were also present in the territory.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=285-286}} The charter refers to the &quot;[[Marches]] of the Wangars&quot; ''(marcha uuangariourum)'' situated in the westernmost regions of the Carpathian Basin.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=97-98}} The ''Wangar'' denomination seems to reflect the Slavic form of the Onogurs' [[ethnonym]].{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=285-286}}

[[File:Zalavár - Convent.jpg|thumb|left|190px|alt=Church at Zalavár|Ruins of the 9th-century church at [[Zalavár]]]]
The territories attached to the Frankish Empire were initially governed by royal officers and local chieftains.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|pp=72–73}} A Slavic prince named [[Pribina]] received large estates along the river [[Zala (river)|Zala]] around 840.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=243}} He promoted the colonization of his lands,{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=95}} and also erected [[Zalavár|Mosaburg]], a fortress in the marshes.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=243}} Initially defended by timber walls, this &quot;castle complex&quot;{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=133}} (András Róna-Tas) became an administrative center. It was strengthened by [[drystone]] walls at the end of the century. Four churches surrounded by cemeteries were unearthed in and around the settlement. At least one of them continued to be used up to the 11th&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Szőke|2003|p=315}}

Pribina died fighting the Moravians in 861, and his son, [[Kocel]] inherited his estates.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=125}} The latter was succeeded around 876 by [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]], a [[natural son]] of [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], king of East Francia.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=202}} Under his rule, Moravian troops interved into the conflict known as the &quot;[[Wilhelminer War]]&quot; and &quot;laid waste from the [[Rába|Raab]] eastward&quot;, between 882 and 884, according to the ''Annals of Fulda''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Fulda'' (year 884), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|pp=208–213}}

Moravia emerged in the 820s{{sfn|Spiesz|Caplovic|Bolchazy|2006|p=20}} under its first known ruler, [[Mojmir I]].{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=243}} His successor, Rastislav, developed Moravia's military strength. He promoted the proselytizing activities of the Byzantine brothers, [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Constantine and Methodius]] in an attempt to seek independence from East Francia.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=243}}{{sfn|Spiesz|Caplovic|Bolchazy|2006|pp=21–22}} Moravia reached its &quot;peak of importance&quot; under [[Svatopluk I]]{{sfn|Kontler|1999|pp=31–33}} (870–894) who expanded its frontiers in all directions.{{sfn|Spiesz|Caplovic|Bolchazy|2006|pp=24–25}}

Moravia's core territory is located in the regions on the [[Morava (river)|northern Morava river]], in the territory of present-day [[Czech Republic]] and Slovakia.{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp=126–127}} However, Constantine Porphyrogenitus places &quot;great Moravia, the unbaptized&quot;&lt;ref name='ConstantineVII_177'&gt;''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 40), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; somewhere in the regions beyond [[Belgrade]] and [[Sirmium]] ([[Sremska Mitrovica]], [[Serbia]]).{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=180}} His report supported [[Great Moravia#Territory#Alternative theories|further theories on Moravia's location]].{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|pp=180–181}} For instance, Kristó and Senga propose the existence of two Moravias (one in the north and other one in the south),{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=181}} while Boba, Bowlus and Eggers argue that Moravia's core territory is in the region of the [[Great Morava|southern Morava river]], in present-day Serbia.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=127}} The existence of a southern Moravian realm is not supported by artifacts, while strongholds unearthed at [[Mikulcice]], [[Breclav#History#Pohansko|Pohansko]] and other areas to the north of the [[Middle Danube]] point at the existence of a power center in those regions.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=130}}

In addition to East Francia and Moravia, the first Bulgarian Empire was the third power deeply involved in the Carpathian Basin in the 9th century.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=4}} A late 10th-century Byzantine lexicon known as ''[[Suda]]'' adds that [[Krum of Bulgaria]] attacked the Avars from the southeast around 803.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=149}}  The ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' narrates that the [[Abodrites]] inhabiting &quot;[[Dacia]] on the Danube&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Frankish Annals'' (year 824), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; (most probably along the lower courses of the river Tisza) sought the assistance of the [[Franks]] against the Bulgars in 824.{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp=157–159}} Bulgarian troops also invaded Pannonia, &quot;expelled the Slavic chieftains and appointed Bulgar governors instead&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Frankish Annals'' (year 827), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; in 827.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=107}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=158}} An inscription at [[Provadia]] refers to a Bulgarian military leader named Onegavonais drowning in the Tisza around the same time.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=159}} The emerging power of Moravia brought about a rapprochement between Bulgaria and East Francia in the 860s.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=118}} For instance, King Arnulf of East Francia sent an embassy to the Bulgarians in 892 in order &quot;to renew the former peace and to ask that they should not sell salt to the Moravians&quot;.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|pp=224–225., 229}} The latter request suggests that the route from the salt mines of the [[Eastern Carpathians]] to Moravia was controlled around that time by the Bulgarians.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=229}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Fulda'' (year 892), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anonymous author of the ''Gesta Hungarorum'', instead of Svatopluk I of Moravia and other rulers known from contemporary sources, writes of personalities and polities that are not mentioned by chroniclers working at the end of the 9th&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=11}} For instance, he refers to [[Menumorut]] residing in the castle of [[Biharia|Bihar]] (Biharia, [[Romania]]), to Zobor &quot;duke of [[Nitra]] by the grace of the Duke of the [[Czechs]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 35.), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Gelou]] &quot;a certain [[Vlach]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 24.), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; ruling over [[Transylvania]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=11}} Although early medieval fortresses were unearthed at Bihar and other places east of the Tisza, none of them definitively date to the 9th century.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=148–149}} For instance, in the case of Doboka (Dăbâca), two pairs of bell-shaped [[pendant]]s with analogues in sites in Austria, Bulgaria and Poland have been unearthed, but Florin Curta dates them to the 9th&amp;nbsp;century, while Alexandru Madgearu to the period between 975 and 1050.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=115}}{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=148}}

== The Hungarian conquest ==

=== Prelude (892–c. 895) ===

[[File:Honfoglalas.gif|thumb|alt=The Hungarian Conquest|The Hungarian Land-taking]]

Three main theories attempt to explain the reasons for the &quot;Hungarian land-taking&quot;.{{sfn|Tóth|1998|p=169}} One argues that it was an intended military operation, prearranged following previous raids, with the express purpose of occupying a new homeland.{{sfn|Tóth|1998|p=169}} This view (represented, for instance, by Bakay and Padányi) mainly follows the narration of Anonymous and later Hungarian chronicles.{{sfn|Tóth|1998|pp=169., 230–231}} The opposite view maintains that a joint attack by the Pechenegs and the Bulgarians forced the Hungarians' hand.{{sfn|Tóth|1998|p= 170}} Kristó, Tóth and the theory's other followers refer to the unanimous testimony provided by the ''Annals of Fulda'', Regino of Prüm and Porphyrogenitus on the connection between the Hungarians' conflict with the Bulgar-Pecheneg coalition and their withdrawal from the Pontic steppes.{{sfn|Tóth|1998|pp=170., 226., 234}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|pp=181–182}} An intermediate theory proposes that the Hungarians had for decades been considering a westward move when the Bulgarian-Pecheneg attack accelerated their decision to leave the Pontic steppes.{{sfn|Tóth|1998|pp=169–170}} For instance Róna-Tas argues, &quot;[the] fact that, despite a series of unfortunate events, the Magyars managed to keep their heads above water goes to show that they were indeed ready to move on&quot; when the Pechenegs attacked them.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=336}}

In fact, following a break of eleven years, the Hungarians returned to the Carpathian Basin in 892.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=51}} They came to assist Arnulf of East Francia against Svatopluk I of Moravia.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=51}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=175}} [[Widukind of Corvey]] and Liutprand of Cremona condemned the Frankish monarch for destroying the defense lines built along the empire's borders, because this also enabled the Hungarians to attack East Francia within a decade.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=241}}

{{Quote|Meanwhile Arnulf (…) could not overcome Sviatopolk, duke of the Moravians (…); and – alas! – having dismantled those very well fortified barriers which (…) are called &quot;closures&quot; by the populace. Arnulf summoned to his aid the nation of the Hungarians, greedy, rash, ignorant of almighty God but well versed in every crime, avid only for murder and plunder (…).|[[Liutprand of Cremona]]: ''Retribution''&lt;ref&gt;''Liudprand of Cremona: Retribution'' (1.13), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A late source,{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=91}} Aventinus adds that [[Kurszán]] ''(Cusala)'', &quot;king of the Hungarians&quot; stipulated that his people would only fight the Moravians if they received the lands they were to occupy.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=175}} Accordingly, Aventinus continues, the Hungarians took possession of &quot;both Dacias on this side and beyond&quot; the Tisza east of the rivers Danube and Garam already in 893.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=175}} Indeed, the Hungarian chronicles unanimously state that the [[Székelys]] had already been present in the Carpathian Basin when the Hungarians moved in.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=107}} Kristó argues that Aventinus and the Hungarian historical tradition together point at an early occupation of the eastern territories of the Carpathian Basin by auxiliary troops of the Hungarian tribal confederation.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=107}}

The ''Annals of Fulda'' narrates under the year 894 that the Hungarians crossed the Danube into Pannonia where they &quot;killed men and old women outright and carried off the young women alone with them like cattle to satisfy their lusts and reduced the whole&quot; province &quot;to desert&quot;.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=240}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Fulda'' (year 894), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the annalist writes of this Hungarian attack after the passage narrating Svatopluk I's death,{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=240}} Györffy, Kristó,{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=177}} Róna-Tas{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=332}} and other historians suppose that the Hungarians invaded Pannonia in alliance with the Moravian monarch.{{sfn|Tóth|1998|pp=149–150}} They argue that the &quot;Legend of the White Horse&quot; in the Hungarian chronicles preserved the memory of a treaty the Hungarians concluded with Svatopluk I according to pagan customs.{{sfn|Tóth|1998|p= 150}} The legend narrates that the Hungarians purchased their future homeland in the Carpathian Basin from Svatopluk for a white horse harnessed with gilded [[saddle]] and reins.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=177}}

{{Quote|Then {{bracket|[[Kurszán|Kusid]]}} came to the leader of the region who reigned after Attila and whose name was Zuatapolug, and saluted him in the name of his people [...]. On hearing this, Zuatapolug rejoiced greatly, for he thought that they were peasant people who would come and till his land; and so he dismissed the messenger graciously. [...] Then by a common resolve [the Hungarians] despatched the same messenger again to the said leader and sent to him for his land a big horse with a golden saddle adorned with the gold of Arabia and a golden [[bridle]]. Seeing it, the leader rejoiced all the more, thinking that they were sending gifts of homage in return for land. When therefore the messenger asked of him land, grass and water, he replied with a smile, &quot;In return for the gift let them have as much as they desire.&quot; [...] Then [the Hungarians] sent another messenger to the leader and this was the message which he delivered: &quot;Arpad and his people say to you that you may no longer stay upon the land which they bought of you, for with the horse they bought your earth, with the bridle the grass, and with the saddle the water. And you, in your need and avarice, made to them a grant of land, grass and water.&quot; When this message was delivered to the leader, he said with a smile: &quot;Let them kill the horse with a wooden [[mallet]], and throw the bridle on the field, and throw the golden saddle into the water of the Danube.&quot; To which the messenger replied: &quot;And what loss will that be to them, lord? If you kill the horse, you will give food for their dogs; if you throw the bridle on the field, their men will find the gold of the bridle when they mow the hay; if you throw the saddle into the Danube, their fishermen will lay out the gold of the saddle upon the bank and carry it home. If they have earth, grass and water, they have all.&quot;|''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]''&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 28), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ismail Samani|Ismail Ibn Ahmed]], the emir of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] raided &quot;the land of the Turks&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The History of al-Tabari'' (38:2138), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Karluks]]) in 893. Later he caused a new movement of peoples who one by one invaded the lands of their western neighbors in the [[Eurasian steppes]].{{sfn|Tóth|1998|p= 178}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=182}} [[Al-Masudi]] clearly connected the westward movement of the Pechenegs and the Hungarians to previous fights between the Karluks, [[Ouzes]] and [[Kimeks]].{{sfn|Tóth|1998|pp=178–179}} Porphyrogenitus writes of a joint attack by the [[Khazars]] and Ouzes that compelled the Pechenegs to cross the [[Volga River]] sometime between 893 and 902{{sfn|Tóth|1998|pp=179–180}} (most probably around 894).{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=182}}

The relationship between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire sharpened in 894, because Emperor [[Leo the Wise]] forced the Bulgarian merchants to leave [[Constantinople]] and settle in [[Thessaloniki]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=137}} Subsequently, Tzar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] invaded Byzantine territories{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=178}} and defeated a small imperial troop.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=138}} The Byzantines approached the Hungarians to hire them to fight the Bulgarians.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=178}} Nicetas Sclerus, the Byzantine envoy, concluded a treaty with their leaders, [[Árpád]] and Kurszán ''(Kusan)''{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=183}} and Byzantine ships transferred Hungarian warriors across the Lower Danube.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=178}} The Hungarians invaded Bulgaria, forced Tzar Simeon to flee to the fortress of [[Dristra]] (now Silistra, Bulgaria) and plundered [[Preslav]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=138}} An interpolation in Porphyrogenitus's work states that the Hungarians had a prince named &quot;[[Liüntika|Liountikas]], son of Arpad&quot;&lt;ref name='ConstantineVII_177'/&gt; at that time, which suggests that he was the commander of the army, but he might have been mentioned in the war context by chance.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=186}}

Simultaneously with the Hungarian attack from the north, the Byzantines invaded Bulgaria from the south. Tzar Simeon sent envoys to the Byzantine Empire to propose a truce. At the same time, he sent an embassy to the Pechenegs to incite them against the Hungarians.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=138}} He succeeded and the Pechenegs broke into Hungarian territories from the east, forcing the Hungarian warriors to withdraw from Bulgaria.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=139}} The Bulgarians, according to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, attacked and [[Battle of Southern Buh|routed the Hungarians]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=178}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=12}}

The Pechenegs destroyed the Hungarians' dwelling places.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=178}} Those who survived the double attack left the Pontic steppes and crossed the Carpathians in search of a new homeland.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=178}} The memory of the destruction brought by the Pechenegs seems to have been preserved by the Hungarians.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=188}} The Hungarian name of the Pechenegs ''(besenyő)'' corresponds to the old Hungarian word for eagle ''(bese)''. Thus the 14th-century Hungarian chronicles' story of eagles compelling the Hungarians' ancestors to cross the Carpathians most probably refers to the Pechenegs' attack.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=188}}

{{Quote|The Hungarians were (…) driven from their home (…) by a neighboring people called the Petchenegs, because they were superior to them in strength and number and because (…) their own country was not sufficient to accommodate their swelling numbers. After they had been forced to flee by the violence of the Petchenegs, they said goodbye to their homeland and set out to look for lands where they could live and establish settlements.|[[Regino of Prüm]]: ''Chronicle''&lt;ref&gt;''The'' Chronicle ''of Regino of Prüm'' (year 889), pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', [[Álmos, Grand Prince of the Magyars|Álmos]], Árpád's father &quot;could not enter [[Pannonia]], for he was killed in Erdelw&quot;.&lt;ref name='Illuminated_Chronicle_98'/&gt;{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=191}} The episode implies that Álmos was the ''kende'', the sacred ruler of the Hungarians, at the time of their destruction by the Pechenegs, which caused his sacrifice.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|pp=191–192}} If his death was in fact the consequence of a [[ritual murder]], his fate was similar to the Khazar ''khagans'' who were executed, according to [[Ibn Fadlan]] and al-Masudi, in case of disasters affecting their whole people.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=191}}

=== Second phase (900–902) ===

The emperor's death released the Hungarians from their alliance with East Francia.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=68}} On their way back from Italy they expanded their rule over Pannonia.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=69}} Furthermore, according to [[Liutprand of Cremona]], the Hungarians &quot;claimed for themselves the nation of the Moravians, which King Arnulf had subdued with the aid of their might&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Liudprand of Cremona: Retribution'' (2.2), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; at the coronation of Arnulf's son, [[Louis the Child]] in 900.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=200}} The ''Annals of [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]]'' relates that the Hungarians defeated the Moravians after their withdrawal from Italy.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=246}} Thereafter the Hungarians and the Moravians made an alliance and jointly invaded Bavaria, according to [[Johannes Aventinus|Aventinus]].{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=199}} However, the contemporary ''[[Annales Fuldenses|Annals of Fulda]]'' only refers to Hungarians reaching the river [[Enns (river)|Enns]].{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=247}}

One of the Hungarian contingents crossed the Danube and plundered the territories on the river's north bank, but [[Luitpold, Margrave of Bavaria]] gathered troops and routed them between [[Passau]] and [[Krems an der Donau]]{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|pp=247–248}} on November 20, 900.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=199}} He had a strong fortress erected against them on the Enns.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=248}} Nevertheless, the Hungarians became the masters of the Carpathian Basin by the occupation of Pannonia.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=199}} The ''Russian Primary Chronicle'' may also reflect the memory of this event{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=200}} when relating how the Hungarians expelled the ''&quot;Volokhi&quot;'' who had earlier subjugated the Slavs' homeland in Pannonia.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=51}} These ''Volokhi'', however, have also been associated either with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] or with the Vlachs ([[Romanians]]), for instance by Cross&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Primary Chronicle'' (1953, note 29 on p. 235)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Spinei|Spinei]],{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=73}} respectively.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=52}}

{{Quote|Over a long period the Slavs settled beside the Danube, where the Hungarian and Bulgarian lands now lie. From among these Slavs, parties scattered throughout the country and were known by appropriate names, according to the places where they settled. (...) The [Hungarians] passed by [[Kiev]] over the hill now called Hungarian and on arriving at the Dnieper, they pitched camp. They were nomads like the [[Cumans|Polovcians]]. Coming out of the east, they struggled across the [[Carpathian Mountains|great mountains]] and began to fight against the neighboring [Volokhi]{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=51}} and Slavs. For the Slavs had settled there first, but the [Volokhi] had seized the territory of the Slavs. The [Hungarians] subsequently expelled the [Volokhi], took their land and settled among the Slavs, whom they reduced to submission. From that time the territory was called Hungarian.|''[[Russian Primary Chronicle]]''&lt;ref&gt;''The Russian Primary Chronicle'' (Introduction and years 888–898), pp. 52–53., 62.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

King Louis the Child held a meeting at [[Regensburg]] in 901 to introduce further measures against the Hungarians.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=248}} Moravian envoys proposed a peace between Moravia and East Francia, because the Hungarians had in the meantime plundered their country.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=248}} A Hungarian army invading [[March of Carinthia|Carinthia]] was defeated{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|pp=248–250}} in April and Aventinus describes a defeat of the Hungarians by Margrave Luitpold at the river [[Fischa]] in the same year.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=142}}

=== Consolidation (902–907) ===

[[File:Ducove hradisko 4.JPG|190px|thumb|right|alt=Ruins of a Moravian fortress|Ruins of the [[Great Moravia|Moravian]] fortress at [[Ducové]] ([[Slovakia]])]]

The date when Moravia ceased to exist is uncertain, because there is no clear evidence either on the &quot;existence of Moravia as a state&quot; after 902 (Spinei) or on its fall.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=69}} A short note in the ''[[Annales Alamannici]]'' refers to a &quot;war with the Hungarians in Moravia&quot; in 902, during which the &quot;land ''(patria)'' succumbed&quot;, but this text is ambiguous.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=141}} Alternatively, the so-called ''[[Raffelstetten Customs Regulations]]'' mentions the &quot;markets of the Moravians&quot; around 905.{{sfn|Bartl|2002|p=23}} The ''Life'' of Saint Naum relates that the Hungarians occupied Moravia, adding that the Moravians who &quot;were not captured by the Hungarians, ran to the Bulgars&quot;. Constantine Porphyrogenitus also connects the fall of Moravia to its occupation by the Hungarians.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=193}} The destruction of the early medieval urban centers and fortresses at [[Szepestamásfalva]] (Spišské Tomášovce), Dévény and other places in modern Slovakia is dated to the period around 900.{{sfn|Barford|2001|pp=109–111}}

{{Quote|After the death of (...)

According to Anonymous, who does not write of Moravia, the Hungarians invaded the region of [[Nyitra]] (Nitra, Slovakia) and defeated and killed Zobor, the local Czech ruler, on Mount Zobor near his seat.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=257}} Thereafter, as Anonymous continues, the Hungarians first occupied Pannonia from the &quot;Romans&quot; and next battled with [[Glad (duke)|Glad]] and his army composed of Bulgarians, Romanians and Pechenegs from Banat.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=15}} Glad ceded few towns from his duchy.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=22., 33., 39}} Finally, Anonymous writes of a treaty between the Hungarians and [[Menumorut]],{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=22}} stipulating that the local ruler's daughter was to be given in marriage to Árpád's son, [[Zoltán of Hungary|Zolta]].{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=62}} Macartney{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|p=25}} argues that Anonymous's narration of both Menumorot and of Glad is basically a transcription of a much later report of the early 11th-century [[Achtum]], Glad's alleged descendant.{{sfn|Macartney|1953|pp=71., 79}} In contrast, for instance, Madgearu maintains that ''Galad'', ''[[Kladova]]'', ''Gladeš'' and other place names recorded in Banat in the 14th century and 16th century attest to the memory of a local ruler named Glad.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005b|pp=35–36}}

{{Quote|[The Hungarians] reached the region of [[Bega River, Romania and Serbia|Bega]] and stayed there for two weeks while they conquered all the inhabitants of that land from the Mures to the Timis River and they received their sons as hostages.

An important event following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin, the Bavarians' murder of Kurszán, was recorded by the [[Annales Sangallenses maiores|longer version of the ''Annals of Saint Gall'']], the ''Annales Alamannici'' and the ''Annals of Einsiedeln''.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=201}} The first places the event in 902, while the others date it to 904.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=201}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=70}} The three chronicles unanimously state that the Bavarians invited the Hungarian leader to a dinner on the pretext of negotiating a peace treaty and treacherously assassinated him.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=250}} Kristó and other Hungarian historians argue that the dual leadership over the Hungarians ended with Kurszán's death.{{sfn|Kristó|1996a|p=203}}{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=251}}

The Hungarians invaded Italy using the so-called &quot;Route of the Hungarians&quot; ''(Strada Ungarorum)'' leading from Pannonia to Lombardy in 904.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=254}} They arrived as King [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar I]]'s allies{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=70}} against his rival, King [[Louis the Blind|Louis of Provance]]. The Hungarians devastated the territories occupied earlier by King Louis along the river [[Po (river)|Po]], which ensured Berengar's victory. The victorious monarch allowed the Hungarians to pillage all the towns that had earlier accepted his opponent's rule,{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=254}} and agreed to pay a yearly tribute of about {{convert|375|kg|lb}} of silver.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=70}}

The longer version of the ''Annals of Saint Gall'' reports that Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg fell, along with Bishops Uto of Freising and Zachary of Säben, in a &quot;disastrous battle&quot; fought against the Hungarians at ''Brezalauspurc'' on July 4, 907.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=258}} Other contemporary sources{{Clarify|date=November 2012}} add that Margrave Luitpold of Bavaria and 19 Bavarian counts{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=70}} also died in the battle.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=258}} Most historians (including Engel,{{sfn|Engel|2003|p=13}} Makkai,{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=12}} and Spinei) identify ''[[Battle of Pressburg#Location|Brezalauspurc]]'' with [[Pressburg]] (Bratislava, Slovakia), but some researchers (for instance Boba and Bowlus) argue that it can refer to [[Zalavár|Mosaburg]], Braslav's fortress on the Zala in Pannonia.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=72}}{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|pp=259–265}} The Hungarians' victory hindered any attempts of eastward expansion by East Francia for the following decades{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=72}} and opened the way for the Hungarians to freely plunder vast territories of that kingdom.{{sfn|Engel|2003|p=13}}

The Hungarians settled in the lowlands of the Carpathian Basin along the rivers Danube, Tisza and their tributaries,{{sfn|Spiesz|Caplovic|Bolchazy|2006|p=27}} where they could continue their semi-nomadic lifestyle.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=45}} As an immediate consequence, their arrival &quot;drove a non-Slavic wedge between the [[West Slavs]] and [[South Slavs]]&quot; (Fine).{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=139}} Fine argues that the Hungarians' departure from the western regions of the Pontic steppes weakened their former allies, the [[Khazars]], which contributed to the collapse of the [[Khazar Empire]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=139}}

Some decades after the Hungarian conquest, a new synthesis of earlier cultures, the &quot;[[Bijelo Brdo culture]]&quot; spread in all over the Carpathian Basin, with its characteristic jewellery, including S-shaped earrings.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=193}}{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=231}} The lack of archaeological finds connected to horses in &quot;Bijelo Brdo&quot; graves is another feature of these cemeteries.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=57}} The earliest &quot;Bijelo Brdo&quot; assemblages are dated via unearthed coins to the rule of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in the middle of the 10th&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=151}} Early cemeteries of the culture were unearthed, for instance, at [[Beremend]] and [[Csongrád]] in [[Hungary]], at [[Dévény]] (Devín) and [[Zsitvabesenyő]] (Bešenov) in Slovakia, at [[Gyulavarsánd]] (Varşand) and [[Várfalva]] (Moldoveneşti) in Romania and at [[Vukovar|Vukovár]] (Vukovar) and [[Kloštar Podravski|Gorbonok]] (Kloštar Podravski) in Croatia.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|pp=57–59}}

Hungarian society experienced fundamental changes in many fields (including animal husbandry, agriculture and religion) in the centuries following the &quot;Land-taking&quot;. These changes are reflected in the significant number of terms borrowed from local Slavs.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|pp=110–111}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=44, 57}} About 20% of the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] vocabulary is of Slavic origin,{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=57}} including the Hungarian words for sheep-pen ''(akol)'', yoke ''(iga)'' and horseshoe ''(patkó)''.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=111}} Similarly, the Hungarian name of vegetables, fruits and other cultivated plants, as well as many Hungarian terms connected to agriculture are Slavic [[loanword]]s, including ''káposzta'' (&quot;cabbage&quot;), ''szilva'' (&quot;plum&quot;), ''zab'' (&quot;oats&quot;), ''széna'' (&quot;[[hay]]&quot;) and ''kasza'' (&quot;[[scythe]]&quot;).{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=111}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=44, 57}}{{sfn|Hajdú|2004|p=243}}

The Hungarians left wide [[March (territory)|marches]] (the so-called ''[[gyepu|gyepű]]'') in the borderlands of their new homeland uninhabited for defensive purposes.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=44}} In this easternmost territory of the Carpathian Basin, the earliest graves attributed to Hungarian warriors{{mdash}}for instance, at [[Szék]] (Sic), [[Turda|Torda]] (Turda) and [[Vízakna]] (Ocna Sibiului){{mdash}}are concentrated around the Transylvanian salt mines in the valley of the rivers [[Kis-Szamos]] (Someșul Mic) and [[Maros]] (Mureş).{{sfn|Madgearu|2005a|pp=110–111}} All the same, warriors were also stationed in outposts east of the Carpathians, as suggested by 10th-century graves unearthed at [[Krylos]], [[Przemyśl]], [[Sudova Vyshnia]], [[Grozeşti, Iasi|Grozeşti]], [[Probota]] and at [[Tei, Bucharest|Tei]].{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=118}} The Hungarians' fear of their eastern neighbors, the Pechenegs, is demonstrated by Porphyrogenitus's report on the failure of a Byzantine envoy to persuade them to attack the Pechenegs.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=145}} The Hungarians clearly stated that they could not fight against the Pechenegs, because &quot;their people are numerous and they are the devil's brats&quot;.{{sfn|Kristó|1996b|p=145}}&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 8), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MunkácsyHonfoglalásPM.jpg|190px|thumb|left|alt=Mihály Munkácsy's painting|[[Mihály Munkácsy]]: ''Conquest'' (1893)]]
Instead of attacking the Pechenegs and the Bulgarians in the east, the Hungarians made several raids in Western Europe.{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=12}} For instance, they plundered [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] in 908, Bavaria and [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]] in 909 and 910 and Swabia, [[Duchy of Lotharingia|Lorraine]] and [[West Francia]] in 912.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=72}} Although a Byzantine hagiography of Saint George refers to a joint attack of Pechenegs, &quot;Moesians&quot; and Hungarians against the Byzantine Empire in 917, its reliability is not established.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|pp=76–77}} The Hungarians seem to have raided the Byzantine Empire for the first time in 943.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=77}} However, their defeat in the [[battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 &quot;put an end to the raids in the West&quot; (Kontler), while they stopped plundering the Byzantines following their defeat in the [[Battle of Arcadiopolis (970)|battle of Arkadiopolis]] in 970.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=47}}

The Hungarian leaders decided that their traditional lifestyle, partly based on plundering raids against sedentary peoples, could not be continued.{{sfn|Spiesz|Caplovic|Bolchazy|2006|p=20}} The defeats at the Lechfeld and Arkadiopolis accelerated the Hungarians' adoption of a sedentary way of life.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=47}} This process culminated in the coronation of the [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians|head of the Hungarians]], [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen]] the first [[king of Hungary]] in 1000 and 1001.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=84}}
