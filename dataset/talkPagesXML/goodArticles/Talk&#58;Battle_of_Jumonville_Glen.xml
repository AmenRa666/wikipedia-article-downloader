== WikiProject class rating==
This article was automatically  assessed because at least one article was rated and this bot brought all the other ratings up to at least that level. [[User:BetacommandBot|BetacommandBot]] 02:29, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Assessment/Tag &amp; Assess 2008]] ==
Ensured that the article is within project scope, tagged for task forces, and assessed for class. --[[User:Rosiestep|Rosiestep]] ([[User talk:Rosiestep|talk]]) 21:05, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

== Pronunciation help ==

I am in contact with a professional voice actor who is trying to record a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia|spoken version]] of [[George Washington]] and he wants to hear someone pronounce &quot;Battle of Jumonville Glen&quot;. If anyone would be willing to call him up or even leave a voice mail with the proper pronunciation, please [[Special:Emailuser/Howcheng|email me]] and I will send you his contact info. Thanks. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana; &quot;&gt;'''[[User:Howcheng|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#33C;&quot;&gt;howcheng&lt;/span&gt;]]'''  &lt;small&gt;{[[User talk:Howcheng|chat]]}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 18:00, 30 May 2008 (UTC)

==Going to Fix this up==
This is a mess, I'm going to fix it up. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 23:56, 15 August 2008 (UTC)

==It continues to be a mess==
For reasons unknown (to me), this article has been heavily edited and now relies on a single source, omitting other sources and many of the details of the battle in parallel Wikipedia entries (see the entry &quot;Joseph Coulon de Jumonville&quot; which contains a much better account of the battle). This article is now misleading at best, and omits primary sources such as detail from Washington's own diaries on the battle as well as contemporary French accounts. While the English and French may not have been technically at war at the time, they were headed towards it, and this clash which set off the Seven Years War (called the French and Indian War in North America) became a world wide conflict that didn't really end until Napoleon was defeated in 1815. The North American war was a sideshow to the world war, but a cause celebre of the day among both the English and the French propagandists.

In its present state, I would say that this article has been badly vandalized and needs an extensive rework. [[User:Rarkm|Rarkm]] ([[User talk:Rarkm|talk]]) 06:14, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

==Assassination?==
This article says Jumonville was assassinated after surrendering.  The article on Jumonville, however, goes into more detail, and offers the possibility that Jumonville was killed in battle, and that the assassination story was a bit of French propaganda which was denied by the British forces.  If such controversy exists, it should be stated in the article. [[User:Mingusboodle|Mingusboodle]] ([[User talk:Mingusboodle|talk]]) 23:44, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

==Terminology complaint==
(This was addressed to me on my talk page. It is more appropriately discussed here. ''[[User:Magicpiano|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:khaki;color:firebrick;&quot;&gt;Magic&lt;/span&gt;]]''[[User_talk:Magicpiano|♪piano]] 21:55, 8 March 2011 (UTC))

It seems you are quite indifferent to historical accuracy!  All the soldiers involved were born in Canada.  What do you call the colonists during the American Revolution, British as well, so we have British versus British.  Also take a look at the Quebec Act of 1774, King George III refers to his Canadian subjects throughout the Act, not his French subjects.--[[User:Varing|Varing]] ([[User talk:Varing|talk]]) 21:47, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

:You didn't read my edit summary.  You altered words in a significant number of quotations, where the word used was e.g. &quot;French&quot;, and not &quot;French-Canadian&quot; or &quot;Canadien&quot;.  Rather than tediously fix the many places you broke this, I reverted all of your changes.  If the correctness of terminology is important to you, you should understand the importance of accurate quotation as well.  As I said in the edit summary, feel free to make edits that don't violate the integrity of quoted material. ''[[User:Magicpiano|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:khaki;color:firebrick;&quot;&gt;Magic&lt;/span&gt;]]''[[User_talk:Magicpiano|♪piano]] 21:51, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

:Furthermore, the composition of the French force was already correctly identified as [[Canadien]] before your edits; since I wrote those words, it shows I am ''not'' indifferent to historical accuracy.  The fact that the word &quot;French&quot; is at times used in place of &quot;French-Canadian&quot; or &quot;Canadien&quot; should not obviously increase the ambiguity or inaccuracy of the statement; all of these people were at the time [[French people|French subjects]]. ''[[User:Magicpiano|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:khaki;color:firebrick;&quot;&gt;Magic&lt;/span&gt;]]''[[User_talk:Magicpiano|♪piano]] 22:12, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

==Sending Jumonville==
The Canadien force &quot;sent Jumonville to warn Washington about encroaching on French-claimed territory.&quot;.  This doesn't appear to be correct: did Jumonville encounter Washington elsewhere before the battle? Who &quot;sent&quot; him?--[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] ([[User talk:Wetman|talk]]) 18:42, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
:Well, this article is all about their eventual meeting.  As for who sent Jumonville, that question is answered in the body of the article.
