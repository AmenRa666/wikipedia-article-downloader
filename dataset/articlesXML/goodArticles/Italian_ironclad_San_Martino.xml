'''''San Martino''''' was a {{sclass-|Regina Maria Pia|ironclad|0}} [[ironclad warship]], the second member of her class. She was built for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' in the 1860s; like her three [[sister ship]]s, she was built in France. ''San Martino'' was laid down in July 1862, was launched in September 1863, and was completed in November 1864. The ships were [[broadside ironclad]]s, mounting a battery of four {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} and twenty-two {{convert|164|mm|abbr=on}} guns on the [[broadside]].

''San Martino'' saw action at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]], fought during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] in 1866. There she was in the center of the action, at the head of the Italian main body. Of the three ships in her division, ''San Martino'' was the only vessel to survive the battle. After the war, the ship's career was uneventful, the result of the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a [[central battery ship]] some time after Lissa, and was modernized again in the late 1880s. The ship was eventually broken up for scrap in 1903.

==Design==
{{main|Regina Maria Pia-class ironclad}}
[[File:Regina Maria Pia (1863) Plan.jpg|thumb|left|Line-drawing of ''Regina Maria Pia'' in her 1888 configuration]]

''San Martino'' was {{convert|81.2|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]]; she had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|15.24|m|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.35|m|abbr=on}}. She had a crew of 480&amp;ndash;485&amp;nbsp;officers and men. She was a [[broadside ironclad]], and she was initially armed with a [[main battery]] of four {{convert|8|in|abbr=on|0}} guns and twenty-two {{convert|164|mm|abbr=on}} guns, though her armament changed throughout her career. The ship was protected by iron [[belt armor]] that was {{convert|4.75|in|abbr=on|0}} thick and extended for the entire length of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] at the [[waterline]]. The battery deck was protected by {{convert|4.3|in|abbr=on}} of iron plate.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;

''San Martino'' displaced {{convert|4201|MT|sp=us}} normally and up to {{convert|4527|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion [[steam engine]] that drove a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by six coal-fired, rectangular [[boiler]]s. Her engine produced a top speed of {{convert|12.6|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|2620|ihp|lk=in}}. She could steam for {{convert|2600|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. The ship was initially [[schooner]]-rigged to supplement the steam engine, though her masts were later reduced to a [[barque]] rig. Ultimately, she lost her sailing rig completely, having it replaced with a pair of [[military mast]]s with [[fighting top]]s.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;

==Service history==
The [[keel]] for ''San Martino'' was laid down at the ''[[Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée]]'' shipyard in [[La Seyne]], France, on 22 July 1862. She was launched on 21 September 1863, and completed on 9 November 1864.&lt;ref name=G339&gt;Gardiner, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, as part of the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], which was fought concurrently with the [[Austro-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name=S1&gt;Sondhaus, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian fleet commander, Admiral [[Carlo Pellion di Persano]], initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austrian Navy]], despite the fact that the Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own. Persano claimed he was simply waiting on the ironclad ram {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}, ''en route'' from Britain, but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet, with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 217&amp;ndash;222&lt;/ref&gt;

Rear Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] brought the Austrian fleet to [[Ancona]] on June 27, in attempt to draw out the Italians. At the time, many of the Italian ships were in disarray;
several ships did not have their entire armament, and several others had problems with their engines. ''San Martino'' was one of the few ironclads fit for action, so she, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Castelfidardo||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Regina Maria Pia||2}}, and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Principe di Carignano||2}} formed up to prepare to attack Tegetthoff's ships. Persano held a council of war aboard ''Principe di Carignano'' to determine whether he should sortie to engage Tegetthoff, but by that time, the Austrians had withdrawn, making the decision moot. The Minister of the Navy, [[Agostino Depretis]], urged Persano to act and suggested the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], to restore Italian confidence after their defeat at the [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]] the previous month. On 7 July, Persano left Ancona and conducted a sweep into the Adriatic, but encountered no Austrian ships and returned on the 13th.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 216&amp;ndash;218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Lissa===
[[File:Battle of Lissa - 1866 - Initial Situation.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing the disposition of the fleets on 20 July]]
{{main|Battle of Lissa (1866)}}

On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet out of Ancona, bound for Lissa, where they arrived on the 18th. With them, they brought troop transports carrying 3,000 soldiers; the Italian warships began bombarding the Austrian forts on the island, with the intention of landing the soldiers once the fortresses had been silenced. In response, the Austrian Navy sent the fleet under Tegetthoff to attack the Italian ships.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, pp. 1&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, ''San Martino'' was assigned to the 2nd Division, under Persano, along with the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}} and the [[coastal defense ship]] {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Palestro||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving off Lissa on the 18th,&lt;ref name=S1/&gt; Persano sent most of his ships to bombard the town of [[Vis (town)|Vis]], but Persano was unable to effect the landing.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; The next morning, Persano ordered another attack; four ironclads would force the harbor defenses at Vis while ''San Martino'' and the rest of the fleet would attempt to suppress the outer fortifications. This second attack also proved to be a failure, but Persano decided to make a third attempt the next day. ''San Martino'' and the bulk of the fleet would again try to disable the outer forts in preparation for the landing.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 222&amp;ndash;224&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Italians could begin the attack, the [[dispatch boat]] {{ship|Italian dispatch boat|Esploratore||2}} arrived, bringing news of Tegetthoff's approach. Persano's fleet was in disarray; the three ships of Admiral [[Giovanni Vacca (admiral)|Giovanni Vacca's]] 1st Division were three miles to the northeast from Persano's main force, and three other ironclads were further away to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 223&amp;ndash;225&lt;/ref&gt; Persano immediately ordered his ships to form up with Vacca's, first in [[line abreast]] formation, and then in [[line ahead]] formation. ''San Martino'' was at the center of the Italian line.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the action began, Persano decided to leave his flagship and transfer to ''Affondatore'', though none of his subordinates on the other ships were aware of the change. They there thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping ''Re d'Italia'', he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships and the rest of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, though he failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians then turned back toward Persano's ships, and took ''Re d'Italia'', ''San Martino'', and ''Palestro'' under heavy fire. ''San Martino'' initially engaged the unarmored ships of the Austrian 2nd Division, but as ''Re d'Italia'' became embroiled in the ensuing melee, ''San Martino''{{'}}s captain attempted to come to her aid, though the ship was unable to prevent the Austrian flagship, {{SMS|Erzherzog Ferdinand Max|1865|2}}, from ramming and sinking her.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 234&amp;ndash;235, 247&lt;/ref&gt; Tegetthoff immediately ordered his crew to lower boats to pick up the men in the water, but with ''San Martino'' fast approaching, he could not leave his ship a stationary target. He instead ordered the small [[aviso]] {{SMS|Kaiserin Elizabeth||2}} to pick up the Italian survivors, but she too came under fire and was forced to abandon the effort.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p237&amp;ndash;238&lt;/ref&gt;

During the battle, ''San Martino'' collided with ''Regina Maria Pia'' and had her [[naval ram|ram bow]] twisted, causing leaks in her hull.&lt;ref name=W245&gt;Wilson, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Persano broke off the engagement to consolidate his forces, but his ships, low on coal and ammunition, and with badly demoralized crews, could not be rallied by Persano's half-hearted attempt to launch an attack. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and [[Pula|Pola]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 238&amp;ndash;241, 250&lt;/ref&gt; ''San Martino'' had been hit numerous times, and had her side armor penetrated by one shell, which did not succeed in penetrating the timber backing. Twice during the engagement, the ship was set on fire by Austrian shells, though her crew was able to put the fires out.&lt;ref name=W245/&gt; After the battle, Vacca replaced Persano; he was ordered to attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
For the rest of her long career, ''San Martino'' served in a variety of roles, both in the main fleet and in [[Italian Empire|Italy's colonial empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Ordovini et al., pp. 343&amp;ndash;344&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the Italian government slashed the naval budget so significantly that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of [[Civitavecchia]] in September 1870, as part of the [[Italian unification|wars of Italian unification]]. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors [[conscript]]ed to man them were sent home.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after 1866, the ship was rebuilt as a [[central battery ship]], with most of her guns located in a central, armored [[casemate]]. Two other guns were placed in the bow as [[chase gun]]s, with a third mounted as a stern chaser. At this time, her armament was also revised, to two {{convert|220|mm|abbr=on}} guns in the bow and nine 8&amp;nbsp;in guns, four on each [[broadside]] and the last in the stern.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;

''San Martino'' took part in the annual 1888 fleet maneuvers, along with the ironclads {{ship|Italian ironclad|Lepanto||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Italia||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}}, and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Enrico Dandolo||2}}, one [[protected cruiser]], four [[torpedo cruiser]]s, and numerous smaller vessels. The maneuvers consisted of close-order drills and a simulated attack on and defense of La Spezia.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1888 and 1890, the ship had her barque rig replaced with military masts. By this time, she had been rearmed with eight {{convert|6|in|abbr=on}} guns in the casemate and several smaller guns for close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included five {{convert|4.7|in|abbr=on}} guns, four {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and eight {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss revolver cannon]]s. She also received three [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt; In 1894, the ship was assigned to the Third Division of the Italian fleet, along with the newly commissioned [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Liguria||2}} and the [[torpedo cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Confienza||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Naval and Military Notes&quot;, p. 565&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1903 and thereafter [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;
