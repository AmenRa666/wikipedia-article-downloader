== Images ==
3 images of Cambodian soldiers. It is over adequate and unfair. Deletion of those images is good. If you want to have those 3 images, you have to add 3 more Thai soldiers' images. Please do not revert until the discussion is closed. --[[User:Passawuth|Passawuth]] ([[User talk:Passawuth|talk]]) 14:14, 3 August 2008 (UTC)

:Furthermore, I think those images ought to disappear from the article since this is the article that is shown on main page. The images on this article should have copyright status and description clearly. This is to be an example of other articles likewise GA and FA. --[[User:Passawuth|Passawuth]] ([[User talk:Passawuth|talk]]) 14:20, 3 August 2008 (UTC)

The opinion above, on the posted image, should be seriously taken in account since they, the images, tend to give viewer a sense of partiality. Yet, I fear that the choice of adding photos of Thai military may result in increased tension, or worse, some sort of vandalism act. (Particularly, between users from the two disputing nations, since this case is very sensitive) Removal of the images might be the better way. [[User:Eakka|Eakka]] ([[User talk:Eakka|talk]]) 10:51, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

Yep. I had removed all of the images now. I will report to the administrator to semi-protect the page in order to stop the adding of images and will be then easier to notice or block anyone trying to add images without discussion yet. --[[User:Passawuth|Passawuth]] ([[User talk:Passawuth|talk]]) 15:15, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

:The See Also section seems relevent for background and the Aug 3rd event is sourced to a third party media outlet (BBC) so I will re-add that with modified wording. The pictures, while there is at least one I think is nice, lack copyright info. Until that is provided, I'd be reluctant to add any to a recent events article. [[User:Narson|Narson]] ([[User talk:Narson|talk]]) 15:29, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

==Introductory paragraph==

The introductory paragraph should be general, not detailed, and neutral, not partisan, in tone.  It should avoid presenting the claims of either side, which are disputed, as though they were settled facts.  The claims can be referenced, of course, but they should be described rather than adjudicated.  Comments on the respective claims should be reserved, and clearly labelled as comments, evaluation or analysis.[[User:Fconaway|Fconaway]] ([[User talk:Fconaway|talk]]) 02:53, 13 August 2008 (UTC)

Er, actually some of those &quot;claims&quot; are settled facts. If you read the ICJ judgement, you would know this. A major part of what has driven this dispute for four decades has been the successive Thai governments' refusal to communicate (or publish in Thai) the full ICJ judgement, thus allowing them to pull the wool over the eyes of most of the Thai people all of the time.[[User:KhProd1|KhProd1]] ([[User talk:KhProd1|talk]]) 10:30, 15 October 2008 (UTC)

I just read the article, and by my figures 5 thai troops have been killed, 16 wounded, as well as 5 cambodian troops willed, but 3 wounded. Somehow i dont think the article is very clear on casualties and the wounded. we need to clear this up. 

Also i think we should include a little section on the weapons being used by both sides. are the only using Small Arms fire + RPG's, or have they exchanged any fire with artillery or tanks.  [[User:Nath1991|Nath1991]] ([[User talk:Nath1991|talk]]) 07:28, 24 April 2009 (UTC)
: There's been a continuous media battle over numbers of casualties and deaths after each incident. That battle has then been reflected once more here (I have this article on my watchlist). Cambodian media reports high Thai casualties, Thai media reports high Cambodian casualties, then they argue over who is right. Depending on which source you use you can probably find a news agency to support the high numbers of casualties for either side - nationalist madness doesn't only happen on the border :) This makes accurate casualty reporting very difficult for us. My suggestion would be to only use independent media sources, wait for 48 hours after each battle before updating (initial reports are often inflated), have 4 or 5 editors watchlist the article and revert unsourced changes with extreme prejudice :) I'm willing to help out with this, but beware you will be taking on ocassional POV warriors.

True, I'sppose on both sides its a propoganda war, i woulda thought using sources from Neutral perspective, like the BBC for instance would give you a more clearer idea. i got some spare time, do you want me to leave it as it is for now, or i can try and find as many news articles as possible to get a clearer idea [[User:Nath1991|Nath1991]] ([[User talk:Nath1991|talk]]) 00:33, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

:Nath, if you've got some time go for it! Anything sourced from the major wire services should be OK, Reuters, AFP etc. BBC should be ok as well.

Well, ive had a look to see any solid sources, that arn't Thai or Cambodian, but its extremly difficult, doesn't seem like many major news services worldwide are interested. But by using simple mathmatics, reading the sources that are there, it seems that the casualty count isn't that high. By my last count it seemed that 
Cambodia: 5 killed 3 Wounded
Thailand: 5 Killed 16 wounded
Also i checked a few of the sources, and some have deleated the articles, for i can't seem to find them...which further makes this more difficult. I suppose we won't know the full casualty count until the standoff has been resolved,...[[User:Nath1991|Nath1991]] ([[User talk:Nath1991|talk]]) 11:04, 26 April 2009 (UTC)
:As in most conflicts, one of the reported deaths was self-inflicted, and two were wounded by stepping on land mines.

We may never know.[[User:Fconaway|Fconaway]] ([[User talk:Fconaway|talk]]) 02:13, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

:Considering the info and sources we have, the Cambodian casualty's seem much more realistic, considering the amount of skirmishes they have had, unlike the Thai's which seems way too high, considering. And can we take seriously the claims of taking POWs. [[User:Nath1991|Nath1991]] ([[User talk:Nath1991|talk]]) 07:33, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

== Commanders? ==

Despite the fact that King Bhumibol Adulyadej is the Commander-in-Chief of the Thai Armed Force by constitution, I don't think it is reasonable or appropriate to named him as the commander in this conflict as he made no real decision or planning here and since Cambodia didn't listed their King as commander too.

: The Franco-Siamese Convention and Protocol of February 13, 1904 puts the boundary in the location of the temple along the watershed of the Dangrek mountains:
::''Article 1:  The boundary between Siam and Cambodia starts, on the left bank of Grand Lac, from the mouth of the Stung-Rolvos river; it follows the parallel of this point eastward until joining the river Prek-Kompong-Tiam, then, ascending northward, it merges with the meridian at this juncture until the Pnom-Dang-Rek mountain chain.  From there it follows the watershed between the Nam-Sen and Mekong basins, on the one hand, and the Nam-Moun on the other....''
It was re-affirmed and modified by the Treaty between France and Siam relative to Frontiers and Jurisdiction, Bangkok, March 23, 1907 with attached Protocol.[[User:DLinth|DLinth]] ([[User talk:DLinth|talk]]) 20:09, 15 February 2011 (UTC)

== POV-pushing ==

An anonymous user is constantly inserting unreferenced numbers of dead into the infobox. If this continues the article should be protected for a period of time. It has been discussed and agreed upon that we only put the numbers of killed and captured in the infobox, no numbers on the tanks or house or such that may have been destroyed. I calculated that before the February clashes 5 Cambodian and 6 Thai soldiers were killed. In the newest clashes the Thai claim is that 64 Cambodians died (which I put in the brackets) and the Cambodians claim 53 Thais died (which I also put in the brackets, two sources, one 33 for the first day the other for the second day 20), with the previus claim by the Cambodians to have killed 88 Thais that makes a Cambodian claim of 141 dead. Independent sources have stated that 4 Cambodian and 1 Thai soldier have died in the February clashes. So we will put 5+4 which is 9 that nine Cambodian soldiers died so far and 6+1 which is seven that seven Thai soldiers died so far. To update the Thai claim for the Cambodians in the brackets we will put the 64 claim for February plus the independent sources of 5 killed in the previous years for a total of 69.[[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 03:12, 9 February 2011 (UTC)

Please removed the Cambodia claims's part in the introduction section, which point to a DEAD source.

&quot;Cambodia also claims the Ta Moan Thom complex 153 km to the west of Preah Vihear, near the border between the Thai Surin province and the Cambodian Oddar Meancheay province. Though some sources suggest otherwise, the Sdok Kok Thom Temple in Thailand's Aranyaprathet District is unlikely to become a source of dispute, as it is 1.6 km inside Thailand at a well-demarcated, undisputed section of the boundary in a heavily settled area, unlike Preah Vihear and Ta Moan Thom.[9]&quot;

And replace it with a claim from a reliable source http://www.un.int/cambodia/Bulletin_Files/July08/Letter_18_Jul.pdf

&quot;Cambodia claims about 50 Thai soldiers crossed into Keo Sikha Kiri Svara pagoda located in Cambodia's territory at about 300 meters from the Temple of Preah Vihear. &quot;

&quot; 17 KIA on February 8, '11 [12][13] &quot;

HAS REFERENCES TO SOURCES [12] and [13]

Sources [12] and [13] does not state anything about 17 Thai casualties

[12] &quot;A Thai soldier has been shot dead and four wounded in clashes with Cambodian troops in a disputed border area.&quot;;
[13] &quot;BANGKOK, April 29 (UPI)&quot;


Source [12] mentions only 1 casualty, Source [13] has article date that is not relevant to February 8 casualties
