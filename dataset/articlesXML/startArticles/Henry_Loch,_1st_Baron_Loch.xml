'''Henry Brougham Loch, 1st Baron Loch''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCB|GCMG}} (23 May 1827 – 20 June 1900) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] soldier and colonial administrator.

==Military service==
Henry Loch was the son of [[James Loch]], [[Member of Parliament]], of [[Drylaw]], [[Midlothian]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{harvnb|Atlay|Benyon|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[Royal Navy]], but at the end of two years quit it for the [[British East India Company]]'s military service, and in 1842 obtained a commission in the [[Bengal Light Cavalry]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1845–1846 he was given an appointment on the staff of [[Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough|Sir Hugh Gough]], and served throughout the [[Sutlej]] campaign.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In 1852 he became adjutant of Skinner's Horse.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

At the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]] in 1854, Loch severed his connection with India, and obtained leave to raise a body of irregular [[Bulgaria]]n cavalry, which he commanded throughout the war.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In 1857 he was appointed attaché to [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]]'s mission to East Asia, was present at the taking of [[Guangzhou|Canton (Guangzhou)]] during the [[Second Opium War]], and in 1858 brought home the [[Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce|Treaty of Yedo]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In April 1860, Loch accompanied Lord Elgin to China again, as secretary of the new embassy sent to secure the execution by the Chinese [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] of its treaty engagements. The embassy was backed up by an allied Anglo-French force. With [[Harry Smith Parkes]] he negotiated the surrender of the [[Taku Forts|Taku Forts (Dagu Forts)]]. During the advance on the Qing capital, [[Beijing|Peking (Beijing)]], Loch was chosen with Parkes to complete the preliminary negotiations for peace at Tungchow (present-day [[Tongzhou District, Beijing]]). They were accompanied by a small party of officers and Sikhs. It having been discovered that the Chinese were planning an attack on the British force, Loch rode back and warned the outposts. He then returned to Parkes and his party under a flag of truce in the hope of securing their safety. However, they were all taken prisoner by the Qing general [[Sengge Rinchen]] and incarcerated in the [[Three Departments and Six Ministries|Ministry of Justice (or Board of Punishments)]] in Beijing, where the majority of the group died from torture or disease. Parkes and Loch were treated more leniently after [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]] intervened. After three weeks, the negotiations for their release were successful, but they had only been liberated ten minutes when orders were received from the [[Xianfeng Emperor]], who was then taking shelter in the [[Chengde Mountain Resort|Chengde Summer Palace]], for their immediate execution.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In 1862, Loch married Elizabeth Villiers, whose twin sister was [[Edith Villiers]]. There is a tale that Henry proposed to the wrong girl by mistake and then refused to admit it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Lyndsey Jenkins|title=Lady Constance Lytton: Aristocrat, Suffragette, Martyr|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7nqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24|date=12 March 2015|publisher=Biteback Publishing|isbn=978-1-84954-892-2|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Elizabeth had two daughters and a son.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Colonial administrator==
Loch never entirely recovered his health after this experience in a Chinese dungeon. Returning home he was made Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]], and for a while was private secretary to [[Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet]], then at the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In 1863 he was appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Isle_of_Man.htm World Statesmen]&lt;/ref&gt; During his governorship the [[House of Keys]] was transformed into an elective assembly, the first line of railway was opened, and the influx of tourists began to bring fresh prosperity to the island. In 1882 Loch, who had become Knight Commander of the Bath in 1880, accepted a commissionership of woods and forests, and two years later was made governor of the colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In June 1889 he succeeded Sir [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Hercules Robinson]] as Governor of [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and [[High Commissioner for Southern Africa]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

As [[High Commissioner]] his duties called for the exercise of great judgment and firmness. The [[Boer]]s were at the same time striving to frustrate [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s schemes of northern expansion and planning to occupy [[Mashonaland]], to secure control of [[Swaziland]] and [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] and to acquire the adjacent lands up to the ocean. Loch firmly supported Rhodes, and, by informing President [[Paul Kruger]] that troops would be sent to prevent any invasion of territory under British protection, he effectually crushed the [[Banyailand]] trek across the [[Limpopo River]] (1890–1891). Loch, however, with the approval of the imperial government, concluded in July–August 1890 a convention with President Kruger respecting Swaziland, by which, while the Boers withdrew all claims to territory north of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], they were granted an outlet to the sea at [[Kosi Bay]] on condition that the republic entered the South African Customs Union. This convention was concluded after negotiations conducted with President Kruger by [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)|Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr]] on behalf of the high commissioner, and was made at a time when the British and Bond parties in Cape Colony were working in harmony.

The Transvaal did not fulfil the necessary conditions, and in view of an increasingly hostile attitude from Pretoria administration Loch became a strong advocate of annexation of the territory east of Swaziland, through which the Boer railway would have to pass to the sea.  At length he induced the British government to adopt his view; and on 15 March 1895 it was announced that these territories ([[Amatongaland]], etc.), would be annexed by Britain, an announcement received by Kruger with the greatest astonishment and regret.

Meanwhile, Loch had been forced to intervene in another matter. When the commandeering difficulty of 1894 had roused the [[Uitlander]]s in the Transvaal to a dangerous pitch of excitement, he travelled to [[Pretoria]] to use his personal influence with President Kruger, and obtained the withdrawal of the obnoxious commandeering regulations.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In the following year he entered a strong protest against the new Transvaal franchise law.  Nonetheless the general situation in South Africa was assuming year by year a more threatening aspect. Cecil Rhodes, then prime minister of Cape Colony, was strongly in favor of a more energetic policy than was supported by the Imperial government.  At the end of March 1895 the high commissioner, finding himself, it is believed, out of touch with his ministers, returned home embarrassed, a few months before the expiry of his term of office. In the same year he was raised to the [[peerage]] as '''Baron Loch''', of Drylaw in the County of Midlothian.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=26645 |date=19 July 1895 |startpage=4102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Second Boer War]] broke out in 1899 Loch took a leading part in raising and equipping a body of mounted men, named after him Loch's Horse. He died in London on 20 June 1900, and was succeeded as Baron Loch by his son [[Edward Loch, 2nd Baron Loch|Edward Douglas Loch]] (1873–1942).&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;
