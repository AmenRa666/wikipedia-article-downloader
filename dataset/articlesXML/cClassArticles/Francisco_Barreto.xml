'''Francisco Barreto''' (occasionally '''Francisco de Barreto''', 1520 – July 9, 1573) was a Portuguese soldier and explorer. An officer in [[Morocco]] during his early life, Barreto sailed to [[Portuguese India]] and was eventually appointed [[viceroy of Portuguese India|viceroy of the colony]]. After his return to [[Lisbon]], he was tasked with an expedition to southeast Africa in search of legendary gold mines. Barreto died in what is now Mozambique, having never reached the mines.

==Early life==
Barreto was born in [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], Portugal, in 1520, to Rui Barreto and Branca de Vilhena. He received military training in [[Morocco]], and eventually became captain and governor of [[Azemmour]], near [[Casablanca]].&lt;ref name=ipv&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ipv.pt/millenium/arq5_2.htm|title= Ensaio de Portugalidem Terras Africanas durante a Governação d´El-Rei D.Sebastião: D.Francisco Barreto em Moçambique e na Região do Monomotapa|accessdate=2007-09-05 |last=Branco|first=Alberto M. Vara|work= Millennium|publisher=[[Polytechnic Institute of Viseu]]|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viceroy in Goa==
[[File:Blason of Goa (ancient).svg|thumb|120px|right|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Portuguese Conquest of Goa (1510)|Portuguese colony of Goa]]]]
In 1547 Barreto arrived in [[Portuguese India]]. He took up the position of [[viceroy]] in [[Goa]], headquarters of the colony, in June 1555,&lt;ref name=ipv/&gt; following the death of [[Pedro Mascarenhas]].&lt;ref name=kerr&gt;{{cite book |editor=Robert Kerr |title=A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels |year= 1812|publisher=William Blackwood |location=Edinburgh |pages=410–412 |chapter=Conquest of India |editor-link= Robert Kerr (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of his investiture, a play by [[Luís de Camões]], ''[[Auto de Filodemo]]'', was put on.&lt;ref name=ewb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title =Luis Vaz de Camoëns |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of World Biography |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]] |location= |id= |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/luis-vaz-de-camoens/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barreto later ordered Camões exiled to [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] (also a Portuguese colony) for his satirical ''[[Disparates da Índia]]'', which criticized Portuguese life in India.&lt;ref name=ipv/&gt;

During his tenure as viceroy, the intended Catholic Patriarch for [[Ethiopia]] arrived, accompanied by an embassy led by Fernando de Sousa de Castello Branco, on 15 March 1556. Because he had more accurate information on matters in that country, Barreto held back most of this party, although allowing Bishop [[André de Oviedo]] to continue with some companions. This small group, carried in four small ships, landed at [[Arqiqo]] in March 1557, shortly before the [[Ottoman Empire]] occupied that port.&lt;ref&gt;[[Baltazar Téllez]], ''The Travels of the Jesuits in Ethiopia'', 1710 (LaVergue: Kessinger, 2010), pp. 138f&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in ''A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels'', Mascarenhas, in a bid to gain a Portuguese ally in the region, had supported a usurper against one [[Adel Khan]], King of [[Visapur]].&lt;ref name=kerr/&gt; Mascarenhas died shortly after sending soldiers to aid in the usurper's takeover, and Barreto continued Portuguese support of the usurper until his capture. In 1557, Barreto clashed with Khan's army at [[Ponda, Goa|Ponda]] and was victorious.&lt;ref name=kerr/&gt;

==Return to Lisbon==
Barreto was succeeded by [[Constantino de Bragança]] in 1558, and he left Goa for [[Lisbon]] aboard the ''Águia'' on January 20, 1559. After a damaging storm she was repaired in what is now [[Mozambique]], and set sail again on November 17 of the same year. Soon after she sprang a leak, and returned to the African coast.&lt;ref name=mccall&gt;{{cite book |last=Theal |first= George McCall |authorlink=George McCall Theal |title=The Beginning of South African History |year=1902|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin |location= London|pages=287 |chapter= Knowledge derived from Shipwrecks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barreto returned to Goa on a different boat, almost dying of thirst on the trip. Once back he again set sail for Lisbon, this time on the ''São Gião''. She reached the Portuguese capital in June 1561, 29 months after Barreto first left the city.&lt;ref name=mccall/&gt;

In 1564, King [[Philip II of Spain]] requested Portuguese naval aid in capturing [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera]], an island off the coast of Morocco. Portugal supplied and Barreto commanded a fleet consisting of a galleon and eight caravels alongside Spaniard [[García de Toledo]], and the combined navy took over the island's fort in two days.&lt;ref name=ipv/&gt;

==Expedition to Monomotapa==
After Barreto's return to Portugal, King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]] gave him the job of leading an expedition to [[Monomotapa]] (Great Zimbabwe) to take over the empire's legendary gold mines. According to historian [[Diogo de Couto]], the reason for the expedition was that Portuguese [[mercantilism|mercantilists]] thought that the country needed mines to bring in gold similar to Spain's in the Americas (the country's colonies in Asia were not bringing sufficient wealth back to Portugal).&lt;ref name=diffie&gt;{{cite book |last= Diffie|first=Bailey W. |author2=George D. Winius|title=Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415-1580 |series=Europe and the World in the Age of Expansion|date=November 1977 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |isbn=978-0-8166-0782-2 |pages=347 |chapter=The Shape of Empire: The Western Periphery }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barreto was given instructions to &quot;undertake nothing of importance without the advice and concurrence&quot; of [[Jesuit]] [[Francisco Monclaros]].&lt;ref name=kerr447&gt;Kerr, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

Barreto set sail from Lisbon on April 16, 1569, with three ships, 1,000 men,&lt;ref name=ipv/&gt; and the title of ''Conqueror of the Mines'', bestowed upon him by the king.&lt;ref name=kerr447/&gt; The first boat arrived in Mozambique in August 1569, Barreto's on March 14 of the next year, and the third ship months later. Although Barreto opted to take the easier route, via [[Sofala]], to the location of the mines, Monclaros demanded that the expedition take the [[Sena, Mozambique|Sena]] route, as this would lead them to where another Jesuit, [[Gonçalo da Silveira]], had been thrown into a river and killed in 1561.&lt;ref name=ipv/&gt; So the expedition set out for [[Manica Province|Manica]], the reputed location of the great mines, via the Sena route.&lt;ref name=kerr447/&gt;

The expedition sailed up the [[Cuama]] river in November 1571, armed with weapons and mining tools, and arrived in the Sena region on December 18.&lt;ref name=ipv/&gt; Barreto sent an envoy to the Emperor of Monomotapa with a request for permission to attack a people called the Mongas, whose territory lay between the Portuguese and the mines. The emperor granted Barreto permission to attack them and even went so far to offer his own men. Barreto, however, declined assistance, and marched onward upriver.&lt;ref name=kerr453455&gt;Kerr, pp. 453-455.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese fought several battles against the Mongas, victorious in all of them despite the overwhelming numbers due to their guns. According to Kerr, when their king sent ambassadors to Barreto in hopes of securing a peace, the soldier tricked them into thinking that the [[camel]]s used by the Portuguese, creatures foreign to southeastern Africa, subsisted on flesh, leading the Mongas to provide the Portuguese with beef for the camels.&lt;ref name=kerr453455/&gt;

Before the expedition could further progress Barreto was recalled to the [[Island of Mozambique]] to deal with one António Pereira Brandão, who was spreading false information about Barreto. The governor removed him from duty as commander of the São Sebastião fort, and returned to Sena where his men were waiting.&lt;ref name=kerr453455/&gt; At this point, however, many of the men were sick with tropical diseases, and Barreto too fell ill. He died at Sena on July 9, 1573,&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9013474/Francisco-Barreto |title =Francisco Barreto |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc]] |location=Chicago |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; having never reached the mines, and was buried at the Igreja de São Lourenço in Lisbon alongside his wife, Brites de Ataíde.&lt;ref name=ipv/&gt;

==Homem continues the search==
Barreto's deputy, [[Vasco Fernandes Homem]], succeeded him as governor and returned with the remaining company to the coast. After Monclaros had left for Lisbon, the expedition to Manica was resumed via the Sofala route. The mines, when finally reached, did not resemble the legends, with the natives only producing very small amounts of gold. After further failure looking for different mines in a neighboring kingdom, Homem abandoned the search for gold.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, pp. 456-458&lt;/ref&gt;
