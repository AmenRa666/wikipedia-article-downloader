'''USS ''Bulkeley'' (DDG 84)''' is an {{sclass/core|Arleigh Burke|destroyer||||format=sclass-}} in the [[United States Navy]]. She is named for Medal of Honor recipient Vice Admiral [[John D. Bulkeley]]. This ship is the 34th destroyer of its class. USS ''Bulkeley'' was the 15th ship of this class to be built at [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]] in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]], and construction began on 10 May 1999. She was launched on 21 June 2000 and was christened on 24 June 2000. On 8 December 2001 she was commissioned during a pierside ceremony at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in [[New York City|New York City, New York]]. USS ''Bulkeley'' is currently homeported at [[Naval Station Norfolk]], Virginia.

==History==
On 13 June 2004, ''Bulkeley'' came to the aid of a vessel in distress, ''Al-Rashid Mum 131''. Shortly after turning the vessel over to an Iranian tugboat, it sank. ''Bulkeley'' rescued three crew and recovered the body of a fourth. The tug rescued one additional crewman; the other seven were lost at sea. The incident is recounted in the book &quot;In the Shadow of Greatness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gergen|first1=the U.S. Naval Academy Class of 2002 ; [edited by] Joshua Welle ... [et al.] ; foreword by David|title=In the Shadow of Greatness: Voices of Leadership, Sacrifice, and Service from America's Longest War|date=2012|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Md.|isbn=978-1612511382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, ''Bulkeley'' was involved in a [[Quest Incident|mission]] to rescue four American citizens from the [[yacht]] ''Quest'' which was attacked by [[Somali pirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41715530/ns/world_news-africa/t/four-american-hostages-killed-somali-pirates/|title=4 American hostages killed by Somali pirates |work=msnbc.com |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2011, ''Bulkeley'' was involved in rescuing a Japanese oil tanker, {{MV|Guanabara}}, from Somali pirates while on duty with [[Combined Task Force 151]] off the coast of [[Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/06/africa.pirates.foiled/index.html?hpt=T2 |title=U.S. Navy frees ship from suspected Indian Ocean pirates |accessdate=20 June 2015 |date=6 March 2011 |work=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629183932/http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/06/africa.pirates.foiled/index.html?hpt=T2 |archivedate=29 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the pirates were tried and convicted in Japan, the fourth was turned over to juvenile authorities, as it was determined that he was a minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 3 pirates indicted over attack on Japan-run tanker in Indian Ocean  |url= http://www.japantoday.com/category/crime/view/3-pirates-to-be-indicted-over-attack-on-japan-run-tanker-in-indian-ocean   |newspaper= Japan Today|date= 1 April 2011|accessdate=3 April 2011}} {{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2011 ''Bulkeley'' responded to a mayday call from the Panamanian flagged [[very large crude carrier]] ''Artemis Glory'' by dispatching a [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|Seahawk]] helicopter (from HSL 48) to its position. Seeing that a piratical skiff carrying four men was firing upon  ''Artemis Glory'', the Seahawk investigated the skiff. The pirates opened fire on the helicopter with small arms and were summarily neutralized by crew served weapons from the helicopter in self-defense. The helicopter then withdrew without any casualties to its own crewmembers or that of  ''Artemis Glory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://combinedmaritimeforces.com/2011/05/17/uss-bulkeley-protects-mv-artemis-glory-from-pirate-attack/|title=USS Bulkeley Protects MV Artemis Glory From Pirate Attack|work=Combined Maritime Forces |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship returned to Norfolk on 15 July 2011. During its deployment, it had participated in operations which had captured 75 Somali pirates and had missile strikes by its carrier strike group against the Libyan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Todd Allen |title=USS Enterprise Returns To Norfolk |work=[[Newport News Daily Press]] |date=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coat of Arms ==
[[File:USS Bulkeley DDG-84 Crest.png|left|thumb]]

=== Shield ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The shield has background of blue and a medium blue trim. A red chevron with anchors surround a lion in the center of the shield, with a reversed star below.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The inverted star at the shield base refers to the Medal of Honor Admiral Bulkeley received for his forcefulness and daringness during the defense of the Philippines. The hallmarks of USS ''Bulkeley'', honor and high achievement, are represented in the gold wreath. From the family coat of arms, the red chevron represents the valor and sacrifice displayed by Admiral Bulkeley when he led a flotilla of PT boats and minesweepers to Utah Beach before troops stormed the beach at Normandy. The lion indicates the heritage of Normandy and represents courage and strength. Silver anchors surround the lion to display the U.S. Navy sailors’ devotion and commitment while defending the countries freedom, keeping USS ''Bulkeley'' and the United States Navy “Second to None.”

=== Crest ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Philippine sun surrounds a Patrol Torpedo boat parting waves of the sea.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;A PT boat from World War II is surrounded by the Philippine sun shows honor to Admiral Bulkeley’s role in the Pacific. This includes the daring rescue of General MacArthur and Philippine President Quezon from the Battle of Corregidor.

=== Motto ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The motto is written on a scroll of gold with blue trim.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;The ships motto is &quot;Freedom's Torch&quot;. The motto is a reference to both the honorable feats of Admiral Bulkeley and the Medal of Honor he received.

=== Seal ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS Bulkely&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 84&quot; in the base all gold.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
