'''Antoni  Wladyslaw Kiewnarski''' (26 January 1899&amp;nbsp;– 31 March 1944) known as “Tony” was a Polish [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber “Observer and Captain” flying from England when he was taken prisoner during the [[Second World War]]. He is notable for the part he took in the 'Great Escape' from [[Stalag Luft III]] in March 1944 and as one of the men recaptured and subsequently shot by the ''[[Gestapo]]''.

==Early life==
Kiewnarski was born in [[Moscow]], Russia. He enlisted in the [[Polish Army]] in August 1917 and served with distinction in three wars, [[World War I]], the [[Polish-Soviet War]] and [[World War II]] transferring to the [[Polish Air Force]] and rising through the ranks to Senior Sergeant and later commissioned officer.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2001),  p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==War service==
[[File:Roundel of Poland (until 1993).svg|border|left|75px]]
After the German and Soviet invasions of Poland in September 1939 Kiewnarski travelled to France and later to England to continue the fight against the occupiers of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Sikorksi Institute, London. Polish Air Force index card – A Kiewnarski&lt;/ref&gt;   In England Kiewnarski continued to fly and became a [[flight lieutenant]] in the [[Free Polish Air Force]] serving with [[No. 305 Polish Bomber Squadron]] flying [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers from [[RAF Ingham]].  He was an “Observer” (the aircrew role of Navigator /Bomb Aimer) and in command of the aircraft and its crew. He survived a serious crash on the night of 17 – 18  April 1942 when his crew were flying [[Vickers Wellington]] (serial number W5566) tasked with bombing Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;Chorley (1994), p.74&lt;/ref&gt; They had to drop their bombs in the area of Tierschelling because of engine trouble and had to make their return flight on only one engine. While attempting to land at [[RAF Lindholme]] the aircraft collided with another Wellington which was parked on the ground. Five of the Polish crew in W5566 were slightly injured and the tail gunner escaped injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkshire-aircraft.co.uk/aircraft/yorkshire/york42/w5566.html  Yorkshire aircraft website - Kiewnarski]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vickers Wellington Mk2.jpg|thumb|right|The Merlin-engined Wellington Mark II. This aircraft actually belongs to [[No. 104 Squadron RAF|No. 104 Sqn.]]]]

==Prisoner of war==
Kiewnarski was in command of [[Vickers Wellington]] Mark IV (squadron codes SM-D, serial number “Z1245”) on the night 27 – 28 August 1942 attacking the German target at Kassel. His aircraft was shot down by a German night fighter near [[Eindhoven]] when three of the crew were killed. He and his wireless operator [[sergeant]] Frankowski were captured by the Germans, Frankowski was wounded and after treatment managed to escape and return to England. Kiewnarski went straight into the prison camp system as prison of war number 42,801.&lt;ref&gt;Chorley (1994), p.195 and 312&lt;/ref&gt;
He ended up in prisoner of war camp [[Stalag Luft III]] in the province of Lower Silesia near the town of [[Sagan, Germany|Sagan]] (now [[Żagań]] in [[Poland]]). In prison camp he was regarded as the elder statesman of the Polish prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.127&lt;/ref&gt;

=='Great Escape'==
Kiewnarski was one of the 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24–25 March 1944 in the escape now famous as &quot;[[Stalag Luft III|the Great Escape]]&quot;. The initial groups out of the tunnel were those who needed a head start in order to get to the local railway station and catch their appropriate trains. He was in the first group of “walkers” who followed, they were led by Williy Williams and posed as a band of lumber mill workers on leave and included Australian [[Reginald Kierath|Rusty Kierath]], Canadian Jim Wernham and Pole [[Kazimierz Pawluk|Kaz Pawluk]]. 
[[File:The50Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial to &quot;The Fifty&quot; down the road toward Żagań (Kiewnarski at right)]]
In a filthy cold night they headed east towards the railway lines and then south to Tschiebsdorf railway station where [[Jerzy Mondschein]] used a forged travel pass to buy tickets for the group of twelve on the 6AM train to Boberrohrsdorf three hours south where they split up.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.190&lt;/ref&gt;  Kiewnarski and Kaz Pawluk arrived in Hirschberg (now  [[Jelenia Gora]] ) but while walking through the town during the afternoon were arrested and interrogated in the town police station before being held in the local jail with other recaptured escapees.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.47-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.237 and 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.190-191 and p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 29 March 1944 Jim Wernham and Nick Skantzikas were removed from the cell and then during the afternoon Doug Poynter and Pop Green. Two days later on the morning of 31 March 1944 [[Kazimierz Pawluk|Kaz Pawluk]] and Kiewnarski were taken away. They were shot near Hirschberg (now [[Jelenia Gora]] )&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000) p.256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.186-189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.242&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegasusarchive.org/pow/cSL_3_Fifty.htm|work=Pegasus Archive|title=Stalag Luft III: The Fifty|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kiewnarski was one of the 50 escapers who had been listed by [[SS]]-Gruppenfuhrer [[Arthur Nebe]] to be killed&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.34&lt;/ref&gt;  so was amongst the those [[Stalag Luft III murders|executed and murdered]] by the ''Gestapo''. The place he was cremated is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanski (2012), p.497&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.129 and 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.48 and 206&lt;/ref&gt; His remains are now buried in part of the Poznan Old Garrison Cemetery where his headstone shows the rank [[major]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prinsesirenebrigade.nl/laatstenieuws.htm  Antoni Kiewnarski headstone]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=26754394  Find-a-grave - Antoni Kiewnarski]&lt;/ref&gt;
Kiewnarski is commemorated on the [[Polish Air Force]] Memorial at [[Northolt]], [[Middlesex]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polishwargraves.nl/info/mem.northolt.2007.pdf   Northolt Memorial PDF file – A W Kiewnarski]&lt;/ref&gt;
His name was on the list of murdered officers which was published by newspapers on 20 May 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Western Morning News, Dundee Courier, Yorkshire Post, etc. 20/05/1944&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Awards==
His conspicuous bravery as a prisoner was recognized by a [[Mention in Despatches]] as none of the other relevant decorations then available could be awarded posthumously.

==Other victims==
{{main article||Stalag Luft III murders}}

The ''Gestapo'' executed a group of 50 of the recaptured prisoners representing almost all of the nationalities involved in the escape. Post-war investigations saw a number of those guilty of the murders tracked down, arrested and tried for their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), pp.294–297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.182-183 and p.186-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/03-04-46.asp  Yale Avalon Project-War Crimes Trial Part 8 – victim Kiewnarski]&lt;/ref&gt;
