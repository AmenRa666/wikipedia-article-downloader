'''USCGC ''Point Chico'' (WPB-82339)''' was an {{convert|82|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Point class cutter]] constructed at the [[United States Coast Guard Yard|Coast Guard Yard]] at [[Curtis Bay, Maryland]] in 1962 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1962 was not to name [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] under {{convert|100|ft|m|}} in length, it was designated as ''WPB-82339'' when commissioned and acquired the name ''Point Chico'' in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than {{convert|65|ft|m|}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina72&gt;Scheina, p 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and design details==
''Point Chico'' was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.&lt;ref name=Scheina71&gt;Scheina, p 71&lt;/ref&gt; She was powered by two {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT800 [[Cummins]] diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed {{convert|42|inch|m|abbr=on}} propellers. Water tank capacity was {{convert|1550|gal|liters|}} and fuel tank capacity was {{convert|1840|gal|liters|}} at 95% full.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina71&gt;Scheina, p 71&lt;/ref&gt; After 1990 she was refit with {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[Caterpillar, Inc.|Caterpillar]] diesel main drive engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt; Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The design specifications for ''Point Chico'' included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer [[Watch system|watch]] in the engine room.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Propeller|screw]]s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt; Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a [[ship floodability|watertight door]] on the [[starboard side]] aft of the [[deckhouse]]. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt; The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, [[scuttlebutt]], a small desk and [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], [[mess]] and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After commissioning, ''Point Chico'' was stationed at [[Sausalito, California]], from 1963 to 1965 where she was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. On 14 June 1965 she escorted the damaged FV ''Salmon Queen'' from eighteen miles southwest of [[Point Bonita Light|Point Bonita]], California to Sausalito. In 1966 her homeport was shifted to [[Benicia, California]] where she helped fight a barge fire in [[San Francisco]] harbor on 26 September 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;

In 1974 ''Point Chico'' was transferred to [[Yerba Buena Island]]. She and her crew were awarded the [[Coast Guard Unit Commendation]] for her part in fighting a fire that engulfed Pier 37 at the Port of San Francisco's [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] and saving the historic ferry boat ''San Leandro''.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=SFC&gt;{{cite news|last=Fimrite|first=Peter|title=SAN FRANCISCO BAY / Ferry tale|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-BAY-Ferry-tale-the-dream-dies-2638663.php|work=SFGate, Thursday, April 28, 2005|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=13 August 2012|date=28 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a second unit commendation for rescue and relief operations during flooding of the [[Noyo River]] basin in October 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt; On 7 April 1980 she towed the disabled {{convert|633|ft|m|adj=on}}  tanker ''Austin'' into the wind 35 miles northwest of [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]], buying time for engineers working on damaged wiring as the tanker drifted toward the [[Piedras Blancas Light Station|Piedras Blancas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina73&gt;Scheina, p 73&lt;/ref&gt;

After 4 August 1980 ''Point Chico'' was stationed at [[Bodega Bay, California]]. On 9 September 1983, she towed the disabled pleasure craft ''Sabra'' into San Francisco. On 16 September, she towed the disabled FV ''Huyne Long'' from off [[Farallon Island]] to San Francisco. On 8 November she rescued two divers off [[Mendocino, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina73&gt;Scheina, p 73&lt;/ref&gt;

''Point Chico'' received her third unit commendation for participation in the Olympic Security Task Force during the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] held at [[Los Angeles, California]] from 7 July to 15 August 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt; She was awarded the [[Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for search and rescue and law enforcement operations from 1 January to 9 April 1985. when her crew seized the FV ''Oregon Beaver'' with {{convert|45000|lb|kg}} of [[marijuana]] on board. On 7 June 1985, ''Point Chico'' was adopted as the official Coast Guard cutter of the [[Sacramento, California|City of Sacramento]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;

''Point Chico'' was decommissioned 24 June 2001 and transferred to Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;
