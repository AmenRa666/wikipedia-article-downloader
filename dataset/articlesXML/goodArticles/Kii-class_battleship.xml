The '''''Kii''-class battleship''' was a planned [[ship class|class]] of four [[fast battleship]]s to be built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the 1920s. Only two of the ships received names. They were intended to reinforce Japan's &quot;[[eight-eight fleet]]&quot; of eight battleships and eight [[battlecruiser]]s after the United States announced a major naval construction program in 1919. However, after the signing of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] in 1922, work on the ships was suspended; one pair was cancelled in November 1923 and the other in April 1924.

==Design and background==
{{main|Eight-eight fleet}}
[[File:Yuzuru Hiraga.JPG|left|thumb|[[Yuzuru Hiraga]]|150px]]
By 1918, the Navy had gained approval for an &quot;eight-six&quot; fleet of eight battleships and six battlecruisers, all ships under eight years old. However, having four large battleships (two each of the {{sclass-|Nagato|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Tosa|battleship|4}}es) and four {{sclass-|Amagi|battlecruiser|2}}s on order put an enormous financial strain on Japan, which was spending about a third of its national budget on the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the IJN gained approval of the &quot;eight-eight-eight&quot; plan in 1920 after American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] announced plans in 1919 to re-initiate the 1916 plan for ten additional battleships and six battlecruisers. The Japanese response was to plan the construction of eight additional fast battleships in the ''Kii'' and the Number 13 classes.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Peattie, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Yuzuru Hiraga]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's232&quot;&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Kii'' class was based largely on the preceding {{sclass-|Amagi|battlecruiser}}s, which were in turn based on a less-armored ''Tosa''-class design.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's235&quot;&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; The only major difference between the ''Kii''s and ''Amagi''s was their speed and armor&amp;mdash;the ''Amagi''s were {{convert|.25|kn}} faster, and the ''Kii''s had a thicker [[belt armor|belt]]. Despite this lineage, the ''Kii''s were classified as &quot;fast battleships&quot; by the Japanese, as they had decided to end the distinction between &quot;battleship&quot; and &quot;battlecruiser.&quot;&lt;ref name=b6&gt;Breyer, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description===
The ships had a length of {{convert|234.9|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|250.1|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|30.8|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|9.7|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The normal [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] of the battleships was {{convert|42600|t|LT|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

The class was intended to be equipped with four Gijutsu-Hombu geared [[steam turbine]]s, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|131200|shp|lk=in}}, using steam provided by 19 Kampon oil-fired [[water-tube boiler]]s, to reach a maximum speed of {{convert|29.75|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jentschura, Jung &amp; Mickel, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary armament of the ''Kii'' class was ten 45-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[41 cm/45 3rd Year Type naval gun|41-centimeter]] guns in five twin-[[gun turrets]], two fore and three aft of the [[superstructure]].&lt;ref name=b6&gt;Breyer, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; This gun fired a {{convert|1000|kg|lb|sp=us|adj=on}} shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|790|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary battery consisted of 16 single 50-caliber [[14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval gun|14-centimeter guns]] was mounted in [[casemate]]s in the superstructure. The manually operated guns had a maximum range of {{convert|19750|m|yd|sp=us}} at an elevation of +35° and fired at a rate up to 10 rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; The ships' anti-aircraft defenses consisted of four single 45-caliber [[12 cm/45 10th Year Type naval gun|12-centimeter 10th Year Type]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s mounted around the single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]].&lt;ref name=b6/&gt; Each of these guns had a maximum elevation of +75° and a maximum rate of fire of 10–11 rounds per minute. They could fire a {{convert|20.41|kg|lb|adj=on|sp=us}} projectile with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|825|-|830|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to a maximum height of {{convert|10000|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kii'' class was also fitted with eight {{convert|61|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s, four on each [[broadside]].&lt;ref name=b6/&gt;

The ships would have been protected by a [[waterline]] belt of armor {{convert|293|mm|in|0|sp=us}} thick, sloped 15° outwards at the top to increase its ability to resist penetration at short range. The belt armor was designed to be able to defeat {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} shells from a distance of {{convert|12000|–|20000|m|yards|sp=us}}. The main battery turrets and barbettes would have had between {{convert|280|-|229|mm|in|0|sp=us}} of armor plating, and the [[conning tower]] would have had been protected by armor {{convert|356|mm|in|0|sp=us}} thick. The decks would have been {{convert|120|mm|in|0|sp=us}} thick. The ''Kii''-class battleships would have had a [[torpedo bulkhead]] {{convert|75|mm|in|0|sp=us}} thick, which connected at the top to a {{convert|38|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} splinter deck beneath the main deck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's232&quot;/&gt;

==Construction==
Two ships were ordered on 12 October 1921, and two more were ordered later that year. ''Kii'' was allocated to [[Kure Naval Arsenal]], [[Kure]], with a projected completion date of November 1923, and ''Owari'' was allocated to the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]], [[Yokosuka]], with completion in September.&lt;ref name=b6/&gt; Two more unnamed ships, Numbers 11 and 12, were assigned to [[Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation|Kawasaki]] in [[Kobe]] and [[Mitsubishi]] in [[Nagasaki]], respectively. The ships' [[keel|keel laying]] was stopped on 5 February because the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty that forbade the construction of all battleships over {{convert|35000|LT|t}}. Numbers 11 and 12 were formally canceled on 19 November 1923; ''Kii'' and ''Owari'' followed on 14 April 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's232&quot;/&gt;
