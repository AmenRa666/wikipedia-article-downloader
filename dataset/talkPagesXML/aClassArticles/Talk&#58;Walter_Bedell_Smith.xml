== Article copied ==
This article was simply copied fromt the Arlington National Cemetery website (link at bottom of article). &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:198.37.17.162|198.37.17.162]] ([[User talk:198.37.17.162|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/198.37.17.162|contribs]]) 17:57, November 6, 2005 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Relation to author Sally Bedell Smith? ==
I noticed there is a rather prolific biography writer [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/104-7733137-6275950?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Sally%20Bedell%20Smith] named Sally Bedell Smith.  Does anyone know if she is related (granddaughter?) to Walter Bedell Smith?  If so, and if we have a good reference, it should be part of the article. --[[User:Rogerd|rogerd]] 14:40, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

Walter Bedell Smith had no children  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:93Stroud|93Stroud]] ([[User talk:93Stroud|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/93Stroud|contribs]]) 17:08, 19 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Probably no relation - Sally Bedell Smith was born Sally Bedell; the Smith is her married name. [[User:Andrew Gray|Andrew Gray]] ([[User talk:Andrew Gray|talk]]) 21:35, 14 August 2012 (UTC)

== Why is there a set of links to Medal of Honor recipients, when he was not one? ==
My question is done more out of ignorance than anything.  I cannot find anything saying he was a recipient, but I may not have searched enough.  Perhaps he was the son of a recipient.  My question stands for the moment.  [[User:Uel|UEL]] 03:11, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

I did not see the Medal of Honor link.  He received other medals listed in the article.  He gave the brief introduction in the movie &quot;To Hell and Back,&quot; about and starring Medal of Honor winner Audie Murphy.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:93Stroud|93Stroud]] ([[User talk:93Stroud|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/93Stroud|contribs]]) 17:16, 19 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Born and raised where? ==
The article doesn't say. - [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] | [[User talk:Jmabel|Talk]] 19:48, 13 November 2007 (UTC)

Indianapolis, Indiana  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:93Stroud|93Stroud]] ([[User talk:93Stroud|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/93Stroud|contribs]]) 17:13, 19 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Inappropriate to Blame Smith for Segregation in the Armed Forces ==
It is not appropriate to blame Smith for segregation in the armed forces.  As difficult as it may be for persons now living to believe, back then, segregation was merely a way of life.  It was no different to them than restrooms marked &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot; are for us today.  As the article points out, segregation existed in the Pacific Theatre, and Smith had nothing to do with that.  If racial integration had been attempted during the Second World War, it would have provoked sharp protest from the South and from other parts of the country.  Whatever President Roosevelt's personal views on the matter may have been, he realized that it was not worth endangering the war effort to press for an end to segregation.  Indeed, segregation in the armed forces was not eliminated until 1948, when President Truman issued his executive order.  The fact that Truman favored integration caused him a great deal of political trouble and resulted in a split in the Democratic party, when J. Strom Thurmond and his supporters pulled out and created the &quot;Dixiecrat&quot; political party.

I think the section about segregation should be removed.

== Active role in excluding African soldiers from liberation of Paris ==
I would expect that the General's mandate that the French forces be &quot;100% white&quot; during the liberation of Paris be addressed in the article.  Here is a link to the BBC article:

[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7984436.stm Paris liberation made 'whites only']  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.27.242.106|75.27.242.106]] ([[User talk:75.27.242.106|talk]]) 14:25, 6 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:The only thing the article says about him specificlly is that he wrote a memo recommending that blacks be removed from the units, I have changed the articles entry to say that specificlly. I think it would be helpful to put it in context and determine why that was his position, or even if it was his position, or and order from a higher commander.

== Post nominal ==
I notice that GBE KCB have been added after his name. Is it usual for US citizens to add UK awards after their names? I've looked at other high ranked generals of the era. They surely must have been awarded some UK distinctions but don't have the post nominals in use. Any ideas? [[User:Ozdaren|Ozdaren]] ([[User talk:Ozdaren|talk]]) 22:23, 8 May 2010 (UTC)
* It is not usual. Removed. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 01:40, 21 August 2010 (UTC)

== References? ==
The notes regularly refer to &quot;Pogue 1954&quot;, but there's no work by Pogue in the references. [[User:Shimgray|Shimgray]] | [[User talk:Shimgray|talk]] | 15:54, 5 September 2010 (UTC)
* It is there now. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 20:31, 5 September 2010 (UTC)
