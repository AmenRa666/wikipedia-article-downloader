The '''34th Armoured Brigade''' was an [[Armoured warfare|armoured]] [[brigade]] of the [[British Army]] that saw active service in [[World War II]]. It was formed in 1941 as the '''34th Army Tank Brigade''' and subsequently redesignated as the '''34th Tank Brigade''' in February 1945 and became part of the [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|79th Armoured Division]]. It was equipped with [[Churchill tank]]s and provided close support for assaults by the [[infantry]]. During the fighting in [[Western Front (World War II)|North-west Europe]] from July 1944 to May 1945 the brigade served with both the [[First Canadian Army]] and the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]]. The brigade was disbanded in early 1946.&lt;ref name=34arm&gt;{{cite web | title= THE HISTORY of 34 ARMOURED BRIGADE | url= http://www.royaltankregiment.com/9_RTR/History%20of%2034%20Armd%20Bde.htm | accessdate= 8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The brigade was formed on 1 December 1941 as one of ten [[Brigade group|independent]] Army Tank brigades to be equipped with [[Churchill tank]]s. In June 1942, the word &quot;Army&quot; was dropped from the brigade's title and it became part of the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Mixed Infantry Division]]. The 34th Tank Brigade was transferred to the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division|43rd Mixed Infantry Division]] in September 1942 and in September 1943 it returned to independent status (attached to [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]]), when the concept of mixed divisions was abandoned.&lt;ref name=34arm/&gt;

The first two and half years of the brigade's existence were spent in training in the south of England and it saw its first active service in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy bridgehead]].&lt;ref name=34arm/&gt;

Advance parties departed to Normandy on D + 10 (16 June) but the entire brigade was not gathered together in France until early July 1944. Its first combat was in support of the [[15th (Scottish) Infantry Division]] in [[Operation Greenline]] from 15 to 18 July, to enlarge the [[Odon (river)|Odon]] bridgehead and advance beyond [[Operation Jupiter (1944)|Hill 112]]; the German opposition held a strong position and [[153rd Regiment Royal Armoured Corps]] suffered particularly severe casualties, including its commanding officer. Overall, the brigade lost 30 [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and 156 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]] in this action. The brigade continued in active service in Normandy until late August.&lt;ref name=34arm/&gt;

After a 14-day rest and reorganisation and now under the [[First Canadian Army]], the brigade crossed the River Seine on 4 September to prepare to [[Operation Astonia|assault Le Havre]]. On arrival outside Le Havre on 6 September, the brigade came under command of [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]], who were to assault Le Havre from the north east and east. The defenders' morale was low despite impressive defence works and victory was completed on 12 September with minimal casualties. A troop of [[7th Royal Tank Regiment]], without infantry, had entered the fort at 11:30am and had captured Oberst [[Hermann-Eberhard Wildermuth]], the Garrison Commander, his whole staff and 400 [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]].&lt;ref name=34arm/&gt;

Around this time, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies' supply lines were under great stress due to the lack of usable ports and the brigade's transport was added to the supply chain for the front line in Belgium. The brigade as such was effectively grounded and out of action. By 18 September, the Brigade was concentrated about midway between Dieppe and Rouen. On 29 September. still lacking its transport, the brigade's 300 Churchills (including a delivery squadron), heavily loaded with munitions, moved on tracks northwards for three days to Desvres, near Boulogne. On 2 October, one regiment, 7th Royal Tank Regiment, was detached to assist the [[Siege of Dunkirk (1944–45)|containment of Dunkirk]] by [[51st (Highland) Division|51st (Highland) Infantry Division]], where it took an active and successful part in the siege.&lt;ref name=34arm/&gt;

By 6 October, the brigade had reached the Eindhoven area and all regiments were immediately deployed into the front line.&lt;ref name=34arm/&gt;

In February, 1945, the 34th Armoured Brigade provided armoured support to infantry units, mainly the [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]], during the [[Operation Veritable|Battle of the Reichswald]], in ground conditions that caused more damage to its tanks than the enemy.

After the [[Operation Plunder|Rhine crossings]], the brigade saw no further active service in Europe and was in preparation for transfer to [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South-East Asian theatre]] when the war ended.

==Commanders==
The 34th Armoured Brigade had just two commanding officers: [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)| Brigadier]] [[James Noel Tetley|J. N. Tetley]] until June 1943 (left to command [[25th Tank Brigade]]) and then Brigadier W. S. Clarke, who commanded the brigade until it was disbanded in 1946.
