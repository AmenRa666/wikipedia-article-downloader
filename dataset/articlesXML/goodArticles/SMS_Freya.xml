'''SMS ''Freya''''' was a [[protected cruiser]] of the {{sclass-|Victoria Louise|cruiser|4}}, built for the German [[Imperial German Navy|Imperial Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine'') in the 1890s, along with her [[sister ship]]s {{SMS|Victoria Louise||2}}, {{SMS|Hertha||2}}, {{SMS|Vineta|1897|2}}, and {{SMS|Hansa|1898|2}}. ''Freya'' was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Danzig|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Danzig]] in 1895, launched in April 1897, and commissioned into the Navy in October 1898. The ship was armed with a battery of two 21&amp;nbsp;cm guns and eight 15&amp;nbsp;cm guns and had a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}.

''Freya'' served in the German fleet for the initial years of her career, unlike her sister ships, all of which served abroad on foreign stations. As a result, she led a fairly uneventful career in the fleet. After a modernization in 1905&amp;ndash;1907, ''Freya'' was used as a [[school ship]] for cadets. At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''Freya'' was mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty only briefly. She was used as a [[barracks ship]] after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1921.

''Freya'' was ordered under the contract name &quot;''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Freya|1874|2}}&quot; and was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Danzig|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Danzig]] in 1895.&lt;ref name=G47&gt;Gröner, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; She was launched on 27 April 1897, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the German navy on 20 October 1898.&lt;ref name=G48&gt;Gröner, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was {{convert|110.6|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.4|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.58|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|6491|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of three vertical 4-cylinder  [[triple expansion engine]]s powered by twelve coal-fired [[Belleville boiler]]s. Her engines provided a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|abbr=on}} and a range of approximately {{convert|3412|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|abbr=on}}. She had a crew of 31&amp;nbsp;officers and 446&amp;nbsp;enlisted men.&lt;ref name=G478&gt;Gröner, pp. 47&amp;ndash;48&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was armed with two [[21 cm SK L/40 gun|21&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/40]] guns in single turrets, one forward and one aft. The guns were supplied with 58&amp;nbsp;rounds of ammunition each. They had a range of {{convert|16300|m|abbr=on}}. ''Vineta'' also carried eight [[15 cm SK L/40|15&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/40]] guns. Four were mounted in turrets amidships and the other four were placed in [[casemate]]s. These guns had a range of {{convert|13700|m|abbr=on}}. She also carried ten [[8.8 cm SK L/35]] guns.&lt;ref name=G47/&gt; The gun armament was rounded out by machine guns.&lt;ref name=G254&gt;Gardiner, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; She was also equipped with three {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s with eight torpedoes, two launchers were mounted on the [[broadside]] and the third was in the bow, all below the waterline.&lt;ref name=G47/&gt;

==Service history==
After her commissioning, ''Freya'' served with the German fleet.&lt;ref name=G48/&gt; On 1 September 1902, ''Freya'' joined the Cruiser Division of the I Squadron of the German home fleet. The Division consisted of the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Prinz Heinrich||2}}, the [[flagship]], {{SMS|Victoria Louise||2}}, and the light cruisers {{SMS|Hela||2}}, {{SMS|Amazone|1900|2}}, and {{SMS|Niobe||2}}. The Division participated in the summer fleet maneuvers of August&amp;ndash;September 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, ''Freya'' went into drydock at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Wilhelmshaven]] for modernization. During the refit she was re-boilered; she had been built originally with three stacks, and during the modernization they were trunked into two funnels. The refit was finished in 1907, after which ''Freya'' was used as a [[school ship|training ship]] for naval cadets.&lt;ref name=G478/&gt;

In 1907, [[Günther Lütjens]] served aboard the ship as a cadet; Lütjens went on to command the task force composed of {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;von Müllenheim-Rechberg, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1908, ''Freya'' represented Germany at celebrations in [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], Canada, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Canadian Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Colby, p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; While entering the port at around midnight on 9 August, she inadvertently rammed a [[schooner]] in heavy fog. Nine sailors were killed in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;Hadley &amp; Sarty, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

''Freya'' had a short career during [[World War I]]. At the outbreak of hostilities, she was briefly mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the [[Baltic Sea]]. By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service.&lt;ref name=GG142&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; She was then put into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and returned to service as a training ship based in [[Flensburg]]. She served in this capacity through to the end of the war.&lt;ref name=G48/&gt; In 1915, [[Bernhard Rogge]], who would go on to command the raider [[German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis|''Atlantis'']] during World War II, served aboard the ship as a cadet.&lt;ref&gt;Slavick, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The old [[aviso]] {{SMS|Grille||2}} became ''Freya''{{'}}s tender starting in July 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Gröner, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; She was stricken on 25 January 1920 and used briefly as a [[barracks ship]] for police in [[Hamburg]]. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]] in 1921.&lt;ref name=G48/&gt;
