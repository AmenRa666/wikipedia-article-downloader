'''HMS ''Blonde''''' was the [[lead ship]] of the [[Blonde-class cruiser|her class]] of [[scout cruiser]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the first decade of the 20th century. She led the [[7th Destroyer Flotilla (United Kingdom)|7th Destroyer Flotilla]] in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from completion until 1912. The ship was temporarily assigned to the [[1st Destroyer Flotilla (United Kingdom)|1st Destroyer Flotilla]] before she joined the [[4th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|4th Battle Squadron]] in 1913. During the [[World War I|First World War]], ''Blonde'' was assigned to various [[battleship]] [[squadron (naval)|squadron]]s of the [[Grand Fleet]]. The ship was converted into a [[minelayer]] in 1917, but never actually laid any [[naval mine|mines]]. She was reduced to [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in 1919 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1920.

==Design and description==
Designed to provide [[destroyer]] [[flotilla]]s with a [[command ship]] capable of outclassing enemy destroyers with her 10 {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|0|spell=in}} guns, ''Blonde'' proved too slow in service from the start of her career. Her {{convert|25|kn|adj=on|lk=in}} speed was inadequate to match the {{convert|27|to|30|kn|adj=on}} speeds of the destroyers she led in her flotilla.&lt;ref name=gg0&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Displacement (ship)|Displacing]] {{convert|3350|LT|t}},&lt;ref name=gg0/&gt; the ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|406|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|41|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a deep [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|14|ft|3|in|m|1}}. She was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one shaft. The turbines produced a total of {{convert|18000|ihp|lk=in}}, using steam produced by 12 [[Yarrow boiler]]s, and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|25|kn}}. She carried a maximum of {{convert|780|LT|t}} of coal and {{convert|189|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]].&lt;ref name=f5&gt;Friedman 2009, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew consisted of 314 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=gg0/&gt;

Her main armament consisted of 10 [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading (BL)]] [[BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VII|four-inch Mk VII guns]]. The forward pair of guns were mounted side by side on a platform on the [[forecastle]], three pairs were [[port and starboard]] [[amidships]], and the two remaining guns were on the centreline of the [[quarterdeck]], one ahead of the other.&lt;ref name=gg0/&gt; The guns fired their {{convert|31|lb|adj=on}} shells to a range of about {{convert|11400|yd}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2011, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; Her secondary armament was four [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[Ordnance QF 3-pounder Vickers|three-pounder ({{convert|47|mm|in|abbr=on}}) Vickers Mk I gun]]s and two submerged {{convert|21|in|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=gg0/&gt;

As a scout cruiser, the ship was only lightly protected to maximize her speed. She had a curved protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] that was {{convert|1|in|mm|0|spell=in}} thick on the slope and {{convert|.5|in}} on the flat.&lt;ref name=f5/&gt; Her [[conning tower]] was protected by four inches of armour.&lt;ref name=gg0/&gt;

==Construction and service== 
''Blonde'', the eighth and last ship of that name,&lt;ref name=c5/&gt; was [[Keel|laid down]] on No. 5 [[Slipway]]&lt;ref name=p7/&gt; at [[Pembroke Royal Dockyard]], on 6 December 1909&lt;ref name=gg0/&gt; and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 July 1910 by Lady Frances Williams, wife of [[Sir Osmond Williams, 1st Baronet]].&lt;ref name=p7&gt;Phillips, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; She was completed in May 1911&lt;ref name=gg0/&gt; with [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Thomas Bonham in command&lt;ref name=&quot;dn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=H.M.S. Blonde (1910)|url=http://www.dreadnoughtproject.org/tfs/index.php/H.M.S._Blonde_%281910%29|website=www.dreadnoughtproject.org|publisher=The Dreadnought Project|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the leader of the 7th Destroyer Flotilla in the [[Mediterranean]] through 1912.&lt;ref name=gg0/&gt; Captain Arthur Hulbert assumed command of the ship and the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the [[First Fleet (United Kingdom)|First Fleet]] on 10 May 1912. He was lost at sea on 12 January 1913 and replaced by Captain Thomas Shelford. He was relieved by Captain William Blunt on 25 April and transferred to the scout cruiser, {{HMS|Fearless|1912|2}}, when that ship was assigned to the flotilla.&lt;ref name=dn/&gt; The ship had been transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron as of 18 June&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Navy List|url=https://ia700804.us.archive.org/30/items/navylistjul1913grea/navylistjul1913grea.pdf|website=National Library of Scotland|date=18 June 1913|publisher=[[His Majesty's Stationery Office]]|location=London|accessdate=31 March 2016|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Captain Albert Scott assumed command on 5 July.&lt;ref name=dn/&gt;

The ship was still assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet in [[Scapa Flow]] at the start of the war in August 1914. Captain [[John Casement]] was in command 20 March–21 May 1916.&lt;ref name=dn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Vol. I, p. 439; Vol. II, pp. 412, 417&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blonde'' and the [[Flotilla leader]] {{HMS|Broke|1914|2}} were on patrol east of Scapa Flow when a depth charge carried by ''Blonde'' accidentally exploded., damaging here upper deck and killing two of her crew. The accident resulted in the type of depth charge carried by ''Blonde'', the Egerton Depth Charge, being withdrawn from use by the Grand Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Naval Staff Monograph No. 31, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was under refit in April 1916 and missed the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May–1 June 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Naval Staff Monograph No. 32, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Blonde'' was still detached in August.&lt;ref&gt;Newbolt, Vol. IV, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; By October, she had rejoined the 4th Battle Squadron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplement to the Monthly Navy List Showing the Organisation of the Fleet, Flag Officer's Commands, &amp;c.|url=https://ia700709.us.archive.org/21/items/navylistoct1916grea/navylistoct1916grea.pdf|website=National Library of Scotland|publisher=Admiralty|date=October 1916|accessdate=1 April 2016|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Captain Basil Brooke in command, but had been transferred to the [[1st Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battle Squadron]] by April 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplement to the Monthly Navy List Showing the Organisation of the Fleet, Flag Officer's Commands, &amp;c.|url=https://ia700709.us.archive.org/21/items/navylistapr1917grea/navylistapr1917grea.pdf|website=National Library of Scotland|publisher=Admiralty|date=May 1917|accessdate=1 April 2016|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain The Honourable [[Arthur Forbes-Sempill]] having assumed command in February. On 1 June, [[Commander]] [[Theodore Hallett]] relived Forbes-Semphill.&lt;ref name=dn/&gt; In September 1917, she was converted into a minelayer, but never laid any mines in combat.&lt;ref name=gg0/&gt; Hallett was relived by Captain Gregory Wood-Martin on 30 December and he retained command until 10 January 1919 when he was relieved in turn by Captain Maurice Evans.&lt;ref name=dn/&gt; ''Blonde'' was in reserve by February&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplement to the Monthly Navy List Showing the Organisation of the Fleet, Flag Officer's Commands, &amp;c.|url=https://ia700709.us.archive.org/21/items/navylistfeb1919grea/navylistfeb1919grea.pdf|website=National Library of Scotland|publisher=Admiralty|date=1 February 1919|accessdate=1 April 2016|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been assigned to the [[Nore]] Reserve by 1 May, together with her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|Blanche|1909|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplement to the Monthly Navy List Showing the Organisation of the Fleet, Flag Officer's Commands, &amp;c.|url=https://ia700709.us.archive.org/21/items/navylistmay1919grea/navylistmay1919grea.pdf|website=National Library of Scotland|publisher=Admiralty|date=1 May 1919|accessdate=1 April 2016|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sisters were listed for sale by 18 March 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Navy List|url=https://ia700804.us.archive.org/30/items/navylistapr1920grea/navylistapr1920grea.pdf|website=National Library of Scotland|date=18 March 1920|publisher=[[His Majesty's Stationery Office]]|location=London|accessdate=31 March 2016|page=1105a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Blonde'' was sold for scrap on 6 May to T. C. Pas, and was broken up in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Colledge, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
