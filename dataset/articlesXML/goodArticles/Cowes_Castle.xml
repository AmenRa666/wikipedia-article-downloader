'''Cowes Castle''', also known as '''West Cowes Castle''', is a [[Device Fort]] in [[Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. Originally built by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1539 to protect England against the threat of invasion from France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], it comprised a circular [[bastion]], flanking wings and a [[keep]], and in 1547 it housed 17 pieces of [[List of medieval and early modern gunpowder artillery|artillery]]. With its companion fortification at [[East Cowes Castle (16th century)|East Cowes]], the castle overlooked the entrance to the [[River Medina]], an important [[Anchorage (shipping)|anchorage]]. The invasion threat passed but the fortification continued in use until the middle of the 19th century, very briefly seeing action in 1642 during the [[English Civil War]].

Decommissioned in 1854, the castle was first leased, and later bought outright, by the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] to form their new clubhouse. The Squadron then employed the architect [[Anthony Salvin]] to rebuild large parts of it between 1856 and 1858. It became the headquarters for part of the [[D-Day]] invasion force during the [[Second World War]], but has otherwise remained in use by the Squadron and is a distinctive landmark in [[Yacht racing|yacht races]] along the Isle of Wight.

==History==

===16th century===
Cowes Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the final years of the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Traditionally [[the Crown]] had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1987|p=111}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modest defences, based around simple [[blockhouse]]s and towers, existed in the south-west and along the [[Sussex]] coast, augmented by a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1991|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1533, Henry broke with [[Pope Paul III]] to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], and remarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was the aunt of [[Charles V of Spain|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; An invasion of England appeared certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;[[Device Fort|device]]&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Walton|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Solent]], a stretch of water that gave access to the ports of [[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]], was considered vulnerable to attack. Two castles were built on the west and east sides of the [[River Medina]], the entrance to the principal harbour of the adjacent [[Isle of Wight]], and were intended to attack any enemy ships that might approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1267310|title=List Entry|publisher=Historic England|access-date=26 June 2015|mode = cs2}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castles took their names from the traditional term for this location, &quot;the Cowes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|2004|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed in 1539, the western fortification, which became known as West Cowes Castle, had a D-shaped [[bastion]] at the front, a round, two-storey [[keep]] at the rear and two low buildings on either side, all of which mounted [[List of medieval and early modern gunpowder artillery|artillery]] guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1267310|title=List Entry|publisher=Historic England|access-date=26 June 2015|mode = cs2}}; {{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |title=Cowes Castle|publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406233416/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |archive-date=9 April 2015 |mode=cs2}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landward side was protected by a ditch {{convert|4|m}} wide and a stone wall at least {{convert|2.4|m}} wide at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=41}};

Settlements grew up around both castles on the Medina, but East Cowes Castle was rapidly abandoned and ultimately destroyed by coastal erosion; as a result, today West Cowes Castle is often simply referred to as Cowes Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|1989|pp=40–41}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=461607|title=East Cowes Castle|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|accessdate = 26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspections in 1547 showed that there were 17 iron and [[brass]] artillery pieces at the fort, but that nine of these were inoperable; nonetheless it continued in use as a fortification after the original invasion scare had ended, staffed with a garrison of a captain, [[porter (doorkeeper)|porter]] and three [[gunner (artillery)|gunner]]s during Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woolnoth|1825|at=Cowes Castle}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/|title=Cowes Castle|publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron|access-date=26 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406233416/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/| archive-date=6 April 2015|mode = cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th–19th centuries===
[[File:West Cowes Castle 1725.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|1725 plan of the castle]]
Cowes Castle was used to house important visitors to the Isle of Wight and also as a prison; the captain of the castle had further responsibilities for managing the arrival of foreign vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |title=Cowes Castle |publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron|access-date=26 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406233416/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |archive-date=6 April 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[English Civil War]] broke out in 1642 between the supporters of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and Parliament, the castle was initially held for the King by its captain, Humphrey Turney.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; On 12 August, as tensions between the rival factions on the island increased, Turney personally fired one of the castle's guns at the nearby Parliamentary naval vessel ''[[English ship Lion (1557)|Lion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-castle/|title=The Castle|publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406184048/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-castle/ |archive-date=6 April 2015 |mode=cs2}}; {{harvnb|Godwin|1904|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unidentified Scottish naval captain then came ashore on 16 August and captured Turney, before landing more men and taking the castle for Parliament, who held it for the rest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Godwin|1904|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Interregnum]], the castle continued to be used as a prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicengland2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1267310 |title=List Entry |publisher=Historic England |access-date=26 June 2015 |mode=cs2}}; {{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |title=Cowes Castle |publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron |access-date=26 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406233416/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |archive-date=9 April 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles I could not be housed in the castle while en route to his imprisonment by Parliament at [[Carisbrooke Castle]] in 1647 because the facility was full, and he stayed at a local [[alehouse]] instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicengland2&quot;/&gt; The Royalist Sir [[William Davenant]] was imprisoned in Cowes during 1650, writing the poem ''[[Gondibert]]'' while incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1267310 |title=List Entry |publisher=Historic England |access-date=26 June 2015 |mode=cs2}}; {{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-castle/ |title=The Castle |publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron |access-date=26 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406184048/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-castle/| archive-date =6 April 2015|mode = cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with East Cowes Castle, coastal erosion proved a particular problem for the fortification.&lt;ref name=&quot;grose181&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Grose|1785|p=181}}; {{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/|title=Cowes Castle|publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406233416/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |archive-date=6 April 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inspection in 1692 reported that the walls were cracked and at risk of collapse, and the [[antiquarian]] [[Francis Grose]] observed in 1785 that the castle was &quot;strongly fenced with piles and planks&quot; to prevent erosion from the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;grose181&quot;/&gt;

During the course of the 18th century, Cowes became a fashionable location for visitors, with several [[bathhouse]]s, one of them located beside the castle, and by the early 19th century the town had become a noted resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woolnoth|1825|at=Cowes Castle}}; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2004|p=3}}; {{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |title=Cowes Castle |publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406233416/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/| archive-date=6 April 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowes Castle was partially rebuilt in 1716 to modernise its accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=460628&amp;sort=2&amp;type=&amp;rational=a&amp;class1= |title=West Cowes Castle|publisher=Historic England |access-date=26 June 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the front of the keep was demolished and rebuilt with new windows, a turret for a [[spiral staircase]] was erected, new three- and two-storey residential wings were added, and a garden was created over the landward defences.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicengland2&quot;/&gt; In 1795, the writer Richard Warner noted that the garrison consisted of the captain, a porter, two soldiers, a master gunner and five regular gunners, their wages coming to £103 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warner|1795|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money19thC|Comparing 18th-century costs and prices with those of the modern period depends on the price comparison used. £103 in 1795 could be worth between £9,700 and £690,000 in 2014 terms, depending on the measure used.&lt;ref name=MeasuringWorth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ |title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1270 to Present |author1=Lawrence H.

[[File:West Cowes Castle, 1796.png|thumb|left|An engraving of the castle in 1796]]
[[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Lord Anglesey]] became the captain of Cowes Castle in 1826, by now a [[sinecure]] rather than a regular military appointment, and spent part of each year at the castle, making further, lavish improvements to the interiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marquess of Anglesey|1996|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglesey was also a member of the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]], first established in 1815, which then operated from the Gloster Hotel in Cowes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|2004|p=3}}; {{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |title=Cowes Castle |publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406233416/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |archive-date=6 April 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time yachting had become a prestigious local event; the painter [[J.

The architect [[Anthony Salvin]], an expert on adapting medieval buildings, was employed by the Squadron to remodel the building between 1856 and 1858. He enlarged the house, altered its profile and built a new tower, platform and a [[gatehouse]], along with a service wing, a [[ballroom]] and more accommodation for the members, at a cost of around £6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1267310|title=List Entry|publisher=Historic England|access-date=26 June 2015|mode = cs2}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/|title=Cowes Castle|publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron|access-date=26 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406233416/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/| archive-date =9 April 2015|mode = cs2}}; {{harvnb|Clark|1904|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Albert]] and [[Edward VII|Edward]], the Prince of Wales, visited the castle before it was formally reopened in 1858; the work received mixed reviews, one local newspaper likening the result to &quot;a discipline establishment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Cowes became a major centre for yachting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the destruction of [[William IV of England|William IV]]'s miniature [[frigate]] the ''[[Royal Adelaide (1833)|Royal Adelaide]]'' in 1877, its 21 brass cannons were donated to the castle by the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/66170.html|title=Miniature Frigate Royal Adelaine|publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich|access-date=26 June 2015| archive-url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/66170.html| archive-date =30 June 2015|mode = cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowes Castle was bought outright from the Crown by the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/kinggeorge/p/003ktop00000015u026a0000.html |title=Plan of Cowes Castle in the Isle of Wight, 1725 |publisher=British Library |access-date=26 June 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further development work was carried out on the property in the 1920s, and a ballroom in an adjacent hotel was purchased for use as an annexe for female members.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

The Isle of Wight became an important staging location for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] efforts to invade France during the Second World War. By October 1942, the castle was occupied by the British [[Admiralty]] and became the senior officer's headquarters of the HQ Naval Commander Force &quot;J&quot; Landing Craft base, known as [[MS Vectis (shore establishment)|HMS Vectis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finley|1994|p=1}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/~/media/royal%20navy%20responsive/documents/events/d%20day%2070/13_472%20nhb%20operation%20neptune%20d_day%20book.pdf |title=Operation Neptune |publisher=NHB |access-date=26 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630185110/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/~/media/royal%20navy%20responsive/documents/events/d%20day%2070/13_472%20nhb%20operation%20neptune%20d_day%20book.pdf |archive-date=30 June 2015 |pages=7–8 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force's vessels docked in the nearby Solent, and took part in the [[Operation Overlord|D-Day landings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finley|1994|p=1}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/~/media/royal%20navy%20responsive/documents/events/d%20day%2070/13_472%20nhb%20operation%20neptune%20d_day%20book.pdf |title=Operation Neptune |publisher=NHB |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630185110/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/~/media/royal%20navy%20responsive/documents/events/d%20day%2070/13_472%20nhb%20operation%20neptune%20d_day%20book.pdf |archive-date=30 June 2015 |pages=7–10 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was damaged during the [[The Blitz|German bombing raids]] on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-rys-yachting/|title=The RYS &amp; Yachting |publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630184034/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-rys-yachting/ |archive-date=30 June 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the architect A. G. Biggs carried out substantial additions to the castle between 1962 and 1968, including remodelling the western range to provide for more female accommodation, using stone from the second [[East Cowes Castle]], an 18th and 19th-century stately home, which had been demolished the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/ |title=Cowes Castle|publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron|access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406233416/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/cowes-castle/| archive-date=6 April 2015 |mode=cs2}}; {{cite web |url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1267310 |title=List Entry |publisher=Historic England |access-date=26 June 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prefabricated conservatory extension followed in 1988, and a new pavilion designed by Sir [[Thomas Croft (architect)|Thomas Croft]] was added in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-castle/ |title=The Castle |publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406184048/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-castle/ |archive-date=6 April 2015 |mode=cs2}}; {{cite web |url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1267310 |title=List Entry |publisher=Historic England |access-date=26 June 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archaeological excavation]]s in the winter of 2010–11 rediscovered the remains of the old castle wall and ditch, and more than 400 artefacts were removed for storage at the Isle of Wight County Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maritimearchaeology.co.uk/west-cowes-castle-discoveries/ |title=West Cowes Castle Discoveries|publisher=Maritime Archaeology |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109193345/http://www.maritimearchaeology.co.uk/west-cowes-castle-discoveries/ |archive-date=9 January 2014 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowes Castle is a distinctive landmark in yachting and powerboat events, particularly at the start and finish of local races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1267310 |title=List Entry |publisher=Historic England |access-date=26 June 2015 |mode=cs2}}; {{cite web |url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-rys-yachting/ |title=The RYS &amp; Yachting |publisher=Royal Yacht Squadron |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630184034/https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-rys-yachting/ |archive-date =30 June 2015 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is protected under UK law as a 2* [[Listed Building]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historicengland1&quot;/&gt;
