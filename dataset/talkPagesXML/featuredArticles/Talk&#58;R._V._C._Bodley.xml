I don't think much point in looking at the Time Magazine letter book (your link).  I actually went on the the Time Mag site and you can read the letter itself.  It's an amusing letter describing exactly how British schoolboys were beaten (not with a literal cane).  Interesting and kind of funny really, the guy had a sort of Tom Wolfe or Steinbeck style of describing things, but not really anything to make it into the encyclopedia.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/72.82.33.69|72.82.33.69]] ([[User talk:72.82.33.69|talk]]) 08:25, 16 July 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:There's load's more on the skeleton of his career in the London Gazette, see these searches http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/exact=R.+V.+C.+Bodley;sort=oldest/start=1 and http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/exact=R.+V.+C.+Bodley;sort=oldest/start=1 [[User:David Underdown|David Underdown]] ([[User talk:David Underdown|talk]]) 12:01, 21 August 2013 (UTC)

This book has some decent information on his time in the pacific, if anyone wants to expand that paragraph. [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=DHxdSkoo4AMC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=R.V.C.+Bodley&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nJw7TPWyIovCcdPdzfoO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=R.V.C.%20Bodley&amp;f=false] [[User:Freikorp|Freikorp]] ([[User talk:Freikorp|talk]]) 03:21, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

On page 256 of [[The Two Hotel Francforts]], [[David Leavitt]] cites Bodley's book ''Flight into Portugal'' (amongst scores of others) as one of the books he read to familiarise himself with what it would have been like in Lisbon in 1940 (when the book is set).

== RVC is most common name ==
Use RVC or R.V.C.  He was not known as Ronald.  Seriously, do a search on his books or google.  RVC is how he is known.  Like TE Lawrence.  Not Theodore.

:I don't think we regard google hits as a reputable measure of anything much, since no one else does these days. Ronald will do fine until there is some evidence the other way. By the way, a possible reference is where it says [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article858328.ece here] that Bodley was helped by Anne Fremantle in his Sahara travels. [[User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]] ([[User talk:Charles Matthews|talk]]) 09:51, 16 July 2010 (UTC)
:There was also a 1943 ''New Yorker'' story [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1943/02/27/1943_02_27_009_TNY_CARDS_000192464]. [[User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]] ([[User talk:Charles Matthews|talk]]) 10:13, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

Well his books all use that name for him as well.

== Art collection ==
In my search for information on this man I found this, apparently there is a portrait of [[Thomas Gage]] in the &quot;Colonol R.V.C. Bodley collection in Boston&quot;. [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=LuF7o_s051AC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Major+R.V.C.+Bodley&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4Z07TIrJN8uHceH_8PwO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Major%20R.V.C.%20Bodley&amp;f=false] I can't find any further mention of this 'collection' anywhere. [[User:Freikorp|Freikorp]] ([[User talk:Freikorp|talk]]) 03:16, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

:From the context, it &quot;the collection of Bodley&quot; is just Bodley's personal possession.[[User:TCO|TCO]] ([[User talk:TCO|talk]]) 16:25, 30 June 2013 (UTC)

== DYK ==
Could this be a DYK?  Honest, I feel like Freikorp and CM and others did some nice work here.  (Of course, I really don't know what a DYK is either.)  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.127.134.132|71.127.134.132]] ([[User talk:71.127.134.132|talk]]) 21:32, 2 September 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Over 4 years later, but I finally got his article at DYK! :) [[User:Freikorp|Freikorp]] ([[User talk:Freikorp|talk]]) 07:55, 11 February 2015 (UTC)

== There is an old Army image of him that is PD, uploading...also some good commentary on the Flickr site ==
Some good commentary on his units on the Flickr site (kind of OR, but seems to be drawn from unit histories).  http://www.flickr.com/photos/32300107@N06/8935054938/in/photolist-eByuxm-damAJt-damAzn-8SxQqo-eDNq55-bQMePK-7Skjzs-8SuJrM-8SuLFk-8SxSCW

Also, London Gazette is referenced as having a good 1919 article on the man.  I guess, you could dig up more looking in old newspaper archives (some maybe not on the web or Googleable).  Also, he has been dead only 40 years or so, so one would imagine there's surviving family and the like who knew the man.  That said, not the most important thing in the world to research this fellow.

== [[:File:R. V. C. Bodley restoration.jpg]] to appear as POTD ==
Hello! This is a note to let the editors of this article know that [[:File:R. V. C. Bodley restoration.jpg]] will be appearing as [[Wikipedia:picture of the day|picture of the day]] on February 19, 2015. You can view and edit the POTD blurb at [[Template:POTD/2015-02-19]]. If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the [[Main Page]]. Thanks!&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 19:20, 31 January 2015 (UTC)
{{POTD/2015-02-19}}
:Hi {{u|Crisco 1492}}. Your POTD notice motivated me to considerable improve this article, which had been on my to-do list for some time. I got the article to GA status, and it is currently featured at DYK. I'll probably make some adjustments to the POTD blurb with the new information I added to the article in the next day or so, unless you wanted to do that yourself. Cheers.

:*Hi [[User:Freikorp|Freikorp]], I noticed! If you want to add a bit, feel free, but please keep the blurb length the same, as space on the MP is limited.&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 08:06, 11 February 2015 (UTC)
:::On second thought i'm going to leave it as is. Sure there is the interesting information of him being a screenwriter for Charlie Chaplin and woking for the Office of War, but I can't add that without cutting something else important, and it's already very well written. Looking forward to seeing this on the main page [again] tomorrow! :) [[User:Freikorp|Freikorp]] ([[User talk:Freikorp|talk]]) 12:51, 18 February 2015 (UTC)</text>
