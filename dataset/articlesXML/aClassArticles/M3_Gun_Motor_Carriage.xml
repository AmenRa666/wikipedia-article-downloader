The '''M3 Gun Motor Carriage''' (GMC) was a [[United States Army]] [[tank destroyer]] equipped with one 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun and was produced by [[Autocar Company|Autocar]]. After the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], the U.S. Army decided to make a [[self-propelled artillery]] piece from the [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|M1897A4 gun]] on the M3 chassis, which was designated the T12. After some improvement, it came into production as the M3 Gun Motor Carriage. However, the supply of M2A3 gun shields was insufficient for production needs, so a new gun shield was used. This was designated the M3A1 GMC.

The T12/M3 first served in the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|Philippines Campaign]] in 1942 with the [[Provisional Field Artillery Brigade]] in the anti-tank and the fire-support role. It then served in [[Tunisian Campaign|North Africa]] in [[Tank destroyer battalion (United States)|tank destroyer battalions]]. It was used ineffectively in the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]] and several other engagements, but was used with success in the [[Battle of El Guettar]]. It also served in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], but was eventually superseded by the [[M10 tank destroyer]]. A total of 2,203 were produced, of which 1,361 were converted back into M3A1 half-tracks.

The M3 GMC also served in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]], starting with the [[Battle of Saipan]]. It proved effective against the Japanese [[Type 95 Ha-Go]] and [[Type 97 Chi-Ha]] tanks. It later served in the [[Battle of Okinawa]], the [[Battle of Peleliu]] and many other island battles.

==Specifications==
The M3 GMC was 20.46&amp;nbsp;feet (6.24&amp;nbsp;m) long, 6.45&amp;nbsp;feet (1.97&amp;nbsp;m) wide, 8.17&amp;nbsp;feet (2.49&amp;nbsp;m) high (including the [[gun shield]]), and weighed 20,000&amp;nbsp;pounds (9.1&amp;nbsp;t). Its suspension consisted of semi-elliptical longitudal [[leaf spring]]s for the wheels and [[vertical volute spring suspension|vertical volute spring]]s for the tracks, while its transmission consisted of constant mesh. Its ground clearance was 11.2&amp;nbsp;inches (280&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref name=H218&gt;Hunnicutt, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=N204&gt;Ness, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

It had a [[White Motor Company|White]] 160AX 147&amp;nbsp;horsepower (110&amp;nbsp;kW), 386&amp;nbsp;cubic inch (6,330&amp;nbsp;cc),&lt;ref&gt;Hogg &amp; Weeks, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; 6-cylinder engine with a compression ratio of 6.44:1. It had a 150&amp;nbsp;mile (240&amp;nbsp;km) range,&lt;ref&gt;Berndt (1993), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; 60&amp;nbsp;US gal (230&amp;nbsp;l) fuel tank, a speed of 47&amp;nbsp;mph (75&amp;nbsp;km/h), and a power to weight ratio of 14.7&amp;nbsp;hp per ton. It was armed with one 75&amp;nbsp;mm [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|M1897A5]] with 59 rounds, had 0.25–0.625&amp;nbsp;in (6.4–15.9&amp;nbsp;mm) of armor, and a crew of five consisting of a commander, gunner, two loaders, and a driver. The M3 (with the M2A3 mount) could traverse 19° left and 21° right, elevate 29° and depress −10°. The M3A1 (using the M5 mount) could traverse 21° in both directions, but could only depress −6.5°.&lt;ref name=H218/&gt;&lt;ref name=N204/&gt;

==Development==
After the fall of France, the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the effectiveness of the German campaign against the French and British forces. One aspect that was highlighted by this study was the use of [[self propelled artillery]]; however, by 1941, there was little available in the U.S. Army's arsenal that could be used in such a role. The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the mass-production for such a weapon, and the M3 half-track was coming into production. After some debate, the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 half-track chassis,&lt;ref&gt;Hunnicutt, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by placing it in a welded box riveted to the chassis behind the driver's compartment. It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z22&quot; /&gt;

A batch of 36 T12s were used for testing, while another 50 were built and transported to [[Battle of the Philippines (1942)|the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Z33&gt;Zaloga, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The 36 T12s were improved in multiple ways. The improvements included the inclusion of a mount that raised the gun shield, the replacement of the original gun shield with the M2A3 gun shield, and the addition of a [[M2 machine gun|{{convert|0.5|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} M2 Browning machine gun]], which was later removed. After the final improvements were finished, the prototype vehicles were sent to the [[Autocar Company]] for production.&lt;ref name=Z22&gt;Zaloga, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunnicutt, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===M3A1===
As the existing supply of M2A3 gun shields was insufficient to meet requirements for the production of the M3, the [[Ordnance Department]] developed the M5 gun shield, which replaced the M2A3. The new design was designated as the M3A1 Gun Motor Carriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z33&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunnicutt, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berndt (1994), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==

===American use===
The T12/M3 GMC first saw action with the U.S. Army in the Philippines in 1941–42, six months after it was designed. Three battalions of the [[Provisional Field Artillery Brigade]] operated T12s against the Japanese when they invaded the Philippines. During the early part of the campaign, the vehicle was used to provide direct covering fire and anti-tank support. The Japanese captured a few vehicles in 1942 and used them in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|defense of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Z33&quot; /&gt;

By 1942, M3 GMCs were being used by [[Tank destroyer battalion (United States)|tank destroyer battalions]] in the [[North African Campaign]], each of which consisted of 36 M3s and four [[M6 Gun Motor Carriage|37&amp;nbsp;mm M6 GMC]]s. The M3 GMCs, which were designed for ambushing tanks, proved to be inadequate for this task in the battles of [[Battle of Sidi Bou Zid|Sidi Bou Zid]] and [[Battle of Kasserine Pass|Kasserine Pass]], mainly due to poor tactics. Nevertheless, the M3 was later used in the [[Battle of El Guettar]] with success, claiming 30 German tanks, including possibly two [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tanks, at the cost of 21 M3s. Some M3s also saw service in [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] (Operation Husky), but by that time, the [[M10 tank destroyer]] had replaced it in the U.S. Army.&lt;ref&gt;Mesko, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 1,360 M3 GMCs were also converted back into M3A1 half-tracks.&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mesko, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The M3 also served with the [[U.S. Marines]] in the Pacific Theater of Operations and was first used in the [[Battle of Saipan|invasion of Saipan]]. It proved highly effective against the [[Type 95 Ha-Go]] and the [[Type 97 Chi-Ha]], in the fight against the Japanese 9th Tank Regiment on Saipan. It also served in the [[Battle of Peleliu]] and the [[Battle of Okinawa]], and many other conflicts in the Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z35&quot; &gt;Zaloga, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allied use===
[[File:The British Army in Italy 1945 NA22387.jpg|thumbnail|right|Two British M3 GMCs used for indirect fire in Italy, 18 February 1945.|alt=Two British M3 GMCs used for indirect fire in a barren field in Northern Italy. The M3 in the foreground was nicknamed &quot;Acorn Inn&quot; by its crew.]]
The M3 GMC saw limited service with other countries as it was not widely supplied through the [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease program]]. A small batch of 170 vehicles were supplied to Britain, which used them in [[Armoured car regiment|armored car regiments]]. They were first used in the [[Tunisian Campaign]] with the [[Royal Dragoons]]. They were also used in Sicily, [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], and later in [[Operation Overlord|France]], but were gradually retired. The [[Free French Army]] also used M3s for training before receiving M10 tank destroyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z35&quot; /&gt;

==Production==
A total of 2,202 M3 GMCs were produced from 1941 to 1943. Only 86 vehicles were produced in 1941, but this was increased in 1942 during which 1,350 examples came off the production lines. A further 766 were completed in 1943. Production was stopped due to the release of better tank destroyers, like the M10 GMC.&lt;ref&gt;Ness, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;
