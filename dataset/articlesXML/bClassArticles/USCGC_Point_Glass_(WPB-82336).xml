'''USCGC ''Point Glass'' (WPB-82336)''' was an {{convert|82|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Point class cutter]] constructed at the [[United States Coast Guard Yard|Coast Guard Yard]] at [[Curtis Bay, Maryland]] in 1962 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1962 was not to name [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] under {{convert|100|ft|m|}} in length, it was designated as ''WPB-82336'' when commissioned and acquired the name ''Point Glass'' in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than {{convert|65|ft|m|}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG01&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina72&gt;Scheina, p 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and design details==
''Point Glass'' was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.&lt;ref name=Scheina71&gt;Scheina, p 71&lt;/ref&gt; She was powered by two {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT800 [[Cummins]] diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed {{convert|42|inch|m|abbr=on}} propellers. Water tank capacity was {{convert|1550|gal|liters|}} and fuel tank capacity was {{convert|1840|gal|liters|}} at 95% full.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG01&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina71&gt;Scheina, p 71&lt;/ref&gt; After 1990 she was refit with {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[Caterpillar, Inc.|Caterpillar]] diesel main drive engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG01&quot; /&gt; Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; 

The design specifications for ''Point Glass'' included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer [[Watch system|watch]] in the engine room.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Propeller|screw]]s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt; Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a [[ship floodability|watertight door]] on the [[starboard side]] aft of the [[deckhouse]]. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt; The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, [[scuttlebutt]], a small desk and [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], [[mess]] and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Point Glass'' was stationed at [[Tacoma, Washington]], from 1962 to 1970 and was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. While moored at Tacoma she was rammed by the Canadian tug ''Marpole'' on 26 May 1965 sustaining damage. After 1971 she was homeported at [[Gig Harbor, Washington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG01&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= Scheina74&gt;Scheina, p 74&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 she was transferred to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]. During the morning hours of 17 April 1992 ''Point Glass'' assisted the disabled MV ''G.H. Vanderburgh'' which was floundering in breaking surf and in danger of grounding on a [[coral reef]] six miles southwest of [[Fowey Rocks Light]] near [[Miami, Florida]]. ''Point Glass'' successfully navigated 34 miles through 8&amp;ndash;10 foot seas to the distressed vessel and determined that she had crossed over the outer reef line and was about to damage the environmentally sensitive coral reef at [[Biscayne National Park]]. After passing a line to ''G.H. Vanderburgh'', she towed her to safety, thereby saving the coral reef from damage and preventing harm to the seven man crew of the vessel. For these actions, the ''Point Glass'' and her crew were awarded the [[Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation]] with [[Operational Distinguishing Device]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG01&quot; /&gt; In 1998, ''Point Glass'' and her crew were awarded the [[Meritorious Team Commendation|Coast Guard Meritorious Team Commendation]] with the Operational Distinguishing Device for participating in the Shell Air/Sea show at Fort Lauderdale by being part of the task force enforcing a 3 square mile safety zone near the event and showing the audience a search and rescue demonstration as well as a high speed patrol boat pass.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG01&quot; /&gt;

''Point Glass'' was decommissioned on 3 April 2000 and ownership was transferred to [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) for use at the [[Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary]] where she served as NOAA Research Vessel ''Point Glass'' until sold to Point Glass LLC in 2006. The vessel is now used to support the Sea Scout program, part of the Boy Scouts of America, in order to teach navigation and seamanship skills.&lt;ref name=pgllc01&gt;''Point Glass'' history, Point Glass, LLC website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pgllc02&gt;NOAA Research Vessel ''Point Glass'' (R-8203), Point Glass, LLC website&lt;/ref&gt;
