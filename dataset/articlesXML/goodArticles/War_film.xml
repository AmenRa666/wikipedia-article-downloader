{{War}}

'''War film''' is a [[film genre]] concerned with [[war]]fare, typically about [[navy|naval]], [[air force|air]], or [[army|land]] battles in the twentieth century, with combat scenes central to the drama.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=117}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Manchel1990&quot;/&gt; The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them.&lt;!--{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=118}}--&gt; Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The stories told may be [[fiction]], [[historical drama film|historical drama]], or [[biographical]]. Critics have noted similarities between the [[Western (genre)|Western]] and the war film.

Nations such as China, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia have their own traditions of war film, centred on their own revolutionary wars but taking varied forms, from action and historical drama to wartime romance.

Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include [[anti-war film|anti-war]], comedy, [[animated film|animated]], [[propaganda]], and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific theatres such as the western desert (North Africa), the Pacific in the Second World War, or [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, [[submarine films|in submarines]], or at [[prisoner of war]] camps.

==Genre==
{{further information|List of war films}}

The war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the [[American Film Institute]], for example, speaks of &quot;films to grapple with the Great War&quot; without attempting to classify these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinema and the Great War|url=http://www.afi.com/silver/films/2014/p67/thegreatwar.aspx|publisher=AFI|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some directors and critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director [[Sam Fuller]] defined the [[film genre|genre]] by saying that &quot;a war film’s objective, no matter how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Macnab |first1=Geoffrey |title=Fury, film review: Brad Pitt stars as an unsympathetic hero in muted war movie |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/fury-film-review-brad-pitt-gives-intriguing-performance-as-unsympathetic-war-hero-9806584.html |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=5 March 2015 |date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Belton]] identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of [[Hollywood]] production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as marginalization and objectification of women, and d) depiction of the reintegration of veterans.{{sfn|Belton|1994| pp=165–171}}

[[File:John Wayne in The Longest Day trailer.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3&lt;!--size for low-aspect-ratio image--&gt;|[[John Wayne]] in ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'', 1962]]
The film critic Stephen &lt;!--Bernard Morris--&gt;Neale suggests that the genre is for the most part well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those about war being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central to the drama. However, Neale notes, films set in the [[American Civil War]] or the American [[Indian Wars]] of the 19th century were called war films in the time before the First World War.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=117}} The critic Julian Smith argues, on the contrary, that the war film lacks the formal boundaries of a genre like the [[Western (genre)|Western]], but that in practice, &quot;successful and influential&quot; war films are about modern wars, in particular World War II, with the combination of mobile forces and mass killing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manchel1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Manchel |first=Frank |title=Film Study: An Analytical Bibliography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BebEAji_wH4C&amp;pg=PA200 |date=January 1990 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |isbn=978-0-8386-3186-7 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film scholar Kathryn Kane&lt;ref&gt;Kane, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; points out some similarities between the war film genre and the Western. Both genres use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War films usually frame [[World War II]] as a conflict between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; as represented by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and [[Nazi Germany]] whereas the Western portrays the conflict between civilized settlers and the savage indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, Kathryn. &quot;The World War II Combat Film&quot;. In: Wes D. Gehring (ed.) ''Handbook of American Film Genres''. New York: Greenwood Press, 1988, pp. 90-91, ISBN 978-0-313-24715-6.&lt;/ref&gt; James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' and &quot;war-movie escapades&quot; like ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]''.{{sfn|Clarke|2006|pp=9–10}}

Film historian [[Jeanine Basinger]] states that she began with a preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that{{sfn|Basinger|1986|p=23}}

{{quote|What I knew in advance was what presumably every member of our culture would know about World War II combat films—that they contained a [[hero]], a group of mixed types [of people], and a [[military objective]] of some sort. They take place in the actual combat zones of World War II, against the established enemies, on the ground, the sea, or in the air. They contain many repeated events, such as mail call, all presented visually with appropriate [[uniform]]s, equipment, and iconography of battle.{{sfn|Basinger|1986|p=23}}}}

Further, Basinger considers ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'' to provide a definition-by-example of &quot;the World War II combat film&quot;, in which a diverse and apparently unsuited group of &quot;hastily assembled volunteers&quot; hold off a much larger group of the enemy through their &quot;bravery and tenacity&quot;.{{sfn|Eberwein|2005|pp=30–31}} She argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film. Since she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre, are outweighed by the many other films that lie on the margins of being war films.{{sfn|Basinger|1986|pp=14–75}} However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film, to include films that deal &quot;with the roles of civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and consequences or aftermath.)&quot;{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=117–121}} Neale points out that genres overlap, with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and suggests that war films are characterised by combat which &quot;determines the fate of the principal characters&quot;. This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of war films.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=118}} Not all critics agree, either, that war films must be about 20th century wars. James Clarke includes [[Edward Zwick]]'s Oscar-winning ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' (1990) among the war films he discusses in detail; it is set in the [[American Civil War]], and he lists six other films about that war which he considers &quot;notable&quot;.{{sfn|Clarke|2006|pp=227–237}}{{efn|Clarke's list of &quot;notable Civil War films&quot; is ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]'' (1965), ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' (2003), ''[[Andersonville (film)|Andersonville]]'' (1966), ''[[The Beguiled]]'' (1971), ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]'' (1985), and ''[[Ride with the Devil (film)|Ride with the Devil]]'' (1999).{{sfn|Clarke|2006|p=236}}}}

==History==

===The American Civil War===
The costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war has been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films, documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject was [[D.W. Griffith]]'s 1910 silent picture, ''[[The Fugitive (1910 film)|The Fugitive]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/F/Fugitive1910.html | publisher=Silent Era | title=The Fugitive | accessdate=23 June 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403134807/http://silentera.com/PSFL/data/F/Fugitive1910.html | archivedate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war include the 1989 film, ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'', about the first formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of black men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/glory-1989 | publisher=RogerEbert.com | title=Glory | accessdate=23 June 2015 | last=Ebert | first=Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some films such as ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'' focused on a single battle during the war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-10-09/features/1993282122_1_ted-turner-gettysburg-jeff-daniels | publisher=The Baltimore Sun | title=GETTYSBURG: Ted Turner, a cast of thousands and the ghosts of the past | accessdate=23 June 2015 | date=9 October 1993 | last=Jubera | first=Drew}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even on a single incident, like the French short film, ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|La Rivière du Hibou]]'' (''An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge'').&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/35918/An-Occurrence-at-Owl-Creek-Bridge/details |title=New York Times: An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge |accessdate=22 May 2008 | work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others like the 1993 miniseries ''[[North and South (miniseries)|North and South]]'' spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as ''[[The Red Badge of Courage (film)|The Red Badge of Courage]]'' (1951),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v40655 | publisher=AllMovie | title=The Red Badge of Courage: Synopsis |last=Erickson | first=Hal | accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]'' (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/31258%7C0/Shenandoah.html | publisher=Turner Classic Movies | title=Shenandoah: article | accessdate=23 June 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623170545/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/31258%7C0/Shenandoah.html | archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Burns]]'s ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' is the most watched documentary in the history of [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/civilwar/filmmakers/ | publisher=PBS | title=The Filmmakers: Ken Burns | accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Spanish–American War===

The first war films come from the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898. Short &quot;actualities&quot; – documentary film-clips – included ''Burial of the Maine Victims'', ''Blanket-Tossing of a New Recruit'', and ''Soldiers Washing Dishes''. These non-combat films were accompanied by &quot;reenactments&quot; of fighting, such as of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s &quot;Rough Riders&quot; in action against the Spanish, staged in the United States.{{sfn|Eberwein|2010|p=5}}

===The First World War===
{{further information|Fiction based on World War I}}

During the First World War, many films were made about life in the war. Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral countries like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the Eastern Front by official war photographer to the Central Powers, [[Albert K. Dawson]]: ''[[The Battle and Fall of Przemysl]]'' (1915), depicting the [[Siege of Przemyśl]], disastrous for the Austrians, with incidents reenacted using soldiers as extras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World War I: Siege Of Przemysl |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJchHW2SXs0 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Movies: The Battle and Fall of Przemysl (1915) |url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/236068/The-Battle-and-Fall-of-Przemysl/overview |accessdate=6 March 2015 |work=New York Times |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1915 Australian film ''[[Within Our Gates (1915 film)|Within Our Gates]]'' (also known as ''Deeds that Won Gallipoli'') by [[Frank Harvey (Australian screenwriter)|Frank Harvey]] was described by the ''Motion Picture News'' as &quot;a really good war story, which is exceptional&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturenew132unse#page/1446/mode/2up/search/australia &quot;Film News from Foreign Parts&quot;, ''Motion Picture News'' 11 March 1916] accessed 23 November 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1916 British film ''[[The Battle of the Somme (film)|The Battle of the Somme]]'', by two official cinematographers, [[Geoffrey Malins]] and John McDowell, combined documentary and propaganda, seeking to give the public an impression of what [[trench warfare]] was like. Much of the film was shot on location at the Western Front in France; it had a powerful emotional impact. It was watched by some 20 million people in Britain in its six weeks of exhibition, making it what the critic [[Francine Stock]] called &quot;one of the most successful films of all time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Battle of the Somme (DVD viewing guide) |last=Smither |first=R.B.N. |year=2008 |publisher=Imperial War Museum |edition=2nd rev. |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/upload/package/100/Somme%20DVD/documents/viewing_guide.pdf |isbn=0-90162-794-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stock |first1=Francine |title=Why was the Battle of the Somme film bigger than Star Wars?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zc3dhyc |publisher=BBC |accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William A. Wellman]]'s ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' (1927), about the First World War, was the first film (in any genre), and the only silent film, to win an Oscar for best picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1st Academy Awards : 1929|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1929|publisher=Oscars.org|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later films of varied genres that deal with the First World War include [[David Lean]]'s &quot;colossal epic&quot;, both war film and biopic&lt;ref name=BFI-Lawrence/&gt; ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), shot in the then unfamiliar and exciting [[70mm]] [[Technicolor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fahy |first1=Patrick |title=Lawrence of Arabia: 50 years ago |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/lawrence-arabia-50-years-ago |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=9 March 2015 |date=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described by [[Steven Spielberg]] as &quot;maybe the greatest screenplay ever written for the motion-picture medium&quot;;&lt;ref name=BFI-Lawrence&gt;{{cite web |title=Lawrence of Arabia (1962) |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6aea50ea |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Attenborough]]'s satirical anti-war musical comedy based on [[Joan Littlewood]]'s play of the same name, ''[[Oh!

===The Spanish Civil War===

{{further information|List of Spanish Civil War films}}

The [[Spanish Civil War]] has attracted directors from different countries. [[Sam Wood]]'s ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), based on [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s [[For Whom the Bell Tolls|book of the same name]], portrays the fated romance between an American played by [[Gary Cooper]] and a partisan played by [[Ingrid Bergman]] against the backdrop of the civil war. The epic 168 minute film with its landscapes shot in Technicolor and a &quot;beautiful&quot; orchestral score was a success both with audiences and with critics.&lt;ref name=Harvard/&gt; [[Alain Resnais]]'s ''[[Guernica (1950 film)|Guernica]]'' (1950) uses [[Picasso]]'s  ''[[Guernica (painting)|painting]]'' to protest against war.&lt;ref name=Harvard/&gt; [[Carlos Saura]]'s ''[[La Caza]]'' (The Hunt, 1966) uses the metaphor of hunting to criticise the aggressiveness of Spanish [[fascism]].&lt;ref name=Pulver-Spanish&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pulver|first1=Andrew|title=A short history of Spanish cinema|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/mar/29/short-history-spanish-cinema|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 March 2015|date=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[16th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1966/03_preistr_ger_1966/03_Preistraeger_1966.html |title=Berlinale 1966: Prize Winners |accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'' (''Tierra y Libertad'', 1995), loosely based on [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', follows a British communist through the war to reveal the painful contradictions within the anti-fascist Republican side.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web |title=Franco, Fascists, and Freedom Fighters: The Spanish Civil War on Film |url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2007spring/spanish.html |publisher=Harvard Film Archive|accessdate=11 March 2015 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Korean War===

[[Samuel Fuller]]’s ''[[The Steel Helmet]]'' (1951) was made during the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953). The critic Guy Westwell notes that it questioned the conduct of the war, as did later films like ''[[The Bridges at Toko-Ri]]'' (1954) and ''[[Pork Chop Hill]]'' (1959).{{sfn|Westwell|2006|pp=51–53}} Fuller agreed that all his films were anti-war. No Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the box office; the historian Lary May suggested that they reminded American viewers of &quot;the only war we have lost&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestSŏ2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Philip |last2=Sŏ |first2=Chi-mun |title=Remembering the &quot;Forgotten War&quot;: The Korean War Through Literature and Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ajmbslz-GacC&amp;pg=PA127 |date=1 January 2001 |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |isbn=978-0-7656-0696-9 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, after the fighting, the successful [[Republic of Korea|South Korean]] action film ''[[Piagol]]''  about leftist guerrilla atrocities encouraged other film-makers. The 1960s military government punished pro-communist film-makers and gave Grand Bell Awards to films with the strongest anti-communist message. Censorship loosened in the 1980s. ''[[The Taebaek Mountains]]'' (1994) dealt with leftists from the south who fought for the communists, while ''[[Silver Stallion]]'' (1991) and ''[[Spring in My Hometown]]'' (1998) showed the destructive impact of American military presence on village life. The violent action films ''[[Shiri (film)|Shiri]]'' (1999) and ''[[Joint Security Area (film)|Joint Security Area]]'' (2000) presented North Korea in a favourable light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paquet, Darcy | url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/warfilms.html |title=South Korean Films About the Korean War (1950-53): A Tool for Reference | publisher=Koreanfilm.org |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films in [[Democratic Republic of Korea|North Korea]] were made by government film studios and had clear political messages. The first was ''[[My Home Village]]'' (1949), on the liberation of Korea from the Japanese, presented as the work of [[Kim Il Sung]] without help from the Americans. Similarly, the country's films about the Korean War show victory without help from the Chinese. The film scholar Johannes Schönherr concludes that the purpose of these films is &quot;to portray North Korea as a country under siege&quot;, and that since the U.S. and its &quot;puppet&quot; South Korea invaded the North once, they would do so again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Schönherr  |first = Johannes |year = 2012 |title = North Korean Cinema: A History |publisher = McFarland| location = Jefferson, N.C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6n0itIPmakC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-786-46526-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6n0itIPmakC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=My%20Home%20Village&amp;f=false pp. 4, 29–31]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Algerian War===

[[Gillo Pontecorvo]]'s dramatic ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' (({{lang-it|La battaglia di Algeri}}; {{lang-ar|معركة الجزائر}}; {{lang-fr|La Bataille d'Alger}}), 1966) portrayed events in the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1956). It was shot on location as an Italo-Algerian co-production. It had the black and white newsreel style of [[Italian neorealism]], and even-handedly depicts violence on both sides. It won various awards including [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Wilde |first1=Gervase |title=The Battle of Algiers, DVD review |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/6081647/The-Battle-of-Algiers-DVD-review.html |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was attacked by French critics and was for five years banned in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matthews |first1=Peter |title=The Battle of Algiers: Bombs and Boomerangs |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/342-the-battle-of-algiers-bombs-and-boomerangs |publisher=Criterion |accessdate=11 March 2015 |date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Vietnam War===

[[File:NguyenVanBe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Viet Cong]] poster for a 1967 film about the supposed martyrdom of Nguyen Van Be]]

Few films before the late 1970s about the [[Vietnam War]] actually depicted combat.{{sfn|Neale|2000|pp=121–124}} The exceptions included ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' (1968).{{sfn|Neale|2000|pp=121–124}} Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because of [[opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War]], making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army did not wish to assist in making anti-war films.{{sfn|Neale|2000|pp=121–124}}{{sfn|Basinger|1986|pp=212–213}}

From the late 1970s, independently financed and produced films showed Hollywood that Vietnam could be treated in film. Successful but very different portrayals of the war in which America had been defeated included [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978), and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979).{{sfn|Neale|2000|pp=121–124}} &lt;!--both films won Oscars, would need refs for that--&gt; With the shift in American politics to the right in the 1980s, military success could again be shown in films such as [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986), [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987) and [[John Irvin]]'s ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987).{{sfn|Neale|2000|pp=121–124}}

The Vietnamese director Nguyen Hong Sen's ''[[The Abandoned Field: Free Fire Zone]]'' (''Canh dong hoang'', 1979) gives an &quot;unnerving and compelling .. subjective-camera-eye-view&quot; of life under helicopter fire in the [[Mekong Delta]] during the Vietnam War. The film cuts to an (American) &quot;helicopter-eye view&quot;, contrasting painfully with the human tenderness seen earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Abandoned Field-Free Fire Zone (Canh dong hoang) |url=http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN7762 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley Art Museum &amp; Pacific Film Archive |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first popular [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war films made during the [[Second World War]] came from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and combined the functions [[documentary film|documentary]] and propaganda. Films such as ''[[The Lion Has Wings]]'' and ''[[Target for Tonight]]'' were made under the control of the Films Division of the Ministry of Information. The [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British film industry]] began to combine documentary techniques with fictional stories in films like [[Noël Coward]] and [[David Lean]]'s ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' (1942) – &quot;the most successful British film of the war years&quot;,{{sfn|Murphy|2005|p=64}} ''[[Millions Like Us]]'' (1943), and ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944).&lt;ref name=&quot;Swann1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Swann |first=Paul |title=The British Documentary Film Movement, 1926-1946 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAV80f4DohgC |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-33479-2 |pages=viii, 150–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, documentaries were produced in various ways: General Marshall commissioned the ''[[Why We Fight]]'' propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War Department's Information-Education Division started out making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Battle of San Pietro]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Martin J. |title=Historical Dictionary of American Propaganda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-JjwDPcOLQC&amp;pg=PA86 |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29605-5 |pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America's allies, such as ''[[Mrs. Miniver (film)|Mrs. Miniver]]'' (1942), which portrayed a British family on the home front;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mrs. Miniver (1942) |work=The New York Times |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/33719/Mrs-Miniver/overview |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Edge of Darkness (1943 film)|Edge of Darkness]]'' (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters,&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|id=2891|title=Edge of Darkness}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The North Star (1943 film)|The North Star]]'' (1943) showed the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|id=85227|title=The North Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the war popular books provided higher quality and more serious stories for films such as ''[[Guadalcanal Diary (film)]]'' (1943),&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|id=77030|title=Guadalcanal Diary}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944),{{sfn|Orriss|1984|pp=93–100}} and [[John Ford]]'s ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|2070|They Were Expendable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russians, too, appreciated the propaganda value of film, to publicise both victories and German atrocities. Ilya Kopalin's documentary ''[[Moscow Strikes Back]]'' ({{lang-ru|Разгром немецких войск под Москвой}}, literally &quot;The rout of the German troops near Moscow&quot;), was made during the [[Battle of Moscow]] between October 1941 and January 1942. It depicted civilians helping to defend the city, the parade in [[Red Square]] and [[Stalin]]'s speech rousing the Russian people to battle, actual fighting, Germans surrendering and dead, and atrocities including murdered children and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943 for best documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Moscow Strikes Back |url=https://archive.org/details/MoscowStrikesBack |publisher=Artkino Pictures |accessdate=17 March 2015 |date=1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1942&gt;{{cite web|last1=&quot;T.S.&quot; |title=Movie Review: Moscow Strikes Back (1942) 'Moscow Strikes Back,' Front-Line Camera Men's Story of Russian Attack, Is Seen at the Globe |url=http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E0D7113CE33BBC4F52DFBE668389659EDE |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=18 March 2015 |date=17 August 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed to [[Stalingrad]] early in 1943 to record &quot;the spectacle which greeted the Russian soldiers&quot; – the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the Voropovono camp by the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Sixth Army]], defeated in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beevor |first1=Antony |title=Stalingrad |year=1999 |origyear=1998 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-140-24985-0 |pages=350–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feature films made in the west during the war were subject to censorship and were not always&lt;!--qua, hardly ever--&gt; realistic. One of the first to attempt to represent violence, and which was praised at the time for &quot;gritty realism&quot;, was [[Tay Garnett]]'s ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'' (1943). The depiction actually remained stylised: Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the &quot;worst image for stark violence&quot; when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been killed or who had come home wounded.&lt;ref name=AHA-Basinger&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Basinger |first1=Jeanine |title=Translating War: The Combat Film Genre and Saving Private Ryan |journal=Perspectives on History|url=http://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/october-1998/translating-war-the-combat-film-genre-and-saving-private-ryan |date=1998 |publisher=American Historical Association |accessdate=7 March 2015 |issue=October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The studio made propaganda films such as ''[[Triumph des Willens]]'' (1935) and ''[[Kolberg (film)|Kolberg]]'' (1945).]]

The [[Axis powers]] similarly made films during the Second World War, for propaganda and other purposes. In Germany, the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|army high command]] brought out ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (&quot;Victory in the West&quot;, 1941).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herzstein |first1=Robert E | title=The War that Hitler Won |date=1979 | publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=0-399-11845-4 |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Nazi propaganda films had varied subjects, as with ''[[Kolberg (film)|Kolberg]]'' (1945), which depicts stubborn [[Prussia]]n resistance in the [[Siege of Kolberg (1807)]] to the invading French troops under [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kolberg |url=http://www.filmportal.de/en/movie/kolberg_ea43d4a739775006e03053d50b37753d |publisher=FilmPortal.de |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] chose the historical subject as suitable for the worsening situation facing Nazi Germany when it was filmed from October 1943 to August 1944. At over eight million marks, using thousands of soldiers as extras and 100 railway wagonloads of salt to simulate snow, it was the most costly German film made during the war. The actual siege ended with the surrender of the town; in the film, the French generals abandon the siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leiser |first1=Erwin |title=Nazi Cinema |date=1974 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-02-570230-0 |pages=122–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Japan, the war began with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|undeclared war and invasion of China in 1937]], which the Japanese authorities called &quot;The China Incident&quot;. The government dispatched a &quot;pen brigade&quot; to write and film the action in China with &quot;humanist values&quot;. [[Tomotaka Tasaka]]'s ''[[Mud and Soldiers]]'' (1939) for instance, shot on location in China, [[Kōzaburō Yoshimura]]'s ''[[Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi]]'', and [[Sato Takeshi]]'s ''[[Chocolate and Soldiers]]'' (1938) show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes fighting bravely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=High  |first=Peter B  |year=2003 |title=The Imperial Screen: Japanese Film Culture in the Fifteen Years' War, 1931-1945 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press| location=Madison |isbn=0-299-18130-8 |ref=harv}} esp.

Dower|John Dower]] found that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as &quot;losers do not get reruns&quot;, yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought ''Chocolate and Soldiers'' unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking officers, not [[samurai]], calmly devoted to his men and his country.{{sfn|Dower|1993|p=48}} These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred, though Great Britain could figure as the &quot;cultural enemy&quot;. For Japanese film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and &quot;what mattered was not whom one fought but how well&quot;. Asian enemies, especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as an &quot;innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people&quot;. Dower comments that the perversity of this image &quot;is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others.&quot;{{sfn|Dower|1993|p=49}}

According to Andrew Pulver of ''The Guardian'', the public fascination with war films became an &quot;obsession&quot;, with over 200 war films produced in each decade of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=Pulver/&gt; War film production in the United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid 1950s. {{Sfn|Mayer|2003|p=83}} Its popularity in the United Kingdom was brought on by the critical and commercial success of  [[Charles Frend]]'s ''[[The Cruel Sea (1953 film)|The Cruel Sea]]'' (1953).{{Sfn|Mayer|2003|p=83}} Like others of the period, ''The Cruel Sea'' was based on a bestselling novel, in this case the former naval commander [[Nicholas Monsarrat]]'s story of the [[battle of the Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=&quot;A.

By the end of the decade the &quot; sense of shared achievement&quot; which had been common in war films &quot;began to evaporate&quot;, according to Pulver.&lt;ref name=Pulver/&gt;

[[Hollywood]] films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular heroics or self-sacrifice, as in the popular ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'' (1949) starring [[John Wayne]]. U.S. Marines considered ''Sands of Iwo Jima'' visually authentic, but found Lewis Milestone's ''[[Battle Cry (film)|Battle Cry]]'' (1955), with its attention to the lives of the men, the more realistic film.{{sfn|Suid|2002|pp=116–135}} The formula for a successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence Suid, of a small group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable senior officer; cowards became heroic, or died.{{sfn|Suid|2002|pp=116–135}} Jeanine Basinger suggests that a traditional war film should have a hero, a group, and an objective, and that the group should contain &quot;an Italian, a Jew, a cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a sharpshooter from the mountains, a midwesterner (nicknamed by his state, &quot;Iowa&quot; or &quot;Dakota&quot;), and a character who must be initiated in some way&quot;.&lt;ref name=AHA-Basinger/&gt; Films based on real [[commando]] missions, like [[Gift Horse (film)|''The Gift Horse'']] (1952) based on the [[St. Nazaire Raid]], and ''[[Ill Met by Moonlight (film)|Ill Met by Moonlight]]'' (1956) based on the capture of the German commander of Crete, inspired fictional adventure films such as ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'' (1964) and ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968).

[[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998) uses hand-held camera, sound design, staging and increased audio-visual detail to defamiliarise viewers accustomed to conventional combat films, so as to create what film historian Stuart Bender calls &quot;reported realism&quot;, whether or not the portrayal is genuinely more realistic.{{sfn|Bender|2013|p=ix}} Jeanine Basinger notes that critics experienced it as &quot;groundbreaking and anti-generic&quot;, with, in James Wolcott's words, a &quot;desire to bury the cornball, recruiting poster legend of John Wayne: to get it right this time&quot;; and that combat films have always been &quot;grounded in the need to help an audience understand and accept war&quot;.&lt;ref name=AHA-Basinger/&gt; Its success revived interest in World War II films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Stein |first=Howard F. |title=Beneath the Crust of Culture: Psychoanalytic Anthropology and the Cultural Unconscious in American Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTxfvLvjeGEC&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2004 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn=90-420-0818-0 |page=6 |quote=&quot;Chris Vognar writes&lt;!--2002--&gt;: Saving Private Ryan wasn't just a great movie: it was also the cultural touchstone for the country's revived interest in World War II.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in  [[Joseph Vilsmaier]]'s ''[[Stalingrad (1993 film)|Stalingrad]]'' (1993), which the ''New York Times'' said &quot;goes about as far as a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning form of mass slaughter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holden |first1=Stephen |title=Stalingrad (1992) FILM REVIEW; In War's Horrors, Chaos May Rank With Carnage |url=http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE5DA163EF937A15756C0A963958260 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=8 March 2015 |date=24 May 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many war films have been produced with the cooperation of a nation's military forces. After the Second World War, the [[United States Navy]] provided ships and technical guidance for films such as ''[[Top Gun]]''. The [[U.S. Air Force]] assisted with ''[[The Big Lift]]'', ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'' and ''[[A Gathering of Eagles]]'', which were filmed on Air Force bases; Air Force personnel appeared in many roles.{{sfn|Suid|2015|pp=161–209}} Critics point out that the film ''Pearl Harbor'''s US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for technical assistance received by the US armed forces; the premiere was actually held on board a U.S. Navy carrier.{{sfn|Rayner|2007|pp=1–2}} In another case, the U.S. Navy objected to elements of ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'', especially mutiny on board an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their assistance.{{sfn|Suid|2002|p=609}} Film historian Jonathan Rayner observes that such films &quot;have also clearly been intended to serve vital propagandist, recruitment and public relations functions&quot;.{{sfn|Rayner|2007|pp=1–2}}

==National traditions==

===Chinese===

The first Chinese war films were newsreels like ''[[Battle of Wuhan (1911 film)|Battle of Wuhan]]'' (1911) and ''[[Battle of Shanghai (1913 film)|Battle of Shanghai]]'' (1913). Still in films such as [[Xu Xinfu]]'s ''[[Battle Exploits]]'' (1925), war featured mainly as background. Only with the Second Sino–Japanese War from 1937 onwards did war film become a serious genre in China, with nationalistic films such as [[Shi Dongshan]]'s ''[[Protect Our Land]]'' (1938) The Chinese Civil War, too, attracted films such as [[Cheng Yin]]'s ''[[From Victory to Victory]]'' (1952). A more humanistic film set in the same period is [[Xie Jin]]'s The Cradle (1979), while more recent large-scale commercial films include [[Lu Chuan]]'s ''[[City of Life and Death]]'' (2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;YeZhu2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ye |first1=Tan |last2=Zhu |first2=Yun |title=Historical Dictionary of Chinese Cinema |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=javqwyBe0WoC&amp;pg=PA168 |year=2012 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-8108-6779-6 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese directors have repeatedly attempted to cover the atrocities committed by the Japanese during the [[Nanking massacre]] (1937–1938), with films such as the political melodrama ''[[Massacre in Nanjing]]'', [[Mou Tun Fei]]'s [[docudrama]] ''[[Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre]]'', and the &quot;contrived Sino–Japanese romance&quot; ''[[Don't Cry, Nanking]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Li&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Li |first=Peter |title=Japanese War Crimes: The Search for Justice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2J0ZqRZw-QQC&amp;pg=PA222 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-1-4128-2683-9 |pages=204–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Yimou]]'s epic Chinese film ''[[Flowers of War]]'' (2011), based on [[Geling Yan]]'s novel, portrays the violent events through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web &lt;!--|last=Pollard |first=Lawrence--&gt;|title=The story behind Chinese war epic The Flowers of War |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16638897 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Indonesian cinema|Indonesian films]] deal with the occupation of the archipelago by the Japanese during the Second World War. [[Teguh Karya]]'s ''[[Doea Tanda Mata]]'' (''Mementos'', literally &quot;Two Eye Marks&quot;, 1985) covers the limited nationalist resistance to Dutch colonial rule in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doea Tanda Mata (1986) |url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/120596/Doea-Tanda-Mata/overview |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Heider|1991|pp=99–107}}  A third group of films such as ''[[Enam Djam di Jogja]]'' (''Six Hours in Yogyakarta'', 1951) and ''[[Serangan Fajar]]'' (''Attack at Dawn'', 1983) covers the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian war of independence]] (1945–1949).&lt;!--actually, these two both deal with the 1 March general assault--&gt; Two other films about the same period portray the Indonesian equivalent of the Chinese [[Long March]]: [[Usmar Ismail]]'s ''[[Darah dan Doa]]'' (''The Long March'', literally &quot;Blood and Prayer&quot;, 1950) and ''[[Mereka Kembali]]'' (''They Return'', 1975). Each of these films interprets the past from the perspective of its own time.{{sfn|Heider|1991|pp=99–107}}

The more recent ''Merdeka'' (Freedom) trilogy (2009–2011), starting with ''[[Merah Putih (2009 film)|Merah Putih]]'' (&quot;Red and White&quot;, the colours of the flag of the new Indonesia), revisits the campaign for independence through the lives of a diverse group of cadets who become guerillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parrot |first1=John |title=Review: Red and White (Merah Putih) |url=http://thefilmreview.com/reviews/review-red-white-merah-putih.html |publisher=The Film Review |accessdate=11 March 2015 |date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karya's ''[[November 1828]]'' (1979) looks at Indonesia's struggle for independence through [[historical drama]] about the [[Java War|Java or Diponegoro War]] (1825–1830), though the colonial enemy was the same, the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]]. Deanne Schultz considered it &quot;a valuable interpretation&quot; of [[Indonesian history]] that &quot;embodies the best of popular Indonesian cinema.&quot; It was the first Indonesian film to become well-known internationally.{{sfn|Schultz|2007|p=133}}

The wartime authorities in both Britain and America produced a wide variety of [[documentary]] films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information, support for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swann1989&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning2004&quot;/&gt; [[Newsreels]], ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Art of Wartime Newsreels – 1940 through 1946 |url=http://1940s.org/the-art-of-wartime-newreels-1940-through-1946 |publisher=1940s.org |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Wartime Newsreels (Die Deutsche Wochenschau) |url=http://ihffilm.com/gerwarnew.html |publisher=International Historic Films |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wartime Newsreel British News Now Online|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/2012/05/04/british-news|publisher=British Universities Film &amp; Video Council|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the [[Iran-Iraq War]], [[Morteza Avini]]'s ''[[Ravayat-e Fath]]'' (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rastegar |first1=Kamran |title=Surviving Images: Cinema, War, and Cultural Memory in the Middle East |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-199-39017-5 |page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, [[propaganda film|film propaganda]] was widely used. [[Kenneth Clark]] advised the British government that &quot;If we renounced interest in entertainment as such, we might be deprived of a valuable weapon for getting across our propaganda&quot;; he suggested using documentaries about the war and the war effort; celebrations of Britishness; and films about British life and character. [[Michael Powell]] and Clark agreed on a story about survivors of a [[U-boat]] crew, imbued with brutal Nazi ideology, travelling across Canada and meeting various kind, tolerant and intelligent Canadians, to encourage America into the war.

{{main article|Submarine films}}

[[Submarine films]] have their own particular meanings and conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of [[submarine warfare]]. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the [[soundtrack]], which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s 1981 ''[[Das Boot]]'', the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with [[depth charge]]s, the ping of [[sonar]], and threatening sounds such as of the [[propellor]]s of enemy [[destroyer]]s and [[torpedo]]es.&lt;ref name=Koldau&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koldau |first1=Linda Maria |title=Sound effects as a genre-defining factor in submarine films|journal=MedieKultur |date=2010 |volume=48 |pages=18–30 |url=http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/mediekultur/article/viewFile/2117/2393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classic films in the genre include ''[[The Enemy Below]]'' (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Duel to the Death |url=http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501EFD91131E63ABC4E51DFB467838C649EDE |publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=8 March 2015 |date=26 December 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders.

British cinema in the Second World War marked the evacuation of children from London with social comedies such as ''[[Those Kids from Town]]'' (1942) where the evacuees go to stay with an [[earl]] (a country nobleman), while in ''[[Cottage to Let]]'' (1941) and ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942) the English countryside is thick with spies.{{sfn|Murphy|2005|pp=34–35}} ''[[Gasbags]]'' (1941) offered &quot;zany, irreverent, knockabout&quot; comedy making fun of everything from [[barrage balloon]]s to [[concentration camp]]s.{{sfn|Murphy|2005|p=41}} [[Abbott and Costello]]'s ''[[Buck Privates]]'' was successful in America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=&quot;T.S.&quot;|title=Buck Privates (1941)|url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/7352/Buck-Privates/overview|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to many further wartime comedies.{{sfn|Erickson|2012|pp=''passim''}}

Japanese [[anime]] films from the 1960s onwards addressed national memories of war. ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (1988) moves from the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] to apocalyptic visions of global conflict; ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'' (1988) is elegiac on the effect of war on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Singleton |first1=Jack |title=Japanese Animation, the Pacific War and the Atomic Bomb |url=http://www.impactnottingham.com/2011/08/japanese-animation-the-pacific-war-and-the-atomic-bomb/ |publisher=Impact, University of Nottingham |accessdate=11 March 2015 |date=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Napier|2005|pp=1–3}} ''[[Barefoot Gen (1983 film)|Barefoot Gen]]'' (1983) portrays the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Barefoot Gen (movie) |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=924 |publisher=Anime News Network |accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reviewers consider it a less well made film than ''Grave of the Fireflies'' with &quot;stomach-churning detail&quot; bizarrely paired with crude artwork, giving it the look of a &quot;Saturday morning Warner Brothers cartoon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=See |first1=Raphael |title=Barefoot Gen |url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=50 |publisher=T.H.E.M.

===Anti-war===
[[File:All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film) poster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Anti-war: [[Lewis Milestone]]'s  ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', 1930]]
{{further information|List of anti-war films}}

The anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and often generically blended. [[Lewis Milestone]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film, portraying a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre) to win two Oscars, best picture and best director.&lt;ref name=BFI-Thrift/&gt; Andrew Kelly, analysing ''All Quiet on the Western Front'', defined the genre as showing: the brutality of war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of men's trust by incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove difficult to categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Stephen Neale |title=Genre and Hollywood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFPadW736NUC&amp;pg=PA117 |date=January 2000 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-02606-2 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of grisly combat in past wars, some films such as Penn's [[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]] criticized war obliquely by poking fun at such things as the draft board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paris |first1=Michael |title=The American Film Industry &amp; Vietnam |url=http://www.historytoday.com/michael-paris/american-film-industry-vietnam |journal=History Today |volume=37 |issue=4 |date=4 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of anti-war films produced in America dipped sharply during the 1950s because of [[McCarthyism]] and the Hollywood Blacklist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Film Criticism, the Cold War, and the Blacklist | jstor=10.1525/j.ctt6wqb6x | author=Smith, Jeff | publisher=University of California Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-520-95851-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the Hollywood Blacklist and the introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time of resurgence for films of all type including anti-war films in the States. Robert Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics: [[Jean Renoir]]'s  prisoner of war masterpiece&lt;ref name=BFI-Thrift/&gt; ''[[Grand Illusion (film)|La Grande Illusion]]'' (''The Grand Illusion'', 1937), and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957).{{sfn|Eberwein|2004|p=4}} The critic [[David Ehrenstein]] notes that ''Paths of Glory'' established Kubrick as the &quot;leading commercial filmmaker of his generation&quot; and a world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as an &quot;outwardly cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous French army maneuver and the courtmartial held in its wake&quot;, contrasting it with the &quot;classic&quot; ''All Quiet on the Western Front'''s story of an innocent &quot;unstrung by the horrors of war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ehrenstein |first1=David |title=Paths of Glory |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/812-paths-of-glory |publisher=The Criterion Collection |date=25 June 1989 |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed genres===
Some later war films combined [[black comedy]] and anti-war sentiment, as in the anti-war farces of [[Mike Nichols]]'s ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' (1970), based on [[Joseph Heller]]'s [[Catch-22|satirical novel]] about the Second World War, and [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), set in Korea, reflecting the attitudes of an increasingly sceptical public.&lt;ref name=NYT-Catch-22&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bozzola |first1=Lucia |title=Movies: Catch-22 (1970) |url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/8628/Catch-22/overview |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other genres were combined in [[Franklin J. Schaffner]]'s ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' (1970), about real life General [[George S. Patton]], where combat scenes were interleaved with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and bad sides to a command. It and ''MASH'' became the two most profitable war/anti-war films made up to that time;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suid2002&quot;&gt;Suid, 2002. pp. 260–277&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Patton'' won seven [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1971 |title=The 43rd Academy Awards (1971) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
