'''Lyman Enos Knapp''' (November 5, 1837 – October 9, 1904) was an American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician who was the [[List of Governors of Alaska|Governor]] of the [[District of Alaska]] from 1889 to 1893. He was also a member of the [[Vermont House of Representatives]] from 1884 to 1885. He was born in [[Somerset, Vermont]] and died in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].

==Background==
Knapp was born November 5, 1837 in [[Somerset, Vermont]] to Hiram and Elvira (Stearns) Knapp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=John Howard |title=The Cyclopaedia of American Biography |publisher=James H. Lamb|year=1901 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WLTByjPIkCwC&amp;pg=PA578|pages=578}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated in [[Manchester (town), Vermont|Manchester, Vermont]], first attending Burr and Burton Seminary and then graduating with a Bachelor of Arts from [[Middlebury College]] in 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;McMullin &amp; Walker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=McMullin |first=Thomas A. |last2=Walker |first2=David |title=Biographical Directory of American Territorial Governors |publisher=Meckler Publishing|location=Westport, CT |year=1984 | isbn = 0-930466-11-X | pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[American Civil War]] being under way at the time of his graduation, Knapp enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the Company I, [[16th Vermont Infantry]] and was quickly promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] of Company F, [[17th Vermont Infantry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;J.T. White&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=James T. White &amp; Company |title=The National cyclopaedia of American biography |volume=vol XII|publisher=J. T. White &amp; Company|location=New York |year=1904 | oclc = 17692533 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TnNMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA355 |pages=355–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his military service, he was wounded at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]].  Knapp rose to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and was [[brevetted]] a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] for his gallantry during the Siege of Petersburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt; 
On January 23, 1865, Knapp married Martha A Severance of [[Middlebury, Vermont]].  The couple had four children.&lt;ref name=&quot;J.T. White&quot;/&gt;

Following the war, Knapp returned to Vermont where he published the [[Middlebury, Vermont|Middlebury]] ''Register'' from 1865 till 1878.&lt;ref name=&quot;McMullin &amp; Walker&quot;/&gt;  In addition to the work on his own newspaper, he submitted articles to the Chicago ''Inter-Ocean'' and the ''American Law Register''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt;  Beyond his journalistic efforts, Knapp served as Clerk of the [[Vermont Legislature]] during the 1872-3 session.  After being [[admitted to the bar]] in 1876, he served as a [[probate judge]] for the [[Addison County, Vermont|Addison district]] from 1879–89.&lt;ref name=&quot;McMullin &amp; Walker&quot;/&gt;  Knapp was also elected for a term in the [[Vermont House of Representatives]] from 1884 to 1885.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herringshaw&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first = Thomas William | last = Herringshaw |title=Herringshaw's national library of American biography |volume=vol III|publisher=American Publishers' Association|location=Chicago |year=1914 | oclc = 3152314 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gRQ9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA437 |pages=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governorship==
Knapp was appointed Governor of the District of Alaska by President [[Benjamin Harrison]], his term beginning on April 20, 1889.  At the time of his appointment, many Alaskans desired a resident governor and were disappointed receiving an &quot;outsider&quot;.  The district did however see a number of improvements during his administration.  Postal service was extended with the creation of over {{convert|1600|mi|km}} of new mail routes.  Knapp also helped establish a historical society and library.&lt;ref name=&quot;J.T. White&quot;/&gt;

On the legal front, Knapp asked for Alaska to be granted a [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Delegate to the U.S. Congress]].  He also supported creation of a commission to revise the district's [[legal code]] and, arguing that lack of clear land possession discouraged improvements, lobbied for a revision of the land possession laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;McMullin &amp; Walker&quot;/&gt;  To help maintain law and order, Knapp help organize both a [[militia]] and Indian police.&lt;ref name=&quot;J.T. White&quot;/&gt;  The former turned into a source of amusement for some area residents due to the governor's predilection for dressing in his military uniform and watch the militia [[Military parade|parade]] before him.&lt;ref name=&quot;McMullin &amp; Walker&quot;/&gt;

During his term, an international dispute over [[seal fisheries]] reached a zenith.&lt;ref name=&quot;J.T. White&quot;/&gt;   The United States, claiming that seals from Alaska were being killed by Canadian and other ships on the high seas, had seized several ships and brought them to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]].  Arbitration to resolve the dispute was agreed to in 1891 between Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  As a result a set of restrictions was imposed on seal hunting near Alaska.&lt;ref name=&quot;McMullin &amp; Walker&quot;/&gt; Knapp was replaced as governor on August 29, 1893 following the appointment of [[James Sheakley]] by President [[Grover Cleveland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McMullin &amp; Walker&quot;/&gt;

==After office==
Following his term as governor, Knapp moved to [[Seattle]] and opened a law practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt;  He was active in civil organizations such as the Institute of Civics and [[National Geographic Society]] and received an Honorary [[LL.D.]] from [[Whitman College]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=&quot;J.T. White&quot;/&gt;  Knapp was also the founder and President of the [[Anti-Saloon League]] of Washington.  He remained active in the practice of law until his death on October 9, 1904.&lt;ref name=&quot;McMullin &amp; Walker&quot;/&gt;
