'''Barrington Dacres''' (died 25 October 1806) was an officer of the [[Royal Navy]], who saw service during the [[French Revolutionary War|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]].  He eventually rose to the rank of [[Post-Captain]]. He did not see action in many significant engagements, and is chiefly remembered for the accidental loss of his ship to the French, and for the unsuccessful chase of two French ships in the [[English Channel]]. He did command a number of [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] under several of the leading naval commanders of his time. His early death though prevented him from achieving the same seniority and degree of fame as his relatives did.

==Family and early life==
Barrington was born the eldest son of Captain, later Vice-Admiral, [[James Richard Dacres (1749–1810)|James Richard Dacres]], and his wife Eleanor Blandford Pearce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whos Who108&quot;/&gt;  The Dacres would eventually become a substantial naval dynasty. Barrington's brother [[James Richard Dacres (1788–1853)|James Richard Dacres]] became a vice-admiral, as did Barrington's uncle [[Richard Dacres (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Dacres]], while his cousin [[Sydney Dacres]] became an admiral, and [[First Sea Lord]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whos Who108&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Tracy  |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Barrington Dacres took command of the newly converted [[bomb vessel]] {{HMS|Bulldog|1782|6}} in 1799.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield282&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in command until 27 February 1801, when he put in to the Italian port of [[Ancona]], unaware that it had been captured by the French.&lt;ref name=&quot;James&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James  |title=The naval history of Great Britain|page=482}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French seized the ''Bulldog.  Captain Thomas Rogers of''  {{HMS|Mercury|1779|6}} attempted to recapture the ''Bulldog'' by cutting her out of the port.  Although Rogers nearly successful, the British were forced to abandon her again.&lt;ref name=&quot;James-2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |title=Battles of the British Navy|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was finally retaken off [[Gallipoli]] on 16 September 1801 by [[Lord William Stuart]]'s {{HMS|Champion|1779|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield282&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;James&quot;/&gt; Dacres's career does not appear to have been particularly adversely affected by the accidental loss of his ship. He was promoted to [[Post-Captain]] on 29 April 1802.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schomberg380&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schomberg|title=Naval Chronology |page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took command of the 74-gun [[third rate]] {{HMS|Culloden|1783|6}} in May 1803, and recommissioned her in July that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield80&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June, he captured the ''Petronelle.''&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15778|startpage=181|date=5 February 1805|accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September, he was cruising in the [[English Channel]] as part of [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Sir Edward Pellew's]] squadron, when the French 74-gun [[HMS Implacable (1805)|''Duguay-Trouin'']] was spotted sailing in company with the 38-gun [[frigate]] [[HMS Guerriere (1806)|''Guerrière'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cust167&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cust |title=Annals of the Wars of the Nineteenth Century|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had already been engaged by {{HMS|Boadicea|1797|6}}, under Captain [[John Maitland (Royal Navy officer)|John Maitland]], but the French ships had driven her off and were now bound for [[A Coruña|Corunna]]. Dacres took the ''Culloden'' in pursuit, eventually closing the distance and opening fire. The ''Duguay-Trouin'' was first to reach the safety of the port, but Dacres continued to engage the ''Guerrière'' until he was almost under the guns of the shore batteries. He eventually veered away, having inflicted considerable damage and several casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield80&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cust167&quot;/&gt; Dacres remained in command of ''Culloden'' until being succeeded by Captain George Reynolds in February 1804.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield80&quot;/&gt;

Dacres then took command of the 74-gun {{HMS|Venerable|1784|6}} in February, and was involved in the blockade of [[Brest, France|Brest]], under Rear-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield77&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|John Hunter]] in August 1804. By January 1805, Dacres was briefly aboard {{HMS|Theseus|1786|6}}, taking over from Captain Francis Temple, but by March, Temple was back in command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield78&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took command of [[French ship Hercule (1798)|HMS ''Hercule'']], capturing a number of merchant vessels carrying sugar on 9 July 1806.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16159|startpage=931|date=2 July 1808|accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Barrington Dacres appears to have been in poor health and died at [[Bath, Somerset]] on 25 October 1806.&lt;ref name=&quot;UM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Universal Magazine|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The European Magazine, and London Review]]|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; He predeceased his father, who died in January 1810.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whos Who108&quot;/&gt;
