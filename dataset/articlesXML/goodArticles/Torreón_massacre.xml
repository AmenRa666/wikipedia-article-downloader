The '''Torreón massacre''' was a racially motivated [[massacre]] that took place on 13–15 May 1911 in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Torreón]], [[Coahuila]].  Over 300 [[Chinese people|Chinese]] residents were killed by the revolutionary forces of [[Francisco I. Madero]]. A large number of Chinese homes and establishments were looted and destroyed.

Torreón was the last major city to be taken by the [[Factions in the Mexican Revolution#Maderistas|Maderistas]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]].  When the government forces withdrew, the rebels entered the city in the early morning and began a ten-hour massacre of the Chinese community. The event touched off a diplomatic crisis between [[China]] and Mexico, with the former demanding 30 million [[Mexican peso|pesos]] in reparation.  At one point it was rumored that China had even dispatched a warship to Mexican waters (the cruiser ''[[Chinese cruiser Hai Chi|Hai Chi]]'', which was anchored in [[Cuba]] at the time). An investigation into the massacre concluded that it was an unprovoked act of racial hatred.

== Background ==
{{anchor|Background}}
[[Chinese immigration to Mexico]] began as early as the 17th century, with a number settling in [[Mexico City]].  Immigration increased when Mexican president [[Porfirio Díaz]] attempted to encourage foreign investment and tourism to boost the country's economy.  The two countries signed a [[China–Mexico relations#History|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] in 1899;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz59&quot;&gt;Schwartz (1998) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques234&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;  over time, the Chinese expatriates began to establish profitable businesses such as wholesale and retail groceries.  By 1910, there were 13,200 Chinese immigrants in the country, many living in [[Baja California]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Sonora]], and [[Yucatán]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques234&quot; /&gt;

[[Torreón]] was an attractive destination for immigrants at the turn of the nineteenth century.  It was located at the intersection of two major railroads (the [[Mexican Central Railway]] and the [[Mexican International Railroad]]) and was proximate to the [[Nazas River]], which irrigated the surrounding area, making it a suitable location for growing [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB83&quot;&gt;Lai &amp; Chee-Beng (2010) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese probably began to arrive in Torreón during the 1880s or 1890s, at the same time that other immigrants were first recorded as coming to the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB85&quot;&gt;Lai &amp; Chee-Beng (2010) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  By about 1900, 500 of the city's 14,000 residents were Chinese. The Chinese community was easily the largest and most notable group of immigrants in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB84&quot;&gt;Lai &amp; Chee-Beng (2010) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1903, it had formed the largest branch of the [[Baohuanghui]] (Protect the Emperor Society) in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz57&quot;&gt;Schwartz (1998) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Kang Youwei.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=A Chinese man with a shaved head and mustache wearing formal attire.|right|A portrait of [[Kang Youwei]] from 1906 or earlier.]] 
Mexico was one of the countries visited by [[Kang Youwei]] after his exile from China.  He had recently founded the [[China Reform Association]] to restore the [[Guangxu Emperor]] to power, and was visiting Chinese colonies worldwide to fund the Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB85&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques234-236&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) pp. 234—236&lt;/ref&gt;  He arrived in 1906, and purchased a few blocks of real estate in Torreón for 1,700 [[Mexican peso|pesos]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques234-236&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB86&quot;&gt;Lai &amp; Chee-Beng (2010) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; later reselling it to Chinese immigrants for a profit of 3,400 pesos.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB86&quot; /&gt;  This investment spurred Kang to have the Association establish a bank in Torreón, which began selling stock and real estate to Chinese businessmen.  The bank also built the city's first [[tram]] line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques234-236&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB86&quot; /&gt;  Kang visited Torreón again in 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques234-236&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB86&quot; /&gt;  It has been suggested that the city served as a test case for Chinese immigration to Mexico and [[Brazil]], which Kang believed might solve [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] problems in the Chinese [[Pearl River Delta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz60&quot;&gt;Schwartz (1998) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon there were 600 Chinese living in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz59&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques236&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, a number of Mexican businessman gathered to form a chamber of commerce to protect their businesses from the foreigners.  Instead of targeting Chinese specifically, they wrote:
{{quote|We cannot compete against the foreigners in commercial ventures.  The sad and lamentable fact is that the prostration of our national commerce has created a situation in which Mexicans are replaced by foreign individuals and companies, which monopolize our commerce and behave in the manner of conquerors in a conquered land.|''El Nuevo Mundo''&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB86&quot; /&gt;}}

Tensions and resentment of the Chinese ran high among the Mexican populace of Torreón, stemming from the immigrants' prosperity and monopoly over the grocery trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques236-237&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) pp. 236–237&lt;/ref&gt;  Nationwide resentment of the Chinese has also, conversely, been attributed to the fact that the Chinese represented a source of cheap-labor which was central to the Porfirian economic program.  Therefore, opposing the Chinese was an indirect way to oppose the dictatorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz57&quot; /&gt;

[[Sinophobia|Anti-Chinese sentiments]] were apparent in the [[Grito de Dolores|Independence Day]] speeches and demonstrations of 16 September 1910.  Over the next several weeks a number of Chinese establishments were vandalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques236-237&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero149&quot;&gt;Romero (2010) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 1911 ([[Cinco de Mayo]]), a revolutionary leader,&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero149&quot; /&gt; a [[bricklayer]]&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB87&quot;&gt;Lai &amp; Chee-Beng (2010) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; or [[stonemason]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero149&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Y201&quot;&gt;Young (2014) p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; named Jesús C. Flores, made a public speech in nearby [[Gómez Palacio, Durango]], in which he claimed that the Chinese were putting Mexican women out of jobs, had monopolized the gardening and grocery businesses, were accumulating vast amounts of money to send back to China, and were &quot;vying for the affection and companionship of local women.&quot;  He concluded by demanding that all people of Chinese origin be expelled from Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques237&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;  One witness recalled him stating &quot;that, therefore, it was necessary... even a patriotic duty, to finish with them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero150&quot;&gt;Romero (2010) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The branch of the reform association in Torreón heard of Flores speech, and on 12 May the society's secretary, Woo Lam Po (also the manager of the bank) circulated a letter in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] among the leaders of the community warning that there could be violence:
{{quote|text=Brothers, attention!  Attention!  This is serious.  Many unjust acts have happened during the revolution.  Notice have [sic] been received that before 10 o'clock today the revolutionists will unite their forces and attack the city.  It is very probable that during the battle a mob will spring up and sack the stores.  For this reason, we advise all our people, when the crowds assemble, to close your door and hide yourself and under no circumstances open your places for business or go outside to see the fighting.  And if any of your stores are broken into, offer no resistance but allow them to take what they please, since otherwise you might endanger your lives.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.  After the trouble is over we will try to arrange a settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB87&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero150&quot; /&gt;}}

On the morning of Saturday, 13 May, the forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]] led by [[Francisco I. Madero]]'s brother [[Emilio Madero]] attacked the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques238&quot;&gt;Jaques (1974) p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero150-1&quot;&gt;Romero (2010) pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;  Its railroads made it a key strategic point necessary to seizing complete control of the surrounding region:&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques233&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; it was also the last major city to be targeted by the rebels.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB82&quot;&gt;Lai &amp; Chee-Beng (2010) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  Madero and 4,500 [[Factions in the Mexican Revolution#Maderistas|Maderistas]] surrounded the city, hemming in General {{Interlanguage link multi|Emiliano Lojero|es}} and his 670 [[Federales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques238&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero151&quot;&gt;Romero (2010) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  They overran the Chinese gardens surrounding the city, killing 112 of the people working there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero151&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB88&quot;&gt;Lai &amp; Chee-Beng (2010) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese houses were used as fortifications for the advancing rebels, and the people living there were forced to prepare them food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero151&quot; /&gt;  The fighting continued until the Federales began to run low on [[munitions]] on Sunday evening.  Lojero ordered a retreat, and his forces abandoned the city under cover of darkness between two and four in the morning on Monday, 15 May, during a heavy rainstorm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques238&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB82&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero151&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight207&quot;&gt;Knight (1986) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;  The retreat was so sudden that some troops were left behind during the evacuation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight207&quot; /&gt;  Before the rebels entered the city, witnesses reported that xenophobic speeches had been made to incense the accompanying mob against foreigners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Delgado105&quot;&gt;Delgado (2012) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesús Flores was present, and made a speech calling the Chinese &quot;dangerous competitors&quot; and concluded &quot;that it would be best to exterminate them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight207&quot; /&gt;

=== Massacre ===
{{anchor|Massacre|The massacre}}
The rebel forces entered the city at six o'clock, accompanied by a mob of over 4,000 men, women, and children from [[Gómez Palacio Municipality]], [[Viesca Municipality]], [[San Pedro Municipality, Coahuila|San Pedro Municipality]], [[Lerdo Municipality]], and [[Matamoros Municipality, Coahuila|Matamoros Municipality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques238&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero151&quot; /&gt;  They were joined by citizens of Torreón and began the sacking of the [[Central business district|business district]].  The mob released prisoners from jail, looted stores, and attacked people on the street.  They soon moved to the [[Chinatown|Chinese district]].  Men on horses drove Chinese from the gardens back into town, dragging them by their [[Queue (hairstyle)|queues]] and shooting or trampling those who fell.  Men, women, and children were killed indiscriminately when they fell in the way of the mob, and their bodies were robbed and mutilated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques238&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB88&quot; /&gt;  It was reported that &quot;[i]n one instance the head of a Chinaman was severed from his body and thrown from the window into the street.  In another instance a soldier took a little boy by the heels and battered his brains out against a lamp post.  In many instances ropes were tied to the bodies of the Chinamen and they were dragged through the streets by men on horseback.  In another instance a Chinaman was pulled to pieces in the street by horses hitched to his arms and legs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delgado105&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero152&quot;&gt;Romero (2010) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;  The mob finally reached the bank, where they killed the employees and hurled their severed body parts into the streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques239&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;  A contemporary newspaper reported that &quot;heads of the murdered Chinese were rolled along the streets, and their bodies were tied to the tails of horses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=June 12, 1911 |title=Mexico and China: The Torreon Massacre |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15225039 |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=2 December 2014 |via=[[National Library of Australia|Trove]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of residents made attempts to save the Chinese from the mob.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques240&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;  Seventy immigrants were saved by a tailor who stood atop the roof of a building where they were hiding and misdirected the mob that was hunting for them.  Eleven were saved by Hermina Almaráz, the daughter of a Maderista leader, who told soldiers who wanted to take them from her home &quot;that they could only enter the house over her dead body.&quot;  Another eight were saved by a second tailor, who stood in the rain in front of the laundry they worked at and lied to the rebels about their presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero153-4&quot;&gt;Romero (2010) pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten hours after the massacre had begun, at around four o'clock, Emilio Madero arrived in Torreón on horseback and issued a proclamation decreeing the death penalty for anyone who killed a Chinese.  This ended the massacre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques239&quot; /&gt;

=== After the massacre ===
{{anchor|After the massacre}}
Madero collected the surviving Chinese in a building and posted a hand-picked group of soldiers to protect them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques240&quot; /&gt;  Dead Mexicans were buried in the city's cemetery, but the bodies of the slain Chinese were stripped naked and [[Mass grave|buried together]] in a trench.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques240&quot; /&gt;

The same day as the massacre, Madero convened a [[Military justice|military tribunal]] to hear testimony about the killings.  The tribunal came to the conclusion that the Maderistas had &quot;committed atrocities&quot;, but the soldiers defended themselves by asserting that the Chinese had been armed and the massacre was an act of self-defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques241&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the United States Consulate and the local Relief Committee began collecting donations from locals to support the Chinese.  Between 17 May and 1 June, Dr. J. Lim and the Relief Committee collected over $6,000 dollars which they distributed at a rate of $30 per day to provide food and shelter for the survivors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques240&quot; /&gt;

After the massacre, large numbers of Chinese fled Torreón, with ''El Imparcial'', a daily newspaper in [[Mexico City]], reporting that over 1,000 people were on the move.  Chinese began to arrive in [[Guadalajara]] seeking passage back to China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques240&quot; /&gt;

Property stolen from Torreón continued to appear on the black market in [[San Pedro, Coahuila|San Pedro]] for several months following the massacre and looting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight208&quot;&gt;Knight (1986) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

308 Asians were killed in the massacre; 303 Chinese and 5 Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Delgado104&quot;&gt;Delgado (2012) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero148&quot;&gt;Romero (2010) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[British Empire|British]] Vice [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] in Gómez Palacio, the Japanese were killed &quot;owing to the similarity of features&quot; with the Chinese.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCB88&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques239&quot; /&gt;  It is estimated that the dead made up nearly one-half of the Chinese population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero152&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delgado104&quot; /&gt;

Among the dead were 50 employees of Sam Wah, both from his [[Hacienda|estate]] and his restaurant; Wong Foon-chuck lost 45 employees: 32 from his estate, nine from a railroad hotel that he operated, and four from his laundry; and Ma Due lost 38 out of the 40 workers from his gardens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques239-40&quot;&gt;Jacques (1947) pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt;  25 employees of the bank were also killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot; /&gt;

Rebels, Federales, and bystanders were also killed;&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight208&quot; /&gt; according to contemporary reports, these included 25 Federales, 34 bystanders (including 12 Spaniards and a German),&lt;ref name=&quot;SpokesmanReview&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=26 May 1911 |title=Chinese Slain By Mob In Mexico |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19110526&amp;id=4AFkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q_MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6647,1771599 |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |location=Spokane, Washington |page=6 |accessdate=4 January 2015 |via=[[Google News Archive]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 26 Maderistas.&lt;ref name=&quot;EastOregonian&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=23 May 1911 |title=Foreign Powers May Become Involved In Revolution: Massacre At Torron Cause |url=http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn88086023/1911-05-23/ed-1/seq-1.pdf |newspaper=[[East Oregonian]] |volume=24 |issue=7220 |location=Pendleton, Oregon |accessdate=4 January 2015 |via=[[University of Oregon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the dead was Jesús Flores,&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight208&quot; /&gt; apparently killed while attempting to free a [[machine gun]] abandoned by the government forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;EastOregonian&quot; /&gt;

Bombs had been thrown on the roof, the windows and doors either destroyed or stolen, the machinery broken to pieces and everything that could be carted away, stolen....  The Puerto de Shanghai building was next visited.  All of the doors and windows of the building were destroyed.  The Chinese Bank, which had been moved into this building a few months before, was demolished, safes blown open and contents taken, furniture destroyed, all papers and valuables stolen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero152&quot; /&gt;}}

American, [[Saudi Arabia|Arabian]], German, Spanish, and [[Turkey|Turkish]] establishments were also damaged and destroyed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques239&quot; /&gt; but in contrast to the Chinese, U.S. properties were only dealt US$22,000 (${{inflation|US|22,000|1911|fmt=c}} today) in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight208&quot; /&gt;

Other properties destroyed included a [[casino]], the city courthouse,&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight208&quot; /&gt; the jail, the police headquarters, the Inferior Court, the Court of Letters, and the Municipal Treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero151&quot; /&gt;

A month afterward, the Chinese government hired American attorney [[Lebbeus R. Wilfley|Lebbeus Wilfley]] to conduct an investigation into the massacre.  Wilfley owned a [[law firm]] in Mexico City, and had previously served as the United States Attorney General to the Philippines and as Judge of the United States Court in China.  In June he dispatched his partner, Arthur Bassett, to carry out the investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques241&quot; /&gt;

The same month, China demanded reparation from Mexico, seeking a payment 100,000 pesos (in 1911 money) for each Chinese killed during the massacre, a total of over thirty million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques243&quot;/&gt;  The country also demanded an official apology from the Mexican government.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot; /&gt;

The words &quot;HAI CHI CHINA&quot; are visible in the upper right-hand corner of the photo, along with what appears to be the imprint of a stamp.|The ''[[Chinese cruiser Hai Chi|Hai Chi]]'' in 1911.]]
This was followed by a diplomatic crisis, when a rumor began to circulate that China had dispatched a warship carrying investigators to Mexican waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JOE&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques243-4&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) pp. 243–244&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Ambassador to Mexico|U.S. Ambassador to Mexico]], [[Henry Lane Wilson]], sent a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] to [[Philander C. Knox]], the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], claiming that the Chinese [[gunboat]] ''Korea'' was en route for Mexico.  Yuan Kwai, a Chinese diplomat in [[Washington, D.C.]], sought the support of the [[United States Department of State]].  He was told that the U.S. would not approve the act, but would not make an attempt to halt it, either.  Failing to get support from the U.S., China announced that the rumor was false.  Yuan Kwai stated that the [[cruiser]] ''[[Chinese cruiser Hai Chi|Hai Chi]]'' might dock in Mexico after attending the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of [[George V]] in [[London]].  In the event, the ''Hai Chi'' docked in Cuba after visiting the United States and halted there while the diplomatic crisis played out, and did not go on to Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques243-4&quot; /&gt;

In July, U.S. consul George Carothers reported that a number of foreigners in Torreón had received letters telling them to leave the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques240-1&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt;

Madero had ordered that the soldiers culpable for the killings be arrested and put on trial, and by 9 July 20 of the 35 under suspicion of connection with the massacre had been captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques244&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Bassett made his report to Chang Yin Tang, the Chinese Minister to Mexico, on 13 July, after conducting interviews with a number of Chinese and Mexican witnesses to the massacre.  He concluded that the Maderistas' claims (that they had been fired on by the Chinese) were false, citing the 12 May circular by the reform society.  He also dismissed the claim that the immigrants had been armed by General Lojero and his retreating Federales, pointing out that the reason for the evacuation was a dearth of ammunition.  Furthermore, no witnesses reported any form of resistance by the Chinese.  In his report, he called the incident &quot;an unprovoked massacre... conceived in ''malice'' and ''race hatred''&quot; and concluded that it was a clear violation of the 1899 treaty between the two countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques242&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassett, in collaboration with Owang King (a representative for China) and Antonio Ramos Pedrueza (representing Mexican President [[Francisco León de la Barra]]), tendered a second report to Chang on 28 August, once again attempting to assess whether the Chinese themselves had prompted the massacre by resisting the Madistera troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques242&quot; /&gt;  The editor of ''Diogenes'', a local paper, stated that Lojero had &quot;authorized him to deny all allegations&quot; that he may have armed the Chinese.  Upon further inquiry, the owners of local stores testified that they had not sold weapons to Chinese patrons before the massacre.  The report concluded:
{{quote|The contention that the Chinese offered resistance is pure fabrication, invented by the officers of the revolutionary army for the sole purpose of escaping the punishment which the commission of such a heinous crime would naturally entail upon them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques243&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After failing to gain support from the United States, China reduced the demanded [[indemnity]] from thirty million to six million.  However, it continued to demand an official apology, a guarantee of the safety of Chinese citizens in Mexico, and the punishment of the soldiers responsible for the massacre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques244&quot; /&gt;

As the 1911 Mexican Independence Day approached, the foreign community in Torreón became restless, remembering the violence that had broken out at that time the previous year.  To prevent another outbreak of violence, Francisco Madero sent 1,000 troops to the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques241&quot; /&gt;

China and Mexico came to an agreement in November 1912, and a treaty was signed wherein Mexico granted 3,100,000 pesos in damages to China and extended an official apology.  The deadline for payment was later extended to 15 February 1913.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques244-5&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) pp. 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after the February 1913 assassination of Francisco Madero, Mexico entered a period of [[Economic history of Mexico#Economic woes and the Great Depression|economic collapse]].  They proposed to pay China in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].  The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ambassador warned against it, believing that Mexico would be unable to obtain the foreign loans necessary for payment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques245&quot;&gt;Jacques (1974) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Senate of the Republic (Mexico)|Mexican Senate]] debated a number of ways to pay the indemnity through 1912 and 1913, including considering payment in [[silver]].  However, the bonds were never approved, and reparation was never made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacques245&quot; /&gt;

The massacre in Torreón was not the only instance of race violence against the Chinese during the revolution.  In the first year alone, rebels and other Mexican citizens contributed to the deaths of some 324 Chinese.  By 1919, another 129 had been killed in Mexico City, and 373 in [[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Delgado105&quot; /&gt;  The persecution and violence against the Chinese in Mexico finally culminated in 1931, with the expulsion of the remaining Chinese from Sonora.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reejhsinghani2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reejhsinghani |first=Anju |date=Spring 2014 |title=Emerging Transnational Scholarship: Chinese Mexicans in China, Mexico, and the United States-Mexico Borderlands |jstor=10.5406/jamerethnhist.33.3.0077 |journal=Journal of American Ethnic History |volume=33 |issue=3 |page=79  |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
