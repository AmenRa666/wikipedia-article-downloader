The '''39th Battalion''' was an [[infantry]] unit of the [[Australian Army]]. It was originally raised in February 1916 for service during [[World War I]] as part of [[First Australian Imperial Force]]. Making up part of the [[10th Brigade (Australia)|10th Brigade]], it was attached to the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] and served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France and Belgium before being disbanded in March 1919. Following the re-organisation of the Australian Army in 1921, the battalion was raised again as a unit of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Force]], known as the &quot;Hawthorn–Kew Regiment&quot;. In 1937, it was amalgamated with the [[37th Battalion (Australia)|37th Battalion]] to become the 37th/39th Battalion. Later it was delinked with the 37th and amalgamated with the [[24th Battalion (Australia)|24th Battalion]] to form the 24th/39th Battalion, before being raised again as a single unit in October 1941. During [[World War II]] the battalion was sent to [[New Guinea]] in 1942 and between July and August of that year the unit was heavily engaged in the defence of the [[Kokoda Trail]] during which time they fought several desperate actions against the Japanese as they attempted to hold out until further reinforcements could be brought up from Port Moresby. Such was their involvement in the battle that by the time they were withdrawn they could only muster 32 men and following its return to Australia, the unit was disbanded in early July 1943.

==History==

===World War I===

====Formation====
The 39th Battalion was first formed on 21 February 1916 at the [[Ballarat]] Showgrounds, in Victoria, for service during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name =AWM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11226.asp|title=39th Battalion |work=First World War, 1914–1918 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Rankine,&lt;ref&gt;Paterson 1934, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; the battalion was raised as part of an expansion of the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] (1st AIF) that took place at the conclusion of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Grey 2008, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the battalion's recruits came from the Western District of Victoria, and together with the 37th, [[38th Battalion (Australia)|38th]] and [[40th Battalion (Australia)|40th Battalions]], it formed the [[10th Brigade (Australia)|10th Brigade]], which was part of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]].&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; Following a brief period of training in Ballarat, the 39th Battalion marched through Melbourne on 15 May as the city farewelled the unit and they subsequently embarked upon HMAT ''Ascanius'' on 27 May 1916, bound for the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson 1934, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Sailing via Cape Town, the battalion landed at Plymouth on 18 July 1916, and moved by train to Amesbury, before marching to Larkhill on [[Salisbury Plain]], where they undertook a period of four months training before being sent to France in November.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; After completing the Channel crossing on 23/24 November, they landed at Le Havre and moved to the front by train. On the night of 10 December, the battalion took its place in the trenches along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], relieving its sister battalion, the 37th, around Houplines in the Armentieres sector.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; They remained at the front for the next week, as part of their introduction to trench warfare, during which time the battalion repelled a small German raid and sent out patrols into &quot;no man's land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson 1934, pp. 63–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Front====
[[File:AWM E00086 39th Battalion France December 1916.jpg|thumb|right|A member of the 39th Battalion in the trenches near Houplines, December 1916|alt=A soldier carrying a rifle standing in a trench]]
After having endured a long winter in Flanders serving in mainly a defensive role, the battalion's first major engagement came at [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines]], in Belgium in early June 1917. The battle began badly for the 39th. Near Ploegsteert Corner,&lt;ref&gt;Bean 1941, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; during the march to the line of departure, the battalion suffered a high number of casualties following a German gas attack which subsequently resulted the 39th only being able to muster about a third of its manpower for the attack,&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; amounting to an assault force of only 120 men. Despite this, the 39th was quickly reorganised into a single wave,&lt;ref&gt;Bean 1941, p. 591.&lt;/ref&gt; and attacking on the 10th Brigade's right,&lt;ref&gt;Bean 1941, p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt; it subsequently overcame the initial German opposition facing them and then, during the second phase of the battle advanced south of Douve, on the southern edge of the Messines Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Bean 1941, p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt; It was involved in further fighting north of Grey Farm, where they were initially held up by German machine-gun fire, but after this was overcome they continued to advance to their final objective, eventually digging-in {{convert|100|yd|m}} beyond the farm,&lt;ref&gt;Bean 1941, p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; having managed to capture all of its objectives.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; Later, in October, the 39th Battalion took part in two other major attacks in that same sector, firstly at [[Battle of Broodseinde|Broodseinde]] and then at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], the first of which was a brilliant success, while the second was a disastrous failure.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

During the fighting around Broodseinde on 4 October, the 39th formed the third wave of the 10th Brigade's attack, which went in around 6:00&amp;nbsp;am. Following up the 37th and 38th Battalions, they advanced against strongly held pill-boxes towards the Gravenstafel Switch. After digging-in, a party from the 39th joined the 40th Battalion as it launched the final wave in the brigade's attack. As the 40th came up against stiff opposition, more men from the 39th were pushed forward and the objective was finally secured around 11:00&amp;nbsp;am. After the battle, the 39th remained in the line until 6 October, when it was withdrawn back to Morbecque for reorganisation and rest.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson 1934, pp. 137&amp;ndash;149.&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of days later, the battalion was recommitted to the fighting and ordered to advance towards Passchendaele Ridge, attacking on the morning of 12 October despite heavy rain the previous evening. In the heavy fighting that followed, the battalion managed to secure its first objective, but was forced to withdraw when its flanks became threatened as neighbouring units had been unable to advance with them through the thick mud.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson 1934, pp. 151&amp;ndash;159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the next five months, the 39th Battalion rotated between the front line and rear areas, holding the line in Belgium throughout winter.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson 1934, pp. 163–177.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1918, when the German Army launched its last effort at victory, known as the [[Spring Offensive]], the 39th was among the many Australian battalions that were hurriedly moved south to France in order to stem the tide of the German onslaught towards [[Amiens]];&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; fighting a series of defensive actions in the Somme between late March and early June.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson 1934, pp. 179–202.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Allies launched their own offensive – the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] – on 8 August 1918, the battalion along with the rest of the 10th Brigade, was serving as the divisional reserve and they did not participate in the advance that has since become known as one of the greatest days for the Allies on the Western Front.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; On 10 August, the battalion was committed to battle once more, undertaking an attack on the village of Proyart, but this attack was ill-conceived and ultimately failed. Despite this, the battalion remained in the line throughout August and early September as the 3rd Division advanced through the Somme Valley.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

The battalion undertook its last major action of the war at the end of September 1918 when, serving alongside the Americans, they breached parts of the [[Hindenburg Line]] along the [[Battle of the St Quentin Canal|St Quentin Canal]]. During this final battle, the battalion's long serving commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Henderson, who had taken command in February 1917 before the battalion's first major battle, was killed in action.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson 1934, pp. 92 &amp; 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Late on 2 October, while around Gillemont Crescent, the 39th was relieved and the battalion was removed from the line to undertake training and reorganisation. In the middle of October, the 39th was bolstered by a company of reinforcements from the 37th, which had been disbanded to help make up losses in the other 10th Brigade units.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson 1934, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the 39th did not see action again and they were still at the rear when the [[Armistice]] was declared on 11 November 1918. With the fighting over, the process of demobilisation began and slowly the men began marching out for repatriation to Australia. Finally, in March 1919, the 39th Battalion was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/diaries/ww1/folder.asp?folder=980|title=AWM4 23/56/1-23/56/36: 39th Battalion, AIF, War Diary&amp;nbsp;– March 1919|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the battalion's remaining personnel were amalgamated with other units to form the 10th Demobilisation Regiment, with the last of its soldiers returning to Australia in May.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson 1934, pp. 247&amp;ndash;248.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of the war the 39th Battalion suffered 405 men killed, while a further 1,637 were wounded.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (MBE), two [[Distinguished Service Order]]s (DSOs), 14 [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]]s (DCMs), 14 [[Military Cross]]es (MCs), 78 [[Military Medal]]s (MMs) with three [[Medal bar|bars]], and 22 [[Mention in Dispatches|Mentions in Dispatches]] (MIDs).&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; For their involvement in the fighting on the Western Front, the 39th Battalion were awarded 14 [[battle honour]]s in 1927.&lt;ref name=Festberg97-98&gt;Festberg 1972, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-war years===
At the end of World War I there was a wholesale disbandment of units of the Australian Army as the wartime Army was disbanded and its personnel demobilised. In 1921, it was decided that there was a need to raise a part-time military force, known as the [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Force]], which would take responsibility for the defence of the Australian mainland.&lt;ref name =AWM2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11908.asp|title=39th Battalion (Hawthorn Kew Regiment) |work=Second World War, 1939–1945 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This force was organised along the same lines of the 1st AIF, and the units raised kept the same numerical designation as the 1st AIF battalions.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; The AIF ceased to exist officially on 1 April 1921, and the Citizens Force was reorganised the following month on 1 May, adopting the numerical designations and structures of the AIF.&lt;ref&gt;Grey 2008, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of this, the 39th Battalion  was raised in 1921 in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; Upon formation, the battalion was attached to the 10th Brigade, 3rd Division,&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo 2002, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and the battalion drew personnel from the 22nd and 24th Infantry Regiments and the 29th Light Horse.&lt;ref name=Festberg97/&gt;

In 1927, territorial designations were adopted and the battalion assumed the title of the &quot;Hawthorn Regiment&quot;. Three years later this was changed to the &quot;Hawthorne–Kew Regiment&quot;.&lt;ref name=regiments&gt;{{cite web|author=Mills, T.F |archiveurl=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20051227053357/regiments.org/regiments/australia/volmil/vic-inf/39HawKew.htm |url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/australia/volmil/vic-inf/39HawKew.htm  |title=39th Battalion (The Hawthorne–Kew Regiment) |work= Land Forces of Britain, The Empire and Commonwealth |publisher=Regiments.org |archivedate=27 December 2005 |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumed the motto of ''Factis Non Verbis'' in 1927.&lt;ref name=Festberg98&gt;Festberg 1972, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the battalion was kept up to strength with volunteers and men serving under the terms of the [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory training scheme]], but in 1929 the scheme was suspended by the newly elected [[James Scullin|Scullin]] Labor government and the Citizen Forces were renamed the Militia.&lt;ref name=Palazzo110&gt;Palazzo 2001, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the end to compulsory training and the financial hardships of the [[Great Depression]] meant that there were few volunteers available as men could not risk losing their jobs to undertake training and as a result throughout the 1930s a number of units were amalgamated or disbanded as the size of the Army was reduced.&lt;ref name=Palazzo110/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keogh 1965, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937,  the 39th Battalion was merged with the 37th Battalion, before later being delinked with the 37th and being amalgamated with the 24th Battalion, becoming the 24th/39th Battalion.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt;&lt;ref name=orders&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=6756&amp;Tab=Uhi&amp;Titl=39%20Infantry%20Battalion |title=39 Infantry Battalion |publisher=Orders of Battle.com |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alliance with the [[Dorsetshire Regiment]] was approved in 1930.&lt;ref name=Festberg98/&gt;

===World War II===

====Formation====
On 1 October 1941, the Australian Military Board issued an order re-raising the 39th Battalion as a single battalion of the Australian Military Forces, as Militiamen were called up for national service.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1988, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to raise the battalion to relieve the Queensland-based [[49th Battalion (Australia)|49th Battalion]], which was serving as a garrison force around [[Port Moresby]],&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1988, pp. 8 &amp; 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and from the outset the battalion was formed from men who were transferred from a variety of infantry and light horse units, including the 24th/39th Battalion that had been deployed at Nagambie Road, in [[Seymour, Victoria]],&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1988, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as elements from the Militia 2nd Cavalry and 3rd and 4th Infantry Divisions.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy 1959, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=39bnweb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.39battalion.org/History.html|title=Some History of the 39th Australian Infantry Battalion|publisher=39th Australian Infantry Battalion Association|accessdate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Conran became the battalion's new commanding officer, having previously served with the [[23rd Battalion (Australia)|23rd Battalion]] during World War I, and in the Citizens Military Force after the war.&lt;ref name=AWMconran&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1080701.asp|title=Hugh Marcell Conran|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battalion headquarters was opened at Darley Camp, near [[Bacchus Marsh]],&lt;ref name=Austin9&gt;Austin 1988, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 8 October 1941, a nucleus of officers and senior [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs), many of whom had experience from World War I, had prepared the battalion for the arrival of the soldiers or [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]] (ORs) that would bring it up to its required establishment. On 10 October 1941, the first draft of nine officers and 523 men from the 3rd Infantry Division assembled at [[Caulfield Racecourse]] Transit Camp and were transported by rail to Darley Camp.&lt;ref name=Austin9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/war_diaries/second_world_war/diary.asp?levelID=1012|title=AWM52-8-3-78: 39th Battalion, AMF, War Diary&amp;nbsp;– 10 October 1941|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day numbers increased further with the arrival of another seven officers and 400 men from the 2nd Cavalry and 4th Infantry Divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/war_diaries/second_world_war/diary.asp?levelID=1012|title=AWM52-8-3-78: 39th Battalion, AMF, War Diary&amp;nbsp;– 11 October 1941|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1988, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in June 1942, after it had arrived in New Guinea, the battalion's strength was bolstered with the transfer of 16 officers from the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (2nd AIF), including a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel [[William T. Owen|William Owen]].&lt;ref&gt;Brune 2003, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 1941, the 39th Battalion paraded through the streets of Melbourne with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1988, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; It had taken 52 days to form the battalion and while the battalion had still been understrength, they were declared ready for training. In the end, however, as events in the Pacific unfolded, this training was cut short and the battalion was only able to undertake one training exercise in this time. This exercise was code named the &quot;Battle of Corangamite&quot;, and was conducted in the Victorian Western District, at the end of October.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1988, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the Japanese attack on the US fleet at [[Pearl Harbor]] and the British in [[Malayan campaign|Malaya]], on 9 December 1941 the battalion was ordered to &quot;prepare to move&quot; as it was mobilised for war service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/war_diaries/second_world_war/diary.asp?levelID=1012|title=AWM52-8-3-78: 39th Battalion, AMF, War Diary&amp;nbsp;– 9 December 1941|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of invasion by the Japanese changed the strategic situation and with it the planning forecasts of the Australian high command. As such, instead of relieving the 49th Battalion, the 39th was combined with the 49th and the New South Wales-based [[53rd Battalion (Australia)|53rd Battalion]] to form the [[30th Brigade (Australia)|30th Brigade]], and plans were made for the entire formation to deploy to New Guinea.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; Christmas Day 1941 was spent in camp, before the 39th Battalion was loaded onto two trains the following day for a rapid move north.&lt;ref name=&quot;39bnweb&quot;/&gt; One train went straight to [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]] and the other departed from [[Spencer Street Station]], Melbourne, two hours later. Both trains arrived in [[Sydney]] at 10:40 hours, on 27 December 1941. The battalion then detrained and moved by ferry to Woolloomooloo Wharf where the 1,068 officers, NCOs and men of the battalion boarded the passenger ship the [[RMS Aquitania|''Aquitania'']] bound for New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1988, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Kokoda Track campaign}}
[[File:Kokoda Track map.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A map of the Kokoda Track and it surrounding areas.|alt=A map depicting the Owen Stanley Ranges]]
Initially upon their arrival in New Guinea in January 1942 the 39th Battalion was used to defend the airfield at [[Jacksons International Airport|Seven Mile Aerodrome]] near Port Moresby and to carry out various other garrison tasks such as building defences and unloading stores at the wharf.&lt;ref name=39bnweb/&gt; In May 1942, the battalion's commanding officer, Conran, was deemed medically unfit for service and on 24 May he relinquished command.&lt;ref name=AWMconran /&gt; In June 1942, as the military situation in New Guinea deteriorated further, the battalion received orders to move up the [[Kokoda Track]] in order to act as a blocking force against the possibility of a Japanese advance overland from the north.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; In order to counter this threat, [[Maroubra Force]] composed of troops the 39th Battalion and the [[Papuan Infantry Battalion]] (PIB) were sent to Kokoda, arriving there on 15 July.&lt;ref name=Thompson321&gt;Thompson 2008, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; This move proved prescient as a large Japanese force landed at [[Gona]] only a week later, and they quickly began to move inland towards [[Kokoda]].&lt;ref name=Thompson321/&gt;

The first clash occurred at Awala on 23 July, when a platoon from 'B' Company, under the command of Captain Sam Templeton, having destroyed the footbridge over the [[Kumusi River]], engaged the Japanese on the far side of the river.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson322&gt;Thompson 2008, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians were forced to withdraw, however, when hundreds of Japanese marines began crossing the river under a barrage of mortar and machine gun fire.&lt;ref name=Thompson322/&gt; They withdrew only a few miles, before Templeton set up a successful ambush for the advancing Japanese on the banks of the Gorari Creek. Nevertheless, they were forced back further towards the high ground at Oivi where they attempted to make a stand while Templeton tried to make contact with battalion headquarters and the rest of the battalion who were spread out further along the track, in order to get more reinforcements.&lt;ref name=Thompson322/&gt;

On the evening of 29 July the Japanese attacked the main position Kokoda.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; There were only 80 men from 'B' Company left at that time, and armed only with small arms and a few [[Bren]] light machine guns, they were no match for the assaulting Japanese. Casualties on both sides were high as the Australians resorted to hand-to-hand combat, and the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, who had flown in to take over the battalion following Templeton's death, was killed while organising the withdrawal.&lt;ref name=Thompson323&gt;Thompson 2008, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; It became clear that Kokoda was lost and the following morning, under the cover of a dense mist, with the PIB's commanding officer, Major [[William Thornton Watson|William Watson]], assuming temporary command, the survivors abandoned the position and fell back towards the village of Deniki, a mile or so back along the Kokoda Track towards [[Battle of Isurava|Isurava]].&lt;ref name=Thompson323/&gt;

The remnants of 'B' Company regrouped at Deniki, but they were in a bad state and when on 4 August, Major Allan Cameron, brigade major of the 30th Brigade, arrived to take command of Maroubra Force, most of them were sent back to Isurava in disgrace as he was under the mistaken belief that they had run away from the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 2008, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, on 8 August the rest of the 39th Battalion, now without the only troops who had any experience fighting the Japanese, launched a counterattack at Kokoda.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; They managed to secure one side of the airfield, but due to the close proximity of the Japanese on the other side, relief aircraft were unable to land and short of food and ammunition, they were forced to fall back to Deniki once again after almost two days of fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 2008, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually managed to halt the Japanese advance and on 14 August Maroubra Force fell back to Isurava.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt;

At this point the fighting ceased for almost two weeks and during this time the 39th was joined by the 53rd and the 30th Brigade headquarters;&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; and Lieutenant Colonel [[Ralph Honner]] arrived from Ilolo to take command. Reaching the battalion at Isurava on 16 August, he subsequently began organising the battalion's defence of Isurava.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1988, pp. 123 &amp; 136&amp;ndash;140.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August Brigadier [[Arnold Potts]] took over command of Maroubra Force&lt;ref name=Thompson348&gt;Thompson 2008, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; and further reinforcements arrived as first the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th]], [[2/16th Battalion (Australia)|2/16th]] and later the [[2/27th Battalion (Australia)|2/27th]] Battalions from the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]]'s [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Brigade]] also reached the area.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; Despite this, the situation remained bleak as the supply issue was becoming a serious problem for the Australians and the reinforcements that had arrived were also in a state of disarray having been committed to the battle in a piecemeal fashion and suffering badly from hunger and disease.&lt;ref name=Thompson348/&gt;

Although the Japanese were experiencing similar problems in relation to supplies, they began their advance once again on 26 August and despite several rugged defensive actions the Australians were forced back again, first to [[Eora Creek]] on 30 August, then [[Battle of Eora Creek – Templeton's Crossing|Templeton's Crossing]] on 2 September, and finally to [[Battle of Mission Ridge – Brigade Hill|Efogi]] three days later.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; Exhausted from their efforts and no longer able to be considered an effective fighting force, the 39th was relieved and sent down the track to [[Koitaki]] to rest.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; They had done the job that was required of them, having stalled the Japanese advance in order to allow reinforcements to be brought up.&lt;ref&gt;Grey 2008, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paull 1958, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; These reinforcements came in the shape of the 25th Brigade, comprising the [[2/25th Battalion (Australia)|2/25th]], [[2/31st Battalion (Australia)|2/31st]] and [[2/33rd Battalion (Australia)|2/33rd Battalions]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 2008, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; Bitter fighting ensued around [[Battle of Ioribaiwa|Ioribaiwa]] and the Australians withdrew once again on 17 September, this time to Imita Ridge; however, the Japanese had reached their limit and on 24 September began to withdraw.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; The Australians subsequently launched a counter-offensive in October and by 2 November, Kokoda was back in Australian hands.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt;

====Fighting around Gona and disbandment====
{{Main|Battle of Buna&amp;ndash;Gona}}
Following the 39th Battalion's withdrawal from the line in September 1942, they spent a month at Koitaki before being sent back to Port Moresby in mid-October, where they were detailed to prepare defensive positions.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; In November, they were attached to the 21st Brigade, and throughout December the 39th Battalion was involved in further fighting as the brigade fought around Gona.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; During this time the 39th suffered heavy casualties, but the fighting continued and having captured the Gona Mission, the battalion moved to the Sanananda Track on 21 December, taking up a forward position at Huggins' Road Block.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; In the New Year the battalion was withdrawn to [[Soputa]] and returned to the 30th Brigade. They had suffered heavy casualties and in January 1943, when it was flown back to Port Moresby, it had a frontage of only seven officers and 25 men.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Austin236&gt;Austin 1988, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; In February, the 39th was ordered to prepare for operations in the [[Wau, Papua New Guinea|Wau]] area, in anticipation of a further Japanese attack, but this attack did not eventuate and on 12 March the 39th Battalion embarked for the return journey to Australia.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt;

Following the 39th Battalion's return to Australia, the men were given a period of leave before 30th Brigade was reconstituted on the [[Atherton Tablelands]] in Queensland. Initially, the plan was to reorganise the brigade and rebuild it prior to returning it to New Guinea,&lt;ref&gt;Cranston 1983, pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt; but in July it was decided that the 30th Brigade, along with its component battalions—the 39th, 49th, and [[3rd Battalion (Australia)|3rd Battalions]]—would be disbanded and used to reinforce the 6th Division,&lt;ref&gt;Dexter 1961, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; with reinforcements being sent to the [[16th Brigade (Australia)|16th]] and [[19th Brigade (Australia)|19th Brigades]].&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cranston 1983, pp. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt; This came into effect on 3 July 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/war_diaries/second_world_war/diary.asp?levelID=1012|title=AWM52-8-3-78: 39th Battalion, AMF, War Diary&amp;nbsp;– 3 July 1943|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result of this decision, the Militiamen that had been called up for service were transferred to the [[36th Battalion (Australia)|36th Battalion]], a Militia battalion from New South Wales, while those who had volunteered for overseas service{{#tag:ref|Within the meaning of the ''Defence Act (1903)'', overseas service was considered to be outside the immediate [[South-West Pacific Area]] and as the Militia could not be deployed outside this area, soldiers had to volunteer for the AIF to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2007, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} were sent to the [[2/2nd Battalion (Australia)|2/2nd Battalion]];&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Festberg97&gt;Festberg 1972, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; both of these units later saw further service in New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11954.asp |title=36th Battalion (St George's English Rifle Regiment) |work=Second World War, 1939–1945 units |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11253.asp |title=2/2nd Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939–1945 units |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the battalion's involvement in the fighting in New Guinea, 1,666 men had served in its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1988, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion suffered 403 combat casualties, which consisted of 118 killed in action, 13 died of wounds, five died other causes, and 266 wounded in action.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1988, pp. 251–255.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The Australian War Memorial lists slightly different figures of 388 casualties consisting of 135 killed or died and 253 wounded.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt;|group=Note}} Illness and disease also took a heavy toll and as a result, after six months of combat the 39th Battalion's muster roll was only seven officers and 25 other ranks.&lt;ref name=Austin236/&gt; For their service during World War II members of the 39th Battalion received the following decorations:&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; two MBEs, one DSO, four DCMs, seven MCs, 10 MMs, one US [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and 11 MIDs.&lt;ref name=AWM2/&gt; The 39th received eight battle honours for the war in 1961;&lt;ref name=Festberg97-98/&gt; it was the only Australian unit to receive the &quot;Kokoda Trail&quot; battle honour.&lt;ref name=Austin6&gt;Austin 1988, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Since the end of the war, the 39th Battalion's involvement in the fighting around Kokoda has become a significant part of the narrative surrounding the [[Anzac legend]] and Australia's emergence as a modern nation.&lt;ref name=Governor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governorgeneral.gov.au/php/speeches/htmlto.php?id=141 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918105947/http://www.governorgeneral.gov.au/php/speeches/htmlto.php?id=141 |archivedate=18 September 2006 |title= Address by Governor General&amp;nbsp;– On the occasion of the raising of the '39th Personnel Support Battalion'&amp;nbsp;– Shrine Of Remembrance, Melbourne&amp;nbsp;– 8 August 2006 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=6 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion's actions were first shown in [[Damien Parer]]'s 1942 film ''[[Kokoda Front Line]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/|title=Kokoda Front Line! |accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently in the 2006 Australian movie ''[[Kokoda (film)|Kokoda]]'', which was based partly on Victor Austin's ''To Kokoda and Beyond''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booksonwaraustralia.com/battalion-histories/232-kokoda-39th-battalion-9780522843798.html |title=39th To Kokoda and Beyond: The Story of the 39th Battalion |publisher=Books on War Australia |accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war when Australia's part-time military forces were reformed in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Grey 2008, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; while many battalions that had been disbanded during the war were re-raised, the 39th was not.&lt;ref name=regiments/&gt; On 8 August 2006, the Australian Army raised the [[39th (Personnel Support) Battalion]] (later re-designated the 39th Operational Support Battalion), adopting the 39th's numerical designation in order to perpetuate them on the order of battle. During the ceremony that was held at the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] in Melbourne, the Governor General, Major General [[Michael Jeffery]], described the 39th Battalion as some of &quot;Australia's most gallant soldiers&quot;, stating that the Australian nation was indebted to them for &quot;their heroic service&quot;.&lt;ref name=Governor/&gt;
