'''Matthew Linzee Sands''' (October 20, 1919 – September 13, 2014)  was an American [[physicist]] and educator best known as a co-author of the ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''. A graduate of [[Rice University]], Sands served with the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] and the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] during [[World War II]].

After the war, Sands studied cosmic rays for his doctorate at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) under the supervision of [[Bruno Rossi]]. Sands went to the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) in 1950, and helped build and operate its 1.5 GeV electron [[synchrotron]]. He became deputy director for the construction and early operation of the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] (SLAC) in 1963. Sands later joined the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UCSC) as a professor of physics, and served as its Vice Chancellor for Science from 1969 to 1972. In 1998, The [[American Physical Society]] awarded him the [[Robert R. Wilson]] Prize &quot;for his many contributions to [[accelerator physics]] and the development of electron-positron and proton colliders.&quot;&lt;ref name='EMERITUS'/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Matthew Linzee Sands was born in [[Oxford, Massachusetts]], on October 20, 1919. His parents were Linzee Sands and Beatrice Goyette, both of whom were bookkeepers. He had a brother, Roger, and a sister, Claire, who was seven years younger. As a 12-year-old [[Scout (Scouting)|Boy Scout]], Sands was motivated by his scoutmaster, who was a [[Amateur radio operator|radio amateur]], to build his own [[shortwave radio]] [[receiver (radio)|receiver]].  With the aid of information from the [[American Radio Relay League#Publications|Radio Amateur's Handbook]], he constructed it out of parts scavenged from old radios. He was encouraged to study [[mathematics]] and science by his high school math teacher, John Chafee, a graduate of [[Brown University]].&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt;

After high school, Sands entered [[Clark University]], where he studied [[physics]] and mathematics, and eventually received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) in 1940.  At Clark, his physics professors were Theodore P. Jorgensen,&lt;ref name='JORGENSON'/&gt; who became famous for his book &quot;The Physics of Golf&quot;, and Percy M. Roope,&lt;ref name='ROOPE'/&gt; who participated in the rocket experiments of [[Robert H. Goddard]].  As part of a job subsidized at 35 cents per hour by the [[National Youth Administration]], they assigned him to build physics equipment in the machine shops, where he became familiar with the [[Drill#Drill press|drill press]], [[Metal lathe|lathe]], and other [[Metalworking terminology#Metalworking tools|metalworking tools]].&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt;

Sand went on to receive his [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.) in physics from [[Rice University]].&lt;ref name='APS'/&gt; At Rice, Sands took graduate courses in [[Special relativity|relativity]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[thermodynamics]] from [[Harold A. Wilson (physicist)|Harold A. Wilson]], who was the first chair of the Rice physics department. He also completed experimental studies of [[ferromagnetism]]. At Rice, Sands met his first wife, Elizabeth, an [[undergraduate student]] there.&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt;

==World War II==
In 1941, Sands  went to the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he learned more about electronics under [[Joseph F. Keithley]].&lt;ref name='KEITHLY'/&gt; Keithly and Sands developed two [[influence mine]]s, from which three [[patent]]s were derived.&lt;ref name='PATENTS'/&gt; They performed sea tests of  a working prototype, but the program was stopped for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt;

By 1943, Sands had become impatient with the Navy's bureaucracy. After discussing the situation with Wilson, he appeared unannounced in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], at the office of [[Dorothy McKibbin]], who had been designated to meet newcomers to [[Los Alamos Laboratory]]. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had just received a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]]. To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the [[Manhattan Project]] after leaving Clark and going to [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|Nebraska]]. He immediately took Sands to the library to read [[Robert Serber]]'s [[Los Alamos Primer]], which introduced him to the basic physical principles of [[nuclear fission]] as they were known at the time, and their implications for [[nuclear weapon design]].&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt;

By this time, Sands had extensive experience with electronics and was immediately thrust into the electronics group, which was tasked with making instruments for the whole laboratory, and whose head was [[Darol Froman]]. Within this group, his close collaborators were [[William Elmore]],&lt;ref name='ELMORE'/&gt; [[William Higinbotham]], and [[Ernest Titterton]].  Anybody who had an instrumentation problem would come to the group for help. As a result, Sands worked with [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], [[Robert Bacher]], [[Hans Bethe]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Otto Frisch]], [[Bruno Rossi]], [[Emilio G. Segrè|Emilio Segrè]], [[Robert M. Walker (physicist)|Robert Walker]] and [[Robert R. Wilson|Robert Wilson]]; many of these famous physicists played important roles in his later career. In particular, he formed a close relationship with Rossi, with whom he later decided to work on his post-war Ph.D. degree.&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt; Rossi was most interested in the group's [[nuclear electronics]] equipment: pulse counters and amplifiers, discriminators, and [[Prescaler|scalers]].  In this area, Sands designed and patented a [[pulse height analyzer]],&lt;ref name='PHA'/&gt; and with [[Otto Frisch]] and Elmore, a [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulse]] amplifier.&lt;ref name='AMPLIFIER'/&gt;  He also created electronics for more general purposes, such as precise temperature regulation,&lt;ref name='REGULATOR'/&gt; and control of electroplating operations.&lt;ref name='ELECTROPLATING'/&gt;

In 1945, the Los Alamos Laboratory carried out the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] at a remote site near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]. Sands worked with Walker on a [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pressure measurement of the atmospheric [[shock wave]] produced by &quot;[[the gadget]]&quot;, a prototype of the [[Fat Man]] weapon later dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Their instrumentation worked well during a test explosion of 108 tons of TNT in May 1945, but no information was obtained during the Trinity test on July 16, 1945, because an unexpected rain shower the night before soaked the apparatus.&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt;

To raise public consciousness of issues raised by Trinity, [[David Hawkins (philosopher)|David Hawkins]], [[William Higinbotham]], [[Philip Morrison]], [[Robert R. Wilson|Robert Wilson]], Sands, and others formed the Los Alamos Association of Atomic Scientists. As a founding member, Sands put out its weekly newsletter. On November 30, 1945, this organization merged with similar groups within the Manhattan Project and at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] to form the Federation of Atomic Scientists, which soon changed its name to the [[Federation of American Scientists]] (FAS).&lt;ref name='BULLETIN'/&gt; 

In 1946, Sands and Elmore wrote &quot;Electronics: Experimental Techniques&quot;, which was published in 1949 by [[McGraw-Hill]].  This book presented many ideas and circuits developed at Los Alamos, and became a standard reference for post-war nuclear instrumentation.&lt;ref name='ELMORE-SANDS'/&gt;

==Massachusetts Institute of Technology==
After the success of the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Radiation Laboratory]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) moved into a new era of &quot;[[big science]]&quot; funded by the US government.&lt;ref name='MIT-HISTORY'/&gt; This era was predicted in a 1945 report, ''Science, The Endless Frontier'',&lt;ref name='FRONTIER'/&gt; written by [[Vannevar Bush]], who was an MIT graduate and influential head of the wartime [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]]. MIT's expansion into physics was encouraged by its president [[Karl Compton]] and by the head of the physics department, [[John C. Slater]]. The expansion of nuclear physics at MIT was spearheaded by [[Jerrold R. Zacharias]], who joined the Los Alamos Laboratory late in the war, and recruited [[Bruno Rossi]] and [[Victor Weisskopf]] as MIT professors.&lt;ref name='ZACHARIAS pp. 66-70'/&gt;

Within MIT's new [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Science#Laboratory for Nuclear Science|Laboratory for Nuclear Science]], headed by Zacharias, Rossi was assigned to create a [[cosmic ray]] research group. He recruited four young scientists who had been at Los Alamos, including Sands, and two who had been in the Radiation Laboratory, as Ph.D. candidates. All were more mature than typical graduate students, with several years of wartime research experience. They were paid a stipend similar to that of a [[postdoctoral research]]er, which enabled them to support families during their graduate studies. The laboratory was funded by the [[Office of Naval Research]].&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt;

With Rossi as his [[academic advisor]], and with the aid of a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] aircraft borrowed from the [[United States Air Force]], Sands carried out his thesis research on the slow [[muon]] component of [[cosmic ray]]s. He measured the intensity of low energy muons as a function of altitude up to {{convert|40000|ft}}, and derived their spectrum at production and as they propagated through the atmosphere.&lt;ref name='MESONS'/&gt; This information was important because most atmospheric cosmic rays are muons. Sands received his Ph.D. in physics from MIT in 1948, writing his thesis on &quot;The meson component of cosmic radiation&quot;.&lt;ref name='THESIS'/&gt; Sands then joined the faculty as an [[assistant professor]], and continued his cosmic ray research in Rossi's group.&lt;ref name='ASSISTANT'/&gt;

Another project of the Laboratory for Nuclear Science was a [[synchrotron]] [[particle accelerator]], which was designed to accelerate electrons to an energy of 350&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|MeV]]. The accelerator was funded by the Office of Naval Research and built under the supervision of [[Ivan A. Getting#Major technical and administrative contributions|Ivan A. Getting]], who was a professor of electrical engineering and had worked at the Radiation Laboratory on the extremely successful [[SCR-584 radar|SCR&amp;#8209;584 radar]]. Although its construction began in 1946, the accelerator had not begun to work by 1949. In response, Zacharias asked Sands to assist.&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt; This was Sands's introduction to [[accelerator physics]], and with his help the machine became operational early in 1950.&lt;ref name='SYNCHROTRON'/&gt;

In 1948, Sands divorced his first wife, Elizabeth, in [[Reno, Nevada]]. She remained in [[Weston, Massachusetts]], with their two children, while Sands married Eunice Hawthorne, a sister-in-law of his high school math teacher, John Chafee, and moved with her into MIT's Westgate housing units for married students.&lt;ref name='WESTGATE'/&gt;&lt;ref name='ADDRESS'/&gt; In early 1950, in his words:
{{quote|... my ex-wife had a father who had a fair amount of money, and they decided to make trouble for me, and were going to throw me in jail as a bigamist because they claimed my (Reno) divorce was not legal and so on. So I'm famous around MIT as the person who had to leave in the middle of the night and not come back.&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt; }}

==Later life==
[[File:The Feynman Lectures on Physics.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Feynman Lectures on Physics including Feynman's Tips on Physics: The Definitive and Extended Edition (2005)]]
Sands went to the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), where he helped build and operate a 1.5 GeV electron [[synchrotron]]. He was the first to demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, the role of quantum effects in electron [[particle accelerator]]s. He also studied beam instabilities, wake fields, beam-cavity interactions, and other phenomena.&lt;ref name='APS'/&gt;

In 1963, Sands became deputy director for the construction and early operation of the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] (SLAC). When Richard Feynman was deciding whether or not to accept the 1965 Nobel Prize—due to a disdain for the added notoriety it might bring—Sands convinced Feynman that not accepting it would bring even more attention.&lt;ref name='FEYNMAN'/&gt; Sands later joined the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UCSC) as a professor of physics, and served as its Vice Chancellor for science from 1969 to 1972.&lt;ref name='EMERITUS'/&gt;&lt;!-- Sands was an exacting professor, known to never provide answers to his difficult [[problem set]]s. --&gt; After retiring from UCSC in 1985, Sands worked as a consultant for SLAC and also as a consultant for Bay View Elementary School and Santa Cruz High School in [[Santa Cruz, California]], developing computer systems and physics lab activities for students.&lt;ref name='EMERITUS'/&gt;

From 1960 to 1966, Sands served on the Commission on College Physics, which carried out a national program to modernize physics instruction in the colleges and universities of the United States. He helped Feynman and [[Robert B. Leighton]] write the 1964 physics [[textbook]] ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', based upon the lectures given by Feynman to undergraduate students at Caltech between 1961 and 1963.&lt;ref name='ORAL'/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GLEICK&quot;/&gt; He was involved in the creation of [[Kresge College]], where he met Freya Kidner, a student there who subsequently became his third wife.&lt;ref name='OBIT'/&gt; He  received a Distinguished Service Award from the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]] in 1972, and in 1998 the [[American Physical Society]] awarded him the [[Robert R. Wilson]] Prize &quot;for his many contributions to [[accelerator physics]] and the development of electron-positron and proton colliders.&quot;&lt;ref name='EMERITUS'/&gt;

Sands died in Santa Cruz on September 13, 2014. He was survived by his wife Freya, his daughter, Michelle, sons Michael and Richard, and brother Roger.&lt;ref name='OBIT'/&gt;
