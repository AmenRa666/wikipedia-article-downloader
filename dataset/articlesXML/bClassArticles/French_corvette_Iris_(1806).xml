'''''Iris''''' was a 20-gun [[corvette]] of the [[French Navy]]. The [[Royal Navy]] captured her in 1809 and took her into service as HMS ''Rainbow''. She was sold in 1815.

==French service and capture==
''Iris'' was built to plan by Louis Bretocq, a plan that Jacques-Noël Sané altered. However, Bretocq probably acted as cosntructeur. Construction did not begin until some two years after the order, and ''Iris'' was then on the stocks for some three years.

The French Navy commissioned ''Iris'' on 31 December 1808, under ''capitaine de fregate'' Charles Méquet (or Joseph-Jean Macquet, or Miquet). She left Dunkirk 29 January 1809 with 640 casks of flour for Martinique.&lt;ref name=NC21/&gt; En route, on 2 February at 11am she encountered [[French ship Aimable (1781)|HMS ''Aimable'']], under Captain Lord George Stuart, while off the Texel on the Wellbank.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=13 February 1810|issue=16342|startpage=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 28-hour chase ensued, followed by a short running fight 38 [[league (unit)|leagues]] off Aberdeen. In the action ''Iris'' lost two men killed and eight wounded, and ''Aimable'' lost one man killed and one wounded. ''Iris'' then [[striking the colours|struck]].&lt;ref name=NC21&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 21, pp.171-2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iris'' was brought into Yarmouth [[Roadstead|roads]] in early February. ''Lloyd's List'' reported that she had been captured on 4 February, and that at the time of the encounter she had been in company with a brig.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no.4326,[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1809/02-10-1809.jpg] - accessed 16 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal Navy service==
''Iris'' arrived at Woolwich on 14 March 1809. There the Royal Navy took her into service as HMS ''Rainbow'' and proceeded to fit her out until 23 August. The British upgraded her armament, turning her into a 28-gun [[sixth rate]].&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; Commander James Woolridge commissioned her in August. He then sailed her for Jamaica on 24 November.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

On 13 March 1810, ''Rainbow'' encountered the French frigate [[HMS Madagascar (1811)|''Néréide'']], under the command of [[Jean-François Lemaresquier]], off Point [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]].&lt;ref name=James2/&gt; Though ''Néréide'' was almost twice the size of ''Rainbow'', Lemaresquier was uninterested in getting into an engagement. Next morning though, {{HMS|Avon|1805|2}}, under Commander Henry Fraser, joined the chase. Lemaresqueir continued to flee to separate the two British ships, but stopped to engage ''Rainbow'' after ''Avon'' had fallen back. He soon had reduced ''Rainbow'' to a battered state, but ''Avon'' resolutely came in support and put a 30-minute fight against the much stronger ''Néréide'' before herself retreating. ''Rainbow'' suffered ten men wounded; ''Avon'' had one man killed, one mortally wounded, and seven wounded.&lt;ref name=James2/&gt; The French account is that damage on ''Néréide'' prevented her from giving chase. Lemaresquier therefore continued on his course, reaching Brest on 30 March.&lt;ref&gt;Troude (1867), vol. 4, pp.99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; The British account is that ''Néréide'' declined to continue the action, despite the damaged state of the two British ships, and instead sailed on. The two British ships then made for Jamaica as best they could, arriving on the 16th.&lt;ref name=James2&gt;James (1837), pp. 227–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rainbow'' returned to Britain, before sailing for the Mediterranean on 12 May 1811.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; Captain Gardiner Guion assumed command on 26 September 1811. He sailed ''Rainbow'' in support of the Catalonian patriots, against the French.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, p.446.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812 Captain Andrew King took command.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

Captain Gawen Hamilton took command in 1813. On 8 April 1813 he was already in command when ''Rainbow'' captured the French brig ''Paix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17065|startpage=1979|date=26 September 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July ''Rainbow'', in company with the lugger ''Thistle'', recaptured the ''Perseverance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17099|startpage=71|date=13 January 1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|It is not entirely clear what vessel ''Thistle'' was as no ship of her description is listed as a commissioned warship or [[hired armed vessels|hired armed vessel]]. The prize money report gives her commander as Lieutenant James Anderson and she may have been a tender to a warship. The most likely candidate is the lugger ''Thistle'', of 10 guns and 50 men, that was a tender to {{HMS|Caledonia|1808|2}}, then serving in the Mediterranean as Sir [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Edward Pellew's]] flagship.&lt;ref&gt;O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; A first-class share of the prize money was worth [[£sd|£]]579 17[[shilling|s]] 8½[[pence|d]], or some two-years salary for Hamilton. A sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth £7 3s 11½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17101|startpage=116|date=20 January 1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

''Rainbow'' and {{HMS|Pylades|1794|2}} were in company on 18 June searching for a &quot;remarkably fast-sailing brigantine&quot;, of one gun and 40 men. During the night they found her and were able to come up on either side of her. They then forced her on shore under Cape Cavallo, Sardinia ({{coord|40|48|N|9|50|E}}; probably Capo Coda Cavallo).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16787|startpage=2032|date=12 October 1813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September, ''Rainbow{{'}}''s boats captured two [[Lateen|latines]] off the Bay of [[Ajaccio]]. One had on board a lieutenant and several men of the 2d Battalion of French [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]]. The other was carrying a cargo of wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16843|startpage=124|date=11 January 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, on 13 December, Hamilton went onshore to assist the Italian levies in their unsuccessful attack on [[Livorno|Leghorn]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp.448–9.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a force of marines from a squadron of eight British warships, including ''Rainbow''. During this operation Hamilton was lightly wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, pp.427–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1814 ''Rainbow'' supported the British Army in its successful attack on Genoa, losing one man severely wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16896|startpage=977|endpage=980|date=9 May 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the fall of Genoa, the boats of {{HMS|Berwick|1809|2}} and ''Rainbow'', together with two Sicilian gunboats, attacked French posts near the pass of Rona on 8 and 10 April to assist the British Army in its advance. The British drove off the French defenders, who left behind two 24-pounder guns and two mortars. The British lost two men killed and five wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16897|startpage=984|date=10 May 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prize money for Genoa was paid in 1818.{{#tag:ref|The Admiral's share was worth £887 19s 0½d. A first-class share was worth £169 2s 8d; a sixth-class share was worth £1 2s 8¼d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17361|startpage=912|date=19 May 1818}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another payment for the vessels in Admiral [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Pellew's]] squadron on 19 April was paid two years later. A first-class share was worth £69 6s 1d; a sixth-class share was worth 9s 4d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17652|startpage=2153|date=18 November 1820}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Next, ''Rainbow'' was part of the naval force in the British capture of Savona on 24 April.{{#tag:ref|A first-class share was worth £71 10s 8½d; a sixth-class share was worth 9s 5½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17322|startpage=109|date=31 January 1818}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Captain Edward Silby replaced Hamilton in 1814, only to be replaced by Captain James Black, who in turn was replaced by James Wemyss in July.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==Fate==
''Rainbow'' was paid off in December 1814. The Navy offered her for sale at Deptford on 23 March 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16993|startpage=484|date=14 March 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold her on 25 March for £860.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;
