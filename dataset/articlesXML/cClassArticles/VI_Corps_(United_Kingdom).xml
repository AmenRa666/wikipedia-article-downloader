'''VI Corps''' was an [[army corps]] of the [[British Army]] in World War I. It was first organised in June 1915 and fought throughout on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

==Prior to World War I==
In 1876 a Mobilisation Scheme for the forces in Great Britain and Ireland, including eight army corps of the 'Active Army', was published. The '6th Corps' was headquartered at [[Chester]], composed primarily of militia, and in 1880 comprised:

*1st Division (Chester)
**1st Brigade (Chester)
***Denbigh Militia (Wrexham), 1st Cheshire Militia (Chester), Montgomery Militia (Welchpool)
**2nd Brigade (Chester)
***Clare Militia (Enniskillen), Flint Militia (Mold), Carnarvon Militia (Carnarvon)
**Divisional Troops
***Cheshire Yeomanry (Chester)
*2nd Division (Liverpool)
**1st Brigade (Liverpool)
***Dublin City Militia (Dublin), 2nd Lancashire Militia (Liverpool),Roscommon Militia (Boyle)
**2nd Brigade (Liverpool)
***1st Stafford Militia (Lichfield), 2nd Stafford Militia (Stafford), 3rd Stafford Militia (Newcastle-under-Lyme)
**Divisional Troops
***2nd Bn. 20th Foot (Mullingar), Lancashire Hussars (Ashton in Makerfield)
*3rd Division (Manchester)
**1st Brigade (Manchester)
***1st Derby Militia (Derby), 2nd Derby Militia (Chesterfield), 2nd Cheshire Militia (Macclesfield)
**2nd Brigade (Preston)
***1st Lancashire Militia (Lancaster), 3rd Lancashire Militia (Preston), 4th Lancashire Militia (Warrington)
**Divisional Troops
***1st Bn. 11th Foot (Manchester), Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry (Worsley)
*Cavalry Brigade (Crewe)
**Denbighshire Yeomanry (Ruthin), Derbyshire Yeomanry (Derby), Worcestershire Yeomanry (Worcester)

This scheme had been dropped by 1881.&lt;ref&gt;''Army List'' 1876–1881.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1901 Army Estimates (introduced by [[William St John Fremantle Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|St John Brodrick]] when [[Secretary of State for War]]) allowed for six army corps based on the six regional commands: 'Sixth Army Corps' was to be formed by [[Scottish Command]] with headquarters in [[Edinburgh]]. It was to comprise 3 regiments of [[Imperial Yeomanry]], 26 artillery batteries (17 Regular, 6 [[Militia#Nineteenth century|Militia]] and 3 [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]]) and 25 infantry battalions (2 Regular, 13 Militia and 10 Volunteers). Under Army Order No 38 of 1907 the corps titles disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==

===Operations around Ypres===
VI Corps was organised within [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Sir Herbert Plumer]]'s [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] on 1 June 1915. It was placed under the command of Lt-Gen Sir [[John Keir|John Lindesay Keir]], promoted from command of [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Division]]. Initially it comprised [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]] from [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] and [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Division]] from [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]], and it took over the left of the British line at [[Ypres]].&lt;ref&gt;''Official History 1915'' Vol II, p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who Was Who 1929-40''.&lt;/ref&gt;

VI Corps cooperated with the attack by its neighbour V Corps on Bellewaarde Ridge on 16 June 1915 with rifle and artillery fire, and in July and August 1915 it was engaged in trench fighting round [[Hooge Crater Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery|Hooge Chateau]].&lt;ref&gt;''Official History 1915'' Vol II, pp 99, 102-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The corps was first seriously engaged in the Second Battle of Bellewaarde, a subsidiary attack to assist [[British First Army|First Army]]'s attack at [[Battle of Loos|Loos]] on 18 September 1915.&lt;ref name=corps/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Official History 1915'' Vol II, p 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phosgene attack===
Before dawn on 19 December 1915 VI Corps was the victim of the first German attack with [[Chemical weapons in World War I|phosgene gas]]. It had [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Division]] and [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division|49th Division]] holding the line and [[14th (Light) Division]] in reserve. The attack was made by the German [[XXVI Reserve Corps (German Empire)|XXVI Reserve Corps]] between the Roulers and Staden railways, NW of Ypres. The attack was designed to test new weapons (the gas released was an 80:20 mixture of chlorine and phosgene) and to inflict casualties. There was some shelling, but apart from sending out infantry and air patrols to gauge the effectiveness of the gas cloud, the Germans made no attempt to advance. VI Corps' anti-gas measures were reasonably effective, and a pre-arranged counter-barrage of shrapnel shells discouraged the enemy patrols. The British reserves stood to, but were not required. A total of 1069 gas casualties (120 fatal) were suffered, three-quarters by 49th Division.&lt;ref&gt;''Official History 1916'', Vol I, pp 158-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1916===
In early 1916 the expanding BEF was reorganised, and VI Corps became part of [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Sir Edmund Allenby]]'s [[British Third Army|Third Army]] in the [[Arras]] sector, with which it remained until the Armistice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vol I p 39&quot;&gt;''Official History 1916'', Vol I, p 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[5th Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]]
*[[14th (Light) Division]]
*[[56th (London) Infantry Division|56th (1/1st London) Division)]]

Later in the year, VI Corps was taken over by Lt-Gen J.A.L. (later [[Aylmer Haldane|Sir Aylmer) Haldane]], promoted from command of [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]], who remained in command until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Official History 1916'' Vol II, p 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arras Offensive===
In the Spring of 1917 VI Corps took part in Third Army's [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]]. During the phase known as the [[Battle of Arras (1917)#First Battle of the Scarpe .289.E2.80.9314 April 1917.29|First Battle of the Scarpe]] (9–14 April), [[37th Division (United Kingdom)|37th Division]] of VI Corps captured [[Monchy-le-Preux]]. During the [[Battle of Arras (1917)#Second Battle of the Scarpe .2823.E2.80.9324 April 1917.29|Second Battle of the Scarpe]] (23–24 April), [[15th (Scottish) Infantry Division|15th (Scottish) Division]] captured [[Guémappe|Guemappe]].&lt;ref name=arras&gt;[http://www.1914-1918.net/bat18.htm The Arras Offensive]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Battle of Arras (1917)#Battle of Arleux .2828.E2.80.9329 April 1917.29|Battle of Arleux]] (28–29 April) VI Corps only had 3rd and 12th (Eastern) Divisions in the line, but [[56th (London) Infantry Division|56th (1/1st London) Division]] was added for the [[Third Battle of the Scarpe#Third Battle of the Scarpe .283.E2.80.934 May 1917.29|Third Battle of the Scarpe]] (3–4 May). 3rd and 12th Eastern) Divisions took [[Rœux|Roeux]] (13–14 May), which brought it up to the [[Drocourt-Quéant|Drocourt-Queant Switch Line]] (part of the [[Hindenburg Line]] defences) and completed VI Corps' participation in the offensive.&lt;ref name=arras/&gt;

===The German counter-offensive===
VI Corps fought in the [[Operation Michael#The Battle of St.-Quentin .2821 .E2.80.93 23 March 1918.29|Battle of St Quentin]] (21–23 March), and the [[Operation Michael#Actions of the Somme crossings and the First Battle of Bapaume .2824 .E2.80.93 25 March 1918.29|First Battle of Bapaume]] (24–25 March), the opening phases  of the German 1918 Spring Offensive ([[Operation Michael]]), otherwise known as the 'First Battles of the Somme 1918'.&lt;ref name=somme&gt;[http://www.1914-1918.net/bat22.htm The First Battles of the Somme 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[59th (2nd North Midland) Division]]
*[[42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division|42nd (East Lancashire) Division]] - replaced 34th Division at Bapaume.

By the end of the month, VI Corps was back where it had been a year earlier, fighting a new [[Operation Michael#The First Battle of Arras .2828 March 1918.29|Battle of Arras]] on 28 March. For this action Haldane had  [[2nd Canadian Division]] and 97th Brigade of [[32nd Division (United Kingdom)|32nd Division]] under command, as well as Guards, 3rd and 31st Divisions. 32nd Division took part in the [[Battle of the Ancre (1918)|Battle of the Ancre]] on 5 April.&lt;ref name=somme/&gt;

===The Hundred Days===
During the [[Second Battle of the Somme|Second Battles of the Somme]] in August 1918, VI Corps attacked at Albert (21–23 August).&lt;ref name=second&gt;[http://www.1914-1918.net/bat27.htm The Second Battles of the Somme 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Order of Battle of VI Corps August 1918'''&lt;ref name=second/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[General Officer Commanding|GOC]]: Lt-Gen [[James Aylmer Lowthorpe Haldane|Sir Aylmer Haldane]]
*[[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]]

*[[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]
*[[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division|52nd (Lowland) Division]]
*[[56th (London) Infantry Division|56th (1/1st London) Division]]
*[[59th (2nd North Midland) Division]]

For the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]] (31 August-3 September) and the subsequent Allied attacks during September 1918, VI Corps had Guards, 2nd, 3rd, and [[62nd (2nd West Riding) Division|62nd (2nd West Riding)]] Divisions under command.&lt;ref name=second/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Official History 1918'', Vol V, Appendix I.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Final Advance in Picardy, VI Corps fought in the [[Battle of the Selle]] (17–25 October) and the [[Battle of the Sambre (1918)|Battle of the Sambre]] (4 November).&lt;ref&gt;''Official history 1918'', Vol V.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1914-1918.net/bat33.htm The final advance in Picardy]&lt;/ref&gt;

German resistance was now crumbling, and the Allied advance had become a pursuit. During the night of 8/9 November, the reserve of Guards Division,  3rd Battalion [[Grenadier Guards]], was pushed ahead through a black night with its machine guns on pack mules to seize the citadel of the old French frontier fortress of [[Maubeuge]], which the Germans had captured after a siege in 1914. The main German defence line was now seven miles away. By 11 November when the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]] came into effect, the 62nd and Guards Divisions were the advance guard of Third Army, but were doing no more than pushing forward infantry outposts and cyclist patrols against the dissolving German forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Official history 1918'', Vol V, pp 529, 553.&lt;/ref&gt; VI Corps was among Allied troops that advanced into the [[Rhineland#Following World War I|Rhineland]] after the Armistice.&lt;ref&gt;Tweed p 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Officers Commanding==
Commanders have been:
* Jun 1915-Aug 1916 Lieutenant General [[John Keir]]&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: Lieutenant General Sir John Keir, The Times, 4 May 1937, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aug 1916-1919 Lieutenant General [[Aylmer Haldane]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/HALDANE.shtml Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
In July 1918 the sculptor [[John Tweed]], who had failed to gain employment as an official war artist, was commissioned by General [[Jan Smuts]] to travel to France and prepare designs for a proposed South African War Memorial. Tweed knew Haldane, who had raised the money for Tweed's sculpture of [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Lt-Gen Sir John Moore]] at [[Shorncliffe, Kent|Shorncliffe]], and Haldane offered the sculptor facilities with VI Corps HQ. Tweed spent the last five months of the war as a civilian member of the corps staff, and accompanied the troops into the Rhineland. Although one of Tweed's studies entitled ''Attack'' was exhibited, the ambitious architectural monument that he designed for South Africa was never executed.&lt;ref&gt;Tweed pp 172-4.&lt;/ref&gt;
