The '''''U-10'' class''' was a [[ship class|class]] of five [[submarine]]s or [[U-boats]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine ''or'' K.u.K. Kriegsmarine}}) during [[World War I]]. The class was similar to the [[German Type UB I submarine]] of the [[German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}); the first two boats delivered to [[Austria-Hungary]] had previously been [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in Kaiserliche Marine.

The ''U-10'' class as a whole did not have much wartime success, with three of the boats sinking either one or no ships. Only one boat, {{SMU|U-15|Austria-Hungary|2}} sank more than {{GRT|1,000|disp=long}} of enemy ships. Of the five submarines of the class, only {{SMU|U-16|Austria-Hungary|2}} was sunk during the war; the remaining four were delivered as [[war reparations]] and broken up by 1920.

== Background ==
The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]'s U-boat fleet at the beginning of [[World War I]] consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were not operational.&lt;ref name=Con-341&gt;Gardiner, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;{{SMU|U-1|Austria-Hungary|2}} and {{SMU|U-2|Austria-Hungary|2}} were in drydock awaiting [[diesel engine]]s to replace their inadequate [[gasoline engine]]s. See: Gardiner, pp. 340–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy did have five {{sclass|U-7|submarine|1}}s under construction in Germany, but a perceived inability to sail the completed submarines past [[Gibraltar]] to [[Pula|Pola]] led to a hasty decision to sell them to Germany,&lt;ref name=Con-341 /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In April 1915, some five months after the sale of the ''U-7'' boats, the German U-boat {{SMU|U-21|Germany|2}} successfully sailed into the [[Mediterranean]] via [[Gibraltar]], proving that delivery of the ''U-7'' boats to Austria-Hungary would have been possible. See: Gardiner, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; a severe setback for Austria-Hungary's [[List of Austro-Hungarian U-boats|U-boat fleet]].&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt;

In order to bolster their fleet, which had already been boosted by the recovery and [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] of the French submarine [[French submarine Curie (Q 87)|''Curie'']] as ''U-14'' in 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased five German UB-type coastal submarines, which had the advantages of short construction time and the ability to be shipped by rail—which avoided the perceived pitfalls of sea delivery.&lt;ref name=Con-341 /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The performance of the German [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] U-boats was well known in Austria because the [[Imperial German Navy]] submarines {{SMU|UB-3||2}}, {{SMU|UB-8||2}}, and {{SMU|UB-9||2}} had been shipped from Germany and assembled and launched at [[Pula|Pola]]. See Gardiner, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; The first contract in February 1915 secured the purchase of {{SMU|U-10|Austria-Hungary|2}} and {{SMU|U-11|Austria-Hungary|2}}, initially commissioned as the German [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] U-boats [[SM UB-1|''UB-1'']] and [[SM UB-15|''UB-15'']], respectively.&lt;ref name=Con-341 /&gt; A further contract on 1 April 1915, purchased three more boats, {{SMU|U-15|Austria-Hungary|2}}, {{SMU|U-16|Austria-Hungary|2}}, and {{SMU|U-17|Austria-Hungary|2}}.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt;

== Design and construction ==
The ''U-10''-class boats were small coastal submarines that displaced {{convert|125.5|LT|t}} surfaced and {{convert|140.25|LT|t}} submerged. For propulsion, they featured a single shaft, a single {{convert|60|bhp|abbr=on}} [[diesel engine]] for surface running, and a single {{convert|120|shp|abbr=on}} electric motor for submerged travel.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; The boats were capable of {{convert|6.5|to|7.5|kn}} while surfaced and {{convert|5.5|to|6.2|kn}} while submerged at a diving depth of up to {{convert|50|m|ft}}. All five had slightly different [[conning tower]] configurations, but were all designed for a crew of 17 officers and men.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt;

The [[lead ship|lead boat]] of the class, ''U-10'', was built by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] of [[Kiel]], while the other four were constructed by [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen]]. All five were transported by rail in sections to [[Pula|Pola]], where they only needed riveting together to be complete,&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; a process that typically took about two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Messimer, p. 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

''U-10'' was the first ship of the class [[ship naming and launching|launched]], as the German ''UB-1'' on 22 January 1915. The other four boats were launched by April.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; ''UB-1'' and ''UB-15'' were initially commissioned into the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' in January and April, respectively,&lt;ref name=UB-1&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = WWI U-boats: UB-1 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=UB+1 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date = | accessdate = 3 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UB-15&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = WWI U-boats: UB-15 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=UB+U15 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date = | accessdate = 3 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; each with German commanders and crew, but with an Austro-Hungarian Navy officer for piloting and training purposes,&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; but both were commissioned into the ''[[Austro-Hungarian Navy|K.u.K. Kriegsmarine]]'' with Austro-Hungarian crews by July.&lt;ref name=UB-1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=UB-15 /&gt; The other three ships were never manned by German crews and had all been commissioned by early October when each is listed in sources with a commanding officer.&lt;ref name=KUK-U-15&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = WWI U-boats: U KUK U15 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=KUK+U15 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date = | accessdate = 3 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KUK-U-16&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = WWI U-boats: U KUK U16 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=KUK+U16 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date = | accessdate = 3 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KUK-U-17&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = WWI U-boats: U KUK U17 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=KUK+U17 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date = | accessdate = 3 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Armament ==
The ''U-10'' class boats were equipped with two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; The German Type UB I submarines were additionally equipped with a {{convert|8|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]], but it is not clear from sources if ''U-10'' and ''U-11'', the former German boats, were either equipped with them or, if so, retained them in Austro-Hungarian service. In October 1916, all the boats except ''U-11'' received 37&amp;nbsp;mm/23 (1.5&amp;nbsp;in) [[Quick-firing gun|quick-firing]] (QF) guns. ''U-11'' received a 66&amp;nbsp;mm/18 (2.6&amp;nbsp;in) gun originally planned for [[SM U-14 (Austria-Hungary)|''U-14'']] (which received a larger gun instead). In November 1917, the 37&amp;nbsp;mm guns were replaced by 47&amp;nbsp;mm/23 (1.9&amp;nbsp;in) QF guns.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt;

== War activities ==
All five boats of the ''U-10'' class took part in the war, but, as a class, had limited success.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; Although ''UB-1'' and ''UB-15'' had each had sunk a single ship while commissioned in the German Imperial Navy during 1915,&lt;ref name=UB-1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=UB-15 /&gt; neither boat sank any ships in Austro-Hungarian service.&lt;ref name=KUK-U-10&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = WWI U-boats: U KUK U10 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=KUK+U10 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date = | accessdate = 3 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KUK-U-11&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = WWI U-boats: U KUK U11 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=KUK+U11 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date = | accessdate = 3 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-17'' torpedoed a single ship, the Italian [[destroyer]] [[Italian destroyer Impetuoso|''Impetuoso'']], which sank on 10 July 1916.&lt;ref name=Impetuoso&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Impetuoso | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/2995.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date = | accessdate = 3 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-16'' sank two small sailing ships in late 1915 and torpedoed and sank the Italian destroyer [[Italian destroyer Nembo|''Nembo'']] on 16 October 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Nembo | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/4341.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date = | accessdate = 3 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-15'' was the most successful of the class, sinking six ships for a total of {{GRT|8,789}}.&lt;ref name=KUK-U-15 /&gt; On a single day, 25 June 1916, ''U-15'' sank the Italian [[auxiliary cruiser]] {{SS|Citta di Messina||2}} and the French destroyer [[French destroyer Fourche|''Fourche'']] in the [[Strait of Otranto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Derencin | first = Robert | title = The Central Powers submarines in the Mediterranean during WWI | url = http://www.uboat.net/articles/index.html?article=64 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date = | accessdate = 3 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; accounting for almost half of her wartime successes.

Of the five boats, only ''U-16'' was sunk during the war, shortly after sinking ''Nembo''.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; The only other casualty among the class involved ''U-10'', which hit a [[naval mine|mine]] near [[Caorle]] and was beached with heavy damage. Although she was looted by [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] troops, she was later towed to [[Trieste]] for repairs which remained incomplete at the war's end. After the end of fighting in November 1918, the four surviving class members—''U-10'', ''U-11'', ''U-15'', and ''U-17''—were all turned over to Italy as [[war reparations]] and scrapped at Pola by 1920.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt;

== Class members ==

=== SM ''U-10'' ===
{{main|SM U-10 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-10'' was the [[lead ship|lead boat]] of the ''U-10'' class of submarines for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but was originally named ''UB-1'' as a part of the German Imperial Navy. She was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 1 November 1914 in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 22 January 1915. Commissioned one week later as SM ''UB-1'', she sank one Italian [[torpedo boat]] in her German service. In July, she was handed over to the Austro-Hungarian Navy and commissioned as SM ''U-10''. She was the target of an unsuccessful torpedo attack by a British submarine in May 1917. In July 1918, ''U-10'' hit a [[naval mine|mine]] and was beached with heavy damage. She was towed to [[Trieste]] for repairs which remained unfinished at the war's end. She was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.

=== SM ''U-11'' ===
{{main|SM U-11 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-11'' was also originally a part of the German Imperial Navy, under the name ''UB-15''. She was laid down on 9 November 1914 in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled, launched, and commissioned as SM ''UB-15'' on 11 April 1915. In her only wartime success, she sank an Italian submarine in German service in early June. Shortly thereafter, she was delivered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy and commissioned as SM ''U-11'' on 14 June. In early 1916, ''U-11'' made a torpedo attack on a British submarine but missed. She was delivered to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.

=== SM ''U-15'' ===
{{main|SM U-15 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-15'' was constructed in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched in September 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. ''U-15'' was the most successful boat of the ''U-10'' class, sinking six ships totaling more than {{GRT|8,000}}. She survived the war and was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.

=== SM ''U-16'' ===
{{main|SM U-16 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-16'' was constructed in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 26 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. ''U-16'' sank one ship in November 1915 and seized another in December. While operating in the Adriatic off the coast of [[Albania]] in mid-October 1916, ''U-16'' sank an Italian [[destroyer]] acting as a convoy escort. ''U-16'' was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources are not clear on the exact cause of her sinking.

=== SM ''U-17'' ===
{{main|SM U-17 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-17'' was constructed in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 21 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. ''U-17'' sank an Italian [[destroyer]] in July 1916 as part of an effort to disrupt the [[Otranto Barrage]] but sank no other ships during the war. The boat survived the war and was delivered to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.
