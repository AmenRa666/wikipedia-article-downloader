== Comments on fleeing ships==
Four ships from Creutz' and Uggla's squadron immediately fled when they saw that the flagship was lost.

Presume author means 'fleet' rather than 'squadron'.....or does he/she? Could mean 4 each from their two separate squadrons.....
I don't know! In any case, 4 (or 8?) seems almost too precise......is it from the comission's report? Well, I went ahead and changed it to:

Several ships immediately fled when they saw that the flagship was lost.

:Thank you very much for the copyedit, Tomseattle. It did much to improve some of my iffier sentences. :-)
:As for the number of ships, I was quoting an exact figure, so I reverted that particular edit. As far as I recall, Zettersten listed the names of the ships, but I felt that was too detailed for the article. Zettersten based his work primarily on navy archives, so he's considered quite reliable when it comes to details like that. And when you think about it, four ships represents a lot of men and firepower, so it's really not that much different than saying that a certain number of companies or battalions in a land battle fled the scene.

== Reference callout consistency ==

* Some of the short-form (and other &quot;non-sentence&quot;) reference callouts are terminated with a full stop (e.g. Glete (1993), pp. 173–178.) and others (including at least one sentence, &quot;Denmark and Sweden still used the Julian calendar; the Dutch Republic had switched to the Gregorian in 1582–83&quot; are not. I don't really mind which way this is done (although I clearly preferred the full stops for everything) but please make sure that the article is consistent.
* &quot;Sjöblom (2003), pp. 225–226;&quot; is terminated with a semicolon which is incorrect either way round.
Thanks for correcting these points, which ever way you prefer. --[[User:Mirokado|Mirokado]] ([[User talk:Mirokado|talk]]) 01:15, 13 October 2014 (UTC)
:D'oh. Thanks for pointing that out. I really only use punctuation for actual sentences in notes (as far as I know). And I never use separate commentary notes, so I have no ambitions to employ absolute period/no period consistency.
