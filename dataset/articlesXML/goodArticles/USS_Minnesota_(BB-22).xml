'''USS ''Minnesota'' (BB-22)''', the fifth of six {{sclass-|Connecticut|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s, was the first ship of the [[United States Navy]] in honor of [[Minnesota|the 32nd state]]. She was laid down at the [[Newport News Shipbuilding Company]] of [[Newport News, Virginia]] in October 1903, launched in April 1905, and commissioned into the US fleet in March 1907, just four months after the revolutionary British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} entered service. ''Minnesota'' was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|12|in|adj=on}} guns and a secondary battery of twenty 7 and 8&amp;nbsp;in (178 and 203&amp;nbsp;mm) guns, unlike ''Dreadnought'', which carried an [[dreadnought|all-big-gun]] armament that rendered ships like ''Minnesota'' obsolescent.

Shortly after she entered service, ''Minnesota'' joined the [[Great White Fleet]] for its circumnavigation of the globe in 1908&amp;ndash;09. The years from 1909 to 1912 were uneventful, but thereafter the ship began to become involved in conflicts in the Caribbean. She supported efforts to put down an insurrection in [[Cuba]] in 1912 and patrolled the coast of Mexico in 1913&amp;ndash;14 during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In 1916, the ship was placed in reserve, though she quickly returned to service when the United States entered [[World War I]] in April 1917. During the war, she trained naval personnel; while cruising off the eastern coast of the United States in September 1918, she struck a [[naval mine]] laid by a German [[U-boat]]. The extensive damage required lengthy repairs that kept her out of service for the rest of the war. She helped to return American soldiers from Europe in 1919 before resuming her [[training ship]] duties in 1920&amp;ndash;21, before being decommissioned in December 1921 and broken up for scrap at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] in 1924.

==Design==
[[File:Connecticut-class battleship line-drawing.png|thumb|left|Line-drawing of the ''Connecticut'' class]]
{{main|Connecticut-class battleship}}

''Minnesota'' was {{convert|456.3|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|76.9|ft|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{convert|24.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}. She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|16000|LT}} as designed and up to {{convert|17666|LT}} at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft [[triple-expansion engine|triple-expansion]] [[steam engine]]s rated at {{convert|16500|ihp|lk=in}} and twelve coal-fired [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] [[boiler]]s, generating a top speed of {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}}. As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by [[lattice mast]]s in 1909. She had a crew of 827&amp;nbsp;officers and men, though this increased to 881 and later to 896.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=144}}

The ship was armed with a [[main battery]] of four [[12&quot;/45 caliber Mark 5 gun|12&amp;nbsp;inch /45 Mark 5]]{{efn|/45 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]]. A /45 gun is 45 times long as it is in bore diameter.}} guns in two twin [[gun turret]]s on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight [[8&quot;/45 caliber gun|{{convert|8|inch|adj=on|0}} /45 guns]] and twelve [[7&quot;/44 caliber gun|{{convert|7|in|adj=on|0}} /45 guns]]. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets [[amidships]] and the 7-inch guns were placed in [[casemates]] in the hull. For close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, she carried twenty [[3″/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}} /50]] guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. She also carried four {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} 1-pounder guns. As was standard for [[capital ship]]s of the period, ''Minnesota'' carried four {{convert|21|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, submerged in her hull on the broadside.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=144}} 

''Minnesota''{{'}}s main [[armored belt]] was {{convert|11|in|abbr=on|0}} thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and {{convert|6|in|abbr=on|0}} elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had {{convert|12|in|adj=on}} thick faces, and the supporting [[barbette]]s had the {{convert|10|in|abbr=on}} of armor plating. The secondary turrets had {{convert|7|in|abbr=on}} of frontal armor. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|9|in|abbr=on}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=144}}

==Service history==
[[File:Minnesota (BB22). Port bow, other ships in background, 06-12-1907 - NARA - 512932.jpg|thumb|left|''Minnesota'' in June 1907]]

The [[keel]] for ''Minnesota'' was laid down at the [[Newport News Shipbuilding Company]] of [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 27 October 1903. The completed hull was launched on 8 April 1905; at the launching ceremony she was christened by Rose Marie Schaller, the daughter of a member of the [[Minnesota Senate]]. The ship was commissioned into the US Navy on 9 March 1907, with [[Captain (USN)|Captain]] [[John Hubbard (admiral)|John Hubbard]] as her first commanding officer. The ship then conducted a [[shakedown cruise]] off the coast of [[New England]] before attending the [[Jamestown Exposition]], the commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] colony, the first permanent English settlement in the Americas. She was present at the ceremony from 22 April to 3 September.{{sfn|DANFS Minnesota}}

On 16 December, ''Minnesota'' steamed out of [[Hampton Roads]] with the [[Great White Fleet]] for a circumnavigation of the globe. The cruise was intended as a show of force to Japan, the United States' rival in the Pacific, to assert the United States' status as a global naval power, and to convince [[United States Congress|Congress]] of the need to support increased naval expenditures.{{sfn|DANFS Minnesota}} The fleet cruised south to the [[Caribbean]] and then to South America, making stops in [[Port of Spain]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Punta Arenas]], and [[Valparaíso]], among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice.{{sfn|Albertson|pp=41&amp;ndash;46}} The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in [[San Francisco]] and [[Seattle]] before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], and [[Auckland]].{{sfn|Albertson|pp=47&amp;ndash;56}}

The fleet then turned north for the Philippines, stopping in [[Manila]], before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in [[Yokohama]]. Three weeks of exercises followed in [[Subic Bay]] in the Philippines in November. The ships passed [[Singapore]] on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in [[Colombo]] before proceeding to the [[Suez Canal]] and coaling again at [[Port Said]], Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in [[Gibraltar]], where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled {{convert|46729|nmi}}. There, they conducted a [[naval review]] for President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Albertson|pp=57&amp;ndash;66}}

Upon her return, ''Minnesota'' was assigned to the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]]. She spent the following three years on the eastern coast of the United States conducting a peacetime routine of training cruises, apart from one voyage to the [[English Channel]]. Starting in 1912, the ship began to operate in the Caribbean, particularly after unrest began to break out in several countries in the region. For the first six months of 1912, she patrolled Cuban waters; she went to the US base at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanmo Bay]] to support the suppression of an insurrection on the island from 7 to 22 June. In mid 1913, she patrolled the eastern coast of Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. She returned in 1914, with stints there from 26 January to 7 August and 11 October to 19 December. During the first period, the United States [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupied Veracruz]] to protect US interests. In 1915, ''Minnesota'' returned to the United States and resumed her previous routine of training exercises with occasional cruises to the Caribbean. In November 1916, she was placed in reserve as the [[flagship]] of the Reserve Force, Atlantic Fleet.{{sfn|DANFS Minnesota}} 

[[File:USS Minnesota BB-22.jpg|thumb|''Minnesota'' at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]], c. 1919]]
''Minnesota'' returned to active service after the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, entering [[World War I]]. She was assigned to Division 4 of the [[Battleship Force]], based at [[Tangier Sound]] in [[Chesapeake Bay]]. She spent the war as a [[training ship]] for gunners and engine room personnel.{{sfn|DANFS Minnesota}} During this time, Vice Admiral [[Albert W. Grant]], the commander of Battleship Force 1, instituted a program to reinforce the bulkheads of the ships under his command. This improved their ability to absorb underwater damage and remain afloat. On 29 September 1918, while cruising off [[Fenwick Island (Delaware–Maryland)|Fenwick Island]] with the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Israel|DD-98|6}}, she struck a [[naval mine]] that had been laid by the [[U-boat]] [[SM U-117|''U-117'']], which inflicted serious damage but caused no casualties. The explosion tore a gaping hole in the hull from frame 5 to frame 16, and from the keel to the bottom edge of the armor belt. The bow flooded, but the repaired bulkheads prevented the flooding from spreading. Reduced to a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}, ''Minnesota'' made it back to the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] where repairs were effected. The work lasted for five months, by which time Germany had signed the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] that ended the war.{{sfn|DANFS Minnesota}}{{sfn|Jones|pp=115&amp;ndash;116}}

On 11 March 1919, ''Minnesota'' returned to service with the [[Cruiser and Transport Force]], making three trips to [[Brest, France]] to bring American soldiers back from the battlefields of Europe. In the course of the voyages, she brought back over 3,000&amp;nbsp;men; this duty ended on 23 July. The ship spent the next two years as a training ship for [[midshipmen]] from the [[US Naval Academy]]. She conducted two summer cruises in 1920 and 1921 before being decommissioned on 1 December 1921. She was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] the same day and was sold for scrap on 23 January 1924. ''Minnesota'' was thereafter [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.{{sfn|DANFS Minnesota}}
