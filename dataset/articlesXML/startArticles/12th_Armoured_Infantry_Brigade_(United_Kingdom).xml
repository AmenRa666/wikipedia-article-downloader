The '''12th Armoured Infantry Brigade''', formerly the 12th Mechanized Brigade, is a regular [[British Army]] [[brigade]] which has been in existence since 1899 and now forms part of [[3rd Mechanised Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Mechanised Division]].

==History==

===Second Boer War===
The brigade was first formed in December 1899 as 12th Infantry Brigade and saw action at the Battle of Rensburg, Battle of Norval's Point, Battle of Biddulph's Berg and Battle of Slabbert's Nek.&lt;ref name=modhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/History_of_12_Mech_Bde_HQ_and_Sig_Sqn.pdf |title=History of 12 Mech Bde HQ and Sig Sqn (228) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
During the First World War, the 12th Infantry Brigade, a [[regular army]] formation, was assigned to the [[British 4th Infantry Division|4th Infantry Division]]. It was dispatched to France, crossing the [[English Channel]] on 22 August 1914, as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) and saw action in the [[First Battle of the Marne]] beginning in September 1914. It then spent much of the rest of the conflict engaged in trench warfare.&lt;ref name=modhistory/&gt;

Brigade units during the First World War included:
*1st Battalion, [[King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)]]
*2nd Battalion, the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]]
*2nd Battalion, [[Essex Regiment]]
*2nd Battalion, [[Duke of Wellington's (West Riding Regiment)]] (from January 1916 to 10th Bde. February 1918)
*2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment (from March 1915, to 11th Bde. July 1915)
*1/5th Battalion, [[South Lancashire Regiment]] (from February 1915 until January 1916)
*1/2nd Battalion, [[Monmouthshire Regiment]] (until January 1916)

From early November 1915 until February 1916 the 12th Brigade was swapped with the [[107th Brigade]] of the [[36th (Ulster) Division]].

===Second World War===
[[File:The British Army in France 1940 F2038.jpg|thumb|left|Men of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers in a trench in front of the [[Maginot Line]], 3 January 1940.]]
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], except for a few brief periods of detachment, the brigade formed part of the 4th Infantry Division, as in the First World War. It was part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) and took part in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] in May 1940. The brigade remained in the United Kingdom for the next two years, preparing and training to repel [[Operation Sea Lion]], the German invasion of England, although that never arrived. It moved to North Africa in February 1943 to take part in the later stages of the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and saw action at the Battle of Oved Zara, the Battle of Medjez Plain and the Battle of Tunis. It then took part in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], moving to [[Naples]] in February 1944 and saw further action at the [[Battle of Monte Cassino#Fourth and final battle|Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino]]. By October 1944 the 4th Division was taking part in the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]'s battle on the [[Gothic Line]] but was withdrawn in November to spend the rest of the war in [[Greece]], part of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied force]] tasked to prevent civil unrest as rival factions attempted to fill the political vacuum when the Germans withdrew from the country.&lt;ref name=modhistory/&gt;

* 6th Battalion, Black Watch (''from March 1940'')
