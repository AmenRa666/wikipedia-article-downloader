The {{nihongo|'''''Kongō''-class''' battlecruiser|金剛型巡洋戦艦|Kongō-gata jun'yōsenkan}} was a [[Ship class|class]] of four [[battlecruiser]]s built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) immediately before [[World War I]]. Designed by British [[Naval architecture|naval architect]] [[George Thurston]], the [[Japanese battleship Kongō|lead ship of the class]] was the last Japanese [[capital ship]] constructed outside Japan, by [[Vickers]].&lt;ref name=kongoclass/&gt;

During the late 1920s, all but ''Hiei'' were reconstructed and reclassified as battleships. After the signing of the [[London Naval Treaty]] in 1930, ''Hiei'' was reconfigured as a [[training ship]] to avoid being [[ship breaking|scrapped]]. Following Japan's withdrawal from the [[London Naval Treaty]], all four underwent a massive second reconstruction in the late 1930s. Following the completion of these modifications, which increased top speeds to over {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}, all four were reclassified as [[fast battleship]]s.

The ''Kongō''-class battleships were the most active capital ships of the Japanese Navy during [[World War II]], participating in most major engagements of the war. ''Hiei'' and ''Kirishima'' acted as escorts during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], while ''Kongō'' and ''Haruna'' supported the [[Battle of Singapore|invasion of Singapore]]. All four participated in the battles of [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] and [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]]. ''Hiei'' and ''Kirishima'' were both lost during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] in November 1942, while ''Haruna'' and ''Kongō'' jointly bombarded [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]] on Guadalcanal. The two remaining Kongō-class battleships spent most of 1943 shuttling between Japanese naval bases before participating in the major naval campaigns of 1944. ''Haruna'' and ''Kongō'' engaged American surface vessels during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. ''Kongō'' was torpedoed by [[USS Sealion (SS-315)|USS ''Sealion'']] in November 1944, while ''Haruna'' was sunk at her [[Mooring (watercraft)|moorings]] by air attack in [[Kure Naval Base]] in late July 1945 and subsequently scrapped.

==Design==
The design of the ''Kongō''-class battlecruisers came about as a result of the IJN's modernization programs, as well as the perceived need to compete with the British [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=cfrecordkongo/&gt;

In March 1908, the Royal Navy launched {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}} at [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Armed with eight {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on|0}} main guns, ''Invincible'' rendered all current&amp;mdash;and designed&amp;mdash;Japanese capital ships obsolete by comparison.&lt;ref name=kongoclass/&gt; In 1911, the [[Diet of Japan|Japanese Diet]] passed the Emergency Naval Expansion Bill, authorizing the construction of one battleship ({{ship|Japanese battleship|Fusō||2}}) and four armoured cruisers, to be designed by British [[Naval architecture|naval architect]] [[George Thurston]]&lt;!--did the bill call for Thurston?  if not, how he came to be selected might be included--&gt;.&lt;ref name=cfrecordkongo/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's&quot;&gt;Gardiner and Gray (1980), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; In his design of the class, Thurston relied on many techniques that would eventually be used by the British on the {{sclass-|Tiger|battlecruiser|4}}.&lt;ref name=kongoclass/&gt;

Under the terms of the contract signed with [[Vickers]] in November 1910, one member of the ''Kongō'' class&amp;mdash;the [[lead ship]] ''Kongō''&amp;mdash;was to be built in Britain and Vickers were to maximize technology transfer to Japan. The design of the ships was from Vickers Design 472C (corresponding to the Japanese design designation B-46). The original design featured eight or ten 12-inch (304.8&amp;nbsp;mm) 50-caliber guns, sixteen {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns, and eight {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s. 
Cdr Katô Hirohasu pushed for the adoption of a new [[Vickers 14 inch/45 naval gun|{{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}}/45]] [[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] gun that was currently under development. After trials of the new gun, which were witnessed by both the Japanese Navy and Royal Navy, the Japanese made the decision on 29 Nov 1911 to use the new gun despite the keel having already been laid down on the 17 January 1911, and the resulting need to quickly make a large number of alternations to the design, so as to not prolong the construction.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The final design of the battlecruisers resulted in an improved version of the {{sclass-|Lion|battlecruiser|4}}, displacing an estimated 27,940&amp;nbsp;tonnes (27,500&amp;nbsp;long tons).&lt;ref name=jackson-03-48&gt;Jackson (2000), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; It also called for eight 14-inch guns mounted in four twin [[gun turret]]s (two forward and two aft) with a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson-08-27&quot;&gt;Jackson (2008), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure transfer of the latest design knowledge to Japan more than 100 technical specialists were sent on 18 months secondments from Japan to Vickers during the construction phase of ''Kongō''. If superintendents, supervisors and trial witnesses are also included then approximately 200 Japanese spent time in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The ships had a length of {{convert|214.58|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]] and a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28.04|m|ftin|sp=us}}. They had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|8.22|m|ftin|sp=us}} and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|27384|t|LT|sp=us}} at normal load.&lt;ref name=l5/&gt;

===Propulsion===
The ''Kongō''-class ships had two sets of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] direct-drive [[steam turbine]]s, except for ''Haruna''{{'}}s [[John Brown and Company|Brown-Curtis]] turbines, each of which drove two propeller shafts. The high-pressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the low-pressure turbines drove the inner shafts. The turbines were arranged in two compartments, separated by a centerline longitudinal [[Bulkhead (partition)|Bulkhead]]; both compartments were situated between turrets No. 3 and 4. They were designed to produce a total of {{convert|65000|shp|lk=in}}, using steam provided by 36 [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] or Kampon [[water-tube boiler]]s, with working pressures ranging from {{convert|17.1|to|19.2|atm|kPa psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, pp. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The boilers, arranged in eight compartments, were mixed-firing with [[fuel oil]] sprayed onto the coal for extra power. The ships had a stowage capacity of {{convert|4200|LT|t|abbr=on}} of coal and {{convert|1000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of oil, giving them a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|14|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 178, 180&lt;/ref&gt; The battlecruisers were designed to reach a speed of {{convert|27.5|kn}} and all of them exceeded that speed on their [[sea trial]]s. ''Kongō'' and ''Hiei'' attained {{convert|27.54|kn}} and {{convert|27.72|kn}} with {{convert|78275|shp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|76127|shp|abbr=on}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In their first reconstruction during the late 1920s, the ships were reboilered with 10, 11 (''Hiei'') or 16 (''Haruna'') Kampon boilers and their fuel stowage was rearranged to accommodate {{convert|2661|LT|t|abbr=on}} of coal and {{convert|3292|LT|t|abbr=on}} of oil. This increased their range to {{convert|8930|nmi|lk=in}} at 14 knots and allowed the fore [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] to be removed, which greatly decreased smoke interference with the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and [[fire-control system]]s. Coupled with the addition of external torpedo bulges, this reduced their speed to {{convert|26|kn}} and caused the IJN to reclassify them as battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Wiper, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=j5/&gt; During their 1930s reconstructions into fast battleships, the existing boilers were removed and replaced with eleven oil-fired Kampon boilers.&lt;ref name=cfrecordharuna/&gt; These upgraded boilers gave the ''Kongō'' and her [[sister ship]]s much greater power, with the class capable of speeds exceeding {{convert|30.5|kn}}. This made them the only Japanese battleships fully suited to operations alongside fast carriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson-08-27&quot;/&gt;

===Armament===
[[File:Haruna 14 inch gun installation 1914.jpg|thumb|right|A 14-inch gun being installed aboard ''Haruna'', October 1914]]
The primary armament of the ''Kongō'' class consisted of eight 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[Vickers 14 inch/45 naval gun|14-inch]] guns, mounted in four [[superfire|superfiring]] twin-gun turrets.&lt;ref name=kongoclass/&gt; The turrets had an elevation capability of &amp;minus;5/+20 degrees except in ''Kongō'' whose turrets had a maximum elevation capability of +25 degrees. The shells could be loaded at any angle&lt;ref name=l7&gt;Lengerer, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; and the guns had a firing cycle of 30–40 seconds.&lt;ref name=c3&gt;Campbell, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; These guns and their turrets underwent multiple modernizations throughout the ships' careers. During the first reconstruction of the class during the 1920s, the elevation of the main guns was increased to a maximum of +33 degrees. The recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to pneumatic system, which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

By World War II, the guns used Type 91 [[Armour-piercing capped#Armor-piercing|armor-piercing, capped shells]]. Each of these shells weighed {{convert|673.5|kg|lb|sp=us}} and had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|775|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}. They had a maximum range of {{convert|25000|m|yd|sp=us}} at +20 degrees of elevation&lt;ref name=c3/&gt; and {{convert|35450|m|yd|sp=us}} at +43 degrees after modernisation.&lt;ref name=skulski19&gt;Skulski, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Also available was a {{convert|625|kg|lb|sp=us|adj=on}} [[Armour-piercing capped#High-explosive|high-explosive shell]] that had a muzzle velocity of {{convert|805|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}. A special Type 3 ''Sanshikidan'' incendiary [[shrapnel shell]] was developed in the 1930s for anti-aircraft use.&lt;ref name=c3/&gt;

As built, the ''Kongō'' class was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50-caliber [[15 cm/50 41st Year Type|six-inch guns]] mounted in single [[casemate]]s along the sides of the hull at the level of the upper deck. Eight guns were mounted per side, and each had an arc of fire of 130 degrees and a maximum elevation of +15 degrees. Each gun could fire a {{convert|45.36|kg|lb|adj=on|0}} [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]] projectile a maximum distance of {{convert|22970|yd|m}} at a rate of between four and six shots per minute. During their reconstruction in the 1930s, the maximum elevation of the guns was increased to +30 degrees, which increased their maximum range by approximately {{convert|900|m|yd}}.&lt;ref name=skulski20&gt;Skulski, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; During their second reconstruction, two of these guns were removed from each ship, bringing the total to fourteen six-inch guns.

The ships also mounted four 40-caliber [[8&amp;nbsp;cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun|76 mm]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft (AA)]] guns. The {{convert|76|mm|0|adj=on}} high-angle guns were in single mounts. Each of these guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and could fire a {{convert|6|kg|lb|abbr=on}} projectile with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|680|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to a maximum height of {{convert|7500|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=skulski20/&gt; Both ships were equipped with eight submerged {{convert|533|mm|in|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, four on each [[broadside]].&lt;ref name=stille15&gt;Stille, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kongō'' class's secondary armament changed significantly over time. During the modernizations of the 1930s, all of the 76&amp;nbsp;mm guns were replaced with eight 40-caliber {{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[dual-purpose gun]]s. These guns were fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;skulski19&quot; /&gt; When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of {{convert|14700|m|yd}}; they had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|9440|m|ft}} at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 192–93&lt;/ref&gt; During reconstruction, the two foremost 152&amp;nbsp;mm guns were also removed.&lt;ref name=skulski30&gt;Skulski, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The light AA armament of the ''Kongō'' class changed dramatically from 1933 to 1944. During the second reconstruction, the ships were fitted with four to eight twin {{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on|sp=us}} machine-guns, later replaced by {{convert|25|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} gun mounts. Both weapons were license-built French [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 200, 202&lt;/ref&gt; The 25&amp;nbsp;mm guns were mounted on the ''Kongō'' class in single, double and triple mounts. This model was the standard Japanese light anti-aircraft gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. The twin and triple mounts &quot;lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast&quot;.&lt;ref name=stille11&gt;Stille, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; ''Haruna'' ultimately carried 118 guns in 30 triple, two twin and 24 single mounts.

===Armour===
The ''Kongō''-class battlecruisers were designed with the intention of maximizing speed and maneuverability, and as such were not as heavily armoured as later Japanese capital ships.&lt;ref name=kongoclass/&gt; Nevertheless, the ''Kongō'' class possessed significant quantities of armour, and were heavily upgraded during their modernizations. In their initial configuration, the ''Kongō'' class possessed an upper belt that was {{convert|6|in|mm|0}} thick, and a lower belt with a thickness of {{convert|8|in|mm|0}}.&lt;ref name=jane-19-165&gt;Moore, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Vickers Cemented was used in the construction of the ''Kongō'', while the original armour of the other three was constructed of a variation of [[Krupp armour|Krupp Cemented Armour]], designed by the German [[Krupp Arms Works]].&lt;ref name=jane-19-165/&gt; Subsequent developments of Japanese armour technology relied upon a hybrid design of the two variations until drastic changes were made during the design of the ''Yamato'' class in 1938. The armoured belt near the bow and stern of the vessels was strengthened with an additional {{convert|3|in|mm}} of cemented armour.&lt;ref name=jane-19-165/&gt; The conning tower of the ''Kongō'' class was very heavily armoured, with variations of Krupp Cemented Armour up to {{convert|14|in|mm}} thick.&lt;ref name=jane-19-165/&gt; The turrets were lightly armoured compared to later designs, with a maximum plate thickness of {{convert|9|in|mm|0}}.&lt;ref name=kongoclass/&gt; The deck armour ranged from {{convert|1.5|to|2.75|in|mm|0}}.&lt;ref name=kongoclass&gt;{{cite web |url= http://combinedfleet.com/ships/kongo|work= Combined Fleet - ''Kongo'' class|author1=Parshall, Jon |author2=Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, |author3=Allyn Nevitt |title=Kongo-class Battleship|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reconstructions that each ship underwent during the interwar period, most of the armour of the ''Kongō'' class was heavily upgraded. The main lower belt was strengthened to be a uniform thickness of 8&amp;nbsp;inches, while diagonal bulkheads of a depth ranging from {{convert|5|to|8|in|mm|0}} reinforced the main armoured belt.&lt;ref name=mccurtie185&gt;McCurtie, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; The upper belt remained unchanged, but was closed by 9-inch bulkheads at the bow and stern of the ships.&lt;ref name=mccurtie185/&gt; The turret armour was strengthened to {{convert|10|in|mm|0}}, while {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} were added to portions of the deck armour.&lt;ref name=mccurtie185/&gt; The armour upgrades increased the displacement by close to 4,000 tons on each ship, violating the terms of the Washington Treaty.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson-08-27&quot;/&gt; Even after these modifications, the armour capacity of the ''Kongō'' class remained much less than that of newer capital ships, a factor which played a major role in the sinking of ''Hiei'' and ''Kirishima'' at the hands of U.S. Navy cruisers and battleships in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Stille, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
