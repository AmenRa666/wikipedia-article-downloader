These vessels will enable a Naval Task Force to remain at sea for six times longer than is currently possible. The Joint Support ships will provide the RCN with a greater flexibility to conduct a wide range of operations both domestically and internationally. Originally announced in 2004, a contract for the construction of these ships was to have been signed in 2009. They were to have been available for operational service in 2012. As of January 2012, contract for the construction of these ships has not been signed and proposed entry into service has been set back by five years to 2017.  The RCN has concluded that the {{Sclass-|Berlin|replenishment ship|1}} and the [[SPS Cantabria (A15)|''Cantabria'' class]] are the only candidates for adaptation as it can be adapted to meet the Canadian Forces requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casr.ca/doc-acan-jss-aor.htm|title=JSS Morphs into MOTS AOR Replacement: Sizing Up NATO Oilers Instead of Ogling All-in-One JSS Designs|date=2011-11-23|accessdate=2011-11-23|publisher=[[Canadian American Strategic Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Berlin-class replenishment ship|Berlin Class AOR]] was selected on June 2, 2013.&lt;ref name=JSSSelection&gt;http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-eng.asp?id=4821 Backgrounder: Joint Support Ship Design Decision&lt;/ref&gt;  The ships are scheduled to be built starting in 2017.

It had been intended to retain the ‘mid-lifed’ vessels through 2045–2055 however, the Royal Canadian Navy has concluded that the money would be better spent in acquiring a new platform. RCN's review listed low speed and small size as reasons for the MCDV being inadequate for patrol duties (both are factors of the original specification). Critics note that patrol and training were tacked onto the mine-countermeasures role and that the platform lacks serious armament for a sovereignty enforcement role.&lt;ref name=CasrMCDVMidlife1/&gt; As of January 2012, a contract for the construction of these ships has not been signed.

The Space Situational Awareness capability will address this concern by providing military Commanders with increased awareness of satellite over flights in theatres of operation. The Space Situational Awareness capability will provide for the monitoring and analysis of the location and status of adversarial and third party commercial space resources. This includes providing information on threats posed by adversarial space assets to deployed CF elements and enabling commanders to account for potential space threats in their operational planning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfd-cdf.forces.gc.ca/sites/page-eng.asp?page=6251,Joint Space Support Project (JSSP)&lt;/ref&gt;  ||

|Tactical Satellite-Based Imagery System - Space and Ground Segments - Upgrade || Polar Epsilon - Radarsat Constellation || 1   || 2014-15  || MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates, Ltd. || The Polar Epsilon project was approved on May 30, 2005. It uses information from RADARSAT-2, launched in December 2007, to produce imagery for Canadian military commanders to use in order to conduct operations in their areas of responsibility. The RADARSAT-2 information is used in many ways, including surveillance of Canada’s Arctic region and maritime approaches, the detection of vessels, and support to CF operations globally. The implementation phase of Polar Epsilon began in March 2009 with the design and construction phase of two new RADARSAT-2 ground stations, by MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates (MDA), one on the east coast in Masstown, N.S., and the other on the west coast in Aldergrove, B.C. The ground stations will be wholly owned and operated by the Government of Canada and are expected to be operational by March 2011. Completion of the Polar Epsilon project is expected by late 2011. The three satellites forming the [[RADARSAT Constellation]] scheduled for launch in 2014-15, will provide continuity of data for Polar Epsilon.   |||| ||

|New Defence Headquarters  || National Defence Headquarters Ottawa  ||  1 || 2016 - 18  ||   || In late 2011 DND purchased the former campus of Nortel on Carling Avenue, in the west end of Ottawa for $208 million in order to establish a new headquarters facility there. The campus consists of 12 buildings on approximately 28 hectares that were owned by Nortel and 120 hectares leased from the National Capital Commission. An additional $630 million will be spent to refit the site and construct a new operational command building. Up to 10,000 military and civilian personnel will eventually work there. The move to the former Nortel campus will reduce the number of Defence Department and Canadian Forces locations in Ottawa and Gatineau from 48 to seven or less. DND’s main headquarters, the Major-General George R. Pearkes Building on Colonel By Drive, and its facility on Star Top Road will continue to be used. The Pearkes building was intended for Transport Canada, but in 1974 became DND headquarters. In 2008, DND came up with its long-term office accommodation strategy, which included a reduced headquarters building at Colonel By Drive, a continued presence in Gatineau and a consolidated campus that included a new operational command building.&lt;ref&gt;The Ottawa Citizen, David Pugliese, DND to spend $630 million preparing Nortel campus
