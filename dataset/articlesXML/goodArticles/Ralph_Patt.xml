'''Ralph Oliver Patt''' (5 December 1929 – 6 October 2010) was an American jazz-guitarist who introduced [[major-thirds tuning]]. Patt's tuning simplified the learning of the [[fretboard]] and [[guitar chord|chord]]s by beginners and [[improvisation]] by advanced guitarists. He invented major-thirds tuning under the inspiration of first the [[atonal music]] of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and second  the [[free jazz|jazz]] of [[John Coltrane]] and [[Ornette Coleman]].

He graduated with a degree in geology from the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. After his career as a guitarist, he worked as a geologist and as a hydrologist, often consulting on projects related to the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Energy]].

==Biography==

Patt was born in [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]] on 5 December 1929&lt;ref name=&quot;DR&quot;/&gt; and studied  geology at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PattBio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;/&gt;

===Guitar and music theory===
While in Pittsburgh, Patt studied guitar under [[Joe&amp;nbsp;Negri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PattBio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;[[Joe Negri]] and Patt collaborated in 1989 on this recording:

By then, Negri was already nationally known as the guitarist on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] children's television-show [[Mr.&amp;nbsp;Rogers' Neighborhood]], on which he also appeared as &quot;[[Mr.&amp;nbsp;Rogers Neighborhood#Handyman Negri|Handyman&amp;nbsp;Negri]]&quot;.

After touring for five years, Patt settled in New York City, where he worked as musician both at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and on [[Broadway musical|Broadway]] from&amp;nbsp;1960 to&amp;nbsp;1970; during this period he regarded [[Barry&amp;nbsp;Galbraith]] as his mentor. He studied under [[George Russell (composer)|George&amp;nbsp;Russell]],&lt;ref name=&quot;PattBio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson36&quot;/&gt; whose (1959) ''[[Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization]]'' Patt  edited.&lt;ref name=&quot;PattBio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;My grateful acknowledgement to ...

Patt wanted to be able to play and then to improvise twelve-tone music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson36&quot;/&gt;

====Major-thirds tuning====
{{Main article|Major-thirds tuning}}

Patt was inspired by the [[free jazz|jazz]] of [[Ornette&amp;nbsp;Coleman]] and [[John&amp;nbsp;Coltrane]] and the [[atonal music]] of Schoenberg. Seeking a [[guitar tuning|guitar-tuning]] that would facilitate [[improvisation]],  he introduced [[major-thirds tuning]] by 1964,&lt;ref name=&quot;Griewank1&quot; &gt;{{harvtxt|Griewank|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkeby&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Ole|last=Kirkeby|date=1 March 2012|title=Major&amp;nbsp;thirds tuning|accessdate=10 June 2012|ref=harv|url=http://v3p1.m3guitar.com/html/tuning.html|publisher=m3guitar.com|id=cited by {{harvtxt|Sethares|2011}} and {{harv|Griewank|2010|p=1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ralphpatt.com/Tune.html|first=Ralph|last=Patt|publisher=ralphpatt.com|work=Ralph&amp;nbsp;Patt's jazz web page|title=The major&amp;nbsp;3rd tuning|ref=harv|date=14 April 2008|accessdate=10 June 2012|id=cited by {{harvtxt|Sethares|2011}} and {{harvtxt|Griewank|2010|p=1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson36&quot; &gt;{{harvtxt|Peterson|2002|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patt's tuning is a [[regular tunings|regular tuning]] in the sense that all of the [[interval (music)|interval]]s between its successive [[open string (music)|open string]]s are [[major third]]s; in contrast, the [[standard guitar-tuning]] has one major-third amid four [[perfect fourth|fourth]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sethares2001&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of his work as a [[session musician]] after 1965 in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson36&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patt&quot;/&gt;

Major-thirds tuning packs the [[chromatic scale]] (the consecutive twelve-notes of the [[octave]]) onto four consecutive frets of three consecutive strings, an arrangement that reduces the extensions of the little and index fingers (&quot;hand stretching&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Griewank|2010|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[major chord|Major]] and [[minor chord]]s are played on two successive frets, and so require only two fingers; other chords—[[second chord|seconds]], [[fourth chord|fourths]], [[seventh chord|sevenths]], and [[ninth chord|ninths]]—are played on three successive frets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griewank2&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Griewank|2010|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For each regular tuning,  chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard, a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and that simplifies advanced players' [[improvisation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkeby&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Regular52&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2001|p=52}}&lt;!-- :{{cite book|chapter=Regular&amp;nbsp;tunings|title=Alternate tuning guide|first=Bill|last=Sethares|authorlink=William Sethares|year=2001|pages=52–67|url=http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/alternatetunings/regulartunings.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin; Department of Electrical Engineering|location=Madison, Wisconsin|ref=harv|accessdate=19 May 2012|id=[http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/alternatetunings/alltunings.pdf 2010 ''Alternate&amp;nbsp;tuning guide'', including a revised chapter on regular tunings]}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, chords cannot be shifted around the fretboard in the standard tuning E-A-D-G-B-E, which requires four chord-shapes for the major chords; standard tuning has separate chord-forms for chords having their [[root note]] on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth strings.&lt;ref name=&quot;DenyerIntervals&quot; &gt;{{harvtxt|Denyer|1992|loc=&quot;The harmonic guitarist, Intervals, Fingerboard intervals&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having exactly three [[pitch class]]es for its open notes (for example {C,E,G{{music|sharp}}}), each major-thirds tuning [[repetitive tuning|repeats every note in a higher octave]], because guitars have six strings. Being regular, M3 tunings repeat each note after two strings: this repetition simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkeby&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Ole|last=Kirkeby|date=1 March 2012|title=Major&amp;nbsp;thirds tuning|accessdate=10 June 2012|ref=harv|url=http://v3p1.m3guitar.com/html/tuning.html|publisher=m3guitar.com|id=cited by {{harvtxt|Sethares|2011}} and {{harvtxt|Griewank|2010|p=1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chord inversion]] is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griewank10&quot; &gt;{{harvtxt|Griewank|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KirkebyMajor&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Kirkeby|2012|loc=[http://v3p0.m3guitar.com/html/fretmaps_chords_major.html &quot;Fretmaps, major chords: Major Triads&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Guitars with seven and eight strings=====
[[File:Eight-string acoustic-electric guitar of Ralph Patt.jpg|right|thumb|Saul Koll built this eight-string guitar for Ralph Patt to play in major thirds.]]

Major-thirds tuning has a smaller scope than standard guitar-tuning,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sethares2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson37&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Peterson|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Patt started using [[seven-string guitar]]s, which enabled major-thirds tuning to have the E-e' range of the standard tuning. He first experimented with a wide-neck Mango guitar from the 1920s, which he modified to have seven strings in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson36&quot;/&gt; In 1967 he purchased a [[seven-string guitar|seven-string]] by José Rubio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson37&quot;/&gt; Patt used major-thirds tuning when he performed as a [[session musician]] in New York City after 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson36&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patt&quot;/&gt;

Later, he purchased six-string [[archtop guitar|archtop]] [[semi-acoustic guitar|hollow-body]] guitars that were then modified by luthiers to have wider necks, wider pickups, and [[eight-string guitar|eight string]]s. Patt's [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[Gibson ES-150|ES-150]] was modified by Vincent &quot;Jimmy&quot; DiSerio, a luthier who worked in the firm of [[John D'Angelico]], circa 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson37&quot;/&gt; Luthier [[Saul Koll]] modified a sequence of guitars: a 1938 Gibson Cromwell, a Sears Silvertone, a circa 1922 Mango archtop, a 1951 Gibson L-50, and a 1932 [[Epiphone Guitars|Epiphone]] Broadway; for Koll's modifications, custom pick-ups accommodated Patt's wide necks and high G{{music|sharp}} ([[enharmonic equivalency|equivalently]] A{{music|flat}});&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson37&quot;/&gt; custom [[pick up (music technology)|pick-up]]s were manufactured by [[Seymour&amp;nbsp;Duncan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson37&quot;/&gt; and by Bill&amp;nbsp;Lawrence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patt&quot;/&gt;

Besides these guitars, Patt regularly played other stringed instruments as a recording musician: [[classical guitar]], [[12-string guitar]], [[six-string bass guitar|6-string bass guitar]], [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], and [[oud]]. Patt stated that &quot;the only guys that didn't have to double on dates were the Tony Mottolas and the Johnny Smiths&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson37&quot;/&gt; [[Tony&amp;nbsp;Mottola]] and [[Johnny&amp;nbsp;Smith]] were famous jazz-guitarists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/678129101.html?dids=678129101:678129101&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+13%2C+2004&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=PASSINGS%3B+Tony+Mottola%2C+86%3B+Composer%2C+Guitarist+Played+With+Sinatra&amp;pqatl=google|title=Tony Mottola; 86; Composer, guitarist played with Sinatra|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=13 August 2004|accessdate=28 March 2011|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Denyer|1992|loc=&quot;Playing the guitar: Jazz guitar styles, The role of the guitar in jazz&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;101}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;doubling&quot; refers to a musician's switching from one instrument to another, particularly within a family of instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kostka|Payne|Almén|2012|p=92}}:

====Scholarship====

Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major-thirds tuning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2011|loc=[http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/alternatetunings/alternatetunings.html &quot;Alternative tuning guide&quot;] (html)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This webpage was part of website with extensive information for jazz guitarists. {{anchor|The Vanilla Book}}{{anchor|Vanilla Book}}{{anchor|Vanilla book}}{{anchor|The vanilla book}}Patt's website published his ''Vanilla book'', which contains the [[chord progression]]s for four-hundred [[jazz&amp;nbsp;standard]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanilla&quot;/&gt; from &quot;[[After You've Gone (song)|After you've gone]]&quot; to &quot;[[Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart|Zing! went the strings]]&quot;. Its title refers to  &quot;Just play the vanilla&amp;nbsp;changes&quot;, advice to young pianists from [[Lester Young]]. It was updated in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanilla&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ralphpatt.com/VBook.html|first=Ralph|last=Patt|publisher=ralphpatt.com|work=Ralph&amp;nbsp;Patt's jazz web page|title=About ''The vanilla&amp;nbsp;book''|ref=harv|date=14 April 2008|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His website followed earlier contributions to guitar scholarship and instruction. In 1962, Patt wrote his  ''Guitar&amp;nbsp;chord dictionary'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Patt|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in New&amp;nbsp;York City in the 1960s, he studied with [[Chuck&amp;nbsp;Wayne]], with whom he wrote ''The guitar&amp;nbsp;appreggio dictionary'' (1965),&lt;ref name=&quot;PattBio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wayne|Patt|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the bestselling titles from the music-publishing firm of [[Henry Adler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The purchaser's guide to the music industries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cAgAQAAIAAJ|year=1966|page=343|ref=harv|accessdate=5 October 2012|first1=John C.|last1=Freund|first2=Milton|last2=Weil|publisher=Music Trades Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to geology===
As a studio musician in the 1970s, Patt had to play less jazz and more rock and roll, and so he changed careers. He returned to geology  while continuing to pursue jazz as an avocation.
