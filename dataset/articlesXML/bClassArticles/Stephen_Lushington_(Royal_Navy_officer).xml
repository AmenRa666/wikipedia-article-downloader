'''Sir Stephen Lushington''' [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] (12 December 1803&amp;nbsp;– 28 May 1877) was an officer in the [[Royal Navy]] who served during the [[Crimean War]]. Long and distinguished service in the Mediterranean brought him honours and rewards.

Lushington was born into a [[gentry]] family, the son of a baronet, while his uncle was a judge and a member of parliament. Stephen entered the navy shortly after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and after serving under a number of officers in far flung locations like the Mediterranean and the South American coast, rose through the ranks. He was particularly active against pirates in the [[Aegean Sea]] and was promoted to lieutenant after a number of boat actions. He returned to the Mediterranean at his new rank and saw action at the [[Battle of Navarino]], where the British were allied with the Russians against the Ottoman forces. Lushington came to the attention of Admiral [[Edward Codrington|Sir Edward Codrington]], the British commander in chief, and was soon promoted to his own command, that of a [[bomb vessel]]. He distinguished himself while supporting French operations in the [[Morea expedition]], and received French and Greek honours for his part in attack on an Ottoman position, as well as the professional approbation of the French naval commander.

Though promoted to [[post captain]], Lushington went on to spend ten years without a ship. Returning to service in 1839, he went out to the West Indies, but had to return home due to illness. He went on to command more ships in the Mediterranean, and was there when the [[Crimean War]] broke out. Operating this time against the Russians and in alliance with the Ottomans, Lushington took command of the [[naval brigade]] and won further honours. He was promoted to flag rank and received honours from the French and Ottomans, as well as from the British government. He rose to admiral during his last years, served as lieutenant-governor of [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]], and died in 1877 a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the Bath]] and with a collection of foreign honours.

==Family and early life==
[[File:HMS Owen Glendower.jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Owen Glendower|1808|6}}, c. 1820s. Depicted at about the time of Lushington's service aboard her.]]
Stephen Lushington was born on 12 December 1803, the second son of Sir Henry Lushington, 2nd Baronet, and his wife, Fanny Maria. Fanny was the eldest daughter of Matthew Lewis, under-secretary at war. Stephen's uncle was [[Stephen Lushington (judge)|Dr Stephen Lushington]], a renowned legal expert, judge and member of parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD684&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Byrne|title=A Naval Biographical Dictionary|page=684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Laughton|chapter=Lushington, Stephen (1803-1877)|chapterurl=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lushington,_Stephen_%281803-1877%29_%28DNB00%29|title=Dictionary of National Biography|page=293|volume=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Stephen Lushington embarked on a naval career, joining the 36-gun {{HMS|Tagus|1813|6}} on 17 October 1816 under Captain [[James Whitley Deans Dundas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD684&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; He was initially stationed in the Mediterranean, though in spring 1817 he transferred to the 26-gun {{HMS|Ganymede|1809|6}} under Captain [[Robert Cavendish Spencer|the Hon. Robert Cavendish Spencer]], serving as a [[midshipman]], and then went out to South America. Lushington followed Spencer to his next command, the 36-gun {{HMS|Owen Glendower|1808|6}} from August 1819, and remained aboard her until 1821.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD684&quot;/&gt; He returned to the Mediterranean after this period of service, and joined the 20-gun {{HMS|Hind|1814|6}} under Captain [[Henry John Rous|the Hon. Henry John Rous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD684&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;

Lushington was particularly active in the cruises against pirates in the [[Aegean Sea]], and took part in a number of boat actions, that saw him promoted to lieutenant on 13 July 1824.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD685&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Byrne|title=A Naval Biographical Dictionary|page=685}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB88&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall|title=Royal Naval Biography|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; His promotion was followed by an appointment to the 18-gun sloop {{HMS|Zebra|1815|6}} under Commander Edward Richard Williams on 5 February 1825. ''Zebra'' was at this time fitting out for the Mediterranean, and sometime after his arrival there, on 7 December 1825, he transferred to the 48-gun {{HMS|Cambrian|1797|6}} under Captain [[Gawen William Hamilton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD685&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB88&quot;/&gt; He was still with ''Cambrian'' in 1827, and saw action at the [[Battle of Navarino]] on 20 October 1827.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; His service, including continued action with pirates while with ''Cambrian'', brought him to Admiral [[Edward Codrington|Sir Edward Codrington's]] attention. Four days after Navarino Codrington arranged for him to be transferred into his [[flagship]], the 84-gun {{HMS|Asia|1824|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD685&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB88&quot;/&gt;{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} He served on the flagship until his promotion to his first command, the [[bomb vessel]] {{HMS|Aetna|1824|6}} on 13 May 1828.&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB88&quot;/&gt;

==Command==
Lushington supported the [[Morea expedition]] during 1828, and was part of a squadron under Captain [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons|Edmund Lyons]] aboard {{HMS|Blonde|1819|6}} working with the French fleet under Vice-Admiral [[Henri de Rigny]]. Lushington played a distinguished part in the attack and capture of the Kastro Morea on 30 October 1828.&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB88&quot;/&gt; The French force, consisting of de Rigny's flagship, the 80-gun [[French ship Conquérant (1812)|''Conquérant'']], and three frigates, the [[French ship Duchesse de Berri|''Duchesse de Berri'']], [[French frigate Didon (1828)|''Didon'']] and ''Armide'' were supporting a land assault by Generals [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]] and [[Antoine Virgile Schneider]]. Vice-Admiral [[Pulteney Malcolm]] forwarded Rigny's letter to the [[Admiralty]], noting that it showed Lushington's &quot;exertions and skill.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB89&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall|title=Royal Naval Biography|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigny himself wrote &quot;''Je me plais à reconnaître le active, et cordiale assistance, que vous ainsi que les officiers et marines sous vos ordres, nous ont donnée, soit avant, soit depuis mon arrivée ici, et particulièrement, dans le journée, d'hier, ou les cannons de la Blonde, et le service de la bombarde du Capitaine Lushington, ont tant contribué à abréger le resistance du chateau de Morée.''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB89&quot;/&gt;{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}
[[File:HMS Vengeance.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Vengeance|1824|6}}, Lushington's command from 1847 until 1848]]
For their services both Lushington and Lyons were nominated as [[Order of Saint Louis|Chevaliers of the Order of Saint Louis]] by the French, and appointed to the [[Order of the Redeemer]] by the Greeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD685&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB89&quot;/&gt; Lushington's promotion to [[post captain]] did not come for some time though, though he was finally posted on 28 October 1829.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD685&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB90&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall|title=Royal Naval Biography|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; A long period of unemployment followed, he was ashore for nearly ten years before finally appointed to take command of the 26-gun {{HMS|Cleopatra|1835|6}} on 19 January 1839, and sail her to the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD685&quot;/&gt; He became ill while on this station, and after a long period of ill-health, was invalided back to Britain in November 1840 on the orders of the station commander, [[Thomas Harvey (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Thomas Harvey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD685&quot;/&gt; Lushington's health presumably recovered while in England, and on 11 October 1845 he took command of the paddle frigate {{HMS|Retribution|1844|6}}. He commanded her in home waters until 1846, and then took over the 84-gun {{HMS|Vengeance|1824|6}} in 1847.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD685&quot;/&gt; He took ''Vengeance'' out to the Mediterranean, and left her in November 1848 to take up the post of superintendent of the Indian navy, which he held until 1852. He went to sea again in July 1852 as captain of the 90-gun {{HMS|Albion|1842|6}}, sailing out to the Mediterranean, and was still there when the [[Crimean War]] broke out in 1854.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;

==Crimea and flag rank==
[[File:William Simpson - Attack on the Malakoff.jpg|thumb|right|''The Attack on the Malakoff'', October 1855, by [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]]. Lushington commanded the naval brigade ashore during operations to capture Sevastopol.]]
Lushington sailed into the [[Black Sea]] with the rest of the allied fleet and joined the forces [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|laying siege to Sevastopol]]. He went ashore in command of the [[naval brigade]] and distinguished himself in the actions which followed. During his time in the Crimea he met and became friends with [[Fanny Duberly|Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Duberly]], arranging for a hut to be built for her to allow her to live on shore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duberly&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Duberly|title=Mrs Duberly's War|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny Duberly recorded of Lushington that &quot;I like him because he is clever, energetic &amp; resolute and I am not afraid of him when he chooses to say disagreeable personalities which he sometimes likes to do to shew off his sharpness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duberly&quot;/&gt; Lushington for his part teased her by calling her &quot;wilful and wayward&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duberly&quot;/&gt;

Lushington was promoted to [[rear admiral (Royal Navy)|rear-admiral]] on 4 July 1855, and the following day was nominated a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Bath]], an ''Officier'' and ''Commandeur'' of the [[Legion of Honour]] by France, and decorated with the [[Order of the Medjidie]], Second Class, by the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; On his departure from the Crimea Fanny Duberly noted that he was returning &quot;laden with honours to England. And what well deserved honours they are, and must be, for this reason, that not one man out in the campaign has made an observation implying that his distinctions were cheaply earned, or that he had been rewarded above his merit; and as such observations are very rife in the camp on like occasions, I think that their absence now is the surest sign that 'his honours do become him well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duberly&quot;/&gt; Lushington was succeeded in command of the naval brigade by Captain [[Henry Keppel|the Hon. Henry Keppel]], of {{HMS|St Jean d'Acre|1853|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duberly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingston&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kingston|title=Our Sailors|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, [[South East Coast of America Station]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowBiog.php?id=135|title=Stephen Lushington|publisher=William Loney|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lushington does not appear to have had further active service, but was lieutenant-governor of [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]] between 1862 and 1865, an appointment that denied him further promotions. When he relinquished the post, he was at once promoted to [[vice admiral (Royal Navy)|vice-admiral]] on 1 October 1865, with his seniority backdated to when he first took it up, between April and October 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; A further promotion followed, to full [[admiral (Royal Navy)|admiral]] on 2 December 1865, and on 13 March 1867 he was nominated a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the Bath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; He had married Henrietta Prescott, the eldest daughter of Rear-Admiral [[Henry Prescott]], on 5 July 1841, and the couple left issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD685&quot;/&gt; Lady Lushington died in 1875, and Admiral Sir Stephen Lushington died two years later, on 28 May 1877 at Oak Lodge, [[Thornton Heath]], Surrey.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} John Marshall's ''Royal Naval Biography'' has the transfer taking place &quot;Four days after the battle...&quot;, i.e. 24 October, while [[William Richard O'Byrne]]'s ''Naval Biographical Dictionary'' also states it took place on 24 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBD685&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB88&quot;/&gt; [[John Knox Laughton]] in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' instead states that it took place &quot;Three days [after the battle]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;

'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} Translated as &quot;I would like to recognize the active and cordial support you and the officers and marines under your command have given us, either before or since my arrival here, particularly in the day, yesterday, the cannons of the Blonde and the service of the bomb of Captain Lushington, have both contributed to shorten the resistance of the castle of Moree.&quot;
