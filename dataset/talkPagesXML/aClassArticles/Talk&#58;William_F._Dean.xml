==Request for outside source to confirm B-class==
B-class confirmed. However, a number of typos were fixed and listed in the article's edit summary. I also split two long sentences in half for clarity. In the WW2 section I cannot quite understand the sentence that includes &quot;10th Armored&quot;. This was left alone because any fix I make might change the intended meaning. Please check. Thanks.

== Military Govenor? ==

[[John R. Hodge]] is described as the military governor here and on his own page.  But on the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] page Dean is listed as military governor, but not Hodge.  If Hodge was not military govenor, what was his official title? If Dean was military governor, why is he described as a deputy?--[[User:Jack Upland|Jack Upland]] ([[User talk:Jack Upland|talk]]) 01:59, 28 April 2013 (UTC)

== World War I Victory Medal ==

According to this article Dean was not able to enlist in the Army for service in the Army because he was too young. He also did not receive his commission until 1921 which means he never met the criteria for the award of the World War I victory medal. I move that the medal be removed from his awards and decorations unless evidence can be provided that shows he met established criteria.[[User:Dmanrock29|Dmanrock29]] ([[User talk:Dmanrock29|talk]]) 17:52, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
* to be eligible for the WWI Victory Medal all a serviceman had to do was to be in the service as of 1918.  ROTC cadets are enlisted in the respected service Organized Reserve Corps.  So the rules back then &quot;may have allowed&quot; ROTC cadets to be eligible as enlisted in the Army Reserve.  Hey, he also received the CIB but didn't meet the regulatory requirements for it. [[User:Meyerj|Meyerj]] ([[User talk:Meyerj|talk]]) 12:22, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
::While I can't find any information concerning ROTC there's never been ambiguity about general officers receiving the CIB. GoA Omar Bradley personally intervened when one of his subordinates tried having himself awarded it. Unless Dean fought in combat before he became a general he was not eligiable for the CIB. I would definitely move that that be removed.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Dmanrock29|Dmanrock29]] ([[User talk:Dmanrock29|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dmanrock29|contribs]]) 15:08, 19 May 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:::Don't waste your time.  Major General Dean is one of three general officers who have been given the CIB for service while a General Officer, with General Joseph Stilwell and General Ridgway.  Somebody presented these guys with the badge, again against the regulation, It 'may' be on their DD214.  But it couldn't have been 'awarded', it had to be given.  Also in Dean's case he was presumed dead in Korea and so MacArthur put him in for the MOH.  What were they going to do when he turned up captured? Take it back?
