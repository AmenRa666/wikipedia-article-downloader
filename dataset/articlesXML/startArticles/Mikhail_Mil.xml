'''Mikhail Leontyevich Mil''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Лео́нтьевич Миль}}; 22 November 1909&amp;nbsp;– 31 January 1970) was a Soviet [[aerospace engineer]]. He founded the [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant]], which is responsible for many well-known Soviet [[helicopter]] models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monino.ru/ Central Museum of the Military Air Forces of the Russian Federation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mil was born in [[Irkutsk]]. His father was an employee of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], and his mother was a dentist. His grandfather was a [[cantonist]] who had been drafted from [[Libava]] (today [[Liepāja]]), [[Latvia]], and who settled in [[Siberia]] after 25 years in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]].

At age 12, Mil won first prize for a model glider competition. In 1926 he entered the [[Tomsk Polytechnic University|Siberian Technological Institute]] in [[Tomsk]]; however, since there was no curriculum for [[aeronautical engineering]], he transferred in 1928 to the [[Don Polytechnical Institute]] in [[Novocherkassk]], where he was able to specialize in aviation. He married a fellow student, P.G. Rudenko, in 1932 and 4 daughters and a son followed.

After graduating from the Institute in 1931, Mil began his career at [[TsAGI]], too late to work under its original founder, [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky]]. He specialized in the design of [[autogyro]]s, and was an assistant to his future rival, [[Nikolay Kamov]]. With the start of [[World War II]], Mil was drafted into the [[Red Army]] and fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in 1941 near [[Yelnya]]. In 1943 he was called back to continue [[research and development]] in improving the stability and control of combat aircraft. He completed his [[dissertation]]s (&quot;Candidate&quot;, 1943, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], 1945) and in 1947 headed the Helicopter Lab at TsAGI, which was later turned into the Moscow Helicopter Plant.

Mil's creations won many domestic and international awards and set 69 world records. Most notably, the [[Mil Mi-4]] won a Gold Medal in the [[Brussels International Exhibition]] in 1958. In 1971, after his death, his [[Mil Mi-12]] won the [[Sikorsky Prize]] as the most powerful helicopter in the world. Unlike his Soviet counterpart, Nikolai Kamov, Mil enjoyed great prestige due to his single-rotor helicopters, as Kamov used the co-axial rotor layout, which was more controversial.

Mil died in 1970 in Moscow and was buried in Yudinskoe Cemetery in the outskirts of Moscow.
