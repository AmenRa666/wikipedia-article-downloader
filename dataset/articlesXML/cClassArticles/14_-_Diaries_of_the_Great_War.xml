'''''14 - Diaries of the Great War''''' (titled ''Great War Diaries'' when aired on the [[BBC]]) is a 2014 international documentary drama series about [[World War I]]. It uses a mix of acted scenes, archive footage, and animation. All episodes were directed by [[Jan Peter]], series authors were Jan Peter and [[Yury Winterberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presseportal.de/pm/6694/2470168/-14-tagebuecher-des-ersten-weltkriegs-drehstart-zu-einzigartigem-filmprojekt-am-13-mai-im-elsass|title=Drehstart zu einzigartigem Filmprojekt am 13. Mai im Elsass|publisher=Pressemitteilung vom|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a dramatic advisory capacity, Dutch producer and screenwriter [[Maarten van der Duin]] and BBC-author [[Andrew Bampfield]] worked on the film's development. The series is based on an idea by [[Gunnar Dedio]], producer at the film company LOOKS Leipzig and Ulrike Dotzer, the Head of Department [[ARTE]] at [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]].

== Story ==
The individual episodes of the series tell the story of the First World War, not from the perspective of politicians and the military; but from the perspective of soldiers, housewives, factory workers, nurses and children. In total there are 14 main characters. Meaningful scenes from their lives are re-enacted and intertwined. The result is not only a political or military history of the First World War, but a story that poignantly captures the feelings and moods of the people.

More than 1,000 journals and collections of letters were examined and 14 moving stories of World War I were selected from this compilation. Overall, the selection of the diaries and subsequent development work took four years.

=== Archive footage ===
The series uses cinematic and photographic archive material from a total of 71 archives in 21 countries. Most material came from British [[Pathé]] (United Kingdom), [[Pathé|Gaumont Pathé]] (France), Krasnogorsk (Russia), [[Filmarchiv des Bundesarchivs|Bundesfilmarchiv]] (Germany),  Österreichisches Filmmuseum, the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (USA) and the [[Imperial War Museum]].

| ShortSummary    = In the records of the young Cossack Marina Yurlova, the Austrian farmer Karl Kasser and the children Yves Congar and Elfriede Kuhr, who are experiencing the outbreak of war at home, there is little room for jubilant patriotism. The episode describes how everyday life collapsed with the beginning of the war, together with the inflammatory speeches of a teacher and the heroic portrayals of the first days of the war.

A milestone for European television.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lorenz | last=Jäger | title=Weltkriegsgedenken auf Arte - Jede Szene findet eine Parallele beim Feind | work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung | url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/weltkriegsgedenken-auf-arte-jede-szene-findet-eine-parallele-beim-feind-12914544.html | date=29 April 2014 | accessdate=30 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] describes the series as &quot;A story of the destruction and the future of television.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Claudia | last=Tieschky | title=Requiem | work=Süddeutsche Zeitung |date=2014-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuttgarter Zeitung]] calls it &quot;Woven together like a modern television series.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ulla | last=Hanselmann | title=Mit emotionaler Wucht in die Vergangenheit |work=Stuttgarter Zeitung | date=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] says that &quot;the program manages to fascinate by combining different observations, in different locations, and managing to condense these into a coherent mood.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Claudia | last=Schwartz | title=Sag zum Abschied nicht Adieu | work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |date=2014-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Le Monde]] ascribes to the series &quot;a never before seen virtuosity&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Philippe-Jean | last=Catinchi | title=Correspondances de guerre | work=Le Monde | date=27 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Direct Matin calls it &quot;of exceptional quality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=La guerre de l'intérieur | work=Direct Matin | date=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch version of the series was described as follows by [[NRC Handelsblad]]: &quot;Phantastic Television Making… We ride a rollercoaster of emotions, as if we are not supposed to understand history but rather to live it ourselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Hans | last=Beerekamp | title=Beleef de Grote Oorlog met Marina en Käthe | work=NRC Handelsblad | date=14 April 2014 | url=http://www.nrc.nl/handelsblad/van/2014/april/14/beleef-de-grote-oorlog-met-marina-en-kathe-1367467 | accessdate=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After watching the series on [[Netflix]], [[William F.B. O'Reilly]] called the series &quot;superbly done&quot; and said &quot;unlike other Netflix programming that escapes the mind moments after consumption, &quot;14&quot; lingers. It consumes its viewers rather than the other way around.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=William | last=O'Reilly | title=War-weary Europe is putty to Putin | publisher=[[Newsday]] | url=http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/william-f-b-o-reilly/war-weary-europe-is-putty-to-putin-william-f-b-o-reilly-1.9935420 | date=13 February 2015 | accessdate=26 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
