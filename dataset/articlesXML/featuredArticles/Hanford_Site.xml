The [[N Reactor]] is in the foreground, with the twin KE and KW Reactors in the immediate background.

The '''Hanford Site''' is a mostly decommissioned [[Nuclear technology|nuclear]] production complex operated by the United States federal government on the [[Columbia River]] in the U.S. state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The site has been known by many names, including: '''Hanford Project''', '''Hanford Works''', '''Hanford Engineer Works''' and '''Hanford Nuclear Reservation'''. Established in 1943 as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] in  [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]], south-central Washington, the site was home to the [[B Reactor]], the first full-scale [[plutonium]] production [[Nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |title=B Reactor |url=http://www.energy.gov/about/breactor.htm |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202080017/http://www.energy.gov/about/breactor.htm |archivedate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]], tested at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity site]], and in [[Fat Man]], the bomb [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|detonated]] over [[Nagasaki]], Japan.

During the [[Cold War]], the project expanded to include nine nuclear reactors and five large [[Nuclear reprocessing|plutonium processing]] complexes, which produced plutonium for most of the more than 60,000&amp;nbsp;weapons in the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear arsenal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |title=Hanford Site: Hanford Overview |url=http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/HanfordOverview |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68BrRtsd7 |archivedate=June 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsenal&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Science Watch: Growing Nuclear Arsenal |work=The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD71F38F93BA15757C0A961948260 |date=April 28, 1987 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear technology]] developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements. Many early safety procedures and waste disposal practices were inadequate, and government documents have confirmed that Hanford's operations released significant amounts of [[radioactive contamination|radioactive materials]] into the air and the Columbia River.

The weapons production reactors were decommissioned at the end of the Cold War, and decades of manufacturing left behind {{convert|53|e6USgal|m3}} of [[high level waste|high-level radioactive waste]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Washington Department of Ecology]] |title=Hanford Quick Facts |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/features/hanford/hanfordfacts.html |accessdate=January 19, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624232748/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/features/hanford/hanfordfacts.html |archivedate=June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; stored within 177 storage tanks, an additional {{convert|25|e6cuft|m3}} of solid radioactive waste, and {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}} of contaminated groundwater beneath the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;psr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psr.org/chapters/washington/hanford/hanford-facts.html |title=Hanford Facts |publisher=psr.org |accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, DOE emptied 149 single-shell tanks by pumping nearly all of the liquid waste out into 28 newer double-shell tanks. DOE later found water intruding into at least 14 single-shell tanks and that one of them had been leaking about {{convert|640|USgal}} per year into the ground since about 2010. In 2012, DOE discovered a leak also from a double-shell tank caused by construction flaws and corrosion in the bottom, and that 12 double-shell tanks have similar construction flaws. Since then, DOE changed to monitoring single-shell tanks monthly and double-shell tanks every 3 years, and also changed monitoring methods. In March 2014, DOE announced further delays in the construction of the Waste Treatment Plant, which will affect the schedule for removing waste from the tanks.&lt;ref name=GAO1114&gt;{{cite web |author1=GAO |title=Condition of Tanks May Further Limit DOE's Ability to Respond to Leaks and Intrusions- Highlights |url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-40 |publisher=U.S. GAO |accessdate=December 22, 2014 |date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[Image:Hanford Reach National Monument.png|thumb|right|A map shows the main areas of the Hanford Site, as well as the buffer zone that was turned over to the [[Hanford Reach National Monument]] in 2000]]

The Hanford Site occupies {{convert|586|sqmi|km2|0}}—roughly equivalent to half of the total area of [[Rhode Island]]—within [[Benton County, Washington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Overview&quot;/&gt; This land is closed to the general public. It is a [[desert]] environment receiving under 10 inches of annual precipitation, covered mostly by [[shrub-steppe]] vegetation. The [[Columbia river|Columbia River]] flows along the site for approximately {{convert|50|mi|km|-1}}, forming its northern and eastern boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Columbia River at Risk: Why Hanford Cleanup is Vital to Oregon |url=http://www.oregon.gov/ENERGY/NUCSAF/HCleanup.shtml |publisher=oregon.gov |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602110418/http://www.oregon.gov/ENERGY/NUCSAF/HCleanup.shtml |archivedate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original site was {{convert|670|sqmi|km2|-1}} and included buffer areas across the river in [[Grant County, Washington|Grant]] and [[Franklin County, Washington|Franklin]] counties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy 2002 1.12&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.12|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this land has been returned to private use and is now covered with orchards and irrigated fields.

The nuclear reactors were located along the river in an area designated as the 100&amp;nbsp;Area; the chemical separations complexes were located inland in the Central Plateau, designated as the 200&amp;nbsp;Area; and various support facilities were located in the southeast corner of the site, designated as the [[300 Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Columbia Riverkeepers |title=Site Map Area and Description |url=http://www.columbiariverkeeper.org/sitemap.htm |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208132114/http://www.columbiariverkeeper.org/sitemap.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is bordered on the southeast by the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]], a metropolitan area composed of [[Richland, Washington|Richland]], [[Kennewick, Washington|Kennewick]], [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]], and smaller communities, and home to over 230,000&amp;nbsp;residents.

== Early history ==
The confluence of the [[Yakima River|Yakima]], [[Snake River|Snake]], and Columbia rivers has been a meeting place for [[Indigenous peoples|native peoples]] for centuries. The archaeological record of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] habitation of this area stretches back over ten thousand years. Tribes and nations including the [[Yakama]], [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]], and [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]] used the area for hunting, fishing, and gathering plant foods.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryLink&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Hanford Reach National Monument |work=HistoryLink.org: The Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=7438 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanford [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] have identified numerous Native American sites, including &quot;pit house villages, open campsites, fishing sites, hunting/kill sites, [[game drive complex]]es, quarries, and spirit quest sites&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy 2002 1.12&quot;/&gt; and two archaeological sites were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris1&quot;&gt;Hanford Island Archaeological Site (NRHP #76001870) and Hanford North Archaeological District (NHRP #76001871). {{NRISref|2007a}} (See also the commercial site [http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/wa/Benton/state.html National Register of Historic Places].)&lt;/ref&gt; Native American use of the area continued into the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, even as the tribes were relocated to [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. The [[Wanapum]] people were never forced onto a reservation, and they lived along the Columbia River in the [[Priest Rapids|Priest Rapids Valley]] until 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy 2002 1.12&quot;/&gt; Euro-Americans began to settle the region in the 1860s, initially along the Columbia River south of Priest Rapids. They established farms and orchards supported by small-scale irrigation projects and railroad transportation, with small town centers at [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]], [[White Bluffs, Washington|White Bluffs]], and [[Richland, Washington|Richland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerber |first=Michele |title=On the Home Front: The Cold War Legacy of the Hanford Nuclear Site |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |location=Lincoln, NE |edition=2nd |isbn=0-8032-7101-8 |pages=16–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manhattan Project ==
{{Main article|Manhattan Project}}
During [[World War II]], the [[S-1 Section]] of the federal [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD) sponsored an intensive research project on plutonium. The research contract was awarded to scientists at the [[University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory]] (Met Lab). At the time, plutonium was a rare element that had only recently been isolated in a [[University of California]] laboratory. The Met Lab researchers worked on producing chain-reacting &quot;piles&quot; of [[uranium]] to convert it to plutonium and finding ways to separate plutonium from uranium. The program was accelerated in 1942, as the United States government became concerned that scientists in [[Nazi Germany]] were developing a nuclear weapons program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.10|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1942, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] placed the newly formed Manhattan Project under the command of [[Leslie Groves|General Leslie R. Groves]], charging him with the construction of industrial-size plants for manufacturing plutonium and uranium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy 2002 1.12&quot;/&gt; Groves recruited the [[DuPont|DuPont Company]] to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont recommended that it be located far away from the existing uranium production facility at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. The ideal site was described by these criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerber |first=Michele |title=Legend and Legacy: Fifty Years of Defense Production at the Hanford Site |publisher=Westinghouse Hanford Company |year=1992 |location=Richland, Washington |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A large and remote tract of land
* A &quot;hazardous manufacturing area&quot; of at least {{convert|12|by|16|mi|km|0}}
* Space for laboratory facilities at least {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} from the nearest reactor or separations plant
* No towns of more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;people closer than {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} from the hazardous rectangle
* No main highway, railway, or employee village closer than {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} from the hazardous rectangle
* A clean and abundant water supply
* A large electric power supply
* Ground that could bear heavy loads.

In December 1942, Groves dispatched his assistant [[Franklin Matthias|Colonel Franklin T. Matthias]] and DuPont engineers to scout potential sites. Matthias reported that Hanford was &quot;ideal in virtually all respects,&quot; except for the farming towns of [[White Bluffs, Washington|White Bluffs]] and [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Matthias |last=Franklin |title=Hanford Engineer Works, Manhattan Engineer District: Early History |work=Speech to the Technical Exchange Program |date=January 14, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Groves visited the site in January and established the Hanford Engineer Works, codenamed &quot;Site&amp;nbsp;W&quot;. The federal government quickly acquired the land under its war powers authority&lt;ref&gt;Second War Powers Act 56 Stat. 176 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; and relocated some 1,500&amp;nbsp;residents of Hanford, White Bluffs, and nearby settlements, as well as the Wanapum people, Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Nez Perce Tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Department of Energy: Hanford |title=Department of Energy's Tribal Program: The DOE Tribal Program at Hanford |url=http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/inp |publisher=DOE Hanford.gov |accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Kate |title=Plutopia : nuclear families, atomic cities, and the great Soviet and American plutonium disasters |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-985576-6 |pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hanford Engineer Works (HEW) broke ground in March 1943 and immediately launched a massive and technically challenging construction project.&lt;ref name=HistoryLink2&gt;{{cite web |last=Oldham |first=Kit |title=Construction of massive plutonium production complex at Hanford begins in March 1943 |work=History Link |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5363 |date=March 5, 2003 |accessdate=April 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont advertised for workers in newspapers for an unspecified &quot;war construction project&quot; in southeastern Washington, offering &quot;attractive scale of wages&quot; and living facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;milwaukeesentinel&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UEMxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LQ4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7157%2C1687590 |title=Needed by E.

The construction workers (who reached a peak of 44,900 in June 1944) lived in a construction camp near the old Hanford townsite. The administrators and engineers lived in the government town established at Richland Village, which eventually had accommodation in 4,300 family units and 25 dormitories.

Construction of the nuclear facilities proceeded rapidly. Before the end of the war in August 1945, the HEW built 554&amp;nbsp;buildings at Hanford, including three nuclear reactors (105-B, 105-D, and 105-F) and three plutonium processing canyons (221-T, 221-B, and 221-U), each {{convert|250|m|ft|0|sp=us}} long.

To receive the radioactive wastes from the chemical separations process, the HEW built &quot;tank farms&quot; consisting of 64&amp;nbsp;single-shell underground waste tanks (241-B, 241-C, 241-T, and 241-U).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.21–1.23|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project required {{convert|386|mi|km|0}} of roads, {{convert|158|mi|km|0}} of railway, and four electrical substations.

=== Plutonium production ===
{{further|B Reactor}}
The B Reactor (105-B) at Hanford was the first large-scale plutonium production reactor in the world. It was designed and built by DuPont based on an experimental design by [[Enrico Fermi]], and originally operated at 250&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Electrical and thermal watts|megawatts (thermal)]]. The reactor was [[graphite]] moderated and water cooled. It consisted of a {{convert|28|by|36|ft|sp=us|adj=on}}, {{convert|1200|ST|t|adj=on}} graphite cylinder lying on its side, penetrated through its entire length horizontally by 2,004&amp;nbsp;aluminium tubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;page115130&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.15, 1.30|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|Two hundred short tons}} (180&amp;nbsp;t) of uranium slugs, {{convert|1.625|in|cm}} diameter by {{convert|8|in|cm}} long, sealed in aluminium cans went into the tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harvey |first1=David |last2=O'Conner |first2=Georganne |title=History of the Hanford Site 1943–1990 |url=http://ecology.pnnl.gov/library/History/Hanford-History-All.pdf |publisher=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cooling water]] was pumped through the aluminium tubes around the uranium slugs at the rate of {{convert|30,000|USgal|L}} per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;page115130&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Hanford B Reactor.jpg|thumb|left|The B Reactor during construction]]
Construction on B Reactor began in August 1943 and was completed on September 13, 1944. The reactor went [[critical mass|critical]] in late September and, after overcoming [[nuclear poison]]ing, produced its first plutonium on November 6, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.22–1.27|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium was produced in the Hanford reactors when a [[uranium-238]] atom in a fuel slug absorbed a [[neutron]] to form [[uranium-239]]. U-239 rapidly undergoes [[beta decay]] to form [[neptunium-239]], which rapidly undergoes a second beta decay to form [[plutonium-239]]. The irradiated fuel slugs were transported by rail to three huge remotely operated chemical separation plants called &quot;canyons&quot; that were about {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} away. A series of chemical processing steps separated the small amount of plutonium that was produced from the remaining uranium and the fission waste products. This first batch of plutonium was refined in the 221-T plant from December 26, 1944, to February 2, 1945, and delivered to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] on February 5, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Findlay |first=John |author2=Bruce Hevly |title=Nuclear Technologies and Nuclear Communities: A History of Hanford and the Tri-Cities, 1943–1993 |publisher=Hanford History Project, Center for the Study of the Pacific Northwest, University of Washington |place=Seattle, WA |year=1995 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two identical reactors, D Reactor and F reactor, came online in December 1944 and February 1945, respectively. By April 1945, shipments of plutonium were headed to Los Alamos every five days, and Hanford soon provided enough material for the bombs tested at [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] and dropped over [[Fat Man|Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.27|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, the Manhattan Project maintained a top secret classification. Until news arrived of the bomb dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]], fewer than one percent of Hanford's workers knew they were working on a nuclear weapons project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.22|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Groves noted in his memoirs that &quot;We made certain that each member of the project thoroughly understood his part in the total effort; that, and nothing more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Groves |first=Leslie |title=Now It Can Be Told: The Story of the Manhattan Project |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1983 |location=New York, NY |page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially six reactors or &quot;piles&quot; were proposed, when the plutonium was to be used in the gun-type [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]] bomb. In mid-1944 a simple gun-type bomb was found to be impractical for plutonium, and the more advanced [[Fat Man]] bomb required less plutonium. The number of piles was reduced to four and then three; and the number of chemical separation plants from four to three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nichols |first1=Kenneth |year=1987 |title=The Road to Trinity |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |isbn=0-688-06910-X |ref=harv}} p136&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technological innovations ===
In the short time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford engineers produced many significant technological advances. As no one had ever built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, [[DuPont]] engineers installed [[ammonia]]-based [[refrigeration]] systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanger |first=S. L. |title=Working on the Bomb: an Oral History of WWII Hanford |publisher=Continuing Education Press, Portland State University |place=Portland, Oregon |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difficulty the engineers struggled with was how to deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], used as a gasket material, and [[closed-circuit television]], used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanger |first=S.

== Cold War expansion ==
[[Image:Hanford D Reactor.jpg|thumb|right|Decommissioning D Reactor]]

In September 1946, the [[General Electric|General Electric Company]] assumed management of the Hanford Works under the supervision of the newly created [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]. As the Cold War began, the United States faced a new strategic threat in the rise of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project|Soviet nuclear weapons program]]. In August 1947, the Hanford Works announced funding for the construction of two new weapons reactors and research leading to the development of a new chemical separations process. With this announcement, Hanford entered a new phase of expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy |title=Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943–1990 |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2002 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-133-7 |page=1.42–45|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/807939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1963, the Hanford Site was home to nine nuclear reactors along the Columbia River, five reprocessing plants on the central plateau, and more than 900 support buildings and radiological laboratories around the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overview&quot;/&gt; Extensive modifications and upgrades were made to the original three World War II reactors, and a total of 177&amp;nbsp;underground waste tanks were built.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overview&quot;/&gt; Hanford was at its peak production from 1956 to 1965. Over the entire 40 years of operations, the site produced about {{convert|63|ST|MT|0}} of plutonium, supplying the majority of the 60,000&amp;nbsp;weapons in the U.S. arsenal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsenal&quot;/&gt; [[Uranium-233]] was also produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;hanfordchallenge&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanfordchallenge.org/cmsAdmin/uploads/Historical_use_of_thorium_at_Hanford.pdf |title=Historical use of thorium at Hanford |publisher=hanfordchallenge.org |accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hanfordchallenge2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanfordchallenge.org/cmsAdmin/uploads/Chronology_of_thorium_to_U-233_FOIA_Docs.pdf |title=Chronology of Important FOIA Documents: Hanford's Semi-Secret Thorium to U-233 Production Campaign |publisher=hanfordchallenge.org |accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;radioactivist&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioactivist.org/Q%20&amp;%20A%20from%20GAP.pdf |title=Questions and Answers on Uranium-233 at Hanford |publisher=radioactivist.org |accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clarku&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clarku.edu/mtafund/prodlib/gap/round1/2001-12-19.pdf |title=Hanford Radioactivity in Salmon Spawning Grounds |publisher=clarku.edu |accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decommissioning ===
Most of the reactors were shut down between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, [[N Reactor]], continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the [[Washington Public Power Supply System]] (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed (&quot;cocooned&quot;) to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=City of Richland |title=Cocooning Hanford Reactors |date=December 2, 2003 |url=http://www.ci.richland.wa.us/richland/hanford/index.cfm?PageNum=12 |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611213440/http://www.ci.richland.wa.us/richland/hanford/index.cfm?PageNum=12 |archivedate=June 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours.

== Later operations ==
[[Image:Hanford Site sign.jpg|thumb|right|Highway sign on a road entering the Hanford Site]]

The [[United States Department of Energy]] assumed control of the Hanford Site in 1977. Although uranium enrichment and plutonium breeding were slowly phased out, the nuclear legacy left an indelible mark on the Tri-Cities. Since World War&amp;nbsp;II, the area had developed from a small farming community to a booming &quot;Atomic Frontier&quot; to a powerhouse of the nuclear-industrial complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hevly |first=Bruce |author2=John Findlay |title=The Atomic West |publisher=University of Washington Press |year=1998 |location=Seattle, WA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades of federal investment created a community of highly skilled scientists and engineers. As a result of this concentration of specialized skills, the Hanford Site was able to diversify its operations to include scientific research, test facilities, and commercial nuclear power production.

{{as of|2013}}, operational facilities located at the Hanford Site include:

The Department of Energy and its contractors offer tours of the site. Sixty public tours, each five hours long, were planned for 2009.

== Environmental concerns ==
[[Image:Hare HanfordReach.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hanford Reach]] of the [[Columbia River]], where radioactivity was released from 1944 to 1971]]

A huge volume of water from the Columbia River was required to dissipate the heat produced by Hanford's nuclear reactors. From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before its release into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as [[retention basin]]s for up to six hours. Longer-lived [[isotope]]s were not affected by this retention, and several [[becquerel|terabecquerels]] entered the river every day. The federal government kept knowledge about these radioactive releases secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHIN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Hanford Health Information Network |title=An Overview of Hanford and Radiation Health Effects |url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/overview/overview.html |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106001013/http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/overview/overview.html |archivedate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation was later measured 200 miles downstream as far west as the Washington and [[Oregon]] coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Radiation Flowed 200 Miles to Sea, Study Finds |work=The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D8173FF934A25754C0A964958260 |date=July 17, 1992 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plutonium separation process resulted in the release of radioactive isotopes into the air, which were carried by the wind throughout southeastern Washington and into parts of [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], and [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HHIN&quot;/&gt; [[Downwinders]] were exposed to [[radionuclides]], particularly [[iodine-131]], with the heaviest releases during the period from 1945 to 1951. These radionuclides entered the food chain via [[dairy cows]] grazing on contaminated fields; hazardous fallout was ingested by communities who consumed radioactive food and milk. Most of these airborne releases were a part of Hanford's routine operations, while a few of the larger releases occurred in isolated incidents. In 1949, an intentional release known as the &quot;[[Green Run]]&quot; released 8,000&amp;nbsp;curies of iodine-131 over two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerber |first=Michele |title=On the Home Front: The Cold War Legacy of the Hanford Nuclear Site |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |location=Lincoln, NE |edition=2nd |isbn=0-8032-7101-8 |pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of contaminated food came from Columbia River fish, an impact felt disproportionately by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] communities who depended on the river for their customary diets.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHIN&quot;/&gt; A U.S. government report released in 1992 estimated that 685,000 curies of radioactive iodine-131 had been released into the river and air from the Hanford site between 1944 and 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/13/nation/na-hanford13 |author=Martin, Hugo |title=Nuclear site now a tourist hot spot |publisher=The Los Angeles Times |date=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, scientists with the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]] published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, and there were protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to an article in the Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000&amp;nbsp;pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHIN&quot;/&gt; The [[Washington State Department of Health]] collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHIN&quot;/&gt; A [[mass tort]] lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downwinders.com/ Hanford Downwinders Litigation Website].

On February 15, 2013, Governor [[Jay Inslee]] announced that a tank storing [[radioactive waste]] at the site had been leaking liquids on average of 150 to 300 gallons per year.

Historically single shell tanks were used for storing radioactive liquid waste and designed to last 20 years. By 2005, some liquid waste was transferred from single shell tanks to (safer) double shell tanks. A substantial amount of residue remains in the older single shell tanks with one containing an estimated 447,000 gallons of radioactive sludge, for example. It is believed that up to six of these &quot;empty&quot; tanks are leaking. Two tanks are reportedly leaking at a rate of 300 gallons (1,136 liters) per year each, while the remaining four tanks are leaking at a rate of 15 gallons (57 liters) per year each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363719/gov-6-underground-hanford-nuclear-tanks-leaking |title=Gov: 6 underground Hanford nuclear tanks leaking &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=March 23, 2004 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Eric |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/23/us-usa-nuclear-leak-idUSBRE91L19G20130223 |title=Radioactive waste leaking from six tanks at Washington state nuclear site |publisher=Reuters |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, radioactive materials are known to be leaking from Hanford into the environment. &quot;The highest tritium concentration detected in riverbank springs during 2002 was 58,000 pCi/L (2,100 Bq/L) at the Hanford Townsite. The highest iodine-129 concentration of 0.19 pCi/L (0.007 Bq/L) was also found in a Hanford Townsite spring. The WHO guidelines for radionuclides in drinking-water limits levels of iodine-129 at 1 Bq/L, and tritium at 10,000 Bq/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiological Aspects (water sanitation) |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/GDW9rev1and2.pdf |website=www.who.int |publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of radionuclides including tritium, technetium-99, and iodine-129 in riverbank springs near the Hanford Townsite have generally been increasing since 1994.

=== Occupational health concerns ===
Since 1987, workers have reported exposure to harmful vapors after working around underground nuclear storage tanks, with no solution found. More than 40 workers in 2014 alone reported smelling vapors and became ill with &quot;nosebleeds, headaches, watery eyes, burning skin, contact dermatitis, increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, coughing, sore throats, expectorating, dizziness and nausea,&amp;nbsp;... Several of these workers have long-term disabilities.&quot; Doctors checked workers and cleared them to return to work. Monitors worn by tank workers have found no samples with chemicals close to the federal limit for occupational exposure.&lt;ref name=Katu&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.katu.com/news/local/Washington-to-sue-over-nuclear-sites-tank-vapors--283276831.html |title=Washington to sue over nuclear site's tank vapors |author=Nicholas K. Geranios |publisher=Associated Press |work=Katu.com |date=November 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] ordered the facility to rehire a contractor and pay $220,000 in back wages for firing them for [[whistleblowing]] on safety concerns at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&amp;p_id=26571 |title=OSHA orders Hanford nuclear facility contractor to reinstate worker fired for raising environmental safety concerns |publisher=OSHA |date=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2014, [[Washington Attorney General]] Bob Ferguson said the state planned to sue the DOE and its contractor to protect workers from hazardous vapors at Hanford. A 2014 report by the DOE [[Savannah River National Laboratory]] initiated by 'Washington River Protection Solutions' found that DOE's methods to study vapor releases were inadequate, particularly, that they did not account for short but intense vapor releases. They recommended &quot;proactively sampling the air inside tanks to determine its chemical makeup; accelerating new practices to prevent worker exposures; and modifying medical evaluations to reflect how workers are exposed to vapors&quot;.&lt;ref name=Katu/&gt;

While major releases of radioactive material ended with the reactor shutdown in the 1970s and many of the most dangerous wastes are contained, there are continued concerns about contaminated groundwater headed toward the Columbia River and about workers' health and safety.&lt;ref name=Troubled/&gt;

The most significant challenge at Hanford is stabilizing the {{convert|53,000,000|USgal}} of high-level radioactive waste stored in 177&amp;nbsp;underground tanks.

Under the Tri-Party Agreement, lower-level hazardous wastes are buried in huge lined pits that will be sealed and monitored with sophisticated instruments for many years. Disposal of plutonium and other high-level wastes is a more difficult problem that continues to be a subject of intense debate. As an example, plutonium-239 has a [[half-life]] of 24,100 years, and a decay of ten half-lives is required before a sample is considered to cease its radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Laura A. |last=Hanson |publisher=University of Idaho |title=Radioactive Waste Contamination of Soil and Groundwater at the Hanford Site |date=November 2000 |url=http://www.agls.uidaho.edu/etox/resources/case_studies/HANFORD.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gephart |first=Roy |title=Hanford: A Conversation About Nuclear Waste and Cleanup |publisher=Battelle Press |year=2003 |location=Columbus, OH |isbn=1-57477-134-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Department of Energy awarded a $4.3 billion contract to [[Bechtel]], a San Francisco-based construction and engineering firm, to build a [[Radioactive waste#Vitrification|vitrification]] plant to combine the dangerous wastes with glass to render them stable.

In May 2007, state and federal officials began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as [[groundwater remediation]]. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600&amp;nbsp;million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws.&lt;ref name=Troubled/&gt; They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/environment/archives/135723.asp |title=State steps back from brink of Hanford suit |last=Stiffler |first=Lisa |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During excavations from 2004 to 2007 a sample of purified plutonium was uncovered inside a safe in a waste trench, and has been dated to about the 1940s, making it the second-oldest sample of purified plutonium known to exist. Analyses published in 2009 concluded that the sample originated at Oak Ridge, and was one of several sent to Hanford for optimization tests of the T-Plant until Hanford could produce its own plutonium. Documents refer to such a sample, belonging to &quot;Watt's group&quot;, which was disposed of in its safe when a radiation leak was suspected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/87/i05/8705notw7.html Chemical &amp; Engineering News: Antique Plutonium: Manhattan Project-era plutonium is found in a glass jug during Hanford Site cleanup]{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Historic-plutonium-found-in-safe-at-Hanford-1298348.php |publisher=Seattle Pi |work=TRI-CITY HERALD |author=Annette Cary |title=Historic plutonium found in safe at Hanford |date=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the radioactive waste at Hanford was supposed to be stored in the planned [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]], but after that project was cancelled due to the opposition of citizens of Nevada, Washington State sued. They were joined by South Carolina. Their first suit was dismissed, and second suits have been filed.

A potential radioactive leak was reported in 2013; the clean up was estimated to have cost $40&amp;nbsp;billion with $115&amp;nbsp;billion more required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57590463/possible-radioactive-leak-into-soil-at-hanford/ |title=Possible radioactive leak into soil at Hanford |work=CBS News |date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
