The '''''Volage'' class ''' was a group of two [[screw corvette]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the late 1860s. Both ships spent the bulk of their active service abroad. ''Volage'' spent most of her first commission assigned to the Detached or Flying Squadron circumnavigating the world and then carried a party of astronomers to the [[Kerguelen Islands]] to observe the [[Transit of Venus]] in 1874. The ship was then assigned as the senior officer's ship in South American waters until she was transferred to the Training Squadron during the 1880s.

''Active'' served as the commodore's ship on the [[South Atlantic Station|Cape of Good Hope and West Africa Station]] and her crew served ashore in both the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars|Third Anglo-Ashanti]] and [[Anglo-Zulu War|Zulu Wars]]. She was assigned to the Training Squadron in 1885 after a period in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. The [[sister ship|sisters]] were [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1898–99 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1904 and 1906, respectively. 

==Design and description==
Sir [[Edward James Reed|Edward Reed]], the [[Director of Naval Construction]], was tasked to provide a combination of seaworthiness and speed for these ships. He gave the ships a high length-to-[[Beam (nautical)|beam]] ratio to increase their speed, but this made the design less manoeuvrable. To offset this, the ends of the ships were narrowed to allow the [[rudder]] as much authority as possible even though this reduced buoyancy at the ends of the ship and caused the weights to be concentrated in the middle of the ship. The compromise proved to be successful and the design did not have a large turning circle. [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[George Alexander Ballard|G. A. Ballard]] considered them to be &quot;a definite step forward in the shipbuilder's art.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; Ballard considered their only real defect to be unsteadiness as gun platforms as their [[metacentric height]] was fairly high, which caused them to roll excessively, and they pitched quite a bit in a [[head sea]] due to the lack of buoyancy in the narrow bow. [[Bilge keel]]s were later installed during one of their refits to curb their rolling motion.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Volage''-class ships were {{convert|270|ft|m|1}} [[Length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a beam of {{convert|42|ft|1|in|m|1}}. Forward, the ships had a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|16|ft|5|in|m|1}}, but aft they drew {{convert|21|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on|1}}. They displaced {{convert|3078|LT|t}} and had a [[Builder's Old Measurement|burthen]] of 2,322 tons. Their iron hull was covered by a {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} layer of oak that was sheathed with copper from the waterline down to prevent [[biofouling]].&lt;ref name=RW&gt;Lyon &amp; Winfield, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Watertight transverse [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s subdivided the hull.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Their crew consisted of 340 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt;

The ships had one 2-cylinder [[Marine steam engine|steam engine]] driving a single {{convert|19|ft|m|adj=on}} propeller.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt; Five rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of {{convert|30|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=b5&gt;Ballard, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; The engine produced a total of {{convert|4130|-|4530|ihp|lk=in}} which gave them a maximum speed of about {{convert|15|kn|lk=in}}. The ships carried {{convert|410|-|420|LT|t}} of coal, enough to steam {{convert|1850|-|2000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|knots}}.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt;

The class was [[ship rig]]ged and had a sail area of {{convert|16593|sqft|sqm|0}}.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt; The lower masts were made of iron, but the other masts were wood. Their best speed under sail alone was {{convert|12.5|to|13|kn}}. Their [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] was semi-retractable to reduce wind resistance&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; and the propeller could be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt;

The ships were initially armed with a mix of [[RML 7 inch gun|7-inch]] and [[RML 64 pounder 64 cwt gun|64-pounder 64 cwt]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;cwt&quot; is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 64 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading guns]]. The six {{convert|7|in|adj=on|0}} guns and two of the four 64-pounders were mounted on the broadside while the other two were mounted on the [[forecastle]] and [[poop deck]] as [[chase gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; The 16-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] 7-inch gun weighed {{convert|6.5|LT|t}} and fired a {{convert|112|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} shell. It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate {{convert|7.7|in|mm|adj=on|0}} armour.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879–80, ten [[BL 6 inch 80 pounder gun|BL 6-inch 80-pounder]] [[Rifled breech loader|breech-loading guns]] replaced all the broadside weapons.{{#tag:ref|There is some confusion as to the exact model, the Mk I or Mk II, of 6-inch gun carried by these ships. Ballard, Winfield, and Gardiner all say Mk I firing an {{convert|80|lb|adj=on}} shell. Campbell, however, specifically lists these ships as carrying Mk IIs that could fire {{convert|100|lb|adj=on}} shells. He even describes an incident where one of the guns aboard ''Active'' blew up in November 1884. Furthermore, Campbell says that only 19 Mk I guns were built and that they were mounted on two {{sclass|Comus|corvette}}s and then in {{HMS|Rover|1874|6}}. 143 Mk II guns were built and armed the {{sclass|Bacchante|corvette|0}} and ''Comus''-class ships, among others. It seems odd that the Mk I and II weighed nearly the same amount, but the Mk II fired a much heavier shell, according to Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 170–72&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the simplest way to reconcile these problems is that Campbell made a typo when giving the shell weight fired by the Mk II and that both marks fired the same 80-pound shell. The relevant gunnery handbooks need to be consulted to see if Campbell made a mistake or not.|group=Note}} Two carriages for {{convert|14|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedoes]] were also added.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt;

''Volage'' was the first ship to be commissioned and was initially assigned to the Channel Fleet under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Sir [[Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, 3rd Baronet|Michael Culme-Seymour]], [[Baronet|Bt.]] However, by the end of 1870, she was transferred to the Flying Squadron which circumnavigated the world. The ship returned to England at the end of 1872 and was given a lengthy refit. During this time, ''Volage'' was rearmed with eighteen 64-pdr 64 cwt guns. She [[Ship commissioning|recommissioned]] in 1874 to ferry an expedition to the Kerguelen Islands to observe the transit of Venus. The following year, the ship was assigned as the senior officer's ship for the South American side of the South Atlantic. ''Volage'' was ordered home in 1879 where she was refitted, rearmed and her boilers were replaced. The ship was assigned to the Training Squadron in the 1880s where she remained until it was disbanded in 1899. ''Volage'' was then paid off and sold for scrap in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike her [[sister ship]], ''Active'' was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] after completion until 1873 when she was commissioned to serve as the [[flagship]] of the [[Commander-in-Chief]], Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station, [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[William Nathan Wrighte Hewett|William Hewett]]. The ship participated in naval operations during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War of 1874 and some of her crew were landed to reinforce the forces ashore. Commodore [[Sir Francis Sullivan, 6th Baronet|Francis Sullivan]] replaced Hewett in 1876&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Ballard, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; and some of her officers and men participated in the Anglo-Zulu War of 1878–79 as part of the Naval Brigade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette24780&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24780|date=7 November 1879|startpage=6310|endpage=6312|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan remained in command until 1879 when the ship returned home to refit and rearm. ''Active'' was placed in reserve after the completion of her refit until she was selected in 1885 to be the commodore's flagship in the newly formed Training Squadron. The ship was paid off from this assignment in 1898 and sold for scrap in 1906.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;
