==History==
Misha and Sasha were among the architects of the original BLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscentralasia.net/2011/07/18/archive-material-pakistan-unveiling-the-mystery-of-balochistan-insurgency-part-two/|title=[Archive Material] Pakistan: Unveiling the Mystery of Balochistan Insurgency — Part Two|publisher=Newscentralasia.net|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BLA remained active during the Russo-Afghan war and then it disappeared from the surface, mostly because its main source of funding – the Soviet Union – disappeared from the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Kristen P.|title=Despite Nationalist Conflicts: Theory and Practice of Maintaining World Peace|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-275-96934-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|None of this is in the cited source|date=July 2016}}

On 10 February 1973, Pakistani police and paramilitary [[Arms discovery in Iraqi Embassy (Pakistan)|raided the Iraqi embassy in Islamabad]] without prior permission of the Iraqi government, during which a large cache of small arms, ammunition, grenades and other supplies were found in crates marked 'Foreign Ministry, Baghdad'. The ammunition and weaponry was believed to be destined for Baloch rebels. Pakistan responded by expelling and declaring persona non grata the Iraqi Ambassador Hikmat Sulaiman and other consular staff. In a letter to President Nixon on February 14, Bhutto blamed India and Afghanistan, besides Iraq and the Soviet Union, for involvement in a &quot;conspiracy ... [with] subversive and irredentist elements which seek to disrupt Pakistan's integrity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/04032011/page26.shtml|title=The Friday Times:Caught!

Wright-Neville wrote that besides Pakistan, some Western observers also believe that India secretly funds the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Terrorism|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0745643021|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=ZgmXxoLHv8MC&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=David Wright-Neville|edition=1st|accessdate=3 June 2012|pages=48–49|date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2013 US Special Representative James Dobbins said “The dominant infiltration of militants is from Pakistan into Afghanistan, but we recognise that there is some infiltration of hostile militants from the other direction as well.&quot;So Pakistan's concerns aren't groundless. They are simply, in our judgement, somewhat exaggerated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawn.com/news/1034778/us-acknowledges-pakistans-fears-of-indian-presence-in-afghanistan|title=US acknowledges Pakistan’s fears of Indian presence in Afghanistan|author=APP|publisher=Dawn.com|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign involvement==
It has been claimed that Brahumdagh Bugti is one of the founders of the BLA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siddiqi&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Farhan Hanif|title=The Political Economy of Conflict in South Asia|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1137397430|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]] has accused the BLA of being an Indian proxy, and Indian consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad, Afghanistan, for providing arms, training and financial aid to the BLA in an attempt to destabilize Pakistan&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/84902/wikileaks-india-russia-supporting-baloch-insurgency/ MPs told Russia, India and UAE involved in Baloch insurgency – The Express Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?231032 www.outlookindia.com|'RAW Is Training 600 Balochis In Afghanistan']&lt;/ref&gt; However Hyrbyair Marri has denied the group has any links with India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marri&quot;/&gt;

In a Wikileaks cable it was revealed that [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] believed, “India and the UAE (reportedly due to opposition to construction of the Gwadar port) were funding and arming the Baloch. Pasha also claimed that the [[Russia]]n government was directly involved in funding/training/supporting the insurgency&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MPs told Russia, India and UAE involved in Baloch insurgency|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/84902/wikileaks-india-russia-supporting-baloch-insurgency/|date=December 3, 2010|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrorist designation==
Pakistan designated the Balochistan Liberation Army as a terrorist organisation on 7 April 2006 after the group conducted a series of attacks targeting security personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Names of 61 banned outfits in Pakistan, JuD under observation|publisher=Dispatch News Desk|url=http://www.dnd.com.pk/names-of-61-banned-outfits-in-pakistan-jud-under-observation/102863|date=December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July 2006, the British government followed suit, listing the BLA as a &quot;proscribed group&quot; based on the [[Terrorism Act 2000]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article689084.ece |title=Militant Islamist groups banned under terror law|author=Richard Ford|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the U.K. has harboured Hyrbyair Marri, leader of the BLA, as a refugee, something Pakistani leader [[Raheel Sharif]] has strongly protested against.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.com.pk/story/822083/army-chief-in-london-uk-urged-to-act-against-hut-baloch-separatists/ Army chief in London: UK urged to act against HuT, Baloch separatists]&lt;/ref&gt; The group's actions have been described as [[terrorism]] by the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204212453/http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2006/82734.htm|archivedate=2011-02-04|url=http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2006/82734.htm|title=Chapter 2 -- Country Reports: South and Central Asia Overview|publisher=[[Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism]]|date= April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks==
On 14 December 2005, BLA militants launched six rockets at a paramilitary camp in Balochistan's Kohlu district that then-President Pervez Musharraf was visiting. Though Musharraf's life was never in any real danger, the Pakistani government labeled the attack an attempt on his life and initiated a sweeping army operation in Kohlu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=709&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=239&amp;no_cache=1|title=The Baloch Insurgency and its Threat to Pakistan's Energy Sector|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|date=March 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2009, masked gunmen shot dead Anwar Baig, a school teacher in Kalat. Baig had opposed recitation of the Baloch anthem in schools. The killing was part of a larger campaign against educators who were seen to be sympathetic to the Pakistani state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/02/08/testimony-ali-dayan-hasan-us-house-committee-foreign-affairs-regarding-human-rights-|title=Testimony of Ali Dayan Hasan before the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs regarding Human Rights in Balochistan - Human Rights Watch|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2009, BLA militants kidnapped 19 Pakistani police in Sui, killed one and injured 16. Over the course of 3 weeks all but one of the kidnapped police were killed by their captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/IncidentSummary.aspx?gtdid=200907300006|title=Incident Summary for GTDID: 200907300006|publisher=Start.umd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2010, BLA militants killed 6 Punjabi laborers and wounded 3 others while they were on their way home from work. The workers were targeted because they were Punjabi and, according to the BLA, taking part in the economic colonization of Balochistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/IncidentSummary.aspx?gtdid=201008140001|title=Incident Summary for GTDID: 201008140001|publisher=Start.umd.edu|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2011, BLA insurgents attacked government security personnel who were guarding a private coal mine in the northern Musakhel district, killing 14 and wounding 10 more. The BLA claimed to have killed 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan troops killed in ambush in Balochistan|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-15815853|date=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 31 2011, BLA militants placed a car bomb outside the house of Mir Naseer Mengal, a former minister of state, killing 13 and wounding 30 more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BLA claims responsibility of the blast in Quetta: 13 killed|publisher=Dawn|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/684475/bla-claims-responsibility-of-the-blast-in-quetta-13-killed|date=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2015, BLA militants bombed and then shot and killed 16 soldiers, wounding an additional 13 soldiers in two attacks in Marwar and Chamalang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Balochistan: Baloch Liberation Army claimed to have killed 16 Pakistani soldiers|publisher=Balochwarna News|url=http://balochwarna.com/2015/12/23/balochistan-baloch-liberation-army-claimed-to-have-killed-16-pakistani-soldiers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quaid-e-Azam Residency===
{{main article|2013 Quaid-e-Azam Residency attack}}
The [[Quaid-e-Azam Residency]], a historical residence in Balochistan where [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] spent the last days of his life, was attacked by rockets on 15 June 2013. The building was nearly demolished as a result of the attack. Militants belonging to the Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility. The militants also removed the flag of Pakistan from the monument site, replacing it with a BLA flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BLA destroys Jinnah’s Residency in Ziarat|publisher=The Express Tribune|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/563877/bla-destroys-jinnahs-residency-in-ziarat/|date=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction work was completed and the rehabilitated Ziarat Residency opened on August 14, 2014 by Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1106091/rehabilitated-ziarat-residency-to-be-inaugurated-on-august-14th|title=Rehabilitated Ziarat Residency to be inaugurated on August 14th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
