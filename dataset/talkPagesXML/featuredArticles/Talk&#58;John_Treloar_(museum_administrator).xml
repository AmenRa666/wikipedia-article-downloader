== Comments ==
Some comments as I look at the article, which by the way is a fascinating read:

*The lede needs expanding a bit, maybe another paragraph or so.
*'His parents' backgrounds differed considerably; his father was a sales representative for the Carlton &amp; United Breweries  while his mother was a strict Methodist' - This seems a tad incongruous to me; I know that Methodists don't like their drink, but saying their backgrounds differed considerably with this information doesn't seem quite right. If the father had been a Catholic, or the mother had been a Temperance worker, then maybe, but the differences don't seem that great. Maybe just get rid of the 'Backgrounds differed considerably' bit?
*'When he recovered his health Treloar attempted to return to Brudenell White's staff. This was not successful, however, and he instead joined the Australian Flying Corps as an officer' - Do we know why not?
*'Treloar's first challenge was to improve the quality of the AIF's war diaries, which at the time were &quot;kept very badly&quot;.' - Does that last direct quote need a cite, given that it (might) be a tad contentious?
*'He also sought to motivate the relevant personnel by demonstrating that the diaries were valued and would be important in ensuring that their unit received recognition for its achievements after the war' - Any examples of how he demonstrated this?
*'In September 1917 the AWRS expanded its activities to include collecting artefacts from the French battlefields.' - Not the other battlefields in the Middle East as well?
*What was the War Trophies Commission, and his role in it that he needed the increase in rank?
*Last three paras of 'World War I' section are a bit fragmented, recommend merging into several larger paragraphs if possible.
*'On 26 June 1942 he was Mentioned in Despatches for his service in October 1941.' - Why was he mentioned - what did he do to deserve it?
*'As a result, the long-standing relationship between Treloar and Bazley deteriorated, and in 1945 the Memorial's board was forced to make a ruling on their different responsibilities' - Can we have some info on what the decision was, and how their responsibilities were divided?
:Overall, a very good article, and I think it could easily be a Good Article. Pictures and references look good, as does the prose. Let me know if you want me to do that formally in the GAN process. [[User:Skinny87|Skinny87]] ([[User talk:Skinny87|talk]]) 13:28, 23 June 2010 (UTC)

::Nothing in British sources thatI can trace that gives any reason for the Mention in 1942.  They're so low level they are always the hardest to work out.  [[User:David Underdown|David Underdown]] ([[User talk:David Underdown|talk]]) 15:55, 23 June 2010 (UTC)

:::Thank you very much for those comments - I'll work my way though them over the weekend. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 08:12, 24 June 2010 (UTC)

== Teetotalism ==
&quot;While Treloar was a strict [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]] and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.&quot;
This line contains a non-sequitur. He touched alcohol or he didn't.[[User:Lexysexy|Lexysexy]] ([[User talk:Lexysexy|talk]]) 02:06, 10 December 2011 (UTC)

:That's a good point. I've removed the 'strict', as this obviously doesn't seem to have been the case. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 02:18, 10 December 2011 (UTC)</text>
