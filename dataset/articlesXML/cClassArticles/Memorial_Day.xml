'''Memorial Day''' is a [[federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday in the United States]] for remembering the people who died while serving in the [[United States Armed Forces|country's armed forces]].&lt;ref name=vamd&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.va.gov/opa/speceven/memday/ |title=Memorial Day |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday, which is observed every year on the last Monday of May,&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|36|116}}&lt;/ref&gt; originated as '''Decoration Day''' after the [[American Civil War]] in 1868, when the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], an organization of [[Union Army|Union]] veterans founded in [[Decatur, Illinois]], established it as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the Union war dead with flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.va.gov/opa/speceven/memday/history.asp|title=Memorial Day History â€“ Office of Public Affairs|first=Office of Public and Intergovernmental|last=Affairs|work=va.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century, competing [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] holiday traditions, celebrated on different days, had merged, and Memorial Day eventually extended to honor all Americans who died while in the military service.&lt;ref name=vamd /&gt; It marks the start of the unofficial summer vacation season,&lt;ref name=&quot;Yan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yan|first1=Holly|title=Memorial Day 2016: What you need to know|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/26/us/memorial-day-roundup/index.html|website=CNN|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Labor Day]] marks its end.

Many people visit cemeteries and memorials, particularly to honor those who have died in military service. Many volunteers place an American flag on each grave in [[United States national cemetery|national cemeteries]].

Annual Decoration Days for particular cemeteries are held on a Sunday in late spring or early summer in some rural areas of the American South, notably in the mountain areas. In cases involving a family graveyard where remote ancestors as well as those who were deceased more recently are buried, this may take on the character of an extended family reunion to which some people travel hundreds of miles. People gather on the designated day and put flowers on graves and renew contacts with relatives and others. There often is a religious service and a picnic-like &quot;dinner on the grounds,&quot; the traditional term for a [[potluck]] meal at a church. It is believed that this practice began before the American Civil War and thus may reflect the real origin of the &quot;memorial day&quot; idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;JabbourJabbour2010&quot; /&gt;

Memorial Day is not to be confused with [[Veterans Day]]; Memorial Day is a day of remembering the men and women who ''died'' while serving, while Veterans Day celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kickler |first=Sarah |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/parenting/homefront/bal-memorial-day-vs-veterans-day-20120528,0,1402423.story |title=Memorial Day vs. Veterans Day |publisher=baltimoresun.com |date=May 28, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of decorating soldiers' graves with flowers is an ancient custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mary L'Hommedieu Gardiner |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=UwJaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q=%22decorating%20the%20grave%22&amp;f=false |title=The Ladies Garland |page=296 |volume=6 |publisher=J.

E.J., &quot;The Soldier's Grave,&quot; in The Analectic Magazine (1817), Vol. 10, 264.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the [[American Civil War]]. A claim was made in 1906 that the first Civil War soldier's grave ever decorated was in [[Warrenton, Virginia]], on June 3, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2001.05.0293%3Achapter%3D1.73 |title=Times-Dispatch, 1906 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date=July 15, 1906 |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not for Union soldiers, there is authentic documentation that women in [[Savannah, Georgia]], decorated Confederate soldiers' graves in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.uttyler.edu/vbetts/savannah_republican_1862.htm |title=&quot;A Beautiful Tribute,&quot; Savannah Republican, July 21, 1862 |publisher=.uttyler.edu |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, the cemetery dedication at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], was a ceremony of commemoration at the graves of dead soldiers.

Following President [[Abraham Lincoln#Assassination|Abraham Lincoln's assassination]] in April 1865, there were a variety of events of commemoration. The sheer number of soldiers of both sides who died in the Civil War (more than 600,000), meant that burial and memorialization took on new cultural significance. Under the leadership of women during the war, an increasingly formal practice of decorating graves had taken shape. In 1865, the federal government began creating national military cemeteries for the Union war dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;WaughGallagher2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Waugh|author2=Gary W.

A memorial-type observance after the Civil War was in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], on May 1, 1865. [[David W. Blight]] claims that &quot;African Americans invented Memorial Day in Charleston, South Carolina&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-119/lecture-19 |author=Blight, David W. |title=Lecture: To Appomattox and Beyond: The End of the War and a Search for Meanings, Overview |publisher=Oyc.yale.edu |quote=Professor Blight closes his lecture with a description of the first Memorial Day, celebrated by African Americans in Charleston, SC 1865. |accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the accounts of the ''Charleston Daily Courier''. However, Blight stated that he &quot;has no evidence&quot; that this event in Charleston inspired the establishment of Memorial Day across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/us/many-claim-to-be-memorial-day-birthplace.html David Blight, cited by Campbell Robertson, &quot;Birthplace of Memorial Day? That Depends Where You're From,&quot; New York Times, May 28, 2012] â€“ Link is first of two web pages â€“ Blight quote from 2nd web page: &quot;He has called that the first Memorial Day, as it predated most of the other contenders, though he said he has no evidence that it led to General Logan's call for a national holiday.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Union soldiers who were [[prisoners of war]] had been held at the [[Hampton Park (Charleston)|Hampton Park Race Course]] in Charleston; at least 257 Union prisoners died there and were hastily buried in unmarked graves.&lt;ref&gt;Blight, David W. ''Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory'' (2001), ch. 3, &quot;Decoration Days&quot;, pp. 67â€“70&lt;/ref&gt; Together with teachers and missionaries, black residents of Charleston organized a May Day ceremony in 1865, which was covered by the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' and other national papers. The freedmen cleaned up and landscaped the burial ground, building an enclosure and an arch labeled &quot;Martyrs of the Race Course&quot;. Nearly 10,000 people, mostly freedmen, gathered on May 1 to commemorate the war dead. Involved were about 3,000 school children, newly enrolled in freedmen's schools, as well as mutual aid societies, Union troops, black ministers and white northern missionaries. Most brought flowers to lay on the burial field.

On May 26, 1966, President Johnson signed a presidential proclamation naming [[Waterloo (village), New York|Waterloo, New York]] as the birthplace of Memorial Day. Earlier, the 89th Congress had adopted House Concurrent Resolution 587, which officially recognized that the patriotic tradition of observing Memorial Day began one hundred years prior in Waterloo, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Lyndon|title=Presidential Proclamation 3727|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=27618 |accessdate=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other towns also claim that they held the first Memorial Day,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, &quot;Birthplace of Memorial Day? That Depends Where You're From&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; however, a recent study investigating dozens of origin theories concludes that nearly all of them are apocryphal legends.&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/The-Genesis-Memorial-Day-Holiday/dp/069229225X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413657293&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=genesis+of+memorial+day Daniel Bellware and Richard Gardiner, ''The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America'' (Columbus State University, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorial events were held in 183 cemeteries in 27 states in 1868, and 336 in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Blight (2004), pp.99â€“100&lt;/ref&gt; The northern states quickly adopted the holiday. Michigan made &quot;Decoration Day&quot; an official state holiday in 1871 and by 1890, every northern state had followed suit. The ceremonies were sponsored by the [[Women's Relief Corps]], the women's auxiliary of the [[Grand Army of the Republic|Grand Army of the Republic (GAR)]], which had 100,000 members. By 1870, the remains of nearly 300,000 Union dead had been reinterred in 73 national cemeteries, located near major battlefields and thus mainly in the South. The most famous are [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] in Pennsylvania and [[Arlington National Cemetery]], near Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/pdf/IS1_Jan_2011.pdf |format=PDF |title=Interments in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Cemeteries |date=January 2011 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=National Cemetery Administration â€“  Department of Veterans Affairs VA-NCA-IS-1 |quote=After the Civil War, search and recovery teams visited hundreds of battlefields, churchyards, plantations and other locations seeking wartime interments that were made in haste.

Memorial Day speeches became an occasion for veterans, politicians, and ministers to commemorate the War and, at first, to rehash the &quot;atrocities&quot; of the enemy. They mixed religion and celebratory nationalism and provided a means for the people to make sense of their history in terms of sacrifice for a better nation. People of all religious beliefs joined together and the point was often made that the German and Irish soldiers had become true Americans in the &quot;baptism of blood&quot; on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Samito2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Samito|first=Christian G.|title=Becoming American Under Fire: Irish Americans, African Americans, and the Politics of Citizenship During the Civil War Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1kWty_iqrzQC&amp;pg=PA126|accessdate=May 25, 2014|year=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-4846-1|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the South, associations were founded, many by women, to establish and care for permanent cemeteries for the Confederate dead, organize commemorative ceremonies, and sponsor appropriate monuments as a permanent way of remembering the Confederate cause and sacrifice. The most important was the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]], which grew from 17,000 members in 1900 to nearly 100,000 women by [[World War I]]. They were &quot;strikingly successful at raising money to build Confederate monuments, lobbying legislatures and Congress for the reburial of Confederate dead, and working to shape the content of history textbooks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blight (2001), ''Race and Reunion'', pp. 272â€“273&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 1866, women in [[Columbus, Mississippi]] laid flowers on the graves of both the Union and Confederate dead in the city's cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ms/state/didyouknow.htm |title=Did You Know?

By 1890, there was a shift from the emphasis on honoring specific soldiers to a public commemoration of the lost Confederate cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Center(Firm)2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=University of Michigan|author2=EBSCO Publishing (Firm)|title=America, history and life|year=2000|publisher=Clio Press.|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the ceremony's hymns and speeches reflect an evolution of the ritual into a symbol of cultural renewal and conservatism in the South. By 1913, Blight argues, the theme of American nationalism shared equal time with the [[Lost Cause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David W.

The ceremonies and Memorial Day address at [[Gettysburg National Park]] became nationally well known, starting in 1868. In July 1913, veterans of the United States and Confederate armies gathered in Gettysburg to commemorate the fifty-year anniversary of the Civil War's bloodiest and most famous battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeonRosenzweig1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Warren Leon|author2=Roy Rosenzweig|title=History Museums in the United States: A Critical Assessment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-bgd_LsBzEC&amp;pg=PA140|date=June 1, 1989|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06064-9|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-day &quot;Blue-Gray Reunion&quot; featured parades, re-enactments, and speeches from a host of dignitaries, including President [[Woodrow Wilson]], the first Southerner elected to the [[White House]] after the War. [[James Thomas Heflin|James Heflin]] of [[Alabama]] gave the main address. Heflin was a noted orator; two of his best-known speeches were an endorsement of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and his call to make [[Mother's Day]] a holiday. His choice as Memorial Day speaker was criticized, as he was opposed for his support of segregation; however, his speech was moderate in tone and stressed national unity and goodwill, gaining him praise from newspapers.

Since the cemetery dedication at Gettysburg occurred on November 19, that day (or the closest weekend) has been designated as their own local memorial day that is referred to as [[Remembrance Day at the Gettysburg Battlefield|Remembrance Day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LaFantasie2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Glenn W.

== Name and date ==

The preferred name for the holiday gradually changed from &quot;Decoration Day&quot; to &quot;Memorial Day,&quot; which was first used in 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoddardZon2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry Perkins Goddard|author2=Calvin Goddard Zon|title=The Good Fight That Didn't End: Henry P.

The law took effect at the federal level in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Law 90-363&quot; /&gt; After some initial confusion and unwillingness to comply, all 50 states adopted Congress' change of date within a few years.

Memorial Day endures as a holiday which most businesses observe because it marks the unofficial beginning of summer. The [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] (VFW) and [[Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War]] (SUVCW) advocate returning to the original date, although the significance of the date is tenuous. The VFW stated in a 2002 Memorial Day Address:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Changing the date merely to create three-day weekends has undermined the very meaning of the day. No doubt, this has contributed a lot to the general public's nonchalant observance of Memorial Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmemorialday.org/backgrnd.html |title=Memorial Day History |last=Mechant |first=David |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |date=April 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Starting in 1987 [[Hawaii]]'s Senator [[Daniel Inouye]], a World War II veteran, introduced a measure to return Memorial Day to its traditional date. Inouye continued introducing the resolution until his death in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., 112th Congress (2011â€“2012), S.70&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional observance ==
On Memorial Day, the [[flag of the United States]] is raised briskly to the top of the staff and then solemnly lowered to the half-staff position, where it remains only until noon.&lt;ref name=&quot;PostPost2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peggy Post|author2=Anna Post|author3=Lizzie Post |author4=Daniel Post Senning |title=Emily Post's Etiquette, 18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIxPN_4IO34C&amp;pg=PT165|date=November 15, 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-210127-3|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is then raised to full-staff for the remainder of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Congress|title=United States Code, 2006, Supplement 1, January 4, 2007, to January 8, 2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-D35f9c0aUC&amp;pg=PA39 |date=October 22, 2009|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-083512-4|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memorial Day Observance in small New England town.jpg|thumb|Memorial Day observances in small [[New England]] [[town]]s are often marked by dedications and remarks by [[veterans]], [[state legislators]], and [[selectmen]].]]

The half-staff position remembers the more than one million men and women who gave their lives in service of their country. At noon, their memory is raised by the living, who resolve not to let their sacrifice be in vain, but to rise up in their stead and continue the fight for liberty and justice for all.

The [[National Memorial Day Concert]] takes place on the west lawn of the [[United States Capitol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnahan2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin J. Carnahan|title=Outdoor Escapes Washington, D.C.: A Four-Season Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkZSPa2l14MC&amp;pg=PA167|date=May 1, 2004|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-0-7627-3056-8|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert is broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and [[NPR]]. Music is performed, and respect is paid to the men and women who gave their lives for their country.

For many Americans, the central event is attending one of the thousands of parades held on Memorial Day in large and small cities all over the country. Most of these feature marching bands and an overall military theme with the National Guard and other servicemen participating along with veterans and military vehicles from various wars.

One of the longest-standing traditions is the running of the [[Indianapolis 500]], an auto race which has been held in conjunction with Memorial Day since 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Wilson|title=Driven by Desire: The Desire Wilson Story |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndAskfAnI2UC&amp;pg=PA92 |date=October 1, 2011 |publisher=Veloce Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-84584-389-2|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs on the Sunday preceding the Memorial Day holiday. [[NASCAR]]'s [[Coca-Cola 600]] has been held later the same day since 1961. The [[Memorial Tournament]] golf event has been held on or close to the Memorial Day weekend since 1976. The final of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship]] is currently held on Memorial Day.

In 2000, Congress passed the [[National Moment of Remembrance]] Act, asking people to stop and remember at 3:00 P.M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/causeintegration/2015/05/24/memorial-day-3pm-dont-forget/|title=Memorial Day, 3 p.m.: Don't Forget|last=Scott|first=Ryan|work=[[Forbes]]|date=May 24, 2015|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poppies ===
{{Main|Remembrance poppy}}

In 1915, following the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], Lieutenant Colonel [[John McCrae]], a physician with the Canadian Expeditionary Force, wrote the poem, &quot;[[In Flanders Fields]]&quot;. Its opening lines refer to the fields of poppies that grew among the soldiers' graves in Flanders.

In 1918, inspired by the poem, [[YWCA USA|YWCA]] worker [[Moina Michael]] attended a YWCA Overseas War Secretaries' conference wearing a silk poppy pinned to her coat and distributed over two dozen more to others present. In 1920, the National American Legion adopted it as their official symbol of remembrance.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc10nov06&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = | title =Where did the idea to sell poppies come from?  | publisher =BBC News | date =November 10, 2006 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6133312.stm  | accessdate=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Civil War, a new theme of death, sacrifice and rebirth enters the civil religion. Memorial Day gave ritual expression to these themes, integrating the local community into a sense of nationalism. The American civil religion, in contrast to that of France, was never anticlerical or militantly secular; in contrast to Britain, it was not tied to a specific denomination, such as the [[Church of England]]. The Americans borrowed from different religious traditions so that the average American saw no conflict between the two, and deep levels of personal motivation were aligned with attaining national goals.&lt;ref&gt;Robert N. Bellah, &quot;Civil Religion in America&quot;, ''Daedalus'' 1967 96(1): 1â€“21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorial Day has been called a &quot;modern [[cult of the dead]]&quot;. It incorporates Christian themes of sacrifice while uniting citizens of various faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtJpAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|title=God's New Israel|isbn=978-0-8078-6658-0|author1=Cherry|first1=Conrad|date=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In film, literature, and music ==

=== Films ===
* ''[[Memorial Day (2012 film)|Memorial Day]]'' (2012) is a [[war film]] starring [[James Cromwell]], Jonathan Bennett, and John Cromwell.

=== Music ===
* [[Charles Ives]]'s symphonic poem ''Decoration Day'' depicted the holiday as he experienced it in his childhood, with his father's band leading the way to the town cemetery, the playing of &quot;[[Taps]]&quot; on a trumpet, and a livelier march tune on the way back to the town. It is frequently played with three other Ives works based on holidays, as the second movement of ''[[A Symphony: New England Holidays]]''.

=== Poetry ===
Poems commemorating Memorial Day include:
* [[Michael Anania]]'s &quot;Memorial Day&quot; (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website=PoetryFoundation| url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/178467|title=Memorial Day |author=Anania, Michael|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
