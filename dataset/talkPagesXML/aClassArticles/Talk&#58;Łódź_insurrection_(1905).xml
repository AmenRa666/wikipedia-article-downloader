Why are [[Lodz insurrection]] and [[Lodz Insurrection]] redlinks?  [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]] 06:09, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

:Because they shouldn't be. :) [[user:Jeltz|Jeltz]] [[user talk:Jeltz|&lt;small&gt;talk&lt;/small&gt;]] 08:02, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks for fixing it.  [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]] 13:00, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

== GA Review ==

Lead mentions it was the largest disturbance, aftermath section mentions it was one of the largest. Background section needs more info about the start of the Russian Revolution - failure in Russo-Japanese war needs to be mentioned in addition to the massacre of 22 January. --[[User:Doopdoop|Doopdoop]] ([[User talk:Doopdoop|talk]]) 21:32, 30 March 2008 (UTC)
:Issues addressed, I hope.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 03:59, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

Some more remaining issues. Consider mentioning worsening economic conditions before the insurrection. Casualties of May 1st 1905 demonstration in Łódź might also deserve a mention. Ethnic composition of insurrection casualties is also a relevant detail (Według raportów naczelnika żandarmerii powiatu łódzkiego zabito 151 cywilów - 55 Polaków, 79 Żydów i 17 Niemców ). Russian Duma was established after the events described in the article, yet it is mentioned in the background section. 
Abbreviation PPS is not defined. 

Aftermath section - consider moving Ostrowiec Republic sentence to the [[revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905-1907)]] article. May demonstration in Warsaw probably refers to the 1905, but is presented in the aftermath (should be in the background). Not really sure, but the establishment of Duma, boycott of the elections by PPS might be mentioned in the Aftermath section. 

Wikipedia:MOSDEF requires an explanation of word &quot;Duma&quot;. &quot;Revolution of 1905 in Polish paintings&quot; picture gallery probably belongs to the [[revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905-1907)]] article. If you leave these paintings here, please add English translations of picture names and for Masłowski painting provide a short description of what is depicted. --[[User:Doopdoop|Doopdoop]] ([[User talk:Doopdoop|talk]]) 21:45, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

:All valid points, I will try to address them as time permits.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 21:42, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

::I have addressed most of the issues; I definitely would like to create [[revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905-1907)]] in the near future and split some material from here to that parent article.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 17:46, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

::One other thing, you may wish to reformat the citations from books to use page #'s, like we did for [[Battle of Arras (1917)]] Cheers, and good job on a difficult topic![[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] ([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]]) 21:14, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

I would like to get your comment about those issues that you haven't adressed. I believe Duma was established in late 1905, so according to chronological order it should not be mentioned in the background section. What is your opinion about mentioning ethnic composition of insurgents? Could you check the date of the May demonstrations in Warsaw that are mentioned in the aftermath section (if it is 1905 it should go into background section, not into aftermath). --[[User:Doopdoop|Doopdoop]] ([[User talk:Doopdoop|talk]]) 22:13, 9 April 2008 (UTC)
:Regarding Duma, I don't have access to Urbankowski right now, but I believe what he meant is that while the Duma might not have yet existed, the plans and demands for it were well known (after all, it's not like it appeared out of thin air surprising everybody with the novelty of the idea in August 1905). Hence, National Democrats supported the idea of Polish representation in the Russian to-be-created parliamentary system, while the nationalist socialists of Piłsudski were much less interested in that idea.
:I have no objections if somebody wants to add the ethnic composition of the fatalities, I do remember Davies citing it. That said, I would like to learn what is it based on - I have also seen much less precise estimates (such as the &quot;over 200 fatalities&quot; cited in the current article).
:There were quite a few demonstrations in Warsaw around that time. I will be moving this information to the newly created [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905-1907)]] soon in any case.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 17:46, 10 April 2008 (UTC)
::Are you OK with my latest edits? One source for the ethnic composition of the fatalities is [http://www.gazetawyborcza.pl/1,75478,3058864.html]. --[[User:Doopdoop|Doopdoop]] ([[User talk:Doopdoop|talk]]) 19:14, 10 April 2008 (UTC)
:::Yes; I am ok with those changes. Btw, I have finished expanding the revolution article, you may want to look over it.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 21:06, 10 April 2008 (UTC)


[[Image:Symbol_support_vote.svg|left|40px]] I am glad to report that this article nomination for [[WP:GA|good article]] status has been promoted, as it meets all good article criteria. --[[User:Doopdoop|Doopdoop]] ([[User talk:Doopdoop|talk]]) 21:41, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

== Irrelevant? ==

This seems to me irreleant - moved from article to here for discussion. --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 22:56, 26 May 2011 (UTC)

:In September 1905 [[Juliusz Karol Kunitzer]], owner of the Heintzel &amp; Kunitzer firm, was killed by two workers in the streets of Łódź.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A07E4DE153AE733A25752C0A9669D946497D6CF New York Times, 1 October 1905]&lt;/ref&gt;

::The politically-motivated assassination of a leading industrialist is hardly &quot;irrelevant&quot;. It was organized by the PPS, obviously part of the insurrection. [[User:HerkusMonte|HerkusMonte]] ([[User talk:HerkusMonte|talk]]) 11:39, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
:::I guess. Can you find any information on why he was assassinated? --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 16:22, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
::::He is described as a prototype of a capitalist exploiter, who didn't care much for his employees and always paid less than other industrialists of Łódź did. [[User:HerkusMonte|HerkusMonte]] ([[User talk:HerkusMonte|talk]]) 18:42, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
