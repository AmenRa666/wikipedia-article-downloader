==COLONEL R.J.A. PERRON==
I believe the whole section about the Colonel, Director Cadets, has been entirely lifted from the National Defence website, even though source has been provided...this technically constitutes plagiarism, no? [[User:Luckyluke|Luke]] 07:08, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
: I have removed the section as a copyright violation from: Department of National Defence [http://www.forces.gc.ca/dsa/app_bio/engraph/FSeniorOfficerBiographyView_e.asp?SectChoice=1&amp;mAction=View&amp;mBiographyID=523 See Source Page] [[User:Flying Canuck|Flying Canuck]] 21:09, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

== Warrants are not Sr NCOs ==

I changed the rank table to separate the Warrant Officers from the F/Sgts and Sgts.  Warrant Officers are NOT NCOs.  WO1s, WOIIs, F/Sgts and Sgts are all Sr Non-commissioned members but Sgts and Flight Sergeants are the only ones of the four that are also NCOs.
: Where is the reference that refers to any cadet as an NCO (Non-commissioned Officer)? (PS. Please sign your comments by using four tildes &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 08:34, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
:: The National Defence Act categorizes members of the Canadian Forces that are not commissioned officers as ''Non Commissioned Members''. I will update this terminology in this article. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 21:57, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
::: But cadets are not members of the Canadian Forces. [[User:216.23.136.226|216.23.136.226]] 20:31, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
:::: Yes, correct... I forget what sentence I was originally referring to. I think the article used to say something like, &quot;cadets, like members of the Canadian Forces are called non-commissioned officers&quot;, but both errors in this statement have since been corrected it seems. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 04:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
Actually QR and O CF defines NCO as those of Cpl and Sgt rank and NCM as anyone not an officer. 
There is no differentiation in the Cadet Program as there are no longer cadet officer ranks.  Cadets are cadets. [[User:24.108.176.42|24.108.176.42]] 04:19, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:NCM is a phrase peculiar to the post-unification CF, and refers to ''everyone but'' commissioned officers. For the purposes of splitting up ranks lacking the Queen's commission, the appropriate terms for Army and Air purposes (whether CF or Cadet) are Warrant Officers (Chief Warrant Officer, Master Warrant Officer, Warrant Officer - WOI and WOII), NCOs (Sergeants, Master Corporals, and Corporals in the CF, although Cpl is often termed as a Junior NCO - Flight Sergeant, Sergeant, and Corporal) and Other Ranks (Privates, Recruits/Leading Air Cadet, Air Cadet). 

:The navy, lacking the strong warrant officer presence of the army, splits between Chief Petty Officers (&quot;Chiefs&quot;), Petty Officers (&quot;POs&quot;) and Other Ranks - &quot;men,&quot; while historically suitable, has, for obvious reasons, fallen out of use. Navy warrants were, originally, closer the officer side, and were either near-civilian specialists (surgeons, pursers), or near-officer ranks/appointments: gunners, bosuns, and (sailing) masters. Today's CF has no naval warrants, although I believe the RN has retained them.

:Insofar as this applies to Wikipedia articles, the term &quot;NCM&quot; seems to be avoided altogether when discussing cadets, whilst the older terms (Warrants, NCOs, and Other Ranks) are used as appropriate. 

:24.108.176.42, cadets, in a well-run unit, fill the roles of their CF counterparts - the terminology definitely applies.
[[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 00:30, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

==Three Aims correct==

In the three aims area it said air, sea and land while the air cadets (The topic of the page) only develop an interest in the air element of the CF. The sea cadets handle sea element and army cadets land element. At the time of this edit the cadets page is down so I do not have the exact wording so, I will wait until the page is back up and I can get it from the book.
:: CATO 54-01 gives the aims of the RCAC : a. to develop in youth the attributes of good citizenship and leadership; b. to promote physical fitness; and c. to stimulate the interest of youth in the Air element of the Canadian Forces. I would have thought this would be more appropriate for this page than the aims of the organisation as a whole. [[User:216.23.136.226|216.23.136.226]] 20:54, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
It makes little sense to choose the reference that suits a point of view.  QR and O Cadets is the senior document to CATO.  At the same time QR and O as is pointed out says cadets shall not be promoted but appointed ... at the same time the Air Cadet Rank CATO uses promoted and suggests QR and O is to be amended.  Go figure???  

On the other hand, it doesn't matter whether a child is in sea, army or air cadets one aspect of the aim of the program is to bring attention to all elements of the CF while participating in a focused elemental program.  Air Cadets and Army Cadets visit HMC ships.  [[User:24.108.176.42|24.108.176.42]]

== Summer Camp Chart ==

We should work to create a simple chart that outlines the requirements and a short description of each summer course. Gliding and Flying are currently discussed in paragraph form, but I could see this getting a little out of hand as more courses are added. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 08:47, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
:Also, if anyone could get all the crests together for the &quot;camps,&quot; that might add some colour to the page; see [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets]] for an example.[[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 18:06, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

Our summer camp chart still needs some work. I moved all of the badges into the chart, but the badges are different sizes. We also need a short description for each of them. This is an area that anyone could help out on. What do you think about stating the length of the course, a brief statement of outcome for a cadet that is on the course, and perhaps some prerequisites? [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 22:19, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

== Thoughts - not wanting to step on feet!==
Another note: have a look at the Sea wiki page - would a comparable treatment of the ranks be of interest? Also, HMCS Quadra, has, at least for the past six years, never had an Air Cadet presence, excepting glider and power pilots coming over to use the confidence course.[[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 17:11, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
:Yes, I think so... Right now, each of the upper level Air Cadet ranks has its own wiki page! I'm sure these are not notable individually, but notable only because they are related to the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. I'd like to merge them with this page very soon. I really like the RCSC page and would actually like to have this page evolve to something close to it. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 19:20, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
:And no worries about stepping on feet :) Let's make these pages great. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 19:23, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

== Air Cadet Banner ==

I've been trying to find out information about the RCAC banner and am having no luck. How did you find out what it looks like? Any suggestions about where to start? [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 21:01, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

There have been number of revisions to the section on the Air Cadet Banner revolving around it being paraded at the SL Grad Parades (plural).  Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't there just one, single, SL course in Canada out of Cold Lake?[[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] ([[User talk:Jpjohnsn|talk]]) 13:28, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

== Material for public consumption ==
Cadet ranks should have the modifier cadet in them in accordance with QR and O (Cadets) (a separate document regarding the Cadet program not CF QR and O)  The is one aim of the Cadet program..wtih three parts..it ends to instil in youth an interest in the sea, land and air activities of the Canadian Forces ... it applies to all cadets sea, army, and air and is not element specific. The League and the CF spend considerable time discussing terminology and consistency would serve everyone best. Somehow someone put a photo of a missile in place of the C/Sgt rank ... I removed it and will leave it to you to replace.  Sorry if I messed with the graphics coding. It would be best to leave out any reference to an additional rank (C/F/Cpl or whatever).  No announcement has been made and certainly, Wikipedia is not authorized to speak on behalf of the cadet organization in advance of any formal announcement. The issue is still a rumour until and if it is announced.  Cheers.  [[User:24.108.176.42|24.108.176.42]] 05:25, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
: Thank you for your help. Have you thought of getting an account? I agree that the additional rank should not be included yet as there are no references to support it yet. From looking at the file history for the missle picture, I think the Sgt rank picture actually linked to a picture of a missle that was called the Sergeant ... wierd. We'll need to find a new picture. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 08:07, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

The Flight Corporal rank has been announced internally, though not yet officially introduced, via Commanding Officer's conferences and the like, and is the subject of intense discussion on www.cadet-world.com/cwforums, an entirely unofficial site for members of various cadet programs operated by Cadet Instructor Cadre on their own time, including officers currently serving with DCdts  in Ottawa and various regional headquarters.
[[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 18:16, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

Additionally, I've cleaned up the image problems... FCpl should stay - we're Wikipedia, not a DND press release. Ditto for &quot;Cadet&quot; everything; not only is it not reflective of common practice, but it looks incredibly bad to repeat the same word more than is needful.
[[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 18:48, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
:I don't think we can include the Flight Corporal rank unless we can give a reference so that somebody else can verify our statements (see [[WP:V]]). I'll try to find something. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 20:50, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

I'll see if I can get a citeable e-mail from one of the headquarters officers on Cadet World. [[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 21:30, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

Each of you. Quadra and Sancho have a lot to offer fixing these pages and making them reflect well on the Cadet Organization.  You have the technical skills.  It is also worth considering that members of the CF are constrained in their ability to produce material for the public on any CF or Government program. DAOD 2008, and Q R and O apply. Therefore precision is paramount rather than perception, guess work, or rumour.  It would be counterproductive through your well meaning and important effort to cause a CATO or Routine Order to be constructed and issued thereby amplifying those regulations and further restricting participating in this process by members of the organization unless authorized. That is a serious consideration. 

With regard to &quot;cadet&quot; rank ... this is an encyclopedia, and using cadet, while repetataive it is the correct nomenclature for cadets of all elements in both french and english.  [[User:131.137.245.199|131.137.245.199]] 22:48, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

How about this... we leave the &quot;Cadet&quot; in the ranks section of this article, but mention that in practice, cadets are often simply referred to as their rank without the &quot;cadet&quot; prefix. We could reference the Level 1 training handbook for this. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 17:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

== Quota vs Vacancies ==

Does this fit in? It seems very detail-ish that even people within the organization often don't know. I think this distracts from the flow of the page and doesn't add much to our description of the RCAC. It would be like an article on Company X including a chart of number of management positions. What do you think about removing it? [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 17:54, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

* It probably doesn't add much and doesn't mean much to anyone unless they are in the program. An alternative may be a link to the CATO, but the same comment applies ... what does it mean unless you are an Air Cadet Sgt, and want to know your chances of FSgt?? [[User:131.137.245.199|131.137.245.199]] 20:53, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

==&quot;Organisation&quot;==
This is entirely a semantic question - any better title than &quot;Organisation&quot; for the cadet outfits? (ie, RCAirC Organisation) &quot;Service&quot; sounds better, but doesn't really work grammatically in that context, and besides might not be the best term (that's a different discussion altogether!). &quot;Movement&quot; sounds like something one sees the base doctor about... maybe lower-case &quot;organisation&quot; would be best? [[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 23:19, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
: I like lower-case &quot;organisation&quot;. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 22:21, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
:: I found this backgrounder from the Canadian Forces regarding the &quot;Canadian Cadet Organizations&quot;. The term &quot;Canadian  Cadet Organizations&quot; is used consistently throughout the document. What do you think about changing our wording? [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 03:30, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

==Verifiability and Reliable Sources==
There has been some discussion on this page and several edits/reverts related to a Flight Corporal rank. It was mentioned above that &quot;precision is paramount rather than perception, guess work, or rumour&quot;. This is captured well in Wikipedia's policies on verifiability ([[WP:V]]) and reliable sources ([[WP:RS]]). These policies remove ambiguity about what is appropriate material to appear in a Wikipedia article. The phrase that I think expresses the idea the best is, &quot;The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth&quot;. Please read these policies if you're concerned that an edit that you have made has been reverted or corrected inappropriately, and continue to help us make this a great page. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 19:04, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

== Aims and motto deserving of subsections? ==

Do you think the aims and the motto should be in subsections or in paragraphs in the intro? (The aims are currently written in two places: a paragraph in the intro, and repeated in a stand-alone section.) [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 05:14, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

*Stand alone -- multiple editors have created redundancy [[User:131.137.245.199|131.137.245.199]] 16:42, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

* For now, for continuity with the other CanCadet pages, have placed aims in a para, along with the motto. [[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 00:46, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

==Colours versus Flags==

The Flags of the RCAC sections needs a major rewrite.  There are many statements are either not true or personal opinion.  1)The sqn banner may also include an embroidered squadron crest rather than the RCAC crest. 2)QR and O (Cadets) specifically states that the flags used by air cadets may not be referred to as Colours.  You can't have a Colour Party without colours so they are Flag Parties not Colour Parties; 3)Flags parties don't &quot;typically&quot; carry 3 flags.  Only the units that don't obey the regulations.  The Manual of Drill and Ceremonial only indicates the carrying of 1 or 2 colours or flags.[[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] 03:05, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:RCAirC squadrons do typically disregard the 201 and carry three flags - poke about on their official photo galleries if you wish! As far as the embroidered squadron crest, please check your source on that one; Canadian and British air unit crests don't, to the best of my knowledge, find their way onto official flags. Could be wrong, though - haven't ever seen an Air Force squadron's stand of colours. 

Every single CF Sqn's banner has their crest embroidered on it. An example is here: http://www.snowbirds.dnd.ca/site/_assets/grfx/history/431sqd_colors.jpg Air Cadets Sqn's are similarly allowed.  When my squadron had their crest approved, the Air Cadet League arranged for us to get a new squadron banner with the crest on it rather than the air cadet crest.[[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] 22:50, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:Colour parties... it's a long-winded debate in the making. RCSC tends to call their sheet-on-a-stick carriers colour parties due to Naval custom (colours, to us damp ones, means any ship's nationally-identifying bit of cloth, not a consecrated item - and, in the freaky habit of the naval service, this terminology continues on land), entirely separate from the Army traditions from which the RCAF (now Air Element) sprung, whilst Army and Air cadet units seem to divide into two camps. One is that the 201 calls the formation a colour party, so whatever they're carrying, be it consecrated under the Sovereign's own eye, or be it a DND-stamped pillowcase, they're a colour party. The other view is that, as the embroidered sheet on a stick isn't a colour, the formation is a flag party. From an entirely personal POV, I'd say the 201 would be the deciding and senior document - the CF &quot;colour party&quot; might include no item that is actually a colour - banners, ensigns, command flags, the Canadian Flag; all these are carried by &quot;colour parties.&quot; Anyway, enough rambling. Point here is that the terms are debatable - therefore, we mention the debate, or at least the possibility of debate (the difference between the 201 and the CATO). [[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 05:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

The 201 is not the senior document as it is a MANUAL not orders.  In both the Cadet Admin and Trg ORDERS and Queen's Regulations and ORDERS (cadets), it is mentioned that the flags are not to be referred to as colours. Also, carrying the Canadian Flag along with the ensign and sqn banner does not seem to be authorized by the CATO covering the use of cadet flags (CATO 12-05). Finally, the 201  gives directions for both colour and flag parties.  All these together should mean that there is no need for a debate. [[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] 22:50, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:The three-flag party isn't authorized - but it is incredibly common: thus, it'll stay. I'll double-check the 201 re: terminology for the formation (never heard of a CF flag party in that context). As for the not referred to as colours, the question there is what, precisely, &quot;refer&quot; means - whether something like &quot;Pvt Jones, grab the squadron flags,&quot; vs. &quot;squadron colours,&quot; or if it's a blanket deletion of &quot;colours&quot; from the cadet vocabulary.


==Bayonets==
Anyone got a decent reference as to ''why'' the RCAirC ban on bayonets? The current air force, the old RCAF, and both the historical and the current RAF, use them... a good explanation, for personal interest, would be nice; however, for the article, a referenced work would be even better. [[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 05:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
:Bayonets are not used, because many mistakes have been made with them. Quite a few good cadets forgot to attach them correctly and had them go flying of while doing rifle drill. [[User:Dreamafter|Dreamy]] 22:08, 8 May 2007 (UTC)
::That isn't the reason.  Army cadets and Sea are authorized and for the same reason why they can fire the C-7 and air cadets can't.  Swords, rifles and bayonets have been traditionally used by those elements in war where the primary ''weapon'' of the air force is aircraft.  It is part of an attempt to clearly mark the differences between the three elements.  That is the explanation given to me by a former Regional Cadet Officer but there doesn't seem to be written reference for it. It should be noted that air cadets CAN use them when at a sea or army cadet summer training centre to ''allow Air Cadets to fully participate in the training and accept parade appointments at these CSTCs where the performance of drill with bayonets is required.''[[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] 12:52, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

==Aims==
Language indicating the elementally-focused nature of the CF-related training would be desirable; can one of the would-be (or actual!) PAFFOs come up with something suitable? Thanks! [[User:Quadra|Quadra]] 00:26, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

Maybe it's just my prejudice but I'd like to get the link to the Cadet Wikia removed.  I looked it over and it's so full of errors and one person's vision of what the CCM should be that it's next to useless.  There isn't a single reference used in any any article I looked at.

== Badge ==

Anon user, can you please cite your source for the wording you insist on inserting into the &quot;Badge&quot; section?  This may be technical heraldic language, but it isn't necessary to write Wikipedia in this fashion - the main aim is to make articles that easily communicate information, for the ease of the reader.  It certainly doesn't make any sense to me.  For instance, the description:
* &quot;a circle surrounded by a wreath of [[maple]] leaves on [[eagle]] volant affronte the head to the sinister. The whole ensigned by the Royal crown proper - ''fashioned as a [[St. Edward's Crown]]'' (to symbolise the Canadian Monarch as the Cadets' source of authority) below upon a scroll ROYAL CANADIAN AIR CADETS in french and english&quot;
says to me
* &quot;a circle surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves on top of an eagle flying in front with the head to the left.  The whole is topped (?) by the royal crown, but very importantly, the St. Edward's Crown (to symbolize the Sovereign's authority), underneath but on top of a scroll yelling ROYAL CANADIAN AIR CADETS in english, but the words in french are the same.&quot;
The description seems to contradict itself in at least three places, in both french and english.  Of course, maybe I'm simply completely illiterate in heraldic language - so again, can you provide your source? --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 22:28, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

I exchanged some interesting e-mails with the Air Cadet League national office about the &quot;birds&quot; used in the ensign and badge.  Their Policies and Procedures Manual stated that the bird on the ensign was an albatross and on the badge it's a falcon.  I sent them a correction and the responded that, after checking copies of the actual submissions to the Chester Herald and CHA, the bird on the ensign is indeed an eagle (and they will correct the PPM) but the bird on the badge is most definitely a falcon and was specifically chosen as such.  They felt that the eagle belonged to the &quot;air force&quot; and that a falcon was a less agressive symbol and therefore more appropriate.  If this is true, the article needs to be corrected.

== Switched back to list of summer camps for now ==

I removed the table of summer courses. It just looked so unwieldly. The problem was that many of the rows were taking up much more vertical space than necessary, partly due to differing image heights, and partly due to having one of the boxes in a row have text, while the other boxes were empty. A good example of a table that doesn't have these problems is the table of [[Merit_badge_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29#List_of_current_merit_badges|Boy Scout Merit badges]]. To get to this state, we'll need to trim down all of the badges to equal sized squares, then we can use small thumbnails so that the table won't take up much more room than the list does right now. You can go back in the history to find the links to the current images of the summer course badges, or you could scan/photocopy some of your own and update the images of the summer course badges. I've left a link in the article to the Canadian Forces symbol poster. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 20:01, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

== supported in the local community ==

This statement seems a little to restrictive as compared with what the Air Cadet League's responsibilities are as outlined in the memorandum of understanding (see references). Many provincial responsibilities have listed as requiring the planning, assistance, and support of the Air Cadet League. Perhaps we can change it from &quot;supported in the local community by the Air Cadet League...&quot; to &quot;supported by the Air Cadet League...&quot;. [[User:Sanchom|Sancho McCann]] 19:48, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== Paragraph form for Summer Training section ==

I shortened the summer training section into paragraph form. It seemed like a little too much weight was given to such specific details about summer training courses in an article that is about Air Cadets in general. Perhaps more detail can be given at [[Royal_Canadian_Air_Cadet_Training]] Quadra had started, but hasn't been developed much further. I think that is the place to go into more detail if desired. &lt;span style=&quot;font: small-caps 1em Optima&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Sanchom|Sancho]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:56, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

== Rank Table ==

The NEW rank table looks exactly the same as the one present before the re-write but it does look nice.  I changed the pre-requisites for LAC as the CATO was changed to only requiring 5 months time in almost 2 years ago.  You could probably add the pre-requisites for FCpl into the table as they have been promulgated in the recently amended CATO 55-04.  Too bad they still haven't told us what the rank will actually look like [[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] 14:27, 27 April 2007 (UTC)
:The reason that I trimmed the table is because one of the criteria at [[Wikipedia:What is a good article?]] is &quot;stays focused on the main topic without going into unnecessary details&quot;. I thought that the table went into a bit too much detail. Does a general reader need to know prerequisites for ranks? Or are the names, badges, and relative ordering of the ranks sufficient? &lt;span style=&quot;font: small-caps 1em Optima&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Sanchom|Sancho]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:14, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

:::Yeah, it's not too bad. I remember about half a year ago, this article even included quotas for numbers of ranks dependent on squadron size... so in comparison, the article has become much more relevant to a general reader. I don't think though that we should include the detailed rank prerequisite information because it isn't anywhere else on  Wikipedia; we need a better reason for including it like... is it encyclopedic? does it deserve as much weight as it is given with respect to the other information in the article? Especially because it is in a table, it's the one thing that stands out in this page (aside from the pictures).

== Squadron? ==

Um... Okay. Why are we using squadron all the time. I happen to know that they are not all &quot;squadrons&quot;, but some are so large that they are &quot;wings&quot;. This means that they have at least two squadrons in them. An example is [http://www.cadets.net/est/632aviation/index.htm 632 Wing]. It is part of the Air Cadet movement. [[User:Dreamafter|Dreamy]] 02:31, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
:I was using squadron because it is the unit of organization described in the QR&amp;O(Cadets) and CATO 11-10. There is no formal unit called a wing. Even if you look through the website that you linked to, the word &quot;squadron&quot; is mentioned throughout: &quot;Squadron Staff&quot;, &quot;Welcome to 632 Phoenix-Telesat Squadron&quot;, &quot;Squadron Cadet Commanders&quot;. The parade formation, however, can be arranged in a wing, as seems to be the case at 632 Squadron. They have a &quot;Wing Commander&quot; parade position and two &quot;Squadron Commander&quot; parade positions. I know of several other squadrons that have (or have had previously) their parade arranged in a wing formation, or more accurately, &quot;wing in column of squadrons&quot; formation. If we were to include the reference to wing, it should be only in the description of parade formats I think, but that might be better left for another article such as [[Parade (military)]] (which coincidentally looks like it still has much room for improvement/expansion). Then we could link to that article by saying something like, &quot;squadrons [[Parade (military)|parades]] each training night in one of several formations, depending on their size&quot;. What do you think? &lt;span style=&quot;font: small-caps 1em Optima&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Sanchom|Sancho]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:19, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

== Level badges ==

::How is it now? [[User:Dreamafter|Dreamy]] 23:57, 15 June 2007 (UTC)
I think that the Training Level section still needs some work:
*The badges are referred to in CATOs as &quot;Squadron Proficiency Level Badges&quot; not level badges or qualification badges.
*There is actually no need to list the prerequisites for the badges in the table.  A mention in the main article that the cadets who complete a training level are eligible to wear the appropriate proficiency level badge on the lower left sleeve of their tunic. To say that the pre-requisite for getting the Level 3 badge is completing level 3 is redundant.

*It should be mentioned that WOs do not wear proficiency level badges.  The CATO says it best &quot;In view of their rank, Warrant Officers First Class (WO1) and Second Class (WO2) shall not wear Squadron Proficiency Level Badges&quot;

*Again, there is no clear reference for separating cadets into Junior and Senior Levels.  CATOs and other supporting documents frequently conflict.  There just should be 1 table, 5 columns wide simply showing the badges. [[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] 18:00, 24 October 2007 (UTC)

== Fair use ==
Hi, I removed the picture of the march past because although the image description page claims fair-use, no [[Wikipedia:Fair_use_rationale_guideline|fair use rationale]] is given. I don't believe one is forthcoming for this image since it is ''replaceable''. It should be possible to obtain a free image depicting what this image currently does (even if one isn't available right now). This is why I don't think we can use it on Wikipedia. Contrast the lack of rationale at [[:Image:222_RCAirCS_March_Past.JPG]] with the provided rationale at [[:Image:Aircadet.jpg#Fair_use_rationale]]. (I tried to add a fair use rational to the march past image, but couldn't get around the replaceability issue.)

Other images that should be replaced with free alternatives include the rank badges and flying wings (like the level badges). However, the level badges currently have contradictory licencing statements on their image description pages that I think could easily be fixed. (Dreamafter, have you made any progress with that?)

I removed the sentences because they weren't supported by the references, and removed the abbreviations because (as per [[Wikipedia:MOS#Acronyms and abbreviations]], we shouldn't use unwarranted abbreviations.

==Notable former Air Cadets==
The reference cited for this section does not distinguish between elements. Was Marc Garneau an Air Cadet or a Sea Cadet? He was after all a Naval Officer in the Reg Force and an Honourary Captain of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets. [[User:Sbmcmull|McMuff]] 14:03, 21 March 2008 (UTC)


I think a major clean-up seems to be in order for this section.  For example, Jim Carrey keeps getting added and I have only ever heard him talk about being a Sea Cadet.  Should we be looking for some citations for the names?[[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] ([[User talk:Jpjohnsn|talk]]) 17:38, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

==GA Sweeps Review: On Hold==
As part of the [[WP:WGA|WikiProject Good Articles]], we're doing [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps|sweeps]] to go over all of the current GAs and see if they still meet the [[WP:WIAGA|GA criteria]]. I'm specifically going over all of the &quot;Culture and Society&quot; articles. I believe the article currently meets the majority of the criteria and should remain listed as a [[WP:GA|Good article]]. However, in reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that need to be addressed. I have made minor corrections and have included several points below that need to be addressed for the article to remain a GA. Please address them within seven days and the article will maintain its GA status. If progress is being made and issues are addressed, the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted. If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at [[WP:GAN]]. To keep tabs on your progress so far, either strike through the completed tasks or put checks next to them.

Needs inline citations:
#&lt;strike&gt;&quot;A flag party carrying two flags (consisting of five people) will have two escorts positioned behind the flags usually with deactivated Lee Enfield rifles.&quot; This has been tagged since August 2007.&lt;/strike&gt;
#&lt;strike&gt;&quot;A flag party only carrying one flag (consisting of three people) usually carries no rifles.&quot; This has been tagged since August 2007.&lt;/strike&gt;
::Completed - These have been deleted and replaced with a single statement regarding the use of drill purpose rifles with flag parties.[[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] ([[User talk:Jpjohnsn|talk]]) 13:46, 21 June 2008 (UTC)

Other issues:
#&lt;strike&gt;The lead needs to be expanded to two or three paragraphs to better summarize the article. Look to [[WP:LEAD]] for guidelines.&lt;/strike&gt;
::Completed - Mostly re-organized existing material and added a couple of minor things.  Hopefully, this is want you wanted.[[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] ([[User talk:Jpjohnsn|talk]]) 17:09, 23 June 2008 (UTC)
#,&lt;strike&gt;If possible, flesh out the &quot;Honorary appointments&quot; section or incorporate it into another section (possibly the &quot;Notable former air cadets&quot; section?).&lt;/strike&gt;
::Completed - Changes the &quot;organizational&quot; infobox to military infobox.  It has a section on honourary appointments.  Moved the reference there.  I'm going to leave a note on the military infobox discussion page to see if they can add &quot;languages&quot; and, perhaps, website.[[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] ([[User talk:Jpjohnsn|talk]]) 16:36, 23 June 2008 (UTC)

This article covers the topic well and if the above issues are addressed, I believe the article can remain a GA. I will leave the article on hold for seven days, but if progress is being made and an extension is needed, one may be given. I will leave messages on the talk pages of the main contributors to the article along with the related WikiProject so that the workload can be shared. If you have any questions, let me know on my talk page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

:Thanks for the feedback! I was one of the editors that worked on this article in the past and would be glad to work on addressing these issues. Unfortunately, I'll be unable to contribute until probably July 1... after the seven days that an article is usually placed on hold. If nobody else is able to address these issues, I would request that the &quot;on hold&quot; period be extended in this case; I would work on correcting them pretty quickly upon my return.

::In re-reading the section on flags, the sections requiring citations actually have errors.  The determining factor of whether rifles are carried or not has more to do with *which* flags are carried (as well as regional regulations) than the *number* of flags carried.

===GA Sweeps Review: Pass===
I believe the article currently meets the criteria and should remain listed as a [[WP:GA|Good article]]. Altogether the article is well-written and looks good after addressing the above issues. Continue to improve the article making sure all new information is properly sourced and neutral. It would also be beneficial to go through the article and update all of the access dates of the inline citations and fix any dead links. If you have any questions, let me know on my talk page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I have updated the article history to reflect this review.

== &quot;Clarifications&quot; 9 Nov 08 ==

I have changed a couple of the revisions for clarifications for the following reasons:

- Programme vs program.  While I prefer to spell the word as programme, the use of the form program in official publications like Cadet Program Update makes the use of both spellings messy and confusing. 

- Boys, girls and children.  Using young men, women, young people and youth is preferable.  Eighteen year-olds are not legally considered children in most jurisdications so saying &quot;children 12-18&quot; is inaccurate while &quot;young people 12 to 18&quot; is a better fit.  Also, the word &quot;children&quot; is not mentioned in any official publications.  &quot;Youth&quot;, on the other hand, is (ie. &quot;develop in youth...&quot; and &quot;stimulate the interest of youth...&quot; in the aim of the cadet movement).  In QR&amp;O (Cadets), boys and girls is replaced by &quot;persons&quot;.

-Power of command.  The statement that cadets have no power of command of members of the CF is taken from QR&amp;O(Cadets).  The &quot;clarification&quot; was less accurate.

== RC(Air)C in Germany ==

The article does not make mention of the exceptional existence of the RCAirC in Germany. In the latter part of the 70's, I was a member of 800 Black Forest Sqn (Baden-Soellingen contingent) before it cleaved away from Lahr to come into its own as 856 Rhine Valley Sqn. I can also say that on average we had about 30 cadets in 856 Sqn in Baden and that there were about the same numbers in 800 Sqn in Lahr, perhaps a few more. I thought it could/should be an interesting and notable point in the context of this article. I cannot really make the edit/addition to the main article as I do not have any dates such as when the squadrons were established or when they were repatriated/disbanded. I can only comment that 856 Sqn came into being in 1977 or 1978 (this was also about the time we began to receive our new standard green uniforms), and that I know it was eventually re-formed in Pickering, Ontario (likely sometime after base closure in 1993). Does anyone else think that this may be a significant enough point to note in the article?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/99.246.128.26|99.246.128.26]] ([[User talk:99.246.128.26|talk]]) 17:41, 10 June 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Air Cadet Motto History ==

I am not experienced with writing or editing Wikipedia articles, but I would like to see a paragraph added to cover off the history of the Air Cadet Motto &quot;To Learn, To Serve, To Advance&quot;.  It took me a few years to track down sources at the Air cadet league Headquarters in Ottawa, but I was ultimately successful back in 2005. Ms Sarah Putinski had researched the file as per my request and found the original submission, hand written in pencil.

Cadet Robert Miles Colwell of 625 (Southern Victoria) Sqn (now inactive) located in Perth-Andover NB submitted the paper in 1966, in response to a competetion to come up with a motto in that year.  He apparently did not realize that it was a national competetion at the time, and only found out when he was summoned to the Principal's office at Southern Victoria (then &quot;Regional&quot;) High School to be congratulated as the winner of the National Air cadet Motto competition. He was presented with a wooden plaque with a brass RC Air C badge, fully coloued in.  A photo was taken and I recall seeing it in 625 Sqn files, but since the Sqn folded in the mid 1980s, it and all other history has been tragically lost.

Noting that the origin of the motto was missing from Air Cadet history, I made contact with Ms Putinski at the Air cadet League of Canada Headquarters in Ottawa in 2005.  In a few short days, she located the original submission, hand written in pencil received from Cadet Robert (Bob) Colwell.  The submission originally read &quot; To Learn, To Serve '''and''' To Advance&quot;, but the &quot;and&quot; was dropped in favour of the cleaner tri-statement. She subsequently organized through the ACLC HQ for Mr. Colwell to be the Guest of Honour at the Christmas &quot;Mess&quot; Dinner for 161 C.K. Beveridge Sqn at the Barrack Green Armoury in Saint John NB in December 2005.  That was the closest Sqn to Mr. Colwell who lived in St Stephen NB at the time.  Mr. Colwell was subsequently presented a second plaque (this time pewter)by the NB regional representative Mr. Tom White on behalf of the president of the ACLC.  He was honoured as &quot;A Permanent Legacy&quot; of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, owing to his significant contribution of the official motto. The Air Cadet League of Canada bears the same motto. The League subsequently granted him the (then) newly created Air Cadet Long Service Medal.

As part of the &quot;permanent legacy&quot;, his name along with the history was supposed to have been included in the curriculum of the Royal Canadian Air cadet Program, but I'm not sure that this has been actioned to date. An article covering the event was subsequently written in the NB provincial newspaper &quot;The Telegraph Journal&quot;.  I have photographs of the original plaque, the presentations at Barrack Green Armoury in 2005 and all of the e-mail correspondence with the League as evidence which validates this history which I can provide. 

Any advice/assistance I could get in ensuring this histroy is accurately captured would be greatly appreciated!

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=707373492 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive http://web.archive.org/web/20120419213623/http://www.cadets.ca/regions/atl/content-contenu.aspx?id=95843 to http://www.cadets.ca/regions/atl/content-contenu.aspx?id=95843

When you have finished reviewing my changes, please set the ''checked'' parameter below to '''true''' or '''failed''' to let others know (documentation at {{tlx|Sourcecheck}}).

{{sourcecheck|checked=false}}
