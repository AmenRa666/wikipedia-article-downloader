== Uranium shipment? ==
Does anyone have any additional detail about the proposed uranium shipment on the I-52? - --mkamat 21:02, August 26, 2005 (UTC)

== Kojima Hideo disambiguation ==
The link to Rear Admiral Kojima Hideo points to the famous game developer Hideo Kojima, who was born in 1964. I don't know if they're related, but they're definitely not the same person. I'm removing this link. --[[User:Djakdarippa|Djakdarippa]] 14:39, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

== Any word on the salvage? ==

OK,  It's May 2006.  Any word on the salvage operations, mentioned in the last paragraph?&lt;br /&gt;

Good question. I have found nothing on it. My suspicion is until they (investors) actually see some salvage gold, in advance, it would be hard to get backing for this effort. May 2007...[[User:Engr105th|Engr105th]] 20:28, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

== Most advanced sub of WW2 ?? ==

I'm uncertain of the veracity of a statement in the paragraph &quot;Type C-3 subs&quot;...It says &quot;They were the largest submarines ever built at that time, and were known as the most advanced submarines of their time.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
They were most definitely the ''largest''. But they were basically cargo vessels. One could easily say the German Elektroboots (e.g. Type 21 &amp; 23's?) were the most ''advanced'' at least as far as technology - which is what most people mean by &quot;advanced&quot;...The Elektroboots were a bit later, but were under development about that time. Even if they weren't concurrent with the C-3 subs, the C-3's certainly were not &quot;advanced&quot; weapons... &lt;br /&gt;
Anybody else have thoughts on it?&lt;br /&gt; [[User:Engr105th|Engr105th]] 20:23, 24 May 2007 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:: Folks, not having had any response to my post above of 24 May 2007, I took the liberty of adding &quot;Japanese&quot; to the sentence about it being the most advanced sub of its time. Seems to me that might even be questionable. [[User:Engr105th|Engr105th]] 03:49, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

== Recording? ==
The article mentions sonobuoy and cockpit recordings. Does anyone know if these are available online? [[User:75.75.110.235|75.75.110.235]] 17:26, 10 July 2007 (UTC)

Yes, they are available online at http://hnsa.org/sound/index.htm#i52wire : [[User:Mkamat|Proteus]] 21:15, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

== more submarines? ==

Aren't there more submarines who undertook the same mission? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterseeboot_859  &lt;small&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.93.20.86|213.93.20.86]] ([[User talk:213.93.20.86|talk]]) 09:46, 14 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:Take a look at the paragraph on the Yanagi Missions, on this article. You'll see several subs that attempted or made the Japan to Europe mission. Of course, the payoff for these risky and expensive attempts was nil, taking into account the whole war. [[User:Engr105th|Engr105th]] ([[User talk:Engr105th|talk]]) 20:53, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

== Japanese_submarine_I-52_(1943) ==

Under the paragraph VALUABLE CARGO stands the sentence: &lt;&lt;there is no evidence of the Japanese government being interested in peace proposals or negotiated settlements at this early stage of the war, prior to summer of 1945...&gt;&gt;
While this concept was part of the official stance of the US government (and perhaps still holds in US history books), this is far from the truth.
After declassification processes in the 90's and the public availability of documents from various actors of the time, it is a fact that Japan had instigated overtures as early as spring 1944.
The path was by short wave radio cables to their Ambassador (Sato) in Moscow, whom was forwarding them to the Soviet government  for further despatch to their US ally. At least once they proceeded through diplomatic channels in Stockholm.
On Feb 2nd, 1945 (2 days before Yalta's conference), Franklin Roosevelt received a 40-page memo from Mac Arthur outlining five separate SURRENDER overtures from highly placed Japanese officials (cf. Admiral Leahy - Chief of Staff of FDR - '''19 Aug 45''' in The Washington Times and The Tribune).
Reading related documents and especially the diaries of US major figures (Truman, Stimson, Byrnes, Grew, Forrestal, etc...) should bring some light into this old misconception of &quot;no surrender&quot;.

:Your points are well-taken, but they probably belong in the article discussing the Japanese surrender (which can be accessed thru the Wiki WW2 article, or under History of Japan, etc). The point here is that I-52 almost certainly had nothing to do w/ Japanese overtures to the USA regarding a peace proposal.

== Recordings ==

So if Taylor dropped first, and they believe that he sank the I-52 with his FIDO, and Gordon arrived later and dropped a FIDO after hearing a German sub 20 miles away, then how come the recordings from Gordons plane contain the sound of a torpedo exploding and metal twisting? He didn't hit the German sub, so he must have hit something. If the I-52 was already sunk by Taylor, then what did Gordon hit and what is in that recording?[[User:.45Colt|.45Colt]] 00:51, 4 April 2014 (UTC)</text>
