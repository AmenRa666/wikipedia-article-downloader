The '''French destroyer ''Chacal''''' was the [[name ship]] of [[Chacal-class destroyer|her class]] of [[destroyer]]s (''contre-torpilleur'') built for the [[French Navy]] during the 1920s. Initially assigned to the [[Mediterranean Squadron (France)|Mediterranean Squadron]], she spent most of the following decade as a [[training ship]]. The ship was assigned convoy escort duties in the Atlantic after the start of World War II in September 1939 until she was committed to the [[English Channel]] after the [[Battle of France]] began in May 1940. ''Chacal'' was crippled by German bombers and artillery on 23/24 May and had to [[Beaching (nautical)|beach]] herself near [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]].

==Design and description==
The ''Chacal''-class ships were designed to counter the large Italian {{sclass-|Leone|destroyer|2}}s. They had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|126.8|m|ftin|sp=us}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|11.1|m|ftin|sp=us}},&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Moulin, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.1|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The ships displaced {{convert|2126|t|LT|sp=us}} at [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard]]&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|2980|-|3075|t|LT|sp=us}} at [[deep load]]. They were powered by two geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]], using steam provided by five [[du Temple boiler]]s. The turbines were designed to produce {{convert|50000|PS|kW shp|lk=on|sp=us}}, which would propel the ship at {{convert|35.5|kn|link=in}}. During her [[sea trial]]s on 18 May 1926, ''Chacal''{{'}}s turbines provided {{convert|54911|PS|kW shp}} and she reached {{convert|35.3|kn}} for a single hour. The ships carried {{convert|530|t|LT|0|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]] which gave them a range of {{convert|3000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}. Their crew consisted of 10 officers and 187 crewmen in peacetime and 12 officers and 209 enlisted men in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Moulin, pp. 18, 22–27, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The main armament of the ''Chacal''-class ships consisted of five [[Canon de 130 mm modèle 1919]] guns in single mounts, one [[superfiring]] pair fore and aft of the superstructure and the fifth gun [[abaft]] the aft [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]. The guns were numbered '1' to '5' from front to rear. Their [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament consisted of two [[Canon de 75 mm modèle 1924]] guns in single mounts positioned [[amidships]]. The ships carried two above-water triple sets of {{convert|550|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s. A pair of [[depth charge]] chutes were built into their stern; these housed a total of twenty {{convert|200|kg|sp=us|adj=on}} depth charges. They were also fitted with four depth-charge throwers for which they carried a dozen {{convert|100|kg|sp=us|adj=on}} depth charges.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Moulin, pp. 27–33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Chacal'', named after the [[jackal]], was ordered on 26 February 1923 from the ''[[Ateliers et Chantiers de Saint-Nazaire Penhoët]]''. She was [[laid down]] on 18 September 1923 at their [[shipyard]] in [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 September 1924, [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 May 1926, completed on 28 July and entered service on 23 December. Completion was delayed by problems with her propulsion machinery and late deliveries by sub-contractors. Even before she was formally completed, she participated in two [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] cruises in mid-1926 and made another cruise in the Eastern Atlantic in November–December. ''Chacal'' was assigned to the 1st Large Destroyer Division (''1ère division de contre-torpeilleurs'') (DCT) of the Mediterranean Squadron (renamed 5th Light Division (''Division légère'') (DL) of the First Squadron (''1ère Escadre'') on 1 February 1927) based at [[Military port of Toulon|Toulon]] upon completion, together with her [[sister ship]]s {{ship|French destroyer|Panthère||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Tigre||2}}. On 27 April 1927, the ship participated in a naval review by [[Gaston Doumergue]], [[President of France]], off [[Marseilles]]. The following month, she was one of the ships that escorted Doumergue across the [[English Channel]] during his state visit to Britain in May–June 1927. The ship was present when he next reviewed the fleet on 3 July 1928 off [[Le Havre]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Moulin, pp. 20–21, 209–11, 213–14&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chacal'' and ''Tigre'' escorted the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Primauguet||2}} to [[French West Africa]] between 13 January and 10 April 1931. The four depth charge throwers were removed from ''Chacal'' in 1932 and the ship was briefly assigned to the 9th DL of the Torpedo Training School (''Ecole d'application du lancement à la mer'') at Toulon on 1 October until she was relieved of that assignment the following year. About a year later, the 75-millimeter guns were replaced by four twin mounts for [[Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|adj=on|1|sp=us}}]] [[anti-aircraft machinegun]]s. On 15 July 1935, ''Chacal'' and her sister {{ship|French destroyer|Léopard||2}} of the 8th DL were assigned to the Naval School (''Ecole Navale'') at [[Brest, France|Brest]]. On 12 April 1937, the 8th DL was redesignated as the 2nd DCT; their sister {{ship|French destroyer|Jaguar||2}} joined them in September.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Moulin, pp. 38–39, 210, 217&lt;/ref&gt;

By 7 September 1939, ''Chacal'' was no longer a part of the 2nd DCT and was assigned  to the Western Command (''Forces maritimes de l'Ouest'') for convoy escort duties from October to May 1940 where she guarded convoys traveling between [[Gibraltar]] and Brest as well as [[Casablanca]], [[French Morocco]], and [[Le Verdon-sur-Mer]]. In November, the ship had a British Type 123 [[ASDIC]] installed; in addition two depth-charge throwers were reinstalled, No. 3 gun removed, and her depth charge stowage reduced to a dozen 200&amp;nbsp;kg and eight 100&amp;nbsp;kg depth charges to improve her stability.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Moulin, pp. 39, 225, 227–28&lt;/ref&gt;

By 22 May ''Chacal'' was reassigned to the 2nd DCT when the unit was tasked to carry demolition teams to the northernmost French ports; the ship arrived at Calais that evening.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Moulin, pp. 227–28&lt;/ref&gt; Together with ''Léopard'' and eight smaller destroyers, ''Chacal'' bombarded advancing German troops as they approached the defenses of Boulogne-sur-Mer throughout the 23rd.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; During the night of 23–24 May, the ship was badly damaged by bombs from [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers and shells from German artillery and had to be beached between [[Ambleteuse]] and [[Wimereux]] lest she sink.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Moulin, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;
