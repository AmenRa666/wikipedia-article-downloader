'''SMS ''Albatross'''''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;SMS&quot; stands for &quot;Seiner Majestät Schiff&quot;, or &quot;His Majesty's Ship&quot; in German.&lt;/ref&gt; was a German [[Minelayer|minelaying]] [[cruiser]] built for the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial  Navy), the second and final member of the {{sclass-|Nautilus|minelayer|4}}. Her [[keel]] was laid down in May 1907 at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard; she was launched in October and commissioned into the fleet in May 1908. Her armament consisted of eight {{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} guns and 288&amp;nbsp;[[naval mine]]s.

Her peacetime career consisted of conducting fleet training exercises and serving as a mine warfare [[training ship]]. After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in July 1914, ''Albatross'' laid several offensive and defensive minefields in the [[North Sea]]. She was assigned to the [[Baltic Sea]] in 1915, and began a series of operations to block Russian naval operations in the eastern Baltic. These culminated in the [[Battle of Åland Islands]] on 2 July, where a group of Russian [[armored cruiser]]s surprised ''Albatross'' and the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Augsburg||2}} after they had laid a minefield off the Åland Islands. ''Albatross'' was badly damaged in the battle and forced to beach off the island of [[Gotland]] in neutral Sweden. The ship was refloated by the Swedes later that month and interned for the remainder of the war, along with her crew. She was returned to Germany in January 1919, was sold for scrap, and [[ship breaking|broken up]] in [[Hamburg]].

== Design ==
{{main|Nautilus-class minelayer}}
[[File:SMS Albatross.jpg|thumb|left|Model at Deutsches Marinemuseum, Wilhelmshaven]]

''Albatross'' was {{convert|100.9|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|11.5|m|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.4|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|2208|MT|sp=us}} normally and up to {{convert|2506|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} at full load. Her crew numbered 10 officers and 191&amp;nbsp;enlisted men.&lt;ref name=G169&gt;Gröner, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Her propulsion system consisted of two [[triple-expansion engine|triple-expansion]] [[steam engine]]s each driving a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by four coal-fired marine-type [[boiler]]s. The ship's engines were rated to produce a top speed of {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|6600|PS|ihp kW|abbr=on|lk=on|-1}}, though ''Albatross'' slightly exceeded those figures on speed trials. She had a cruising radius of {{convert|3530|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|9|kn}}.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt;

The primary armament for ''Albatross'' was a battery of eight {{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} SK L/35 guns in individual mounts. Two were placed side by side on the [[forecastle]], four were placed on the [[superstructure]] [[amidships]], with two on each [[broadside]], and the last two were mounted side by side at the stern.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, &quot;SK&quot; (Schnelladekanone) denotes that the gun is quick loading, while the L/45 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/45 gun is 45 [[Calibers#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 45 times long as its diameter.&lt;/ref&gt; She carried 288&amp;nbsp;[[naval mine]]s.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt;

== Service history ==
''Albatross'' was built by the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]]; her [[keel]] was [[keel laying|laid down]] as &quot;mine steamer B&quot; on 24 May 1907, and her completed [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched as ''Albatross'' just five months later on 23 October. After completing [[fitting-out]] work, the ship was commissioned for [[sea trials]] on 19 May 1908, which lasted until 25 July.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, pp. 210&amp;ndash;211&lt;/ref&gt; She spent the rest of the year in the minesweeping unit while the older minelayer {{SMS|Pelikan||2}} was undergoing a major [[:wikt:overhaul|overhaul]]. ''Albatross'' took part in the annual fleet maneuvers in August and September. On 26 October, she became a mine warfare [[training ship]], and she was based in [[Cuxhaven]]. The following year followed a similar pattern.&lt;ref name=HRS211&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1910, ''Albatross'' went into drydock at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel for modernization that included moving the mine-launching equipment to the upper deck. The work lasted into 1911.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt; After she returned to service, ''Albatross'' resumed her duties with the mine training school. In 1911, she accidentally rammed the [[DDG Hansa]] steamer {{SS|Wartburg||2}} damaging her hull and necessitating repairs that took three weeks to complete. From late August to the end of September, ''Albatross'' operated in the [[Baltic Sea]]. For ''Albatross'', 1912, 1913, and the first half of 1914 passed uneventfully, in the same routine as her first three years in service.&lt;ref name=HRS211/&gt;

===World War I===
After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in July 1914, ''Albatross'' was classified as a mine cruiser.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt; She was temporarily sent to the Baltic Sea to lay defensive minefields against a possible attack by the Russian [[Baltic Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldrick, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; In late August, ''Albatross'' and her [[sister ship]] {{SMS|Nautilus||2}} were sent to lay a minefield off the [[Humber]] and the [[River Tyne]]. The two minelayers proceeded independently, and were each covered by a [[light cruiser]] and half-flotilla of [[destroyer]]s. ''Albatross''{{'}}s group, which included the cruiser {{SMS|Stuttgart||2}}, departed from [[Helgoland]] early on the morning of 25 August. After arriving, ''Albatross'' laid a single mine field that was {{convert|11|nmi|abbr=on}} long, though she had laid the field to the northwest of the intended location, owing to heavy fog. On the way back to port, the German vessels sank six British fishing vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldrick, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1915, ''Albatross'' was transferred to the Baltic, along with the auxiliary minelayer {{SMS|Deutschland|1914|2}}. ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (Rear Admiral) [[Albert Hopman]] intended to lay a series of offensive minefields to prevent the Baltic Fleet from sortieing to attack German ports. ''Albatross'' conducted her first minelaying operation, codenamed V, on 20 June. Escorted by the [[armored cruiser]]s {{SMS|Roon||2}}, {{SMS|Prinz Heinrich||2}}, and {{SMS|Prinz Adalbert||2}} and the light cruisers {{SMS|Augsburg||2}} and {{SMS|Lübeck||2}}, ''Albatross'' laid a minefield off the island of [[Bogskär]]. The operation was completed and the ships returned to [[Neufahrwasser]] on 22 June. Three days later, ''Albatross'', laden with 350 mines, sortied with ''Prinz Adalbert'', ''Prinz Heinrich'', and the light cruiser {{SMS|Thetis||2}} to lay another minefield in operation VI. The four ships were screened by eight [[torpedo boat]]s from X Flotilla. The ships completed the operation and returned to Neufahrwasser at 23:00 on 26 June.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. 106&amp;ndash;107&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Åland Islands====
{{main|Battle of Åland Islands}}
The next operation, VII, began on the night of 30 June, when ''Albatross'', ''Roon'', and five torpedo boats steamed out of the [[Vistula River]]; they were met the following morning by ''Augsburg''&amp;mdash;the [[flagship]] of ''[[Kommodore]]'' (Commodore) [[Johannes von Karpf]]&amp;mdash;''Lübeck'', and two more torpedo boats. ''Albatross'' was to lay another minefield off Bogskär. Later that day, ''Roon'', ''Lübeck'', and two torpedo boats separated from the rest of the flotilla to guard a channel between German minefields, while ''Albatross'' and the rest of the ships continued north to Bogskär. That evening, ''Albatross'' laid a field of 160&amp;nbsp;mines, after which she and ''Augsburg'' turned back south and rendezvoused with ''Roon'' and ''Lübeck''. Karpf then issued via [[wireless]] a report to headquarters that gave his position, speed, and bearing. This message was intercepted and decrypted by the Russians; coincidentally, the Russian fleet had planned an operation to bombard [[Klaipėda|Memel]] the following day, and several cruises had put to sea on 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. 108&amp;ndash;110&lt;/ref&gt;

Four Russian armored cruisers, with the powerful armored cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rurik|1906|2}} steaming in support, attempted to ambush the German squadron after receiving word of the intercepted message. Karpf dispersed his force shortly before encountering the Russians; ''Albatross'', ''Augsburg'', and three torpedo boats steamed to [[Rixhöft]] while the remainder went to Libau. Shortly after 06:30 on 2 July, lookouts on ''Augsburg'' spotted the Russian force; Karpf ordered the slower ''Albatross'' to seek refuge in neutral Swedish waters, while ''Augsburg'' and the torpedo boats used their high speed to escape the Russians and attempting to recall ''Roon'' and ''Lübeck''.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian cruisers turned to port to bring their batteries to bear, and opened fire at a range of {{convert|8000|m|abbr=on}}; the cruisers {{ship|Russian cruiser|Bogatyr||2}} and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Oleg||2}} engaged ''Albatross''. Heavy fog masked the Russian ships to the German gunners, preventing them from being able to return effective fire.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S61670, Gestrandeter Minenkreuzer SMS Albatros.jpg|thumb|''Albatross'' beached after the battle]]

Karpf ordered the slow ''Albatross'' to make for neutral Swedish waters, where theoretically she would be protected from the Russian attack, while he tried to escape with ''Augsburg'' to the south. Soon, all four Russian cruisers were firing at ''Albatross'', allowing ''Augsburg'' and the torpedo boats to escape freely. At 07:20, ''Albatross'' was hit for the first time. As the range closed, the Russian ships came close enough that ''Albatross'' could reply with her 8.8&amp;nbsp;guns, but by this time the Russian fire was beginning to take its toll. The forecastle was riddled with holes, the foremast was knocked down, and the [[conning tower]] was destroyed, killing the men inside. At 07:45, ''Albatross'' entered Swedish territorial waters, but the Russians continued firing for another twenty minutes, checking their fire only at 08:07 after the ship had [[Östergarn]] Sound. By this time, the ship was badly damaged and was listing heavily to port. Fearing that the ship would capsize, her captain ordered her to be beached.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. 114&amp;ndash;116&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the battle, ''Augsburg'' had been hit by six {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} and twenty {{convert|6|in|adj=on}} shells. One officer and 26 enlisted men were killed. In return, the ship scored a single hit on {{ship|Russian cruiser|Bayan|1907|2}}, with the shell splinters damaging a {{convert|7.5|cm|abbr=on}} gun and wounding one man.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Hopman considered sending a torpedo boat to try to pull ''Albatross'' free, but the threat of Russian vessels in the area led him to abandon the idea. Instead, he sortied with ''Prinz Adalbert'' and ''Prinz Heinrich'', intending to reinforce Karpf's ships and then to rescue ''Albatross''. While he was en route, the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|E9}} torpedoed ''Prinz Adalbert'', badly damaging her and forcing Hopman to break off the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. 121&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to free herself and with no rescue operation forthcoming, ''Albatross'' was interned by Sweden for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of the fatalities, 26 of the German sailors were buried the same evening the battle was fought in a mass grave just east of [[Östergarn Church]]. One crew had fallen overboard and could not be found. Two of the crew members who died during transportation to [[Roma, Gotland|Roma]] were buried at [[Björke Church|Björke cemetery]]. The surviving German crew were interned, first in Roma, then at [[Blåhäll]] in [[Tofta, Gotland|Tofta]].&lt;ref&gt;Öhrman, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish salvage company Neptun refloated ''Albatross'' on 23 July and towed her to [[Fårösund]] before proceeding to [[Oskarshamn]], where she was interned for the duration of the war. Sweden returned ''Albatross'' and her crew to Kiel in January 1919; there, she was formally decommissioned on 23 January. On 21 March, she was stricken from the [[naval register]] and thereafter sold for 900,000&amp;nbsp;marks and [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=G169/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;
