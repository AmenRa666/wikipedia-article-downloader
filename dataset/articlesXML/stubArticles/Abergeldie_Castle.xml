'''Abergeldie Castle''' is a four-floor [[Tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]] located in [[Crathie]] and Braemar parish, SW  [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]]. It stands at an altitude of {{convert|840|ft|m}}, on the south bank of the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|River Dee]], {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} west of Ballater, and about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} east of the royal residence of Balmoral Castle.  Behind it rises Creag nam Ban, a rounded granite hill about {{convert|527|m|ft}} high, and across the river to its front is the cairn-crowned [[Geallaig Hill]], rising to {{convert|743|m|ft}}.

It is protected as a category A [[listed building]].&lt;ref name=lbr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=3005 |title=Abergeldie Castle: Listed Building Report |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle is the home of [[Barons in Scotland|Baron Abergeldie]].

==History==

The name derives from the [[Pictish]] language, and means the &quot;Confluence of Geldie.&quot;

(Note: attempts have been made to derive the name from Scottish Gaelic, such as &quot;inbhir-gile&quot; [&quot;shining {or bright} confluence&quot;], but while aber and inbhir both mean &quot;confluence&quot; the former is derived from Pictish, a P-Celtic [Brythonic] language which once dominated in Britain,  while the latter is derived from Gaelic, a Q-Celtic [Goidelic] language, originating in Ireland. Since Abergeldie is in the heartland of the ancient Pictish realm, and is surrounded by other place names incorporating &quot;aber&quot; [including nearby Aberdeen], it is safe to assume that Pictish is the correct origin of the name.)

A late Bronze Age standing stone, about 6.5 feet high, 2.5 feet wide, and 1.25 feet thick on the lawn of the castle is one indicator of the great antiquity of this site, and its long occupation by man.  It also has one of the longest unbroken records of ownership, being in the hands of the Gordon family for 600 years.
 
It was most likely built around 1550&lt;ref name=lbr/&gt; by Sir Alexander Gordon of [[Midmar Castle|Midmar]], son of the first Earl of Huntly, on grounds acquired by the Gordon family in 1482. The interior has been returned to its original state, restored by a descendant of the builder.

During the course of the [[Jacobite Risings|first Jacobite rising]] in 1689-90, the castle was besieged by Jacobite forces.  However, following the defeat of General Buchan's Jacobite forces by Sir Thomas Livingstone at [[Cromdale]] on 1 May 1690,  General [[Hugh Mackay (general)|Hugh Mackay of Scourie]] marched with some cavalry and 1,400 Williamite Dutch infantry (probably including his own former regiment) to lift the siege.

It figured again in the 1715 Jacobite Rising, being garrisoned by government troops (having then only recently been renovated by Rachel Gordon, 10th Heiress, and her husband, Captain Charles Gordon, who had also built nearby [[Birkhall]], later sold to the current royal family), and again in the short 1719 Rising, when it was briefly garrisoned by Spanish troops. 
 
In 1848 Prince Albert, Victoria's Consort, purchased the lease of the Abergeldie estate for 40 years, as Abergeldie was relatively close to the new royal Scottish residence of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]].

Birkhall, with an estate of 6,500 acres was bought from the Gordons by Albert the Queen’s Consort about the same time (though there has long been a local rumour that the Laird lost Birkhall in a card game).

Albert loaned the property to his son Albert Edward (known by his family and intimates as &quot;Bertie&quot;), then the Prince of Wales (and future Edward VII). However, Queen Victoria claimed it back in 1885, possibly because of Edward's penchant for leading a dissolute life. After his marriage in 1863, he stayed every year at Abergeldie, indulging his twin passions of shooting by day and card-games by night. According to an entry in [[William Ewart Gladstone|W. E. Gladstone's]] 1871 diary, Albert Edward one night asked Gladstone to drive over from Balmoral to dine. Gladstone was charmed by his manner, but not his gaming morals.

[[File:S. 7 Abergeldie (&quot;Cruise of the &quot;Nereid&quot; 1869&quot;) (7779752250).jpg|thumb|250px|The castle in 1869]]
The  Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland: A Survey of Scottish Topography, Statistical, Biographical and  Historical&quot; edited by Francis H. Groome, published 1882-1885&lt;/ref&gt; mentions that the Duchess of Kent spent several autumns here between 1850 and  1861, and that the [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] passed the October there following the loss of her son the [[Prince Imperial]] (1879), and that it was used as a summer residence and shooting box for the then Prince of Wales (who became Edward VII).

Other members of the royal family who stayed at Abergeldie included the daughters of Edward VII, Princesses Louise, Victoria and Maud of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toria and sisters|url=http://www.gogmsite.net/the-belle-epoque-1890-1914/subalbum-princess-victoria-/toria-and-sisters-wearing-c.html|publisher=Grand ladies: the Belle Epoque}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birkhall remains in the royal family's possession. Charles, the current Prince of Wales and heir, spends time there with his consort, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. (In Scotland she uses her title as [[Duchess of Rothesay]].)
 
Abergeldie Castle is at present is occupied by the 21st [[Laird]], John Seton Howard Gordon, Baron of Abergeldie, who has been living there since 1972 (the lands having been previously on lease to the royal family's Balmoral estate, who had their lease on the game lands renewed in the year 2000).

In January 2016, the castle was threatened by rising flood waters from the River Dee, which washed away much of the land behind the building, leaving it on a precipice over the river, thus forcing the 76-year-old Baron Abergeldie to flee. For a time, authorities were uncertain if the castle could be saved if the flooding continued.&lt;ref name=GuardJan16&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/04/abergeldie-castle-queen-neighbour-balmoral-flee-floods|title=Queen's neighbours at historic Scottish castle forced to flee floods|author=Jessica Elgot|date=4 January 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, structural engineers were confident that shoring efforts would prevent imminent collapse.&lt;ref name=NatScot6Jan16&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/abergeldie-castle-saved-from-collapse.11987|title=Abergeldie Castle saved from collapse|author=James Hamilton|date=6 January 2016|work=The National|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Johnson: [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/flooding/12081476/Queens-neighbours-castle-overhanging-12ft-drop-to-river.html Queen's neighbour's castle 'overhanging 12ft drop to river']. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 5 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==The castle==
The castle is an imposing building, its oldest part being a turreted square block-tower of the &quot;tower house&quot; type, with rectangular-plan tower measuring around {{convert|35|by|28|ft}}, with a round stair tower {{convert|15|ft}} across at the south-west corner. The walls are 4 feet thick, as was common for the unsettled nature of the times.  Tradition suggests that the castle was originally surrounded by a moat, but no trace exists today. In the 18th century a wing was added to the 16th century structure.&lt;ref name=rcahms&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/31138/details/abergeldie+castle/ |title=Abergeldie Castle |work=[[CANMORE]] |publisher=[[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]] |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century an [[ogee]]-roofed belfry was built at the top of the stair tower, and a [[Venetian window]] inserted in the south façade.&lt;ref name=lbr/&gt; [[W. D. Simpson]] noted similarities between Abergeldie and the Castle of Balfluig at [[Alford, Aberdeenshire|Alford]], suggesting that they may have shared a designer.&lt;ref name=rcahms/&gt;

The estate grounds extend 10 miles along Deeside, and consist of 11,700 acres planted with Scotch pine, larch, and birch, mixed in the private grounds with spruce, ash, plane, and sycamore.

==Ghost==
 
The castle is said to be haunted by the spirit of a French serving woman named Catherine (or Kittie) Rankie (or Frankie), also known as French Kate. She was accused of being a witch, and was imprisoned in the cellars before being burned at the stake on nearby Craig-na-Ban (Gaelic Creag-na-Ban - Rock of the Women), which overlooks the castle. Since that time, Kate's ghost has been said to have been seen in the cellars and in the clock tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/scotland-s-specters-haunted-castles-part-1-1-2280035 |title=Scotland’s specters: Haunted castles, part 1 - Heritage |publisher=Scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
