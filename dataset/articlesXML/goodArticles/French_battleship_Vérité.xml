'''''Vérité''''' was a [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]] of the [[Liberté-class battleship|''Liberté'' class]] built by the [[French Navy]]. She had three [[sister ship]]s: [[French battleship Liberté|''Liberté'']], [[French battleship Justice|''Justice'']], and [[French battleship Démocratie|''Démocratie'']]. ''Vérité'' was laid down in April 1903, launched in May 1907, and completed in June 1908, over a year after the revolutionary British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} made ships like ''Vérité'' obsolete. She was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} guns, compared to the ten guns of the same caliber mounted on ''Dreadnought''.

''Vérité'' took the French President on a goodwill trip to Russia in 1908 and visited America in September 1909. In September 1911, she was damaged by the explosion that destroyed her sister ''Liberté'' in [[Toulon]]. At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, she covered troop convoys from North Africa to France along with the rest of the French Mediterranean Fleet. She spent the rest of the war based at [[Corfu]] and later [[Mudros]], without seeing any action at either location. After the end of the war, she was stricken from the [[naval register]] and broken up for scrap in 1922.

''Vérité'' was laid down at the ''[[Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde]]'' shipyard in [[Bordeaux]] in April 1903, launched on 28 May 1907, and completed in June 1908,&lt;ref name=G297&gt;Gardiner, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; over a year after the radically innovative British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, which rendered the [[pre-dreadnought]]s like ''Vérité'' outdated before they were completed.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was {{convert|133.81|m|sp=us|ftin}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.26|m|abbr=on|ftin}} and a full-load [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.41|m|abbr=on|ftin}}. She displaced up to {{convert|14489|MT|sp=us}} at full load. The ship had a crew of between 739 and 769 officers and enlisted men. ''Vérité'' was powered by three vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s with twenty-two [[Belleville boiler]]s. They were rated at {{convert|18500|ihp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}. Coal storage amounted to {{convert|1800|MT|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;

''Vérité''{{'}}s main battery consisted of four [[Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893/96 gun]]s mounted in two twin [[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of ten [[Canon de 194 mm Modèle 1902]] guns; six were mounted in single turrets, and four in [[casemate]]s in the hull. She also carried thirteen 9-pounder guns and ten 3-pounders. Additionally, the ship was armed with two {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in the hull. The ship's [[belt armor|main belt]] was {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick and the main battery was protected by up to {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on|1}} of armor. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;

== Service history ==
''Vérité''{{'}}s first major assignment was received in late July 1908, a month after she joined the French fleet. She carried the [[President of France]] [[Armand Fallières]] to [[Reval]], Russia, arriving on 27 July. There, Fallières visited with the Russian Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], who inspected ''Vérité''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; She joined [[French battleship Liberté|''Liberté'']] and [[French battleship Justice|''Justice'']] for a visit to the United States for the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] in September 1909. The three ships, representing France during the celebrations and commanded by Admiral Jules le Pord, were the first foreign ships to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;Levine &amp; Panetta, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The ships departed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] and reached New York seven days later, having run at an average of {{convert|16|kn}}; the performance of the ships' propulsion systems was regarded as satisfactory by contemporary naval experts, including the [[United States Naval Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Alger, p. 1415&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1911, the French Navy conducted experiments with [[wireless telegraphy]], and used ''Vérité'' and ''Justice'' for the tests. The wireless transmitters could pick up messages as far as {{convert|72|mi}} away.&lt;ref&gt;Alger, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September 1911, ''Liberté'' was destroyed by an accidental explosion in [[Toulon]], the result of the spontaneous combustion of [[nitrocellulose]] gel in her ammunition magazines.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt; Debris hurled by the explosion damaged several nearby battleships, including ''Vérité''.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 653&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Verite-3 Bougault.jpg|thumb|left|''Vérité'' in harbor during peacetime]]

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, ''Vérité'' was assigned to the 1st Division of the 2nd Squadron in the [[Mediterranean]], along with [[French battleship République|''République'']] and [[French battleship Patrie|''Patrie'']].&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; The French fleet was initially used to cover the movement of French troops—the [[19th Army Corps (France)|XIX Corps]]—from Algeria to metropolitan France. As a result, the fleet was far out of position to catch the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}}, which, contrary to French expectations, steamed to [[Constantinople]] rather than attempt to interfere with the troop transports.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (1995), pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; For the majority of the war, the French used their main fleet to keep the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian fleet]] bottled up in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In 1914 she participated in the [[Battle of Antivari]], where the [[line of battle|battle line]] caught the Austro-Hungarian cruiser {{SMS|Zenta}} by surprise and sank her. The French battleships then bombarded Austrian fortifications at [[Kotor|Cattaro]] in an attempt to draw out the Austro-Hungarian fleet, which refused to take the bait.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (2004), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The French operations in the area were hampered by a lack of a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic; the British had given the French free access to [[Malta]], but it was hundreds of miles away. The Austrians also possessed several [[submarine]]s, [[SM U-12 (Austria-Hungary)|one of which]] torpedoed the [[dreadnought]] [[French battleship Jean Bart (1911)|''Jean Bart'']] in December 1914. The threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (2004), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, the French eventually settled on [[Corfu]] as their primary naval base in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (2004), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the war, ''Vérité'' was sent to [[Mudros]] along with her sister ships.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war, ''Vérité'' was stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1922 and subsequently broken up for scrap.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;
