IN MEMORY OF
COLONEL SIR HENRY WALTON ELLIS K.C.B.,
A NATIVE OF THIS CITY,
WHO, AT AN EARLY AGE, ENTERED THE 23RD REGIMENT OR ROYAL WELCH FUSILIERS,
THEN COMMANDED BY HIS FATHER, MAJOR-GENERAL JOHN JOYNER ELLIS,
AND AFTERWARDS LED ON TO HONOURABLE DISTINCTION BY HIMSELF, DURING SEVEN YEARS OF UNEXAMPLED MILITARY RENOWN
HAVING RECEIVED EIGHT WOUNDS, AND RENDERED SERVICES AS IMPORTANT AS THEY WERE BRILLIANT,
IN HOLLAND, EGYPT, THE WEST-INDIES, AMERICA, SPAIN, PORTUGAL, AND FRANCE,
HE FELL BY A MUSKET-SHOT, AT THE HEAD OF HIS REGIMENT, ALMOST IN THE GLORIOUS MOMENT
WHICH ANNOUNCED VICTORY TO GREAT-BRITAIN, AND PEACE TO EUROPE, ON THE MEMORABLE PLAINS OF

WATERLOO.

HE DIED OF HIS WOUND, ON THE 20TH OF JUNE 1815, AGED 32 YEARS
HIS LOSS WAS LAMENTED, AND HIS WORTH RECORDED BY HIS ILLUSTRIOUS COMMANDER

WELLINGTON,

IN WORDS THAT WILL PERISH ONLY WITH HISTORY ITSELF!
____________________________________

THIS MONUMENT WAS ERECTED
BY THE OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND PRIVATES OF THE ROYAL WELCH FUSILIERS,
AS A TRIBUTE OF THEIR RESPECT AND AFFECTION TO THE MEMORY OF A LEADER,
NOT MORE DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS VALOUR AND CONDUCT IN THE FIELD,
THAN BELOVED FOR EVERY GENEROUS AND SOCIAL VIRTUE.

== Subject? ==

This article seems to jump around as to who it's actually about.  Would suggest reorganizing it to keep one person's life --as much as possible--separate from another's.--[[User:Piledhigheranddeeper|Piledhigheranddeeper]] ([[User talk:Piledhigheranddeeper|talk]]) 16:32, 23 May 2011 (UTC)
