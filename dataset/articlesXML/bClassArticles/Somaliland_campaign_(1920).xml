The '''Fifth Expedition of the [[Somaliland campaign]] in 1920''' was the final [[British Empire|British]] expedition against the [[Dervish State|Dervish]] forces of [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (often called the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot; derogatorily by British ), the [[Somali people|Somali]] religious leader. Although the majority of the combat took place in January of the year, British troops had begun preparations for the assault as early as November 1919. The British forces included elements of the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]]. After three weeks of battle, Hassan's Dervishes were defeated, bringing an effective end to their 20 year resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=From Biplane to Spitfire |last=Baker |first=Anne |authorlink=Anne Baker (author) |year=2003 |publisher=[[Pen And Sword Books]] |isbn=0-85052-980-8 |pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The British had previously conducted [[Somaliland Campaign|three expeditions to British Somaliland]] against Hassan and his forces from 1900 to 1904 with limited or no success. In 1913, the Dervishes had previously defeated British forces at the [[Dul Madoba|Battle of Dul Madoba]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Baker&quot;/&gt;  Following the end of [[World War I]], the British once again turned their attention to the ongoing violence in [[British Somaliland]].

==British plans==
In 1919, the unrest in British Somaliland alarmed the British Government enough for [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], to consider sending a military expedition to the protectorate. The [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Wilson]], advised Milner that at least two [[Division (military)|divisions]] would be required and this was likely to cost several million pounds.  Such a cost was seen as being prohibitively expensive in the conditions of post-war austerity.&lt;ref name = &quot;Baker&quot;/&gt;

Lord Milner then turned to the newly formed Royal Air Force, asking the [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Sir Hugh Trenchard]], if he could suggest a solution.  Trenchard who at that time was most eager to ensure that the air force remained as a separate service, immediately proposed that the RAF should take responsibility for the whole operation.&lt;ref name = &quot;Baker&quot;/&gt;  Milner argued that some ground troops would be needed and Trenchard replied that the local colonial forces which were already in Somaliland would be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyle |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Boyle |title=Trenchard Man of Vision |year=1962 |publisher=Collins |location= St. James's Place London |pages=366 to 367|chapter=Chapter 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meeting was arranged to discuss the coming campaign.  In attendance were: [[Winston Churchill]] who was [[Secretary of State for War]] and [[Secretary of State for Air|Air]], [[Leo Amery]] the Colonial Under-Secretary who deputized for Milner, Sir Henry Wilson and Sir Hugh Trenchard.  Wilson was strongly opposed to a campaign being conducted by the [[Colonial Office]] and the [[Air Ministry]] which would draw upon the [[War Office]]'s soldiers.  However, when Amery and Trenchard stated that under no circumstances would they request troops, Wilson withdrew his objection and consented to the RAF taking the lead.&lt;ref name = &quot;Baker&quot;/&gt;

==Order of battle==

By the January 1920, the following British forces were assembled:&lt;ref name=&quot;RAF History&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Air Publication 3003 – A Brief History of the Royal Air Force |editor=Finn, C.

==Actions==
[[File:Taleh Castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]]'s fort in Taleh.]]
By 1 January 1920 the Z Force had constructed a temporary aerodrome at [[Berbera]] from where they operated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dean&quot;/&gt;  On 21 January RAF aircraft bombed Hassan's main base at [[Medistie]] and his fort at [[Jideli]].  Many members of Hassan's forces had never seen an aircraft before and were terrified by the aerial bombardment to the extent that they fled into the hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot;/&gt;  It was also during that first bombardment that Hassan came close to being killed, narrowly avoiding death when an unfortunate camel shielded him from a nearby bomb blast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dean&quot;/&gt;  After the next five days had passed the Z Force had destroyed three Dervish forts; they then provided air support and communications for the ground forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAF Museum&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/british_military/1920.html |title=British Military Aviation in 1920 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |work= RAF Museum Web Site |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070919025503/http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/british_military/1920.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This battle established the tactics of aerial bombardment followed by attacks by ground forces, and of using aircraft to provide support for ground troops during concurrent attacks.  These tactics are among the primary methods of wartime operations to this day.

On 28 January the Camel Corps occupied Jideli and Hassan retreated to his main fort at [[Taleh]].  After combined land and air operations, the British took Taleh on 9 February.  Hassan's forces suffered great losses and were scattered, his forts were damaged and he escaped with only four of his followers to the [[Ogaden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot;/&gt;

==Subsequent events==
Although in the following months Hassan did regain some power in Ogaden he was never a force in British Somaliland again.  He died of natural causes in December 1920.  Somaliland went on to enjoy 20 years of stability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot;/&gt;

In Great Britain, where the Mohammed Abdullah Hassan had long been a source of irritation, news of the swift victory was well received in Parliament and the country.  The cost of the 1920 operation was put at £77,000 and Amery described it as &quot;the cheapest war in history&quot;.  Trenchard and the newly established RAF were greatly encouraged by the outcome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot;/&gt;

The following year in March 1921 at the [[Cairo Conference (1921)|Cairo Conference]], Winston Churchill, who was by then Colonial Secretary, along with the three service chiefs, decided that all British forces in Iraq would be [[RAF Iraq Command|put under control of the RAF]].  The intention was to apply the model of imperial air control which had worked in Somaliland to a much larger region which was similarly troubled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dean&quot;/&gt;
