'''''Capitán Prat''''' was a unique ironclad [[battleship]] of the [[Chilean Navy]] built in the late 1880s and completed in 1890. Armed with a main battery of four {{convert|9.4|in|abbr=on}} guns in four single turrets, ''Capitán Prat'' was the first battleship in the world to be equipped with an electrical system. She was built in the [[Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée|La Seyne]] dockyard in France, and commissioned into the Chilean fleet in 1891. Foreign navies tried to purchase the ship twice before the outbreak of wars, including an American attempt in 1898 and a Japanese offer in 1903.

''Capitán Prat'' served in the fleet for about ten years, until she was disarmed in accordance with a treaty signed with Argentina intended to stop a naval arms race between the two countries. The ship returned to service, however, and remained on active duty with the fleet until 1926, when she was reduced to a coastal defense ship. In 1928&amp;ndash;1930, she was used as a [[submarine tender]], and in 1935, she was disarmed and used as a [[training ship]] for engineers. She remained in the Navy's inventory until 1942, when she was sold for scrap.

==Design==
[[File:Capitan Prat line-drawing.png|thumb|left|Line-drawing showing the disposition of the armament and the extent of the armored belt]]
''Capitán Prat'' was {{convert|328|ft}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a beam of {{convert|60|ft|8|in|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|6901|MT|sp=us}} and had a draft of {{convert|22|ft|10|in|abbr=on}}. Her hull was steel-built, with wood and [[copper sheathing]], and was equipped with a [[naval ram|ram bow]]. The ship mounted two masts, both with [[fighting top]]s. She had a crew of 480 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt;&lt;ref name=M86/&gt;

She was powered by a pair of horizontal expansion engines that were supplied with steam by five cylindrical boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels on the centerline. Her propulsion system was rated at {{convert|12000|ihp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|18.3|kn|abbr=on}}. She was designed to carry {{convert|400|MT|abbr=on}} of coal, though she could carry up to {{convert|1100|MT|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Conways&gt;Gardiner, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M86&gt;Miller, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first battleship of any navy to utilize electricity to power machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Ropp, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|9.4|in|abbr=on}}/35 [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns in single, electrically powered [[gun turret|turrets]]. One was placed forward, on the centerline, two were mounted [[amidships]], and the fourth was located aft of the [[superstructure]] on the centerline. Her secondary battery consisted of eight {{convert|4.7|in|abbr=on}} guns in four twin turrets; they were mounted on either side of the foremast and mainmast. Close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s was provided by a battery of six 6-pounder guns, four 3-pounder guns, and ten 1-pounder guns. She was also armed with four {{convert|18|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s in deck-mounted launchers. One was in the bow, another in the stern, and two on the broadside.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt;

The ship's armor consisted of [[Schneider Electric|Creusot]] steel. Her [[armored belt]] was {{convert|11.8|in|abbr=on}} thick amidships above the waterline, and {{convert|7.8|in|abbr=on}} below.  Above the waterline, the belt was reduced to {{convert|4.9|in|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|5.9|in|abbr=on}} aft. The belt was {{convert|3.9|in|abbr=on}} below the waterline, on either end of the ship. The belt extended for {{convert|2|ft|4|in|abbr=on}} above the waterline and {{convert|4|ft|7|in|abbr=on}} below. The citadel was {{convert|3.1|in|abbr=on}} thick and protected the ship's machinery spaces amidships. It extended to the upper deck and was closed on either ends by bulkheads {{convert|3.1|in|abbr=on}} thick. Outside the citadel, the deck was protected by {{convert|2|in|abbr=on}} thick armor. The [[barbette]]s for the main battery guns were {{convert|8|to|10.8|in|abbr=on}} thick, with {{convert|2|in|abbr=on}} thick hoods to protect the gun crews. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|10.5|in|abbr=on}} thick sides.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt;

==Service history==
On 22 August 1887, the [[National Congress of Chile]] passed a law authorizing the construction of new vessels to modernize the fleet. As part of this, they decided to order a new battleship from a foreign shipyard.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unidades&quot;&gt;&quot;Crucero Acorazado Capitán Prat (2do)&quot;, ''Unidades Navales''.&lt;/ref&gt; The contract for constructing the new Chilean battleship was advertized throughout the European shipyards, and was sought by British, German, and French shipbuilders.&lt;ref&gt;Ropp, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; The contract for ''Capitán Prat'' was awarded to the ''[[Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée]]'' shipyard in [[La Seyne]], France on 18 April 1889. The cost of the ship was agreed at £391,000,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; and she was laid down in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was launched on 20 December 1890, commissioned into the Chilean fleet in 1891, and arrived in Chile in May 1893.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt;&lt;ref name=M86/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unidades&quot;/&gt; ''Capitán Prat'' received favorable reviews from contemporary naval critics, as she was seen as a prime example of combining a high speed with good armament and armor protection.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chile,&quot; p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also heralded as &quot;the most powerful war ship possessed by any South American Government {{sic}} ... [and] any vessel at present in commission in the United States Navy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pride&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0915FD3D5415738DDDAC0994DC405B8485F0D3 |title=Pride of the Chilean Navy |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 April 1894 |subscription=yes |accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the ship helped begin [[Argentine–Chilean naval arms race|a naval arms race]] between Chile and Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''Capitán Prat'', the Chilean Navy ordered two new [[protected cruiser]]s and a pair of [[torpedo boat]]s. Argentina responded with the battleships {{ship|ARA|Independencia|1891|2}} and {{ship|ARA|Libertad|1890|2}}. The race continued through the 1890s, even after the expensive [[1891 Chilean Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, pp. 45–49, 297–98, 347&lt;/ref&gt; The race culminated in the orders for two [[armored cruiser]]s for the Argentine Navy and two {{sclass-|Constitución|battleship|2}}s for the Chilean Navy, though the latter two were purchased by the United Kingdom. The British, concerned over the possibility of war between the two countries, mediated an agreement, which resulted in the [[Pactos de Mayo]]. The treaty ended the expensive arms race and stipulated that both countries arrive at an agreement to balance their fleets. The latter led to the [[demilitarization]] of ''Capitán Prat'' and two Argentine armored cruisers, though all were later rearmed.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, pp. 49–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Treaty of Arbitration&quot;, 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ostasiengeschwader Graf Spee in Chile.jpg|thumb|right|The [[German East Asia Squadron]] in Valparaiso in November 1914; ''Capitán Prat'' is at extreme right]]
In March 1898, shortly before the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[US Navy]] attempted to purchase ''Capitán Prat'' to bolster its fleet for the coming conflict with Spain. The negotiations fell through, however, and the ship remained in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; By 1903, in the prelude to the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the Japanese government looked into purchasing ''Capitán Prat'' and the cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Izumi|''Esmeralda'']], along with other South American warships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C13FF3A5D16738DDDAE0A94DA415B838CF1D3 |title=Japan Wants More Ships |work=New York Times |date=27 December 1903 |accessdate=28 June 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Esmeralda'' was eventually purchased and commissioned into the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] as ''Izumi''.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt; By 1907, the ship was seen as outmoded in comparison to newer armored cruisers in the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, pp. 337–38.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909–1910, the ship was modernized, which included the installation of twelve new [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] [[watertube boiler]]s in place of the old cylindrical boilers, increasing the ship's top speed to {{convert|19.5|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. The height of her funnels was also increased.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unidades&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 1916, ''Capitán Prat'' suffered a magazine explosion while she was anchored in port in [[Valparaiso]]. Two cases of bad [[cordite]] [[propellant]] in the aft main battery magazine exploded. The construction of the ship, however, which provided a quick venting of the explosion, and defects in the propellant cases that allowed the explosive gasses to escape easily, saved the ship from destruction. The cordite was by that time 17 to 20 years old, about the maximum life-span of the propellant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/thist24.htm |title=Explosions in Warships During the War |author=Technical History Section, Admiralty |date=October 1919 |work=The Technical History and Index, Volume 2, Part 24 &quot;Storage and Handling of Explosives in Warships&quot; |publisher= |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1926, ''Capitán Prat'' was reduced to a coast defense ship. From 1928 to 1930, the ship was designated as a [[submarine tender]] for Chile's [[British H-class submarine|H]] and {{sclass-|Capitan O'Brien|submarine (1928)|0}} submarines. She was disarmed in 1935 to serve with the mechanical training school. The old battleship was ultimately sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unidades&quot;/&gt;
