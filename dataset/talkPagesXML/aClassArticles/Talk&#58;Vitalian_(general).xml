== DYK and birthplace ==

Hey Constantine, I saw the article on DYK and I'd be glad to review it. Date and length are okay of course, but there's some stuff I'd like you to elaborate on about the hook.

In the hook, you say it was a three-year revolt, and indeed, it lasted from 513 to 515. I could not locate in the article any hints as to when in 513 the rebellion started (I suppose this may be unknown). If that was towards the end of the year, then the rebellion would have lasted from late 513 to late 515 (the time of Vitalian's Constantinople battle), i.e. around two years. The duration would be a full three years only if the rebellion began in early 513. I suppose the quickest measure would be to reword the hook rather than dig for any details as to the start of the uprising.

Also, are there any details about the birthplace of Vitalian? A [http://www.google.bg/search?q=zaldaba+vitalian quick online check] seems to indicate that (mostly unreliable) Bulgarian sources are quick to identify Zaldaba (Zalbada?) with [[Shumen]].

:Hello Todor! The exact date of the uprising's start is not known, although it must have been in early 513, since the battles with Hypatius occurred in the autumn, and before that there was the descent to Constantinople etc. So roughly three years would be correct. IF necessary, I'll reword it. As for the identity of Zaldaba/Zalpada, it is mostly identified with Abrit [http://books.google.com/books?q=Abrit+zaldapa&amp;btnG=Search+Books]. [[User:Cplakidas|Constantine]]  [[User talk:Cplakidas| ✍ ]] 16:23, 18 January 2010 (UTC)
:: Thanks for the quick reply, Constantine! I'll accept your arguments and I'll leave it to you to decide as to whether to reword the hook. My personal persuasion is that the current wording is a bit inaccurate, as the uprising did not last for a full three years, and should be reworded at least slightly.
:: Indeed, reliable source seem to identify Zaldapa with the site near the confusingly-named modern village of Abrit in [[Dobrich Province]]. I'll take that.
:: Best and thanks for another quality article, ''[[User:TodorBozhinov|Todor]][[User_talk:TodorBozhinov|→]][[User:TodorBozhinov|Bozhinov]]'' 17:35, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

The result of the move request was: '''page moved''' per discussion and the fact that almost all of the inbound links were for Vitalian (general) and only a handful (3 or 4) where for either of the two old names that use consul. In addition this is supported by the opening sentence of the article and the contents of the infobox. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 19:03, 28 January 2010 (UTC)

----

[[:Vitalian (consul)]] → [[Vitalian (general)]] — his consulship is entirely irrelevant next to the fact that as a general he led the single biggest rebellion in 6th-century Byzantium, which is what he is chiefly known for. Alternatively, [[Vitalian (rebel)]] might be a possible solution. [[User:Cplakidas|Constantine]]  [[User talk:Cplakidas| ✍ ]] 00:47, 20 January 2010 (UTC)
::I believe the move of [[Vitalian (general)]] → [[Vitalian (consul)]] was made on the basis of [[WP:ROMANS]]. However, I think this might be an appropriate exception to the guidelines. --[[User:Labattblueboy|Labattblueboy]] ([[User talk:Labattblueboy|talk]]) 02:21, 20 January 2010 (UTC)
:::Hmm, well, the [[WP:ROMANS]] itself is IMO not applicable here. It is perfect for the Republic, where offices and the attending power structure were clear-cut, but completely useless for the Empire, at least in late Antiquity, when e.g. the consulship had become a honorary distinction of no real consequence. [[User:Cplakidas|Constantine]]  [[User talk:Cplakidas| ✍ ]] 02:48, 20 January 2010 (UTC)

::::I concur with Constantine, thinking that ''consul'' in this case is misleading, for most people that would search for him at WP would only have heard of him as a rebel leader. What's more, ''consul'' is likely to be associated with a much earlier period and there might even be other consuls of that name.
