'''Joseph R. &quot;Joe&quot; Pitts''' (born October 10, 1939) is the [[United States House of Representatives]] for {{ushr|PA|16}}, serving since 1997. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district is based in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] and [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] and includes much of [[Amish]] country. It also includes the far southwestern suburbs of [[Philadelphia]] in Chester County.

In December 2015, Congressman Pitts announced he was not running for reelection in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfmz.com/news/news-regional-berks/Local/Rep-Joe-Pitts-will-not-seek-re-election-to-Congress-in-2016/36300742|title=Rep. Joe Pitts will not seek re-election to Congress in 2016 |agency=69 News |work= WFMZ-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Pitts was born in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] and graduated from [[Asbury University|Asbury College]]. Pitts served five and a half years in the [[United States Air Force]], with three tours in [[Vietnam]]. Initially commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]], he was promoted to [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] by the time he left the service. He graduated second in his class from Navigator School, after which he was trained as an Electronic Warfare officer. As an EW officer, he served on [[B-52 Stratofortress]]es out of [[Westover Air Force Base]], [[Massachusetts]], with payloads of [[nuclear bomb]]s. In all, he completed 116 combat missions in the [[Vietnam War]] and earned an [[Air Medal]] with five [[oak leaf clusters]].

==Career==
After leaving the Air Force in 1969, Pitts moved to [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of Philadelphia and the hometown of his wife, Ginny. They built a house there, where they still live today.

Pitts was elected to the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] in 1972, representing Kennett Square and surrounding areas of Chester County.

====Elections====
After 10-term Republican congressman [[Robert Smith Walker|Bob Walker]] decided to retire in 1996, Pitts jumped into the crowded five-candidate Republican primary—the real contest in what has long been a strongly Republican district. He won the primary with 45% of the vote, defeating the second place candidate by 19 percentage points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=280264 |title=PA District 16 - R Primary Race - Apr 23, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general election, he defeated Democrat James G. Blaine 59%–38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=29753 |title=PA District 16 Race - Nov 05, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He won re-election easily in 1998 (71%), 2000 (67%), 2002 (88%), and 2004 (64%).

=====2006=====
{{see also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008#District 16}}
Pitts originally promised to serve only 10 years (five terms), but announced he would run again in 2006 amid considerable controversy. Despite the controversy, Pitts' won re-election to a sixth term, defeating Democrat businesswoman [[Lois Herr]] 57%–40%. The seventeen-point margin was the second smallest margin in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=207673 |title=PA - District 16 Race - Nov 07, 2006 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2008=====
{{see also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008#District 16}}
In 2008, Pitts decided to seek a seventh term. He was challenged by Navy veteran and construction contractor Bruce Slater. Pitts defeated him 56%–39%. The sixteen-point margin was the smallest margin in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=324566 |title=PA - District 16 Race - Nov 04, 2008 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2010=====
{{see also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010#District 16}}
Pitts was challenged by Democrat Lois Herr for a third rematch. He won re-election to an 8th term, defeating her 65%–35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=493140 |title=PA - District 16 Race - Nov 02, 2010 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2012=====
{{see also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012#District 16}}
Pitts was challenged by Democrat businesswoman [[Aryanna Strader]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strader for Congress|url=http://straderforcongress.org/|work=Strader for Congress|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Independent Jim Bednarski&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Bednarski for Congress, 16 District, PA|url=http://jimbednarski.com/|work=Jim Bednarski For Congress|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general election, Pitts won re-election to a ninth term, defeating Strader 55%–39%. The sixteen-point margin is tied for 2008 in being the smallest margin in his career. He lost in Berks County by 12,000 votes (35%) and won Chester County by only 500 votes (1%). He won Lancaster handily with over 60% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pennsylvania U.S. House District Race|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/PA/house/16|work=Elections &amp; Politics from CNN.com|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=751814 |title=PA - District 16 Race - Nov 06, 2012 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tenure====
Pitts has a very conservative voting record, which is not surprising given that his district has historically been one of the most Republican districts in the Northeast.  However, redistricting made the 16th somewhat less Republican.  The old 16th had a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+8, but since the 2010 round of redistricting, it has a PVI of R+4.  He received 100% ratings from the [[American Conservative Union]] in 2005 and the [[Christian Coalition of America]] in 2004.

In 2002, after a federal judge ordered the removal of the Ten Commandments from the Chester County courthouse, Pitts released a press statement that said, &quot;I think that religion and the Ten Commandments in particular should have a role in our public life&quot; and supported The Ten Commandments Defense Act (H.R. 2045). Since his first term Pitts has been chairman of the Values Action Team, a subgroup of the [[Republican Study Committee]] that coordinates legislation with the [[Christian right]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Election 08 Results by District&quot;. Congressional Quarterly. Retrieved 2009-06-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years Pitts has received 100% ratings from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 0% ratings from Public Citizens Congress Watch. In 2008 the ACLU gave him an 18% rating, the Human Rights Campaign gave him a score of 0%, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights gave him a score of 4%. In 2007–08 the [[John Birch Society]] gave him a score of 67%, and the [[American Conservative Union]] gave him a 100% rating, as did the Christian Coalition. Others: American Association of University Women, 2007–08, 16%; Republicans for Environmental Protection, 7% in 2007; and the Children's Health Fund, 2007–08, 0%; National Rifle Association, 2008, A; Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, 2003, 0%; National Breast Cancer Coalition, 2007–08, 0%; Children's Health Fund 2007–08, 0%. Ratings from labor groups are consistently at or near 0%; the Alliance for Worker Freedom, 2008, 100%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=265 Retrieved January 28, 2010 Ratings by issue for Rep.Pitts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitts visited [[Afghanistan]] after the fall of the [[Taliban]] and [[Pakistan]] in 2002. He visited Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq, and Israel in 2008 as part of a Congressional Delegation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00001633_2008.pdf Pitts' visits to the Middle East]&lt;/ref&gt; He is a leading congressional advocate of [[nuclear power]], and &quot;introduced a bill in 2009 to fast-track the regulatory process for approving new reactors, he called it the 'Streamline America's Future Energy (SAFE) Nuclear Act.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Justin (2011-03-13) [http://www.salon.com/news/japan_earthquake/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2011/03/14/nuclear_industry_messaging_safety Crisis casts doubt on nuke industry P.R. campaign], ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitts is an advocate of a federal prohibition of online [[poker]].  In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the [[Bob Goodlatte]]-[[Jim Leach]] Internet Gambling Prohibition Act&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4411]&lt;/ref&gt; and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04777: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4777]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stupak–Pitts Amendment]] is an amendment to [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009]] written by Pitts and Democrat [[Bart Stupak]] of Michigan, and it inserted abortion into the national health overhaul debate. This amendment continues his longtime opposition to abortion. According to [[Jeff Sharlet (writer)|Jeff Sharlet]], a contributing editor for Harper's, Pitts is a documented member of the Bible-oriented Christian group &quot;[[The Fellowship (Christian organization)]]&quot; and the C Street group in Washington, D.C.

In the [[112th Congress]], Pitts introduced the Protect Life Act, which would place additional restrictions on abortion access.

In July 2011, Pitts was revealed, in course of an [[FBI]] investigation, to have accepted tainted funds traced to the intelligence services of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Author John Morgan |url=http://thepennsylvaniaprogressive.com/diary/3485/joe-pitts-took-pakistani-money |title=Joe Pitts Took Pakistani Money – thepennsylvaniaprogressive |publisher=Thepennsylvaniaprogressive.com |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These funds were routed through the so-called Kashmiri American Council (KAC), run by [[Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai]], who was convicted of several felonies by the Federal government.

In October 2015, Pitts was named to serve on the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood|Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/23/boehners-next-select-committee-focusing-on-planned-parenthood-to-be-led-by-marsha-blackburn/|title=Boehner’s next select committee, focusing on Planned Parenthood, to be led by Marsha Blackburn|author=Paul Kane|date=October 23, 2015|work=Washington Post|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation====
On March 26, 2014, Pitts introduced the [[Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (H.R. 4302; 113th Congress)]] into the House. The bill would delay until March 2015 the pending cut to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], a cut that has been regularly delayed for over a decade.&lt;ref name=ViebeckHill&gt;{{cite news|last=Viebeck|first=Elise|title=Obama threatens to veto GOP 'doc fix' bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/medicare/200620-obama-threatens-to-veto-gop-healthcare-bill|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GOPreadies26&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House GOP readies year-long 'doc fix'|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/healthcare/201770-gop-tees-up-year-long-doc-fix-patch|accessdate=27 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would not offset this spending with increased revenue or cuts to spending in other places, a source of controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOPreadies26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HouseApproves27&quot;/&gt; Pitts said he still supports a permanent fix to the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula and is &quot;sponsoring this bill today because it is my earnest hope that this is the last patch we will have to pass.&quot;&lt;ref name=HouseApproves27&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House approves 'doc fix' in voice vote|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/201932-house-approves-doc-fix-in-voice-vote|accessdate=27 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 2014, Pitts introduced into the House the [[Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 (H.R. 4771; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would expand the list of anabolic steroids regulated by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) to include about two dozen new substances and would establish new crimes relating to false [[Labelling|labeling]] of [[steroid]]s.&lt;ref name=cbo4771&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4771|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45595|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of steroid enhances muscles.&lt;ref name=HillCrackDown&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passes bill to crack down on anabolic steroids|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/217756-house-passes-bill-to-crack-down-on-anabolic-steroids|accessdate=16 September 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would establish a penalty of up to $500,000 against those found to be falsely labeling their anabolic steroid products.&lt;ref name=&quot;HillCrackDown&quot;/&gt;
