The '''''Osvetnik''-class''' consisted of two submarines built by [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]], [[Nantes]], France, for the navy of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia). Launched in 1928–29, the vessels were named ''[[Yugoslav submarine Osvetnik|Osvetnik]]'' (Avenger) and ''[[Yugoslav submarine Smeli|Smeli]]'' (Daring) in [[Serbo-Croatian]]. They were built to a partial [[double hull]] Simonot design similar to the French {{sclass-|Circé|submarine|4}}. The ''Osvetnik''-class was the second class of submarines to serve in the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]], and joined the two larger British-made [[Hrabri-class submarine|''Hrabri''-class submarines]] to make up the pre-war Yugoslav submarine force. They were armed with six {{convert|550|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]], one {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and one {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]], and could dive to {{convert|80|m|ft}}.

Prior to [[World War II]] both submarines participated in cruises to [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] ports. Both submarines were captured by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian forces]] at the [[Bay of Kotor]] during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After refit, they saw service as experimental and training vessels with the [[Regia Marina]] as ''Francesco Rismondo'' and ''Antonio Bajamonti'' respectively. They were both [[scuttling|scuttled]] in September 1943 following the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender]], ''Francesco Rismondo'' by the Germans following her capture, and ''Antonio Bajamonti'' by the Italians themselves.

==Description and construction==
Yugoslav naval policy in the [[interwar period]] lacked direction until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=732}} although it was generally accepted that the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of [[submarine]]s, coastal [[torpedo boat]]s, [[torpedo bomber]]s and conventional [[bomber]] aircraft to perform this role. The ''Osvetnik''-class submarines were one of the acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=779}}

The ''Osvetnik''-class was built for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) by the [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] company (ACL) at [[Nantes]], [[France]]. Their design was based on a partial [[double hull]] design developed by ACL's chief engineer, G. Simonot,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} which was similar to the French {{sclass-|Circé|submarine|4}}.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}} Their [[Serbo-Croatian]] names of {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Osvetnik||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Smeli||2}} translate as &quot;Avenger&quot; and &quot;Daring&quot; respectively. They had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|66.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a surfaced [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|3.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Their surfaced [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|630|LT}}, or {{convert|809|LT}} submerged, and their crews consisted of 43 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} They had an operational depth of {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}}

They had two shafts driven by two [[MAN SE|MAN]] (Maschinenfabrik) [[diesel engine]]s (when surfaced) or two Nancy electric motors (when submerged). The diesel engines were rated at {{convert|1480|bhp|lk=in|abbr=on}} and the electric motors at {{convert|1000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}}, and they were designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|14.5|kn|km/h}} under diesel power while surfaced, and {{convert|9.2|kn|km/h}} on their electric motors when submerged. They were armed with six {{convert|550|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]] (four bow-mounted, two stern-mounted), one {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and one {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} They had a surfaced radius action of {{convert|3500|nmi|km}} at {{convert|9|kn|km/h}}, and {{convert|75|nmi|km}} at {{convert|5|kn|km/h}} submerged.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}}

==Service history==
''Smeli'' was launched on 1 December 1928, and ''Osvetnik'' on 14 January 1929.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} They arrived in the [[Bay of Kotor]] on the southern Adriatic coast on 9 December 1929.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===''Osvetnik''===
{{main|Yugoslav submarine Osvetnik}}
First of the class, ''Osvetnik'' was involved in a series of visits to Mediterranean ports during the interwar period.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=453, 641, 738}} She was captured in port by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|pp=267, 457}}{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=251}} She was refitted and modernised before being commissioned by the Italians as ''Francesco Rismondo'', but was only used for training and experimentation.{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|pp=170–171}} After the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender]], she was captured then scuttled by the Germans in September 1943.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}

===''Smeli''===
{{main|Yugoslav submarine Smeli}}
''Smeli'' was the second and last of her class.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} She also participated in several cruises in the Mediterranean during the interwar period.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=544, 838}} After capture by the Italians, ''Smeli'' was refitted and modernised before being commissioned as ''Antonio Bajamonti'', but was only used for training and experimentation.{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|pp=170–171}} She was scuttled by the Italians in September 1943 after the Italian surrender.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}
