'''Northampton War Memorial''', officially the '''Town and County War Memorial''', is a [[First World War memorial]] on Wood Hill in the centre of [[Northampton]], the [[county town]] of [[Northamptonshire]], in central England. Designed by architect [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]], it consists of a [[Stone of Remembrance]] flanked by twin [[obelisk]]s draped with painted stone flags, all standing in a small garden in what was formerly part of the churchyard of [[All Saints' Church, Northampton|All Saints' Church]]. 

Discussion of a war memorial for Northampton began shortly after the armistice in 1918, and from July 1919 a temporary wooden cenotaph stood on Abington Street in the town centre. The Northamptonshire War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a permanent memorial. The monument's design was completed and approved quickly, but its installation was delayed by six years until the site could be purchased from the Church of England, which required a [[faculty (instrument)|faculty]] from the local diocese. The memorial was finally unveiled on 11 November 1926 after a service and a parade including local schoolchildren and civic leaders.  

Northampton's memorial is one of the more elaborate town memorials in England. It uses three features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials: a pair of obelisks, the Stone of Remembrance (which Lutyens designed for the [[Imperial War Graves Commission]]), and painted stone flags on the obelisks, which were rejected for his [[the Cenotaph, Whitehall|Cenotaph]] in London but feature on several of his other memorials. Today it is a Grade I [[listed building]]; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a &quot;national collection&quot; and all were granted listed building status or had their listing renewed.

==Background==
The [[First World War]] produced casualties on an unprecedented scale; men from every town and village in Northamptonshire died in the war, with the exception of two [[thankful villages]] ([[East Carlton]] in the north of the county and [[Woodend, Northamptonshire|Woodend]] in the south). In the war's aftermath, thousands of memorials were built across Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Sawford, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the most prominent designers of war memorials was architect [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]], described by [[Historic England]] as &quot;the leading English architect of his generation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot; /&gt; Prior to the First World War, Lutyens established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy patrons; in the war's aftermath, he devoted much of his time to memorialising the casualties. He served as one of the three principal architects to the [[Imperial War Graves Commission]] (IWGC; later the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, CWCG) and designed numerous war memorials for towns and villages across Britain, as well as several elsewhere in the Commonwealth. He was responsible for [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] on [[Whitehall]] in London, which became the focal point of the national [[Remembrance Sunday]] commemorations; the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing]], the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world; and the [[Stone of Remembrance]] (also known as the Great War Stone), which appears in all large [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] cemeteries and forms part of several of his civic memorials, including Northampton's.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot;&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1191327 |desc=The Town and County War Memorial |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boorman (1988), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridley&quot;&gt;Ridley, pp. 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corke&quot;&gt;Corke p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissioning==
[[File:Town and County War Memorial, Northampton (15).jpg|upright|thumb|left|The memorial from the west side, with three of the four painted flags visible]]
Northampton's first war memorial was a temporary [[cenotaph]] built from wood and plaster which stood in Abington Street from July 1919 as a placeholder until a more permanent memorial could be erected; the temporary cenotaph was the focal point for remembrance services until the installation of the permanent memorial. As in several towns and cities, there were discussions within the town as to whether its war memorial should serve a purely monumental purpose or some sort of community function. Suggestions included renovating civic buildings, a new 2,000-seat concert hall, and a classical-style arch on Guildhall road. The Northamptonshire War Memorial Committee, chaired by local landowner [[John Powys, 5th Baron Lilford]], eventually commissioned Lutyens to design a purely commemorative monument, and selected a site in part of the churchyard of [[All Saints' Church, Northampton|All Saints' Church]]. The memorial was funded by public donations, including a donation of £50 from Lord Lilford.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boorman 122&quot;&gt;Boorman (1988), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sawford, pp. 131–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutyens' designs were complete by 1920 and approved in November of that year, but as the chosen site was part of the churchyard, and several graves would have to be relocated to accommodate the memorial, the war memorial committee had to seek a [[Faculty (instrument)|faculty]] from the [[Anglican Diocese of Peterborough|Diocese of Peterborough]] (the diocese in whose jurisdiction Northampton falls), which delayed the installation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutyenstrustexhibitions1.org.uk/november-2015/4591266509|title=War Memorial of the Month – November 2015 – Northampton|last=Skelton|first=Tim|date=November 2015|work=Memorials of the Great War Exhibition|publisher=The Lutyens Trust|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reverend Geoffrey Warden, vicar of All Saints' Church, submitted the application in 1922, supported by two church wardens and two parishioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;p73&quot; /&gt; Construction work commenced only in 1926, six years after the completion of the designs. By July 1926, the ''Northampton Independent'' reported that the obelisks had been carved and were waiting for the flags to be painted before they could be erected.&lt;ref&gt;Skelton, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Northampton's is a comparatively elaborate war memorial, especially for a town rather than a city. It consists of a [[Stone of Remembrance]] flanked by tall twin [[obelisk]]s, each adorned with a pair of painted stone flags. Its use of obelisks, a [[Stone of Remembrance]], and painted flags—all features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials—make it particularly significant among his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skelton, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each obelisk sits on a tall, four-tiered rectangular column which itself stands on a wider, undercut square plinth. The obelisks and their supporting columns are ornately decorated. A narrow cross is set into the obelisks while the town's coat of arms is moulded onto the columns; the columns contain deep decorative [[Niche (architecture)|niches]], forming an arch shape beneath the obelisks. Obelisks feature in several of Lutyens' war memorials, though only Northampton's and [[Manchester Cenotaph|Manchester's]] use a pair of flanking obelisks (in Manchester's case, the obelisks flank a cenotaph, rather than a stone); both are particularly fine designs in which Lutyens uses the obelisks with &quot;dignity and simple dramatic effect&quot;, according to historian Richard Barnes.&lt;ref&gt;Borg, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; The obelisks are inscribed with the dates of the First and Second World Wars in Roman numerals (the inscriptions relating to the [[Second World War]] were added at a later date).&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p73&quot;&gt;Skelton, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skelton, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{multiple image|footer=Close-ups of the obelisks showing the decorative carving and the draped stone flags|image1=Town and County War Memorial, Northampton (06).jpg|image2=Town and County War Memorial, Northampton (02).jpg}}
Two stone flags—painted in the form of the [[Union Flag]] and the flags of the Royal Navy (the [[White Ensign]]), Merchant Navy (the [[Red Ensign]]), and Royal Air Force (the [[Royal Air Force Ensign|RAF Ensign]])—appear to hang from each obelisk, draping around the [[cornice]]s; each flag is surmounted by gold wreaths. Lutyens first proposed stone flags for use on the Cenotaph on Whitehall, but the proposal was rejected in favour of fabric flags (though they were used on several other memorials, including [[Rochdale Cenotaph]] and the [[Arch of Remembrance]] in [[Leicester]]&lt;ref&gt;Skelton, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skelton, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone is a [[monolith]] (carved from a single piece of rock), curved so slightly as to barely be visible to the naked eye, {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=off}} tall and devoid of any decoration beyond the inscriptions. Unusually, the Stone of Remembrance is inscribed on both faces. The east face bears the inscription Lutyens chose for all his Stones of Remembrance: &quot;THEIR NAME LIVETH / FOR EVERMORE&quot;, as suggested by [[Rudyard Kipling]], truncated from a verse in the [[Book of Ecclesiastes]]; the west face is inscribed &quot;THE SOULS OF THE RIGHTEOUS / ARE IN THE HANDS OF GOD&quot;, from [[The Wisdom of Solomon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corke&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skelton, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole memorial is raised on a stone platform that forms a narrow path between the stone and the obelisks. The Stone of Remembrance is further raised on three stone steps. The memorial stands in a small garden now just outside the All Saints churchyard, defined by a low stone wall to the front and a yew hedge to the rear with ornamental gateways to either side. The gates are of cast iron and supported by large stone piers with urn [[finial]]s. The wall is inscribed: &quot;TO THE MEMORY OF ALL THOSE OF THIS TOWN AND COUNTY WHO SERVED AND DIED IN THE GREAT WAR&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boorman 05&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Town and County War Memorial, Northampton (12).jpg|thumb|The [[Stone of Remembrance]] in the centre of the memorial; Lutyens designed the stone for the Imperial War Graves Commission's cemeteries but it also features in several of his war memorials.]]  
The memorial was eventually unveiled on 11 November ([[Armistice Day]]) 1926, as part of a large [[wikt:ecumenical|ecumenical]] service, which included 5,000 local schoolchildren. The crowd was large enough that the service could not be accommodated in the church and was instead held in the market square. At the conclusion of the service, the crowd proceeded to the new memorial; the parade was led by veterans from the Battle of Mons and included other military representatives, nurses from [[Northampton General Hospital]], and the town's civic leaders. Once in the square, the unveiling was performed by General [[Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne]] and the memorial was dedicated by the Reverend [[Norman Lang (bishop)|Norman Lang]], [[Suffragan Bishop of Leicester]]. Horne committed the memorial to the care of the town's mayor and [[Northamptonshire County Council]], and in his speech referred to Northampton's role as the [[county town]]; he observed that communities across Northamptonshire would be erecting their own memorials, but felt that it was &quot;right and fitting that there should stand in the county town some visible monument, some tangible memorial appealing to the heart through the eye, of the bravery, devotion to duty, and self-sacrifice of the men of Northamptonshire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot;/&gt; The [[Prince of Wales]] laid a wreath during a ceremony on 7 July 1927, the year after the unveiling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boorman 122&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boorman 05&quot;&gt;Boorman (2005), pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Town and County War Memorial does not contain a list of casualties. The local branch of [[the Royal British Legion]] launched a campaign for a memorial dedicated to the town and containing a list of names. A garden of remembrance was built in Abington Square, the location of the original temporary cenotaph, and unveiled by Major General Sir John Brown in 1937; the names of the fallen were inscribed on the garden walls. The memorial to [[Edgar Mobbs]]—a professional rugby player from Northampton who was killed in the First World War in 1917—was moved into the garden.&lt;ref&gt;Boorman (1988), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boorman 05&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sawford, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial was designated a Grade II* [[listed building]] on 22 January 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE&quot;/&gt; In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a &quot;national collection&quot;. All of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their [[National Heritage List for England]] list entries updated and expanded. As part of this process, Northampton War Memorial was upgraded to Grade I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/news-and-features/news/lutyens-war-memorials|title=National Collection of Lutyens' War Memorials Listed|date=7 November 2015|publisher=[[Historic England]]|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
