== Semi-protected edit request on 17 April 2014 ==

{{edit semi-protected|&lt;!-- Page to be edited --&gt;|answered=yes}}
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;
The final line of the second paragraph in Legacy contains two errors. As of April 17, it read, &quot;The Neil Armstrong Air and Space Museum is located in his hometown of Wapakoneta, Ohio, although it has no official ties to Armstrong, and the airport in New Knoxville where he took his first flying lessons is named for him.[161]&quot;
First, the museum is the Armstrong Air &amp; Space Museum (see www.armstrongmuseum.org). The airport in New Knoxville is named for Neil Armstrong, but he did not take flying lessons there. It opened in 1956, after Neil Armstrong has already flown 78 missions in Korea (see http://www.neilarmstrongairport.com/about-us). Mr. Armstrong learned to fly at Port Koneta, a now-defunct airfield near Wapakoneta (see ''First Man'', by James Hansen, available here: http://books.google.com/books?id=rMS6JFuLgx4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=port+koneta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f1FZLGyBkB&amp;sig=Wtu80p4_xLxvlp4cSWeinXvDbig&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hFdPU43BNMfA0QHR4IHgBg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=port%20koneta&amp;f=false)
The referenced article [161] from Cincinnati.com is also in error, though the Museum's name might have included &quot;Neil&quot; when the magazine published the article in 2007.

:I've corrected the museum name, and updated the airport information. It appears he did take flying lessons there when he was 15, and it was mainly a field.

== Edits to External Links ==
The first link in the section is broken. It [is supposed to] links to a Wayback Machine version of website created by the Armstrong family. This link should be removed. I'd also like to add a link to the online exhibition from the University of Cincinnati Libraries that contains nearly as much information as the original family page. THis page is located at http://uc.edu/armstrong. As the page is semi-protected and I have only eight edits, I cannot edit directly. Could someone please make these changes?

:The UC site's a good add; thanks for that.

:I think it's worth keeping a link to the subject's own website in the form it last appeared, however.  Looks like it was added incorrectly (and I suspect that if I were to delve through the history that I may have been the culprit there), hence the inoperative link.  I've re-added it, ensuring that it links correctly.  I've placed it third: I think both the UC exhibit and NASA page should have higher prominence.

== Dryden Flight Research Center now Armstrong Flight Research Center ==

The first paragraph mentions Dryden Flight Research Center.  Dryden was renamed Armstrong Flight Research Center in honor of Neil Armstrong as of March 1, 2014. This should also be reflected in the Legacy section.  Reference: [[ http://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/home/#.U4s]]

== Criticism of Armstrong's &quot;one small step&quot; quote: WP:NOT ==

The latter half of this sentence, presenting a grammatical criticism of Armstrong's famous quote, is problematic:

:The broadcast did not have the &quot;a&quot; before &quot;man&quot;, ''rendering the phrase contradictory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Thomson Handbook |first=David |last=Blakesley |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NWcFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA725#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=725}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Study Listening: A Course in Listening to Lectures and Note Taking |first=Tony |last=Lynch |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HeIN0dbjnE8C&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(as ''man'' in such use is synonymous with ''mankind'')''.  

The problem is, [[WP:NOTGUIDE|Wikipedia is not a manual, guidebook, textbook, or scientific journal]]. This was originally added as, I believe, someone's [[WP:OR|original research]] (without citations), and sources recently added aren't really notable. It is an encyclopedia's job to accurately present information (''what'' Armstrong said), but not to criticize ''how'' he said it. It doesn't matter if you can provide sources to verify the criticism, if such criticism is not a [[WP:Notability|notable topic]] in and of itself. The commentary in italics above, I believe should be stricken.

Also, it's a matter of interpretation whether or not it's contradictory or redundant; although &quot;small step&quot; and &quot;giant leap&quot; might seem contradictory (ever heard of a ''paradox'', which is obviously what Armstrong intended?), &quot;for man&quot; and &quot;for mankind&quot; both refer to the same thing and thus are redundant. So the criticism is really a matter of opinion and thus outside of the encyclopedia's purview.

It's almost self-evidently true that it doesn't make much sense as literally quoted; most public observers noticed the omission almost as soon as he said it (at least by the time they had a chance to think about it.) Yet I don't remember ever reading or hearing in a notable publication that anybody made a big deal of it. Notice the sources cited, two college textbooks dated 2004 and 2008. Does anyone expect to find any sources closer to 1969 to establish notability? My theory is that it's a cultural change that we're quicker to criticise the establishment nowadays. I think [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]] demands we don't buy into this. [[User:JustinTime55|JustinTime55]] ([[User talk:JustinTime55|talk]]) 16:46, 10 July 2014 (UTC)

:::A paper came out recently in PLOS One that indicates that he did say 'a' man. http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155975
This article in Science mag, summarizes it; 'By analyzing the duration Armstrong spoke each word, the researchers found it would have been easy for listeners to exclude the “a,” especially in a fuzzy recording, they report in PLOS ONE. And because of the astronaut’s intention to be humble, and the context of the speech, they agree that “one small step for a man” is the more probable phrase.' http://www.sciencemag.org/news/sifter/linguists-question-armstrong-s-famous-moon-landing-quote

I can't edit it. Thanks.

:The article says: {{tq|...Armstrong found Ford's analysis &quot;persuasive.&quot; However, the article by Ford was published on Ford's own web site rather than in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, and linguists David Beaver and Mark Liberman wrote of their skepticism of Ford's claims on the blog Language Log. Thus, NASA's transcript continues to show the &quot;a&quot; in parentheses.}}&lt;br /&gt; If this is what you're referring to then we should tell NASA.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Trebuchet MS&quot;&gt;[[User:Mlpearc|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Mlpearc'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mlpearc|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FFD700&quot;&gt;'''open channel'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 01:12, 21 July 2014 (UTC)

== Armstrong's Involvement with the Ecuadorian &quot;Metal Library&quot; ==

Rather than just wade into a most notable person's biography with clumsy edits, I wanted to get an opinion on the following.

I came across this tidbit of factual information regarding an expedition that Armstrong was involved with to find the Metal Library in Ecuador. The expedition took place in 1976 in the Cueva de los Tayos. I've read a number of articles indicating his involvement as expedition &quot;figurehead&quot;. The following URL actually contains a photograph of Armstrong inside the cave system: http://www.philipcoppens.com/metal_libr.html.

This is the same Metal Library that [[Erich von Däniken]] became obsessed with in the late 1960s.

There is an [[Cueva_de_los_Tayos|existing article]] on Wikipedia already. Perhaps a small note could be added here.
[[User:Sugarfish|sugarfish]] ([[User talk:Sugarfish|talk]]) 06:02, 4 January 2015 (UTC)

:I think that it might be wise to find an alternative source - [[Philip Coppens (author)|Philip Coppens]] seems to have specialised in fringe material, and accordingly might be a bit suspect for details.

== Another quote controversy: &quot;vast leap&quot; ==

[[User:Sunflowertree]] has been edit warring, adding an uncited reference to a supposed controversy that Armstrong said &quot;one vast leap for mankind&quot; instead of &quot;one giant leap&quot;. I just did a Google scan and found out this apparently is becoming an internet meme; some idiot created a YouTube video claiming this, which has apparently sparked some discussion on various forums. (Funny how no one else has heard &quot;vast leap&quot; before, in the 46 intervening years. It would be ''really'' funny if the video creator ''were'' Sunflowertree.)

We don't want to open this can of worms; YouTube is ''not'' generally considered a [[WP:RS]], especially for this type of thing. (Any asshat can post a YouTube video.) YouTube and the internet in general has just become a more efficient way of spreading [[urban legend]]s. I don't think this qualifies as a bona fide [[WP:FRINGE|fringe theory]], and it is not our business to help promote just another urban legend.

== Armstrong's Military Affiliation ==

The info box/overview on the right-hand side of the beginning of the article is incorrect.  It lists his military affiliation as USAF when it was clearly USN.

Why do you think that? And please sign your posts (4 x ~). [[User:Britmax|Britmax]] ([[User talk:Britmax|talk]]) 16:18, 23 July 2015 (UTC)

== Was &quot;one small step&quot; pre-prepared? ==

The article presently says:  &lt;blockquote&gt;Armstrong did not prepare his famous [[epigram]] in advance. In a 1983 interview with [[George Plimpton]] in [[Esquire Magazine]], it was revealed that Armstrong &quot;had produced the lines on his own&amp;nbsp;... and the words were composed not on the long trip up there, as had been supposed by most of his colleagues, nor beforehand but ''after'' the actual landing of ''Eagle'' on the moon's surface.&quot; He explained to Plimpton that &quot;I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money—fifty-fifty&amp;nbsp;... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Plimpton |first=George |title=Neil Armstrong's Famous First Words |work=Esquire |date=December 1983 |pages=113–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  {{reflist-talk}}

This is contradicted by reports that he had written the line before he left Earth:

He said 'why don’t you and I, once the boys go to bed, why don’t we play a game of Risk’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said I’d enjoy that. We started playing Risk and then he slipped me a piece of paper and said 'read that’.

He said 'I thought you might like that, but I wanted you to read it’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then added: “It was 'that is one small step for A man’.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Richard|title=Neil Armstrong’s family reveal origins of 'one small step' line|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/9770712/Neil-Armstrongs-family-reveal-origins-of-one-small-step-line.html|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quotation|&lt;p&gt;In numerous interviews, and even in his own autobiography, Armstrong said he thought of the words after arriving at the moon, while waiting to exit his lunar module Eagle. But in a new BBC documentary, the astronaut's brother Dean Armstrong says the two discussed the statement months earlier, when Neil passed Dean a handwritten note during a late-night game of Risk, according to British newspaper the Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On that piece of paper there was 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' He says 'what do you think about that?' I said 'fabulous.' He said 'I thought you might like that, but I wanted you to read it,'&quot; Dean Armstrong said, according to the Telegraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Clara|title=Neil Armstrong's 'One Small Step': Controversy Erupts Over Moonwalk Quote|url=http://www.space.com/19096-neil-armstrong-first-words-moon.html|website=Space.com|accessdate=24 July 2015|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}}
{{quotation|&lt;p&gt;The very first public statement Neil made about the subject was at the post-flight press conference on Aug. 12, 1969, following his return from [http://www.space.com/15864-nasa-apollo-11-moon-landing-photos.html Apollo 11]. Asked by a reporter when he came up with the quote, Armstrong answered as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I did think about it. It was not extemporaneous, neither was it planned. It evolved during the conduct of the flight and I decided what the words would be while we were on the lunar surface just prior to leaving the LM.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Aug. 22, 1969, issue of LIFE magazine, Armstrong elaborated a bit more. &quot;I had thought about that a little before the flight,&quot; he wrote, &quot;mainly because so many people had made such a big point of it. I had also thought about it a little on the way to the moon, but not much. It wasn't until after landing that I made up my mind what to say.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story [http://www.space.com/17768-neil-armstrong-andrew-chaikin-memory.html Neil told me when I interviewed him] in 1988 for my book &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot; (even though I did not specifically ask the question, knowing he was probably tired of answering it). It was also the story Armstrong told his biographer James Hansen in 2003. It is simply not true, as several recent news articles have claimed, that Armstrong always said he composed the quote &quot;spontaneously.&quot; It would have been completely out of character for Armstrong, who was thoughtful about nearly everything he said and did, to have offered such an important quote without thinking it through beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing in Neil’s post-flight statements rules out the possibility that he thought up the &quot;one small step&quot; line before leaving Earth. He didn’t say &quot;I thought up the quote after we landed;&quot; he said, &quot;I decided what I would say after we landed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dean Armstrong's story just adds a little ambiguity. Maybe Neil had more than one quote in mind at that point, and only shared one of them with his brother. Or maybe the quote he showed his brother was an early draft, but after all these years, Dean remembers seeing the final version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chaikin|first1=Andrew|title=Neil Armstrong Didn't Lie About 'One Small Step' Moon Speech, Historian Says|url=http://www.space.com/19136-neil-armstrong-moon-speech-truth.html|website=Space.com|accessdate=24 July 2015|date=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}}
{{reflist-talk}}

In light of this, I don't think the current text can stand without some mention of Dean's account that Neil had scripted the line (or at least a version of it) back on Earth (although he may not have decided that was the line he would use at that moment until later).  &lt;small&gt;—'''[[User:sroc|sroc]]'''&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:sroc|&amp;#x1F4AC;]]&lt;/small&gt; 11:34, 24 July 2015 (UTC)

Neil later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California.&quot;

I recommend that the last paragraph in the subsection &quot;Navy service&quot; be relocated two sections below to the subsection &quot;Test pilot&quot; because this paragraph is blatantly and glaringly misplaced.  It currently reads:

&quot;As a research pilot, Armstrong served as project pilot on the F-100 Super Sabre A and C variants, F-101 Voodoo, and the Lockheed F-104A Starfighter. He also flew the Bell X-1B, Bell X-5, North American X-15, F-105 Thunderchief, F-106 Delta Dart, B-47 Stratojet, KC-135 Stratotanker, and was one of eight elite pilots involved in the paraglider research vehicle program (Paresev).&quot;

None of the test flying described in the above paragraph was part of Neil Armstrong's active naval service.  Some or much of it overlapped with his eight years in the Naval Reserve, but that's entirely incidental and in no way related to the U.S. Navy or Armstrong's service in it.

Note that this misplaced paragraph won't fit as is (i.e., without modification) in the &quot;Text pilot&quot; section.  Someone with intimate knowledge of Neil Armstrong's career will need to rewrite so as to integrate the content.  Moreover, the misplaced paragraph fails to name the B-29, which the &quot;Test pilot&quot; subsection recounts him flying.

This is just for your consideration.  I'm not the person who can or should correct it but it definitely needs to be addressed.

Many thanks for all you do.
