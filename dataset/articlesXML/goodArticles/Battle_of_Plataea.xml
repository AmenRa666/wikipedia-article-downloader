{{Campaignbox Second Persian invasion of Greece}}

The '''Battle of Plataea''' was the final land battle during the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]]. It took place in 479 BC near the city of [[Plataea]] in [[Boeotia]], and was fought between an alliance of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]]s, including [[Sparta]], [[History of Athens|Athens]], [[Corinth]] and [[Megara]], and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[Xerxes I]].

The previous year the Persian invasion force, led by the Persian king in person, had scored victories at the battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]] and conquered [[Thessaly]], Boeotia, Euboea and [[Attica]]. However, at the ensuing [[Battle of Salamis]], the Allied Greek navy had won an unlikely but decisive victory, preventing the conquest of the [[Peloponnesus]]. Xerxes then retreated with much of his army, leaving his general [[Mardonius]] to finish off the Greeks the following year.

In the summer of 479&amp;nbsp;BC the Greeks assembled a huge (by ancient standards) army and marched out of the Peloponnesus. The Persians retreated to Boeotia and built a fortified camp near Plataea. The Greeks, however, refused to be drawn into the prime cavalry terrain around the Persian camp, resulting in a stalemate that lasted 11 days. While attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted, the Greek battle line fragmented. Thinking the Greeks in full retreat, Mardonius ordered his forces to pursue them, but the Greeks (particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians) halted and gave battle, routing the lightly armed Persian [[infantry]] and killing Mardonius.

A large portion of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The destruction of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the [[Battle of Mycale]], decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. Although Plataea was in every sense a resounding victory, it does not seem to have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example, the Athenian victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] or the Spartan [[Battle of Thermopylae|defeat at Thermopylae]].

== Background ==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|First Persian invasion of Greece|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}
The Greek city-states of Athens and [[Eretria]] had supported the unsuccessful [[Ionian Revolt]] against the Persian Empire of [[Darius I]] in 499–494&amp;nbsp;BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young and prone to revolts by its subject peoples.&lt;ref name=h47&gt;Holland, pp. 47–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Darius was an usurper and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.&lt;ref name=h47/&gt; The Ionian Revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and he thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+5.105&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 V.105]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h171/&gt; Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name=h171&gt;Holland, 171–178&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary expedition under Mardonius, in 492&amp;nbsp;BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of [[Thrace]] and forced [[Macedon]] to become a fully subordinate client kingdom of Persia,&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+6.43.1&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 VI, 43.1-44.1]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=342-345}} the latter which had been a Persian vassal as early as the late 6th century BC.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=343}} An amphibious task force was then sent out under [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]] in 490&amp;nbsp;BC, using [[Delos]] as an intermediate base at, successfully sacking [[Karystos]] and [[Eretria]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D99%3Asection%3D1 VI.99.1-101.3]&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to attack Athens. However, at the ensuing [[Battle of Marathon]], the Athenians won a remarkable victory, resulting in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+6.113&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 VI.113]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|left|300px|A map showing the Greek world at the time of the battle]]

Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece. However, he died before the invasion could begin.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 206–208&lt;/ref&gt; The throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I, who quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece, including building two [[pontoon bridge]]s across the [[Hellespont]].&lt;ref name=h208&gt;Holland, pp. 208–211&lt;/ref&gt; In 481&amp;nbsp;BC Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for [[earth and water]] as a gesture of their submission, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta (both of whom were at open war with Persia).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.32.1&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 VII.32.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at [[Corinth]] in late autumn of 481&amp;nbsp;BC, and a confederate alliance of [[History of Greece|Greek city-states]] was formed (hereafter referred to as &quot;the Allies&quot;).&lt;ref name=VII145&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.145.1&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 VII.145.1]&lt;/ref&gt; This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.&lt;ref name=h226&gt;Holland, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies initially adopted a strategy of blocking land and sea approaches to southern Greece.&lt;ref name=h255&gt;Holland, pp. 255–257&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in August 480&amp;nbsp;BC, after hearing of Xerxes' approach, a small Allied army led by  Spartan King [[Leonidas I]] blocked the Pass of [[Thermopylae]], while an Athenian-dominated navy sailed to the Straits of [[Artemisium]]. Famously, the massively outnumbered Greek army held Thermopylae against the Persian army for three days before being outflanked by the Persians, who used a little-known mountain path.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D205 VII.205-233]&lt;/ref&gt; Although much of the Greek army retreated, the rearguard, formed of the Spartan and Thespian contingents, was surrounded and annihilated.&lt;ref name=h292&gt;Holland, pp. 292–294&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium, consisting of a series of naval encounters, was up to that point a stalemate;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.19.1&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 VIII.19.1]&lt;/ref&gt; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, they also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D21%3Asection%3D1 VIII.21.1-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Thermopylae the Persian army proceeded to burn and sack the Boeotian cities that had not surrendered, [[Plataea]] and [[Thespiae]], before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The Allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the [[Isthmus of Corinth]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D71%3Asection%3D1 VIII.71.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat of the Allies to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely, the allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee the security of the Peloponnese.&lt;ref name=h303&gt;Holland, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing naval [[Battle of Salamis]] ended in a decisive victory for the Allies, marking a turning point in the conflict.&lt;ref name=h333&gt;Holland, pp. 333–335&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Battle of Thermopylae and movements to Salamis, 480 BC.gif|right|thumb|300px|Movements of the Persian and Greek armies in 480–479&amp;nbsp;BC]]

Following the defeat of his navy at Salamis, Xerxes retreated to Asia with the bulk of his army. According to Herodotus, this was because he feared the Greeks would sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges, thereby trapping his army in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D97%3Asection%3D1 VIII.97.1]&lt;/ref&gt; He thus left Mardonius, with handpicked troops, to complete the conquest of Greece the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 327–329&lt;/ref&gt; Mardonius evacuated Attica and wintered in Thessaly;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; the Athenians then reoccupied their destroyed city.&lt;ref name=h333/&gt; Over the winter there seems to have been some tension among the Allies. The Athenians in particular, who were not protected by the Isthmus but whose fleet was the key to the security of the Peloponnese, felt hard done by and demanded that an allied army march north the following year.&lt;ref name=h333/&gt; When the Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king [[Leotychides]], thus skulked off [[Delos]], while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off [[Samos]], both sides unwilling to risk battle.&lt;ref name=h336/&gt; Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponnese.&lt;ref name=h333/&gt;

Mardonius moved to break the stalemate by trying to win over the Athenians and their fleet through the mediation of [[Alexander I of Macedon]], offering peace, self-government and territorial expansion.&lt;ref name=h336&gt;Holland, pp. 336–338&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was also on hand to hear the offer, and rejected it: &lt;blockquote&gt; ''The degree to which we are put in the shadow by the Medes' strength is hardly something you need to bring to our attention. We are already well aware of it. But even so, such is our love of liberty, that we will never surrender.''&lt;ref name=h336/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Upon this refusal, the Persians marched south again. Athens was again evacuated and left to the enemy. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, along with [[Megara]] and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance and threatening to accept the Persian terms if it was not given.&lt;ref name=Hyacinth&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.7&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.7-9]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Herodotus, the Spartans, who were at that time celebrating the festival of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]]us, delayed making a decision until they were persuaded by a guest, Chileos of [[Tegea]], who pointed out the danger to all of Greece if the Athenians surrendered.&lt;ref nae=Hyacinth When the Athenian emissaries delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans the next day, they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already ''en route''; the Spartan army was marching to meet the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D11 IX.11]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prelude ==
When Mardonius learned of the Spartan force, he completed the destruction of Athens, tearing down whatever was left standing.&lt;ref name=IX13&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.13&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.13]&lt;/ref&gt; He then retreated towards [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], hoping to lure the Greek army into territory that would be suitable for the Persian cavalry.&lt;ref name=IX13/&gt; Mardonius created a fortified encampment on the north bank of the [[Asopos (Boeotia)|Asopus]] river in Boeotia covering the ground from Erythrae past Hysiae and up to the lands of Plataea.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D15%3Asection%3D1 IX. 15.1-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athenians sent 8,000 [[hoplite]]s, led by [[Aristides]], along with 600 Plataean exiles to join the Allied army.&lt;ref name=IX28/&gt; The army then marched in Boeotia across the passes of [[Mount Cithaeron]], arriving near [[Plataea]], and above the Persian position on the Asopus.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; Under the guidance of the commanding general, [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]], the Greeks took up position opposite the Persian lines but remained on high ground.&lt;ref name=h343&gt;Holland, pp. 343–349&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing that he had little hope of successfully attacking the Greek positions, Mardonius sought to either sow dissension among the Allies or lure them down into the plain.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; Plutarch reports that a conspiracy was discovered among some prominent Athenians, who were planning to betray the Allied cause; although this account is not universally accepted, it may indicate Mardonius' attempts of intrigue within the Greek ranks.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt;

[[File:Battle of Plataea part 1.png|thumb|300px|left|The initial movements at the Battle of Plataea. The Greek line moves forward to the Asopus ridge.]]

Mardonius also initiated hit-and-run cavalry attacks against the Greek lines, possibly trying to lure the Greeks down to the plain in pursuit.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; Although having some initial success, this strategy backfired when the Persian cavalry commander [[Masistius]] was killed; with his death, the cavalry retreated.&lt;ref name=IX22&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.22.1&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.22.1-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their morale boosted by this small victory, the Greeks moved forward, still remaining on higher ground, to a new position nearer more suited for encampment and better watered.&lt;ref name=XI25&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D25%3Asection%3D1 IX.25.1-3]&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans and Tegeans were on a ridge to the right of the line, the Athenians on a hillock on the left and the other contingents on the slightly lower ground between.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; In response, Mardonius brought his men up to the Asopus and arrayed them for battle; However, neither the Persians nor the Greeks would attack; Herodotus claims this is because both sides received bad omens during sacrificial rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.33&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.33]&lt;/ref&gt; The armies thus stayed camped in their locations for eight days, during which new Greek troops arrived.&lt;ref name=IX39&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.39&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.39-41]&lt;/ref&gt; Mardonius then sought to break the stalemate by sending his cavalry to attack the passes of Mount Cithaeron; this raid resulted in the capture of a convoy of provisions intended for the Greeks.&lt;ref name=IX39/&gt; Two more days passed, during which time the supply lines of the Greeks continued to be menaced.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; Mardonius then launched another cavalry raid on the Greek lines, which succeeded in blocking the Gargaphian Spring, which had been the only source of water for the Greek army (they could not use the Asopus due to the threat posed by Persian archers).&lt;ref name=IX49&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.49&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.49]&lt;/ref&gt; Coupled with the lack of food, the restriction of the water supply made the Greek position untenable, so they decided to retreat to a position in front of Plataea, from where they could guard the passes and have access to fresh water.&lt;ref name=IX51&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.51&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.51-52]&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent the Persian cavalry from attacking during the retreat, it was to be performed that night.&lt;ref name=IX51/&gt;

However, the retreat went awry. The Allied contingents in the centre missed their appointed position and ended up scattered in front of Plataea itself.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding the rear of the retreat, had not even begun to retreat by daybreak.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the retreat and if possible join up with the Spartans.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt;&lt;ref name=IX54&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.54&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.54-55]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea,&lt;ref name=IX54/&gt; and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt;

== The opposing forces ==

=== The Greeks ===
According to Herodotus, the Spartans sent 45,000 men—5,000 [[Spartiate]]s (full citizen soldiers), 5,000 other [[Laconia (ancient region)|Lacodaemonian]] hoplites ([[perioeci]]) and 35,000 [[helots]] (seven per Spartiate).&lt;ref name=IX28/&gt;  This was probably the largest Spartan force ever assembled.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; The Greek army had been reinforced by contingents of hoplites from the other Allied city-states, as shown in the table. [[Diodorus Siculus]] claims in his [[Bibliotheca historica]] that the number of the Greek troops approached one hundred thousand.&lt;ref name=DiodorusXI.30.1/&gt;

According to Herodotus, there were a total of 69,500 lightly armed troops—35,000 helots&lt;ref name=IX29/&gt; and 34,500 troops from the rest of Greece; roughly one per hoplite.&lt;ref name=IX29/&gt; The number of 34,500 has been suggested to represent one light skirmisher supporting each non-Spartan hoplite (33,700), together with 800 Athenian archers, whose presence in the battle Herodotus later notes.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus tells us that there were also 1,800 Thespians (but does not say how they were equipped), giving a total strength of 108,200 men.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.30&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.30]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of hoplites is accepted as reasonable (and possible); the Athenians alone had fielded 10,000 hoplites at the Battle of Marathon.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; Some historians have accepted the number of light troops and used them as a [[population census]] of Greece at the time. Certainly these numbers are theoretically possible. Athens, for instance, allegedly fielded a fleet of 180 triremes at Salamis,&lt;ref name=VIII44&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D44%3Asection%3D1 VIII.44.1]&lt;/ref&gt; manned by approximately 36,000 rowers and fighters.&lt;ref&gt;180 triremes times 200 men; 170 rowers plus 30 fighters was the usual crew. See Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.184&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 VII.184], note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 69,500 light troops could easily have been sent to Plataea. Nevertheless, the number of light troops is often rejected as exaggerated, especially in view of the ratio of seven helots to one Spartiate.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; For instance, Lazenby accepts that hoplites from other Greek cities might have been accompanied by one lightly armoured retainer each, but rejects the number of seven helots per Spartiate.&lt;ref name=Laz227&gt;Lazenby, pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt; He further speculates that each Spartiate was accompanied by one armed helot, and that the remaining helots were employed in the logistical effort, transporting food for the army.&lt;ref name=Laz227/&gt; Both Lazenby and Holland deem the lightly armed troops, whatever their number, as essentially irrelevant to the outcome of battle.&lt;ref name=Laz227/&gt;&lt;ref name=h400&gt;Holland, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

A further complication is that a certain proportion of the Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D131 VIII.131]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of manpower which could not have contributed to Plataea, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek forces were, as agreed by the Allied congress, under the overall command of Spartan royalty in the person of [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]], who was the regent for Leonidas' young son, [[Pleistarchus]], his cousin. Diodorus tells us that the Athenian contingent was under the command of [[Aristides]];&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D29%3Asection%3D4 XI.29.4]&lt;/ref&gt; it is probable that the other contingents also had their leaders. Herodotus tells us in several places that the Greeks held council during the prelude to the battle, implying that decisions were consensual and that Pausanias did not have the authority to issue direct orders to the other contingents.&lt;ref name=XI25/&gt;&lt;ref name=IX51/&gt; This style of leadership contributed to the way events unfolded during the battle itself. For instance, in the period immediately before the battle, Pausanias was unable to order the Athenians to join up with his forces, and thus the Greeks fought the battle completely separated from each other.&lt;ref name=IX60/&gt;

=== The Persians ===
[[File:1784 Map of the Battle of Plataea, Greece - Geographicus - BattleofPlataea-bocage-1784.jpg|right|thumb|1780s map of the battle]]
According to [[Herodotus]], the [[Ancient Persia|Persians]] numbered 300,000 and were accompanied by troops from Greek city states that supported the Persian cause (including Thebes).&lt;ref name=IX32/&gt; Herodotus admits that no one counted the latter, but he guesses that there were about 50,000 of them.&lt;ref name=IX32&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.32&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.32]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ctesias]], who wrote a history of Persia based on Persian archives, claimed there were 120,000 Persian and 7,000 Greek soldiers, but his account is generally garbled (for instance, placing this battle before Salamis, he also says there were only 300 Spartans, 1000 perioeci and 6000 from the other cities at Plataea, perhaps confusing it with Thermopylae).&lt;ref name=ctes&gt;Ctesias, [http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesias/photius_persica2.html Persica]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diodorus Siculus]] claims in his [[Bibliotheca historica]] that the number of the Persian troops was some five hundred thousand.&lt;ref name=DiodorusXI.30.1&gt;Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D30%3Asection%3D1 XI.30.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure of 300,000 has been doubted, along with many of Herodotus' numbers, by many historians; modern consensus estimates the total [[Second Persian invasion of Greece#Size of the Persian forces|number of troops]] for the Persian invasion at around 250,000.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; According to this consensus, Herodotus' 300,000 Persians at Plataea would self-evidently be impossible. One approach to estimating the size of the Persian army has been to estimate how many men might feasibly have been accommodated within the Persian camp; this approach gives figures of between 70,000 and 120,000 men.&lt;ref name=h400/&gt; Lazenby, for instance, by comparison with later [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] military camps, calculates the number of troops at 70,000, including 10,000 cavalry.&lt;ref name=Laz227/&gt; Meanwhile, Connolly derives a number of 120,000 from the same-sized camp.&lt;ref name=Con&gt;Connolly, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, most estimates for the total Persian force are generally in this range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/ancient/plataea/default.aspx Military History Online website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, pp. 240–260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Del/&gt; For instance, Delbrück, based on the distance the Persians marched in a day when Athens was attacked, concluded that 75,000 was the upper limit for the size of the Persian army, including the supply personnel and other non-combatants.&lt;ref name=Del&gt;Delbrück, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategic and tactical considerations ==
In some ways the run-up to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a prolonged stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites did not want to risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt;&lt;ref name=L217/&gt;

According to Herodotus, both sides wished for a decisive battle that would tip the war in their favor.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt;&lt;ref name=IX41&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.41&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.41]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lazenby believed that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy.&lt;ref name=L217&gt;Lazenby, pp. 217–219&lt;/ref&gt; He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case).&lt;ref name=L221&gt;Lazenby, pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle and that he could simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter).&lt;ref name=L217/&gt; There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt;&lt;ref name=IX41/&gt; Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.

When Mardonius' raids disrupted the Allied supply chain, it forced the Allies to rethink their strategy. Rather than now moving to attack, however, they instead looked to retreat and secure their lines of communication.&lt;ref name=IX51/&gt; Despite this defensive move by the Greeks, it was in fact the chaos resulting from this retreat that finally ended the stalemate. Mardonius perceived this as a full-on retreat, in effect thinking that the battle was already over, and sought to pursue the Greeks.&lt;ref name=IX58&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.58&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.58]&lt;/ref&gt; Since he did not expect the Greeks to fight, the tactical problems were no longer an issue and he tried to take advantage of the altered strategic situation he thought he had produced.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt; Conversely, the Greeks had, inadvertently, lured Mardonius into attacking them on the higher ground and, despite being outnumbered, were thus at a tactical advantage.&lt;ref name=h343/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp. 254–257&lt;/ref&gt;

== The battle ==
Once the Persians discovered that the Greeks had abandoned their positions and appeared to be in retreat, Mardonius decided to set off in immediate pursuit with the elite Persian infantry.&lt;ref name=IX59&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.59&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.59]&lt;/ref&gt; As he did so, the rest of the Persian army, unbidden, began to move forward.&lt;ref name=IX59/&gt; The Spartans and Tegeans had by now reached the Temple of Demeter.&lt;ref name=h350/&gt; The rearguard under [[Amompharetus]] began to withdraw from the ridge, under pressure from Persian cavalry, to join them.&lt;ref name=h350&gt;Holland, pp. 350–355&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias sent a messenger to the Athenians, asking them to join up with the Spartans.&lt;ref name=IX60&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.60&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.60-61]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Athenians had been engaged by the Theban phalanx and were unable to assist Pausanias.&lt;ref name=h350/&gt; The Spartans and Tegeans were first assaulted by the Persian cavalry,&lt;ref name=IX60/&gt; while the Persian infantry made their way forward. They then planted their shields and began shooting arrows at the Greeks, while the cavalry withdrew.&lt;ref name=IX60/&gt;&lt;ref name=h350/&gt;

[[File:Battle of Plataea part 2.PNG|thumb|300px|right|The main phase of the battle at Plataea. The Greek retreat becomes disorganised, and the Persians cross the Asopus to attack.]]

According to Herodotus, Pausanias refused to advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed.&lt;ref name=IX61&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.61&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.61]&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, as Greek soldiers began to fall under the barrage of arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines.&lt;ref name=IX61/&gt; Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens in front of the Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.&lt;ref name=IX62&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.62&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.62-63]&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerically superior Persian infantry were of the heavy (by Persian standards) [[sparabara]] formation, but this was still much lighter than the Greek [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]].&lt;ref name=IX62/&gt; The Persian defensive weapon was a large wicker shield and they used short spears; by contrast, the hoplites were armored in bronze, with a bronze shield and a long spear.&lt;ref name=h350/&gt; As at Marathon, it was a severe mismatch.&lt;ref name=IX62/&gt;&lt;ref name=IX65/&gt; The fight was fierce and long, but the Greeks (Spartans and Tegeans) continued to push into the Persian lines.&lt;ref name=h350/&gt; The Persians tried to break the Greeks' spears by grabbing hold of them, but the Greeks responded by switching to swords.&lt;ref name=IX62/&gt; Mardonius was present at the scene, riding a white horse, and surrounded by a bodyguard of 1,000 men; while he remained, the Persians stood their ground.&lt;ref name=IX62/&gt; However, the Spartans closed in on Mardonius; a Spartan soldier named [[aeimnestus|Arimnestus]] saw him astride his horse, picked up a large rock off the ground and threw it hard at Mardonius; it hit him squarely in the head, killing him.&lt;ref name=IX63&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D63 IX.63-64]&lt;/ref&gt; With Mardonius dead, the Persians began to flee; although his bodyguard remained, they were annihilated.&lt;ref name=h350/&gt; Herodotus claims that the reason for their discomfort was a lack of armour. Quickly the rout became general, with many Persians fleeing in disorder to their camp.&lt;ref name=IX65&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.65&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.65]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Artabazos I of Phrygia|Artabazus]] (who had earlier commanded the [[Siege of Potidea|Sieges]] of [[Olynthus]] and [[Potidea]]), had disagreed with Mardonius about attacking the Greeks,&lt;ref name=IX58/&gt; and he had not fully engaged the forces under his command.&lt;ref name=IX66&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.66&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.66]&lt;/ref&gt; As the rout commenced, he led these men (40,000, according to Herodotus) away from the battlefield, on the road to Thessaly, hoping to escape eventually to the Hellespont.&lt;ref name=IX66/&gt;

On the opposite side of the battlefield the Athenians had triumphed in a tough battle against the Thebans.&lt;ref name=IX67&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.67&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX, 67]&lt;/ref&gt; The other Greeks fighting for the Persians had deliberately fought badly, according to Herodotus.&lt;ref name=IX67/&gt; The Thebans retreated from the battle, but in a different direction from the Persians, allowing them to escape without further losses.&lt;ref name=IX68&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.68&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.68]&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied Greeks, reinforced by the contingents who had not taken part in the main battle, then stormed the Persian camp.&lt;ref name=h350/&gt;&lt;ref name=IX69&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.69&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.69]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Persians initially defended the wall vigorously, it was eventually breached; the Persians, packed tightly together in the camp, were slaughtered by the Greeks.&lt;ref name=IX70&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.70&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.70]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Persians who had retreated to the camp, scarcely 3,000 were left alive.&lt;ref name=IX70/&gt;

According to Herodotus, only 43,000 Persians survived the battle.&lt;ref name=IX70/&gt; The number who died, of course, depends on how many there were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by Herodotus' reckoning. Herodotus claims that the Greeks as a whole lost only 159 men.&lt;ref name=IX70/&gt; Furthermore, he claims that only Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians died, since they were the only ones who fought.&lt;ref name=IX70/&gt; [[Plutarch]], who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 Greek casualties,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0009%3Achapter%3D19%3Asection%3D4 Aristides 19.4]&lt;/ref&gt; while both [[Ephorus]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]] tally the Greek casualties to over 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D33%3Asection%3D1 XI.33.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accounts of individuals ==
Herodotus recounts several anecdotes about the conduct of specific Spartans during the battle.
* '''[[Amompharetus]]''': The leader of a battalion of Spartans, he refused to undertake the night-time retreat towards Plataea before the battle, since doing so would be shameful for a Spartan.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.53&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.53]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus has an angry debate continuing between Pausanias and Amompharetus until dawn, whereupon the rest of the Spartan army finally began to retreat, leaving Amompharetus' division behind.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.56&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.56]&lt;/ref&gt; Not expecting this, Amompharetus eventually led his men after the retreating Spartans.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.97&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.97]&lt;/ref&gt; However, another tradition remembers Amompharetus as winning great renown at Plataea, and it has thus been suggested that Amompharetus, far from being insubordinate, had instead volunteered to guard the rear.&lt;ref name=h350/&gt;
* '''[[Aristodemus (Spartan)|Aristodemus]]''': The lone Spartan survivor of the slaughter of the 300 at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] had, with a fellow Spartiate, been dismissed from the army by [[Leonidas I]] because of an eye infection. However, his colleague had insisted on being led into battle, partially blind, by a helot.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.229&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 VII.229]&lt;/ref&gt; Preferring to return to Sparta, Aristodemus was branded a coward and suffered a year of reproach before Plataea.&lt;ref name=h350/&gt; Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the Persian lines by himself, killing in a savage fury before being cut down.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.71&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.71]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Spartans agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded him no special honour, because he failed to fight in the disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.&lt;ref name=h350/&gt;
* '''Callicrates''': Considered the &quot;most beautiful man, not among the Spartans only, but in the whole Greek camp&quot;, Callicrates was eager to distinguish himself that day as a warrior but was deprived of the chance by a stray arrow that pierced his side while standing in formation. When the battle commenced he insisted on making the charge with the rest, but collapsed within a short distance. His last words, according to Herodotus, were, &quot;I grieve not because I have to die for my country, but because I have not lifted my arm against the enemy.&quot;&lt;ref name=IX72&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.72&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.72]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{Main|Battle of Mycale|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}
[[File:Greek-Persian duel.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Greek hoplite and Persian warrior depicted fighting on an ancient [[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]. 5th century BC]]

According to Herodotus, the Battle of Mycale occurred on the same afternoon as Plataea.
A Greek fleet under the Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to challenge the remnants of the Persian fleet.&lt;ref name=IX96&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.96&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.96]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of [[Mycale|Mount Mycale]] in [[Ionia]]. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships.&lt;ref name=IX96/&gt; However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines.&lt;ref name=h357&gt;Holland, pp. 357–358&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force.&lt;ref name=h357/&gt; The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.&lt;ref name=h357/&gt;

With the twin victories of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, the threat of future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time it became apparent that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished.&lt;ref name=h358/&gt;

The remnants of the Persian army, under the command of Artabazus, tried to retreat back to [[Asia Minor]]. Travelling through the lands of Thessaly, Macedonia and Thrace by the shortest road, Artabazus eventually made it back to [[Byzantium]], though losing many men to Thracian attacks, weariness and hunger.&lt;ref name=IX89&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.89&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.89]&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this had already been done.&lt;ref name=IX114&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.114&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.114]&lt;/ref&gt; The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the [[Thracian Chersonese|Chersonesos]], still held by the Persians.&lt;ref name=IX114/&gt; The Persians in the region, and their allies, made for [[Sestos]], the strongest town in the region, and the Athenians laid siege to them there. After a protracted siege Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking the beginning of a new phase in the Greco-Persian Wars, the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Greek counterattack (479–478 BC)|Greek counterattack]].&lt;ref name=h359&gt;Holland, pp. 359–363&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus ended his ''Histories'' after the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Sestos|Siege of Sestos]]. Over the next 30 years the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated [[Delian League]], would expel (or help expel) the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia.&lt;ref name=h359/&gt; Peace with Persia came in 449&amp;nbsp;BC with the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Peace with Persia|Peace of Callias]], finally ending a half-century of warfare.&lt;ref name=h359/&gt;

== Significance ==
Plataea and Mycale have great significance in ancient history as the battles that decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging the balance of the Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. They kept Persia from conquering all of Greece, although they paid a high price by losing many of their men.&lt;ref name=h359/&gt; The Battle of Marathon showed that the Persians ''could'' be defeated, and the Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Plataea and Mycale that effectively ended that threat.&lt;ref name=h359/&gt; However, neither of these battles is nearly as well known as [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] or [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, based on the number of [[Google hit]]s, or the number of books  written specifically about those battles&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might, however, be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers;&lt;ref name = hxvi&gt;Holland, pp. ''xvi''–''xvii''.&lt;/ref&gt; and Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; the Greeks, in fact, sought out battle on both occasions.&lt;ref name=h336/&gt;&lt;ref name=h359/&gt;

Militarily, the major lesson of both Plataea and Mycale (since both were fought on land) was to re-emphasise the superiority of the [[hoplite]] over the more lightly armed Persian infantry, as had first been demonstrated at Marathon.&lt;ref name=h358&gt;Holland, pp. 358–359&lt;/ref&gt; Taking on this lesson, after the Greco-Persian Wars the Persian empire started recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0202;query=chapter%3D%231;layout=;loc=1.2.1 Anabasis]&lt;/ref&gt;  One such mercenary expedition, the &quot;[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis of the 10,000]]&quot; as narrated by [[Xenophon]], further proved to the Greeks that the Persians were militarily vulnerable even well within their own territory, and paved the way for the destruction of the Persian Empire by [[Alexander the Great]] some decades later.

=== Monuments to the battle ===
{{Main|Serpent Column}}
A bronze column in the shape of intertwined snakes (the [[Serpent column]]) was created from melted-down Persian weapons,  acquired in the plunder of the Persian camp, and was erected at [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.81&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.81]&lt;/ref&gt; It commemorated all the Greek city-states that had participated in the battle, listing them on the column, and thus confirming some of Herodotus' claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;IX, 81&quot;&gt;See Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.81&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 IX.81], note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of it still survives in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]] of [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]]), where it was carried by [[Constantine the Great]] during the founding of his city on the Greek colony of Byzantium.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, chapters 17 and 68&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources ==
{{Main|Herodotus}}
The main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} Cicero, On the Laws [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0030%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D5 I.5]&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—''Historia''; English—''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; As Holland has it: &quot;For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally&quot;.&lt;ref name=hxvi/&gt;

Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0105%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D22 I.22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fin15&gt;Finley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.&lt;ref name = Fin15/&gt; [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay &quot;On The Malignity of Herodotus&quot;, describing Herodotus as &quot;''Philobarbaros''&quot; (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. ''xxiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.&lt;ref name = h377&gt;Holland, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.&lt;ref name = h377/&gt; Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Fehling, pp. 1–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian historian, [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Battle of Plataea. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's, but given that it was written much later, it may well have been derived from Herodotus's version.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+11.28&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 XI.28–34]&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle is also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and is alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]] also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;IX, 81&quot; /&gt;
