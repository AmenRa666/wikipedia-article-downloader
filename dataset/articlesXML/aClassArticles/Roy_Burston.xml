[[Major General (Australia)|Major-General]] '''Sir Samuel Roy Burston''', {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|KBE|CB|DSO|KStJ|VD|FRCP|FRCPE|FRACP}} (21 March 1888 – 21 August 1960) was an Australian soldier, [[physician]], and [[Thoroughbred racing in Australia|horse racing]] identity.

The son of a prominent [[Melbourne]] soldier and businessman, Burston graduated from the [[University of Melbourne]] with a [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] in 1910. After graduation he worked with children at the [[Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide|Adelaide Children's Hospital]] and [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people]] in the [[Northern Territory]].

Having served with the Militia from an early age, he obtained a commission in the [[Royal Australian Army Medical Corps|Australian Army Medical Corps]] in 1912 and served as a medical officer in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during World War I. Burston was [[mentioned in despatches]] and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for supervising an advanced dressing station under fire during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. After the war he became a foundation [[Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians]]. During World War II he served as Director of Medical Services in the Middle East and Director General of Medical Services in Australia with the rank of major general. The [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]] was withdrawn from the [[Siege of Tobruk]] on his medical advice. He remained Director General of Medical Services until 1948. In 1945, he became Chief Commissioner of [[St John Ambulance Australia]], serving until 1957,

Burston was involved in [[Thoroughbred racing in Australia|thoroughbred racing]] both as a [[Gambler|punter]] and as a racehorse owner. He served as Chairman of the [[Moonee Valley Racing Club]] from 1952 until his death in 1960. Burston made the [[W S Cox Plate]] the richest [[Weight for Age|weight for age]] race in Australia, and he oversaw the construction of the Burston Grandstand, which was named in his honour.

==Education and early life==
Samuel Roy Burston was born in [[Melbourne]] on 21 March 1888, the fourth of seven children to [[James Burston]], a businessman who served as [[List of mayors and lord mayors of Melbourne|Lord Mayor of Melbourne]] from 1908 to 1910, and his wife Marianne, née McBean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070498b.htm |title=Burston, James (1856–1920), Australian Dictionary of Biography |accessdate=30 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy always preferred to be known by his first name rather than as Samuel, which was the name of his grandfather.{{sfn|Howie-Willis|2012|p=viii}} The family lived in [[Flinders Street, Melbourne]] and later in [[Hawthorn, Victoria]]. James Burston would go on to command the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Infantry Brigade]] in the Gallipoli Campaign and rise to the rank of major general. Roy was educated at [[Melbourne Grammar School]], where he acquired the nickname &quot;Ginger&quot; after his [[red hair]]. He joined the [[Colonial forces of Australia#Victoria|Victorian Military Forces]] as a [[bugler]] in 1900, serving with them and the [[Australian Army|Australian Military Forces]] until 1905.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot; /&gt; He considered a full-time military career but this was precluded by the discovery of a [[heart murmur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|Keogh|Jose|Irving|1961|pp=184–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Melbourne Grammar in 1903, Burston entered University of Melbourne in 1905, where he lived at [[Trinity College (University of Melbourne)|Trinity College]] and studied medicine.{{sfn|Howie-Willis|2012|pp=33–35}}  He graduated with his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees in June 1910,&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130354b.htm |title=Burston, Sir Samuel Roy (1888–1960), Australian Dictionary of Biography |accessdate=30 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after his graduation he became a [[Residency (medicine)|resident medical officer]] at [[Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide|Adelaide Children's Hospital]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt;  In 1911 and 1912, he served in the [[Northern Territory]] as a medical inspector of [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] with the [[Aboriginal Protection Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3268293 |title=Protectors of Aborigines. |newspaper=[[The Northern Territory Times|Northern Territory Times and Gazette (Darwin, NT : 1873 – 1927)]] |location=Darwin, NT  |date=29 March 1912 |accessdate=3 June 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to [[Adelaide]] where he married Helen Elizabeth Culross on 16 April 1913 in St Michael's [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Church at [[Mitcham, South Australia]]. He took up [[general practice]] in [[Mile End, South Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt; Although unable to pursue a military career, he obtained a commission as a [[Captain (Land)|captain]] in the Australian Army Medical Corps (AAMC) on 14 October 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot;&gt;''The Army List of Officers of the Australian Military Forces'', October 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
Burston joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] as a [[major]] in the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance on 26&amp;nbsp;March 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot; /&gt; He embarked for [[Egypt]] on the transport ''Borda'' on 23 June 1915. In September, he went to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] with the 7th Field Ambulance, which supported his father's [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Infantry Brigade]]. He served on Gallipoli from September until November, when he was evacuated to [[Alexandria]] and later England with [[Typhoid fever]].&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel file&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Samuel Roy Burston Personnel File, NAA B883 VX2 |url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=6231489&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1 |accessdate=6 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burston remained in hospital until September 1916, when he was posted to the 11th Field Ambulance, part of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]], then training at [[Larkhill]] in England. He moved to France with this unit on 24 November 1916. For his conduct supervising an advanced dressing station the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]], Burston was [[mentioned in despatches]] and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30450|supp=yes|startpage=27|date=1 January 1918|accessdate=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His citation, signed by Major General [[John Monash]], read: {{quote|From 5 June 1917 to 12 June 1917 at [[Ploegsteert Wood]], this officer was in charge of the Advanced Dressing Station, Charing Cross. During the whole of that period he has set a fine example to the officers and other ranks with him. For the whole time the Advanced Dressing Station was under shell fire, both with [[Poison gas in World War I|gas shells]] and [[Explosive material|H.E.]], this bombardment being of the most intense character at times. On the night of 6/7th June during a particularly heavy gas shell bombardment, he carried through with complete success the organisation of the dressing station and the directing of the duties of those under him, supervising and assisting in the treatment and evacuation of the wounded and gassed. Through all this trying time he was compelled to wear a small box respirator on account of the density of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.awm.gov.au/honours/awm28/person.asp?p=6465 |title=Recommendation for Samuel Roy Burston to be awarded a Distinguished Service Order |date=16 June 1917 |accessdate=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later that month, Burston was appointed senior medical officer at the Australian General Base Depot at [[Le Havre]] with the temporary rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel file&quot; /&gt; This rank became substantive on 18 September 1917. He was made commander of the 1st Convalescent Depot on 18 April 1918 and of the 3rd General Hospital on 22 November 1918. On 7 April 1919, he became Assistant Director of Medical Services (ADMS), AIF Depots in the United Kingdom with the temporary rank of [[colonel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot; /&gt; For this work, he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBE&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31684|supp=yes|startpage=15456|date=12 December 1919|accessdate=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to Australia aboard the ''Orsova'' on 22 November 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel file&quot; /&gt;

==Between the wars==
[[File:Burston and friends at Chiton Rocks Beach late 1920s.JPG|thumb|right|Samuel Burston (right) and his friends at Chiton Rocks Beach. Note early [[bodyboard|boogie board]] technology.]] 
Burston was promoted to major in the AAMC on 1 July 1919, lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1920, and colonel on 1 September 1921. He assumed the post of Deputy Director of Medical Services, 4th Military District in [[South Australia]] on 1 August 1921, a post he was to hold until 12 October 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot; /&gt;

On returning to Adelaide in 1919, he was reappointed to the staff of the Adelaide Children's Hospital. He also resumed as an honorary assistant physician at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, a post he had been appointed to in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, he travelled to Scotland to further his medical knowledge, and become a member of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]]. On returning to Australia, he became an honorary physician at Royal Adelaide Hospital. He also began lecturing at the [[University of Adelaide]]. He was a district officer of the [[St John Ambulance Brigade]], and vice president of the South Australian branch of the [[Australian Nursing Federation]]. In 1937 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and then one of  the 41 foundation [[Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians|Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|pp=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also honorary physician to the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] from 1 July 1939 to 11 February 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot; /&gt;

Burston was a member of the [[Adelaide Club]], [[South Australian Cricket Association]] and the [[Melbourne Club]]. He was a committee member of the Adelaide amateur Turf Club, and made an annual trip back to Melbourne for the [[Melbourne Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tall man at {{height|ft=6|in=2}},&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel file&quot; /&gt; he was awarded the [[Royal Humane Society]] of Australasia's Bronze Medal for saving the life of a youth caught in the [[Rip current|rip]] while [[surfing]] at [[Victor Harbor, South Australia]] in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article56768081 |title=Royal Humane Society |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide  |date=8 September 1928 |accessdate=3 June 2012 |page=16 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had three children: Samuel Gerald Wood (Sam) Burston became a grazier; Robin Archibald (Bob) Burston became a physician like his father; and Helen Elizabeth (Betty), who married Chris Sangster, an Adelaide physician on 12 January 1939.

==World War II==

===Middle East===
[[File:Senior Officers 1940.jpg|thumb|right|Embarkation for the Middle East. Left to right: Brigadier Rowell, Colonel Burston, Major Knight and General Blamey.]]
In October 1939, the Director General of Medical Services (DGMS), Major General [[Rupert Downes]], tapped Burston for the post of Assistant Director of Medical Services (ADMS) of the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot; /&gt; Burston officially joined the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] on 13 October 1939 with the rank of colonel, and received the serial number VX2 (VX1 being Lieutenant General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot; /&gt; When [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]] was formed in April 1940, Burston was appointed to its staff as Deputy Director of Medical Services (DDMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1952|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he was promoted to [[Brigadier]] on 1 July 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot; /&gt;

Burston departed for the Middle East by [[Qantas]] [[flying boat]] along with Blamey and Brigadier [[Sydney Rowell]] on 12 June 1940, the party wearing civilian clothes as they were travelling through neutral countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hetherington|1973|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Blamey organised a Headquarters, AIF in the Middle East and appointed Burston as its Director of Medical Services (DMS). The [[Australian Government]] had appointed Major General [[Rupert Downes]] to this post, but it deferred to Blamey.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1953|pp=339, 419–420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burston was promoted to Major General on 16 February 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradation list&quot; /&gt;

Burston believed in personal reconnaissance and leading from the front. He was at the forefront of providing the medical arrangements for [[Operation Compass]]. He attempted, in the face of equipment shortages, to anticipate medical problems and so far as possible to prevent or avoid them. He dispatched Major [[Ian Murray Mackerras]] to investigate fly breeding in order to prevent an outbreak of [[diarrhoea]]. Burston gave Mackerras a free hand to tackle hygiene problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1953|pp=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=One day he had to lay before the Old Man details of two complex medical schemes. Blamey gave the papers a cursory glance, and initialled each set without asking a question. Burston exclaimed in spontaneous surprise at this unhesitating acceptance of important proposals.
&quot;How long have you known me now, Ginger?&quot; Blamey asked.
Burston told him.
&quot;Well, surely you have formed a better estimate of me than that!&quot; Blamey said. &quot;You are my technical advisor on medical problems. You don't think that I'd be stupid enough to join issue with you on your own ground, do you? I assume before you come to me with things like these that you have given them every thought.&quot;

}}
His participation in the [[Battle of Greece]] was of brief duration; he embarked on 10 April 1941 and was back less than two weeks later.&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel file&quot; /&gt; While there, he visited the front and was caught up in an air raid at [[Elassona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt; The disaster in Greece greatly exacerbated the ongoing problem of medical equipment, as losses included the complete equipment of three field ambulances, two casualty clearing stations, a 600-bed hospital and one 1200-bed general hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1953|pp=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In July 1941, Burston reported that Australians on leave in Cairo from the [[Siege of Tobruk]] were underweight, and expressed doubts that the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]] might have the physical stamina to resist an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hetherington|1973|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burston and Colonel [[Neil Hamilton Fairley]] met with the 9th Division's commander, Major General [[Leslie Morshead]], as did Blamey,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maughan|1966|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that Blamey sought its relief. This led to showdowns first between Blamey and General Sir [[Claude Auchinleck]], and then between the British and Australian governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hetherington|1973|pp=180–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burston was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 14 April 1942;&lt;ref name=&quot;CB&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35526|startpage=1691|date=14 April 1942|accessdate=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; his citation, written by Blamey, read:
{{quote|Since the inception of the AIF in October 1939, Major General Burston has held the senior medical appointment in the AIF. He has been responsible for the organisation, training and administration of the medical services of the AIF in their entirety.  The efficient medical arrangements at present existing in the AIF in the Middle East are due to his enthusiasm, tireless energy, far-sightedness, and administrative ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel file&quot; /&gt;}}

===South West Pacific===
[[File:HQ I Corps AWM011887.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters I Corps on the deck of the ''Orcades''. Major General Burston is in the front row, centre.]]
Burston departed the Middle East for [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] on 22 January 1942. He narrowly avoided capture when it fell, departing on the ''Orcades'' on 21 February 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel file&quot; /&gt; On 8 May 1942, Burston became DGMS at GHQ (Australia), which soon became Land Headquarters (LHQ). In this position, he found himself in charge of officers like Downes who were senior to him militarily, and others like Fairley and Mackerras who &quot;were, in truth, superior to him in intellectual distinction and professional status.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt;

He made numerous visits to the front in [[Papua-New Guinea]], during September, November and December 1942, July 1943, and June 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel file&quot; /&gt; On his visit to Papua in September 1942, Blamey asked Burston to intercede with Rowell, the relationship between Blamey and Rowell having broken down as a result of the Rowell's supersession by Blamey on the orders of [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] and [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Curtin]]. Burston failed to placate Rowell, and Rowell was relieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hetherington|1973|pp=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1942 Papuan campaign threw up a host of serious medical problems. The poor diet, mainly caused by the difficulty of supply by air or over jungle tracks, caused malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1952|pp=320–324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor hygiene led to dysentery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1952|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaria was hyperendemic, and when Fairley and Mackerras visited Papua in June 1942 they found high rates of infection among the troops even before the fighting had begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1952|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Milne Bay]] the incidence was so high in September 1942 that it looked like the garrison would be wiped out in a matter of months.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1952|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest killer, though, was typhus. Of the 2,839 soldiers who came down with it, 257 (9 percent) died.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1952|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; It fell to Burston promulgate the policies and practices that diminished the danger from disease and allowed the Australian Army to fight in New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|pp=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1945, Burston visited [[South East Asia Command]], and then travelled to the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel file&quot; /&gt; where he ratified a series of agreements on the exchange of information regarding the development of new drugs, and for the funding of research scholarships by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardiner|1990|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was returning to Australia when the war ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel file&quot; /&gt;

Burston was appointed a Knight of Grace of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;KStJ&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36315|startpage=114|date=4 January 1944|accessdate=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became Chief Commissioner of [[St John Ambulance Australia]] in March 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43482933 |title=St John Ambulance State Commissioner |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide  |date=2 March 1945 |accessdate=3 June 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving until 1957, after which he became Receiver-General of the Priory in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot; /&gt; He became an Honorary [[Physician to the King]] in August 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51764815 |title=Hon. Physician to King. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth  |date=23 August 1945 |accessdate=3 June 2012 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blamey recommended Burston for a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in September 1945, along with [[Frank Berryman]], [[James Harold Cannan|James Cannan]], [[John Northcott]], [[Jack Stevens]] and [[George Wootten]]. The recommendation was turned down by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government as it was not Labor Party policy to award knighthoods at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horner|1998|p=559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election of the [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] government in the [[Australian federal election, 1949|1949 election]], Blamey wrote to the new [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[Robert Menzies]], again requesting honours for his generals. This time he was successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horner|1998|p=579}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Burston was appointed Knight Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (military division) in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;KBE&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39422|supp=yes|startpage=37|date=28 December 1951|accessdate=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burston remained DGMS after the war. In the immediate post-war period, he was responsible for the demobilisation of the Army Medical Services,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|pp=359–360}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for providing medical support to the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|pp=366–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the medical arrangements, which Burston felt might lead to the force being prematurely withdrawn, led to Burston being publicly rebuked by the Army Minister, [[Cyril Chambers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49354900 |title=Minister Rebukes General. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane  |date=24 February 1947 |accessdate=3 June 2012 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burston retired as DGMS and from the Army in 1948, handing over to [[Kingsley Norris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as honorary colonel of the [[Royal Australian Army Medical Corps]] from 1952 to 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot; /&gt;

Rather than resume his medical practice in Adelaide, Burston chose to remain in Melbourne. In 1950, he delivered the [[Rupert Downes]] Memorial Lecture based on his book on ''Medical Aspects of Atomic Warfare''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rupert Downes Memorial Lecture and Medal |url=http://www.surgeons.org/Content/NavigationMenu/WhoWeAre/AwardsLecturesandPrizes/rupert_downes.pdf |accessdate=16 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burston served as director of several companies, including David Syme &amp; Co. (the publisher of ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper), [[WMC Resources|Western Mining Corporation]], Great Western Consolidated, New Coolgardie, and Koolgardie Southern. He was a medical advisor to the [[Australian Red Cross]] and National Mutual Life Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt;

In retirement, Burston enjoyed playing [[golf]] and [[tennis]], and was involved in [[Thoroughbred racing in Australia|thoroughbred racing]], both as a [[Gambling|punter]] and as a racehorse owner.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt; He was elected Chairman of the [[Moonee Valley Racing Club]] following the death of C. F. (Charlie) Taylor in 1952. Burston increased the prize money of the [[Cox Plate]], taking £1,000 from the [[Moonee Valley Cup]] and adding another £1,000 to give the two races equal prize money of £4,000. This made the Cox Plate the richest [[Weight for Age|weight for age]] race in Australia. In announcing the decision, Burston described the prize money as &quot;fitting to the class of horses competing&quot;, noting that it had drawn fields with winners such as [[Phar Lap]] in 1930 and 1931; [[Chatham (horse)|Chatham]] in 1932 and 1934; [[Ajax II|Ajax]] in 1938; [[Flight (horse)|Flight]] in 1945 and 1946; and [[Hydrogen (horse)|Hydrogen]], the 1952 winner that would go on to win it again in 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkwood|Meldrum, p. 27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kirkwood|Meldrum|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Burston announced a long range plan to increase the prize money to £10,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkwood|Meldrum, p. 28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kirkwood|Meldrum|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this would not be achieved until 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkwood|Meldrum, p. 30&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kirkwood|Meldrum|2000|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds at the race meetings at Moonee Valley had fallen from an average of 35,000 per meeting in 1948–49 to 25,000 in 1952–53.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkwood|Meldrum, p. 27&quot; /&gt; To lure punters back, the club expanded facilities. A new public grandstand, named the Burston Grandstand in his honour, was built at a cost of £200,000. This facility was first used for the [[Cox Plate]] meeting in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkwood|Meldrum, p. 28&quot; /&gt;

Burston died at his home in [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]] from a ruptured [[aortic aneurysm]] on 21 August 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howie-Willis, pp. 387-388&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|pp=387–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his daughter Elizabeth, who was married to Dr Christopher Sangster, an Adelaide physician, and his sons Samuel (later Sir Samuel Burston), a [[pastoral farming|pastoralist]] in the [[Western District, Victoria|Western District]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and Robin, a physician at [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt; A [[military funeral]] was held at Christ Church, South Yarra on 25 August. Burston's  pall bearers included Major Generals [[Leslie Beavis]], [[George Canet]], [[Ronald McNicoll]], Kingsley Norris, [[William Refshauge]], [[Robert Risson]] and [[Colin Hall Simpson|Colin Simpson]]. Mourners included Lieutenant General Sir [[John Northcott]]; [[William Samuel Cox]], representing the Moonee Valley Racing Club; and Sir [[Frederick William Thomas (politician)|Frederick Thomas]], the [[Lord Mayor of Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|pp=390–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burston's remains were [[cremated]] at the [[Springvale Crematorium]], and his ashes were placed with those of Helen, who had died in 1958, in the gardens there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howie-Willis, pp. 387-388&quot;/&gt; A portrait by Sir [[William Dargie]] was purchased by a fund subscribed to by a large number of medical officers and presented to him at The Australasian Medical Congress in [[Perth, Western Australia]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt; Today, it is at the [[Latchford Barracks]]. A 1990 portrait by Barbara August hangs in the boardroom of the Moonee Valley Racing Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howie-Willis|2012|pp=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, by Sir [[Ivor Hele]], is held by the [[Australian War Memorial]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot; /&gt;
