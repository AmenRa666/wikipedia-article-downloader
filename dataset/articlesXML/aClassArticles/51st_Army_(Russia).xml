The '''51st Army''' was a [[field army]] of the [[Red Army]] that saw action against the [[Germans]] in [[World War II]] on both the southern and northern sectors of the front. The army participated in the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula]] between December 1941 and January 1942; it was destroyed in May 1942 with other Soviet forces when the Wehrmacht launched an operation to dislodge them from the peninsula.&lt;ref name=Incompetent&gt;Erickson, p.349, and I.Malashenko, Military Thought, Vol. 12, No.4, 2003 (Eastview Press translation)&lt;/ref&gt; The army fought in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] during the winter of 1942–43, helping to defeat German relief attempts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; From late 1944 to the end of the war, the army fought in  the final cutting-off of German forces in the [[Courland Pocket|Courland area]] next to the Baltic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 51-я армия: Боевой путь 51-й армии|last = Sarkisyan|first = Semyon Mkrtichevich|publisher = Voenizdat|year = 1983|isbn = |location = Moscow|pages = |url = http://militera.lib.ru/h/sarkisyan_sm01/index.html|trans-title = 51st Army: 51st Army fighting|language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inactivated in 1945, the army was activated again in 1977 to secure [[Sakhalin]] and the [[Kuril Islands]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the army continued in existence as a component of the [[Russian Ground Forces]].  The army was active during two periods from 1941 until 1997.

==The Crimea==
{{See also|Battle of Sevastopol#The assault on Perekop}}
The Army was ordered formed on 14 August 1941 in the Crimea based on the [[9th Rifle Corps]] and other units as the 51st Independent Army under [[Fyodor Isodorovich Kuznetsov|Colonel General F.I. Kuznetsov]], with the task of guarding the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. [[Pavel Batov]] was appointed as his deputy.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkisyan 1983, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[John Erickson (historian)|John Erickson]] in ''The Road to Stalingrad'' describes Stalin's rationale for the formation of the Army during a 12 August session within the [[Stavka]] war room: Stalin and the Stavka had concluded from the German moves underway at the time that a strike on the Crimea (along with an attack on [[Bryansk]]) was likely, and thus the formation of an Independent Army in the Crimea had been decided upon. Thus Kuznetsov was summoned, and after a discussion, he was sent south to take up his new command.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Erickson (historian)]], The Road to Stalingrad, Cassel Military Paperbacks, 2003, pp.198–199&lt;/ref&gt;

The army's initial forces included the 9th Rifle Corps, the [[271st Rifle Division|271st]] and [[276th Rifle Division]]s, the [[40th Cavalry Division (Soviet Union)|40th]], [[42nd Cavalry Division (Soviet Union)|42nd]] and [[48th Cavalry Division (Soviet Union)|48th Cavalry Divisions]], and the [[320th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|1st]], 2nd, 3rd and 4th irregularly formed Crimean divisions&lt;ref&gt;Alex aka AMVAS, [http://www.armchairgeneral.com/rkkaww2/formation/DNO.htm Irregular Units of RKKA], updated 5 January 2004. 4th Crimean Division eventually became [[184th Rifle Division]].&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of smaller units. However, due to what Erickson describes as Kuznetsov's 'sticking blindly to the prewar plan', which anticipated a seaborne assault, and leaving the [[Perekop]] and [[Syvash|Sivash]] approaches too thinly held, [[Erich von Manstein]], leading the German assault, was able to push past the defenses.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, 2003, p.256&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Stavka ordered that the army command be handed over to Batov.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, 2003, p.287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November the army was evacuated from the [[Taman Peninsula]] and it joined the [[Transcaucasian Front]] (briefly known as the Caucasian Front after 30 December 1941). The army participated in the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|Kerch-Feodosiya landing operation]] in December 1941&amp;nbsp;– January 1942 alongside the [[44th Army (Soviet Union)|44th Army]]. 51st Army was originally planned to be the Kerch arm of the assault, but delays caused by bad weather and a schedule change prompted by renewed German attacks on Sevastopol resulted in 51st Army troops being landed at Capes Sjuk and Chroni during the night of 26–27 December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Grechko|Gretschko]], Geschichte des Zweiten Welt Krieges (Soviet official history of World War II), Volume 4, 1977, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The 44th and 51st Armies then formed the [[Crimean Front]] under General [[Dmitry Timofeyevich Kozlov|Dmitri T. Kozlov]], formally established on 28 January 1942, which hammered repeatedly at Von Manstein's [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|Eleventh Army]]. On 1 February 1942, 51st Army comprised the [[138th Rifle Division|138th]] and [[302nd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|302nd Mountain Rifle Divisions]], the [[224th Rifle Division|224th]], [[390th Rifle Division|390th]], and [[396th Rifle Division]]s, the 12th Rifle Brigade, 83rd Naval Infantry Brigade, 105th Separate Mountain Rifle Regiment, 55th Tank Brigade, 229th Separate Tank Battalion, artillery units, and other support units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://bdsa.ru/%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA-(%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%8F%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9)/3751-1-1942-1863|title = Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1 February 1942|publisher = bdsa.ru|date = |accessdate = 31 December 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151231220951/http://bdsa.ru/%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA-(%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%8F%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9)/3751-1-1942-1863|archivedate = 31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German offensive was launched against the Front on 8 May 1942.

Three armies (44th, 47th, and 51st), 21 divisions, 176,000 men, 347 tanks, and nearly 3,500 guns were lost.&lt;ref name=Incompetent /&gt; The remains of the force were evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Robert |last=Forczyk |title=Sevastopol 1942: Von Manstein's Triumph |year=2008 |series=Campaign Series, No. 189 |publisher=Osprey |location =Oxford |ISBN=9781846032219 |p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stalingrad and after==
After the evacuation 51st Army joined the [[North Caucasian Front]] at Kuban. In July, Marshal [[Semyon Budyonny|Budenny]] received orders to combine the [[Southern Front (Soviet Union)|Southern Front]] and North Caucasian Front into a single formation retaining the title of North Caucasian Front, and 51st Army joined the 'Don group' of that front under General Lieutenant [[Rodion Malinovsky#Battle of Kharkov|Rodion Malinovsky]], along with the [[12th Army (Soviet Union)|12th Army]] and the [[37th Army (Soviet Union)|37th Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, The Road to Stalingrad, 2003, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July, army commander Major general [[Nikolai Trufanov]] was relieved of command.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Caucasus 1942–43: Kleist’s race for oil|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=E1XVBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Osprey Publishing|date = 2015-05-20|isbn = 9781472805836|first = Robert|last = Forczyk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Stalingrad Front]] (from 1–5 August), then briefly with the Southeast Front (from 6 August until 27 September), and then back with the Stalingrad Front it took part in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. On 31 July when it came under Stalingrad Front control it was so worn down by its previous rough handling that it was only 3,000 men strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stalingrad.ic.ru/s51arm.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030917172328/http://stalingrad.ic.ru/s51arm.html |archivedate=17 September 2003 |title=51st Army |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was attacked on the same day by the [[4th Panzer Army]], which was able to break through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stalingrad 1942|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7MA-QiI2jM8C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=51st+army&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinsKCev4jKAhUS5WMKHVwcCjY4ChDoAQghMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=51st%2520army&amp;f=false|publisher = Osprey Publishing|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9781846030284|first = Peter D.|last = Antill|page = 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Operation Uranus]], the counterattack from Stalingrad, the [[4th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|4th Mechanized Corps]] began its attack from the 51st Army's sector. In early December, 51st Army was deployed to cover the [[Kotelnikovo, Volgograd Oblast|Kotelnikovo]] approaches against German relief attempts by the [[LVII Panzerkorps|''LVII.

Trufanov, organized a local offensive operation on the right flank with the forces of three rifle divisions, and moved to the north bank of the Aksav River, on the eve of the Kotelnikovo offensive operation,&lt;ref&gt;Yashin, V.F.

On 30 January 1943, the ''Luftwaffe's'' ''[[Kampfgeschwader 51]]'' destroyed the 51st Army's Headquarters, near [[Salsk]]. Dropping 100&amp;nbsp;– 250&amp;nbsp;kg bombs, a wave of [[Junkers Ju 88]]s and [[Heinkel He 111]]s destroyed the communications center, working offices of the chief-of-staff, the operational headquarters and the offices of the operational duty officer. Up to 20 buildings and personnel billets were also destroyed. Casualties among personnel were also very high.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Christer (2007).

After January 1943 as part of the Southern Front, that became the [[4th Ukrainian Front]] on 20 October 1943, the 51st Army took part in the Rostov, Donbass (August–September 1943), [[Melitopol]] (September–November 1943) and the [[Battle of the Crimea (1944)|1944 Crimean offensive operation]]. On 1 April 1944, 51st Army included the [[1st Guards Rifle Corps]] (33rd Guards, [[91st Rifle Division|91st]] and [[346th Rifle Division]]s), [[10th Rifle Corps]] ([[216th Rifle Division|216th]], [[257th Rifle Division|257th]], and [[279th Rifle Division]]s), [[63rd Rifle Corps]] ([[263rd Rifle Division|263rd]], [[267th Rifle Division|267th]], and [[417th Rifle Division]]s), the [[77th Rifle Division]], the 78th Fortified Region, artillery, armor and other support units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://bdsa.ru/%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA-(%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%8F%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9)/3775-1-1944-1885|title = Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1 April 1944|publisher = bdsa.ru|date = |accessdate = 31 December 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151231220803/http://bdsa.ru/%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA-(%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%8F%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9)/3775-1-1944-1885|archivedate = 31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these operations, the 51st Army's attacks trapped the German ''XXIX.

The army was withdrawn to the [[Reserve of the Supreme High Command]] (''[[Stavka]]'' Reserve) on 20 May and relocated to the area of [[Polotsk]] and [[Vitebsk]] in Belarus.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = 51-я АРМИЯ|url = http://bdsa.ru/%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8/2822-51|website = bdsa.ru|accessdate = 2015-12-31|trans-title = 51st Army|language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[1st Baltic Front]] it participated in operations clearing [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]&amp;nbsp;– the [[Baltic Offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Belorussia 1944: The Soviet General Staff Study|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LnNyLS3NXQwC|publisher = Routledge|date = 2004-08-02|isbn = 9781134266746|first = David|last = Glantz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading the penetration of 1st Baltic Front into German lines, 51st Army reached the [[Bay of Riga]] on 31 July 1944, cutting off German [[Army Group North]] to the northeast of [[Riga]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Grechko|Gretschko]], Geschichte des Zweiten Welt Krieges (Soviet official history of World War II)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stalin's War with Germany: The Road to Berlin|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6UaU6ZLqK4UC|publisher = Yale University Press|date = 1999|isbn = 0300078137|first = John|last = Erickson|author-link = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under tremendous pressure, the Germans organized an armored counter-attack (''[[Operation Doppelkopf|Doppelkopf]]'') from 16 to 27 August 1944 that succeeded in re-opening a 40-kilometer wide corridor through which Army Group North retreated westward into the [[Courland]] region of Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Between Giants: The Battle for the Baltics in World War II|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=77ifAwAAQBAJ|publisher = Osprey Publishing|date = 2013-05-20|isbn = 9781780961637|first = Prit|last = Buttar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After regrouping in September 1944, the 51st Army attacked westward in October, reaching the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic coast]] north of [[Klaipėda|Memel]], and with other 1st Baltic Front armies, definitively cut off Army Group North in Courland, where the German force would remain for the rest of the war.  Thereafter, 51st Army took up position on the far western flank of the Soviet forces arrayed against Army Group North (later renamed [[Army Group Courland]]).  Of the six major [[Battle of Courland|battles for Courland]], 51st Army's only real progress was during the first Courland battle, from 15–22 October 1944, in which the army pushed some ten kilometers north against bitter resistance of the German ''[[III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps|III. SS-Panzerkorps]]''.  Thereafter, the front lines in this area of the Courland front changed little.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Frieser, Das Deutsche Reich und der Zweite Weltkrieg, Volume 8, 2007, pp. 650–654.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 9 May 1945 it accepted the capitulation of the German Army Group Courland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://samsv.narod.ru/Arm/a51/arm.html|title=51-я армия - страница клуба &quot;Память&quot; Воронежского госуниверситета|last=|first=|date=|website=samsv.narod.ru|publisher=|language=Russian|trans-title=51st Army - Home of the Club &quot;Memory&quot; Voronezh State University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173224/http://samsv.narod.ru/Arm/a51/arm.html|archive-date=3 March 2016|access-date=|accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
