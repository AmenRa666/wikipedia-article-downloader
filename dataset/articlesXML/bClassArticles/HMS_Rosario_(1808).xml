'''HMS ''Rosario''''' was a [[Cherokee class brig-sloop|''Cherokee''-class]] 10-gun [[brig]] of the [[Royal Navy]], launched in 1808. She served during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and participated in one engagement that earned her crew the NGSM. She was sold in 1832. 

==Napoleonic Wars==

She was commissioned in March 1809, under commander [[Booty Harvey]], for service in home waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-374794&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_ix.pdf|title=NMM, vessel ID 374794|work=Warship Histories, vol ix|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 1810, she engaged two French privateers in the English Channel. To avoid being captured, Harvey ran alongside one of the luggers, which he boarded and captured. This was the lugger ''Mamelouck'' of 16 guns, under the command of Norbez Lawrence.&lt;ref name=LG16434/&gt; The other lugger engaged ''Rosario'' on the starboard side but then was able to outrun ''Rosario'', which had lost her jib-boom during the boarding, and escape.&lt;ref&gt;James (1837), Vol. 5, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mamelouck'' had seven of her crew of 45 men wounded. ''Rosario'' had five men wounded, two severely. ''Mamelouck'' was only nine hours out of Boulogne and had not had captured anything.&lt;ref name=LG16434&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16434|startpage=1978|date=11 December 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 1811, ''Rosario'' was in company with {{HMS|Skylark|1806|6}} and {{HMS|Royalist|1807|6}} when ''Royalist'' captured the French privateer ''Rodeur'', of 14 guns and 60 men, between Dover and Calais after a two-hour chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16626|startpage=1445|date=25 July 1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the engagement ''Royalist'' had one man killed and five wounded; ''Rodeur'' lost one man killed and 11 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16553|startpage=2428|date=17 December 1811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 1812, near Dieppe, ''Rosario'' intercepted a 13-strong flotilla heading from Boulogne to Dieppe. With the aid of [[HMS Griffon (1808)|HMS ''Griffon'']], she engaged them closely, capturing three brigs ([[Pram (ship)|praams]] Nos. 95, 246, and 314),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16720|date=13 April 1813|startpage=754}}&lt;/ref&gt; and driving two more onto the shore. Each French brig was armed with three 24-pounder guns and an 8&quot; howitzer. The British casualties amounted to officer and four men wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16587|date=28 March 1812|startpage=593|endpage=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March, as a result, Harvey was promoted to [[post-captain]].&lt;ref&gt;James (1837), Vol. 5, pp. 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, the Admiralty awarded the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]] with clasp &quot;Rosario 27 March 1812&quot; to the seven surviving claimants from her crew. The admiralty also awarded the medal with clasp &quot;Griffon 27 March 1812&quot; to the five surviving claimants from that vessel.{{#tag:ref|The listing in the ''London Gazette'' mistakenly gives the name of ''Rosario{{'}}''s commander as &quot;Trollope&quot;, and ''Griffon{{'}}''s commander as &quot;Hervey&quot;.&lt;ref name=LG20939/&gt;|group=Note}}

William Henderson assumed command of ''Rosario''. [[s:A Naval Biographical Dictionary/Peake, Thomas Ladd|Thomas Ladd Peake]] replaced Henderson in June 1813.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-374794&quot;/&gt;

==Anti-smuggling duty==
Based in Portsmouth, ''Rosario'' spent the following years patrolling the coast. 

On 18 April 1816, ''Rosario'' was in company with the schooner [[Grecian (1812)|HMS ''Grecian'']] when they captured the smuggling vessel ''Nancy''.{{refn|Peake's first-class share of the proceeds for 100 kegs of spirits and headmoney for the smuggler's five-man crew was worth [[£sd|£]]47 8[[shilling|s]] 11[[pence|d]]; a fifth-class share, that of a seaman, was worth 14s.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17191|startpage=2149|endpage=2150|date=12 November 1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Then on 4 June ''Rosario'' captured ''Charlotte'', which had a three-man crew and was smuggling 85 kegs of spirits.{{refn|Peake's first-class share was worth £77 14s 6d; a fifth-class share was worth £1 1s 7d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17192|startpage=2175|date=16 November 1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Six weeks later, on 17 July, ''Rosario'' picked up 200 kegs of contraband spirits at sea.{{refn|Peake's share was worth £68 2s 6d; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth £1 1s 7d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17232|startpage=701|date=18 March 1817}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

On 12 January 1817, she seized ''Ino'', a smuggling boat loaded with 144 kegs of spirits.{{refn|A first-class share of the prize money was worth £43 6s; a sixth-class share was worth £1 6d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17279|date=23 August 1817|startpage=1812}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} In March 1818, she went to the aid of the merchantman ''Kingston''; her crew were later given a reward of £168.{{refn|Peake's first-class share was worth £46 12s 5¼d; a sixth-class share was worth 16s 11¼d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17436|date=2 January 1819|startpage=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

In 1819, ''Rosario'' came under the command of William Hendry.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-374794&quot;/&gt; She then returned to anti-smuggling duties. On 14 May 1819 she captured the sloop ''Providence'', and then five days later, the open boat ''Fly''. Lastly, on 25 June, she seized 98 gallons of spirits.{{refn|A first-class share of the proceeds of these captures was worth £9 19s; a sixth-class share was worth 3s 10½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17648|date=4 November 1820|startpage=2075}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} ''Rosario'' then transferred to the [[St. Helena]] station. 

Following the death of [[Napoleon]] in May 1821, [[Frederick Marryat]] was appointed to command her and carry the dispatches announcing Napoleon's death to England.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. K. Laughton]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18097 ‘Marryat, Frederick (1792–1848)’], rev. Andrew Lambert, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Between 20 September and 8 December Marrayat and ''Rosario'' made &quot;sundry captures&quot;.{{refn|The first-class share for these captures was worth £45 16s; a sixth-class share was worth 19s 7½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17820|date=25 May 1822|startpage=871}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

==Fate==

''Rosario'' was paid off in February 1822. The Admiralty advertised that they were putting her up for sale on 22 August 1832 at Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18692|startpage=1777|date=3 August 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sold to J. Levy of Rochester for £380 in November 1832.&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), pp. 314-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
