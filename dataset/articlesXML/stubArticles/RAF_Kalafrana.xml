'''RAF Kalafrana''' was a seaplane operations centre on the southernmost tip of Malta between 1917 and 1946, when it was transferred to the [[Royal Navy]]. It played an important role in both world wars, starting as a base for anti-submarine and anti-piracy operations, its role being expanded to include Air Sea Rescue (ASR) operations as aircraft usage and accident rates increased in the inter war years.

== Malta's operating bases ==

The [[Royal Naval Air Service]] base was formed early in 1917 when a slipway and seaplane shed were built, a dockyard construction unit moving in by June 1917 to assemble seaplane parts brought in from the UK.  By the end of July, five [[Curtiss Model H|Curtiss H-4]] small American flying boats were flown out of [[Felixstowe]], England, to begin patrolling the approaches to Malta. Later they were joined by [[Short Type 184]] seaplanes and two small [[FBA Type A]] two-seat flying boats. These were supported by [[Airco DH.9|de Havilland DH9]]s based at the grounds of the [[Royal Malta Golf Club]] at [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]], operating in the anti-submarine role.&lt;ref name=&quot;267squadron&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/267squadron.cfm |title=History of 267 Squadron |work=Royal Air Force |year=2014 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The DH9s formed the nucleus of Malta's first shore based air element, increasing the islands all-weather anti-submarine capability. By January 1923, a dedicated aerodrome was built at [[RAF Hal Far|Ħal Far]], providing a shore base for carrier based aircraft. These were supplemented by another grass and earth airfield at [[RAF Ta' Qali|Ta' Qali]] in 1940, both of which imposed severe operating restrictions in wet weather. In October 1939, work began on an aerodrome with a paved runway at [[RAF Luqa|Luqa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Meilaq |first=Charles |title=Squadron flies through adversity to the stars |work=[[The Times of Malta]] |date=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations and role ==

With the formation of the Royal Air Force on 1 April 1918, the RAF Kalafrana command was formalised under Colonel C. Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;Sea Your History. http://www.seayourhistory.org.uk/content/view/811/1046/1/0/, accessed on 04/11/2012.{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 267 Squadron RAF|267 Squadron]] was formed at Kalafrana on 27 September 1918 from 360, 361, 362 and 363 Flights as an anti-submarine unit flying patrols in the Mediterranean until the end of hostilities. 267 Squadron remained at Malta until being renumbered No. 481 Flight on 1 August 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;267squadron&quot;/&gt;

By December 1936, [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] moved to Kalafrana operating [[Hawker Osprey]]s, [[Fairey 111F]]s, [[Blackburn Shark]]s, [[Fairey Seal]]s and [[Fairey Swordfish]]. By September 1937, [[No. 209 Squadron RAF|209]] and [[No. 210 Squadron RAF|210 Squadrons]] were operating the [[Short Singapore]] on anti-piracy patrols for the benefit of British shipping during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. By 1940, these were supplemented by anti-submarine [[Short Sunderland]]s of [[No. 228 Squadron RAF|228 Squadron]] along with [[Supermarine Walrus]] flying boats and a float-equipped [[Fairey Swordfish]] in the ASR role. A detachment of Short Sunderland Mk.Is from 228 Squadron based at RAF Alexandria operated out of Kalafrana between 10 June and 25 March 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Evans |first=John |title=Help from the Heavens: A History of No. 228 Squadron RAF |location=Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, UK |publisher=Paterchurch Publications |year=1998 |isbn=1-870745-06-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAF Kalafrana also served as an ASR centre, operating a number of high speed launches of various types. A secondary base at Ta' Veccia in [[St. Paul's Bay]] gave the maritime section greater coverage and reduced reaction times.

The maintenance wing at RAF Kalafrana operated as the logistical recycling centre for RAF operations in Malta throughout the war. Engines, electronics, airframe parts and armaments from damaged aircraft were recovered, stored, repaired if necessary and reused where possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Lee |last=Heide |title=Whispering Death |page=106 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |year=2000 |isbn=1-55212-387-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling had become critical to the war effort in Malta as the island's isolation increased with the southward shift of Axis forces in late 1941.

== Kalafrana today ==
Between 1946 and 1979, the base was used by the Royal Navy as a general maintenance facility. The original site is buried under what is now the [[Malta Freeport]] terminal.
