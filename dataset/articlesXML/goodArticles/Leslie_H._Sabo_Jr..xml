'''Leslie Halasz Sabo Jr.''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: '''ifj. Halász Szabó László''') (22 February 1948&amp;nbsp;– 10 May 1970) was a [[soldier]] in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. He received the highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his actions during the [[Cambodian Campaign]] in 1970.

Born in [[Kufstein]], [[Austria]], Sabo's family immigrated to the [[United States]] when he was young and moved to [[Ellwood City, Pennsylvania]]. Sabo dropped out of college and was [[military draft|drafted]] into the U.S. Army in 1969, becoming a member of the [[506th Infantry Regiment]], [[101st Airborne Division]]. On 10 May 1970 Sabo's unit was on an [[interdiction]] mission near [[Se San]], [[Cambodia]] when they were ambushed from all sides by the [[Vietnam People's Army]]. Sabo repeatedly exposed himself to North Vietnamese fire, protecting other soldiers from a grenade blast and providing covering fire for American helicopters until he was killed. 

Sabo was nominated for the Medal of Honor shortly after his death, but the records were lost. In 1999 a fellow Vietnam War veteran came across the records and began the process of reopening Sabo's nomination. Following several delays, Sabo's widow received the Medal of Honor from President [[Barack Obama]] on 16 May 2012, 42 years after his death.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Sabo was born in [[Kufstein]], [[Austria]] on 22 February 1948 to Elizabeth and Leslie Sabo Sr., who had been members of an upper-class [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCT&quot;/&gt; Leslie Jr. had one brother, George, who was born in 1944, as well as a second brother who had been killed in World War II bombings at the age of one.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoldiersMagazine&quot;/&gt; With the post-[[World War II]] occupation of Hungary by the [[Soviet Union]], Sabo's family lost their fortune in the war and, upon realizing [[Communism]] would be installed in Hungary long-term, they left the country permanently.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoldiersMagazine&quot;/&gt;

The Sabo family moved to the [[United States]] in 1950 just after Sabo turned two years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCT&quot;/&gt; Leslie Sr., who had previously worked as a lawyer, attended evening classes to become an [[engineer]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoldiersMagazine&quot;/&gt; The family moved to [[Youngstown, Ohio]] and lived there for a short time before moving to [[Ellwood City, Pennsylvania]], as Leslie Sr. followed a job at [[Blaw-Knox Corp.]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PPG2010&quot;/&gt; Growing up, Sabo's father stressed discipline and patriotism.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoldiersMagazine&quot;/&gt; Sabo graduated from [[Lincoln High School (Ellwood City, Pennsylvania)|Lincoln High School]] in 1966&lt;ref name=&quot;BCT&quot;/&gt; and briefly attended [[Youngstown State University]] before dropping out and working at a [[steel mill]] for a short time.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;S&quot;/&gt; He was described by friends and family as an affectionate and &quot;kind-hearted hometown boy&quot; who was easygoing and always in good humor.&lt;ref name=&quot;PPG2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/10129/1056818-54.stm |title=Vietnam War hero may finally get his due |date= 9 May 2010 |last=Ove |first=Torsten |publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed [[billiards]] and [[bowling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SoldiersMagazine&quot;/&gt;

=== Military career ===
[[File:Leslie H. Sabo in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|Sabo in 1969 holding an [[M60 machine gun|M-60]] Machine Gun.]]
Sabo was [[military draft|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]] April 1969 and sent to [[Fort Benning, Georgia]] for [[basic combat training]]. While on leave he married Rose Sabo-Brown (née Buccelli), the daughter of a World War II veteran and [[Silver Star Medal]] recipient, whom he had met in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;S&quot;/&gt; He attended [[advanced individual training]] in September and October of that year, followed by a [[honeymoon]] trip to [[New York City, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SoldiersMagazine&quot;/&gt; Sabo was assigned to Bravo Company of the 3rd Battalion, [[506th Infantry Regiment]], [[U.S. 101st Airborne Division]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BCT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PPG2010&quot;/&gt; and was known to enjoy his time in the military, preferring the environment of discipline and camaraderie.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoldiersMagazine&quot;/&gt;

In January 1970 Sabo and his unit departed for [[Vietnam]] to fight in the [[Vietnam War]] and he began corresponding with his wife regularly via letter.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoldiersMagazine&quot;/&gt; The unit came into contact with North Vietnamese troops frequently for the first several months of its deployment, but most of these were small [[hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIlvaine&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=McIlvaine |first=Rob |url=http://www.army.mil/article/80098/Boys_of_Bravo_Company_become__Bravo_Family____finally/ |title=Boys of Bravo Company become 'Bravo Family' - finally |publisher=[[United States Army]] |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May 1970 Sabo's platoon was attached to the [[U.S. 4th Infantry Division]] for a secret mission into [[Cambodia]] and dropped into the country on a [[UH-1 Huey]] helicopter. They were to conduct a series of [[interdiction]] missions against the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] with the assistance of heavy [[air support]]. For five days they came into constant, heavy contact with North Vietnamese forces that were often of superior size.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIlvaine&quot;/&gt;

===Medal of Honor action===
{{see also|Cambodian Campaign}}
On 10 May 1970 Sabo's platoon was part of a force of two platoons from Bravo Company on a mission to [[Se San]], Cambodia. They were to engage a force of [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) troops that had used the area as a staging ground for the [[Tet Offensive]] and other attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCT&quot;/&gt; There they were ambushed by a force of 150 NVA troops hidden in the jungle and the trees, which had caught the American force in the open and unprepared.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCT&quot;/&gt; This battle became known as the &quot;[[Mother's Day]] ambush.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PGOve&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-north/posthumous-medal-of-honor-awarded-to-ellwood-city-soldier-631764/ |title=Posthumous Medal of Honor awarded to Ellwood City soldier |last=Ove |first=Torsten |publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' |date=17 April 2012 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabo, who was at the column's end, repeatedly repulsed efforts by the North Vietnamese to surround and overrun the Americans. As the battle continued, a North Vietnamese soldier threw a grenade near a wounded American soldier lying in the open. Sabo ran out from a small tree that had been providing him cover and draped himself over his wounded comrade as the grenade exploded. Then, after absorbing multiple wounds from the grenade blast, Sabo attacked the enemy trench, killing two soldiers with a grenade of his own, and helped his injured ally to the shelter of a nearby treeline. Later, with the Americans running out of ammunition, Sabo again exposed himself to retrieve rounds from Americans killed earlier in the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hames&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Hames |first=Jacqueline M. |url=http://www.army.mil/article/79892 |title=Gallantry to be honored after 42 years |publisher=''Soldier's Magazine'' |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |date= |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sabo then began redistributing ammunition to other members of the platoon,&lt;ref name=&quot;PGOve&quot;/&gt; including stripping ammunition from wounded and dead comrades. As night fell the North Vietnamese refocused their efforts from wiping out the American force to harassing the helicopters that were carrying more than two dozen wounded soldiers. As that was occurring, the remaining platoon from Bravo Company broke through the North Vietnamese lines and relieved the other two platoons while the first medical helicopter arrived and loaded two wounded soldiers under heavy fire. Sabo again stepped out into the open and provided covering fire for the helicopter until his ammunition was exhausted. He received several serious wounds under heavy fire by the North Vietnamese while trying to reload.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCT&quot;/&gt; Although mortally wounded, Sabo crawled forward toward the enemy emplacement, pulled the pin of a grenade, and threw it at the last possible second toward an enemy bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy bunker at the cost of Sabo's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Eloise |first=Lee |url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-05-10/news/31653093_1_platoon-members-enemy-grenade |title=This Soldier Was Hit By 2 Grenades And Just Never Gave Up The Fight To Shield His Buddies |publisher=''[[Business Insider]]'' |location=[[New York City, New York]] |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Smith |first=Mark S. |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/16/leslie-h-sabo-jr-medal-of-honor_n_1520895.html |title=Leslie H.

===Subsequent recognition===

Although he was [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]] promoted to the rank of [[sergeant]], the circumstances of Sabo's death remained unclear to his family for several decades thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.com/news/local_news/local-man-awarded-medal-of-honor/article_3d3ff9e9-0631-577d-b346-8a46ddc418a4.html |title=Local man awarded Medal of Honor |first=Eric |last=Poole |publisher=''Beaver County Times'' |date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially the military reported Sabo had been killed by a [[sniper]] while guarding an ammunition cache somewhere in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoldiersMagazine&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Collins |first=Elizabeth M. |url=http://www.army.mil/article/79843/ |title=Remembering a hero: Medal of Honor recipient Spc. 4 Leslie H. Sabo Jr. |publisher=''Soldiers Magazine'' |date=15 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the action Sabo's [[company commander]], [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] Jim Waybright, recommended him for the Medal of Honor, but the accounts of Sabo's actions and citation were lost for several decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCT&quot;/&gt; This changed in 1999 when Alton Mabb, another Vietnam War veteran of the 101st Airborne Division and a columnist for the division association magazine, uncovered the documents while at the [[National Archives]] in [[College Park, Maryland]]. Mabb publicized Sabo's exploits in the magazine and also wrote [[United States Congress|U.S. Congresswoman]] [[Corrine Brown]] D.-FL, whom he asked to forward the recommendation. Brown lobbied the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] for Sabo to be recognized and, in 2006, [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Francis J. Harvey]] recommended that Sabo receive the Medal of Honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;PGOve&quot;/&gt; Due to the delay in processing the citation, however, the award had to be approved by an act of Congress, so Brown attached it as a [[rider (legislation)|rider]] to a 2008 defense authorization bill. After continued delays in the process, however, Sabo's family contacted U.S. Congressman [[Jason Altmire]] D.-PA to push the award through the Defense Department. Secretary of the Army [[John M. McHugh|John McHugh]] recommended the Medal of Honor for Sabo in March 2010 and, on 16 April 2012, it was announced that Sabo's family would receive the medal from U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] at a [[White House]] ceremony, 42 years after the action.&lt;ref name=&quot;PGOve&quot;/&gt; Sabo posthumously received the Medal of Honor at the White House 16 May 2012, which was accepted by his widow.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoldiersMagazine&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;S&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/army/vietnam-veteran-to-be-awarded-medal-of-honor-posthumously-1.174664 |last=Burke |first=Matthew |title=Vietnam veteran to be awarded Medal of Honor posthumously |publisher=''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' |date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/16/president-obama-award-medal-honor |title=President Obama to award Medal of Honor |date=16 April 2012 |publisher=[[White House]] press office |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabo is interred at Holy Redeemer Cemetery in [[North Sewickley Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania|North Sewickley Township, Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name=&quot;PPG2010&quot;/&gt; and is honored at a memorial to B Company in [[Marietta, Ohio]], the home of his former commanding officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hames&quot;/&gt; ''Company of Heroes'', a book written by Ellwood City-based journalist Eric Poole about Sabo and his fellow soldiers in Bravo Company, was released in 2015 by [[Osprey Publishing]].

{{Quotation|For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty: Specialist Four Leslie H. Sabo Jr. distinguished himself by conspicuous acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty at the cost of his own life while serving as a rifleman in Company B, 3d Battalion, 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division in Se San, Cambodia, on May 10, 1970. On that day, Specialist Four Sabo and his platoon were conducting a reconnaissance patrol when they were ambushed from all sides by a large enemy force. Without hesitation, Specialist Four Sabo charged an enemy position, killing several enemy soldiers. Immediately thereafter, he assaulted an enemy flanking force, successfully drawing their fire away from friendly soldiers and ultimately forcing the enemy to retreat. In order to re-supply ammunition, he sprinted across an open field to a wounded comrade. As he began to reload, an enemy grenade landed nearby. Specialist Four Sabo picked it up, threw it, and shielded his comrade with his own body, thus absorbing the brunt of the blast and saving his comrade's life. Seriously wounded by the blast, Specialist Four Sabo nonetheless retained the initiative and then single-handedly charged an enemy bunker that had inflicted severe damage on the platoon, receiving several serious wounds from automatic weapons fire in the process. Now mortally injured, he crawled towards the enemy emplacement and, when in position, threw a grenade into the bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy fire, but also ended Specialist Four Sabo's life. His indomitable courage and complete disregard for his own safety saved the lives of many of his platoon members. Specialist Four Sabo's extraordinary heroism and selflessness, above and beyond the call of duty, at the cost of his life, are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, Company B, 3d Battalion, 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, and the United States Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.army.mil/article/79802/ |title=Medal of Honor Citation: Specialist Four Leslie H.
