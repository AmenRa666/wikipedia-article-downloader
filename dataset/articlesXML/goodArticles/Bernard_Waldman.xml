'''Bernard Waldman''' (October 12, 1913 – November 1, 1986) was an American physicist who flew on the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima atomic bombing mission]] as a cameraman during [[World War II]].

A graduate of [[New York University]], joined the faculty of the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1938. During [[World War II]], he served in the [[United States Navy]] as an engineering officer. He headed a group that conducted blast measurements for the [[Trinity nuclear test]], and served on [[Tinian]] with [[Project Alberta]].

After the war he returned to Notre Dame. He was director of the [[Midwestern Universities Research Association]] Laboratory from 1960 to 1964, dean of its [[Notre Dame College of Science]] at Notre Dame from 1967 to 1979, and associate director of the [[National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory]] from 1979 to 1983.

==Early life and education==
Bernard Waldman was born in [[New York City]] on October 12, 1913. He attended [[New York University]], from which he received Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;/&gt; His thesis, on &quot;The Resonance Processes in the Disintegration of Boron by Protons&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.nd.edu/chemistry/resources/genealogy/physics/documents/WaldmanB.pdf |title=Bernard Waldman - PhD |publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; formed the basis of a paper published in the ''[[Physical Review]]''. His research supported the estimates of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Robert Serber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Resonance Processes in the Disintegration of Boron by Protons |last=Waldman |first=B. |last2=Waddel |first2=R. C. |last3=Callihan |first3=D. |last4=Schneider |first4=W. A.|journal = [[Physical Review]] |volume = 54 |issue = 12 |pages = 1017–1020 |date=December 1938  |publisher = American Physical Society |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.54.1017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was a [[Congregationalist]], Waldman joined the faculty of the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1938. He became an [[assistant professor]] in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;/&gt;

== Manhattan Project ==
During [[World War II]], Waldman served in the [[United States Navy]] as an engineering officer, and was involved in construction and extension of naval bases in the United States.{{sfn|Jones|Mills|Sessler|Symon|2010|p=102}} He took a leave of absence from Notre Dame and joined Oppenheimer and Serber at the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;/&gt; He was assigned to [[Norman F. Ramsey]]'s E-7 Group, which was part of the Ordnance (O) Division responsible for &quot;integration of design and delivery&quot;. Most of the work involved preparing and checking instrumentation from drop tests involving dummy bombs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinity&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/General_info/ND_Manhattan_project.pdf |title=Early Days of Nuclear Physics at Notre Dame and the Manhattan Project |first=Philipp |last=Wiescher |publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agnew on Tinian.jpg|thumb|left|Waldman (bottom right) on Tinian with [[Harold Agnew]] (top left), [[Luis W. Alvarez]] (top right) and [[Lawrence H. Johnston]] (bottom left)]]
Waldman was the head of Group TR-6 (Airborne Measurements) for the [[Trinity nuclear test]] in July 1945. He developed microphones that were dropped by parachute to measure the effect of the blast. He was then assigned to [[Project Alberta]], the part of the Manhattan Project that oversaw the preparation of facilities to test and deploy nuclear weapons, and support their use during the actual missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinity&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ACAP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physicsnow.org/history/acap/institutions/manhattan.jsp |title=The Manhattan Project |publisher=Array of Contemporary American Physicists |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he participated in the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], as a camera operator on the [[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|observation aircraft]]. He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie camera with six seconds of film in order to record the blast. Unfortunately, Waldman forgot to open the camera shutter, and no film was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20030824&amp;slug=marquardtobit24 |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]  |title=George Marquardt, U.S. war pilot over Hiroshima, dies at 84 |first=Dennis |last=McLellan |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Alvarez|Trower|1987|p=66}}

==Later life==
After the war ended, Waldman returned to Notre Dame, where he continued his research into the [[photodisintegration]] of [[deuterium]] and [[beryllium]].{{sfn|Jones|Mills|Sessler|Symon|2010|p=102}} For a time he was in charge of a 3-million volt [[particle accelerator]] that was the world`s second most powerful source of [[X-rays]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;/&gt; In 1960, Waldman  took a sabbatical from Notre Dame to become director of the [[Midwestern Universities Research Association]] (MURP) Laboratory. He set about fixing problems with the 50 MeV accelerator. These were resolved, but the Federal Government declined to fund MURP's activities, and Walden returned to Notre Dame in 1964.{{sfn|Jones|Mills|Sessler|Symon|2010|p=102}} Waldman was appointed dean of Notre Dame's College of Science in 1967. He held this position  August, 1979, when he retired at the age of 65. He then became as associate director of the [[National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory]] at [[Michigan State University]], a position he held until 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;/&gt;

Waldman died in a hospital in [[Sanford, North Carolina]], where he was being treated for cancer, on November 1, 1986. He was survived by his wife, Glenna and three daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-11-16/news/8603260170_1_hiroshima-atomic-bomb-mr-waldman |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |title=Bomb Physicist Bernard Waldman |date=November 16, 1986 |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A funeral service was held at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] on the campus of the University of  Notre Dame, and he was interred in its Cedar Grove Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Star-News&quot;&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Star-News]] |date=Nov 13, 1986 |title=Atomic Bomb Scientist Bernard Waldman dies |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19861113&amp;id=P3ZSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4RMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4495,5334268 |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His papers are in the University of Notre Dame Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.nd.edu/findaids/ead/xml/wal.xml |title=Bernard Waldman Papers |publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
