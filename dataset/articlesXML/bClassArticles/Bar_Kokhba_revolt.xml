The '''Bar Kokhba revolt''' ({{lang-he-n|מרד בר כוכבא|links=no}}; ''Mered Bar Kokhba'') was a rebellion of the Jews of the [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judea]], led by [[Simon bar Kokhba]], against the [[Roman Empire]]. Fought circa 132–136 CE,&lt;ref&gt;for the year 136, see: W. Eck, ''The Bar Kokhba Revolt: The Roman Point of View'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; it was the last of three major [[Jewish–Roman wars]], so it is also known as '''The Third Jewish–Roman War''' or '''The Third Jewish Revolt'''. Some historians also refer to it as the '''Second Revolt of Judea''', not counting the [[Kitos War]] (115–117 CE), which had only marginally been fought in Judea.

The revolt erupted as a result of ongoing religious and political tensions in Judea following on the failure of the First Revolt in 66−70 CE. These tensions were related to the establishment of a large Roman presence in Judea, changes in administrative life and the economy, together with the outbreak and suppression of Jewish revolts from Mesopotamia to Libya and Cyrenaica.&lt;ref&gt;William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein,[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjtWLZhhMoYC&amp;pg=PA106  ''The Cambridge History of Judaism: The late Roman-Rabbinic period,''] Cambridge University Press, 1984 pp.106.&lt;/ref&gt; The proximate reasons seem to centre around the proscription of [[Religious male circumcision#In Judaism|circumcision]], the construction of a new city, [[Aelia Capitolina]], over the ruins of Jerusalem, and the erection of a temple to Jupiter on the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eshel&quot; /&gt; The Church Fathers and rabbinic literature emphasize [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Judaea (Roman Province)|Judaea]] [[Quintus Tineius Rufus (consul 127)|Rufus]]' role in provoking the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein: The Cambridge History of Judaism: The late Roman-Rabbinic period, p. 35., Cambridge University Press, 1984, ISBN 9780521772488&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 132, a revolt led by Bar Kokhba quickly spread from [[Modi'in]] across the country, cutting off the Roman garrison in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Axelrod |first=Alan |title=Little-Known Wars of Great and Lasting Impact |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8x322-89x3MC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=In+132,+a+revolt+led+by+Bar+Kokhba+quickly+spread+from+Modi%27in&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pNKWU-WFBPSssASm2YDADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20132%2C%20a%20revolt%20led%20by%20Bar%20Kokhba%20quickly%20spread%20from%20Modi'in&amp;f=false |publisher=Fair Winds Press |year=2009 |page=29 |isbn=9781592333752}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quintus Tineius Rufus (consul 127)|Roman Governor Rufus]] then unsuccessfully engaged the early phase of the uprising. Rufus is last recorded in 132, the first year of the rebellion; whether he died or was replaced is uncertain. Initial rebel victories over the Romans established an independent state of Israel over parts of Judea for over two years, as Bar Kokhba took the title of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]] (&quot;prince&quot;). Simon bar Kokhba, the commander of the revolt, was regarded by many Jews as the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]], who would restore their national independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John S.

The Roman army was made of six full [[Roman legion|legions]] with [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] and elements from up to six additional legions, which finally managed to crush the revolt.&lt;ref name=Israel-Tour-Day&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616233531/http://www.rsy-netzer.org.uk/newsletters/mailing-view/65.html|archivedate=6 June 2011|title=Israel Tour Daily Newsletter|url=http://www.rsy-netzer.org.uk/newsletters/mailing-view/65.html|date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bar Kokhba revolt had greatly influenced the course of the Jewish history and the philosophy of the Jewish religion. Despite easing the persecution of Jews following Hadrian's death in 138 CE, the Romans barred Jews from [[Jerusalem]], except for attendance in [[Tisha B'Av]]. [[Jewish messianism]] was abstracted and spiritualized, and rabbinical political thought became deeply cautious and conservative. The Talmud, for instance, refers to Bar Kokhba as &quot;Ben-Kusiba,&quot; a derogatory term used to indicate that he was a false Messiah. It was also among the key events to [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|differentiate]] Christianity as a religion distinct from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;M.

==Background==
{{Main article|Jewish–Roman wars|Judea (Roman province)}}

After the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] in 70 CE, the Roman authorities took measures to suppress the rebellious province of [[Roman Judea|Judea]]. Instead of a [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]], they installed a [[praetor]] as a [[Roman governor|governor]] and stationed an entire [[Roman legion|legion]], the [[Legio X Fretensis|X ''Fretensis'']], in the area. Tensions continued to build up in the wake of the [[Kitos War]], the second large-scale Jewish insurrection in the Eastern Mediterranean, the final stages of which saw fighting in Judea.

Historians have suggested multiple reasons for the sparking of the Bar Kokhba revolt, long-term and proximate. The revolt is shrouded in mystery, and only one brief historical account of the rebellion survives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eshel&quot; &gt;Hanan Eshel,[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjtWLZhhMoYC&amp;pg=PA105 'The Bar Kochba revolt, 132-135,'] in William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein, Steven T. Katz (eds.) ''The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 4, The Late Roman-Rabbinic Period,'' pp.105-127, p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; Several elements are believed to have contributed to the rebellion; changes in administrative law, the diffuse presence of Romans, alterations in agricultural practice with a shift from landowning to sharecropping, the impact of a possible period of economic decline, and an upsurge of nationalism, the latter influenced by similar revolts among the Jewish communities in Egypt, Cyrenaica, Libya and Mesopotamia during the reign of Trajan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eshel&quot; /&gt; The proximate reasons seem to centre around the proscription of [[Religious male circumcision#In Judaism|circumcision]], the construction of a new city, [[Aelia Capitolina]], over the ruins of Jerusalem, and the erection of a temple to Jupiter on the Temple mount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eshel&quot; /&gt; One interpretation involves the visit in 130 CE of the Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]] to the ruins of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. At first sympathetic towards the Jews, Hadrian promised to rebuild the Temple, but the Jews felt betrayed when they found out that he intended to build a temple dedicated to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] upon the ruins of the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref name=Dio /&gt; A rabbinic version of this story claims that Hadrian planned on rebuilding the Temple, but that a malevolent [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] convinced him not to. The reference to a malevolent Samaritan is, however, a familiar device of Jewish literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World: The Jews of Palestine from Alexander the Great to the Arab Conquest | first = Peter | last = Schäfer | authorlink = Peter Schäfer | publisher = Routledge | date = 2003 | page = 146 | others = Translated by David Chowcat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional legion, the [[Legio VI Ferrata|VI ''Ferrata'']], arrived in the province to maintain order. Works on [[Aelia Capitolina]], as Jerusalem was to be called, commenced in 131 CE. The governor of Judea, [[Quintus Tineius Rufus (consul 127)|Tineius Rufus]], performed the foundation ceremony, which involved ploughing over the designated city limits.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite encyclopedia | title = [[A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome]] | chapter = Pomerium | chapter-url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Pomerium.html | first = Samuel Ball | last = Platner | authorlink = Samuel Ball Platner | date = 1929 | via = LacusCurtius}} {{Cite book | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn = 9781136823282 | last = Gates | first = Charles | title = Ancient Cities: The Archaeology of Urban Life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome | date = 2011 | page = 335 | via = Google books}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Ploughing up the Temple&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Mishnah]] has a segment: &quot;[O]n the 9th of Ab...and the city was ploughed up.&quot; on mas.

==Timeline of events==

===Eruption of the revolt===

Jewish leaders carefully planned the second revolt to avoid the numerous mistakes that had plagued the first [[Great Jewish Revolt]] sixty years earlier.{{cn|date=August 2016}} In 132, a revolt led by Bar Kokhba quickly spread from [[Modi'in]] across the country, cutting off the Roman garrison in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Axelrod |first=Alan |title=Little-Known Wars of Great and Lasting Impact |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8x322-89x3MC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=In+132,+a+revolt+led+by+Bar+Kokhba+quickly+spread+from+Modi%27in&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pNKWU-WFBPSssASm2YDADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20132%2C%20a%20revolt%20led%20by%20Bar%20Kokhba%20quickly%20spread%20from%20Modi'in&amp;f=false |publisher=Fair Winds Press |year=2009 |page=29 |isbn=9781592333752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eusebius]] of Caesarea wrote that Jewish Christians were killed and suffered &quot;all kinds of persecutions&quot; at the hands of rebel Jews when they refused to help Bar Kokhba against the Roman troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ja-jn/jewish_wars/bk03.html#Justin.|title=Texts on Bar Kochba: Eusebius|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See: Bourgel, Jonathan, ″The Jewish-Christians in the storm of the Bar Kokhba Revolt″, in: ''From One Identity to Another: The Mother Church of Jerusalem Between the Two Jewish Revolts Against Rome (66-135/6 EC)''. Paris: Éditions du Cerf, collection Judaïsme ancien et Christianisme primitive, (French), pp. 127-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish sage [[Rabbi Akiva]] indulged the possibility that Simon Bar Kosiba could be the [[Jewish messiah]], and gave him the surname &quot;Bar Kokhba&quot; meaning &quot;Son of a Star&quot; in the [[Aramaic language]], from the [[Star Prophecy]] verse from [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb|Numbers|24:17}}: &quot;There shall come a star out of [[Jacob]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Numbers|24:17}}: There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of [[Moab]], and destroy all the children of [[Sheth]].&lt;/ref&gt; The name [[Bar Kokhba (disambiguation)|Bar Kokhba]] does not appear in the [[Talmud]] but in ecclesiastical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |chapter = BAR KOKBA AND BAR KOKBA WAR | chapterurl = http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2464-bar-cochba-bar-cochbah | encyclopedia = [[The Jewish Encyclopedia]] | date = 1906 | editor-last = Singer | editor-first = Isidore | first=S. |last=Krauss |volume=2 |pages = 506–507 | quote = Bar Kokba, the hero of the third war against Rome, appears under this name only among ecclesiastical writers: heathen authors do not mention him; and Jewish sources call him Ben (or Bar) Koziba or Kozba...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rufus' campaign and guerrilla warfare===
The [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Judaea (Roman Province)|Judaea]] [[Quintus Tineius Rufus (consul 127)|Rufus]] unsuccessfully engaged the early phase of the Judean uprising under [[Simon bar Kokhba]] and [[Eleazar of Modi'im|Elasar]]. The Church Fathers and rabbinic literature emphasize his role in provoking the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein: The Cambridge History of Judaism: The late Roman-Rabbinic period, p. 35., Cambridge University Press, 1984, ISBN 9780521772488&lt;/ref&gt; He is last recorded in 132, the first year of the rebellion; whether he died or was replaced is uncertain. His replacement is however attributed to the failure of initial Roman campaign to suppress the rebellion.

Simon Bar Kokhba took the title ''[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi Israel]]'' and ruled over an entity that was virtually independent for two and a half years. The era of the [[Salvation#Judaism|redemption of Israel]] was announced, contracts were signed and a large quantity of [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage|Bar Kokhba Revolt coinage]] was struck over foreign coins.

The outbreak and initial success of the rebellion took the Romans by surprise. The rebels incorporated combined tactics to fight the Roman Army. According to some historians, Bar Kokhba's army practiced guerrilla warfare, inflicting heavy casualties. Others, however, claim that Bar Kokhba actually preferred direct engagement due to his superiority in numbers, and only after several painful defeats in the fields did the Romans decide to avoid open conflict and methodically besiege individual cities. With the slowly advancing Roman army cutting supply lines, the rebels engaged in long-term defense. The defense system of Judean towns and villages was based mainly on hideout caves, which were created in large numbers in almost every population center. Many houses utilized underground hideouts, where Judean rebels hoped to withstand Roman superiority by the narrowness of the passages and even ambushes from underground. The cave systems were often interconnected and used not only as hideouts for the rebels but also for storage and refuge for their families.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1TA-Fg4wBnUC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=bar+kokhba+hideout+systems&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GlaA7CVIKX&amp;sig=R13hJeDivoHpHlk1b-reENSmo4o&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D8hfVIPzIMPgavnigqAP&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bar%20kokhba%20hideout%20systems&amp;f=false Peter Schäfer. ''The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered''. 2003. p184]&lt;/ref&gt; Hideout systems were employed in the Judean hills, the Judean desert, northern Negev, and to some degree also in Galilee, Samaria and Jordan Valley. As of July 2015 some 350 hideout systems have been mapped within the ruins of 140 Jewish villages.&lt;ref name=nrg/&gt;

===Julius Severus' campaign===
[[File:Bar Kokhba's papyrus.png|thumb|200px|left|A cluster of [[papyrus]] containing Bar Kokhba's orders during the last phase of the revolt, found at the [[Cave of Letters]] in the Judean desert by Israeli archaeologist [[Yigael Yadin]].]]
Following a series of setbacks, Hadrian called his general [[Sextus Julius Severus]] from [[Roman Britain|Britain]], and troops were brought from as far as the [[Danube]]. The size of the Roman army amassed against the rebels was much larger than that commanded by [[Titus]] sixty years earlier - nearly one third of the Roman army took part in the campaign against Bar Kokhba. It is estimated that forces from 12 Legions participated in Severus' final campaign, including [[Legio X Fretensis]], [[Legio VI Ferrata]], [[Legio III Gallica]], [[Legio III Cyrenaica]], [[Legio XXII Deiotariana]], [[Legio X Gemina]], [[Legio V Macedonica]], [[Legio XI Claudia]], [[Legio II Traiana Fortis]] and [[Legio XII Fulminata]], with a total force of 60,000–120,000 Roman soldiers facing Bar-Kokhba's rebels. While it is generally accepted that [[Legio XXII Deiotariana]] was destroyed during the revolt, it is not clear whether the legion's fall occurred in the initial stages of the revolt or during the decisive campaign of [[Sextus Julius Severus]]. A similar case may be assumed about [[Legio IX Hispana]], whose disappearance during the second century is often attributed to this war.&lt;ref name=&quot;livius.org&quot;/&gt;
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20047 Archeological sites of Israel.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Remains of [[Hurvat Itri]], destroyed during the Bar Kokhba revolt]]

====Battle of Tel Shalem====
According to some views, one of the crucial battles of the war took place near Tel Shalem in the [[Beit She'an]] valley, near what is now identified as the legionary camp of Legio VI Ferrata. Next to the camp, archaeologists have unearthed the remnants of a triumphal arch, which featured a dedication to Emperor Hadrian, which most likely refers to the defeat of Bar Kokhba's army.&lt;ref&gt;Mohr Siebek et al. Edited by Peter Schäfer. ''The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered''. 2003. P172.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional finds at Tel Shalem, including a bust of Emperor Hadrian, specifically link the site to the period. The theory for a major battle in Tel Shalem implies a significant extension of the area of the rebellion - while some historians confine the conflict to Judea proper, the location of Tel Shalem suggests that the war encompassed the northern Jordan Valley as well, some 50&amp;nbsp;km north to the boundaries of the war per minimalistic approach.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

====Siege of Betar====
{{main article|Betar (fortress)}}
After losing many of their strongholds, Bar Kokhba and the remnants of his army withdrew to the fortress of [[Betar (fortress)|Betar]], which subsequently came under siege in the summer of 135. [[Legio V Macedonica]] and [[Legio XI Claudia]] are said to have taken part in the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine during the Years 1873-1874'', London 1899, pp. 463-470&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jewish tradition, the fortress was breached and destroyed on the fast of [[Tisha B'av]], the ninth day of the lunar month Av, a day of mourning for the destruction of the First and the Second Jewish Temple. Rabbinical literature ascribes the defeat to Bar Kokhba killing his maternal uncle, Rabbi [[Eleazar of Modi'im|Elazar Hamudaʻi]], after suspecting him of collaborating with the enemy, thereby forfeiting Divine protection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] [[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] iv. 68d; [[Lamentations Rabbah]] ii. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The horrendous scene after the city's capture could be best described as a massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Talmud, ''Taanit'' 4:5 (24a); Midrash Rabba (Lamentations Rabba 2:5).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] relates that the number of dead in Betar was enormous, that the Romans &quot;went on killing until their horses were submerged in blood to their nostrils.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] 4:5&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Roman Inscription found near Bettir in 19th century.jpg|thumb|right|Roman Inscription found near Battir mentioning the 5th and 11th Roman Legions]]

===Annihilation===
According to a Rabbinic [[midrash]], in addition to Bar Kokhba himself, the Romans executed eight leading members of the [[Sanhedrin]] (The list of [[Ten Martyrs]] include two earlier Rabbis): [[Rabbi Akiva|R. Akiva]]; R. [[Hanania ben Teradion]]; the interpreter of the Sanhedrin, R. Huspith; R. [[Eliezer ben Shamua]]; R. [[Hanina ben Hakinai]]; R. [[Jeshbab the Scribe]]; R. Yehuda ben Dama; and R. [[Yehuda ben Baba]]. The Rabbinic account describes agonizing tortures: R. Akiva was flayed with iron combs, R. Ishmael had the skin of his head pulled off slowly, and R. Hanania was burned at a stake, with wet wool held by a Torah scroll wrapped around his body to prolong his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=228&amp;letter=M Martyrs, The Ten] ''Jewish Encyclopedia'': &quot;The fourth martyr was Hananiah ben Teradion, who was wrapped in a scroll of the Law and placed on a pyre of green brushwood; to prolong his agony, wet wool was placed on his chest.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Fall of Betar, the Roman legions went on a rampage of systematic killing, eliminating all remaining Jewish villages in the region and seeking out the refugees. The historians argue for the exact period of Roman campaign, following the defeat in Betar. While some claim the resistance was broken shortly, others argue that pockets of Jewish rebels continued to hide with their families into the winter months of late 135 and possibly even spring 136. By early 136 however, it is clear that the revolt was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Mohr Siebek et al. Edited by Peter Schäfer. ''The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered''. 2003. P160. &quot;Thus it is very likely that the revolt ended only in early 136.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
According to Cassius Dio, 580,000 Jews were killed in the overall operations, and 50 fortified towns and 985 villages were razed to the ground,&lt;ref name=Dio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zuckermann.org/mosaic.html &quot;Mosaic or mosaic?—The Genesis of the Israeli Language&quot;] by Zuckermann, Gilad&lt;/ref&gt; with many more Jews dying of famine and disease. Schäfer, however, suggested that Dio likely exaggerated his numbers.&lt;ref name=schafer-1981&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schäfer|first1=P.|title=Der Bar Kochba-Aufstand|date=1981|location=Tübingen|pages=131ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Cotton considered Dio's figures highly plausible, in light of accurate Roman census declarations.&lt;ref&gt;Mohr Siebek et al. Edited by Peter Schäfer. ''The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered''. 2003. P142-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many Judean war captives were sold into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Mor, M. ''The Second Jewish Revolt: The Bar Kokhba War, 132-136 CE''. Brill, 2016. P471/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Cassius Dio also claimed that &quot;Many Romans, moreover, perished in this war. Therefore, Hadrian, in writing to the Senate, did not employ the opening phrase commonly affected by the emperors: 'If you and your children are in health, it is well; I and the army are in health.'&quot;&lt;ref name=Cassius&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legio XXII Deiotariana|XXII ''Deiotariana'']] was disbanded after serious losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;F. Keppie 2000 pp 228-229&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;livius.org account&quot;/&gt; In addition, some historians argue that [[Legio IX Hispana]] disbandment in the mid-2nd century could also have been a result of this war.&lt;ref name=&quot;livius.org&quot;/&gt; While previously it had generally been accepted that the Ninth disappearance was after 108 CE (thus possibly suffering a demise in Britain according to Mommsen), with the 2015 Nijmegen archaeological findings dated to 121 CE and the known inscriptions of two senior officers, who were deputy commanders of the Ninth in 120 CE, and lived on for several decades to lead distinguished public careers, it was concluded that the Legion was disbanded between 120 and 197 CE - either as a result of the Bar-Kokhba revolt (132-6) or Cappadocia (161) or at the Danube (162).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/legion/legio-viiii-hispana/|title=Legio VIIII Hispana|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Immediate consequences===

Hadrian's proclamations sought to root out the nationalistic features within Judea's Jewish communities,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eshel&quot;/&gt; which he saw as the cause of continuous rebellions. He prohibited the [[Torah]] law and the [[Hebrew calendar]], and executed Judaic scholars. The sacred scroll was ceremonially burned on the [[Temple Mount]]. At the former Temple sanctuary, he installed two statues, one of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], another of himself. In an attempt to erase any memory of [[Judea]] or [[Ancient Israel]], he wiped the name off the map and replaced it with [[Syria Palaestina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H.H. Ben-Sasson, 1976, page 334&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ariel Lewin p. 33&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bar Kokhba War Reconsidered&quot;/&gt; By destroying the association of Jews to Judea and forbidding the practice of Jewish faith, Hadrian aimed to root out a nation that inflicted heavy casualties on the Roman Empire. Similarly, he re-established Jerusalem, but now as the Roman pagan [[polis]] of Aelia Capitolina, and Jews were forbidden from entering it, except on the day of [[Tisha B'Av]].&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', page 334: &quot;Jews were forbidden to live in the city and were allowed to visit it only once a year, on the Ninth of Ab, to mourn on the ruins of their holy Temple.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A miniature from the 15th-century manuscript &quot;Histoire des Empereurs&quot;.]]
Modern historians view the Bar-Kokhba Revolt as being of decisive historic importance.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; They note that, unlike the aftermath of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] chronicled by [[Josephus]], the majority of the Jewish population of Judea was either killed, exiled, or sold into slavery after the Bar-Kokhba Revolt, and Jewish religious and political authority was suppressed far more brutally.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; The Jews became a minority in Judea, remaining strong only in the [[Galilee]], [[Bet Shean]] and the [[Golan]].&lt;ref&gt;David Goodblatt, 'The political and social history of the Jewish community in the Land of Israel,' in William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein, Steven T. Katz (eds.)[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjtWLZhhMoYC&amp;pg=PA406 ''The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 4, The Late Roman-Rabbinic Period,''] Cambridge University Press, 2006 pp.404-430, p.406.&lt;/ref&gt; The massive destruction and loss of life occasioned by the revolt has led some scholars such as [[Bernard Lewis]] to date the beginning of the [[Jewish diaspora]] from this date. Hadrian's death in 138 CE marked a significant relief to the surviving Jewish communities. Some of the Judean survivors resettled in Galilee, with [[Sepphoris]] being one of the centers where rabbinical families from Judea relocated.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1984, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KcsUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA132 132]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabbinic Judaism]] had already become a portable religion, centered around [[synagogue]]s. 

[[Image:Ancient Galilee.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Galilee]] in [[late antiquity]]]]
Judea would not be a center of Jewish religious, cultural, or political life again until the modern era, although Jews continued to sporadically populate it and important religious developments have still taken place. The [[Galilee]] became a more important center for Rabbinic Judaism, where the Jerusalem Talmud was compiled in 4th-5th centuries CE. In the aftermath of the defeat of Bar Kokhba revolt, the consolidation of Jewish settlement in Palestine became of major concern to the rabbinate.&lt;ref name=smelik/&gt; The Sages endeavoured to halt Jewish migration into diaspora, and even banned emigration from Palestine, branding those who settled outside its borders as idolaters.&lt;ref name=smelik&gt;Willem F. Smelik, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tju-IreyEDMC&amp;pg=PA434 ''The Targum of Judges,''] BRILL 1995 p.434.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later relations between the Jews and the Roman Empire===
{{Main article|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}
The relations of the Jews with the Roman Empire in the region continued to be complicated. [[Constantine the Great and Judaism|Constantine I]] allowed Jews to mourn their defeat and humiliation once a year on [[Tisha B'Av]] at the [[Western Wall]]. In 351–352 CE, the Jews of Galilee launched [[Jewish revolt against Constantius Gallus|yet another revolt]], provoking heavy retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lazare and Robert Wistrich, Antisemitism: Its History and Causes, University of Nebraska Press, 1995, I, pp.46-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallus revolt came during the rising influence of early Christians in the Eastern Roman Empire, under the [[Constantinian dynasty]]. In 355, however, the relations with the Roman rulers improved, upon the rise of Emperor [[Julian (emperor)]], the last of the Constantinian dynasty, who unlike his predecessors defied Christianity. In 363, not long before Julian left Antioch to launch his campaign against Sasanian Persia, in keeping with his effort to foster religions other than Christianity, he ordered the Jewish Temple rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 23.1.2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to rebuild the Temple has mostly been ascribed to the dramatic [[Galilee earthquake of 363]] and traditionally also to the [[Jew]]s' ambivalence about the project. Sabotage is a possibility, as is an accidental fire. Divine intervention was the common view among Christian historians of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot;&gt;See [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/julian-jews.html &quot;Julian and the Jews 361–363 CE&quot;] (Fordham University, The Jesuit University of New York) and [http://wayback.archive.org/web/20051020130904/http://www.gibsoncondo.com/~david/convert/history.html &quot;Julian the Apostate and the Holy Temple&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Julian's support of [[Judaism|Jews]] caused Jews to call him &quot;Julian the [[Hellenes (religion)|Hellene]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A Psychoanalytic History of the Jews, [[Avner Falk]]&lt;/ref&gt; Julian's fatal wound in the Persian campaign and his consequent death had put an end to Jewish aspirations, and Julian's successors embraced Christianity through the entire timeline of Byzantine rule of Jerusalem, preventing any Jewish claims.

In 438 CE, when the Empress [[Licinia Eudoxia|Eudocia]] removed the ban on Jews' praying at the [[Temple Mount|Temple site]], the heads of the Community in Galilee issued a call &quot;to the great and mighty people of the Jews&quot; which began: &quot;Know that the end of the exile of our people has come!&quot; However the Christian population of the city who saw this as a threat to their primacy didn't allow it and a riot erupted after which they chased away the Jews from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Avraham Yaari, ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' (Tel Aviv, 1943), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com?id=8O95ErDSZQgC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=eudocia+jews+temple+mount&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HcA_VaDeN4iWuASh_YDYAw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=eudocia%20jews%20temple%20mount&amp;f=false|title=Remains of the Jews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 5th and the 6th centuries, a series of [[Samaritan Revolts|Samaritan insurrections]] broke out across the [[Palaestina Prima]] province. Especially violent were the third and the fourth revolts, which resulted in almost entire annihilation of the Samaritan community. It is likely that the Samaritan [[Samaritan Revolts|Revolt of 556]] was joined by the Jewish community, which had also suffered a brutal suppression of Israelite religion.

In the belief of restoration to come, in the early 7th century the Jews made an [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius|alliance]] with the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]], who invaded Palaestina Prima in 614, fought at their side, overwhelmed the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] garrison in Jerusalem, and were given Jerusalem to be governed as an autonomy.&lt;ref name = &quot;Phoenicia&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Itineraria Phoenicia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&amp;pg=PA542&amp;dq=Opusculum+de+Persica+captivitate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IzofU5aPGIfiqAGVoIHwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Opusculum%20de%20Persica%20captivitate&amp;f=false| author = Edward Lipiński |publisher = Peeters Publishers |pages = 542–543 |year = 2004 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their autonomy was brief: the [[Nehemiah ben Hushiel|Jewish leader]] in Jerusalem was shortly assassinated during a Christian revolt and though Jerusalem was reconquered by Persians and Jews within 3 weeks, it fell into anarchy. With the consequent withdrawal of Persian forces, Jews surrendered to Byzantines in 625 CE or 628 CE, but were massacred by Christian radicals in 629 CE, with the survivors fleeing to Egypt. The Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire) control of the region was finally lost to the Muslim Arab armies in 637 CE, when [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] completed the conquest of Akko.

===Legacy===
In the post-rabbinical era, the Bar Kokhba Revolt became a symbol of valiant national resistance. The [[Zionist youth movement]] [[Betar]] took its name from Bar Kokhba's traditional last stronghold, and [[David Ben-Gurion]], Israel's first prime minister, took his Hebrew last name from one of Bar Kokhba's generals.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/vip/BenGurion/eng/BenGurion_Bio_eng.html]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The disastrous end of the revolt also occasioned major changes in Jewish religious thought. [[Jewish messianism]] was abstracted and spiritualized, and rabbinical political thought became deeply cautious and conservative. The Talmud, for instance, refers to Bar Kokhba as &quot;Ben-Kusiba,&quot; a derogatory term used to indicate that he was a false Messiah. The deeply ambivalent rabbinical position regarding Messianism, as expressed most famously in [[Maimonides]] &quot;Epistle to Yemen,&quot; would seem to have its origins in the attempt to deal with the trauma of a failed Messianic uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Wikisource: &quot;[[s:Epistle to Yemen|Epistle to Yemen]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular children's song, included in the curriculum of Israeli kindergartens, has the refrain &quot;Bar Kokhba was a Hero/He fought for Liberty,&quot; and its words describe Bar Kokhba as being captured and thrown into a lion's den, but managing to escape riding on the lion's back.&lt;ref name=The-military-and-militarism-in-Israeli-society&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tRwTElL0pKcC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=%22Bar+Kokhba+was+a+Hero%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h6CwBDnkC4&amp;sig=wqE7xGkFXX6niO4HZ6DlAqa0tgw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RWOBTJm9J4WglAeS_sGUDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bar%20Kokhba%20was%20a%20Hero%22&amp;f=false The military and militarism in Israeli society]'' by Edna Lomsky-Feder, Eyal Ben-Ari].&quot; Retrieved on September 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic extension of the revolt==
It is generally accepted that entire Judea was involved in the Bar Kokhba revolt, namely the villages of [[Judean hills]], the Judean desert and northern parts of the [[Negev]] desert. The minimalistic approach limits the borders of the war to those areas, but there are also significant findings which may support a maximalistic view over the extent of the revolt. Among those findings are the rebel hideout systems in the Galilee, which greatly resemble the Bar Kokhba hideouts in Judea, and though are less numerable, are nevertheless important. Several historians theorize that the Tel Shalem arch is depicting a major battle between Roman armies and Bar Kokhba's rebels in Bet Shean valley, thus extending the battle areas some 50 northwards from Judea. The 2013 discovery of the military camp of [[Legio VI Ferrata]] near [[Tel Megiddo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/197910#.VdAs6vmqqko|title=Roman Legion Camp Unearthed in Megiddo - Inside Israel - News  - Arutz Sheva|work=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ongoing excavations there may shed light to extension of the rebellion to the northern valleys. A 2015 archaeological survey in Samaria identified some 40 hideout cave systems from the period, some containing Bar Kokhba's minted coins, suggesting that the war raged in Samaria at high intensity.&lt;ref name=nrg&gt;{{lang-he|התגלית שהוכיחה: מרד בר כוכבא חל גם בשומרון}} [http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/709/420.html] NRG. 15 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also evidences to support war operations on the coastal plain and as far as Transjordan.

Until 1951, the [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]] was the sole archaeological evidence for the revolt.&lt;ref name=Eshel/&gt; These coins include references to &quot;Year One of the redemption of Israel&quot;, &quot;Year Two of the freedom of Israel&quot;, and &quot;For the freedom of Jerusalem&quot;. Despite the reference to Jerusalem, recent archaeological finds, and the lack of revolt coinage found in Jerusalem, supports the view that the revolt did not capture Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Eshel-2&gt;{{harvnb|Eshel|2003|p=95-96}}: &quot;Returning to the Bar Kokhba revolt, we should note that up until the discovery of the first Bar Kokhba documents in Wadi Murabba'at in 1951, Bar Kokhba coins were the sole archaeological evidence available for dating the revolt. Based on coins overstock by the Bar Kokhba administration, scholars dated the beginning of the Bar Kokhba regime to the conquest of Jerusalem by the rebels. The coins in question bear the following inscriptions: &quot;Year One of the redemption of Israel&quot;, &quot;Year Two of the freedom of Israel&quot;, and &quot;For the freedom of Jerusalem&quot;. Up until 1948 some scholars argued that the &quot;Freedom of Jerusalem&quot; coins predated the others, based upon their assumption that the dating of the Bar Kokhba regime began with the rebel capture Jerusalem.&quot; L. Mildenberg's study of the dies of the Bar Kokhba definitely established that the &quot;Freedom of Jerusalem&quot; coins were struck later than the ones inscribed &quot;Year Two of the freedom of Israel&quot;. He dated them to the third year of the revolt.' Thus, the view that the dating of the Bar Kokhba regime began with the conquest of Jerusalem is untenable. lndeed, archeological finds from the past quarter-century, and the absence of Bar Kokhba coins in Jerusalem in particular, support the view that the rebels failed to take Jerusalem at all.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
The best recognized source for the revolt is [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' (book 69),&lt;ref name=Dio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai, Gihon. ''New insight into the Bar Kokhba War and a reappraisal of Dio Cassius 69.12-13''. University of Pennsylvania Press. The Jewish Quarterly Review Vol. 77, No. 1 (Jul., 1986), pp. 15-43. DOI: 10.2307/1454444&lt;/ref&gt; even though the writings of the Roman historian concerning the Bar Kokhba revolt survived only as fragments. The Jerusalem Talmud contains descriptions of the results of the rebellion, including the Roman executions of Judean leaders. The discovery of the [[Cave of Letters]] in the Dead Sea area, dubbed as &quot;Bar Kokhba archive&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer. ''The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered''. 2003. p184.&lt;/ref&gt; which contained letters actually written by Bar Kokhba and his followers, has added much new primary source data. Several more brief sources have been uncovered in the area over the past century, including references to the revolt from Nabatea and Roman Syria. Roman inscriptions in Tel Shalem, Betar and other locations also contribute to the current historical understanding of the Bar Kokhba War.

==Archaeology==
===Cave of Letters===
{{main article|Cave of Letters}}
[[File:BabathaScroll.jpg|thumb|A scroll found in the cave, part of the [[Babatha]] archive]]
The [[Cave of Letters]] was surveyed in the 1960-61 explorations, when letters and fragments of papyri were found that dated back to the period of the Bar Kokhba revolt 132-135. Some of these were personal letters of correspondence between [[Bar-Kokhba]] and his subordinates, and one notable bundle of papyri known as the Babata or [[Babatha]] cache revealed the life and trials of a woman, Babata, who lived during this period of time.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Roman Imperial inscription in Jerusalem===
In 2014, one half of a Latin inscription was discovered in Jerusalem during excavations near the Damascus Gate.&lt;ref name=i24news&gt;i24 News. 21 October 2014 [http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/48092-141021-rare-tribute-to-emperor-hadrian-unearthed-in-jerusalem Rare tribute to Emperor Hadrian unearthed in Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt; It was identified as the right half of a complete inscription, the other part of which was discovered nearby in the late 19th century and is currently on display in the courtyard of Jerusalem's Studium Biblicum Franciscanum Museum. The complete inscription was translated as following:
::''To the Imperator Caesar Traianus Hadrianus Augustus, son of the deified Traianus Parthicus, grandson of the deified Nerva, high priest, invested with tribunician power for the 14th time, consul for the third time, father of the country (dedicated by) the 10th legion Fretensis Antoniniana''
The inscription was dedicated by Legio X Fretensis to the emperor Hadrian in the year 129/130 CE. The inscription is considered to greatly strengthen the claim that indeed the Emperor visited Jerusalem that year, supporting the traditional claim that Hadrian's visit was among the main causes of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, and not the other way around.&lt;ref name=i24news/&gt;

===Betar fortress===
The [[Betar (fortress)|Betar]] fortress was the last standing [[Jewish]] fortress in the Bar Kokhba revolt of the 2nd century CE, destroyed by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] army of [[Emperor Hadrian]] in the year 135. The ruins of Betar, the last fortress of Bar Kokhba, is located in the vicinity of the town of [[Battir]] and the town [[Beitar Illit]]. A stone inscription bearing Latin characters and discovered near Betar shows that the [[Legio V Macedonica|Fifth Macedonian Legion]] and the [[Legio XI Claudia|Eleventh Claudian Legion]] took part in the siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;C. Clermont-Ganneau, 1899, pp. 263-270&quot;&gt;C. Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine during the Years 1873-74'', London 1899, pp. 263-270.&lt;/ref&gt;
