'''Patrick Joseph Bugden''', [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (17 March 1897 – 28 September 1917) was an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces. He served during the First World War in the [[31st Battalion (Australia)|31st Battalion]], [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] and was killed during the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]] during which he displayed the bravery for which he was posthumously awarded the VC.

==Early life==
Patrick Bugden was born in the Australian state of [[New South Wales]], at [[South Gundurimba, New South Wales|South Gundurimba]] on 17 March 1897. His father, a farmer, died when Bugden was still a child and his mother later remarried.  After completing his schooling, he worked at a hotel in [[Alstonville, New South Wales|Alstonville]]. In 1911, he commenced a year of [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory military service]].{{sfn|Foldi|1979|pp=476–477}}

==First World War==
Bugden enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] at [[Brisbane]] on 25 May 1916,{{sfn|Foldi|1979|pp=476–477}} claiming to be 21 years old. After completing a period of basic training, he embarked for England in September 1916 and arrived in Plymouth in December. Shortly afterwards he was admitted to hospital sick, before being sent to France in January 1917 and being taken on strength by the [[31st Battalion (Australia)|31st Battalion]] in March. In May 1917, he was again admitted to hospital with [[influenza]], before being released and returning to his unit.&lt;ref name=servicerecord&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=1935337&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1|title=No. 3774 Patrick Joseph Bugden, Australian Army, service record|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at [[Battle of Polygon Wood]] near [[Zonnebeke]] in Belgium, during the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele Offensive]] in the period from 26 September to 28 September 1917 that Bugden performed the actions that led to his posthumous award of the Victoria Cross. During an advance by his battalion at [[Polygon Wood]], he led small parties against strongly defended [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillbox]]es, successfully dealing with them. He later carried out a number of rescues of wounded men, often under heavy artillery and machine gun fire. He was killed during one of these rescue missions. He was later recommended for the VC;{{sfn|Foldi|1979|pp=476–477}} the citation, published in the ''London Gazette'', read:

{{Quote|For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty when, on two occasions, our advance was temporarily held up by strongly defended &quot;pill boxes&quot;. Private Bugden, in the face of devastating fire from machine guns, gallantly led small parties to attack these strong points, and, successfully silencing the machine guns with bombs, captured the garrison at the point of the bayonet. On another occasion, when a Corporal, who had become detached from his company, had been captured and was being taken to the rear by the enemy, Private Bugden, single handed, rushed to the rescue of his comrade, shot one enemy, and bayonetted the remaining two, thus releasing the Corporal. On five occasions, he rescued wounded men under intense shell and machine gun fire, showing an utter contempt and disregard for danger. Always foremost in volunteering for any dangerous mission, it was during the execution of one of these missions that this gallant soldier was killed.|The London Gazette, 23 November 1917&lt;ref name=VC&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30400|supp=yes|startpage=1239|date=23 November 1917|accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Memorials===
Bugden is buried at [[Hooge Crater Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=servicerecord/&gt; In 1997, a memorial to his service was dedicated at Alstonville, about 30&amp;nbsp;km from Tatham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paddy Bugden, VC|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/people/military/display/20062-paddy-bugden-v.c.|website=Monument Australia|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The memorial is on Bugden Avenue, and the local [[ANZAC Day]] march starts there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lembke|first1=Tony|title=Paddy Bugden, VC|url=http://whatilearnttoday.com.au/paddy-bugden-vc/|website=whatilearnttoday|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
