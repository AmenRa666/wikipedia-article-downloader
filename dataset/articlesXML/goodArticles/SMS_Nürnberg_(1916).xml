'''SMS ''Nürnberg''''' was a {{sclass-|Königsberg|cruiser (1915)|0}} [[light cruiser]] built during [[World War I]] by [[German Empire|Germany]] for the [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]]. She had three sisters: {{SMS|Königsberg|1915|2}}, {{SMS|Karlsruhe|1916|2}}, and {{SMS|Emden|1916|2}}. The ship was named after the previous light cruiser {{SMS|Nürnberg|1906|2}}, which had been sunk at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. The new cruiser was laid down in 1915 at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in Bremen, launched in April 1916, and commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] in February 1917. Armed with eight [[15 cm SK L/45|15&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/45]] guns, the ship had a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn|abbr=on}}.

''Nürnberg'' saw relatively limited service during the war, due to her commissioning late in the conflict. She participated in [[Operation Albion]] in October 1917 against the [[Russian Navy]] in the Baltic. The following month, she was engaged in the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1917)|Second Battle of Helgoland Bight]], but was not significantly damaged during the engagement. She was assigned to the final, planned operation of the High Seas Fleet that was to have taken place in the closing days of the war, though a major [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|mutiny]] forced the cancellation of the plan. After the end of the war, the ship was interned in [[Scapa Flow]]. In the [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttling of the German fleet]] in June 1919, British ships managed to beach ''Nürnberg'' and she was later refloated and sunk as a gunnery target in 1922.

==Construction==
{{main|Königsberg-class cruiser (1915)}}
''Nürnberg'' was ordered under the contract name &quot;Ersatz {{SMS|Thetis||2}}&quot; and was laid down at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]] in 1915. She was launched on 14 April 1916, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 15 February 1917. The ship was {{convert|151.4|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.2|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.96|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|7125|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of [[steam turbine]]s powered by ten coal-fired and two oil-fired Marine-type boilers. These provided a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn|abbr=on}} and a range of {{convert|4850|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=G113&gt;Gröner, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was armed with eight [[15 cm SK L/45|15&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/45]] guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], two were located on either side amidships, and two were arranged in a [[superfire|super firing pair]] aft.&lt;ref name=C162&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; They were supplied with 1,040 rounds of ammunition, for 130 shells per gun. ''Nürnberg'' also carried two {{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} L/45 anti-aircraft guns mounted on the [[wikt:centerline|centerline]] astern of the funnels. She was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s with eight torpedoes in deck-mounted swivel launchers [[amidships]]. She also carried 200 [[naval mine|mines]]. The ship was protected by a waterline [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the deck was covered with 60&amp;nbsp;mm thick armor plate.&lt;ref name=G113/&gt;

==Service history==
===Operation Albion===
[[File:Operation Albion Map.jpg|thumb|right|Operations of the German Navy and Army during Operation Albion]]
{{main|Operation Albion}}
In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of [[Riga]], the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The ''[[Admiralstab]]'' (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of [[Saaremaa|Ösel]], and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the [[Sõrve Peninsula|Sworbe Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture Ösel and [[Muhu|Moon]] Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the [[flagship]], {{SMS|Moltke||2}}, along with the III and IV&amp;nbsp;Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 214–215&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nürnberg'' and the rest of the [[II Scouting Group]], commanded by Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], provided the cruiser screen for the task force.&lt;ref name=B127&gt;Barrett, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when ''Moltke'' and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in [[Tagga Bay]] while the IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on Ösel.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; After the beginning of the bombardment, ''Nürnberg'' entered Tagga Bay with the II Transport Section and began landing troops, while ''Königsberg'' covered the landing of the I Transport Section.&lt;ref&gt;Staff ''Battle for the Baltic Islands'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; On 18&amp;ndash;19 October, the rest of the II Scouting Group covered [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] operating off the island of [[Hiiumaa|Dagö]], but due to insufficient minesweepers and bad weather, the operation was postponed.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; On the 19th, ''Nürnberg'', {{SMS|Königsberg|1915|2}}, and {{SMS|Danzig|1905|2}} were sent to intercept two Russian [[torpedo boat]]s reported to be in the area. Reuter could not locate the vessels, and broke off the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Staff ''Battle for the Baltic Islands'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; By 20 October, the islands were under German control and the Russian naval forces had either been destroyed or forced to withdraw. The ''Admiralstab'' ordered the naval component to return to the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Battle of Helgoland Bight===
{{main|Battle of Helgoland Bight (1917)}}

On 17 November, ''Nürnberg'', ''Königsberg'', {{SMS|Frankfurt||2}}, and {{SMS|Pillau||2}} were assigned to cover a minesweeping operation in the [[Helgoland Bight]], still under the command of Reuter. The force was supported by two battleships&amp;mdash;{{SMS|Kaiser|1911|2}} and {{SMS|Kaiserin||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Six British battlecruisers supported a force of light cruisers that attacked the German minesweepers. ''Königsberg'' and the other three cruisers covered the fleeing minesweepers before retreating under a smoke screen.&lt;ref name=H377&gt;Halpern, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nürnberg'' opened fire on the British cruisers at 08:55, at a range of {{convert|11|km|abbr=on}}. Heavy smoke and fog obscured the British ships, however, and ''Nürnberg'' was quickly forced to cease firing.&lt;ref&gt;Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 10:00, ''Nürnberg'' came under heavy fire from the British cruisers, as well as the powerful battlecruisers {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}}, armed with {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} guns. ''Nürnberg'' was not hit directly, but shell splinters from near misses rained down on her deck and killed one man and wounded four more, one of whom later died of his wounds. One of her [[rangefinder]]s was also damaged by the shell fragments. She returned fire briefly before the haze again concealed the British ships.&lt;ref&gt;Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kaiser'' and ''Kaiserin'' intervened at almost exactly the same time, prompting the British to break off the engagement immediately. Within an hour, the German forces were reinforced by several capital ships, including the [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Hindenburg||2}}; after realizing the British had fled, the German forces returned to port.&lt;ref&gt;Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', pp. 204&amp;ndash;205&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate===
{{main|Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow}}
In October 1918, Admirals [[Reinhard Scheer]] and [[Franz von Hipper]] planned a [[Naval order of 24 October 1918|final, climactic attack]] on the British by the High Seas Fleet. The planned operation called for raids on Allied shipping in the [[Thames estuary]] and [[Flanders]] to draw out the [[Grand Fleet]]. The German fleet would then attack the Grand Fleet and do as much damage as possible in order to enhance Germany's military position in the coming peace talks. ''Nürnberg'', {{SMS|Karlsruhe|1916|2}} and {{SMS|Graudenz||2}} were assigned to the force tasked with attacking Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on {{SMS|Thüringen||2}} and then on several other battleships [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|mutinied]]. The unrest spread to the rest of the fleet and ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, pp. 281–282&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, under the command of Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nürnberg'' was among the ships interned.&lt;ref name=G113/&gt; The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the [[Versailles Treaty]]. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.&lt;ref name=H256&gt;Herwig, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; British sailors used explosive charges to blast away ''Nürnberg''{{'}}s anchor chains so she could be dragged aground before she sank.&lt;ref&gt;van der Vat, pp. 178&amp;ndash;179&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was refloated in July and eventually expended as a [[target ship]] on 7 July 1922 off the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref name=G113/&gt;
