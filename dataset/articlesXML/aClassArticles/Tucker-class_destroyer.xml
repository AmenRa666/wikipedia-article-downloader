The '''''Tucker'' class''' of [[destroyer]]s was a [[ship class]] of six ships designed by and built for the [[United States Navy]] shortly before the United States entered [[World War I]]. The ''Tucker'' class was the fourth of five classes of destroyers that were known as the &quot;thousand tonners&quot;, because they were the first U.S. destroyers over {{convert|1000|LT|MT|0}} [[displacement (ship)|displacement]].

The design of what became the ''Tucker'' class was the result of compromises between the [[General Board of the United States Navy]] and the U.S. Navy's [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. The General Board, tasked with creating an integrated battle fleet, wanted a larger ship that could serve in a [[reconnaissance|scouting]] role and proposed a ship larger than the unique British destroyer {{HMS|Swift|1907|6}} of 1907, and more than twice the displacement of any previous U.S. destroyer. Input from Construction and Repair resulted in a design that was an incremental development of the {{sclass|O'Brien|destroyer|4}}, which itself was similar to the first of the thousand tonners, the {{sclass|Cassin|destroyer|4}} (which displaced about a third more than the preceding {{sclass|Paulding|destroyer|4}}).

The ships were built by four private American shipyards—[[Bath Iron Works]], [[Fore River Shipbuilding Company]], [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]], and [[William Cramp and Sons]]—and were [[keel laying|laid down]] between February and November 1914; [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed between April and July 1915; and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the U.S. Navy between July 1915 and May 1916. The ships had a median displacement of {{convert|1060|LT|MT}}, were just over {{convert|315|ft|m}} in length, and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of about {{convert|30|ft|m}}. Most of the ships had two direct-drive [[steam turbine]]s and a single geared cruising turbine; {{USS|Wadsworth|DD-60|2}} was equipped with two geared steam turbines only and, as the first U.S. destroyer so equipped, greatly influenced later U.S. Navy destroyer designs.&lt;ref name=Con-122 /&gt; All of the ships were designed for a maximum speed of {{convert|29.5|knots|km/h|lk=in}} and a range of {{convert|2500|nmi|km|lk=in}} at more economical speeds. As built, they were armed with four {{convert|4|in|cm|adj=on}} guns and had four twin {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s with a load of eight [[torpedo]]es, but all were later equipped with [[depth charge]]s.

All six ships operated in the Atlantic or Caribbean until the U.S. entrance into World War I in April 1917, when all six were sent overseas to [[Queenstown, Ireland]], for [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|convoy escort]] duties. Several of the ships rescued passengers and crew from ships sunk by U-boats, and several had encounters with U-boats themselves; {{USS|Jacob Jones|DD-61|2}} was torpedoed and sunk by {{SMU|U-58||2}} in December 1917. All five surviving members of the class had returned to the United States by early 1919 and been [[decommission (ship)|decommissioned]] by June 1922. Between 1924 and 1926, four of the five (all but ''Wadsworth'') were commissioned into the [[United States Coast Guard]] to help enforce [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] as a part of the &quot;[[Rum Patrol]]&quot;. They were returned to U.S. Navy custody between 1934 and 1936, and had all been sold for [[ship breaking|scrapping]] by 1936.

== Background ==
In September 1912, the [[General Board of the United States Navy]] asked the Navy's [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] (C&amp;R) to develop plans for the next class of destroyers. The General Board asked for a design with four {{convert|4|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns, six twin {{convert|21|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, and twenty [[naval mine|floating mines]], that could travel at up to {{convert|35|knots|km/h}} with steaming radius of {{endurance|2500|nmi|km|20|knots|km/h|sep=at}}.&lt;ref name=Friedman-29-31&gt;Friedman, pp. 29, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; C&amp;R came back with a design for a {{convert|385|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{convert|2160|LT|MT|adj=on}} [[displacement (ship)|displacement]], triple-[[screw propeller|screw]] &quot;super-destroyer&quot; requiring {{convert|40000|shp}} to make the design speed of {{convert|35|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=Friedman-31&gt;Friedman, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The C&amp;R design was similar to, but larger than the unique British destroyer {{HMS|Swift|1907|6}} of 1907,&lt;ref name=Friedman-31 /&gt; and more than twice the displacement of the largest U.S. destroyers.&lt;ref name=Con-122&gt;Gardiner, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The {{sclass-|Cassin|destroyer|1}}s then under construction had a displacement of {{convert|1010|LT|MT}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Board, whose main concern was the integrated operation of the United States [[:wikt:battle fleet|battle fleet]],&lt;ref name=Friedman-28&gt;Friedman, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; pushed for the design to provide more [[reconnaissance|scouting]] capabilities for fleet operations.&lt;ref name=Friedman-29&gt;Friedman, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; But the high cost of the design—$1,900,000 for hull and machinery vs. $790,000 for the {{sclass-|O'Brien|destroyer|0}} ships—and the lack of operating experience with the {{sclass-|Cassin|destroyer|4}}&lt;ref name=Con-122 /&gt;—the first of the &quot;thousand tonners&quot; (destroyers exceeding {{convert|1000|LT|MT|-1}} [[displacement (ship)|displacement]]) which were just beginning to be launched—caused C&amp;R to resist the much larger design.&lt;ref name=Friedman-31 /&gt; The Chief Constructor of the Navy, the head of C&amp;R, pointed out that the British had not repeated the ''Swift'' design in the five years since her introduction, and noted that &quot;a destroyer that gets too large loses many of the desirable features of the type&quot;.&lt;ref name=Friedman-31 /&gt;

In November 1912, the General Board offered several alternatives to reduce the size of the destroyer, and was convinced by C&amp;R that the most practical solution was a design that shared much with the ''O'Brien'' class: matching that class' main battery and torpedo load but with a design speed of {{convert|29.5|knots|km/h}} and the desired {{convert|2500|nmi|km|adj=on}} steaming radius. The General Board also specified that the ships be equipped with &quot;two aeroplane guns, if they can be developed and installed&quot;, have provisions for laying thirty-six mines, and a strengthened bow for [[ramming#Sea warfare|ramming]]. The C&amp;R design for the ''Tucker'' class, DD-57 through DD-62,&lt;ref name=hull-note group=Note&gt;Although the [[United States Navy]]'s [[hull classification symbol|hull classification system]] in which destroyers were assigned the hull code of ''DD'' was not adopted until July 1920, most sources retroactively apply the numbering system. So, for example, the [[lead ship]] of the class is referred to in sources as {{USS|Tucker|DD-57|3}} rather than as ''Tucker'' (Destroyer No. 57), even though the latter name is the one she was known by throughout most of her U.S. Navy career. Similarly, because {{USS|Jacob Jones|DD-61|2}} was sunk in 1917, she was never known by ''DD-61'' while afloat, but is referred to by that hull code in sources.&lt;/ref&gt; was approved by the [[Secretary of the Navy (United States)|Secretary of the Navy]] in December 1912, and authorized by [[Congress (United States)|Congress]] in 1913.&lt;ref name=Con-122 /&gt;

== Design ==
As built, the ''Tucker''-class ships were {{convert|315|ft|3|in}} in length ([[length overall|overall]]), were between {{convert|29|ft|9|in|m}} and {{convert|30|ft|6|in|m}} [[abeam]], and had a median [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|9|ft|4|in|m}}. The hull shape featured the distinctive high forecastle typical of U.S. destroyer classes since the 1908–09 {{sclass-|Smith|destroyer|4}}, the first destroyers designed to be truly ocean-going vessels.&lt;ref name=Con-121&gt;Gardiner, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The ships [[displace (ship)|displace]]d between {{convert|1060|and|1150|LT|MT}} with a median of {{convert|1060|LT|MT}}.&lt;ref name=Bauer-171 /&gt;

The ships were equipped with two [[propeller shaft (ship)|propeller shaft]]s and two Curtis [[steam turbine]]s fed by four [[Yarrow boiler]]s, providing a minimum of {{convert|17000|shp}} to achieve the design speed of {{convert|29.5|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=Con-123&gt;Gardiner, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; For all of the ships except {{USS|Wadsworth|DD-60|2}}, the pair of main turbines was supplemented with a cruising turbine geared to one of the shafts.&lt;ref name=Con-123 /&gt; ''Wadsworth'' had no cruising turbines, but instead had her twin turbines geared directly to the propeller shafts—the first American destroyer so outfitted.&lt;ref name=Friedman-29 /&gt; She served as a testbed,&lt;ref name=Friedman-29 /&gt; and had a considerable effect on U.S. destroyer design after her trials in July 1915.&lt;!-- date of trials --&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman-29 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Con-123 /&gt;&lt;!-- considerable effect --&gt;

The main [[artillery battery|battery]] of the ''Tucker'' class consisted of four {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}}/50 Mark 9 guns,&lt;!-- number, size --&gt;&lt;ref name=Con-123 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NavWeaps-4in&gt;{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = United States of America: 4&quot;/50 (10.2 cm) Marks 7, 8, 9 and 10 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_4-50_mk9.htm | work = Naval Weapons of the World | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 15 August 2008 | accessdate = 6 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- calibers --&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The ''50'' denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 50 [[calibers#Caliber as measurement of length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 50 times as long as it is in diameter, {{convert|200|in|m}} in this case. The Mark number is the version of the gun; in this case, the ninth U.S. Navy design of the 4-inch/50 gun.&lt;/ref&gt; with each gun weighing in excess of {{convert|6100|lbs|kg}}.&lt;ref name=NavWeaps-4in /&gt; The guns fired {{convert|33|lbs|kg|adj=on}} [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] [[projectile]]s at {{convert|2900|ft/s|m/s}}. At an [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] of 20°, the guns had a range of {{convert|15920|yards|m}}.&lt;ref name=NavWeaps-4in /&gt;

The ''Tucker'' class was also equipped with four twin {{convert|21|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, for a total load of eight [[Mark 8 torpedo]]es. Although the General Board had called for two [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] for the ''Tucker'' class, they were not originally outfitted with the weapons; the {{sclass|Sampson|destroyer|4}} was the first American destroyer class so armed.&lt;ref name=Friedman-31 /&gt; Likewise, there is no record of any of the ''Tucker'' ships being outfitted with mine-laying apparatus. During World War I, most American destroyers were used in [[anti-submarine warfare]] roles, and were equipped with [[depth charge]]s and delivery systems, such as [[Y-gun]]s and depth charge racks.&lt;ref name=Con-121&gt;Gardiner, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tucker''-class ships were equipped with depth charges during the war,&lt;ref name=DANFS-all_six /&gt; but no specific mentions of the types of depth charges used or delivery system are recorded in available sources.&lt;ref name=Bauer-171 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Con-123 /&gt;

[[File:Rum Patrol ships Tucker and Cassin.jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|Tucker|DD-57|2}} ''(left)'' and {{USS|Cassin|DD-43|2}}, the [[lead ship]]s of their respective classes, show the design similarities between the {{sclass|Cassin|destroyer|5}} and ''Tucker'' classes.]]

=== Comparisons with other &quot;thousand tonners&quot; ===
The &quot;thousand tonners&quot; were the 26 United States Navy destroyers of five classes—''Cassin'', {{sclass|Aylwin|destroyer|5}}, ''O'Brien'', ''Tucker'', and ''Sampson''—so named because they were the first U.S. Navy destroyers to have displacements greater than 1,000 long tons&lt;!-- not converted since it's converted in previous paragraph --&gt;.&lt;ref name=Con-122-123&gt;Gardiner, pp. 122–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The {{sclass|Aylwin|destroyer|4}} is considered a part of the {{sclass|Cassin|destroyer|4}} by ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921'' (p. 122), but is classed separately by the United States Navy. See, for example, {{cite DANFS | author = [[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]] | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/a15/aylwin-ii.htm | title = Aylwin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cassin'' class, the first of the thousand tonners, displaced about a third more than the preceding {{sclass-|Paulding|destroyer|4}}.&lt;ref name=Con-122-123 /&gt; The introduction of the thousand tonners led to the ''Paulding''s and other older, smaller displacement destroyers of previous classes to be dismissively called &quot;flivvers&quot;,&lt;ref name=Con-121 /&gt; a nickname also commonly applied to the [[Ford Model T]].&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;According to Cashman (p. 278), a flivver—a [[portmanteau]] of &quot;for the liver&quot;—was any small, inexpensive automobile that shook the liver while in motion.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tucker'' class was the fourth of the five classes of &quot;thousand tonners&quot;. The earlier ''Cassin''- (DD-43 to DD-46), ''Aylwin''- (DD-47 to DD-50) and ''O'Brien''-class (DD-51 to DD-56) ships were about {{convert|10|ft|m}} shorter than the ''Tucker'' ships and had a lower displacement, between {{convert|40|and|80|LT|MT|0}} less than the median displacement of the ''Tucker''s; the later ''Sampson''-class (DD-63 to DD-68) ships were the same length and displaced {{convert|10|LT|MT|0}} more. All five classes were armed with four {{convert|4|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns, but the torpedo size and complement varied. All were equipped with four twin [[torpedo tube]]s loaded with eight [[torpedo]]es except for the ''Sampson''s (which had four triple tubes carrying twelve torpedoes), but the ''Cassin''  and ''Aylwin'' classes were armed with {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} torpedoes; the rest with {{convert|21|in|mm|0|adj=on}} torpedoes. The ''Sampson''s were the only group originally equipped with [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]], a pair of [[QF 1 pounder pom-pom|{{convert|1|pdr|adj=on}} guns]] with a [[caliber#Firearms|caliber]] of {{convert|37|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Con-122-123 /&gt;

== Construction ==
[[File:USS Tucker (DD-57), under construction January 1915.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Tucker|DD-57|2}} under construction at the [[Fore River Shipbuilding Company]] on 1 January 1915.]] 
The construction of the six ''Tucker''-class ships was allocated to four U.S. shipbuilders. The [[Fore River Shipbuilding Company]] and [[Bath Iron Works]] built one ship each, while [[William Cramp and Sons|William Cramp]] and [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation|New York Shipbuilding]] each constructed a pair of ''Tucker'' destroyers.&lt;ref name=Con-123&gt;Gardiner, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[keel]]s for all six ships were [[keel laying|laid down]] between February and November 1914, with ''Wadsworth'' being the first and {{USS|Tucker|DD-57|2}} the last.&lt;ref name=Bauer-171&gt;Bauer and Roberts, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; All were [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed between April and July 1915, with ''Wadsworth'' again being the first and {{USS|Porter|DD-59|2}} being the last.&lt;ref name=Con-123 /&gt; ''Wadsworth'' was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed in July 1915, three months after her launch; the rest were commissioned between January and May 1916, with {{USS|Wainwright|DD-62|2}} the final ship to enter service.&lt;ref name=Bauer-171 /&gt;

==Ships in class==
All six members of the class served in the Atlantic throughout their U.S. Navy careers, and all were sent overseas to [[Queenstown, Ireland]], for convoy escort and [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] duties after the United States entered World War I in April 1917.&lt;ref name=DANFS-all_six&gt;[[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]].

After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, ''Tucker'' was part of the second U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the [[Irish Sea]] out of [[Queenstown, Ireland]], ''Tucker'' made several rescues of passengers and crew from ships sunk by U-boats. For her part in rescuing crewmen from the [[French armoured cruiser Dupetit-Thouars (1901)|''Dupetit-Thouars'']] in August 1918, ''Tucker'' received a commendation from the ''[[Préfet Maritime]]''. In June, ''Tucker'' was transferred to [[Brest, France]], and spent the remainder of the war there.&lt;ref name=DANFS-Tucker&gt;{{cite DANFS | author = Naval History &amp; Heritage Command | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t9/tucker-i.htm | title = Tucker | short = on | accessdate = 6 May 2009 | link = off }}&lt;/ref&gt;
