'''SMS ''Oldenburg''''' {{efn|name=SMS}} was an armored warship of the [[German Imperial Navy]]. Laid down at the [[AG Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Stettin]] in 1883, the ship was launched in December 1884 and commissioned into the Navy in April 1886. ''Oldenburg'' was intended to have been a fifth member of the {{sclass|Sachsen|ironclad|4}} of sortie corvettes, but budgetary limitations and dissatisfaction with the ''Sachsen'' class prompted a redesign that bore little resemblance to the earlier vessels. ''Oldenburg'' mounted her main battery of eight {{convert|24|cm|abbr=on}} guns amidships, six in a central casemate on the main deck and two directly above them on the [[broadside]]. She was the first German capital ship constructed entirely from German-made steel.

''Oldenburg'' did not see significant service with the German Navy. She participated in fleet training maneuvers in the late-1880s and early 1890s, but she spent the majority of the 1890s in reserve. Her only major deployment came in 1897–1898 when she joined an international naval demonstration to protest the Greek annexation of [[Crete]]. In 1900, she was withdrawn from active duty and used as a harbor defense ship. From 1912 to 1919, she was used by the [[High Seas Fleet]] as a target ship; she was sold for scrapping in 1919 and broken up that year.

== Design ==

''Oldenburg'' was intended to be a fifth member of the {{sclass|Sachsen|ironclad|4}} of sortie corvettes. The design for the ship was radically altered,{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=135}} between 1879 and 1881,{{sfn|Gröner|p=8}} for a variety of reasons. The German Navy was largely dissatisfied with the ''Sachsen'' class ships, and a number of design faults required correction.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=135}} Budgetary constraints also limited the design of the ship,{{sfn|Gardiner|p=246}} forcing the design staff to work within a displacement some {{convert|2000|MT|abbr=on}} lower than that of the ''Sachsen''s.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=8–9}}

Assessment of the design is mixed; naval historian Erich Gröner states that ''Oldenburg'' was an &quot;experimental design, of no real value in combat.&quot;{{sfn|Gröner|p=9}} ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships'' concurs, stating that ''Oldenburg'' was &quot;considered to be of little fighting value by the time she was completed.&quot;{{sfn|Gardiner|p=246}} The 1889 edition of the ''Brassey's Naval Annual'' reported a contradictory opinion, however, stating that &quot;The majority of German naval critics are dissatisfied to a greater or less extent with all of these vessels, the {{SMS|König Wilhelm||2}}, {{SMS|Kaiser|1874|2}}, {{SMS|Deutschland|1874|2}}, and ''Oldenburg'' excepted.&quot;{{sfn|Brassey|pp=76–77}}

=== General characteristics ===

[[File:SMS Oldenburg linedrawing.png|thumb|left|Line-drawing of ''Oldenburg'']]

''Oldenburg'' was {{convert|78.40|m|abbr=on}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|79.80|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. She had a beam of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a draft of {{convert|6.28|m|ft|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|6.30|m|abbr=on}} aft. At the designed [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]], the vessel displaced {{convert|5249|MT|sp=us}}. When the ship was fully loaded, she displaced {{convert|5743|MT|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gröner|p=9}} Her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was built with transverse and longitudinal steel frames; iron was used for the [[Stem (ship)|stem]] and [[stern]]. The ship had twelve [[watertight compartment]]s and a [[double bottom]] that ran for 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the length of the hull.{{sfn|Gröner|p=8}} ''Oldenburg'' was the first German capital ship built entirely from German-made steel.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=166}}

The German navy regarded ''Oldenburg'' as an adequate sea boat, though she suffered from significant [[:wikt:pitching|pitching]]. As a result of her tendency to pitch severely, a {{convert|60|MT|abbr=on}} [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] was permanently installed in the bow. She also lost a great deal of speed in heavy seas; at conditions above [[Beaufort scale|Beaufort sea state 6]], this could be up to a 25&amp;nbsp;percent loss of speed. The ship could not operate under severe weather conditions. Her transverse [[metacentric height]] was {{convert|.63|m|abbr=on}}. Her standard complement consisted of 34 officers and 355 enlisted men, though her crew was later reorganized to 32 officers and 40 enlisted sailors. She carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one [[Launch (boat)|launch]], two [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnace]]s, two [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]s, two [[yawl]]s, and one [[dinghy]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=9}}

=== Machinery ===
[[File:S.M. Linienschiff Oldenburg.jpg|thumb|Painting of ''Oldenburg'' in 1902]]
''Oldenburg'' was powered by two horizontal 4-cylinder double expansion steam engines in separate engine roomes; the two engines each drove a three-bladed screw {{convert|4.50|m|abbr=on}} in diameter. Steam was provided to the engines by eight transverse cylinder boilers, divided into two boiler rooms. Each boiler was equipped with three fireboxes, for a total of 24, which operated at up to {{convert|5|atm|lk=on}} forced. The engines were designed to operate at {{convert|3900|ihp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|14|kn|lk=in}}. On speed trials, her engines slightly exceeded the designed horsepower, at {{convert|3942|ihp|abbr=on}}, though ''Oldenburg'' made only {{convert|13.8|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|p=9}}

The ship was designed to store {{convert|348|MT|abbr=on}} of coal, though she could accommodate up to {{convert|450|MT|abbr=on}}. An additional {{convert|120|MT|abbr=on}} of coal could be stored on her deck. At a cruising speed of {{convert|9|kn}}, ''Oldenburg'' could steam for {{convert|1770|nmi|lk=in}}. Increasing her speed by one knot reduced her range to {{convert|1370|nmi|abbr=on}}, and at {{convert|12|kn}}, she could cruise for only {{convert|980|nmi|abbr=on}}. Steering was controlled by a single rudder. She was equipped with three electrical generators with a total output of 29&amp;nbsp;kilowatts at 65&amp;nbsp;[[volt]]s.{{sfn|Gröner|p=9}}

=== Armament and armor ===

''Oldenburg'' carried eight {{convert|24|cm|abbr=on}} L/30 hooped guns in an unusual configuration: six guns on the main deck, one on each broadside, four in [[embrasure]]s at each corner of the central battery to give a measure of end-on fire, and two on the upper deck firing broadside.{{sfn|Gröner|p=9}}{{sfn|Gardiner|p=246}} These guns were supplied with 494 rounds of ammunition, and could depress to −5° and elevate to 8°. This enabled a maximum range of {{convert|5700|to|8800|m|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gröner|p=9}} She was also equipped with four {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} L/22 guns and two {{convert|8.7|cm|abbr=on}} L/24 guns. Four {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s rounded out her armament. One was mounted in the bow, submerged, two were placed on the [[broadside]] above water, and the fourth was located in the stern, also above water. She carried ten torpedoes.{{sfn|Gröner|p=9}}{{sfn|Gardiner|p=246}}

''Oldenburg''{{'}}s armor consisted of compound steel backed with [[teak]]; the steel was fabricated by the [[Dillinger Hütte|Dillinger Works]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=166}} The main [[belt armor|armored belt]] was composed of two [[strake]]s; the steel upper strake was {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[amidships]], where it protected the ship's vitals. The belt was reduced on either end of the central portion to {{convert|200|mm|abbr=on}}. The lower strake was {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} thick in the central section and {{convert|180|mm|abbr=on}} on either end. The entire belt was backed with 250&amp;nbsp;mm of teak amidships and 300&amp;nbsp;mm of teak on either end. The sides of the armored [[casemate]]s for the main battery were {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The ship's deck was {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} thick. Her forward [[conning tower]] had {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides and a {{convert|25|mm|abbr=on}} thick roof. The rear conning tower was given only splinter protection, with {{convert|15|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides and a {{convert|12|mm|abbr=on}} thick roof.{{sfn|Gröner|p=8}}

== Service history ==

[[File:1866 Hochhaus Bau der Oldenburg auf der Werft Vulcan anagoria.JPG|thumb|Carl Hochhaus: ''Construction of the Oldenburg at the Vulcan Shipyard'', 1886, [[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-C0079, Panzerschiff Oldenburg.jpg|thumb|SMS ''Oldenburg'' in port]]

''Oldenburg'' was laid down in 1883 at the [[AG Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Stettin]], under construction number 132. She was launched on 20 December 1884, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was completed by April 1886 and commissioned into the German Navy on 8 April.{{sfn|Gröner|p=9}} She immediately joined the I Division of the fleet, alongside {{SMS|Sachsen|1877|2}}, {{SMS|Bayern|1878|2}}, and {{SMS|Württemberg|1878|2}}, for the annual fleet maneuvers. ''Bayern'' and ''Württemberg'' suffered from engine troubles throughout the exercises, but ''Oldenburg'' performed satisfactorily.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=163}}

In June 1887, Germany dedicated the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]]; ''Oldenburg'' was among the ships present during the celebrations. ''Oldenburg'' was assigned to the training squadron for the maneuvers in August–September 1887, along with {{SMS|König Wilhelm||2}} and {{SMS|Kaiser|1874|2}}. The majority of the exercises were focused in the Baltic, but the fleet did conduct maneuvers in the North Sea for eight days in September.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=171}} ''Oldenburg'' also participated in the visit to Great Britain in August 1889, where Wilhelm II took part in the [[Cowes Regatta]]. The ship was assigned to the I Division with ''Sachsen'', {{SMS|Baden|1880|2}}, and the new cruiser {{SMS|Irene||2}}. ''Oldenburg'' and the rest of the fleet joined the [[Royal Navy]] in a [[fleet review]] for [[Queen Victoria]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=179}}

''Oldenburg'' participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of [[Helgoland]] from British to German control in the summer of 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading [[Kiel]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=192}} She remained with the I Division in 1891; the year's maneuvers simulated a two-front war against Russia and either France or Denmark. In 1892, however, ''Württemberg'' replaced ''Oldenburg'' in the I Division, and the latter went into reserve.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=194}} The ship remained out of service for the next five years. She returned to active duty in 1897 to join an international naval demonstration off the island of [[Crete]], which had been annexed by Greece. The ship remained in the demonstration until March 1898, when Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] withdrew their naval contingents in a show of dissatisfaction over the compromise solution, which left Crete under Ottoman control, but with a Greek prince.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=220}}

In 1900, ''Oldenburg'' was reduced to serve as a harbor [[guard ship]]. She was later used as a [[depot ship]] before being stricken from the [[naval register]] on 13 January 1912. The vessel was then used as a target ship by the [[High Seas Fleet]] until after the German defeat in [[World War I]]. ''Oldenburg'' was sold to Hattinger Company, a ship-breaking firm, on 5 May 1919. The ship was dismantled for scrap in Wilhelmshaven that year.{{sfn|Gröner|p=9}}
