'''''Blood Diamond''''' is a 2006 German-American [[Political film|political]] [[War film|war]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] film co-produced and directed by [[Edward Zwick]], starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Jennifer Connelly]] and [[Djimon Hounsou]]. The title refers to [[blood diamond]]s, which are diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance conflicts, and thereby profit warlords and diamond companies across the world.

Set during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] in 1991–2002, the film depicts a country torn apart by the struggle between government loyalists and insurgent forces. It also portrays many of the atrocities of that war, including the rebels' amputation of people's hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections.

The film's ending, in which a conference is held concerning blood diamonds, refers to a historic meeting that took place in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]] in 2000. It led to development of the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]], which sought to certify the origin of rough diamonds in order to curb the trade in conflict diamonds, but has since been mostly abandoned as ineffective.

The film received mixed but generally favorable reviews, with praise directed mainly to the performances of DiCaprio and Hounsou; they were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], respectively.

==Plot==
It is 1999 and [[Sierra Leone]] is [[Sierra Leone Civil War|ravaged]] by major political unrest. Rebel factions such as the [[Revolutionary United Front]] frequently terrorize the countryside, intimidating [[Mende people|Mende]] locals and enslaving many to harvest diamonds, which fund their increasingly successful war effort. One such unfortunate local is fisherman Solomon Vandy ([[Djimon Hounsou]]) from [[Shenge]], who is separated from his family and assigned to a workforce overseen by Captain Poison ([[David Harewood]]), a ruthless warlord.

One morning, Vandy discovers an enormous pink diamond in the riverbank. Captain Poison tries to take the stone, but the area is suddenly raided by government troops. Vandy buries the stone before being captured. Both Vandy and Poison are incarcerated in [[Freetown]], along with Danny Archer ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]), a [[White people in Zimbabwe|white]] [[Rhodesia]]n [[arms trafficking|gunrunner]] jailed while trying to smuggle diamonds into [[Liberia]]. They were intended for Rudolph van de Kaap, a corrupt [[South Africa]]n mining executive.

Hearing of the pink diamond in prison, Archer arranges for himself and Vandy to be freed from detention. He travels to [[Cape Town]] to meet his employer: Colonel Coetzee ([[Arnold Vosloo]]), an [[Afrikaner]] formerly with the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]]-era [[South African Defence Force]], who now commands a [[private military company]]. Archer wants the diamond so he can sell it and leave the continent forever, but Coetzee wants it as compensation for Archer's botched smuggling mission. Archer returns to Sierra Leone, locates Vandy, and offers to help him find his family if he will help recover the diamond. 

Meanwhile, RUF insurgents escalate hostilities; Freetown falls to their advance while Vandy's son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) is among those rounded up to serve as a [[military use of children|child soldier]] under a liberated Captain Poison. Archer and Vandy narrowly escape to [[Lungi, Sierra Leone|Lungi]], where they plan to reach [[Kono district|Kono]] with an American journalist, Maddy Bowen ([[Jennifer Connelly]]); in exchange, Archer will provide evidence on the illicit diamond trade. The trio arrive in Kono after a harrowing journey, where Coetzee and his private army — contracted by the Sierra Leone government — prepares to repulse the rebel offensive.

While Maddy gets out with her story, the two men set out for Captain Poison's encampment. Dia, stationed with the RUF garrison there, is confronted by Vandy, but having been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] he refuses to acknowledge his father. Archer radios the site's coordinates to Coetzee, who directs a combined air and ground assault on the camp; Vandy finds Captain Poison and beats him to death with a shovel as the mercenaries overwhelm the RUF defenders. Coetzee then forces Vandy to produce the diamond, but is killed by Archer, who realizes Coetzee would eventually kill them both. Dia holds the pair briefly at gunpoint, but Vandy confronts him again and renews their bond. Pursued by vengeful mercenaries, Archer discloses he has been mortally wounded and entrusts the stone to Vandy, telling him to take it for his family. Vandy and his son rendezvous with Archer's pilot, who flies them to safety while Archer makes a final phone call to Maddy; they share final farewells as he asks her to assist Vandy, and gives her permission to finish her article. Archer finally takes in the beautiful African landscape before (presumably) dying. 

Vandy arrives in London and meets with a van de Kaap representative; he exchanges the pink diamond for a large sum of money and being reunited with his entire family. Maddy takes photographs of the deal to publish in her article on the diamond trade, exposing van de Kaap's criminal actions. Vandy appears as a guest speaker at a conference on &quot;[[blood diamonds]]&quot; in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], and is met with a standing ovation.

== Production ==
[[Charles Leavitt]] was hired by [[Warner Bros.]] in February 2004 to rewrite an early draft of the film, then titled ''Okavango''.&lt;ref name=Okavango&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117900672.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1| title = WB leaving 'Okavango' to Leavitt| accessdate = 2014-11-01| author = Dunkley, Cathy| date = 24 February 2004| publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story had been stuck in &quot;[[development hell]]&quot; at the studio for years before producers [[Paula Weinstein]] and [[Gillian Gorfil]] finally decided on the story of an African farmer caught up in the conflict between an American smuggler and the local diamond mining organization.&lt;ref name=Okavango/&gt; Leavitt researched the diamond industry to great lengths before he began writing the [[screenplay]], explaining that he has &quot;always been a stickler for immersing [himself] in research&quot;.&lt;ref name=WGA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=3136 |title=''Diamond'' Scribe |accessdate=2014-11-01 |author=Faye, Denis |year=2006 |publisher=[[Writers Guild of America, west]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102054428/http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=3136 |archivedate=2014-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the film with the assumption that it would offend the diamond industry, particularly [[De Beers]], and so made sure to portray the industry truthfully, aware that he could potentially be sued by De Beers and other powerful mining corporations.&lt;ref name=WGA/&gt; Paula Weinstein was impressed by Leavitt's ''Blood Diamond'' draft, but hired writers [[Ed Zwick]] and [[Marshall Herskovitz]] to rewrite the script again; by the time he had completed the script, Zwick had become so interested in the story that he agreed to direct the film as well.&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117925274.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1| title = WB polishes 'Diamond'| accessdate = 2014-11-01| author = Brodesser, Claude| date = 28 June 2005| publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
{{Anchor|Critics}}
[[File:Leonardo DiCaprio 2010.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in the film was particularly praised by most of the critics.]]
Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 62% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 211 reviews, with an average score of 6.3/10, making the film a &quot;fresh&quot; on the website's rating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;RottenTomatoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_diamond |title=''Blood Diamond'' |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixster |accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 64, based on 39 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metacritic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blood-diamond |title=''Blood Diamond'' |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Puig of the ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film a positive review, stating that &quot;''Blood Diamond'' is a gem in a season with lots of worthy movies.&quot; Puig also praised DiCaprio's acting and noting that &quot;it is also the first time the boyish actor has truly seemed like a man on film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Puig&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2006-12-07-review-blood-diamond_x.htm |author=Puig, Claudia |title=''Blood Diamond'' shines forth |work=USAToday.com |publisher=Gannett Co. Inc |date=December 7, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Rainer]] of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' also gave the film a positive review. He, like Puig, also praised DiCaprio's acting, stating: &quot;As strong as ''Blood Diamond'' is in its best moments, I wish it had been even harder-edged. DiCaprio is remarkable - his work is almost on par with his performance this year in ''The Departed''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rainer&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1208/p16s01-almo.html |author=Rainer, Peter |title=Star-studded, flawed diamond |work=CSMonitor.com |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |date=December 8, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Arnold of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' gave the film a positive review, stating: &quot;Zwick's narrative skills keep us hooked on the story, and the first-rate production values and imaginative use of locations (it was shot in Mozambique) give the film an enthralling scope and epic sweep.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/Blood-Diamond-is-a-multicarat-message-movie-1221798.php |author=Arnold, William |title=''Blood Diamond'' is a multicarat message movie |work=SeattlePI.com |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc |date=December 7, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damon Wise of the ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine gave the film four-stars-out-of-five, he stated: &quot;Great performances, provocative ideas and gripping action scenes fall prey to Hollywood logic and pat storytelling in the final hour.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=11263 |author=Wise, Damon |title=''Blood Diamond'' |work=EmpireOnline.com |publisher=Bauer Consumer Media |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Edelstein]] of the ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine also gave the film a positive review, stating: &quot;Given that the movie doesn't have a single narrative surprise--you always know where it's going and why, commercially speaking, it's going there--it's amazing how good ''Blood Diamond'' is. I guess that's the surprise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edelstein&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/25009 |author=Edelstein, David |title=They Cut Glass. And Hands. |work=NYMag.com |publisher=New York Media LLC |date=December 3, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Hornaday of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' also praised DiCaprio's acting, saying that he &quot;who between this outing and ''The Departed'' has undergone a major growth spurt this year.&quot; About the film itself, she stated: &quot;For its flaws, ''Blood Diamond'' is a gem, if only for being an unusually smart, engaged popcorn flick.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hornaday&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/blood-diamond,1125578/critic-review.html#reviewNum1 |author=Hornaday, Ann |title=''Blood Diamond'' |work=WashingtonPost.com |date=December 8, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Berardinelli]] of the ''[[ReelViews]]'' gave the film three-out-of-four-stars, stating: &quot;It's a solid performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, who has grown into this sort of &quot;gritty&quot; role and is more believable after having been seen dancing on the dark side in ''The Departed''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berardinelli&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/blood_diamond.html |title=Review: ''Blood Diamond'' |author=Berardinelli, James |work=ReelViews.net |year=2007 |accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dana Stevens (critic)|Dana Stevens]] of the ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine is also among those who gave the film a positive review, she stated: &quot;''Blood Diamond'' is a by-the-numbers message picture, to be sure... But the director, Edward Zwick, is craftsman enough that the pace never slackens, the chase scenes thrill, and the battle scenes sicken. And if it makes viewers think twice about buying their sweethearts that hard-won hunk of ice for Christmas, so much the better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2006/12/trading_spaces.html |author=Stevens, Dana |title=Trading Spaces |work=Slate.com |publisher=The Slate Group, LLC |date=December 8, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ty Burr]] of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', after giving the film a positive review, stated: &quot;As an entry in the advocacy-entertainment genre, in which glamorous movie stars bring our attention to the plight of the less fortunate, ''Blood Diamond'' is superior to 2003's ridiculous ''Beyond Borders'' while looking strident and obvious next to last year's ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2006/12/08/diamond_trades_on_action_and_star_appeal |author=Burr, Ty |title='Diamond' trades on action and star appeal |work=Boston.com |date=December 8, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pete Vonder Haar of the ''[[Film Threat]]'' gave the film a mixed review, stating: &quot;It's a reasonably entertaining actioner, and Zwick doesn't shy away from depicting violence or the horrors of war, but as a social statement it falls a little short. And emeralds are prettier anyway.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;VonderHaar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/9480 |author=Vonder Haar, Pete |title=''Blood Diamond'' |work=FilmThread.com |publisher=Hamster Stampede LLC |year=2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Savlov of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' also gave the film a mixed review, he stated: &quot;While the film never quite reaches the emotional peaks it so obviously seeks to scale, Zwick's film is still potent enough to save you three months salary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savlov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2006-12-08/425465 |author=Savlov, Marc |title=''Blood Diamond'' |work=AustinChronicle.com |publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp |date=December 8, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Lee of the ''[[Village Voice]]'', like Vonder Haar and Savlov, also gave the film a mixed review, stating that &quot;De Beers can relax; the only indignation stirred up by ''Blood Diamond'' won't be among those who worry about where their jewelry came from, but with audiences incensed by facile politics and bad storytelling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-11-28/film/say-it-with-diamonds |author=Lee, Nathan |title=Say It with Diamonds? |work=Village Voice |publisher=Village Voice, LLC |date=November 28, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Tobias of the ''[[A.V. Club]]'' gave the film &quot;C&quot;, he stated: &quot;Much like Zwick's ''Glory'' and ''The Last Samurai'', ''Blood Diamond'' strives to be an &quot;important&quot; film while stopping well short of being genuinely provocative and artistically chancy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tobias&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/blood-diamond,3674 |author=Tobias, Scott |title=''Blood Diamond'' |work=AVClub.com |publisher=Onion Inc |date=December 7, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' gave the film a negative review, stating that &quot;director Edward Zwick tried to make a great movie, but somewhere in the process he forgot to make a good one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LaSalle&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Romancing-the-enormous-conflict-diamond-2543905.php |author=LaSalle, Mick |title=Romancing the enormous conflict diamond |work=SFGate.com |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc |date=December 8, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
