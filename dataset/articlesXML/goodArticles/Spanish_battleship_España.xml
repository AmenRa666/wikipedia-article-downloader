'''''España''''' was a Spanish [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]], the [[lead ship]] of [[España class battleship|her class]]. She had two [[sister ship]]s, [[Spanish battleship Alfonso XIII|''Alfonso XIII'']] and [[Spanish battleship Jaime I|''Jaime I'']]. ''España'' was built by the [[Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval|SECN]] shipyard; she was laid down in December 1909, launched in February 1912, and completed in October 1913. She was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} guns and had a top speed of {{convert|19.5|kn|lk=in}}

''España'' served in the 1st Squadron after her commissioning, along with her two sisters. Spain remained neutral during [[World War I]], so the Spanish fleet did not see action during the conflict. ''España'' provided gunfire support during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] in the early 1920s. During these operations, she ran aground off [[Cape Tres Forcas]], Morocco in August 1923. The Navy was unable to raise the ship, and severe storms destroyed the wreck in 1924, which led the Navy to abandon her.

==Technical characteristics==
{{main|España-class battleship}}

''España'' was {{convert|132.6|m|abbr=on}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|140|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7.8|m|abbr=on}}; her [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] was {{convert|15|ft|abbr=on}} [[amidships]]. Her propulsion system consisted of four-shaft [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s and twelve [[Yarrow boiler]]s. The engines were rated at {{convert|15500|shp|lk=in}} and produced a top speed of {{convert|19.5|kn|lk=in}}. ''España'' had a cruising radius of {{convert|5000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. Her crew consisted of 854&amp;nbsp;officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=GG378&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

''España'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} /50 guns, mounted in four twin [[gun turret]]s. One turret was placed forward, two were positioned [[en echelon]] amidships, and the fourth was aft of the [[superstructure]].&lt;ref name=GG378/&gt; This mounting scheme was chosen in preference to [[:wikt:superimposed|superimposed]] turrets, as was done in the {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship|5}}s, to save weight and cost.&lt;ref name=Fi856/&gt; Her secondary battery consisted of twenty {{convert|102|mm|abbr=on}} guns mounted in [[casemate]]s along the length of the hull. They were too close to the waterline, however, which made them unusable in heavy seas. She was also armed with four 3-pounder guns and two machine guns. Her [[belt armor|armored belt]] was {{convert|203|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships; the main battery turrets were protected with the same amount of armor plate. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|254|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides. Her armored deck was {{convert|38|mm|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name=GG378/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Acorazado España (en 1913).svg|thumb|left|Line-drawing of ''España'' as she appeared in 1913]]
The Navy Law of 7 January 1908 authorized construction of ''España''.&lt;ref name=Fi856&gt;Fitzsimons, p. 856&lt;/ref&gt; She was laid down at the ''[[Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval]]'' shipyard in [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] on 6 December 1909. She was launched on 5 February 1912, and completed on 23 October 1913.&lt;ref name=GG378/&gt; After their completion, ''España'' and her sisters, [[Spanish battleship Alfonso XIII|''Alfonso XIII'']] and [[Spanish battleship Jaime I|''Jaime I'']], the three battleships formed the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. Spain remained neutral after the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, so ''España'' and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid the war.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, pp. 357&amp;ndash;376&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1915, ''España'' crossed the Atlantic to represent Spain at the opening ceremonies for the [[Panama Canal]]. Since the major European navies were occupied with World War I, only Spain and Portugal sent ships to the ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Our Navy'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 ''España'' carried the Spanish representative to the [[quatercentenary]] of the discovery of the [[Straits of Magellan]] in [[Chile]], in the process becoming the Spanish Navy's first ship to pass through the Panama Canal. On 29 January 1921 she ran aground in Chilean waters off [[Puerto Montt]] on her return to Spain, though she was refloated with some difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández et al., p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Her hull was dented badly for a length of {{convert|150|ft|abbr=on}}, and the rocks tore a large hole that was approximately {{convert|8|by|8|ft|abbr=on}} between frames 22 and 36, and several smaller holes between frames 48 to 56 on the port side and 58 to 76 on the starboard side.&lt;ref&gt;''The Panama Canal Record'', p. 625&lt;/ref&gt; Divers effected temporary repairs with concrete in Chile, followed by permanent repairs that were made in [[Balboa, Panama]] before she made her return voyage across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;''The Panama Canal Record'', p. 569&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, she was assigned to the Training Squadron, along with her two sister ships.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the early 1920s, she provided fire support to the [[Spanish Army]] in its campaigns in Morocco during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]]. While conducting a bombardment off [[Cape Tres Forcas]] near [[Melilla]] on 26 August 1923, she ran hard aground.&lt;ref name=Fe106/&gt;

The Spanish Navy hired two salvage companies to refloat the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as much weight as possible from ''España'' in an attempt to lighten her to permit refloating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard to be picked up later by the salvage vessel ''Kanguro''. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to lighten her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy.&lt;ref name=Fe106&gt;Fernández et al., p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; The 305&amp;nbsp;mm and 102&amp;nbsp;mm guns recovered from ''España'' were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service.&lt;ref name=Fe106/&gt; After the overthrow of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]], his namesake ship ''Alfonso XIII'', was renamed ''España'' in April 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimons, p. 857&lt;/ref&gt;
