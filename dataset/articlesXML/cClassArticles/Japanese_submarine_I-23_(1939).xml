'''''I-23''''' was a [[Type B1 submarine]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]]. After a raid on the West Coast of [[California]] she participated in an attempt at a second attack upon [[Pearl Harbor]]. After surviving an American air attack on  [[Kwajalein]] ''I-23'' was lost in early 1942 with all hands somewhere off the [[Oahu]] coast of [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter&quot;&gt;Carpenter, Dorr ''Submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy'' ISBN 0-87021-682-1 p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service History==
The submarine was laid down at the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] on 8 December 1938, as Submarine No. 41. She was launched on 24 November 1939 with [[Shibata Genichi]] as Chief Equipping Officer, and Commander Shibata as Commanding Officer. She was then assigned to Rear Admiral [[Sato Tsutomu]]'s ''SubRon 1'' Division, along with {{ship|Japanese submarine|I-21||2}} and {{ship|Japanese submarine|I-22||2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;combinedfleet&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

===Attack on a Lexington-class aircraft carrier===
On 9 December 1941 ''I-6'' reported sighting a {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier}}, as well as two [[cruiser]]s, off [[Oahu]]. Vice Admiral Shimizu in {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Katori||2}} ordered all of SubRon 1's boats, except the [[Special Attack Force]], to pursue and sink the carrier. By the next day, while proceeding surfaced, ''I-23''{{'}}s lookouts reported sighting an American patrol plane. While crash diving, ''I-23'' accidentally descended to the depth of {{convert|120|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;combinedfleet&quot;/&gt;

===Attack on the West Coast===
On 11 December 1941 ''I-23'' was redirected to the West Coast of the United States to raid American shipping in the [[Monterey Bay]] area, arriving within 100 miles of its destination on 18 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;combinedfleet&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;20 miles off [[Cypress Point]], [[Monterey Peninsula]], California. After 1415, ''I-23'' battle-surfaced on the [[Richfield Oil Company]]'s 6,771-ton tanker [[SS Agwiworld]] at 37N, 122W, firing a total of 14 shells, but missed the zigzagging target in rough seas. The ''Agwiworld'' then escaped to safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;combinedfleet&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 22 December ''I-23'' departed from the West Coast for the [[Palmyra Island]] area.

===Second attack on Pearl Harbor===
In January, 1942, the IJN General Staff began to develop a plan to raid Pearl Harbor a second time. The objective of the attack was to disrupt ship repair activities.

&lt;blockquote&gt;At Kwajalein, five submarines were selected to participate in [[Operation K-1]], the planned second air attack on Pearl Harbor. The objective of the attack was to bomb the ''Ten-Ten Dock'' and disrupt ship repair activities. The plan called for the airplanes to depart from the [[Marshall Islands]] and fly to [[French Frigate Shoal]] in the Hawaiian Islands (500 miles WNW of Pearl Harbor) where they were to be refueled by I-class submarines.&lt;ref name=&quot;combinedfleet&quot;/&gt; ''I-9'' was assigned to take up station midway between Wotje and the Shoal and act as a radio beacon for two Kawanishi H8K1 &quot;Emily&quot; flying boat bombers. ''I-19'', ''I-15'' and ''I-26'' were to refuel the flying boats at the Shoal. ''I-23'' was then to standby 10 miles south of [[Pearl Harbor]], providing weather reports and acting in an air-sea rescue capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;combinedfleet&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As part of the mission, after sundown on 1 January, ''I-23'' attempted to conduct periscope reconnaissance off [[Palmyra Island]], but came under gunfire. Cdr Shibata decided to withdraw the ''I-23'' and make another try next evening. On 3 January the ''I-23'' arrived at the Hawaiian islands, two days later departing for [[Kwajalein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;combinedfleet&quot;/&gt;

===American air raid on Kwajalein===
On 1 February 1942 Vice Admiral [[William F. Halsey Jr.]]'s [[Task Force 8]], which include the aircraft carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, began an air raid on Kwajalein and Wotje in the Marshall Islands. ''Enterprise''{{'}}s airplanes sank a transport and damaged a light cruiser, ''Katori'', flagship of the [[Sixth Sensuikan Fleet]]. The submarine depot ship, ''[[Yasukuni Maru]]'', and several other important ships were also damaged during the raid.&lt;ref name=&quot;combinedfleet&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; At the time, ''I-23'' was taking on supplies while anchored between tender, the ''Yasukuni Maru'', and ''I-26''. She returned fire while attempting to dump her deck cargo into the sea. After the ''Yasukuni Maru'' received a bomb hit, one of her 25-mm AA gunners was injured by bomb fragments. Her floatplane ''avgas'' tank ignited, causing a small fire. By the time the Dauntlesses of VS-6 and VB-6 arrived, all of the submarines had submerged. After the attack ''I-23'' briefly participated in an unsuccessful pursuit and hunt of Halsey's ''Task Force,'' but later returned.&lt;ref name=&quot;combinedfleet&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Loss of ''I-23''===
On 24 February 1942, at 23:30 ''I-23'' transmitted her last report from the Hawaii area. Presumed lost with all of her ninety-six sailors somewhere off the Oahu coast of Hawaii, including the Combined Fleet staff officer LtCdr [[Konishi Masayoshi]], she was removed from the [[Navy List]] on 30 April 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyd&quot;&gt;Boyd, Carl ''The Japanese Submarine Force and World War II'' ISBN 1557500800 p.210&lt;/ref&gt;
