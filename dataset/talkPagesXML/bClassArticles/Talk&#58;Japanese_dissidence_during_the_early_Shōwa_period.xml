==Take out Uchiyama Kanzo==

http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/21814/KATO-DISSERTATION-2013.pdf?sequence=1 showcases [[Uchiyama Kanzo]] showcasing his disdain for the military. But on Beyond Brushtalk: Sino-Japanese Literary Exchange in the Interwar Period By Christopher T. Keaveney Page 41 When confronted with anti-Japanese reactions to Japanese imperialism in China in the 1920s and 1930s, Uchiyama all too often tended to regard the events as a nuisance that upset the balance of life in Shanghai rather than to condemn the Japanese aggression which gave rise to those circumstances. This passiveness, and Considering Beyond Brushtalk is a published work, it had to be evaluated by experts before it got published. That's why Uchiyama should be taken out. But should be put on the &quot;see also&quot; section due to his connections to revolutionaries such as [[Lu Xun]] and [[Kaji Wataru]]([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 17:40, 5 February 2014 (UTC))

==I will be taking out Uchiyama Kanzo  for the reasons above==

I will be taking out Uchiyama Kanzo from the list of Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan for the reasons above. If you are against my idea. Here is the portion I deleted so you can return it back to the list. 

=== Kanzo Uchiyama and the Uchiyama Bookstore===

[[Kanzo Uchiyama]] was a Japanese Christian pacifist, and the owner of the Uchiyama Bookstore in Shanghai, which became a haven for Chinese, and Japanese left wing intellectuals, such as [[Lu Xun]], and [[Kaji Wataru]], who was a political refugee from Japan, before the war.&lt;ref&gt;Beyond Brushtalk: Sino-Japanese Literary Exchange in the Interwar PeriodBy Christopher T. Keaveney Page 158&lt;/ref&gt; Uchiyama felt that his vocation as cultural ambassador transcended political ideology. Wishing to bring both Chinese, and Japanese together, but it became harder through the 1930s, and 1940s and soon impossible.&lt;ref&gt; Beyond Brushtalk: Sino-Japanese Literary Exchange in the Interwar Period By Christopher T. Keaveney Page 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Miki, died in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://mesharpe.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,4,6;journal,62,159;linkingpublicationresults,1:110905,1&lt;/ref&gt; The bookstore was closed down the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bekkoame.ne.jp/~gensei/ten/erojin.html |title=Lu Xun |publisher=Bekkoame.ne.jp |date=1936-10-18 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A statue of Uchiyama is in Shanghai, and him, and his wife Miki were both buried across Sun Yat-sen's wife, [[Soong Ching Ling]], at Wanguo Cemetery in Shanghai.

==Rearranging Resistance before the rise of militarism==

Considering the attempted assassination of Hirohito by Daisuke Namba happened first, and the attempted assassination by Fumiko happened later. I put Daisuke first.([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 20:02, 5 February 2014 (UTC))

==I replaced a source on Japanese resistance during WWIi==

I took out &quot;There were also Japanese political exiles, and disillusioned Japanese Imperial soldiers working with Chinese resistance during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. &lt;ref&gt;Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War IIBy John W. Dower Page 221&lt;/ref&gt;&quot; 

because http://www.hawaii.edu/uhwo/clear/HonoluluRecord/kojisblog/03_20_52.html, which concerns Kaji Wataru, and http://www.hawaii.edu/uhwo/clear/HonoluluRecord/kojisblog/04_17_52.html, which concerns Sanzo Nosaka, give more clearer sources, but if there is a problem, the old portion I deleted is here on the talk page. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 01:18, 6 February 2014 (UTC))

==I took out a portion==

Concerning Kaji and his wife Yuki were also part of a diaspora of Japanese antiwar writers who lived in China, and were involved with Chinese literary circles.&lt;ref&gt;Sino-Japanese Transculturation: Late Nineteenth Century to the End of the ... edited by Richard King, Cody Poulton, Katsuhiko Endo Page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Alot of them congregating at [[Kanzo Uchiyama|Kanzo Uchiyama's]] bookstore.&lt;ref&gt;Beyond Brushtalk: Sino-Japanese Literary Exchange in the Interwar Period By Christopher T.

Keaveney Page 43&lt;/ref&gt; Because there from different sources, and I think i'm jumping to conclusion when I say all the anti-war writers of japanese descent visited the bookstore. If there is a problem, the portion i taken out is here.

==I'm think of putting Japanese expatriates in one section==

I'll have to dissolve journalists who worked for WWII. I can seperate the journalist Ozaki Hotsumi in a Sorge Spy ring category, and also Shinozaki Mamoru in his own category. If there is any object let me know.  ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 14:03, 9 February 2014 (UTC)).

== Mamoru Shinozaki I deleted his portion, but put him on the see also section==

[[Mamoru Shinozaki]] was a Japanese attache to the [[Dōmei Tsushin]] News Agency, and a spy for Imperial Japan. Horrified by the actions of the Japanese during the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]], he saved many from the [[Sook Ching massacre]] by illicitly issuing &quot;good citizens passes&quot; to Chinese, and Eurasian citizens. He was roped in to help the British Field Security Force and during the War Crimes Trials as interpreter and prosecution witness following the Japanese Surrender of Singapore due to the praise of the people he saved.&lt;ref&gt;Singapore at Random By Audrey Perera My Dearest Enemy Page 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shaun O'dwyer |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2012/12/03/commentary/tell-the-stories-of-those-who-refused/#.Uu1bbbTwXIU |title=Tell the stories of those who refused |publisher=The Japan Times |date= |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance of &quot;Resistance in 20th Century Japan&quot; section==
Is this section actually relevant in an article about resistance during World War II? It makes no mention of how events earlier in the century related to events occurring during the war.

:Perhaps this article could be renamed ''Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan in the 20th century'' and have its scope expanded accordingly.  I feel that the subject matter is artificially hamstrung if it can't discuss pre-war events and developments in detail.  Either that, or split off part of the current article into a ''Pre-war Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan'' article and have the WW II specific material refer to that article as needed. &amp;mdash; [[User:Myasuda|Myasuda]] ([[User talk:Myasuda|talk]]) 15:01, 15 February 2014 (UTC)

==Changing the name of Japanese resistance groups to Japanese defectors==

In order to focus on the defectors, such as spies, and soldiers, and there reasons for joining. Could be a better highlight, and considering I have the the stories of the defectors already on the section.

==Proposal to Change Article name to &quot;Japanese Resistance during the Shōwa period&quot;==

Considering that the ultranationalists resistance was still pro-Empire of Japan, and just because some resisters opposed the government doesn't mean they opposed the Empire of Japan. The Showa Period lasted from December 25, 1926, through January 7, 1989 so the article will still cover resistance in the pre-war era. It can cover from Hirohito's reign, to him denying his title as a god in his [[Humanity Declaration]].([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 01:25, 20 May 2014 (UTC)).

The Article also states that &quot;This section contains information of unclear or questionable importance or relevance to the article's subject matter. Please help improve this article by clarifying or removing superfluous information. (February 2014)&quot; Changing the article name could fix that. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 01:41, 20 May 2014 (UTC)).

If the &quot;Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan during the Shōwa period&quot; Might as well change the title to &quot;Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan during the Shōwa period.&quot;([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 05:12, 20 May 2014 (UTC)).

Or &quot;Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan during World War II&quot; Not everyone knows what the Showa Period was.([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 05:15, 20 May 2014 (UTC)).

:The article does not cover only the period of World War II, and it was you yourself that (rightly) moved it from the earlier title of &quot;in World War II&quot;.

:Resistance against what/who? The title is incomplete. The resistance was against the governing militarist faction so &quot;Anti-militarist resistance in Japan during the Showa period&quot; is succinct and complete. [[User:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67)]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 19:03, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

Just because of the arrest of Major Tsunoda Tomoshige, doesn't mean Tsunoda was anti-militarist. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 02:34, 21 May 2014 (UTC)).

if Ultrarightist resistance, which is militarist, is kept, the article names is justified. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 06:48, 21 May 2014 (UTC)).

==Is the Ultranationalist resistance appropriate for this article?==

Is the Ultranationalist resistance appropriate for this article?

Ultranationalist resistance seems to parallel to [[Kyūjō Incident]], and the Nazi [[Werwolf]] resistance. Not the [[German Resistance to Nazism]] ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 02:30, 21 May 2014 (UTC)).

==Proposal to Change &quot;Resistance to Japanese nationalism in modern-day Japan&quot; to &quot;Resistance to Japanese nationalism in the Modern Showa Era==

Since the article focuses on the the Showa Era. Yasuhiro's visit to Yasukuni, which can be discussed as revitalizing of Japanese nationalism , and Saburo's lawsuits all happened during the Showa Era. Can also keep the Japanese leftists attitudes towards Japanese war crimes. Probably going to have to delete

Calder Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, an open letter addressed to &quot;Mutsuhito, Emperor of Japan from Anarchist-Terrorists&quot; was posted at the Consulate General of Japan in San Francisco. Mutsuhito was the personal name of Hirohito's grandfather [[Emperor Meiji]]. The letter denied the Emperor's divinity, and concluded &quot;Hey you, miserable Mutsuhito. Bombs are all around you, about to explode. Farewell to you.&quot; The incident changed the attitude towards leftist movements, leading to the government to put socialists, anarchists, and communists under surveillance.

The consul general in San Francisco reported that the anarchist movement began under the influence of [[Shūsui Kōtoku]] in San Francisco. Kotoku arrived in America in November 1905. He had been imprisoned in Japan for five months for violating press ordinances in articles written for Heimin Shimbun (Commoners' Newspaper),&lt;ref&gt;The Japanese Conspiracy: The Oahu Sugar Strike of 1920 By Masayo Umezawa Duus Page 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in America, he came under the influence of anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;Pacifism in Japan: The Christian and Socialist Tradition By Edited by Nobuya Bamba and John F. Howes Page 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, Kotoku was executed along with 11 others for their involvement with the [[High Treason Incident]], a conspiracy to assassinate Emperor Meiji. In response to the High Treason Incident, the [[Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu]] (Special Higher Police) was established.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Japan: From Stone Age to Superpower By Kenneth Henshall Page 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saved Japanese Communist Party USA members==
[[Issei]] (Japanese immigrant) communists opposed the Japanese state. During the [[Depression era]], there were nearly 200 Japanese-American members of the [[Communist Party USA]], which had become a refuge for foreign exiles.  One of the first issei communists to be deported from America was Kenmotsu Sadaichi.

===Saved Japanese militarism===
The [[May 15 Incident]] of 1932 was a failed coup led by nationalist dissidents in the Japanese military, and citizenry. The coup resulted in the death of Prime Minister [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]], who had demanded budget cuts to the military. The conspirators proclaimed their loyalty to the emperor. They received widespread acclaim in Japan, and were given light sentences. The incident was the beginning of [[government by assassination]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Rising Sun, Falling Skies: The Disastrous Java Sea Campaign of World War II By Jeffrey Cox Page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[February 26 Incident]] of 1936 was another failed nationalist coup. Following the coup's failure, the role of the mainstream military leadership in the government increased as civilian officials depended more on the army to maintain stability. Despite Hirohito labeling the rebels as traitors,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;Modern Japan: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Nationalism edited by H Orth Hirt Professor of History Emeritus James L Huffman, James L.

*'''Oppose''': &quot;Resistance&quot; is the most common term used to describe anti-governmental (whether opposing legitimate or occupation government) actions during WWII, particularly in Axis and Axis occupied countries. The WWII navbox template ([[Template:World War II]]) used in this article uses the term &quot;resistance&quot;. So do most articles on national resistance movements linked in that template, including the main article [[Resistance during World War II]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop ]] ([[User talk:Finnusertop|talk]]) 00:22, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
::So? This article isn't about World War II. Notice that our article on the German case is titled [[German Resistance to Nazism]]. How does an uninformed reader know that the Japanese resistance referred to in the title is towards the Japanese government and not to, say, invaders or conquerors? It is weird to assume that &quot;resistance&quot; implies resistance to ''internal'' and ''legal'' threats rather than external ones. [[User:Srnec|Srnec]] ([[User talk:Srnec|talk]]) 00:52, 13 July 2014 (UTC)

In that case, the article should be renamed '''Japanese resistance to the Shōwa government'''.([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 10:34, 14 July 2014 (UTC)).

'''Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan (1926-1945)''' would be better. It's more detailed. The dates correspond with the start of Emperor Hirohito's (Emperor Showa) reign, to his reign at the end of WWII.([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 12:45, 14 July 2014 (UTC)).

Not everyone knows what the Shōwa period is or means, or that the Showa Emperor was another name for Emperor Hirohito.([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 12:49, 14 July 2014 (UTC)).

New title '''Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan (1926–1945)''' indicates who the Japanese rebels were resisting. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 14:18, 14 July 2014 (UTC)). 
::Hm,... &quot;Japanese resistance to Japan&quot; strikes one as redundantly confusing, or confusingly redundant. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Victor_falk|''walk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[user:victor falk|''victor falk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[user_talk:victor falk|''talk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:52, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support''' Clearly a superior title from many aspects. It is simultaneously more [[wp:precise]] while permitting a broader scope. Resistance is a form of opposition, but not all opposition is resistance. &quot;Dissidence&quot; describes best the topic of this article. Also, parenthetical disambiguators should be avoided per [[wp:naturaldis]]. Finally, the format {{xt|&quot;19XX-19YY&quot;}} leaves the door open to arbitrariness and potential disputes, because they are different equally (in)valid &lt;s&gt;candi-dates&lt;/s&gt; canditate dates. Case in point: at the time of this writing, it is &quot;1937&quot;. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Victor_falk|''walk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[user:victor falk|''victor falk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[user_talk:victor falk|''talk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:52, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

'''Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan (1937–1945)''' is now the article of the wiki article. It covers the wartime rule of Emperor Hirohito. The date in the article marks the date of Japan's invasion of China on 1937. The title of the article can be compared to the title of the article of '''[[German Resistance to Nazism]]'''([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 01:51, 15 July 2014 (UTC)).
:*Why does the scope have to be restricted to opposition after the start of the Second Sino-Chinese War (and also the Japan(ese) redundancy is contrary to [[WP:CONCISE]] and might be confusing as I pointed out above)? That's just as arbitrary and unhelpful to readers as  [[German Resistance to Nazism (1939-1945)]]. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Victor_falk|''walk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[user:victor falk|''victor falk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[user_talk:victor falk|''talk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:22, 15 July 2014 (UTC)

The Second Sino-Japanese war is considered by some, such as the Japanese, and Chinese, to be the beginning of World War II. The Second Sino-Japanese war would merge with WWII. Since the article is about resistance during WWII, the new title seems appropriate. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 18:41, 15 July 2014 (UTC)). 

The article is also a part of the WWII template. Another reason why the article title is appropriate.([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 18:44, 15 July 2014 (UTC)).

Japanese resisting the Empire of Japan does not mean the resisters were resisting the Japanese people. Japanese who resisted the Empire of Japan were resisting the Empire, its government, police, laws, state shinto, royal family, etc. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 18:57, 15 July 2014 (UTC)).

The article name has been changed to ''Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan (1921–1945)''. 1921 was when Hirohito ascended to the title of Prince regent, which gave him power over the  monarchy without being the monarch. Its an important date because it was when he was targeted for assassination by rebels. The peace preservation law, which limited freedom of speech in japan was passed. Anarchist leader Osugi was murdered during hirohito's regency. Resistance was active before he ruled as emperor. The title change is justified. I apologize for not having it discussed thru the talk page. If their are any problems, get an administrator to change the title back article's original title ''Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan (1937-1945)'' ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 12:04, 16 July 2014 (UTC)).

'''To Victor Falk''' Considering the article title's vagueness. would the new title &quot;''Japanese resistance to Hirohito''&quot; be more fitting. Japanese dissidents had no problem with violating the peace preservation law, which forbade any opposition to the [[kokutai]] (Kyūjitai: 國體, Shinjitai: 国体, literally &quot;national body/structure&quot;)  translatable as &quot;system of government&quot;, &quot;sovereignty&quot;, &quot;national identity; national essence; national character&quot;, &quot;national polity; body politic; national entity; basis for the Emperor's sovereignty; Japanese constitution&quot;. The article also encompasses his reign as Regent in 1921, to the end of world war ii in 1945.([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 12:40, 16 July 2014 (UTC)).

The intro of the article if it becomes &quot;Japanese resistance to Hirohito&quot; would mention that the article is about Japanese who resisted Hirohito's rule. Since rebelling against the Peace preservation law is rebelling against the [[Kokutai]]. Or the intro can mention it's about Japanese resistance to the government of Hirohito.([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 12:47, 16 July 2014 (UTC)).

Or &quot;Japanese Resistance&quot; can be the new article name. It would be like the [[French Resistance]] article's title. The intro of the article would suffice to avoid any vagueness. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 12:44, 16 July 2014 (UTC)).

*'''Support''' originally proposed move to [[Japanese dissidence during the Shōwa period]]. The article has been unilaterally moved numerous times by one editor, turning the whole discussion into a farce, but the current title ''still'' does not address the original concerns that the title does not indicate what the resistance was against. --[[User:DAJF|DAJF]] ([[User talk:DAJF|talk]]) 23:26, 17 July 2014 (UTC)

===Discussion===
:''Any additional comments:''

The article appears to have been moved unilaterally to &quot;Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan (1937–1945)&quot;, but since large portions of the text still dwell on the pre-1937 and post-1945 periods, isn't the period (1937-1945) specified unnecessarily narrow? --[[User:DAJF|DAJF]] ([[User talk:DAJF|talk]]) 04:47, 16 July 2014 (UTC)

That's why the new title is '''&quot;Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan (1921–1945)&quot;''', which encompasses Hirohito's reign as regent, to the end of wwii. Some people on the talk page are saying the article title is vague. The title could renamed '''Japanese resistance to Hirohito''' Japanese dissidents had no problem with violating the peace preservation law, which forbade any opposition to the kokutai (Kyūjitai: 國體, Shinjitai: 国体, literally &quot;national body/structure&quot;) translatable as &quot;system of government&quot;, &quot;sovereignty&quot;, &quot;national identity; national essence; national character&quot;, &quot;national polity; body politic; national entity; basis for the Emperor's sovereignty; Japanese constitution&quot;. The article encompasses his reign as Regent in 1921, to the end of world war ii in 1945. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 13:17, 16 July 2014 (UTC)).

Also, I apologize for changing the title without a vote. I'm still trying to get a response for my new proposed title '''Japanese resistance to Hirohito''' .([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 13:19, 16 July 2014 (UTC)).

{{-}}

If '''&quot;Japanese resistance to Hirohito''' is kept, then the intro will say resistance to the Emperor would be classified as resistance to the Monarchy, the Army, and Navy, which Article 11 of the [[Meiji Constitution]] states the Emperor has Emperor has the supreme command of, or the Ise grand shrine, which honors [[Ameratsu]], the sun goddess that the Emperor is believed to be descended from. Or collaboration with the enemy government, such as their intelligence agencies, armies, which target the Japaense military, could be considered resistance. Such as joining the Office of strategic services. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 16:30, 16 July 2014 (UTC)).

Resistance to Hirohito can be classified as just disrespect to [[Ameratsu]]. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 16:41, 16 July 2014 (UTC)).

Intro for proposed article name. '''Japanese resistance to Hirohito''' was resistance by Japanese citizens to [[Hirohito]], which encompasses his ascension to [[Prince regent]] on November 29, 1921 to the [[Surrender of the Empire of Japan]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on September 2, 1945. Resistance to Hirohito applies to actions that oppose, or endanger the Monarchy, the Army, or Navy, which under Article 11 of the [[Meiji Constitution]] states that the Emperor acts as Supreme commander of, or showing a lack of reverance to the Sun Goddess Ameratsu, who is tied to the Emperor myth. Collaborating with enemy nations during wartime can also be considered resistance as such actions endangers the Japanese military. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 16:59, 16 July 2014 (UTC)).

Change title to '''&quot;Treason in the Empire of Japan (1921-1945)'''. from '''The Real History of World War II: A New Look at the Past  By Alan Axelrod Page 138''' explains that the Emperor had extensive executive, legislative, and military power, but his authority was far from absolute. Their could have been instances in Japan where one would commit treason without directly, or indirectly resisting Hirohito. Much of the resistance would have been persecuted by Laws passed by the Diet. Such as the peace preservation law. The tokko thought police was controlled by the home ministry. The title should be changed to avoid confusion.([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 18:19, 17 July 2014 (UTC)).

==Information needed on mahito akashi and junzo akashi==

Mahito akashi was the father of Junzo Akashi. Junzo was a member of the todaisha ([[Watch Tower Society]]). They were both religious dissidents. Mahito resisted the draft. These dissidents should be in the article, but their should be more information to back up their stories.

==Title is still not specific enough. Article title should be changed==

The article focuses on Japanese dissidents that are non-militarists and non-ultranationalists. The [[May 15 Incident]] and the [[February 26 Incident]] are both ultranationalist coups. Dissidents who are mentioned in the article, such as [[Nosaka Sanzo]], are the focus of the article. There should be a title change that is more specific to the article's focus.

== This article is one of the top ten most edited articles on Wikipedia for 2014 ==

According to [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/12/30/top-10-most-edited-pages-in-2014/ this Wikimedia post], this page is one of the most edited of the year---in fact, with 8,212 edits, it's number three, ranking above [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]] and [[Shooting of Michael Brown]], for instance. All of the rest of the entries (with a similar exception: [[List of works by Eugène Guillaume]]) are articles on current events, which naturally are always the most heavily edited articles on Wikipedia. What amazes me most is that this accolade is the result of the world of ''one'' editor, [[User:Greg723|Greg723]], who it seems has since creating the article on January 14 (is there more perfect timing?) has over the past year run a human version of the hamster treadmill, writing and rewriting the article in series of small edits, cycling it back and forth between 9 and 13k in size. I'm not sure whether or not that was the intention all along, Greg723, or whether you're just crazy...a New Year to all, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana,Arial,Helvetica&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#333&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;[[User:Resident Mario|Res]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#444&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Resident_Mario#top|Mar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 01:02, 1 January 2015 (UTC)

== Dissidence or dissidents? ==

In the latest move the edit summary indicates that the primary objective was to add &quot;Imperial&quot; into the title, however another change was done without comment or explanation. The article is not simply about dissidents (people), much of the content is about the dissident activities and organizations involved in dissidence (action). [[User:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67)]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 21:08, 20 January 2015 (UTC)

:[[Imperial Japanese dissidents in the Shōwa period]] is an appropriate title due to what it discusses. The article is similar to articles such as [[Soviet dissidents]], and the [[Cuban dissident movement]]. All three of these articles focus on dissidents, as well as dissident activities. ([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 10:18, 21 January 2015 (UTC)).

::That's just an [[WP:OTHERSTUFF]] argument, so not convincing at all. If this page was basically just a list of dissidents (people) I would agree, but it actually discusses the activities, organizations and context in significant detail, hence my preference for &quot;dissidence&quot; - which (minus the &quot;imperial&quot;) was the title for a fairly long time. [[User:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67)]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 10:42, 21 January 2015 (UTC)
:::I also object to the recent page move.  A casual reader could be left wondering whether the word &quot;Imperial&quot; refers to Japan or to the dissidents.  If it is necessary to refer to &quot;Imperial Japan&quot;, a better name might be &quot;Dissidents of Imperial Japan in the Shōwa period&quot;. &amp;mdash; [[User:Myasuda|Myasuda]] ([[User talk:Myasuda|talk]]) 14:15, 21 January 2015 (UTC)

:I have boldly reverted the undiscussed move, as it did not appear at all well thought-out. Any future moves should be formally requested at [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]] to allow discussion and gain consensus. --[[User:DAJF|DAJF]] ([[User talk:DAJF|talk]]) 14:46, 21 January 2015 (UTC)

We should stick to the older article name &quot;Japanese dissidence during the Showa Period&quot;. It already has been an established article name for a fairly long time, and also because it is well thought-out than &quot;Imperial Japanese dissidents in the Showa Period&quot;. However, the intro should at least be clear that the article focuses on figures, and events before the dissolution of the Empire of Japan following the end of WWII because the Showa period consists of the post-war period as well. That has always been the topic of the article since its inception. That is really the only issue I have with the article.([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 14:54, 21 January 2015 (UTC)).

==Merging Japanese Resistance to the Imperial House of Japan into Japanese dissidence during the Shōwa period==
Merging [[Japanese Resistance to the Imperial House of Japan]] into [[Japanese dissidence during the Shōwa period]] shouldn't happen because Japanese Resistance to the Imperial House of Japan covers Japanese resistance to the Imperial House of Japan throughout its history. The Imperial House of Japan was founded before the [[Showa Period]].([[User:Greg723|Greg723]] ([[User talk:Greg723|talk]]) 22:56, 3 June 2015 (UTC)).</text>
