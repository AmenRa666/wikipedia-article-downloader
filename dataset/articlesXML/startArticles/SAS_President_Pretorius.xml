'''SAS ''President Pretorius''''' was the last of three [[Rothesay class frigate|President-class]] [[Type 12 frigate]]s built in the UK for the [[South African Navy]] during the 1960s. The ship spent most of her career training and visited foreign ports in Africa and [[Australia]]. She had a lengthy modernisation during the 1970s and manpower shortages limited her activities after that was completed in 1977. ''President Pretorius'' was [[paid off]] in 1985 and was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1992.

== Description ==
The President-class ships displaced {{convert|2170|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard load]] and {{convert|2605|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. They had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|370|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|41|ft|m|1}} and a mean deep [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|17|ft|6|in|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=DuToit/&gt;{{rp|238}} The ships were powered by a pair of [[English Electric]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]], using steam provided by two [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler]]s. The turbines developed a total of {{convert|30000|shp|lk=in}} which gave a maximum speed of {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marriott |first=Leo |date=1983 |title=Royal Navy Frigates 1945-1983|location=Shepperton, Surrey, UK |publisher=Ian Allan |isbn=0-7110-1322-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64}} They carried {{convert|309|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave them a range of {{convert|4500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. Their crew numbered 14 officers and 200 [[naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=DuToit/&gt;{{rp|238}}

The Presidents were armed with one twin-gun mount for [[QF 4.5 inch Mk I – V naval gun|QF 4.5-inch (114&amp;nbsp;mm) Mk V]] [[dual-purpose gun]]s forward and one twin mount for [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{convert|40|mm|1|adj=on}} Bofors]] [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft guns]]. For [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine work]], the ships were fitted with Type 162, 170, and 177M [[sonar]]s for the pair of triple-barrelled [[Limbo (weapon)|Mk 10 Limbo]] [[anti-submarine mortar]]s. They were equipped with a Type 293Q surface-search [[radar]], [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 262|Type 262]] and 275 gunnery radars, Type 277Q [[Height finder|height-finding radar]] and a Type 978 navigation radar.&lt;ref name=DuToit/&gt;{{rp|220–22, 238}}

By the mid-1960s, it was obvious that the sonars of the President class were capable of detecting submarines well outside the range of the Limbo anti-submarine mortars and the South Africans decided to follow the lead of the [[Royal Navy]] in giving them the ability to operate [[helicopter]]s that could carry anti-submarine [[torpedo]]es or [[depth charge]]s to a considerable distance from the ships. Therefore, the forward Limbo mortar was removed and its space was plated over to form a small [[flight deck]]. The Bofors mount, its [[director (military)|director]] and the aft superstructure was replaced by a [[hangar]] for a [[Westland Wasp]] helicopter. Two single Bofors guns were positioned on the hangar roof and provisions were made for four [[M2 Browning|{{convert|0.5|in|mm|1|adj=on}} Browning machine guns]]. A pair of American [[Mark 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes|{{convert|12.75|in|mm|0|adj=on}} Mk 32 triple-barrelled anti-submarine torpedo tubes]] were added amidships and their electronics were upgraded, including the addition of a [[Thomson-CSF]] Jupiter [[early-warning radar]] atop a new [[mainmast]] and a [[Selenia]] Orion [[Ship gun fire-control system|fire-control system]]. In addition, ''President Pretorius'' was converted to use [[diesel fuel]] and some of her water [[ballast tank]]s were converted into fuel tanks.&lt;ref name=DuToit/&gt;{{rp|227}}

==History==
Three President-class frigates were ordered by the South African Navy in the late 1950s following the [[Simonstown Agreement]] with the Royal Navy. ''President Pretorius'', named after the first President of the [[South African Republic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DuToit&quot;/&gt;{{rp|220, 223}} was the last of the three [[sister ship]]s and was ordered from [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]] on 29 July 1959. The ship was [[laid down]] at their [[shipyard]] in [[Scotstoun]], [[Glasgow]] on 21 November 1960&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Chris|title=Three Frigates: The South African Navy Comes of Age|date=2006|publisher=Just Done Productions|location=Durban, South Africa|authorlink=Chris Bennett (admiral)|isbn=1-920169-02-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} and was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 28 September 1962 by Mrs. Mientjie Grobelaar, wife of General [[Pieter Grobbelaar]]. She was commissioned on 18 March 1964 with [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[James Johnson (SA Navy)|James Johnson]], later [[List of South African military chiefs#Chief of the Navy|Chief of the Navy]], in command.&lt;ref name=&quot;DuToit&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Du Toit|first1=Allan|authorlink=Allan du Toit|title=South Africa's Fighting Ships: Past and Present|date=1992|publisher=Ashanti Publishing|location=Rivonia, South Africa|isbn=1-874800-50-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}}

''President Pretorius'' was escorted into [[Cape Town]] by her two [[sister ship]]s, {{SAS|President Kruger|F150|2}}, {{SAS|President Steyn|F147|2}}, the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Whelp (R37)|''Simon von der Stel'']] and four smaller warships to be greeted by the Chief of Naval Staff, [[Rear Admiral]] [[Hugo Biermann]], on 26 September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett&quot;/&gt;{{rp|57–58}} After 1964, the British government was reluctant to be seen openly cooperating with the [[apartheid]] government of South Africa and limited itself to exercises as their ships passed by. In September 1967, the 10th Frigate Flotilla, consisting of ''President Pretorius'', ''President Kruger'', and the newly commissioned [[replenishment oiler]] {{SAS|Tafelberg||2}}, participated in one such exercise with the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Eagle|R05|2}}, the frigate {{HMS|Loch Fada|K390|2}} and the submarine {{HMS|Ambush|P418|2}}. The [[flotilla (naval)|flotilla]] departed Simon's Town on 7 October 1968 for Australia and arrived in [[Freemantle]] on the 23rd. They continued onwards to [[Sydney]] and then participated in the [[Remembrance Day]] ceremony in [[Melbourne]] on 11 November. The ships departed three days later, bound for home, but they were forced to put into Freemantle when a pump in ''President Pretorius'' burnt out en route. They finally reached home on 3 December. A year later, a squadron consisting of ''Simon von der Stel'', ''President Pretorius'', ''Tafelberg'' and two [[minesweeper]]s visited [[Portuguese Angola]].&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;{{rp|117, 120–22}} ''President Kruger'' and ''President Pretorius'' trained with a passing British [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] in July–August 1970.&lt;ref name=DuToit/&gt;{{rp|227}} 

By this time, the navy was experiencing shortages of manpower and the ship [[laid up]] on 1 September to be used as an accommodation ship while ''President Steyn'' was finishing up her modernisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett&quot;/&gt;{{rp|89}} ''President Pretorius'' formally [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 11 May 1971,&lt;ref name=&quot;DuToit&quot;/&gt;{{rp|227}} but languished in reserve for some time before actual work began. The ship did not recommission until 12 July 1977 in marked contrast to the time required to modernise her sisters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett&quot;/&gt;{{rp|89}} She conveyed the remains of the [[Xhosa]] Chief [[Maqoma]] from [[Robben Island]] to [[Ciskei]] in August 1978. Almost three years later, in May 1981, ''President Pretorius'' and ''President Kruger'' participated in the 20th anniversary of the republic's founding and exercised with a squadron from the [[Republic of China]]. Shortly afterwards, the two sisters made a [[wikt:show the flag|showing the flag]] cruise along the East African coast. After the accidental sinking of ''President Kruger'' in 1982 and the earlier laying up of ''President Steyn'', ''President Pretorius'' was the last of the sisters remaining active. She was refitted during the early 1980s to lay [[naval mine|mine]]s and to operate [[assault boat]]s. The ship exercised with another Chinese squadron in mid-1985 before she was decommissioned on 26 July due to manpower shortages and lack of funds. Plans to reactive and modernise ''President Pretorius'' were made later in the 1980s, but shortages of money prevent them from being realized.&lt;ref name=&quot;DuToit&quot;/&gt;{{rp|233–34, 237}} The ship was sold for scrap on 9 December 1992 and subsequently broken up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett&quot;/&gt;{{rp|206}}
