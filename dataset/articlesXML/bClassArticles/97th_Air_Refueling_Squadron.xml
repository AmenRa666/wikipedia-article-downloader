The '''97th Air Refueling Squadron''' is an inactive [[United States Air Force]] unit. It was last assigned to the [[92d Operations Group]] at [[Fairchild Air Force Base]], Washington, where it was inactivated on 30 September 2004.

The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated in January 1941 as the '''20th Reconnaissance Squadron'''.  Seven months after activation, it was renamed the '''97th Bombardment Squadron''' and assigned to the [[47th Bombardment Group]].  It performed [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] patrols off the Pacific coast following the entry of the United States into [[World War II]].  Three months later, it began training for [[light bomber]] operations, and in November 1942 it deployed to the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]].  The squadron engaged in combat in northern Africa, Italy and France until [[V-E Day]], earning two [[Distinguished Unit Citation]]s for its actions there.  The 97th returned to the United States in the summer of 1945 and was inactivated at [[Lake Charles Army Air Field]], Louisiana in March 1946.

The '''97th Air Refueling Squadron''' was one of the Air Force's first [[air refueling]] units, activated in 1949.  It was active continuously until 2004, except for brief interruptions in 1964 and 1992.  The squadron served with [[Boeing KB-29]]s until 1954 at [[Biggs Air Force Base]], Texas, when it upgraded to [[Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker]]s.  In 1957 it moved north to [[Malmstrom Air Force Base]], Montana, where it served until 1964 when the KC-97 was being phased out of the active force inventory.

The squadron was soon activated with [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s at [[Blytheville Air Force Base]], Arkansas.  In 1985, the two squadrons were consolidated there into a single unit.  The consolidated squadron provided crews and aircraft to [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) units in the Pacific during the [[Vietnam War]] and deployed elements that served in [[Desert Storm]].  In 1992, it was inactivated as SAC was closing what had been renamed Eaker Air Force Base.

The squadron was again activated a few months later, returning to Malmstrom as part of [[Air Mobility Command]]'s tanker fleet.  It moved to [[Fairchild Air Force Base]], Washington two years later and continued to support Air Force contingency operations until it was inactivated in 1994.

==History==

===World War II===

The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated as the '''20th Reconnaissance Squadron''' at [[McChord Field]], Washington in January 1941, attached to the [[17th Bombardment Group]], and equipped with [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]]s.  In May, it was attached to the [[47th Bombardment Group]] and was assigned to the 47th group and redesignated the '''97th Bombardment Squadron''' in August.&lt;ref name=97ARSfacts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer97BS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer47BG&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 104-106&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Douglas B-18A assigned to 99th Bomb Squadron.jpg|thumb|left|Douglas B-18A assigned to a reconnaissance squadron]]

After the [[Pearl Harbor Attack]] it was equipped with [[Douglas DB-7 Boston]]s and early-model [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Some or all of the B-24s may have been LB-30s.  Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; to perform [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] patrols along the Pacific coast.   In February 1942, with a Japanese submarine attack unlikely, the squadron moved to [[Will Rogers Field]], Oklahoma, re-equipped with [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] light bombers and trained for overseas deployment.&lt;ref name=Maurer97BS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer47BG/&gt;

[[File:A-20 Boston in flight .75 right.jpg|thumb|left|Douglas A-20 as flown by the squadron in the MTO]]
In November 1942, the 97th deployed to French Morocco as part of [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of French North Africa. The squadron engaged in [[close air support]] and [[air interdiction]] missions during the [[North African Campaign]].  It began operations by flying low-level missions in December, continuing these tactics through May 1943.

In February 1943, the [[Afrika Corps]] broke through American lines at the [[Kasserine Pass]].  Although the unit was undermanned and short of supplies it flew missions on 22 February against advancing enemy [[armor]], helping to blunt the enemy attack.  For this action, the 97th was awarded the [[Distinguished Unit Citation]].&lt;ref name=Maurer47BG/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP9002&gt;AF Pamphlet 900-2, Unit Decorations, Awards and Campaign Participation Credits, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron remained active in combat, but also trained for medium altitude bombing missions in April and May.  In June 1943 it participated in the reduction of the islands of [[Pantelleria]] and [[Lampedusa]].  In July, the unit participated in [[Operation Husky]], the invasion of Sicily, attacking German forces evacuating the island from beaches near [[Messina]] the following month.&lt;ref name=Maurer47BG/&gt;
September 1943 saw the launch of [[Operation Avalanche]], the invasion of Italy.  During Avalanche, the squadron provided support for the [[British Eighth Army]].   It participated in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] and advance toward [[Rome]] until the spring of 1944.  
[[File:Douglas A-26 Invader.JPG|thumb|left|Douglas A-26, which replaced the A-20 in 1945]]

In August and September 1944, the unit provided support for [[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of southern France.

The squadron then returned to Italy, where it attacked German communications and other targets, including tanks, bivouac areas, supply dumps, troop concentrations, roads, bridges, [[airfield]]s and railways.&lt;ref name=Maurer47BG/&gt;

The 97th upgraded to [[Douglas A-26 Invader]]s in early 1945.   In April 1945, the squadron and the rest of the 47th group maintained attacks on enemy transportation in the [[Po (river)|Po River Valley]] for sixty consecutive hours despite bad weather and adverse terrain.  The attacks prevented the orderly withdrawal of German forces from northern Italy.  For this action, the squadron earned a second Distinguished Unit Citation.&lt;ref name=Maurer47BG/&gt;

The squadron returned to the United States in July 1945, and was initially stationed at [[Seymour Johnson Field]], North Carolina.  It moved to [[Lake Charles Army Air Field]] in September, where it trained as a pathfinder unit.&lt;ref name=Maurer97BS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/044/958.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 97 Bombardment Squadron Sep 1945|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit remained active until March 1946, when the 47th group reduced from four to three squadrons.&lt;ref name=Maurer47BG/&gt;

===Air Refueling===

====Propeller-driven tankers====
[[File:Boeing KB-29P (8251886247).jpg|thumb|Boeing KB-29P]]
The '''97th Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated in March 1949 and assigned to the [[97th Bombardment Group]] at [[Biggs Air Force Base]], Texas.  The squadron was initially equipped with the [[Boeing KB-29M Superfortress]].  The KB-29M was equipped with a hose system developed by the British in which the tanker trailed a hose to the receiver and fuel was gravity-fed.  The tanker trailed a &quot;hauling line&quot; which was trapped by the receiver, reeled in and attached to the receiver fuel system.  The system was perilous and the KB-29Ms were retired in a few years.

On 1 September 1950, the squadron was the first to receive the improved KB-29P, which was equipped with a boom and used pumps to deliver the fuel more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Knaack, pp. 490-492&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the squadron remained below strength until 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kc-97-97thars-malmstrom.jpg|thumb|left|KC-97 of the 97th Air Refueling Squadron at Malmstrom AFB]]
The squadron upgraded to [[Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker]]s in 1954.  The unit frequently deployed from Biggs to England, Newfoundland and Labrador, completing its last unit deployment as it was moving to Montana.&lt;ref name=97ARSfacts/&gt;   In the mid-1950s, [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) began to move its KC-97 refueling strength to the northern United States.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Smith, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;   The move to Montana-based the squadron ahead of the faster [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]]s it would refuel, and on their programmed route.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Smith, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the squadron moved to [[Malmstrom Air Force Base]] to fill out the [[4061st Air Refueling Wing]], which had been formed the previous month with the [[407th Air Refueling Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/463/475.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 4061 Air Refueling Wing|date=1 December 1957|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[1958 Lebanon Crisis]], the squadron provided support for the [[92d Bombardment Wing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/463/481.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 4061 Air Refueling Wing Jul-Aug 1958|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1961, the 4061st wing was inactivated and the 97th was assigned to the [[9th Bombardment Wing]] at [[Mountain Home Air Force Base]], although it remained at Malmstrom and was attached to the host 341st Combat Support Group there.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;  It was discontinued in March 1964 as part of the phaseout of KC-97 aircraft from the active duty force.&lt;ref name=97ARSfacts/&gt;

====Jet tankers====
The squadron was redesignated as a heavy unit and organized on 8 October 1964 at [[Blytheville Air Force Base]], Arkansas, where it assumed the mission, personnel and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s of the [[914th Air Refueling Squadron]], which was simultaneously inactivated.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Mueller, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;   The squadron provided air refueling primarily to the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]es of the 97th wing.   One half of the squadron's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute [[alert state|alert]], fully fueled and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/010/802.xml|last1=|first1=|title=Abstract (Unclassified), History of the Strategic Bomber since 1945 (Top Secret, downgraded to Secret)|date=1 April 1975|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its alert commitment, the squadron deployed aircraft and aircrews to support Tanker Task Forces in Europe, the Pacific and Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/055/670.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, Vol. I, History 97 Bombardment Wing Jul-Sep 1983|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   During the [[Vietnam War]], from the mid 1960s, the squadron deployed forces to the Pacific to other units to support [[Operation Arc Light]] and [[Operation Rolling Thunder]]. By mid-1972 all of the squadron's tankers wee operating with other [[Strategic Air Command]] units in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstein, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;   In September 1985, the 97th was consolidated with the '''97th Bombardment Squadron''' into a single unit.    In 1990, the consolidated squadron flew 93 sorties in direct support of [[Desert Shield]] and Desert Storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Force History Index&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/113/590.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, Vol. I, History 97 Bombardment Wing Jul-Dec 1990|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It deployed to the Persian Gulf area, where it supported the [[List of B-52 Units of the United States Air Force#Provisional B-52 units|801st Bombardment Wing (Provisional)]] and the [[List of USAF Provisional Wings assigned to Strategic Air Command#802nd Air Refueling Wing Wing (P) Provisional|802d Air Refueling Wing (Provisional)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/113/595.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, Vol. I, History 97 Bombardment Wing Jan-Jun 1991|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadron remained active until April 1992, when it was inactivated as Eaker Air Force Base was closing.&lt;ref name=97ARSfacts/&gt;

The squadron returned to Malmstrom Air Force Base when it was reactivated in October 1992.  At Malmstrom, it was equipped with the re-engined KC-135R tankers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/112/354.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, Vol. I, History 43 Air Refueling Wing Jun-Dec 1992|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron continued to support deployed Tanker Task Forces throughout the world, including periodic support for the [[List of USAF Provisional Wings assigned to Strategic Air Command#1700th Strategic Wing (P) Provsional|1700th Strategic Wing (Provsional)]] in [[Riyadh]], Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Force History Index&quot;/&gt;   It also participated in [[Operation Restore Hope]] in Somalia. The squadron moved to [[Fairchild Air Force Base]], Washington in July 1994 as [[Air Mobility Command]] reorganized its refueling units.  It remained active there until September 2004.&lt;ref name=97ARSfacts/&gt;
