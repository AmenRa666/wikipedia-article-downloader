==Please source these claims.==

:He was barred from the United States and on departure from New York, his research notes and correspondence mysteriously disappeared. He later discoved in his dossier in the United States a statement that he wanted to join the [[Royal Air Force]] so that he could fly to Poland and defect to the [[Soviet Union]].  

I'm not saying that these things are untrue, only that they need to be sourced.[[User:Grace Note|Grace Note]] 03:56, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

Its in a statement of a student of his, Dr Alan Salmon, contained within a tribute in Insight, published by the University of Liverpool this year. I've put the statement back with a rider.  [[User:MAG1|MAG1]] 13:10, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

:Produce the details of the source here, so that it can be verified. And add a footnote. Until you do, it's out. Please don't reinsert disputed edits without providing source details. [[User:Grace Note|Grace Note]] 00:21, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

::Well I don't know what you thought the above message was about.  All done, please leave it alone now.  It would have been polite to have responded to the last message a bit more temperately.  [[User:MAG1|MAG1]] 20:06, 19 May 2006 (UTC)


==British?==

Could editors wishing to add Rotblat to British foo categories and state that he was British please provide a source stating that he was? [[User:Grace Note|Grace Note]] 00:21, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

:Complete red herring this- Rotblat's handle is a bit of a giveaway.  He naturalised as a British subject in 1946.  Source added (Nobel prize CV).  [[User:MAG1|MAG1]] 20:06, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

he had polish citizenship too! kowalmistrz

This site isn't correct. Józef Rotblat his whole live protested to be called a british man. He always said that he is a Polish with british passport and protested to be called &quot;Joseph&quot;, but Józef
:The cited site is opinion, not fact. Rotblat would never have &quot;protested&quot; at being called any particular name. He was &quot;Joseph&quot; to most, &quot;Józef&quot; to contemporary family, &quot;Josh&quot; to younger family and just &quot;Prof&quot; to colleagues.

I am afraid that it is right.  I am sure that it might be true that he said he was Polish with a British passport, but he was a permanent immigrant to the UK.  He did not use the Polish form of his name (and he could have) after settling in the UK:  as far as I have seen for his publications and his work with Pugwash, he used the anglicised version of the name, and this was the name used when he received his Nobel prize.  I am pretty certain that Roblat was happy with who he was, but not at all any sort of nationalist, and lived pragmatically.  [[User:MAG1|MAG1]] 22:06, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

Although he was an Ashkenazi Jew and not Polish, there is unfortunately no exact evidence of his ethnic affiliation. --[[User:Luka Woititz|L. Woititz]] ([[User talk:Luka Woititz|talk]]) 21:11, 8 February 2011 (UTC)

== Lodz or Warsaw? ==
Every source I see (including bios at the Nobel Prize and Pugwash site) mention Warsaw at his birthplace. IF no other source appears, I'll change it. [[User:Ejrrjs]]  says ''[[User talk:Ejrrjs|What?]]'' 18:09, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
 
::I think this is bomb-proof, so have made the change.  [[User:MAG1|MAG1]] 22:06, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

:: He was born in Warsaw (http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1995/rotblat-cv.html)- could someone please change it?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/128.243.253.114|128.243.253.114]] ([[User talk:128.243.253.114|talk]]) 18:38, 12 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Why doesn't he have a little gold medallion by his name... he's certainly earned it.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.39.212.101|74.39.212.101]] ([[User talk:74.39.212.101|talk]]) 08:39, 29 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Vandalism ==
I can't see an edit button on the page and I can't be arsed to create an account, so can someone else remove the &quot;strictly lesbian&quot; vandalism?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/91.125.96.28|91.125.96.28]] ([[User talk:91.125.96.28|talk]]) 21:41, 5 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Photo ==

This article once had a better-defined lead photo of Rotblat from a later stage of his life.  

It was apparently removed, and his present, poor-quality Los Alamos badge photo reinserted, due to questions of copyright about the later, better-quality photo.

Could someone please locate a better-quality public-domain photo of Rotblat to replace the present poor-quality lead Los Alamos photo?
