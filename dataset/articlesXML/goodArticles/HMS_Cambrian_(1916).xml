'''HMS ''Cambrian''''' was a [[C-class cruiser|C-class]] [[light cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War I]]. She was the [[name ship]] of her [[ship class|sub-class]] of four ships. Assigned to the [[Grand Fleet]], the ship played only a small role during the war. ''Cambrian'' was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic]] and [[Mediterranean Fleet]]s during the 1920s and was sent to support British interests in [[Turkey]] during the [[Chanak Crisis]] of 1922–23. The ship was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in late 1929. She was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1934.

==Design and description==
The C-class cruisers were intended to escort the fleet and defend it against enemy destroyers attempting to close within torpedo range. Ordered as part of the 1914–15 Naval Programme,&lt;ref name=f8&gt;Friedman, pp. 38, 42, 48&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Cambrian'' sub-class were a slightly larger and improved version of the preceding ''Calliope'' sub-class; ''Cambrian'', the last ship of her sub-class to be completed, differed from her [[sister ship]]s as she had a more powerful armament. The ships were {{convert|446|ft|m|1}} [[overall length|long overall]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|41|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a mean [[Draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|14|ft|10|in|m|1}}. [[Displacement (ship)|Displacement]] was {{convert|4320|LT|t|lk=on}} at normal and {{convert|4799|LT|t}} at [[deep load]].&lt;ref name=&quot;conways&quot;/&gt; ''Cambrian'' was powered by four direct-drive [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]], which produced a total of {{convert|40000|ihp|lk=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The turbines used steam generated by six [[Yarrow boiler]]s which gave her a speed of {{convert|28.5|kn|lk=in}}. She carried {{convert|841|LT|t|0}} tons of [[fuel oil]]. The ship had a crew of 368 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;conways&quot;&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cambrian''{{'}}s main armament consisted of three [[BL 6 inch Mk XII naval gun|BL 6-inch (152&amp;nbsp;mm) Mk XII guns]] that were mounted on the centreline. One gun was forward of the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and the last two were in the stern, with one gun [[superfiring]] over the rearmost gun. Her [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] consisted of six [[QF 4 inch naval gun Mk IV, XII, XXII|QF {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} Mk IV guns]], three on each side, one pair [[abaft]] the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] on the [[forecastle]] deck and the other two pairs one deck lower [[amidships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;conways&quot;/&gt; For [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defence]], she was fitted with one [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} Mk V]] gun.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The ship also mounted two submerged [[British 21-inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}]] [[torpedo tube]]s, one on each [[broadside]]. The ''Cambrian''s were protected by a [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] amidships that ranged in thickness from {{convert|1.5|-|3|in}} with a {{convert|1|in|adj=on}} [[deck (ship)|deck]]. The walls of their [[conning tower]] were 6 inches thick.&lt;ref name=&quot;conways&quot;/&gt;

===Wartime modifications===
During 1917–18, her pole [[foremast]] was replaced by a tripod mast that was fitted with a gunnery [[director (military)|director]]. In January 1919, ''Cambrian'' had her 4-inch guns removed and an additional 6-inch gun added abaft the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s. At the same time, her AA gun was replaced by a pair of [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|QF {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} 20-cwt]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;Cwt&quot; is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 20 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.&lt;/ref&gt; [[anti-aircraft gun]]s. Sometime between 1919 and 1924 the ship received a pair of [[QF 2 pounder naval gun#QF 2-pounder Mark II|2-pounder (40&amp;nbsp;mm) Mk II &quot;pom-pom&quot;]] guns on single mounts.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Cambrian'', the fourth ship of her name in the Royal Navy,&lt;ref&gt;Colledge, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Keel laying|laid down]] by [[Pembroke Dockyard]] in [[Pembroke Dock]], [[Wales]], on 8 December 1914, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 3 March 1916, and completed in May 1916. She was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into service that same month and was assigned to the [[4th Light Cruiser Squadron]] of the Grand Fleet in which she served through the end of World War I and until 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;conways&quot;/&gt; The squadron was generally tasked with screening the battleships of the Grand Fleet during the war. The ship did not participate in the inconclusive [[Action of 19 August 1916]] with the rest of her squadron. The squadron was briefly detached from the Grand Fleet in March 1917 to fruitlessly patrol off the Norwegian coast when news of a blockade runner was received by the [[Admiralty]].&lt;ref&gt;Newbolt, IV, p. 34, 192&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1919, ''Cambrian'' was refitted in [[Rosyth]] before she sailed for [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] where she was visited by the [[Edward VIII|Edward]], [[Prince of Wales]] on 13 June. The ship was assigned to the [[North American and West Indies Station]] the following month, where she served until 1922. ''Cambrian''{{'}}s crew spent several days in August trying to tow off the [[schooner]] ''Bella Scott'' after she had run aground near [[Kingston, Jamaica]] and received a brief refit in [[Bermuda]] in March–April 1920. The Prince of Wales again visited the ship on 26 September in [[Dominica]]. On 25 January 1921, she was inspected by [[Vice-Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] Sir [[William Pakenham (Royal Navy officer)|William Pakenham]] at Bermuda and again on 17 June. The ship arrived at [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] to participate in the [[Pilgrim Tercentenary]] celebrations on 31 July.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript&lt;/ref&gt;

She was part of the [[2nd Light Cruiser Squadron]] of the Atlantic Fleet from August 1922 until June 1924, and was detached to support British interests during the Chanak Crisis of 1922–23.&lt;ref name=&quot;conways&quot;/&gt; She escorted the [[seaplane carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|2}} from the UK to Turkey from 27 September to 8 October and was later [[guard ship]] at [[Smyrna]] in December.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 401, 423&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in June 1924 and began a refit that lasted into 1926, during which her aft control tower and searchlight platform was removed, when she was recommissioned to serve in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet&lt;ref name=&quot;conways&quot;/&gt; where she participated in a fleet exercise in March 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; After transporting troops to [[China]] in 1929, she was decommissioned in November 1929 and assigned to the [[Nore]] [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|Reserve]]. She was recommissioned as the [[flagship]] of the Nore Reserve in March 1931 and was then decommissioned in July 1933 at [[Sheerness]] and listed for sale.&lt;ref name=&quot;conways&quot;/&gt; ''Cambrian'' was sold for scrap on 28 July 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;
