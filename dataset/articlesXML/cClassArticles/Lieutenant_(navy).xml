{{Military ranks}}
'''Lieutenant'''&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The pronunciation of ''lieutenant'' is generally split between {{IPAc-en|l|ɛ|f|ˈ|t|ɛ|n|ən|t}} {{respell|lef|TEN|ənt}} or {{IPAc-en|l|ɨ|f|ˈ|t|ɛ|n|ən|t}}, generally in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Commonwealth countries, and {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-lieutenant-2.ogg|l|juː|ˈ|t|ɛ|n|ən|t}} {{respell|lew|TEN|ənt}} or {{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|t|ɛ|n|ən|t}}, generally associated with the United States. See [[lieutenant]].&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated '''Lt''', '''LT''', '''LT(N)''', '''Lieut''' and '''LEUT''', depending on nation) is a [[commissioned officer]] rank in many nations' [[navy|navies]]. It is typically the most senior of junior officer ranks. The rank's insignia usually consists of two medium gold braid stripes and often the uppermost stripe features a loop or executive curl.

The now immediately senior rank of [[lieutenant commander]] was formerly a senior naval lieutenant rank. Many navies also use a subordinate rank of [[sub-lieutenant]]. The appointment of &quot;first lieutenant&quot; in many navies is held by a senior lieutenant.

Naval lieutenants rank higher than [[Lieutenant#Army ranks|army lieutenants]]; a naval lieutenant is a [[Ranks and insignia of NATO|NATO OF-2]] (US grade O-3) and ranks with an [[Captain (armed forces)|army captain]].

==History==
From at least 1580,&lt;ref name=RNM/&gt; the lieutenant on a ship had been the officer immediately subordinate to the captain. Before the [[English Restoration]], lieutenants were appointed by their captains, and this inevitably led to abuses and to the widespread appointment of men of insufficient qualification. In 1677, [[Samuel Pepys]] introduced the first examination for lieutenant,&lt;ref&gt;''Gentlemen and Tarpaulins'', by J D Davies, Oxford University Press, 1991, ISBN 978-0-19-820263-9, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; and it is from the date of this examination that their seniority was set.

Lieutenants were numbered by their seniority within the ship, so that a frigate (which was entitled to three) would have a first lieutenant, a second lieutenant, and a third lieutenant. A [[First-rate|first-rate ship]] was entitled to six, and they were numbered accordingly. At first, a lieutenant's commission was given only for the ship in which he served, but with policy changes after the loss of [[HMS Wager (1739)|HMS ''Wager'']] in 1741 and the [[Wager Mutiny|subsequent mutiny]], lieutenants were given full commissions upon passing their examination.&lt;ref name=RNM&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm#Lt |title=Officer Ranks in the Royal Navy  - Lieutenant |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early days of the naval rank, some lieutenants could be very junior indeed, while others could be on the cusp of promotion to captain; those lieutenants ranged across modern army ranks from second lieutenant through lieutenant colonel. As the rank structure of navies stabilised, and the ranks of commander, lieutenant commander and sub-lieutenant were introduced, the naval lieutenant today ranks with an army captain (NATO OF-2 or US O-3).

In the United States Navy, promotion to lieutenant is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the [[Defense Officer Personnel Management Act]] of 1980. DOPMA guidelines suggest 95% of [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenants (junior grade)]] should be promoted to lieutenant after serving a minimum of two years at their present rank.

The insignia of a lieutenant in many navies, including the Royal Navy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3761 |title=Uniforms and Badges of Rank - Royal Navy website |accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of two medium [[gold braid]] stripes (top stripe with loop) on a [[navy blue]] or black background. This pattern was copied by the United States Navy and various air forces for their equivalent ranks grades, except that the loop is removed. (see [[flight lieutenant]]).

==&quot;First lieutenant&quot; in naval usage==
The '''first lieutenant''' (1st Lt or 1LT) in the [[Royal Navy]] and other Commonwealth navies, is a post or appointment, rather than a rank. Historically, the lieutenants in a ship were ranked in accordance with seniority, with the most senior being termed the first lieutenant and acting as the [[second-in-command]]. Although lieutenants are no longer numbered by seniority, the post of &quot;first lieutenant&quot; remains.

In minor war vessels, [[destroyer]]s and [[frigate]]s, the first lieutenant (either a lieutenant or lieutenant commander) is second in command, [[executive officer]] (XO) and head of the executive branch; in larger ships, where a commander of the warfare specialisation is appointed as the executive officer, a first lieutenant (normally a lieutenant commander) is appointed as his deputy. The post of first lieutenant in a [[shore establishment]] carries a similar responsibility to that of the first lieutenant of a [[capital ship]].

In the US Navy or US Coast Guard, the billet of first lieutenant describes the officer in charge of the [[deck department]] or division, depending on the size of the ship. In smaller ships that have only a single deck division, the billet is typically filled by an ensign; while in larger ships, with a deck department consisting of multiple subordinate divisions, the billet may be filled by a lieutenant commander. On submarines and smaller Coast Guard cutters, the billet of first lieutenant may be filled by a [[petty officer]].
