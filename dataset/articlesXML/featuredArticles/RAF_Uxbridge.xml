'''RAF Uxbridge''' was a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) station in [[Uxbridge]], within the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]], occupying a {{convert|44.6|ha|adj=on}} site that originally belonged to the [[Hillingdon House]] estate. The British Government purchased the estate in 1915, three years before the founding of the RAF. Until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the station was open to the public.

The station is best known as the headquarters of [[No. 11 Group RAF]], which was responsible for the aerial defence of London and the south-east of England during the [[Battle of Britain]]. Hillingdon House served as the group's headquarters. A bunker, subsequently known as the [[Battle of Britain Bunker]], was built nearby to house the 11&amp;nbsp;Group Operations Room, which controlled fighter squadrons operating within the group. The Operations Room was also responsible for providing air support during the evacuation of [[Dunkirk]] in May 1940 ([[Operation Dynamo]]) and the D-Day landings ([[Operation Overlord]]). It was here that [[Winston Churchill]] first said, &quot;[[Never was so much owed by so many to so few]]&quot;, which he repeated in a speech to Parliament four days later.

RAF Uxbridge closed on 31 March 2010 as part of a reduction in the number of Ministry of Defence properties in the [[Greater London]] area. Many of its remaining military units were relocated to nearby [[RAF Northolt]] the following day. Plans for redevelopment, consisting of a mixture of new residential and commercial properties and the retention of all listed buildings, were approved in January 2011.&lt;ref name=PlansApproved/&gt; A small part of the station incorporating the Battle of Britain Bunker retains the RAF Uxbridge name and is maintained by RAF Northolt.

The [[River Pinn]] runs through the site from north to south, passing Hillingdon House and the Battle of Britain Bunker. The land around the river is mainly wooded and designated as [[greenbelt]], and Hillingdon Golf Course borders the south of the station.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAF_Uxbridge&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/media/pdf/m/i/Pages_5-6_from_RAF_Uxbridge_ES_Scoping_FINAL_12_Jan_09-3.pdf |title=Environmental Statement: Site Description |date=January 2009 |pages=5–6 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A footpath through the site that had closed in 1988 was reopened in 2011.

==History==

===Early years===
[[File:Southern entrance to Hillingdon House.jpg|thumb|The southern entrance to Hillingdon House, c.&amp;nbsp;1900, later to become St Andrew's Gate.]]
The area that became RAF Uxbridge was originally part of the estate of Hillingdon House, built as a hunting lodge in 1717 by the [[Meinhardt Schomberg, 3rd Duke of Schomberg|Duke of Schomberg]], who staged regular hunts in the grounds. He was a German-born general serving under William of Orange (later [[William III of England|King William III]]), knighted for his part in the 1690 [[Battle of the Boyne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.5&quot;&gt;Crozier 2007, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marchioness of Rockingham, widow of Prime Minister [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham]], bought the house in 1786 for £9,000&lt;ref name=&quot;natarch&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/searches/subjectView.asp?ID=F6718 |title=Cox family of Hillingdon |publisher=National Archives |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; following her husband's death and lived there until her own death in 1804. She left the estate to her stepsister Elizabeth, widow of [[William Weddell]] MP, who sold it to Josias Du Pré Porcher in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42140&amp;strquery=William%20Weddell |title=Upper Brook Street |publisher=British History Online |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810 the estate was sold to Richard Henry Cox, grandson of Richard Cox, founder of the travel company [[Cox &amp; Kings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.5&quot;/&gt; Cox &amp; Co, as the company was then known, was formed after Richard Cox was appointed agent to the Foot Guards (later the [[Grenadier Guards]]), and provided banking services for many regiments of the British Army by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coxandkings.co.uk/aboutus-history.aspx |title=Centuries of Experience |year=2010 |publisher=Cox &amp; Kings |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion was completely rebuilt after it burnt down in 1844 and later received a [[Listed building|Grade II listing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillingdon listed&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/media/pdf/j/s/Listed_Buildings.pdf |title=Listed buildings | publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |page=13 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
In 1914 the mansion was put on the market by the estate of Frederick Cox, Richard Henry Cox's grandson. It was described as &quot;a brick and stone building, partly stuccoed, with extensive outbuildings and ornamental gardens.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;natarch&quot;/&gt; The house and gardens, together with the surrounding parkland and an artificial lake created by damming a section of the River Pinn, amounted to over {{convert|81|ha|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.5&quot;/&gt;

The British Government purchased the estate in 1915, with the intention of establishing a [[prisoner of war]] camp. The local population strongly opposed the plan, causing the government to relent, and the site instead became the Canadian Convalescent Hospital to care for troops evacuated from the front line during the First World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.6&quot;&gt;Crozier 2007, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital opened on 20 September 1915 and was joined on 19 November 1917 by the [[Royal Flying Corps]] Armament School which moved into Hillingdon House with 114 officers and 1156 men, making a donation of [[£sd|£2289, 12s and 9d]] to the [[Canadian Red Cross]]. The RFC used parts of the estate not required by the Canadians, and established firing ranges for the training of recruits in ground gunnery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.6&quot;/&gt; A total of eight of these ranges were built along the River Pinn; one remains today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/media/pdf/2/h/253_Rifle_Range__RAF_Uxbridge.pdf |title=Rifle Range |date=May 2010 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |page=1 |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital closed on 12 December 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.6&quot;/&gt;

On 1 April 1918, the Uxbridge site came under control of the Royal Air Force, which had been formed that day by the amalgamation of the Royal Flying Corps and the [[Royal Naval Air Service]]. The following month it became the first RAF station to receive a royal visit, from King George V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciltuk.org.uk/download_files/hg046report.pdf |title=11 Group Operations Room |last=Peacock |first=Michael |date=9 November 2010 |publisher=The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (UK) |page=1 |accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-war years===
The Recruits Training Depot and a detachment of the RAF Depot from [[RAF Halton]] arrived in August 1919, merging to form No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge.  The station itself was designated RAF Central Depot, Uxbridge. The site was then split to form two new RAF stations, the area to the east of the River Pinn heading uphill to Hillingdon House becoming RAF Hillingdon and the remainder RAF Uxbridge. That year, the building that became the station cinema was opened, designed by Lieutenant J.G.N. Clift of the [[Royal Engineers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1392376 |title=Cinema |year=2012 |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a lecture hall for new recruits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherwood 66&quot;&gt;Sherwood 2007, p.66&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF School of Music moved to RAF Uxbridge from Hampstead in September 1919. Headquarters Southern Area, Southern Area Medical Headquarters, Southern Area Barrack Stores, and the Southern Area and South Eastern Area Headquarters of the Air Construction Service moved into Hillingdon House in October 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier 2007, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  [[T. E. Lawrence]], better known as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, underwent initial training at the Uxbridge Depot in 1922 after enlisting in the RAF under the assumed name John Hume-Ross. He recounted his experiences in ''[[The Mint (book)|The Mint]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/index.jsp?articleid=8998 |title=T.E. Lawrence |date=23 October 2007 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RAF Uxbridge Officers' Mess.jpg|thumb|left|The Officers' Mess building at RAF Uxbridge]]
Uxbridge Football Club was provided with the use of the station stadium from 1923 and played evening matches there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skinner 25&quot;/&gt; Ten barrack blocks designed by A. Gilpin were built around the parade ground in 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/media/pdf/2/l/251_Residential_Barrack_Block__RAF_Uxbridge.pdf |title=Residential Barrack Block |date=May 2010 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |page=1 |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was the RAF officers' hospital and the original Operations Room, controlled by the Fighting Area of [[Air Defence of Great Britain]] (ADGB). The [[Air Ministry]] chose RAF Uxbridge as the new base for ADGB on 14 January 1926 owing to its proximity to [[Whitehall]]. The site had the added advantage of lying on the fringes of London and therefore difficult for an enemy to locate and bomb.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier 2007, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Having also housed a gymnasium, the lecture hall building became the station cinema in 1927, initially for the use of station personnel only but soon opened to the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherwood 66&quot;/&gt; On 1 March 1929, the headquarters of the [[Royal Observer Corps]] (ROC) was established at Hillingdon House; [[Air Commodore]] [[Edward Masterman]] was appointed as its first commandant. The Observer Corps remained at RAF Uxbridge until 1 March 1936, when it transferred to RAF Bentley Priory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.9&quot;/&gt;

Owing to its wooden construction the original Operations Room could only be used during the summer months; maintenance of the signalling and communications equipment became difficult under damp winter conditions. A memo dated 16 January 1933, sent to the senior Air Staff Officer, [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Modin, stated:
{{quote|Uxbridge Royal Air Force buildings would provide an easy bombing target from all points of view, I feel that our Operations Room at least must go underground&amp;nbsp;... and the sooner it is put there the better, as not only will the re-installation of communications and apparatus generally take time, but if that machinery is to function smoothly in a sudden emergency, installation must have been completed and the whole layout repeatedly worked and tried out before the danger of such emergency arises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.9&quot;&gt;Crozier 2007, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Douglas Bader]] arrived at the [[RAF Hospital Uxbridge|military hospital]] in 1932 to recover from the amputation of his legs following an air crash. During his stay Bader met the Desoutter brothers, who were beginning to make lightweight artificial legs from [[aluminium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/index.jsp?articleid=22430 |title=Sir Douglas Bader CBE, DSO, DFC |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once fitted with artificial legs, Bader fought hard to regain his former abilities and in time his efforts paid off. He was able to drive a specially modified car, play golf and even dance. During his convalescence, Bader met his future wife Thelma Edwards, a waitress at a nearby pub called the Pantiles.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1983, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

Formed on 1 May 1936, No. 11 Group RAF was headquartered at RAF Uxbridge under the command of [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Philip Joubert de la Ferté]], who was succeeded by Sir [[Leslie Gossage|Ernest Gossage]] in January 1937. The ADGB was reorganised on 13 July 1936, with control of fighter aircraft passing to the newly established [[RAF Fighter Command]], which moved to [[RAF Bentley Priory]]. The following day the remaining elements of ADGB became [[RAF Bomber Command]], headquartered in Hillingdon House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafhighwycombe/aboutus/history.cfm |title=History of Royal Air Force High Wycombe |year=2011 |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning for the new No. 11 Group Operations Room (within what became known as the Battle of Britain Bunker) began in August 1937. Initially it was to be buried {{Convert|66|ft}} below ground, but problems with the local [[London Clay]] on the site meant it was eventually built by [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] at a depth of {{convert|60|ft}}, although it was still able to withstand being hit by a {{Convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb. The bunker was designed by Bob Creer of the Air Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-501317-group-operations-room-uxbridge |title=Group Operations Room, Uxbridge |publisher=British Listed Buildings |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work began in February 1939 and finished in August, ten days before the outbreak of the Second World War. The original Operations Room on the surface remained as a back-up, but was not required for that purpose and was subsequently renamed Building 76.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier 2007, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Also in August 1939, Bomber Command moved to [[Iver]] and on 2 September the new Operations Room and RAF Uxbridge reached operational war readiness.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier 2007, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The station closed to the public on the outbreak of war, and the football club was required to suspend its use of the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skinner 25&quot;&gt;Skinner 2008, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
[[File:Plotting Table.jpg|thumb|The plotting table inside the Battle of Britain Bunker]]
During the war RAF Uxbridge was tasked with despatching personnel to and from training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where [[Polish Air Force]] pilots were taught key RAF codewords.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier 2007, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Pilots practised formation flying on the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with radios, compasses and speed indicators.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] troops returning from [[Dunkirk]] were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier 2007, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Battle of Britain, between July and October 1940, RAF Fighter Command at RAF Bentley Priory received air threat warnings that it filtered to remove duplication, doubt and confusion. These were then forwarded to the Operations Room at RAF Uxbridge, which allocated appropriate defence resources and passed orders on to No. 11 Group sector airfields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1321296 |title=RAF Uxbridge |publisher=Past Scape |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; No. 11 Group personnel doubled to 20,000 between April and November 1940. The RAF officers' hospital was converted to the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF) hospital early in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.15&quot;&gt;Crozier 2007, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doorway to Park House, RAF Uxbridge.jpg|thumb|left|Doorway to the former Park House, used by Air Vice Marshal Sir [[Keith Park]]]]
While overseeing the operations at RAF Uxbridge, Air Vice Marshal Park stayed in a house opposite the entrance to the bunker. He used a small door to reach the bunker from the house each day. The house, named after the war in Park's honour, was demolished in 1996 to make way for newly constructed married quarters; only the garden wall and door were retained.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner 2008, pp.66–67&lt;/ref&gt; Wing Commander [[John Verney, 20th Baron Willoughby de Broke|Willoughby de Broke]] received the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] on 11 July 1940 for his service as a Senior Operations Officer for No. 11 Group, working within the Operations Room.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier 2007, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] visited the station on 16 August 1940, to monitor the battle from the Operations Room. He subsequently made his well-known comment, &quot;Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few&quot; to [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]] as they got into their car to leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.29&quot;&gt;Crozier 2007, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill repeated the quote in a speech to Parliament four days later.&lt;ref name=Farewell&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalaviationresource.com/reports/2010/uxbridge.php |title=Farewell to RAF Uxbridge |date=6 April 2010 |publisher=Global Aviation Resource |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] visited the station on 6 September. Churchill was again present at RAF Uxbridge on the fiercest day of fighting of the entire battle: [[Battle of Britain Day]], 15 September 1940. As the last squadrons were sent into battle, Churchill asked Air Vice Marshal Sir Keith Park, &quot;How many reserves have we?&quot; Park answered &quot;There are none&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.29&quot;/&gt;

A delayed-action landmine fell on the station on 26 September 1940, between the police school and WAAF Quarters, where it remained until it was defused the following day. On 28 September a bomb fell into a tree {{convert|50|yd}} from the Operations Room and was later defused in Harefield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skinner 100&quot;&gt;Skinner 2008, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Junkers Ju 88]] attacked the station on 6 October 1940, dropping a bomb beside the [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes]] (NAAFI) grocery shop. The device damaged water and gas mains but caused no casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.15&quot;/&gt;  Few bombs fell on the station; Luftwaffe pilots may have mistaken the glass greenhouses at the Lowe &amp; Shawyer [[plant nursery]] west of the station for a large body of water not on their maps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skinner 100&quot;/&gt;

The king and queen returned on 1 November 1941, by which time a &quot;Royal Box&quot; had been installed in the Operations Room to allow them to observe the plotting activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.29&quot;/&gt; During 1942, General [[Charles de Gaulle]], Sir [[Anthony Eden]] and [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] all visited the 11&amp;nbsp;Group Operations Room.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.29&quot;/&gt; The actors [[Rex Harrison]] (then a squadron leader liaising with Bomber Command), [[Cyril Raymond]] and [[Ronald Adam (actor)|Ronald Adam]] all served within the Operations Room during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner 2008, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, a division of the [[Meteorological Office]] was established at RAF Uxbridge as part of the Intelligence Branch.

RAF Uxbridge served as an athlete's village for the male competitors in the [[1948 Summer Olympics]]. Swimmers trained at nearby [[Uxbridge Lido]], and female athletes were housed at [[RAF West Drayton]].&lt;ref&gt;Skinner 2008, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel from RAF Uxbridge were moved out to [[RAF Stanmore Park]] and transported back to the station daily for their shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/west-london-news/letters-to-the-editor/2012/07/18/your-letters-this-week-july-18-113046-31437173/ |title=Your letters this week (July 18) |last=Fewkes |first=Caroline |date=18 July 2012 |work=Uxbridge Gazette |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the RAF Cricket Association opened on Vine Lane on the western boundary of the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcricket/rafvinelane.cfm |title=RAF Vine Lane |year=2011 |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also moving into the stations grounds in October of that year were the 14F squadron or the Air Training Corps,their access also being via Vine Lane.The station's crest was approved in April 1953, incorporating a drill sergeant's pace stick to symbolise the training of recruits, and a bugle to represent the [[Central Band of the RAF]]; Uxbridge was the first RAF station in Middlesex to have a crest approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.middlesex-heraldry.org.uk/publications/seaxe/Seaxe33-200006.pdf |title=Royal Air Force heraldry in Middlesex |last=Symons |first=Roland |date=June 2000 |publisher=Middlesex Heraldry Society |page=1 |accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremonial entrance to the north-west of the station, St Andrew's Gate, was officially opened on 16 December 1957 to mark the link between Uxbridge and the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/media/pdf/2/2/257_St_Andrew%27s_Ceremonial_gates__RAF_Uxbridge.pdf |title=St Andrew's Ceremonial Gates |date=May 2010 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |page=1 |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial to the personnel of No. 11 Group, made of Cornish granite, was placed in the ground above the Operations Room in 1957. No. 11 Group moved to [[RAF Martlesham Heath]] on 14 April 1958 and the room was soon sealed in its original condition. The memorial was unveiled by Air Chief Marshal [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Lord Dowding]] on 23 April 1958 in a ceremony attended by Group Captain Douglas Bader and Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, among others, and marked by a [[flypast]] of the [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.20&quot;/&gt; Control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to Technical Training Command that year, at which time the entire site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from [[RAF Spitalgate]] on 10 November 1958,&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.20&quot;/&gt; and the station was subsequently merged with [[No. 22 Group RAF]].&lt;ref name=Gazetteflypast&gt;{{Cite news |title=Spitfire flypast to mark closure of RAF Uxbridge |last=Coombs |first=Dan |newspaper=Uxbridge Gazette |date=31 March 2010 |url=http://www.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/west-london-news/local-uxbridge-news/2010/03/31/spitfire-flypast-to-mark-closure-of-raf-uxbridge-113046-26145597/ |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station was granted the [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the London Borough of Hillingdon]] on 19 March 1960, an honour allowing the station's personnel to march throughout the borough in uniform. On 1 November that year, the [[Queen's Colour Squadron]] of the [[RAF Regiment]] moved to Uxbridge and the Southern Region Air Traffic Services headquarters moved into Hillingdon House. After the war, the station was already home to the [[London Area Control Centre]], renamed the London Air Traffic Control Centre in 1948 and the Uxbridge Air Traffic Control Centre in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.20&quot;&gt;Crozier 2007, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually transferred to RAF West Drayton but remained under the parentage of RAF Uxbridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.32&quot;&gt;Crozier 2007, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11&amp;nbsp;Group Operations Room was extensively surveyed in order for a replica to be built at [[Pinewood Studios]] for the 1969 film ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]''. Scenes for the 1996 television miniseries ''[[Over Here (TV serial)|Over Here]]'' and an episode of [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]]' ''[[War Walks]]'' were filmed in the Operations Room itself.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier et al 2010, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; The reinforced Uniter building was built on the site in the 1970s to house communications equipment.

Over nine months in 1975, the 11&amp;nbsp;Group Operations Room was restored by No. 9 Signals Unit.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier 2007 p.22&lt;/ref&gt; The original map was repaired and returned to the table by the RAF Cartography unit, and the board detailing the readiness and activities of each sector squadron was rebuilt to resemble its status on 15 September 1940. In 1985 a museum was created within the bunker by Warrant Officer &quot;Chris&quot; Wren and the Operations Room opened for group visits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.23&quot;/&gt;

In January 1981, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) planted a bomb in the Suvla barrack block at RAF Uxbridge. The device was discovered and the 35&amp;nbsp;RAF musicians and 15&amp;nbsp;airmen living there were evacuated before it exploded. Following the incident, an enquiry began and security at all RAF stations was reviewed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier p.23&quot;&gt;Crozier 2007, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, many RAF personnel from the station were deployed during the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref&gt;Crozier 2007, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; The station went on to celebrate its 70th anniversary in 1987 by staging several events that raised £30,000 for the [[RAF Benevolent Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;Crozier et al 2010, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Britain operations room.JPG|thumb|The restored Operations Room in the No. 11 Group Battle of Britain Bunker]]
RAF Uxbridge also became involved in [[Operation Granby]] following the Iraqi [[Invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990. Personnel at Uxbridge were prepared for service in the Gulf at that time, and deployed that year in December. During the aerial assault on Iraq in January 1991, support group meetings began at the station for the families of service personnel serving during the [[Gulf War]]. [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]], visited one of these groups in February 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier 2010 22&quot;&gt;Crozier et al 2010, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

The station church, St Luke's, became structurally unsound on 21 November 1990 after the foundations failed. The building dated back to 1933 and had been constructed of wood; the walls were pushed out and the floor rose by {{convert|4|inch}}. In March 1993, the Leigh-Mallory bridge was opened across the River Pinn, and the church moved into a new permanent home, Building 231, in March 1995. [[Jim Bolger]], then [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]], visited the station in May, and in October, the station's new sports centre opened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crozier 2010 22&quot;/&gt;

RAF Uxbridge personnel were once more prepared for action in the Gulf in 2003 in readiness for [[Operation Telic]] in [[Iraq]]. A support network for the families of service personnel sent into action was again established at the station. In March 2003 the [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Under-Secretary of State]] for Defence was briefed at Uxbridge as part of preparations for a visit to the Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier 2007, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen's Colour Squadron returned from a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2009, marked by a homecoming parade through Uxbridge town centre held on 5 August 2009. More than 20,000&amp;nbsp;people watched the parade, which started from Uxbridge Magistrates Court, passing along the town's High Street to the RAF station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Crowds welcome home 63 The Royal Squadron RAF Regiment |last=Sharp |first=Rachel |url=http://www.hillingdontimes.co.uk/news/localnews/4529994.Thousands_welcome_home_troops_from_Afganistan/ |newspaper=Hillingdon &amp; Uxbridge Times |date=5 August 2009 |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure and redevelopment==
[[File:Battle of Britain Bunker - June 2013.jpg|thumb|Replica Spitfire gate guardian outside the Battle of Britain Bunker]]
Prior to the closure of RAF Uxbridge, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] sent a message to the station in February 2010, via her [[equerry]], Wing Commander A.D. Calame, who had served as Officer Commanding the Queen's Colour Squadron between 10 August 2005 and 16 July 2007:
{{quote|Her Majesty was interested to hear that, in this anniversary year, the historic Number 11 Group Operations Rooms Bunker has been listed and will be preserved as a Royal Air Force asset. Hopefully, the facility will continue as a permanent reminder of those who fought and won the Battle of Britain.&lt;br/&gt;Her Majesty hopes that the relocation to Royal Air Force Northolt will continue to progress well, and wishes all personnel at Uxbridge best wishes for the future.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier et al 2010, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The station closed on 31 March 2010 as part of the Ministry of Defence's [[Project MoDEL]], a programme to reduce the number of defence sites in [[Greater London]] in favour of a core site at RAF Northolt. The closure ceremony was overseen by the Mayor of Hillingdon and included parades and the final lowering of the [[Royal Air Force Ensign]] over the parade ground.&lt;ref name=Farewell/&gt; A [[Supermarine Spitfire]] conducted a flypast of the station.&lt;ref name=Gazetteflypast/&gt; The final units marched to their new station at RAF Northolt the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Units from RAF Uxbridge will march in to RAF Northolt |newspaper=Ealing Times |date=1 April 2010 |url=http://www.ealingtimes.co.uk/news/6423051.Troops_to_march_in_at_RAF_Northolt_today/ |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station, which had received the Freedom of the Borough of Hillingdon, returned the award to the London Borough of Hillingdon as part of the ceremony,&lt;ref name=Ceremony&gt;{{Cite news |title=Closing ceremony for historic RAF Uxbridge |newspaper=Hillingdon &amp; Uxbridge Times |date=31 March 2010 |url=http://www.hillingdontimes.co.uk/news/localnews/6242900.RAF_Uxbridge_holds_closing_ceremony/ |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this was returned on 4 September to be stored in the museum of the Battle of Britain Bunker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Commemoration&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Battle of Britain commemoration service held at RAF Uxbridge |newspaper=Hillingdon &amp; Uxbridge Times |date=4 September 2010 |url=http://www.hillingdontimes.co.uk/news/8372681.Service_held_at_RAF_Uxbridge_to_remember__The_Few_/ |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commemorative blue plaque dedicated to Douglas Bader was unveiled by the Mayor of Hillingdon at the entrance to the Officers' Mess.&lt;ref name=Ceremony/&gt;

The South Hillingdon branch of the [[St. John Ambulance]] service was based at RAF Uxbridge until the closure in 2010 led to a period of uncertainty over its relocation.

The path, {{convert|800|m}} long, was the subject of a petition submitted to Hillingdon Council in 2010 and had been closed since 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Path to be re-opened through RAF Uxbridge |last=Coombs |first=Dan |newspaper=Uxbridge Gazette |date=1 June 2011 |url=http://uxbridge.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/2011/06/a-path-through-the-centre.html |accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The path was reopened in early August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='Vital' footpath reopens after 23 years |last=Coombs |first=Dan |newspaper=Uxbridge Gazette |date=4 August 2011 |url=http://www.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/west-london-news/local-uxbridge-news/2011/08/04/vital-footpath-reopens-after-23-years-113046-29169583/ |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since closing, the site has been used extensively for filming. Most recently, scenes for the television drama ''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]'', set in the 1960s, were filmed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Endeavour: an inspector recalled |last=Barnett |first=Laura |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/jan/01/endeavour-inspector-morse |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 January 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, VSM Estates announced it would be completing the purchase of the site from the MoD, with a view to commencing building work by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New homes on RAF site to be 'speeded up' |url=http://www.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/west-london-news/local-uxbridge-news/2012/04/24/new-homes-on-raf-site-to-be-speeded-up-113046-30827733/ |newspaper=Uxbridge Gazette |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; VSM were provided with a £60 million five-year loan by [[HSBC]], together with funding from joint parent companies, [[St. Modwen Properties]] and Vinci plc.

A wood commemorating the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] was planted within the site in May 2012. Each school in the London Borough of Hillingdon was invited to plant a tree, and the Station Commander of RAF Northolt, Group Captain Tim O'Brien, also planted one on behalf of the RAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/index.jsp?articleid=25048 |title=Hillingdon Council celebrates Queen's Jubilee with commemorative wood |date=30 May 2012 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wood was officially dedicated by the London Borough of Hillingdon's Representative Deputy Lieutenant, Wing Commander Edna Partridge, on 19 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/media/pdf/9/2/HPSept-Oct_2012-web-spreads.pdf |title=Diamond Jubilee Commemorated |date=September 2012 |page=17 |work=Hillingdon People |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Groundbreaking|ground-breaking]] ceremony was held on 2 July 2013 on the site, attended by the Mayor of Hillingdon and cabinet members of Hillingdon Council. The development is due to be completed within seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Former RAF Uxbridge regeneration project kicks off |url=http://www.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/west-london-news/local-uxbridge-news/2013/07/02/former-raf-uxbridge-regeneration-project-kicks-off-113046-33556590/ |newspaper=Uxbridge Gazette |date=2 July 2013 |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new primary school, built on the site of the former sports ground and gym, opened in September 2014. Named the John Locke Academy, the school will have 630 primary places and 90 nursery places when fully subscribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Uxbridge school reflects sporting heritage of RAF site |url=http://www.hillingdontimes.co.uk/news/11439616.New_Uxbridge_school_reflects_sporting_heritage_of_RAF_site/ |newspaper=Hillingdon &amp; Uxbridge Times |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional planning application for the construction of office buildings was submitted by St. Modwen in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cumber|first1=Rob|title=New offices at former RAF base 'to create 1,000 jobs'|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/west-london-news/new-offices-former-raf-base-9377409|accessdate=7 September 2015|work=Uxbridge Gazette|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
