==Untitled==
Appearences in Movies and Popular Culture
The castle is mentioned in the Target novelisation of the Doctor Who Story The Ark where companion Dodo Chaplet impliesthat she has visited the castle.

The Castle has also been used as a location in many films;

Think we need to add to this if it is to be of real value.  Where it states &quot;many films&quot;, can we amplify?  I know of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; (Stephen Weeks, director, 1973) but can't immediately think of any more.  Often thought to have been used in &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; but I think this was actually Peckforton, Cheshire.  Any others?

[[User:KJP1|KJP1]] 19:40, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

Just watched a film called &quot;Siege of the Saxons&quot; in which Castle Coch features.  &lt;small&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/90.240.41.248|90.240.41.248]] ([[User talk:90.240.41.248|talk]]) 23:10, 4 June 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Castle Coch's surroundings ==

I gather from [[Castell_Coch_Woodlands_and_Road_Section]] that the surrounding woodlands are listed as a site of special scientific interest. That is probably noteworthy [[User:EdwardLane|EdwardLane]] ([[User talk:EdwardLane|talk]]) 09:01, 13 April 2011 (UTC)

== Building stone ==

The current infobox lists the materials as ''[[Carboniferous]] [[Sandstone]] [[Ashlar]]'', without citing a source. I think it is built of [[Old Red Sandstone]] (Devonian, not Carboniferous), based on the colour of the stone and on this being a common local building stone. The [http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-13644-castell-coch-tongwynlais listed building citation] does not mention the type of stone, nor does Newman in ''The Building of Wales: Glamorgan''. In the absence of a citable reference I will remove this. [[User:Verbcatcher|Verbcatcher]] ([[User talk:Verbcatcher|talk]]) 20:41, 13 November 2014 (UTC)

== Where to mention Listed Building status? ==


User [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) has reverted my removal of the Grade I listed building status and the listing date from the lead section with the comment ''&quot;I think the intro should state it's a Grade I listed building&quot;''. We also give the listed building status under ''Architecture''.

I feel that while the listed building status should be mentioned it is a relatively mundane and bureaucratic attribute which does not deserve a place in the lead section. It is not necessary to establish the ''notability'' of this building. For comparison, [[Windsor Castle]] (a ''[[Wikipedia:Featured articles|featured article]]'') only refers to its listed building status in its ''Categories''.

Even if we keep the Grade I listing status in the lead paragraph, what is the point of giving the date when the building was listed? Who is this for? [[User:Verbcatcher|Verbcatcher]] ([[User talk:Verbcatcher|talk]]) 22:13, 20 November 2014 (UTC)

:In my opinion, it's usually better to explain ''why'' a building has Grade I listed status in the lead, rather than simply noting its legal status. For example, if we explained in the lead that [[Peter Floud]] considered the castle to be &quot;one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition&quot; (which is part of the reason for its Grade I status) it would tell the reader much more about the property than simply the status, which would then become superfluous. I'd recommend keeping the listed building protection in the architecture paragraph though. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 22:50, 20 November 2014 (UTC)

::At the risk of opening a different can of worms, the Infobox is the place I would hope to find it. It currently uses {{Tl|Infobox Military Structure}} which doesn't have any place for that. {{Tl|Infobox historic site}} might make more sense, and from a quick look, would seem to cover the information it needs. I agree that as it stands it is very odd in the lead, and that it should be expanded on in the Architecture para. [[User:RobinLeicester|RobinLeicester]] ([[User talk:RobinLeicester|talk]]) 23:35, 20 November 2014 (UTC)

:::I also favour putting ''Grade I listed'' into the Infobox. Infobox Military Structure seems a poor fit for Castell Coch, although it is used for other Welsh castles. We could use ''[[Tower of London]]'' as a model, which uses Infobox historic site to indicate a Grade I listed building. Does anyone support retaining the date of the listing? [[User:Verbcatcher|Verbcatcher]] ([[User talk:Verbcatcher|talk]]) 02:08, 21 November 2014 (UTC)

::::Either in the Infobox or the lead would seem quite appropriate.  But not, I think, buried at the very end of the article.  I don't think that the Grade I listing can properly be considered a &quot;mundane and bureaucratic attribute&quot;.  It is a recognition, and confirmation, of the building's &quot;exceptional architectural and historical interest&quot;.  But I absolutely agree it would be better for the lead also to explain '''why''' it is exceptional. That was what the descriptive quotations - &quot;the most spectacular example of [Burges's] translation from High Gothic into High Victorian.&quot; -  it originally contained where intended to do.  But those were removed, along with the reference to its listing.  [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 07:33, 21 November 2014 (UTC)

:::::p.s. As to the date of its listing, there I agree I am just being pedantic! [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 07:39, 21 November 2014 (UTC)

For me, the Tower of London article is an example of where I don't think it should have been in the infobox at all (if a building is recognised and protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site, its grade I &amp; II listed status sort of fades into insignificance!) I'd support it being in the infobox ''and'' in the lead, but I'm not convinced of the logic of putting it in an infobox but ''not'' in the lead; for me, the infobox is about presenting &quot;key facts at a glance&quot;, and if its legal status is a key fact, then I think it should be in the lead as well. My preference would be to explain the significance of the architecture with one of the quotes in the lead, and leave its legal status for the main body of the text. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 11:08, 21 November 2014 (UTC)

:As we do name have unanimity we must try for consensus. I ''think'' the consensus is that we add a quote praising the building in the lead section, but do not mention the listing there. We describe the listing in the architecture section. We are further from a consensus on the infobox, so I suggest we leave this as it is. Do we agree that this is the consensus from this discussion?

:If this is the consensus then someone needs to move the quote to the lead paragraph. I don't have access to the source for the quote from Peter Floud; someone who does should add it. The author should be named in the main text: see [[WP:MOSQUOTE]]. The existing text in the Architecture section on the Grade I listing can stand. [[User:Verbcatcher|Verbcatcher]] ([[User talk:Verbcatcher|talk]]) 20:17, 23 November 2014 (UTC)

::I have access to the Floud quote, and indeed loads of others, which indicate the castle's architectural and historical significance.  I shall therefore add them.  One point on attribution: I'm not sure I agree with Verbcatcher that this '''must''' be given.  The full [[WP:MOSQUOTE]] states &quot;The author of a quote ''of a full sentence or more'' should be named; this is done in the main text&quot; (my italics).  The Floud quote was not a full sentence.  Anyway, I shall have a go and people can see what they think.  [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 18:25, 27 November 2014 (UTC)
:::Quotations added.  I think the &quot;unrivalled intoxication&quot; conveys the impact of the castle quite well.  On the one occasion I persuaded my mother to visit, her only comment was that the building had given her &quot;a splitting headache.&quot;  [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 19:19, 27 November 2014 (UTC)

==Revisions to the article==

Overlooking the wanton destruction of some of my more flowery, Burges-obsessed, prose - although, at some point, I shall weave back in &quot;Together, at Cardiff and at Castell Coch, they would build their magnificent vision of a lost medieval world&quot; - I really like the way it's shaping up.  I thought it would help to have a space here where we could raise any issues, rather than spread them across our three talkpages.  If everyone's happy with the approach, let's crack on. Best regards, [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 20:49, 15 March 2015 (UTC)

===Images===
{{Reply to|Dr. Blofeld}}

Dear Lord - we '''must''' get some better photos.  What are those benches doing stacked up in the Drawing Room?  Dr. B, get up there with your camera! [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 18:56, 21 March 2015 (UTC)
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; The [[National Library of Wales]] have just added an 1808 oil painting to the article. This might replace the b&amp;W image of a similar date but I didn't want to delete anything without the knowledge of regular editors and contributors to this article. I hope the addition of the new image helps to improve the article. [[User:Jason.nlw|Jason.nlw]] ([[User talk:Jason.nlw|talk]]) 08:47, 9 April 2015 (UTC)
:Thanks {{ping|Jason.nlw}} - I'd seen it on the website before, but it wasn't free for use then; congrats to the NLW for releasing it! Could I ask a favour though? The metadata on the image in the Wikicommons says that &quot;this image and data related to the image may be reproduced for non-commercial research and private study purposes&quot;, which doesn't marry up with the licensing above it, which allows for any potential use (if you click &quot;expand&quot; on the metadata button near the bottom the details will come up). Although the licensing on the Commons looks correct, this default metadata could cause problems for users in the future, particularly since the image has a secure invisible digital watermark. Is there any possibility of uploading a replacement image with the licensing updated to reflect the donation to the Commons? [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 10:40, 9 April 2015 (UTC)

::Thanks {{ping|Hchc2009}} We hadn't thought of the Metadata. The copyright tag is old and actually goes against our latest policy on open access. I have fixed this by basically removing the Exif metadata, of which their was little besides the copyright tag. It's not ideal, but I hope it will suffice for now. We will be looking at changing these tags across our collections in the coming months and years. [[User:Jason.nlw|Jason.nlw]] ([[User talk:Jason.nlw|talk]]) 12:18, 9 April 2015 (UTC)

===Chapel stained glass===
We've got repetition on this in both the Reconstruction section and the Other rooms section.  I think I'd leave it in Other rooms and have the Reconstruction section read &quot;An oratory that had originally been built onto the Well Tower was removed before 1891.In other respects the completed castle was left unaltered.[49]&quot;. [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 18:14, 22 March 2015 (UTC)
:We probably need to mention their purchase in 2011 though as part of the history section, as its a notable recent event, which means we need some reference to their existence before then for the event to make sense... [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 18:20, 22 March 2015 (UTC)
::In fact, we've the same story three times - it's also in 20-21st century section. I'll have a look at re-wording. [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 18:26, 22 March 2015 (UTC)

===Terry Measham===
Does anyone have a copy of Measham to hand? The records for it suggest that it was aimed at children (a &quot;juvenile audience&quot;) and I was wondering if it was really a high-quality source or not? I'd be concerned if it was a book for youngsters, but the record might not be accurate! [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 18:23, 22 March 2015 (UTC)
:Looking at it now.  Definitely not a childrens' book.  Measham was an assistant Keeper at the Tate and it's not written for children - way too much text. [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 18:28, 22 March 2015 (UTC)

===Quick thoughts===
A couple of things we probably need to work out (minor ones) before the article goes to peer review etc.:
* &quot;the Marquess&quot; or &quot;the marquess&quot;, as used as an alternative to Bute's name?
:'''M'''arquess, as it's Bute. 
* &quot;the Gatehouse&quot; or &quot;the gatehouse&quot;? Most of the sources (but not all) prefer &quot;the Hall Block&quot; etc., and I think &quot;the Gatehouse&quot; might also be preferred.
:after my furniture capitalization issues at the Tower House, I'd go for the Gatehouse.
* Metrics (x ft, y m etc.) - any preference for imperial or metric first? (either is acceptable, but we should be consistent) [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 19:17, 23 March 2015 (UTC)
:Sorry, not a clue.
:No expert on MoS but my suggestions above. [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 08:25, 24 March 2015 (UTC)
::Marquess done; I've updated the modern references to the Gatehouse accordingly as well. 17:39, 24 March 2015 (UTC)

===Model for Lady B's Bedroom===
Have de-emphasized Burges's involvement in the actual decoration.  Matthew Williams's article on the model in ''Architectural History'' (2003) says the model &quot;was made to show the intended structure, and may well have been left undecorated for some years. The decoration of (the) bedroom was not undertaken until 1887 and stylistically owes little to (Burges).&quot;  So he can't be held responsible for &quot;The Palace of the Saracen Princess&quot;!  It would be good to quote the article but I don't know how we cite it, as it's behind the JSTOR wall.  [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 06:20, 25 March 2015 (UTC)
:Have put in in, minus url.  [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 06:32, 25 March 2015 (UTC)
::I've got a copy, will work through it in a moment. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 17:39, 25 March 2015 (UTC)

===A house for occasional occupation in the summer===

I'm wondering about the use of the term &quot;summer house&quot;.  Does it conjure up an image something like this [http://www.homebase.co.uk/en/homebaseuk/garden/garden-buildings-and-conservatories/summer-houses-and-log-cabins]?  What about if we give the full quote first time round?
:On a related point - I'm not seeing much else that needs doing/adding.  Is it nearly ready for peer review?  [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 06:16, 26 March 2015 (UTC)
::My image of a [[summer house]] is a bit broader, and I'm keen that we try to avoid too many quotes, as it is quite a &quot;quote heavy&quot; piece already, but happy to go with any consensus. Perhaps we can link it? I agree - I think it mostly just needs tidying up now - almost there! [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 07:05, 26 March 2015 (UTC)

===Burges's death===

Williams is specific, but Crook (p341) says Cardiff.  Could this be interpreted broadly as the Cardiff area?  Is it likely that, when in South Wales, at a point when he was working on both buildings, he'd have visited both?  Probably.  Not sure about wording.  [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 06:26, 27 March 2015 (UTC)
:He'd definitely have visited Cardiff in order to get a carriage up to Castell, both because of the transport links of the periods and, as you say, because he had ongoing projects in both locations. Indeed, some would consider Tongwynlais to be just on the outskirts of Cardiff, so I also buy the &quot;broad&quot; interpretation of the phrase &quot;Cardiff&quot; by Crook. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 08:08, 27 March 2015 (UTC)

===Protocol for naming people===

I've been taking a quick look at the way we describe people in the article (e.g. &quot;the historian John Smith&quot;, &quot;John Smith&quot;, or just &quot;Smith&quot;). I'm going to suggest that to ensure consistency, we introduce with a full name when first used at the section level (e.g. &quot;History&quot;, &quot;Architecture&quot; sections) and thereafter in the section just use the surname. That means that we would introduce again if they reappear in a later section, which would be helpful for the reader flicking through it. What do you reckon? [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 13:03, 27 March 2015 (UTC)
:Sounds very sensible and helpful.  You ok to do it or do you want me to have a go?  [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 17:03, 28 March 2015 (UTC)

===bretache===

Do we need a note explaining this?  I can find only one other use on Wikipedia, at [[Threave Castle]] and it's at least as obscure as &quot;tourelle&quot;.  I'll try and put one in.  [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 14:22, 7 April 2015 (UTC)
:I learn that a bretache is also the noseguard on the helmet of a suit of armour.  Should we explain this, or is it clear that the note refers to a bretache '''''in this context'''''.  [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 15:35, 7 April 2015 (UTC)
::I think the note is probably clear enough; I don't think that it is likely to be confused with the noseguard! ;) [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 15:42, 7 April 2015 (UTC)
:::I think you're right, but I wanted my first footnote to be irreproachable! [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 16:54, 7 April 2015 (UTC)

: They're not obscure in Europe, just unknown as survivors in the UK and only rarely recreated (the two best known are both Bute's).

::I think [[hoarding (castle)]] works very well and will add.  What's the other Bute one you're thinking of?  The, now-disappeared, Cardiff Castle one, or another?

===Tripadvisor===
I love Tripadvisor reviews.  This one, of Cardiff, is particularly good:
:&quot;..the Earl of Bute's lodgings, which in a burst of high camp Victorian hysteria he had done up as Arabian fantasy chambers in the style of Walt Disney.&quot; [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 06:34, 10 April 2015 (UTC)

===[[Murder holes]] and other defences===
{{reply to|User:Hchc2009}} Out of interest, why was Burges probably mistaken as to the use of [[Murder holes]]?

:The late Victorians believed that murder holes were routinely used in medieval warfare to drop boiling water and oil on incoming attackers, which is where Burges drew his opinion, which was therefore accurate by the standards of the day. Modern historical opinion is inclined to be much more cautious about this; there are occasional comments by chroniclers, but only a few, and it seems more likely that murder holes were used to dispense arrows, rocks etc. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 10:31, 11 April 2015 (UTC)

===Ghosts===
{{u|Hchc2009}} I've encountered an article in the South Wales Echo mentioning ghosts in Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. For Castell is says &quot; At Castell Coch it's all about the so-called White Lady who died a broken heart after her son drowned in a local pond. Some say there's a buried hoard of treasure here which is zealously protected by three eagles, while an ethereal cavalier walks the castle grounds.&quot; Cardiff Castle mention says &quot; There are quite a few spooky goings on at CardiffCastle. A coach is said to be heard when a member of the Hastings family is due to die. At the castle Â¦it was heard by John Boyle, the night his cousin the Marquis Hastings died. Other ghosts reporteded to haunt the castle include the second Marques of Bute (who walks through several walls - apparently!), a faceless woman in a long skirt who is known as Sarah, and a 3m tall giant who walks around the park. This pictures was taken outside CardiffCastle around 1904. &quot; Would you accept mentioning it or shall we not bother? I'm not sure the Echo is an expert on ghosts! â™¦ [[User:Dr. Blofeld|&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;color:#aba67e&quot;&gt;''Dr. Blofeld''&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:14, 8 April 2015 (UTC)

:: What I've read so far on supernatural South Wales has been utter crap. It's not a subject I take an interest in, although I have a few friends who take it very seriously. The trouble is that when you look at the details of the published works, lots of it just doesn't hang together. Gross geographical errors, anachronisms, just a plain lack of on the ground research. My favourite was the ghost haunting the Old Ferry Inn, Beachley, the ghost of the chap who was burned to death in the pier fire. Except that the pier fire was of the high wooden pier at Black Rock, Portskewett, not the low stone slipway at Beachley.

:This discussion should be treated as a continuation of ''[[Talk:Castell Coch#Where to mention Listed Building status?|Where to mention Listed Building status?]]'' above.

[[User:Verbcatcher|Verbcatcher]] ([[User talk:Verbcatcher|talk]]) 21:50, 16 April 2015 (UTC)
::I agree it is best to see this as a continuation of the earlier discussion.  I think this leads us to consensus that its listing sits best in the infobox.  As to the designation date, I personally think it '''is''' helpful; firstly, as a simple fact, secondly, as an indication of when the building's national importance was officially recognized and when it was afforded the legal protections that listed building status gives.  It also has some historic interest as a indication of changing tastes.  In the case of Coch, its listing in 1963 came quite late, 18 years before Burges's &quot;rehabilitation&quot; with the centenary exhibitions at Cardiff and the V&amp;A in 1981. For much of the twentieth century, like most of Burges's work, the Castle would generally have been viewed as a ridiculous sham.  In this regard, the much earlier listing date for [[The Tower House]] is interesting.  That said, it is not a deal-breaker for me, and if the consensus is to drop the date, I've very happy that we do so. [[User:KJP1|KJP1]] ([[User talk:KJP1|talk]]) 06:21, 17 April 2015 (UTC)
:::I'm with Verbcatcher on this one; I'd find it hard to imagine someone flicking through the article, looking at the infobox for the key bits of information, and expecting/needing to find the precise date of the listing.

:::KJP1's discussion of changing attitudes to Victorian architecture and design is interesting, and merits a place in this article if a suitable citation can be found, or in another article such as [[Victorian architecture]].
