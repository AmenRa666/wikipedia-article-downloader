== Not the Doc we knew...==

Wiki History is written by the victors, or in this case the people who didn't know the man.  He appears to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Nothing about him diverting Med Evac flights so he can land &quot;Ol' Triple 7&quot; or how we wasted the tax payer's money painting buildings which where slated for demo...  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.185.169.148|70.185.169.148]] ([[User talk:70.185.169.148|talk]]) 05:06, 19 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

This seems to be a biased entry for Foglesong, primarily a badly written PR piece, more than an actual biography.

&quot;Doc&quot; somehow trives on bad PR -- probably because he doesn't know any better.


No mention of his &quot;Combat Proud&quot; programs, or any of the other useless, embarrassing queep he made USAFE deal with?  Anyone who served under this man can attest to his total lack of 
leadership and bizarre fascination with himself, yet this bio reads like he's the best thing the USAF had since Robin Olds.  Is Doc editing his own Wiki page?

Doc probably is editing this stuff.  There was a blurb added in April this year (and promply removed SOMEHOW) by somebody who had also served under his &quot;leadership.&quot;  It talked about his idiot pet projects at Ramstein and throughout USAFE, especially his COMBAT beautification projects, how he wasted AF funding and resources by flying his own F-16, and how much he was lothed by the troops.

== 'common terms and phrases' ==

I removed them all:

&quot;Great Bulldog Nation&quot;

&quot;I fell in love with 480 knots.&quot;

&quot;One State, One Team&quot;

&quot;Check Six&quot;

&quot;Thanks for all you do&quot;

&quot;Hey, I just got done flying (insert aircraft)&quot;

&quot;That was a real nice thing, I'm not gonna lie to you.&quot;

&quot;L.T., you're fired&quot;.

Because they are not notable, and make the page read like a fanpage.  --[[User:Adam Brink|Adam Brink]] 15:03, 7 June 2007 (UTC)


I also cut out a whole bunch of non-notable stuff which I don't think has a place in an encyclopedia.  

''General Foglesong was also known throughout Europe for his &quot;Combat Proud&quot; program.  At Osan Air Base, Korea, during 1994, when he served as the Wing Commander, he implemented operation &quot;Wing Man,&quot; which included screenings of all-night movies at the base's movie theater during American holidays in order to comfort lonely service members who were unable to spend the holidays with their families.  

''During Foglesong's tenure as the commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe ([[USAFE]]), he was well known throughout the military communities located in Europe that had access to the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service [[AFRTS]] stations, better known as [[AFN]].  The primary reason for Foglesong's widespread reputation was the airing of television commercials intended to &quot;boost morale&quot; and promote virtue among members under Foglesong's command.  These airings, which were, and still are, well known and sometimes disliked by the majority of the individuals who were reluctantly exposed to them, were immediately discontinued as soon as Foglesong was replaced by his successor as commander of USAFE, General [[William T. Hobbins]].

''Foglesong spent 33 years in public service. He has received many awards for his leadership. In addition, he has continued his education by attending professional military education schools as well as advanced civilian education forums. He is a member of several professional aviation organizations and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. His 56 publications cover a range of subjects, including technical and leadership topics. A graduate of West Virginia University, Foglesong was a member of Tau Beta Pi (President), Ranking Engineer Honorary on campus; Mountain, Ranking Men’s Honorary on campus, and numbers of other academic and leadership honoraries.

''He had responsibility for policy recommendations and implementation of policy that affected personnel, operations, infrastructure, and intra/inter governmental affairs for an organization of 358,000 uniformed members and 158,000 civilian employees. He was responsible for planning and programming for future strategies involving an annual budget of $90 billion. During the last portion of his career, he had daily interaction with members of Congress, the White House, and various other government officials.''

None of it is referenced, much of it is not notable, all of it seems quite over-blown.

A section titled &quot;Strong Criticism From Rank and File Airmen&quot; has been added.  Feel free to insert some of your professional experiences you had under Foglesong's bizarre rule.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.181.220.120|68.181.220.120]] ([[User talk:68.181.220.120|talk]]) 08:19, 7 November 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I have again cut all of the assignments.  I strongly suspect that this article is being edited by General Foglesong.  The list of assignments is too detailed for what should be a short article about a fairly unimportant military functionary.

== Time at Mississippi State ==

I edited the page to include relevant information about how Dr. Foglesong's time at Mississippi State has been perceived by both students and faculty, which is quite negatively.  I cited this with 4 different pages, two of which are facebook groups composed almost entirely of Mississippi State students where they have voiced their concerns with Dr. Foglesong.  These changes were removed with the note that the citations did not provide support for the stated claims.  If the comments on the groups were read, anybody could see that many students are in fact quite dissatisfied with his &quot;leadership.&quot;  In addition to the two facebook groups, I also linked to two news articles about how the faculty dislike his leadership and I know that the claims I made about that were backed up by those articles.  I could change it back, but I don't feel like waging a war on wikipedia to make sure that the truth is heard.  If we could come to some consensus about this, I would prefer that.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/130.18.115.66|130.18.115.66]] ([[User talk:130.18.115.66|talk]]) 01:18, 24 February 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Whatever Ruby Hall resident. While it is understood that you have concerns about Robert Foglesong's actions, please remember, Wikipedia is not your livejournal. Don't use it merely as a tool to further your concerns about an individual or your opinions of somebody. It should only be used as a tool for pedagogical research.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/64.139.243.157|64.139.243.157]] ([[User talk:64.139.243.157|talk]]) 19:09, 25 February 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I do have concerns about his actions but the reason I want to include them on here is because it is relevant to an understanding of his time here at MSU.  I am not attempting to use this as my livejournal, I am merely attempting to make sure that there is an accurate representation of how he has performed his job.  Just as it is fitting to note how widely loved George Washington (or any other leader) was, just as it is fitting to include information about how well a person performed in a certain position, I feel it is fitting to include how Dr. Foglesong's time at MSU has been perceived by the students and faculty.[[Special:Contributions/130.18.115.66|130.18.115.66]] ([[User talk:130.18.115.66|talk]]) 01:31, 26 February 2008 (UTC)


Hi.  It would be nice if people signed in and signed their edits. (1) I am not that impressed by excerpting blogs and putting them in the article - that turns this into a popularity parade. If you can source statements properly you can use them.  Are there any sourced statements detailing his performance at MSU? (2) Foglesong is not really notable. He aint no George Washington... He is an ex-general who did two years as president (or whatever) at MSU.  We could just say that... --[[User:Adam Brink|Adam Brink]] ([[User talk:Adam Brink|talk]]) 10:29, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

It is now obvious Mr. Foglesong is editing his own page.  There is no mention of the CFR thing, yet it keeps reappearing.  Also, one link to a &quot;Forbes&quot; site is what he is using as proof he sits on those boards? I would expect to see websites of those corporations listing him holding a chair.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/131.53.128.33|131.53.128.33]] ([[User talk:131.53.128.33|talk]]) 22:20, 14 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== CFR ==

I have cut the following out:  

''==Council on Foreign Relations==
He is a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].''

I have found no evidence for it.  If you have some you can put it back.

--[[User:Adam Brink|Adam Brink]] ([[User talk:Adam Brink|talk]]) 10:06, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

He is mentioned nowhere on the CFR.org page.  Even the cit used to support his membership goes to the Wiki page on the CFR and he is not listed there.  Why is this still mentioned as though he is currently a member?  I have no way of knowing if he ever WAS a member of the CFR.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/131.53.128.33|131.53.128.33]] ([[User talk:131.53.128.33|talk]]) 14:55, 12 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I don't know why the CFR crap finds its way back in.

Like I said, if there is evidence for it, it can come back.  This article is oddly contentious.  I must say that I am also concerned that the subject of it is editing it.  It would help if everyone signed their posts... --[[User:Adam Brink|Adam Brink]] ([[User talk:Adam Brink|talk]]) 09:41, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

I am not a member, I just have firsthand knowledge of &quot;Doc&quot; and his personality.  Very much like him to be guilty of hyperbole.  If you take it out, he puts it back in. [[Special:Contributions/131.53.128.33|131.53.128.33]] ([[User talk:131.53.128.33|talk]]) 16:57, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

== non-notable 'notable achievements' ==

I have cut the following section out: ''Notable Accomplishments - While USAFE Commander, Gen Foglesong became famous for his Armed Forces Network morale building PSAs.  These PSAs used his now familiar catch phrase &quot;Don't forget get to...check your six.&quot;  These commercials were often filmed in front of his famous F-16 Fighting Falcon, nicknamed the &quot;Triple Nickel.&quot;''   That isn't notable...  Just to re-cap:  Foglesong himself is not very notable - he is one of a large number of generals that the US has generated in the last century.  If he merits an entry - and it is far from clear to me that he does - he merits a couple of sentences, nothing more.  Even if he was notable, what is mentioned about him here would be trivia, and should be cut for that reason as well.  --[[User:Adam Brink|Adam Brink]] ([[User talk:Adam Brink|talk]]) 15:21, 6 April 2009 (UTC)

''While at MSU, Foglesong provided numerous flyovers for Mississippi State Football games.  Foglesong flew a PT-17 Stearman (a biplane similar to a crop duster) for the first time in his life over MSU's game versus Kentucky on October, 28 2006.  Foglesong could occasionally be seen running wind sprints with the football team.  While at MSU, Foglesong also was the lead singer for the band, Bark.''  More trivia  --[[User:Adam Brink|Adam Brink]] ([[User talk:Adam Brink|talk]]) 17:35, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

I have removed this: ''While at USAFE his often erratic/egocentric behavior caused many in his direct chain of command to question the Air Force's ability to select and promote the most capable officers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flyingsquadron.com/forums/index.php?/topic/13965-the-foglesong-thread/&lt;/ref&gt;.{{When|date=May 2010}}''
