== &quot;the first series of modern battleships to be built.&quot; is ambiguous ==
The leading sentence to the article is &quot;The three Indiana-class battleships of the United States Navy were the first series of modern battleships to be built.&quot; Presumably this is to be built by the US Navy?
--[[User:Schwern|Schwern]] 16:46, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

== Limited endurance and coal capacity? ==
Citing Reilly and Scheina, the Indiana class had &quot;limited endurance and coal capacity&quot;. on page 68 however they give the steaming radius of the ships. At 10 knots they give radii (sp?) of 3720 naut. miles (BB-1), 4500 naut. miles (BB-2)and 5500 naut. miles (BB-3). While the first could be considered pretty limited, the second is comparable to the British Royal Sovereign and Majestic classes as well as the German Brandenburg class and the third is obviously superior.
This leaves me with two questions:
* Why is there such a big difference in steaming radius between three ships of the same class, considering they all have almost identical dimensions, displacement and maximum coal capacity (1600 tons which I can't compare to other data, but it doesn't seem really limited either)?
* If the steaming radii are correct, why do Reilly and Scheina refer to the entire class as having limited endurance instead of just BB-1, why don't they comment on this almost 2000 radius increase?

Any help with answering these questions or the name of a possible alternate source to check whether the data is correct would be greatly appreciated (DANFS and navsource.org don't have steaming radii). [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 16:42, 11 April 2010 (UTC)

:Perhaps &quot;limited endurance&quot; is relative. The Royal Sovereigns (1400 tons coal) would have had sufficient endurance for military operations from the UK to around the European seas, but for offensive operations the Indianas would need to steam much further eg in crossing the Pacific. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 19:01, 11 April 2010 (UTC)

:: Although a possibility, it doesn't shed any light on why the Oregon can go an additional 2000 miles compared to the Indiana. I did some further reading and the only other battleships commisioned pre 1900 with a radius over 5000 naut. miles seem to be the Centurion class, which are second class battleships specifically desigend for long range, and the Japanese ships, for which the numbers seem to be wrong (a captured Petropavlovsk of 3800 radius suddenly has a radius of 10000?). This would mean that in the 4 years after she was commisioned the Oregon would have the greatest endurance of any first class battleship on the planet, which just does not fit with the limited endurance thingy. My bet is that the 5500 number is simply wrong and perhaps the 4500 as well. Now I just have to find a reliable source to prove it. [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 23:59, 11 April 2010 (UTC)
:::One possibility: ''Oregon'' was built on the West Coast, and Friedman says on p. 27 that &quot;standard U.S. Navy contracts of this period allowed builders to propose alternatives to the official design.&quot; —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:05, 12 April 2010 (UTC)

:::: the following publication, or the one it refers to on the first page might shed some light on this, but my university doesn't seem to give online acces to the paper unfortunately. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122234045/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0#relatedArticles THE STEAMING RADIUS OF UNITED STATES NAVAL VESSELS]. Anybody have better luck? [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 13:48, 12 April 2010 (UTC)
::::: Nevermind, I got the article. Interesting stuff, seems the true steaming radius for all three vessels was 4500-5500 (at least in 1898) [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 15:40, 14 April 2010 (UTC)

== ''Scientific American'' as ref 2 ==
Hello there, thanks for your work here. I see that your books cites a ''Scientific American'' article in ref 2 here. Do they give a page number? If so, I'll go and take a look at it, as my university's library has (I think) every issue ever published. Regards, —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:32, 12 April 2010 (UTC)
: Cheers, The page number is 93 from issue 74, dated 8 may 1896 [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 08:42, 12 April 2010 (UTC)
::Okay, I'll go hunt this down as soon as I can. —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 02:49, 14 April 2010 (UTC)

== DYK ==
The prose has been expanded more than 5x; does anyone want to nominate this at [[T:TDYK]]? —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:14, 12 April 2010 (UTC)
: hmm, I looked at it, but I still have no idea how it works and why you would participate. Feel free if you want to nominate, but I don't understand it. [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 08:59, 12 April 2010 (UTC)

== Price of the Indianas ==
I saw the price for the Indiana's was given at 3 million dollar with a source. Are you absolutely certain that this is correct?
Reilly &amp; Scheine give the exact total costs for each ship down to the dollarcent and these are around 6 million (6,5 for Oregon). Now they either dreamed those up or the other source is incorrect (perhaps projected costs vs actual cost?) [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 11:31, 12 April 2010 (UTC)
:If R&amp;S say different, by all means use them, they're more reliable and are way more recent. —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 02:48, 14 April 2010 (UTC)

== in, -inch or inches? ==
As the header says, which do we use? I don't really care either way, but right now all three styles are used in the article. For the infobox I suggest we stick with the shortest abbreviation, but otherwise I will follow any guideline. [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 20:28, 12 April 2010 (UTC)
:A combination of -inch and inches, depending on its grammatical context (adjective or not) —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 02:47, 14 April 2010 (UTC)

== too much text directly takem from DANFS? ==
eg &quot;With the outbreak of World War II, it was deemed that the scrap value of the ship was necessary.... to the war effort and she was sold &quot;. I think we can paraphrase or rewrite more. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 18:13, 17 April 2010 (UTC)
: You are no doubt correct. In fact the entire section is just a trimmed copy of the DANFS article (gotta love public domain text) I will have another look at it soon [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 20:29, 17 April 2010 (UTC)
::Thought: if you want to get this to FA, ''all'' of that text will hvae to be reworded/paraphrased or it will fail, I guarantee it. :\ —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 08:41, 19 April 2010 (UTC)
::: I plan on getting the individual ship articles up to GA class before I make a nomination for a FA (if I do at all) and rewrite the sections here once I have done the corresponding article. But what about GA-class, would the article fail that assessment on this point? [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 09:00, 19 April 2010 (UTC)
::::Consensus on [[WT:MHCOORD]] seemed to lean towards A-class and higher, so no&amp;mdash;but it depends on the individual GA reviewer as well. —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 09:09, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

== Incorrect Photographic Caption ==
The sub-entry for the Indiana has a photograph claiming to depict the ship at the Colombian Exposition in Chicago. It must be a picture of the mock-up &quot;USS Illinois&quot; instead, since the &quot;Illinois&quot; was specifically designed and built for display at the expo. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/130.74.92.193|130.74.92.193]] ([[User talk:130.74.92.193|talk]]) 22:20, 22 April 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
: Ah! that explains it. I was wondering last night how the ''Indiana'' could be present there in 1893, when it was not commissioned until two years later.

== Notes ==
*There's one &quot;the Indiana&quot; (in the endsections) and at least one &quot;the Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;the Oregon&quot;. These don't bother me because that language is common in our sources (Garzke &amp; Dulin for instance) and in general, but a lot of SHIPS people like to be consistent ... up to you. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 04:02, 31 May 2010 (UTC)
** I will have a look through
*I'm not following &quot;this was not seen as a great compromise&quot;. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 04:25, 31 May 2010 (UTC)
** The sentence is referring to using slow firing 6 inch guns instead of RF 5 inch guns as originally intended. Compromise is probably not the right term, something on the order of &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;solution&quot; is probably better.
*Were eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers installed on ''Massachusetts'' and eight on ''Indiana''? If there were eight total, how many went to one ship and how many to the other? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 02:19, 1 June 2010 (UTC)
** Eight each. keep in mind a [[Scotch_marine_boiler#Double-ended|double ended Scotch boiler]] are in fact two boilers placed back to back.
*It seems a little strange to me that ''Indiana'' was sunk and then sold for scrap, do you have any sources other than DANFS that mention that? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 02:33, 1 June 2010 (UTC)
** Keep in mind she was sunk in very shallow waters. In this picture [[:File:Indiana bombing 1920.jpg]] she is resting on the bottom. If you want more sources: Reilly and Scheina mention the scrapping and I can dig up a New york times article with the exact price as well. [[User:Yoenit|Yoenit]] ([[User talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 06:35, 1 June 2010 (UTC)
***Not a problem, I'll make a small edit so that the reader doesn't take &quot;sunk&quot; the wrong way. Everything looks good now. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 13:53, 1 June 2010 (UTC)
