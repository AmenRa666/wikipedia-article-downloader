The '''575th Air Defense Group'''  is a disbanded [[United States Air Force]] organization. Its last assignment was with the [[4708th Air Defense Wing]] at [[Selfridge Air Force Base]], Michigan, where it was inactivated in 1955.  The [[group (military aviation unit)|group]] was originally activated as a support unit for the [[4th Fighter Group]] after the 4th returned to the US at the end of [[World War II]] and performed that mission until it was inactivated in 1947.

The group was activated once again in 1952 to replace the support elements of the inactivating [[56th Fighter-Interceptor Wing]].  A year later ADC established it as an operational headquarters for [[interceptor aircraft|fighter-interceptor]] squadrons as well.  It was replaced in 1955 when ADC transferred its mission, equipment, and personnel to the [[1st Fighter Group]] in a project that replaced air defense groups commanding fighter squadrons with fighter groups with distinguished records during World War II.

==History==

===Strategic Air Command===
The [[Group (military aviation unit)|group]] was activated in 1946 as the '''575th Air Service Group''' to support the [[4th Fighter Group]]&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9623 |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 4 Operations Group (ACC)|date=2011-08-22|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|deadurl=no |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Selfridge Field]], Michigan.  Its 1044th Air Engineering Squadron provided maintenance that was beyond the capability of the fighter group, its 1054th Air Materiel Squadron handled all supply matters, and its Headquarters &amp; Base Services Squadron provided other support.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  The group transferred to [[Andrews Field]], Maryland, where it was inactivated in August 1947 and its personnel and equipment were transferred to the 4th Airdrome Group, which assumed its mission under the experimental [[Hobson Plan|wing base reorganization]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Mueller, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  It was disbanded in October 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Air Force Letter, 322 (AFOOR 887e), 8 October 1948, Subject: Disbandment of Certain Inactive Air Force Units&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air Defense Command===
[[File:172d Fighter Squadron - North American P-51D-25-NA Mustang 44-73227.jpg|thumb|F-51D of the 172d FIS&lt;ref group=note&gt;On 1 November 1952 the [[172d Fighter Squadron|172d FIS]] was returned to the control of the [[Michigan Air National Guard]].  Its F-51s were transferred to the newly-activated 431st FIS, which continued to fly them until converting to Sabres in May 1953&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The group was reconstituted, redesignated as the '''575th Air Base Group''', and activated at Selfridge in 1952&lt;ref name=&quot;cj 85&quot;&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; in a major reorganization of [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC) responding to ADC's difficulty under the existing wing base organizational structure in deploying fighter squadrons to best advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  It replaced the 56th Air Base Group as the USAF host unit for Selfridge.  The group was assigned seven [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s to perform its support responsibilities.&lt;ref name=cj134&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cj152&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=575foodsvcsq&gt;''See'' [http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/421/750.xml Abstract, History of 575th Food Service Squadron, Feb-Mar 1952] (accessed 17 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=575mtrvehsq&gt;''See'' [http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/427/260.xml Abstract, History of 575th Motor Vehicle Squadron, Apr-Jun 1952] (accessed 17 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=575splysq&gt;''See'' [http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/418/956.xml Abstract, History of 575th Supply Squadron, Feb-Jun 1952] (accessed 17 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  It also maintained aircraft stationed at Selfridge.&lt;ref name=cj142&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson pp.142&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron - Lockheed F-94B-1-LO Starfire 50-0888.jpg|thumb|left|F-94B of the 61st FIS]]
The group was redesignated as the '''575th Air Defense Group''' in 1953&lt;ref name=&quot;cj 85&quot;/&gt; and assumed responsibility for air defense of the upper Great Lakes area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  It was assigned the [[56th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] (FIS), flying single seat [[North American F-86 Sabre]] aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; the [[61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron|61st FIS]], flying two-seat [[Lockheed F-94 Starfire]] aircraft, armed with 20mm cannon,&lt;ref name=&quot;cj 117&quot;&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[431st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron|431st FIS]], flying [[World War II]] era [[North American F-51 Mustang]] aircraft&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p.128&quot;&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[4708th Defense Wing]] as its operational elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;M CS 227&quot;&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M CS 237&quot;&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M CS 532&quot;&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 532-533&lt;/ref&gt;  The three squadrons were already stationed at Selfridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;M CS 227&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M CS 237&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M CS 532&quot;/&gt; In May 1953, the 431st FIS converted to Sabres&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p.128&quot;/&gt; and the following month moved to Libya and was assigned away from the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;M CS 532&quot;/&gt;  Meanwhile, in April 1953, the [[13th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron|13th FIS]], flying a newer [[fire control radar|radar]] equipped and [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|Mighty Mouse rocket]] armed model of the F-86 aircraft&lt;ref&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; was activated as a fourth operational squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p.73&lt;/ref&gt;  In July the 56th FIS upgraded to newer radar equipped &quot;Sabres,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cj 117&quot;/&gt; so that when the 61st FIS moved to Newfoundland and was transferred out of the group in August,&lt;ref name=&quot;M CS 237&quot;/&gt; all squadrons of the 575th were flying the same aircraft, the F-86D, for the first time.  In September, the group's medical squadron responsibility expanded when the nearby Percy Jones Army Hospital closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/407/180.xml Abstract, History of 575th Medical Squadron, Jul-Dec 1953] (accessed 17 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was inactivated&lt;ref name=&quot;cj 85&quot;/&gt; and replaced by [[1st Fighter Group]] (Air Defense) in 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II|origyear=1961|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/af_combat_units_wwii.pdf |edition=reprint|year=1983|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn = 0-912799-02-1|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of [[Air Defense Command]]'s Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, Sturm, Volan, &amp; McMullen, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  It was disbanded again in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 575q, 27 Sep 1984, Subject: Disbandment of Units&lt;/ref&gt;
