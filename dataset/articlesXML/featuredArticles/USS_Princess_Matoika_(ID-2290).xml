'''USS ''Princess Matoika'' (ID-2290)''' was a transport ship for the [[United States Navy]] during World War I. Before the war, she was a {{sclass|Barbarossa|ocean liner}} that sailed as '''SS ''Kiautschou''''' for the [[Hamburg America Line]] and as '''SS ''Princess Alice''''' (sometimes spelled '''''Prinzess Alice''''') for [[North German Lloyd]]. After her World War I Navy service ended, she served as the [[United States Army]] transport ship '''USAT ''Princess Matoika'''''. In post-war civilian service she was '''SS ''Princess Matoika''''' until 1922, '''SS ''President Arthur''''' until 1927, and '''SS ''City of Honolulu''''' until she was scrapped in 1933.

Built in 1900 for the [[German Empire|German]] Far East mail routes, SS ''Kiautschou'' traveled between Hamburg and Far East ports for most of her Hamburg America Line career. In 1904, she was traded to competitor North German Lloyd for five [[cargo ship|freighters]], and renamed SS ''Princess Alice''. She sailed both transatlantic and Far East mail routes until the outbreak of World War I, when she was interned in the neutral port of [[Cebu City|Cebu]] in the [[Philippines]]. Seized by the U.S. in 1917, the newly renamed USS ''Princess Matoika'' carried over 50,000&amp;nbsp;U.S. troops to and from France in U.S. Navy service from 1918 to 1919. As an Army transport after that, she continued to return troops and repatriated the remains of Americans killed overseas in the war. In July 1920, she was a last-minute substitute to carry a large portion of the United States team to the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp. From the perspective of the Olympic team, the trip was disastrous and a majority of the team members published a list of grievances and demands of the [[United States Olympic Committee|American Olympic Committee]] in an action known today as the [[Mutiny of the Matoika|Mutiny of the ''Matoika'']].

After her Army career ended, ''Princess Matoika'' was transferred to the [[United States Mail Steamship Line]] for European passenger service in early 1921. After that company's financial troubles resulted in her seizure, ''Princess Matoika'' was assigned to the newly formed [[United States Lines]] and resumed passenger service. In 1922, the ship was renamed SS ''President Arthur'', in honor of the 21st [[List of Presidents of the United States|U.S. President]], [[Chester A. Arthur]]. When changes in U.S. laws severely curtailed the number of immigrants that could enter the country in the early 1920s, the ship was laid up in [[Baltimore]] in late 1923.

''President Arthur'' was purchased in October 1924 by the Jewish-owned [[American Palestine Line]] to begin regular service between New York, [[Naples]], and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. On her maiden voyage to Palestine, she reportedly became the first ocean liner to fly the [[Flag of Israel|Zionist flag]] at sea and the first ocean liner ever to have female officers. Financial difficulties for American Palestine ended the service after three roundtrips, and the liner was sold to the [[Los Angeles Steamship Company]] for Los Angeles–[[Honolulu]] service. Following three years of carrying tourists and freight, the liner burned in [[Honolulu Harbor]] in 1930. She was deemed too expensive to repair and was eventually scrapped in Japan in 1933.

== Hamburg America Line ==
In March 1900 the {{HAPAG|first=long}} announced the plans for 22 new ships totaling {{GRT|150,000|disp=long}} at a cost of $11,000,000. One of the two largest ships announced was SS ''Kiautschou'' at an announced {{GRT|10,200}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9C02E0DE1E3CE433A25756C2A9659C946197D6CF |format=pdf |title=Hamburg-American fleet |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=25 March 1900 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was [[Keel laying|laid down]] at [[AG Vulcan Stettin]] in [[Stettin]], Germany (present-day [[Szczecin]], Poland).&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 /&gt; During her construction, {{HAPAG}} renamed the ship twice before finally settling on [[Kiautschou]], the German colony in China, as her namesake.&lt;ref&gt;Bonsor (Vol. 1, p. 408) identifies the two names as ''Borussia'' and ''Teutonia'', while Drechsel (Vol. 1, p. 338) gives them as ''Bavaria'' and ''Teutonia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Built, along with sister ship {{SS|Hamburg||2}}, for {{HAPAG}}'s entry into the [[Reichspost#Deutsche Reichspost|Deutsche Reichspost's]] Far East routes, ''Kiautschou'' was launched on 14&amp;nbsp;September 1900, and sailed on her maiden voyage from [[Hamburg]] to the Far East on 22&amp;nbsp;December 1900.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v1-408&gt;Bonsor, Vol. 1, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was {{convert|525|ft|m}} long and featured twin screws powered by two [[quadruple expansion]] [[steam engine]]s that generated {{convert|9000|hp}}. The liner also featured [[bilge keel]]s that helped stabilize her ride. On the interior, ''Kiautschou''{{'}}s first-class [[state room]]s were described as &quot;light and large&quot; and located in the center of the ship. She had two large [[promenade deck]]s, a music room, and a library. Her [[smoking room]] was at the rear of the upper promenade deck, and her large dining room featured a balcony where the ship's orchestra could serenade diners.&lt;ref name=NYT-1904-04-06&gt;{{cite news |title=Luncheon on a liner |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 April 1904 |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kiautschou'' sailed on the Hamburg–Far East route until May 1902. For one round trip that month, ''Kiautschou'' replaced fellow {{HAPAG}} steamer {{SS|Deutschland|1900|2}} on Hamburg–New York service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamburg America... |type=display ad |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 May 1902 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling at [[Southampton]] and [[Cherbourg]] on her eastbound trip,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shipping and Foreign Mails |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 May 1902 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Cherbourg and [[Plymouth]] on her westbound return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shipping and Foreign Mails |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=24 May 1902 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this one transatlantic excursion, ''Kiautschou'' was returned to Hamburg–Far East service.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v1-408 /&gt; On 20 February 1904, in exchange for abandoning the mail routes shared with [[North German Lloyd]], {{HAPAG}} traded ''Kiautschou'' for Lloyd [[cargo ship|freighters]] ''Bamberg'', ''Königsberg'', ''Nürnberg'', ''Stolberg'', and ''Strassburg''.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 /&gt;

== North German Lloyd ==
North German Lloyd renamed the newly acquired ship ''Princess Alice'',&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-566 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 /&gt; though the German spelling ''Prinzess Alice'' was widely used in contemporary press coverage and, often, by the Lloyd themselves.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 /&gt; There is some confusion as to who exactly was the namesake of the ship. Edwin Drechsel, in his two-volume work ''Norddeutscher Lloyd, Bremen, 1857–1970'', reports that the ship was named equally for [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone|Princess Alice of Albany]] and [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Alice Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 /&gt; Princess Alice of Albany was a granddaughter of [[Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom]], and the new bride of [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Prince Alexander]] of [[Teck]] in [[Württemberg]].&lt;ref name=Eilers-215&gt;Eilers, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Alice Roosevelt, daughter of the then-current U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], was nicknamed &quot;Princess Alice&quot; by the press, and had [[ship naming and launching|launched]] the racing yacht of [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], ''Meteor'', at [[Staten Island]] two years before.&lt;ref&gt;Drechsel, Vol. 1, p. 261. Alice Roosevelt had been further honored by the German Empire by the March 1902 renaming of former [[torpedo boat]] ''D2'' to ''Alice Roosevelt''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Lowell Putnam]] gives the namesake as [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], the daughter of Queen Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, p. 145. Putnam states further that [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]] was the wife of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Kaiser Freidrich III]], apparently confusing Alice with her sister [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The-Princesses-Alice.jpg|thumb|left|SS ''Princess Alice'' was named for one or more of these Princesses Alice (from left): [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone|Princess Alice of Albany]], [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|&quot;Princess&quot; Alice Roosevelt]].]]
''Princess Alice'' departed her new homeport of [[Bremen]] on 22&amp;nbsp;March 1904 for her maiden voyage under her new owners.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-566 /&gt; After arriving in New York draped in flags and bunting, her dining room was the site of a press luncheon thrown by Lloyd staff celebrating her first arrival in that city.&lt;ref name=NYT-1904-04-06 /&gt; ''Princess Alice'' made four more roundtrips through early August, then shifted to Bremen–[[Suez Canal]]–Far East service, making her first Lloyd voyage on that route 31&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v1-408 /&gt; ''Princess Alice'' would continue this pattern—sailing the North Atlantic during the heaviest-trafficked season and shifting to the Far East runs for the balance of the year—through 1910.&lt;ref name=NYT-1904-04-06 /&gt;&lt;!-- description of seasonal plans --&gt;&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /&gt;&lt;!-- through 1910 --&gt;

Throughout the rest of her Lloyd North Atlantic career she carried some notable passengers to and from Europe. In May 1905, for example, noted Baltimore [[gynecologist]] [[Howard Atwood Kelly]], one of the co-founders of [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], sailed from New York;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Town &amp; Country Calendar: Arrivals and Departures | journal = [[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]] | date = 27 May 1905 | volume = 3080 | pages = 6 | location = New York | publisher = Stuyvesant | issn = 0040-9952 | oclc =5878257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Hamilton Wright Mabie]] and his wife sailed from New York the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Town &amp; Country Calendar: Arrivals and Departures | journal = Town &amp; Country | date = 8 July 1905 | volume = 3086 | pages = 3 | location = New York | publisher = Stuyvesant |  issn = 0040-9952 | oclc =5878257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 760905912 (3) --&gt; American botanist [[Charles Frederick Millspaugh]] returned to New York aboard the German liner in June 1906,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ocean travelers |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=20 June 1906 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and retired U.S. Navy [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear admiral]] [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] did the same in June 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Rear Admiral Mahan returns |work=The Washington Post | date = 21 June 1907 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Augustus Octavius Bacon|Augustus O.

Prompted by the successful use of [[radio|wireless]] in saving lives during the sinking of {{RMS|Republic|1903|6}} in January 1909, and by proposed U.S. legislation (later passed as the [[Wireless Ship Act of 1910]]) requiring wireless for ships calling at U.S. ports, ''Princess Alice'' received her first wireless set in February 1909.&lt;ref name=NYT-1909-02-12&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9803E6DC153EE733A25751C1A9649C946897D6CF |format=pdf |title=Wireless on more ships |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=12 February 1909 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, p. 690.&lt;!-- wireless act provision --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Operating with call letters &quot;DKZ&quot; on the 300&amp;nbsp;m band, her radio had a {{convert|250|mi|km|adj=on}} range.&lt;ref name=&quot;wireless&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://earlyradiohistory.us/1909stat.htm |author=[[United States Navy|Navy Department]], Bureau of Equipment |title=List of Wireless Telegraph Stations of the World |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher= U.S. Government Printing Office |chapter=List of Merchant Steamers and Private Yachts |chapterurl=http://earlyradiohistory.us/1909stat.htm#vesselsworld |date=1 September 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 10:00 on 27 May 1909, loaded with over 1,000&amp;nbsp;passengers headed for Europe, ''Princess Alice'' departed the Lloyd pier in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], New Jersey. As she neared [[The Narrows]] in a heavy fog, she steamed to stay clear of outbound [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique|French Line]] steamer {{SS|La Bretagne||2}} and ran hard aground on a submerged rocky ledge near the [[seawall]] of [[Fort Wadsworth]] a few minutes after 11:00.&lt;ref name=NYT-1909-05-28&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D04EEDD1E31E733A2575BC2A9639C946897D6CF |format=pdf |title=The Prinzess Alice aground in the bay |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 May 1909 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-1909-05-29&gt;&lt;!-- time of grounding --&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9902E5D6153EE733A2575AC2A9639C946897D6CF |format=pdf |title=Prinzess Alice sails |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 May 1909 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fog lifted, it was revealed that the bow of ''Princess Alice'' had stopped some {{convert|5|ft|m|1}} from the outer walls of the Staten Island fort. [[Lighthouse tender]] ''Larkspur'' was the first ship to come to the aid of the ''Princess'', followed by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[United States Army Quartermaster Corps|Quartermaster's ship]] ''General Meigs''&lt;!-- not USAT Meigs or USS General M.

In May 1910, ''Princess Alice'' sailed her last North Atlantic passage for her German owners.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /&gt; Put permanently on the Far East route, she plied Pacific waters for North German Lloyd until the outbreak of World War I. In late July 1914, as war spread across Europe, ''Princess Alice'' neared her destination of Hong Kong with £850,000 of gold from [[India]]. Rather than face seizure of the ship and her cargo by British authorities there, ''Princess Alice'' instead sped to the [[Philippines]] and deposited the gold with the German Consul at [[Manila]]. Leaving the neutral port in under 24&amp;nbsp;hours, the ship then rendezvoused with German [[cruiser]] {{SMS|Emden|1906|2}} at [[Angaur]] before returning to the Philippines in early August and putting in at [[Cebu City|Cebu]] where she was interned.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 /&gt;

On the morning of 16&amp;nbsp;June, lookouts on ''Princess Matoika'' spotted a submarine and, soon after, a torpedo heading directly for the ship.

In the next months, ''Princess Matoika'' successfully completed two additional roundtrips from Newport News.

=== Returning troops home ===
With the fighting at an end, the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately.&lt;ref name=Gleaves-31&gt;Gleaves, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Princess Matoika'' did her part by carrying home 30,110 healthy and wounded men in eight roundtrips.&lt;ref name=Gleaves-248-49 /&gt; On 20&amp;nbsp;December, 3,000&amp;nbsp;troops boarded her and departed France for Newport News, arriving there on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1919.&lt;ref name=WP-1919-01-02&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Associated Press]] | title = Matoika lands 3,000 | work = The Washington Post | date = 2 January 1919 | page = 4 }}&lt;!--Arrival date, updated wounded tally--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP-1918-12-25&gt;{{cite news | title = Transport with 3,000 due at Newport News January 2 | work = The Washington Post | date = 25 December 1918 | page = 4 }}&lt;!-- departure date, units, Menoher--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Among those carried were [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Charles T.

{{Main article|Mutiny of the Matoika}}

Beginning 26 July 1920, a majority of the U.S. Olympic contingent destined for the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp, Belgium, endured a troubled transatlantic journey aboard ''Princess Matoika''. The voyage and the events onboard—later called the &quot;Mutiny of the ''Matoika'' &lt;!--&quot;thin space&quot; to prevent clash of italics with quotes--&gt;&quot;—were still being discussed in the popular press years later. The ''Matoika'' was a last-minute substitute for another ship and, according to the athletes, did not have adequate accommodations or training facilities on board.&lt;ref name=Findling&gt;Findling and Pelle, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the voyage, the athletes published a list of grievances and demands and distributed copies of the document to the [[United States Secretary of War]], the [[United States Olympic Committee|American Olympic Committee]] members, and the press.&lt;ref name=NYT-1920-08-08&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F00E1DF1639E133A2575BC0A96E9C946195D6CF |format=pdf |title=Officials blamed by U.S. athletes |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 August 1920 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident received wide coverage in American newspapers at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B0DE6DD1339E133A25754C1A9629C946395D6CF |format=pdf |title=Colleges to fight A.A.U., says Fuessle |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 April 1922 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Mail Line ==
At the conclusion of her Army service, ''Princess Matoika'' was handed over to the {{USSB|first=long}}, who chartered the vessel to the [[United States Mail Steamship Company]] for service from New York to [[Italy]]. This solution of how to use the ''Princess'' for civilian service was the culmination of efforts by the {{USSB}} to find a suitable civilian use for her. In 1919, she was one of the ships suggested for a proposed service from [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, to [[Valparaiso]], Chile,&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;McIntosh, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 1919, tentative plans were announced for her service with the [[Munson Line]] between New York and [[Argentina]] beginning in mid-1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Two ships for Argentina | work = The Washington Post | date = 8 November 1919 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but both of these proposals fell through.

''Princess Matoika''—outfitted for 350&amp;nbsp;cabin-class and 500&amp;nbsp;third-class passengers and at {{GRT|10,421|disp=long}}—kicked off her U.S. Mail Line service on 20 January 1921 when she sailed from New York to [[Naples]] and [[Genoa]] on her first of three roundtrips between these ports.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /&gt; After a storm damaged the ''Matoika''{{'}}s steering gear, she had to be towed back in to New York on 28&amp;nbsp;January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Imperial and foreign news items |work=The Times  | date = 1 February 1921 | page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After repairs and a successful eastbound crossing, ''Princess Matoika'' had an encounter with an [[iceberg]] off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] while carrying some 2,000&amp;nbsp;Italian immigrants on her first return trip from Italy. On the night of 24&amp;nbsp;February, the fully laden ship struck what was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as either &quot;an iceberg or a submerged wreck&quot; off [[Cape Race]]. The ship's steering gear was damaged in the collision, leaving the ship adrift for over seven hours before repairs were effected. The ''Matoika''{{'}}s captain indicated that no passengers were hurt in the collision.&lt;ref name=NYT-1920-02-27&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A07E7DC113FE432A25754C2A9649C946095D6CF |format=pdf |title=Liner, with 2,000 passengers, hits iceberg and drifts helplessly at sea seven hours |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=27 February 1921 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the story of one third-class passenger, she, suspecting there was something seriously amiss, made inquiry after the commotion. A crew member told her that the ''Matoika'' had only stopped to greet a ship passing in the night. When she went on deck, insistent on seeing the other ship herself, she saw the iceberg and observed the first-class passengers queued up to board the already-lowered [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. She took her daughter with her to join one of the queues, and, though initially rebuffed, was allowed to remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sea of Memories: Princess Matoika |url=http://www.maritimematters.com/princess-matoika-seamemory.html |website=Maritime Matters: Ocean liner history and cruise ship news |publisher=Martin Cox |date=December 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524185211/http://www.maritimematters.com/princess-matoika-seamemory.html |archivedate=24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lifeboats were never deployed, however, and the ''Matoika'' arrived in Boston, where she had been diverted due to a [[typhus]] scare,&lt;ref name=NYT-1920-02-27/&gt; on 28&amp;nbsp;February without further incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Immigrants arrive | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 1 March 1921 | page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her withdrawal from the Italian route, ''Princess Matoika'' was transferred to New York–Bremen service, sailing on her first commercial trip to Germany since before World War I on 14&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /&gt; In July, during her second roundtrip on the Bremen route,&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /&gt; late rental payments to the {{USSB}} resulted in action to seize the nine ships chartered by the U.S. Mail Line, including the ''Matoika'', after its return from Bremen.

== United States Lines ==
Upon the formation of the United States Lines in August 1921, ''Princess Matoika'' and the eight other ex-German liners formerly operated by the U.S. Mail Line were transferred to the new company for operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = United States Lines will operate passenger vessels |work=The Wall Street Journal | date = 30 August 1921 | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Princess'', still on New York–Bremen service, sailed on her first voyage for the new steamship line on 15&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /&gt; In October, ''Matoika'' crewmen were reported as taking advantage of the [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|German inflation]] by consuming champagne available for $1.00 per quart and mugs of &quot;the best beer&quot; for an American penny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Champagne and beer add joys to U.S. sailor's life | work = Chicago Daily Tribune | date = 17 October 1921 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, United States Lines announced that ''Princess Matoika'' would be replaced on the Bremen route in order to better compete with [[North German Lloyd]], the liner's former owner, but that never came about.&lt;!-- See Bonsor for continuation of Bremen service --&gt;&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = To build up Atlantic service | work = The Wall Street Journal | date = 8 November 1921 | page = 3 }}&lt;!-- announcement--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Princess'' continued on runs to Bremen, calling at the additional ports of [[Cobh|Queenstown]], [[Southampton]], and [[Danzig]], as her schedule shifted from time to time.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /&gt;

On 28 January 1922, the ''Matoika'' departed with 400&amp;nbsp;passengers, among them, 312&amp;nbsp;[[Poland|Polish]] orphans headed for repatriation in their homeland.&lt;ref name = WP-1922-01-31/&gt; Two days and {{convert|100|nmi|km}} out of New York, the liner experienced a heavy [[gale]] that disabled her steering gear, and forced her return to New York after temporary repairs failed.&lt;ref name=WP-1922-01-31&gt;{{cite news | title = Matoika, 312 orphans aboard, limps to port | work = The Washington Post | date = 31 January 1922 | page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The captain was able to steer her through the use of the ship's engines,&lt;ref name=WP-1922-01-31 /&gt; and arrived safely back in port on 31&amp;nbsp;January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D06EEDA1130EE3ABC4953DFB4668389639EDE |format=pdf |title=Damaged ship returns |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 February 1922 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was the yet another misfortune that had befallen the young Poles. After being orphaned by the fighting between Polish and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces, the orphans had been taken across [[Siberia]], evacuated to Japan, transported to [[Seattle]], Washington, and taken by rail to Chicago, Illinois, where they were enrolled in school while searches for relatives in Poland were conducted.&lt;ref name=WP-1922-01-22&gt;{{cite news | title = Polish orphans going home | work = The Washington Post | date = 22 January 1922 | page = 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chester A Arthur by Daniel Huntington.jpeg|left|thumb|upright|[[Chester A. Arthur]], the 21st [[List of Presidents of the United States|U.S. President]], was the namesake for ''President Arthur'']]
After four Bremen roundtrips for United States Lines, ''Princess Matoika'' had sailed her last voyage under that name.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /&gt; When newly built Type&amp;nbsp;535 vessels named for American presidents came into service for the company in May 1922, the ''Princess'' was renamed SS ''President Arthur'' in honor of the 21st [[List of Presidents of the United States|U.S. President]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], matching the naming style of the new ships.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-339&gt;Drechsel, Vol. 1, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

After her rename, she continued plying the North Atlantic between New York and Bremen, and was involved in a few episodes of note during this time. In June 1922, two years into [[Prohibition in the United States]], ''President Arthur'' was raided while at her dock in Hoboken, New Jersey, which netted 150&amp;nbsp;cases of smuggled spirits. Officials involved denied reports that the raid was conducted as a legal [[Test case (law)|test case]] intended to test the determination of {{USSB}} chair [[Albert Lasker]] that United States-flagged ships could carry and sell alcohol outside the [[three-mile limit|three-mile territorial limit]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Associated Press]] | title = American ships raided | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 28 June 1922 | page = I-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[James A. Gallivan]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Massachusetts|MA]]), an anti-prohibition leader, publicly demanded to know why the ship had not been seized for violating U.S. laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A01E0D71231EF33A2575AC2A9609C946395D6CF |format=pdf |title=Fight on 'wet' ships laid to foreigners |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 June 1922 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, ''President Arthur'' carried [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] Muriel MacSwiney, widow of the recently deceased [[Lord Mayor of Cork]] [[Terence MacSwiney]], and Linda Mary Kearns, who had been jailed for murder under the [[Black and Tans]], to New York. Wearing buttons with pictures of [[Harry Boland]], an anti-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|treaty]] Irish nationalist who had been killed the previous month, the two women were there to raise funds for orphans of [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Anti-Treaty IRA]] forces, who were then fighting in southern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Finance Collins killers | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 7 September 1922 | page = I-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, a Hoboken man, after securing a last-minute [[court order]], was able to halt the deportation of his German niece on ''President Arthur''; she was retrieved from the ship ten minutes before sailing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9506E1DC1139E133A25750C1A9669D946395D6CF |format=pdf |title=Halts girl's deportation |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 October 1922 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1922, U.S. Customs Service agents, seized a cache of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] guns aboard ''President Arthur''. The entire crew was questioned but all denied any knowledge of the eight weapons found stowed behind a [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A02EFDD1638EF3ABC4052DFB7678389639EDE |format=pdf |title=Find 8 magazine guns hidden in liner's hold |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=18 November 1922 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August the following year, ''President Arthur'' took on board a seaman suffering from [[pneumonia]] from the [[Norway|Norwegian]] freighter ''Eastern Star'' in a mid-ocean transfer.

The dining room, large enough to seat 300 in a single sitting, was decorated in a [[Greek Revival architecture|Grecian]] theme,&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-05-15 /&gt; and featured 18&amp;nbsp;[[stained glass window]]s designed by San Diego architect [[Carleton Winslow]].&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-06-04&gt;{{cite news | title = Ocean palace to sail today | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 4 June 1927 | page = A1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[smoking room]] was done up in a [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor style]]; the music room was decorated in a combined [[Second Empire (architecture)|French]] and [[Italianate architecture|Italian]] Renaissance manner; and the writing room was in [[Adam style]]. The [[suite (hotel)|suites]] were all done in either Adam, [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]], or [[Louis XVI style|Louis XVI]] styles.&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-05-15 /&gt; The ship featured six passenger elevators,&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-06-04 /&gt; and a swimming pool patterned on a [[Pompei]]an design. One of the few remaining traces of her pre-war German decoration was the [[rosewood]] railing on her grand staircase.&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-06-04 /&gt;

On 4 June 1927, a crowd of 7,000 well-wishers saw ''City of Honolulu'' depart on her maiden voyage. The festivities were also broadcast on radio station KGFO,&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-06-05&gt;{{cite news | title = Palatial liner off on voyage | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 5 June 1927 | page = B5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a portable station operating form the front cargo deck of the ship. During the journey, broadcasts of the ''City of Honolulu''{{'}}s orchestra, along with radio personalities and musicians from Los Angeles station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]], entertained both passengers and listeners on shore (while the ship was in range).&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-06-26&gt;{{cite news | title = Broadcast programs in mid-Pacific | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 26 June 1927 | page = B6 }} Brant Radio Power Co., the owners of KGFO, were granted special permission from the [[Federal Radio Commission]] to transmit from their broadcast truck aboard the ship while at sea, and while ashore at Hawaii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several notable passengers sailed on the liner's maiden voyage. [[Jay Gould II]], tennis champion and grandson of railroad [[tycoon]] [[Jay Gould]], sailed for a three-month stay at his Hawaiian home.&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-06-04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-09-17&gt;{{cite news | title = Jay Gould here on trip to east | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 17 September 1927 | page = A1 }}&lt;!--length of stay--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also sailing were movie star [[Laura La Plante]] and her husband, director [[William A. Seiter]],&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-06-04 /&gt; and, [[Western Auto]] founder [[George Pepperdine]], who began a three-month tour of the [[Orient]] with his daughters.&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-06-04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-09-17 /&gt;&lt;!-- length of stay, daughters --&gt; On arrival in Honolulu on 10&amp;nbsp;June, ''City of Honolulu'' was adorned with flowers and received a welcome from airplanes and a flotilla of [[outrigger canoe]]s that escorted her into the harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = New liner welcomed at islands | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 11 June 1927 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a ten-day stay in the islands,&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-06-05 /&gt; she departed for Los Angeles, returning there on 26&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;ref name=LAT-1927-06-26 /&gt;

=== Career ===
After completion of her maiden voyage, ''City of Honolulu'' began regular service from Los Angeles to Honolulu and [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]] on what {{LASSCO}} called the &quot;Great Circle Route of Sunshine&quot;. After arriving at Honolulu, the ship would sail southeast to Hilo, passing the islands of [[Molokai]] and [[Maui]] on their north sides. On the return from Hilo, the liner would traverse the [[ʻAlalākeiki Channel|ʻAlalākeiki]], the [[ʻAuʻau Channel|ʻAuʻau]], and the [[Kalohi Channel]]s, taking the ship between Maui and Molokai on the north and the islands of [[Kahoolawe]] and [[Lanai]] on the south.&lt;ref name=timetable-map&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timetableimages.com/maritime/images/lasscoi.htm |title=Hawaii direct from Los Angeles |type=brochure and timetable |date=February 1927 |publisher=Los Angeles Steamship Company}} (Convenience copy located at [http://www.timetableimages.com/maritime/index.htm Maritime Timetable Images].)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her career, ''City of Honolulu'' transported many notable passengers to Hawaii. In July 1927, for example, [[Henry Smith Pritchett]], president of the [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]], sailed to Hawaii en route to a meeting with the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Shipping and Los Angeles Harbor news | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 2 July 1927 | page = 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 1928, movie stars [[Norma Talmadge]], [[Gilbert Roland]], and [[Lottie Pickford]] began a Hawaiian vacation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 2 June 1928 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 28&amp;nbsp;July, [[Jane Addams]], the founder of [[Hull House]] and a pioneer of the [[settlement movement]], headed there as well. Addams was on her way to attend the Pan-Pacific Women's Conference and the congress of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]; a former [[List of Governors of Hawaii|Governor of Hawaii]], [[Walter F. Frear]], returned to the islands on that same voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Busy week-end due at harbor  | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 28 July 1928 | page = 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, [[Al Jolson]] and his wife, [[Ruby Keeler]], sailed on the liner for a vacation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bookings heavy for Hawaii trip | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 15 December 1928 | page = A16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and early the next February, the reigning [[The Open Championship|British Open]] golf champion, [[Walter Hagen]], sailed to start a four-month golfing tour and exhibition in Australia. Hagan was accompanied by Australian golfer [[Joe Kirkwood, Sr.|Joe Kirkwood]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Hagen sails for Hawaii | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 2 February 1930 | page = E12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arctic explorer]] [[Donald B. MacMillan]] also left for Hawaii on the same sailing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cave | first = Wayne B | title = Hawaii travel gain indicated | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 31 January 1930 | page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlohaTowerAtNight.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Aloha Tower]] at [[Honolulu Harbor]] welcomed the ''City of Honolulu'' and her passengers on their arrival in Hawaii.]]
''City of Honolulu'' also carried notable visitors to the [[Continental United States|mainland]]. Farris M. Brown, a dealer in [[Stradivarius|Stradivarius instruments]], arrived in Los Angeles in May 1928 with three of the famous maker's violins, including the [[Baron Knoop Stradivarius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Glorified peddler debarks | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 26 May 1928 | page = A6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1929, [[Sweden|Swedish]] swimmer [[Arne Borg]], accompanied by his wife, arrived in Los Angeles on a world swimming tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Borg visitor in Southland  | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 27 April 1929 | page =10  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May, Sir [[James Gunnson]], a former [[Mayor of Auckland]], arrived for a one-month visit to promote increased trade between California and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Original booster for city arrives | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 25 May 1929 | page = A1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next January, [[Herbert James Hagerman|Herbert Hagerman]], former [[List of Governors of New Mexico Territory|Governor of New Mexico Territory]]; author [[Basil Woon]], who had been doing research for a Hawaiian story; and aviation promoter and chewing gum magnate [[William Edward Easterwood|William Easterwood]] all sailed stateside on the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cave | first = Wayne B | title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 4 January 1930 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from notable passengers carried during her tenure, ''City of Honolulu'' also frequently served as a conveyance for newlyweds heading for Hawaiian honeymoons.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, &quot;Sundays on new honeymoon&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', 7 May 1928, p. A11; and &quot;Honeymooners 'in the same boat'&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', 27 August 1928, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; She also carried, in addition to passengers, cargo in both directions, transporting commodities, such as fertilizer and oil, to Hawaii,&lt;ref name=LAT-1930-05-26&gt;{{cite news | title = Local liner in flames | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 26 May 1930 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hawaiian goods, like sugar and fresh and canned pineapple to the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, &quot;Excursionists land today&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', 18 August 1928, p. A9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fire and scrapping ===
''City of Honolulu''{{'}}s career as a tropical liner, however, was short-lived. On the afternoon of 25 May 1930, just shy of completing three years of {{LASSCO}} service, a fire broke out on her B deck while she was docked in her namesake city. Although aided by [[fireboat Leleiona|fireboat ''Leleiona'']] and U.S. Navy submarine rescue ship {{USS|Widgeon|ASR-1|2}}, firefighters were unable to bring the blaze under control quickly, and it spread to {{convert|100|ST|t}} of [[potash]] aboard the liner. Fears that her cargo of {{convert|16000|oilbbl}} of oil would explode caused firefighters to intentionally sink the liner at her pier in order to help extinguish the conflagration.&lt;ref name=LAT-1930-05-26 /&gt; Through firefighters' efforts, the fire was contained to the upper three decks, leaving the ship's power plant relatively undamaged.&lt;ref name=LAT-1930-06-11&gt;{{cite news | last = Drake | first = Waldo | title = Lassco's liner due in dry dock | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 11 June 1930 | page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All crew members and {{LASSCO}} employees on board the ship got off safely; no passengers were on the ship at the time of the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Associated Press]] | title = Burned liner's crew all safe | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 27 May 1930 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was pumped out and raised on 9 June, and taken to the naval drydock at [[Pearl Harbor]] for inspection on 12 June.&lt;ref name=LAT-1930-06-11 /&gt; While remaining in Hawaii, one engine was restored to working order and the ship departed for Los Angeles under her own power on 30&amp;nbsp;October. After her arrival, further inspections were conducted, and it was determined that repairs would be too expensive, especially given the [[Great Depression|global economic conditions]]. ''City of Honolulu'' was declared a total loss,&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-339 /&gt; and was laid up in the West Basin of Los Angeles Harbor for almost three years.&lt;ref name=LAT-1932-12-20&gt;{{cite news | last = Cave | first = Wayne B | title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 20 December 1932 | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her lay up, fittings and fixtures stripped from the vessel were auctioned in July 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Steamship salvage auction... |type=display advertisement |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=31 July 1932 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December, film crews from [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia Pictures Corporation]] spent ten days filming on board the ship.&lt;!-- no indication in refs as to what the film was. My OR points towards &quot;Fog&quot;, a 1933 release from Columbia set on board a ship --&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT-1932-12-20 /&gt;

''City of Honolulu'' was sold to Japanese [[ship breaking|shipbreakers]] in mid 1933,&lt;ref name=LAT-1933-08-02&gt;{{cite news | last = Drake | first = Waldo | title = Two old liners to be scrapped | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 2 August 1933 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and—in the company of {{SS|Calawaii||2}}, another {{LASSCO}} ship destined for the scrap heap—the ''City of Honolulu'' departed Los Angeles in late August under her own power.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-339 /&gt; Manned by a [[Philippines|Filipino]] crew,&lt;ref name=LAT-1933-08-02 /&gt; the 33-year-old liner developed a problem with one of her boilers almost immediately and had to put in to San Francisco for repairs. Getting underway after a lengthy delay, one of her engines failed in mid-ocean, leaving her to plod on to Japan on one engine.&lt;ref name=LAT-1933-09-29&gt;{{cite news | last = Drake | first = Waldo | title = Hopes for deep fairway rise | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 29 September 1933 | page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually arrived in [[Osaka]] at the shipbreaker in mid-December, and was scrapped shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-339 /&gt;
