'''Sir Richard Hussey Bickerton, 2nd Baronet''' (11 October 1759 &amp;ndash; 9 February 1832) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] naval officer, who eventually rose to the rank of [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|admiral]]. He was born in [[Southampton]], the son of [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 1st Baronet|Vice-admiral Sir Richard Bickerton]] and first served aboard [[HMS Medway (1742)|HMS ''Medway'']] in June 1774, in the [[Mediterranean]]. His first command came in March 1779 when he was given [[HMS Swallow (1779)|HM Sloop ''Swallow'']] as a reward for his part in an engagement with a much larger opponent. Bickerton later joined [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rodney's]] squadron in the [[West Indies]] where he took part in the [[capture of Sint Eustatius]] in 1781. Making [[Post Captain|Post]] on 8 February 1781, He took temporary command of [[HMS Invincible (1869)|HMS ''Invincible'']] and fought in her at the [[Battle of Fort Royal]] on 29 April 1781.

When Britain entered the [[French Revolutionary War]] in 1793, Bickerton joined the [[Channel Fleet]] before, in October 1794, being ordered to transport [[John Vaughan (British Army officer, died 1795)|General Sir John Vaughan]] to the [[West Indies]], to take command of British land forces there. After another spell in home waters, Bickerton was sent to the Mediterranean where he spent much of the war on blockade duty and, after their surrender, oversaw the evacuation of French forces from [[Alexandria]]. He remained in the Mediterranean during the short-lived peace and when hostilities renewed was second in command to [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] there.

Forced ashore by illness in 1805, Bickerton first served as a Lord of the Admiralty before finishing his naval career as [[Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth]], having attained the rank of full admiral in 1812.

==Personal life==
Richard Bickerton was born in [[Southampton]] on 11 October 1759, the son of [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 1st Baronet|Vice-admiral Sir Richard Bickerton]] and Mary Anne Hussey.&lt;ref name=Who38&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nicholas |last1=Tracy |titlelink1= |others= |title=Who's Who in Nelson's Navy |origyear= |publisher=Chatham Publishing |location=London |year=2006 |language= |isbn=1-86176-244-5 |page=38 |pages= |at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September 1788, he married Anne, daughter of Dr James Athill of [[Antigua]]. Bickerton succeeded as 2nd Baronet in 1792 when his father died.&lt;ref name=Who38/&gt; He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1810 and served as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Poole, Dorset|Poole]] from 1808 until 1812.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Pcommons2.htm Leigh Rayment Members of Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Who39&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nicholas |last1=Tracy |titlelink1= |others= |title=Who's Who in Nelson's Navy |origyear= |publisher=Chatham Publishing |location=London |year=2006 |language= |isbn=1-86176-244-5 |page=39 |pages= |at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 January 1815, Bickerton was made a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Bath]] then later, in May 1823, he inherited the estate of [[Woodwalton|Wood Walton]] and on doing so began using his mother's maiden name before his own surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nicholas |last1=Tracy |titlelink1= |others= |title=Who's Who in Nelson's Navy |origyear= |publisher=Chatham Publishing |location=London |year=2006 |language= |isbn=1-86176-244-5 |page=|pages=39–40 |at=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval career==
Bickerton joined the [[Royal Navy]], aged 12, on 14 December 1771, although this was in name only: He was entered in the muster of his father's ships, [[HMS Marlborough (1767)|''Marlborough'']] and later [[HMY Princess Augusta|''Princess Augusta'']], but did not actually serve until June 1774, when he joined [[HMS Medway (1742)|HMS ''Medway'']] as a captain's servant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=gent&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FEs3AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA176 The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 102, Part 1, p. 175 - 176]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently promoted to midshipman, he served under Captain [[William Affleck (Royal Navy officer)|William Affleck]] in the [[Mediterranean]], returning home in 1777 on board [[HMS Invincible (1765)|''Invincible'']], commanded by [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Hyde Parker]].&lt;ref name=Who38/&gt;

===Master and Commander===
Bickerton was promoted to lieutenant on 16 December 1777 and served under [[Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham|Charles Middleton]] first on board the 90-gun [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']], then the seventy-four, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|''Royal Oak'']] in March 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nicholas |last1=Tracy |titlelink1= |others= |title=Who's Who in Nelson's Navy |origyear= |publisher=Chatham Publishing |location=London |year=2006 |language= |isbn=1-86176-244-5 |page= |pages=38–39 |at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Bickerton joined [[HMS Jupiter (1778)|HMS ''Jupiter'']] in the [[Bay of Biscay]], under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Francis Reynolds]]. On 20 October ''Jupiter'' attacked the much larger French ship-of-the-line ''Triton'', forcing her to retire; as a reward for his conduct, Bickerton, on Middleton's recommendation, was in March 1779, promoted [[Commander (Royal Navy)|master]] and given command of [[HMS Swallow (1779)|HM Sloop ''Swallow'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Who39&quot;/&gt; ''Swallow'' spent just under two years in [[The Channel]], cruising and undertaking escort duties.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;J. K. Laughton, ‘Bickerton, Sir Richard Hussey, second baronet (1759–1832)’, rev.

His prompt action allowed the convoy to escape.&lt;ref name=Who39/&gt; After assisting in the capture of a Dutch convoy, on 2 January 1780, Bickerton and his vessel were sent to the [[West Indies]] to join [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rodney's]] squadron and subsequently take part in the [[capture of Sint Eustatius]] in 1781.&lt;ref name=Who39/&gt;&lt;ref name=gent/&gt;

===Post Captain===
Rodney promoted Bickerton to the rank of [[Post Captain]] on 8 February 1781 and gave him temporary command of [[HMS Invincible (1869)|HMS ''Invincible'']]. It was in her that Bickerton took part in the [[Battle of Fort Royal]], an action fought on 29 April 1781, off the coast of [[Martinique]]. Bickerton acquired his own ship, [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], in May, before briefly transferring to [[HMS Terrible (1762)|''Terrible'']] but, finding her unfit, moved to the frigate, [[HMS Amazon (1773)|HMS ''Amazon'']], in July.&lt;ref name=gent/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Bickerton's entries in the Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Chronicle, and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, have him in command of [[HMS Terrible (1762)|HMS ''Terrible'']] at some point between ''Russell'' and ''Amazon''. The latter was reviewed by Nicholas Tracy but Tracy's own book, Who's Who in Nelson's Navy, however, does not mention this brief command.|group=Note}} After service in the [[British Leeward Islands|Leeward Islands]] and North American waters, Bickerton returned to England in ''Amazon'', arriving in [[Portsmouth]] in February 1782.&lt;ref name=Who39/&gt; In September, Bickerton was given the newly repaired [[French frigate Brune (1756)|HMS ''Brune'']]; she was decommissioned in May the following year and Bickerton was without a ship until January 1787, when he commissioned [[HMS Sibyl (1779)|HMS ''Sibyl'']] and in her sailed for the Leeward Islands once more.&lt;ref name=gent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rif |last1=Winfield |titlelink1= |others= |title=[[British Warships in the Age of Sail]] 1714–1792: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates |origyear= |publisher=Seaforth Publishing |location= |year=2007 |language= |isbn=978-1-84415-700-6 |page=202 |pages= |at=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolutionary War===
When France declared [[French Revolutionary War|war in 1793]], Bickerton was given command of [[HMS Ruby (1776)|HMS ''Ruby'']] and served in her in The Channel until September 1794 when he moved to [[HMS Ramillies (1785)|HMS ''Ramillies'']] and joined [[Lord Howe]] in the Bay of Biscay.&lt;ref name=Who39/&gt;&lt;ref name=gent/&gt; In October 1794 he transported [[John Vaughan (British Army officer, died 1795)|General Sir John Vaughan]] to the [[West Indies]], to succeed [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|Lieutenant-general Sir Charles Grey]] as the Commander-in-chief of British land forces there.&lt;ref name=gent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rev.

Bickerton served under Duncan for the whole of the following year, then in 1797, he and his ship transferred to the [[Channel Fleet]] under [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Admiral Alexander Hood]].&lt;ref name=Who39/&gt;&lt;ref name=gent/&gt; In 1798, Bickerton took command of the new [[HMS Terrible (1785)|HMS ''Terrible'']], built in 1785 to replace the old ''Terrible'', scuttled after the [[Battle of Chesapeake]]. Later in 1798, Bickerton was given the title of Colonel of Marines, then on 14 February 1799, Bickerton attained the rank of [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-admiral]] and, towards the end of the year, took up the position of Assistant [[Port Admiral#Royal Navy|Port Admiral]] at Portsmouth.
&lt;ref name=Who39/&gt;&lt;ref name=gent/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Colonel of Marines was a ceremonial rank in the Royal Navy, usually bestowed upon [[Post Captain]]s for good service. It carried an increase in salary with no extra duties or responsibilities. Not to be confused with a colonel in the marines.|group=Note}}

====Service in the Mediterranean====
[[File:Jacques Menou 1750 1810.jpg|thumb|Jacques-François Menou whose respect was earned by Bickerton during the evacuation of Alexandria]]
Bickerton hoisted his flag in [[HMS Seahorse (1794)|''Seahorse'']] on 13 May 1800 and was ordered to transport generals [[Ralph Abercromby|Abercromby]], [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Moore]] and [[John Hely-Hutchinson, 2nd Earl of Donoughmore|Hutchinson]] to the Mediterranean; after which he spent the rest of the war under [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]], on blockade duty.&lt;ref name=gent/&gt; On 10 June, Bickerton transferred his flag to the 74-gun [[HMS Swiftsure (1787)|''Swiftsure'']] and began a five-month command of a squadron off [[Cádiz]] before maintaining a blockade on the port of [[Alexandria]] until its capitulation on 27 August.&lt;ref name=Who39/&gt;&lt;ref name=gent/&gt; Left to oversee the French withdrawal, Bickerton conducted this duty with such efficiency that he earned the respect of the French general, [[Jacques-François Menou]], who also acknowledged that, &quot; ...the vigilance of Sir Richard's squadron had accelerated the reduction of that place, as it cut them off from all supply&quot;. For his part in the British victory, the grateful Turks awarded Bickerton with the [[Order of the Crescent]] on 8 October 1801. Following the [[Treaty of Amiens]], Bickerton, with his flag in [[HMS Kent (1798)|HMS ''Kent'']], was left behind in command of the Mediterranean Fleet.&lt;ref name=gent/&gt;

===Napoleonic Wars===
By 1804, still in the Mediterranean and having transferred to [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|''Sovereign'']], Bickerton was serving as Second-in-Command to [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]], maintaining a close blockade on the French port of [[Toulon]] and when Nelson received the thanks of the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]], he insisted that Bickerton received equal recognition.&lt;ref name=gent/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Bickerton was elevated to [[Commander-in-Chief]] in the Mediterranean when Nelson left to pursue the French Fleet across the [[Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=gent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3512848/Lord-Nelsons-letter-detailing-naval-strategy-against-French-to-be-sold.html Lord Nelson's letter detailing naval strategy against French to be sold] Daily Telegraph, 24 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
In spring 1805, a liver complaint forced Bickerton to return to England where shortly after he was promoted to Vice-admiral and appointed a [[Lord of the Admiralty]].&lt;ref name=gent/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; In 1810 Bickerton attained the rank of full Admiral and in April 1812 he was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth]]&lt;ref name=Who40/&gt; with [[French ship Puissant (1782)|''Puissant'']] as his flagship. Bickerton still held this post in 1814 when the Treaty of Paris was celebrated with a [[Fleet review (Commonwealth realms)|Grand Naval Review]] at [[Spithead]]. The event took place on 24 and 25 June, before the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] and his allies.&lt;ref name=gent/&gt; On 5 January 1818 Bickerton was promoted to Lieutenant-general of the Marines, then General of the Marines in June 1830.&lt;ref name=gent/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The ranks Lieutenant-general of the Marines and General of the Marines, like Colonel of the Marines, were ceremonial.|group=Note}}

==Death==
[[File:Memorial to Sir Richard Hussey Bickerton Baronet 1.jpg|thumb|left|Bickerton's memorial in Bath Abbey]]
Bickerton died at his home in [[The Circus, Bath]], at the age of 72 on 9 February 1832. His wife outlived him by several years, dying on 2 March 1850. As the couple had no children, the estate passed to  Anne's nephew, Vice-admiral Sir Richard Hussey Moubray.&lt;ref name=Who40&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nicholas |last1=Tracy |titlelink1= |others= |title=Who's Who in Nelson's Navy |origyear= |publisher=Chatham Publishing |location=London |year=2006 |language= |isbn=1-86176-244-5 |page=40 |pages= |at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of male issue also meant the baronetcy became extinct with his death.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; A memorial to Bickerton, by [[Francis Leggatt Chantrey]], was erected in [[Bath Abbey]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neoclassical Church Monuments in Britain|url=http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/CMS_Events.html|publisher=Church Monuments Society|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forsyth|first1=Michael|title=Pevsner Architectural Guides: Bath|date=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300101775|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Brian L.|title=Harris's Guide to Churches and Cathedrals: Discovering the Unique and Unusual in Over 500 Churches and Cathedrals|date=2006|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780091912512|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bBj6l7e-kAoC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=Richard+Bickerton+Bath+Abbey#v=onepage&amp;q=Richard%20Bickerton%20Bath%20Abbey&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
