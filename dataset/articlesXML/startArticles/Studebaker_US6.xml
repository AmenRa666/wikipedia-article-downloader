The '''Studebaker US6''' [[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation#G500 - G599|(G630)]] was a family of [[2½-ton 6x6 truck|2½-ton 6x6]] and 5-ton 6x4 trucks manufactured by the [[Studebaker|Studebaker Corporation]] and [[REO Motor Car Company]] during [[World War II]]. The basic cargo version was designed to transport a {{convert|5,000|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|12|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long cargo load over all terrain in all weather. Most were exported to the Soviet Union.

== History ==
{{expand section|date=February 2014}}
In 1939 the US Army Ordnance Corps set standards for a [[Six-wheel drive|6×6]] truck with a {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton (2,238kg) off-road payload. Studebaker, [[Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company|Yellow Coach]] (a [[General Motors|GM]] company), and [[International Harvester]] submitted designs. All three were accepted and in production by 1941.

The US6 was built primarily for export under the [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease act]], the Soviet Union would be the largest operator. Production began at Studebaker's South Bend, Indiana, truck plant in June 1941, in 1944 REO's Lansing, Michigan plant would also build them.

The first Studebakers arrived in USSR in the autumn of 1941. The Red Army organized a test of eleven 6x6 &quot;Studebekkers&quot; (as they become called in the USSR) which took place between July 1942 and May 1943. The results were to enlarge the payload from {{frac|2|1|2}} tons (2,300kg) to 4 tons (3,600kg).{{sfnp|Jeghers|2000|pp=18-19}} In 1945 it was lowered to {{frac|3|1|2}} tons (3,200kg, although on improved roads they could carry up to 5 tons (4,500kg).

A total of 219,882 {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton (2,268&amp;nbsp;kg) 6x6 and variant 5-ton (4,536&amp;nbsp;kg) 6x4 trucks in thirteen variations were built. Studebaker was the primary manufacturer, building 197,678, while REO sub-contracted 22,204 more. REO trucks are identical to Studebakers, but REO only built long wheelbase without winch cargo models.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|184, 328-329}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|122-124}}

== Specifications ==

=== Engine and driveline ===
[[File:Hercules_JXD_engine_right.jpg|thumb|right|Hercules JXD engine]]
[[File:Stude US6 shift patterns.jpg|thumb|Dump truck w/winch shift patterns]]
[[File:Stude US6 frame.jpg|thumb|Long wheelbase frame]]
The US6 used a Hercules JXD engine, a [[Engine displacement|{{convert|320|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]]  [[Flathead engine|L-head]] [[Straight six engine|inline 6 cylinder]] [[Petrol engine|gasoline engine]] developing [[Horsepower|{{convert|86|hp|kW|abbr=on}}]] at 2800&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and {{convert|200|lbfft|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 1150&amp;nbsp;rpm. A conservative and reliable engine with a compression ratio of only 5.82:1, it could use 72 octane gasoline. This engine was also used in the M3 and later M8/M20 armored cars.{{sfnp|TM 9-807|1943|pp=138–139}}{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|184, 328-329}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|122-124}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2800|1947}}

The [[BorgWarner|Warner]] T 93 5 speed [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] had a very low 1st, direct 4th, and overdrive 5th gear. A power take-off could be fitted to operate a winch and/or the hydraulic hoist on dump trucks.{{sfnp|TM 9-1807|1944|pp=22-23}}

The [[Timken Company|Timken]] T-79 [[transfer case]] had high and low ranges, a neutral position, and engaged/disengaged the front axle. There was one output shaft forward to the front axle (not used in 6x4s) and two shafts to the rear, one for each rear axle.{{sfnp|TM 9-1807|1944|pp=43–44}}

Both front and rear axles were Timken split types with a 6.6:1 ratio. The front had ball-type constant-velocity joints, the rears were full-floating.{{sfnp|TM 9-1807|1944|pp=84–87, 127–129}}

=== Chassis ===
The US6 had a [[Vehicle frame#Ladder Frame|ladder frame]] with three [[beam axle]]s, the front on semi elliptical [[leaf spring]]s, the rear tandem on quarter elliptical leaf springs with locating arms.{{sfnp|TM 9-807|1943|pp=289-290}}{{sfnp|TM 9-1807|1944|pp=177-179}}

There were two wheelbases, the short {{convert|148|in|m|2}}, used in semi tractors, dump trucks, and short cargo models, and the long {{convert|162|in|m|2}}, used in tankers, long cargo models, and the U9 chassis cab (measurements are from the centerline of the front axle to the centerline of rear bogie). All models had 7.50-20” tires and dual rear tires. 6x4 models, intended for on road use only, were rated at 5 tons (4536&amp;nbsp;kg), twice the 6x6’s off road rating.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|122-124}}
{{sfnp|TM 9-807|1943|p=14}}

=== Cab ===
The US6 used Studebaker’s civilian truck cab, modified for military use. Studebaker trucks were unique from other {{frac|2|1|2}} trucks built for the war effort because [[Quarter glass|vent windows]] were included in each door.  These windows were separate from the window that rolled down into the door and could be rotated out to help with ventilation.

Studebaker designed the open military cab also used by the CCKW, but their major customer, the U.S.S.R, preferred the closed cab for their climate. While Studebaker's open cab became the US standard, the US6 returned to the closed cab after only 10,000 units.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|122-124}}

File:US6 Dump U11.jpg|Dump U11
File:US6 Dump U13.jpg|Dump U13
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The '''U1''' and winch equipped '''U2 cargo truck''' had a short wheelbase and the spare tire mounted behind the cab, allowing a bed only {{convert|9|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} long. These “prime mover” style bodies were not a success, the US6 was to be used primarily for cargo.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|184, 328-329}}

The '''U3/U4''' and 6x4 '''U7/U8 cargo truck''' had a long wheelbase, allowing the spare tire to be mounted under a {{convert|12|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} bed. 197,000 trucks with the {{convert|12|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} bed were built.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|184, 328-329}}

The '''U5 gasoline tank truck''' had a long wheelbase and a two compartment {{convert|750|u.s.gal|l|abbr=on}} tank body. Tankers did not have winches.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|184, 328-329}}

The 6x4 '''U6 semi tractor''' was the only tractor in the series. Semi tractors have limited off-road performance, so the U6 was rated for a 5-ton load on improved roads. For the same reason, they had no front winch.

The '''U9 chassis-cab''' had a long wheelbase and no winch. The [[Katyusha rocket launcher]] could be mounted on them.

The '''U10/U11 end dump trucks''' and the '''U12/U13 side dump trucks''' had a short wheelbase. Both had the body mounted on a sub-frame, the end dumb had a hydraulic cylinder attached to the body with a lever arrangement, the side dump had the cylinder mounted directly to the body.{{sfnp|TM 9-1807|1944|pp=211-216}}

== Combat use ==
Large numbers of [[Lend-Lease]] Studebaker trucks were sent into the Soviet Union via the [[Persian Corridor]]. The Soviets found them a good platform for &quot;Stalin Organ&quot; [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] rocket launchers, although it was not their prime use in the Soviet Union. It fulfilled many roles in the [[Red Army]], such as pulling artillery and was renowned for its ruggedness and reliability. The truck was affectionately known as the ''Studer'' by Soviet troops.

Studebaker US6 trucks were also used in the construction of the [[Burma Road]] as well as the [[Alaska Highway|Alcan Highway]] in North America.
