== hanged/hung ==

I don't know the facts, and a quick Google doesn't help, but were they:
* executed first (whether or not by hanging) and then their bodies hung in chains...
* executed by hanging using chains (unusual but I suppose could happen) ...
* hung alive in chains for a while, akin to being put in the stocks, but survived the experience?
&quot;hung&quot; would be right for the first and third, &quot;hanged&quot; for the second! Clarification is needed, please, whichever of the three is meant. [[User:PamD|PamD]] ([[User talk:PamD|talk]]) 14:15, 4 January 2008 (UTC)

I haven't been able to find a definitive account either.  However, the entry for [[Robert Aske]], wikiliinked in the [[York Castle]] story, suggests that hanging in chains was a method of execution.[[User:Acad Ronin|Acad Ronin]] ([[User talk:Acad Ronin|talk]]) 12:01, 5 January 2008 (UTC)
:Actually, what [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Aske_%28political_leader%29&amp;diff=182291545&amp;oldid=177866343 this diff] suggests is that you altered the Aske entry from &quot;hung&quot; to &quot;hanged&quot; three minutes before you made the above comment. --[[User:GuillaumeTell|GuillaumeTell]] ([[User talk:GuillaumeTell|talk]]) 18:30, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

::http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbet#Display,  http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/gibbeting.htm (its reference) and http://blindkat.hegewisch.net/pirates/punish.html#hanging  all refer to &quot;hanging in chains&quot; as the display of an already-hung corpse in a gibbet or similar. [[User:PamD|PamD]] ([[User talk:PamD|talk]]) 13:58, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

:: 1) Obviously, I did change that one, but only to make it consistent with the usage in the preceeding paragraph, which clearly argues for hanging in chains as a method of execution, and that usage was not mine.  2) That one uses hanging in chains as a method of execution does not prevent it being used as a form of display of corpses post execution.  Putting someone in a hanging cage and letting them starve to death would also be a method of execution.  3) The problem is not the general situation, but rather, what was the situation in this particular case, and that I have not been able to pin down definitively.  The closest I have come is the wiki link to Roger Aske, which again, was not my formulation.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Acad Ronin|Acad Ronin]] ([[User talk:Acad Ronin|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Acad Ronin|contribs]]) 00:36, 6 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::: OK. I have found two references via Google books. The 1857 reference says Clifford was executed at York, and his body hung in chains. The more recent book (1990), says he was hanged in chains. Those were the only two references I could find. Which do we go with? [[User:Acad Ronin|Acad Ronin]] ([[User talk:Acad Ronin|talk]]) 01:11, 6 January 2008 (UTC)

== Writing and linking monarchs - consistency? ==

In this article we've got:
*[[William I of England|William I]] 
*King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]
*[[Richard III of England|King Richard III]]
and more examples of each of the three (ie &quot;King&quot; absent, or outside the link, or inside the link).  I've not checked what [[WP:MOS]] says about this, but can we at least be consistent within the one article? [[User:PamD|PamD]] ([[User talk:PamD|talk]]) 20:48, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

Personally I'd go with not using &quot;King&quot; if they have a number, Richard III feels more correct than King Richard III.  But King John is a king to distinguish him from the period when he was Prince John.[[User:MidlandLinda|MidlandLinda]] ([[User talk:MidlandLinda|talk]]) 20:51, 16 October 2008 (UTC)

== Expansion... ==

I've gone through and given the article a thorough scrub through and expansion. There's general consensus in the histories of York Castle on most of the aspects, and I've made extensive use of Butler's official guide to the castle, and Cooper's turn of the century Edwardian volume, which is very strong on the castle's history as a prison. The expansion will need copy editing however! [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 09:31, 7 November 2010 (UTC)
:I've had a quick look, and there's lots of good stuff there.  I'll give it a copy-edit, probably tomorrow.  I do think that the reference to Clifford's Tower at the start of the lead is very  misleading - the castle isn't just the medieval tower but the whole complex, including the curtain-wall behind the Castle Museum, the ex-prisons, the Crown Court and the remains of the prison walls on the south bank of the Foss. --&lt;font color=&quot;forestgreen&quot;&gt;[[User:GuillaumeTell|'''Guillaume''']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[User talk:GuillaumeTell|''Tell'']]&lt;/font&gt; 22:40, 7 November 2010 (UTC)
::I've taken a go at rewriting the start of the lead - see what you think. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 22:14, 8 November 2010 (UTC)

==A couple of problems==
I spotted a couple of minor problems while reading through.
#Under 12th century the wikilink for &quot;special economic role as moneylenders&quot; goes to a non-existent section.
#Under 17th century reference 91 Twyford indicates multiple pages but start &amp; end page is the same.

:*I think the link should work better now.
:*Typo fixed. 
:*Cheers!

::Umm, the 12th century wikilink now works, but it points to [[Economy_of_England_in_the_Middle_Ages#Mid-medieval_growth_.281100-1290.29]]. Shouldn't the link be to [[Economy_of_England_in_the_Middle_Ages#Jewish_contribution_to_the_English_economy]]? --&lt;font color=&quot;forestgreen&quot;&gt;[[User:GuillaumeTell|'''Guillaume''']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[User talk:GuillaumeTell|''Tell'']]&lt;/font&gt; 22:29, 17 November 2010 (UTC)

== Pogrom of 1190 ==

I've reverted the previous change about the atrocities in 1190, as the source being cited (Butler) doesn't support the alteration. Butler notes that Rabbi Yomtob &quot;called upon his fellow Jews to commit suicide rather than suffer their inevitable murder&quot;; although a &quot;few survivors surrendered on the promise of Christian baptism... they were massacred&quot;. Butler doesn't suggest that the mob were attempting forcible conversion, but rather simple murder. Happy to discuss further here, of course!

== Administrative history ==

Can anyone shed any light on the administrative history of York Castle?  [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10475867&amp;c_id=10001043 A Vision of Britain Through Time] states that it was an extra-parochial area until 1858, and a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] after that date.  It is shown as part of York Urban Sanitary District, but not of the Municipal Borough of York or, after 1889, the County Borough of York.  [http://histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser?path=Browse/Census%20%28by%20geography%29/England/1931&amp;active=yes&amp;mno=254&amp;tocstate=expandnew&amp;display=sections&amp;display=tables&amp;display=pagetitles&amp;pageseq=49&amp;zoom=5 Online Historical Population Reports] for the 1931 census states that, although the castle appears to have been added to the Municipal Borough of York by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, ''&quot;it is not locally recognised as forming part thereof.&quot;''  Earlier census reports [http://histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser?path=Browse/Census%20%28by%20geography%29/England/1901&amp;active=yes&amp;mno=109&amp;tocstate=expandnew&amp;display=sections&amp;display=tables&amp;display=pagetitles&amp;pageseq=22&amp;zoom=5 on that site] state that it was governed by a joint committee of the East Riding, North Riding and West Riding county councils, and ''&quot;though situated in the City of York, is not under the jurisdiction of the Corporation.&quot;''  Census reports after 1931 are not available online until 2001, but it is clear that, following local government reorganisation in 1974, the castle was simply part of the [[unparished area]] of York.  Does anyone know when the castle became part of the city and county borough?  [[User:Skinsmoke|Skinsmoke]] ([[User talk:Skinsmoke|talk]]) 02:56, 8 June 2012 (UTC)
:I'd try Thomas Parson's 1911 work for the earlier period, at least; from what I remember, it was very detailed and covered this sort of thing. Drop me an email if you can't find a copy. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 05:54, 8 June 2012 (UTC)
::I don't think the earlier period is the problem.  Although the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 appeared to add the castle to the municipal borough, this clearly wasn't what happened in reality, and the castle continued to be governed separately.  The change seems to have really occurred sometime between 1931 and 1974.  [[User:Skinsmoke|Skinsmoke]] ([[User talk:Skinsmoke|talk]]) 16:22, 2 July 2012 (UTC)
