'''John Steven Leake''' [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|DSM]] (26 October 1949 – 13 February 2000) was an English recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal whilst working for the [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes]] (NAAFI), one of only twelve to be issued to the British forces during the [[Falklands War]]. Prior to working for the NAAFI, he worked in private security and was a soldier in the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] of the [[British Army]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Erdington]], a suburb of [[Birmingham]], [[England]], Leake attended [[Albert Road School]] in [[Aston]].&lt;ref name=birminghammail2000&gt;{{cite news|last=Hurst|first=Ben|title=Falklands war hero is killed by cancer|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17631727.html|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=Birmingham Mail|date=19 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leake joined the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]], serving with the 1st Battalion of the Regiment in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colchester 1980-1983 (including Armagh 1981 and Kenya 1982)|url=http://www.keepmilitarymuseum.org/devonanddorset/colchester.php?&amp;dx=1&amp;ob=3&amp;rpn=history|publisher=The Keep Military Museum|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of his roles, he was an instructor in the use of the [[General-purpose machine gun]].&lt;ref name=auctionpage /&gt; 

At the age of 24 he left the [[British Army]] to work for private security companies, including for [[Securicor]] at [[Birmingham Airport]].&lt;ref name=auctionpage /&gt;&lt;ref name=dailymailpostauction/&gt; He was working for locally based [[IMI plc]], when he decided to join the [[West Midlands Police]], but after arriving early for his interview he read a local paper and saw an advertisement for the [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes]] (NAAFI), and decided to apply for a job with them instead.&lt;ref name=birminghammail2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=auctionpage /&gt;

==NAAFI career==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = Petty Officer Leake originally joined HMS Ardent as a civilian NAAFI Canteen Manager. On the declaration of Active Service he volunteered to enrol as a Petty Officer on 15th May 1982.

On 21st May 1982 HMS Ardent came under heavy attack by Argentine aircraft. Using his previous Army training, Petty Officer Leake was stationed as a machine gunner. Throughout the air attacks he remained cool and calm even though the ship was being hit by bombs and cannon fire. He fired large quantities of accurate tracer at the attackers and inflicted damage on a Skyhawk. His courage, steadfastness and total disregard for his own safety undoubtedly saved the ship from many further attacks and was an inspiration to all those in the vicinity.

By the time the [[Falklands War]] broke out in 1982, Leake was serving as a Canteen Manager in the Naval Canteen Service wing of the NAAFI onboard [[HMS Ardent (F184)|HMS ''Ardent'']], a [[Royal Navy]] [[Type 21 frigate]].&lt;ref name=dailymailpostauction/&gt; His role on board the ship was to run an onboard shop selling [[confectionery]], cigarettes, beer and toiletries to other members of the crew.&lt;ref name=dailymailpostauction/&gt;

The ship was ordered to proceed to [[Ascension Island]], where after three days it proceeded to the Falklands.&lt;ref name=dailymailpostauction/&gt; On the morning of 7 May, he was invited to practice on a general-purpose machine gun, being informed afterwards that he was to take up that role instead at action stations should active service be declared,&lt;ref name=auctionpage /&gt; with his former role of casualty coordinator in sickbay being taken by his Canteen Assistant, Nigel Woods.&lt;ref name=canmansview&gt;{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Nigel|title=‘Through Fire and Water’ - The Falklands War from the NAAFI Canman Assistant's Viewpoint|url=http://www.hmsardent.org.uk/page29/page62/page62.html|publisher=HMS Arden Association|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst onroute, active service was declared and Leake signed on to the Royal Navy on a temporary basis, becoming a [[petty officer]] in the Royal Navy, but continuing in his previous role as Canteen Manager. Being a member of the Navy allowed him to be covered by the protections of the [[Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name=dailymailpostauction/&gt;

On 21 May, the ''Ardent'' moved into position in [[Falkland Sound]] as the lead ship to bombard Argentine positions in order to divert the attention of the enemy force from the British landing in the [[San Carlos Water|San Carlo inlet]]. Leake operated a deck mounted machine gun during the ensuing attacks by Argentine aircraft, and was credited with downing an Argentine [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]],&lt;ref name=auctionpage /&gt;&lt;ref name=dailymailpostauction/&gt; puncturing the plane's fuel tanks.&lt;ref name=canmansview /&gt; He continued to man the gun whilst the ship was hit by seventeen missiles and bombs. Along with the remaining crew, Leake abandoned ship, boarding [[HMS Yarmouth (F101)|HMS ''Yarmouth'']], which pulled alongside the listing ''Ardent''.&lt;ref name=dailymailpostauction/&gt;

Leake was later posted to [[HMS Sutherland (F81)|HMS ''Sutherland'']], and died on 13 February 2000 in [[St Luke's Hospice, Plymouth]], from [[cancer]] after previously having a kidney removed in an attempt to beat the disease. His funeral took place at the crematorium at [[Weston Mill, Plymouth]] on 21 February 2000.&lt;ref name=birminghammail2000 /&gt;

==Private life==
He married Carole, and together they had a son as well as two sons from Carole's previous marriage. At the time of his death, he was living in [[Milehouse]], [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref name=birminghammail2000 /&gt; 
He was 1 of 5 bothers: David, Ian Geoffrey and Stephen

==Legacy==
[[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Sandy Woodward]], the commander of the British Naval Force during the Falklands War, wrote about Leake in his memoirs. He said &quot;I was sure there would be many stories of heroism to come out of it, but of them all, I remain most impressed by the conduct of John Leake who manned the machine gun in Ardent. He was not really in the Navy, but, as we say, we are all of one company, the Captain and the NAAFI man. And we all go together.&quot;&lt;ref name=auctionpage&gt;{{cite web|title=Lot 958, 23 Sep 11|url=http://www.dnw.co.uk/medals/auctionarchive/searchcataloguearchive/itemdetail.lasso?itemid=80625|publisher=Dix Noonan Webb|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Leake's death in 2000, his medals were put up for auction on 23 September 2011. The initial estimate expected the medals to be sold for up to £50,000.&lt;ref name=dailymailpreauction&gt;{{cite news|last=Hartley-Parkinson|first=Richard|title=Bravery medal of canteen manager who manned machine gun in Falklands War to defend his stricken ship set to sell for thousands|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2032180/HMS-Ardent-medals-Falklands-War-hero-auction.html?ITO=1490|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It instead sold for £110,000, beating the previous record paid for a Distinguished Service Medal set at £59,800 in 2003.&lt;ref name=dailymailpostauction&gt;{{cite news|last=Parsons|first=Chris|title=World record £110,000 paid for Falklands medal awarded to canteen manager who manned machine gun on doomed ship|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2042700/HMS-Ardent-Falklands-canteen-manager-John-Leakes-service-medals-sold-record-price.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
