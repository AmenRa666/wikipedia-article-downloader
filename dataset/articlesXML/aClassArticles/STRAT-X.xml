'''STRAT-X''', or '''Strategic-Experimental''', was a [[U.S. government]]-sponsored study conducted during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential future of the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear deterrent force]]. At the time, the [[Soviet Union]] was making significant strides in [[nuclear weapons delivery]], and also constructing [[anti-ballistic missile]] defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential [[missile gap|technological gap]] between the two [[superpower]]s, [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] entrusted the [[Classified information|classified]] STRAT-X study to the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the [[MGM-134 Midgetman]] and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine}}s, and the [[Trident missile|Trident]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s, among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.

==Background==
In the mid-1960s, reports received by U.S. intelligence agencies indicated that the Soviets were planning to deploy large numbers of highly accurate and powerful [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs).&lt;ref name=G10_52&gt;Grier 2010, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[R-36 (missile)|R-36]] ICBM entered service.  Possessing the greatest [[throw weight]] of any ICBM ever at {{Convert|8.8|t|lb}}, the R-36 was larger than the most modern ICBMs in the U.S. arsenal at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/icbm/r-36m.htm |title=R-36M / SS-18 SATAN |author= |date=29 July 2000 |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |publisher=FAS.org |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its size, it was able to carry high-yield warheads [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|capable of destroying]] [[Minuteman missile|Minuteman]] [[Missile launch facility|hardened silos]] (see [[Counterforce]]). This was considered a significant risk to American ICBMs and, as a result, to the United States' nuclear defense strategy by reducing the United States' [[second strike|ability to retaliate with nuclear weapons if attacked]].{{#tag:ref|&quot;First, increasingly numerous ICBMs posed a threat to America's own weapons.&quot;&lt;ref name=G10_52/&gt;|group=&quot;N&quot;}}

At the same time, the Soviets were designing and constructing increasingly sophisticated [[anti-ballistic missile]] defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow,&lt;ref name=G10_52/&gt; reducing the threat posed by American ICBMs. These developments compelled the [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]], to commission a [[Research|study]] to look into ways of improving the survivability of the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear arsenal]].&lt;ref name=G10_52/&gt;{{#tag:ref|&quot;The survivability of U.S. missiles from a Soviet first-strike attack was given particular consideration by the Strat-X participants&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=P&amp;M_184/&gt;|group=&quot;N&quot;}}

According to Graham Spinardi in his book ''From Polaris to Trident'' (1994), STRAT-X was a response by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]'s Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Lloyd Wilson, to the [[U.S. Air Force]]; the service was demanding a large ICBM called the [[BGM-75 AICBM|WS-120A]]. Spinardi suggests that STRAT-X was allowed to proceed so it could terminate the study for such a missile.&lt;ref&gt;Spinardi 1994, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the WS-120A would not be released by Secretary McNamara, and plans for such a missile were canceled in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-75.html |title=BGM-75 AICBM |first=Andreas |last=Parsch |year=2003 |work=Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles |publisher=Designation-systems.net |accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
The study was named &quot;STRAT-X&quot; in order not to reveal its intentions, and also to eliminate partiality towards [[Nuclear triad|sea-, air- or land-based systems]]. It was conducted by the Research and Engineering Support Division of the independent and non-profit [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA), which had conducted a study in early 1966 titled &quot;Pen-X&quot;, upon which STRAT-X was based.&lt;ref name=FAS_ULMS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/slbm/ssbn_ulms.htm |title=ULMS |author= |date=30 May 1997 |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |publisher=FAS.org |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; STRAT-X was chaired by President of the IDA, General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], while the institution's Fred Payne presided over STRAT-X's &quot;working&quot; panel. The panel also included executives from major independent corporations and [[defense contractor]]s such as [[Boeing]], [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], [[Thiokol]] and [[TRW Inc.|TRW]].&lt;ref name=G10_53&gt;Grier 2010, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Committee members were mostly [[military officers]], including [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Rear Admirals]] George H. Miller and Levering Smith.&lt;ref name=FAS_ULMS/&gt;
{{Quote box|quote=&quot;The systems to be analyzed need not be limited to those recommended by the services, and the STRAT-X study group is encouraged to examine system concepts unrestrained by considerations of potential management problems or political influences.&quot;|source=&lt;small&gt;Extract from a memo from the [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] to the IDA&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;|align=left|width=40%}}

On 1 November 1966, McNamara signed an order authorizing STRAT-X, officially initiating the study. During STRAT-X, the working panel was &quot;encouraged to examine system concepts unrestrained by considerations of potential management problems or political influences.&quot;&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt; The Secretary wanted new ideas about &quot;path-breaking&quot; weapons systems that were either offensive or [[Self-defense|defensive]] in nature, unhindered by defense bureaucracy, which had the potential to stifle innovation.&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt; Sea-, land- and air-based missile systems were investigated, but [[Strategic bomber|manned bombers]] and orbital systems were not. The group was also asked to consider the cost effectiveness of all systems, as well to predict possible [[Brinkmanship (Cold War)|Soviet responses]]. To meet this requirement, a series of documents were written from the perspective of the [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Soviet Minister of Defense]] General [[Andrei Grechko]], complete with [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalistic]] statements and a prediction of the eventual triumph of [[socialism]].&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP.com/&gt; In the end, a twenty-volume report covered no fewer than 125 different ideas for missile systems, nine of which were reviewed in great detail.&lt;ref name=FAS_ULMS/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/the-strat-x-report-and-its-impact/ |title=The STRAT-X Report and Its Impact |author=Burr, William |date=6 January 2010 |work=[[National Security Archive]] |publisher= |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G10_54&gt;Grier 2010, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Findings and consequences===
[[File:Small ICBM Hard Mobile Launcher USAF.jpg|thumb|A Hard Mobile Launcher that was designed to carry the [[MGM-134 Midgetman]] missile&lt;ref name=G10_54/&gt;|alt=Long vehicle in green black and dirt brown camouflage executing a turn on light-colored paved road for camera.]]

Of the nine prospective weapons systems, five were land-based. These were: &quot;Rock Silo&quot;â€”a system where missiles would be stored in hardened silos of [[granite]] [[bedrock]] in the [[Western United States|Western]] and [[Northern United States]]; &quot;Soft Silo&quot;â€”a similar system but with easily   and cheaply constructed silos; &quot;Rock Tunnel&quot;â€”a system where missiles would be transported around in deep underground networks before emerging at launch points; &quot;Soft Tunnel&quot;â€”a similar tunnel but built more cheaply and easily; and &quot;Land Mobile&quot;â€”a [[Transporter erector launcher|truck-based system]] where road-transporters traveled at speeds up to {{Convert|35|mph|km/h}} constantly around a dedicated and winding road system in {{Convert|65,000|sqmi|km2}} of public land.&lt;ref name=G10_55&gt;Grier 2010, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the remaining four, three were sea-based. These were: &quot;Canal-Based&quot;â€”a systems where missiles would be sailed in canals to confuse Soviet [[Military operation plan|military planners]]; &quot;Ship-Based&quot;â€”a system where ships carrying missile canisters would travel around the world, hiding among other traffic; and &quot;Submarine-Based&quot;â€”a system where [[ballistic missile submarine]]s would roam the oceans while carrying missile canisters outside their [[pressure hull]]s.&lt;ref name=G10_54/&gt; The single air-based based consideration was the {{anchor|Air Launched ICBM}}&quot;Air Launched ICBM&quot;, which required large aircraft carrying [[Standoff (missile)|standoff ballistic missiles]] to launch their payloads at the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=G10_54/&gt;

Despite the numerous options investigated during the study, none were fully implemented. Although the STRAT-X &quot;Land Mobile&quot; option resulted in the [[MGM-134 Midgetman]] and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] missiles, the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in the Midgetman being canceled while still a prototype,{{#tag:ref|&quot;The [MGM-134 Midgetman] missile was canceled in 1992, following the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War.&quot;&lt;ref name=G10_54/&gt;|group=&quot;N&quot;}} while only 50 out of the original 100 Peacekeeper missiles were ever fielded.&lt;ref name=G10_55/&gt; Nevertheless, the study did inspire a number of developments in nuclear weapons delivery systems.&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt; In October 1974, the U.S. Air Force successfully conducted an air launch of a Minuteman missile from a [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxy]], demonstrating the credibility of the &quot;Air Launched ICBM&quot; option of STRAT-X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1970-1980&amp;sd=01/01/1970&amp;ed=12/31/1989 |title=History Milestones |author= |date= |work=U.S. Air Force |publisher=AF.mil |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the U.S. Navy then had several classes of [[ballistic missile submarine]]s and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBM) in service, the study placed a significant emphasis on the survivability of SLBMs.&lt;ref&gt;Clearwater 1996, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the enormous ''Ohio''-class submarine and the Trident SLBMs which the ''Ohio'' class carried. The study originally called for dedicated slow-moving missile-carrying submarines (instead of converted [[SSN (hull classification symbol)|attack submarines]]) to embark missiles outside their hulls and rely primarily on stealth for survivability. However, Admiral [[Hyman Rickover]], director of the [[Naval Reactors]] office, wanted a boat capable of a burst of high speed in order to affect a safe &quot;getaway&quot; after launching the boat's payload. As a result, the ''Ohio'' class was designed to accommodate enormous nuclear reactors to produce the required speed. ''Ohio''-class submarines carry their missiles inside of their hulls, despite STRAT-X's recommendation.&lt;ref name=G10_55/&gt; ''Ohio''-class submarines and Trident missiles are still in service {{asof|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=FBMS/&gt;--&gt;

==Legacy==
STRAT-X had far-reaching effects on the development and deployment of U.S. nuclear forces. It was the first time that the strategic requirements of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] were addressed in a detailed and analytical manner.&lt;ref name=P&amp;M_184&gt;Polmar and Moore 2004, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 report by the [[RAND Corporation]], STRAT-X was described as &quot;one of the most influential analyses ever conducted&quot; for the [[U.S. Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt; Journalist Peter Grier, in his [[Air Force Magazine|''Air Force'' magazine]] article &quot;STRAT-X&quot;, described the study as &quot;a wide-ranging look at the future of U.S. weapons that shaped the nuclear triad for decades, and remains a model for such efforts today&quot;.&lt;ref name=G10_53/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP.com/&gt; In 2006, the [[Defense Science Board]] (DFS) noted STRAT-X's introduction of ideas and concepts that resulted in the ''Ohio''-class submarines and small and mobile ICBMs.&lt;ref name=G10_52/&gt; The DFS also attributed the use of air-launched [[cruise missile]]s, particularly those carried by the [[B-52 Stratofortress]], to STRAT-X despite their lack of references in the study.&lt;ref name=G10_55/&gt;
