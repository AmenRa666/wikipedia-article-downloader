'''William P. Levine''' (July 1, 1915 â€“ March 29, 2013) was a [[United States Army]] officer. During World War II, he served in the US Army as an [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|intelligence officer]]. Levine was among the first [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] to enter the [[Dachau concentration camp]] in Germany. He would eventually rise to the rank of Major General. After the war, he was active in the [[History of the Jews in Chicago|Chicago Jewish community]].

== Early life ==
Levine was born in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], to Joseph and Sadie Levine.&lt;ref name=&quot;patch1&quot;/&gt; He was the eldest of four brothers.&lt;ref name=ushmm/&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1937. After graduation, he worked in retail sales before being drafted into the Army in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;patch1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson |first=Jacob |url=http://highlandpark.patch.com/groups/obituaries/p/obituary-major-general-william-p-levine |title=Obituary: Major General William P. Levine|work=Highland Park Patch |date=5 April 2013 |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military career ==
Levine graduated from the [[Officer Candidate School (United States Army)|Army's Officer Candidate School]] in May 1943. He served with the 34th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group as an intelligence officer. His unit participated in the [[D-Day]] invasion on [[Utah Beach]], as well as the liberation of Dachau. The horrors Levine witnessed at Dachau would trouble him for the rest of his life. For a short time after the war, Levine assisted in the operation of a [[displaced persons camp]]. He assisted with the provision of food and clothing for, and the eventual resettlement of, more than 5,000 [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1&quot;/&gt;

During his military service, the Army sent him to engineering school so that he could acquire the skills to command a company of engineers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1&quot;/&gt;

Levine was discharged from active military service in 1946. He continued his service in the Army Reserve, as executive officer of the [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] in 1960 and rising to commanding officer in 1962. When the XIV Corps was deactivated in 1967, Levine was appointed commanding general of the U.S. Army's [[84th Division (United States)|84th Division (Training)]].  He was promoted to Major General later that year, the rank he would retire with in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1&quot;/&gt;

In retirement, Levine served as chairman of a retired officers association for the Army in the Midwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1&quot;/&gt;

During his military career, Levine was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] and [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;patch1&quot;/&gt;

== Civilian career ==
In 1946, Levine, his brothers, and his cousins founded a small plastics company in Duluth that molded advertising and display signs. In 1948, he moved to Chicago to establish the Lakeside Plastics Sales Co., a separate sales division for the plastics firm. He retired in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1&quot;/&gt;

After his retirement, Levine served as the construction project manager for many north suburban Jewish organizations. He supervised the building of the [[Schechter Day School Network|Solomon Schechter Day School]] in [[Northbrook, Illinois|Northbrook]] as well as two synagogues in [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]], Moriah Congregation and B'nai Tikvah. Levine also supervised the renovation of [[North Suburban Synagogue Beth El]] in [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1&quot;/&gt;

== Holocaust speaker ==
The scenes Levine witnessed when he entered Dachau concentration camp on April 29, 1945 were so terrible that he refused to speak about them, even to his family. However, Levine believed, &quot;the most important and effective method of preventing another Holocaust is truth and education&quot;. It was this belief that led to his speaking about his experience at Dachau nearly 40 years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1995&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-04-26/news/9504260192_1_holocaust-survivors-holocaust-remembrance-day-concentration-camp |title=Man Frees Holocaust Memories |work=Chicago Tribune|date=26 April 1995 |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levine attended a 40th anniversary memorial ceremony for the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] at [[Yad Vashem]] in [[Jerusalem]]. While at the cemetery, Maurice Pirot, a Belgian Jew, recognized Levine as one of his saviors, the soldier who had rescued him by carrying him in his arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;patch1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1995&quot;/&gt;

In May 1990, Levine recorded an oral history with the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]. He spoke about his life, wartime experience, and work with Holocaust victims.&lt;ref name=ushmm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn504623|title=Oral History Interview with William P. Levine|date=23 May 1990|accessdate=5 June 2014|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also spoke at Chicago's 1995 annual [[Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust|Holocaust Remembrance Day]]. He spoke about his experience and the experiences of the victims he met there.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1995&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
Levine married twice. His first wife, Leah Goldberg,&lt;ref name=&quot;patch1&quot;/&gt; died in 1975. In 1980,&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1&quot;/&gt; he remarried Rhoda Kreiter, who survived him.&lt;ref name=&quot;patch1&quot;/&gt; He had one son and four daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;patch1&quot;/&gt; 
  
Levine died of [[respiratory failure]] on March 29, 2013 in Highland Park, Illinois, at age 97.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first= Bob|last= Goldsborough|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-22/news/ct-met-general-levine-obit-20130422_1_levine-dachau-concentration-camp |title=William P.

== Legacy ==
The [[Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library]] maintains a William P. Levine Collection containing an assortment of Levine's World War II-era military documents, maps, photographs, and artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/explore/collection-highlights/named-collections/william-p-levine-collection/ |title=William P. Levine Collection  |publisher=[[Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library]] |date=1 July 1915 |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per the Chicago Firearms Ordinance, Levine's German [[Walther PP]] 7.65-mm. handgun, which he brought back to the United States after obtaining permission from the US Army, cannot be housed at the museum; it is stored with other handguns at a gun range in [[Lombard, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/15/exemption-sought-for-chicago-museums-to-display-historical-firearms/|title=Chicago gun laws bar museum from displaying Nazi weapon seized by WWII hero|first=Joshua Rhett|last=Miller|date=15 May 2013|accessdate=5 June 2014|work=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moriah Congregation in Deerfield, Illinois, has a flag circle dedicated to Levine. The flag circle and garden landscaping were dedicated on June 4, 2006 in the presence of then-[[United States House of Representatives|US Congressman]] [[Mark Kirk]] and [[Illinois House of Representatives|Illinois State Representative]] [[Karen May]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moriahcong.org/GeneralsGarden.htm |title=Major General William Levine's Garden |publisher=Moriah Congregation |date=4 June 2006 |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
