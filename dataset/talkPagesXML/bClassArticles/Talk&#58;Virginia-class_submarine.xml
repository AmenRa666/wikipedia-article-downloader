== SSN-780 name? ==
Can anyone confirm the name of SSN-780? Somehow I got the idea it was USS Massachusetts and was duly corrected. I found a reference from 2 July indicating it was going to be named California later in the month. [http://individual.com/story.php?story=67114213]

== Stats on US Subs ==
This is pretty typical for stats released on US subs, but they are gross underestimates.
[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ssn-688.htm] [http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ssn-21.htm]
FAS pins the Los Angeles class' submerge speed at about 32 knots, and test depth at 300 meters, but obviously they don't have the &quot;actual&quot; stats on the Virginia class subs. The seawolf seems to have a bit better stats too.
It should be quite safe to assume that the Virginia class would at least be as fast and as deep as the Los Angeles class that they're replacing.[[Submarine depth ratings]]
:Pretty much.  But all you'll get is &quot;can neither confirm, nor deny&quot; type answers.  Which, honestly, is the way it should be.  [[User:Izuko|Izuko]] 20:38, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

the seawolf class is a far more expensive submarine than the Virginia class and so it is most probabley more capable also slower speeds may mean it doesnt act as a part of a task group. lower speed subs are more stealthy and quite so they are better used hunting other subs instead of babysitting a carrier group.[[User:Corustar|Corustar]] 15:45, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

If there are no objections, I would like to include the information from Greg Palast's &lt;U&gt;Armed Madhouse&lt;/U&gt; concerning the Virginia-class submarines.  Palast is, in my opinion, quite accurate, but his writing is somewhat breezy and very partisan, so I will ensure that the information presented is straightforward and devoid of the whiff of conspiracy theory that permeates much of his writing. [[User:Black Max| Black Max]] 7-15-06

In the end.... the VA Class cost just as much as the Sea Wolf Class.... We as a country we stupid to build VA Class... Sea Wolf was a much more capable submarine for all missions....

::The Seawolf class lack VLS tubes. I see the VA as more flexible with its VLS. Also, the latest block shares commonality with the OH class; I imagine that makes maintenance cheaper. [[User:Jigen III|Jigen III]] ([[User talk:Jigen III|talk]]) 12:23, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

:Anybody got any information in what way the Seawolf class's is more capable? As Jigen said the weapon's mix of the VAs seems like the better solution for the foreseeable future. More noise?

::The Seawolfs have double the torpedo capacity of the Virginias, and Tomahawk cruise missiles can easily replace Mk 48 torpedoes on a one for one basis (they're roughly the same size and the Tomahawk was designed from day one to be compatible with 21-inch torpedo tubes). So even without the VLS tubes, a Seawolf can carry more torpedoes and more missiles than a Virginia. And if new Seawolfs were built it'd be easy to add VLS tubes to the design, just like we did with the later Los Angeles class subs.

The Seawolf's costs were not as low as you claim, Ex Submarine Radioman. In FY 1997 dollars, the three ships cost $13.185 B. To put that in FY 2014 dollars, that would be $19.146 billion! &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2000/navy/00ssn21.html&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, SSN 779, 780, and 781, cost $6.783 billion in FY 2005 dollars, which is $8.094 billion in FY 2014 dollars, that's a savings of over $11 billion from the Seawolf-class costs for three submarines. &lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=vWBxXUEZ13EC&amp;pg=PA1013&amp;lpg=PA1013&amp;dq=SSN+780+cost&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Glnx6TDnK_&amp;sig=gk4rQfWZ-Odk3r34nYRSJnlZCZ8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AXOyUv-KD4eCygGX_YCYBQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=SSN%20780%20cost&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; [[User:Calvinstrikesagain|Calvinstrikesagain]] ([[User talk:Calvinstrikesagain|talk]]) 04:25, 19 December 2013 (UTC)

==Use of Littoral?==

Do submarines really use the word ''littoral'' to describe near shore missions?  [[User:KP Botany|KP Botany]] 02:36, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

The U.S. Navy describes near shore waters as littoral so yes it is in the lexicon. [[User:Tirronan|Tirronan]] 14:15, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

==Is there a snorkel?==

I am working on the Submarine [[Snorkel]] article in Wikipedia and would like to know if the Virginia class subs have a small emergency diesel engine and snorkel capability like all previous US nuclear subs. Anybody know -- or how to find out?[[User:Tvbanfield|Tvbanfield]] 03:10, 11 May 2007 (UTC)

Yes, Virginia-class subs have diesels and snorkels.--[[User:Swt2c|Swt2c]] ([[User talk:Swt2c|talk]]) 20:33, 27 January 2008 (UTC)

no the sybmarines do not have a snorkel, this is because they have crated a system of air filters to clean the deisel exahust. also the snorkel can only be used on or near the surface, the new system provideds emergency power underwater also.

:The person who told you this clearly has no knowledge of subs and also has no knowledge of virginia class boats. 774 class boats do have an emergency diesel which does take suction through a snorkle mast.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/97.253.65.166|97.253.65.166]] ([[User talk:97.253.65.166|talk]]) 21:15, 15 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

However without a snorkel they would have to burn the oxygen stored for other ship functions such as life support and im sure the oxygen generator/scrubbers would not be able to keep up for more than a dozen hours or so if that.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/83.104.138.141|83.104.138.141]] ([[User talk:83.104.138.141|talk]]) 23:48, 17 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The ''Virginia''s do, in fact have a snorkel.  There's a [http://www.navy.mil/management/photodb/photos/040822-N-2653P-344.jpg photo] of the ''USS Virginia'' Diesel Generator Control Panel on the US Navy web site.

The designer notes that under the heading 'Photo 344' [[User:Kc2hiz|Buck]] ([[User talk:Kc2hiz|talk]]) 20:43, 19 March 2009 (UTC)

Virginia class doesn't have snorkel.Modern submarines are using chemical reaction, so called electrolysing water, to tear apart water molecules H2O to gases H and O.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/188.2.97.60|188.2.97.60]] ([[User talk:188.2.97.60|talk]]) 14:28, 9 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

All diesel powered subs and all nuclear powered subs have some type of snorkel mast and snorkel valve mechanisms to support outside air induction when the boat is at a depth that allows snorkling operations. Let's define the purpose of snorkling operations. A diesel powered sub snorkels to charge its batteries. A nuclear powered sub snorkels to support starting the reactor. A sub in casualty or distress snorkels to prevent humans inside from suffocating, when air scrubbers are down (another backup is burning O2 candles).  The above statement about a 'system of air filters to clean the deisel exahust' is nonsense. The links to my DGCP page (above) is a great example.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Gary84|Gary84]] ([[User talk:Gary84|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gary84|contribs]]) 05:48, 10 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I honestly doubt that they will name another ship the USS Arizona because I believe its name is still on the Naval Registery. I think that they should name a couple of subs the Puerto Rico and Samoa because they are US Territories and there names haven't been used in many years but it would also be nice to see another USS Oklahoma again. tom991

== Measurements ==

Why does this U.S. vessel, which has its specifications reported by the U.S. Navy in U.S. measurements, have its &quot;displacement&quot; stats reported in British/metric units?

Very annoying.

The Virginia class is reported by the Navy as having 7,800 tons of displacement.  That's &lt;big&gt;tons&lt;/big&gt;...not &quot;metric tons&quot;...nor &quot;long tons&quot;...nor &quot;short tons&quot; for that matter...just tons, which is widely understood by the high and low tech communities as being 2,000 pounds.  

Can I get an amen?

: The above statement is incorrect. Measurements of all navy vessels are in long tons, always. 1 Lton = 2,240 lbs.

==Virginia class submarine GAN==
Hi, I notice that this article has been nominated for GA. Unfortunately, I don't have time to do the GA review (nor do I have the specific knowledge required), however, I thought if I gave a couple of quick comments that they might be able to be dealt with prior to someone doing the GA review and this might help the nomination to be successful. These are my comments:
* the lead might need to be expanded;
* some of the citations are dead links, these should be rectified before the review;
* some of the citations are missing publisher and accessdate details;
* some of the citations are not formatted and are appearing as bare urls, I suggest formatting with the {{tl|cite web}} template;
* some of the Specifications don't appear to be cited;
* there is a citation needed tag which needs to be dealt with;
* a number of paragraphs end without a citation, these should be added even if they are just duplications of previous citations;
* there are a number of single sentence paragraphs, perhaps consider consolidating these or expanding them;
* the History section consists of only one short paragraph - could this be expanded? Perhaps you could discuss the history of the name &quot;Virginia&quot; in relation to other ships/classes. Also, do you know why the name changed?
* the image stacking is causing quite a bit of whitespace on my screen (although this might just be because I'm viewing from an old clunker). Perhaps you might consider removing some, or tweaking their placement.

Would be good to state the total number of torpedos and Harpoons the sub can  carry as with the other SSN pages[[User:Foxhound66|Other dictionaries are better]] ([[User talk:Foxhound66|talk]]) 10:28, 12 April 2011 (UTC)

== Relevance of the acoustic stealth comparison ==

Is this plot really relevant for an encyclopedia ? The magnitude of the ordinate is not rigorously specified. Besides, the source connot be correctly checked. 
Moreover, little information is known in general about the acoustic signature of submarine.  It can just be, at the best, globally assessed. If one had to talk about acoustic signature,  it would be more proper to include the uncertainty on the noise level, which has to be defined more rigorousely. Lastly, how is it possible to assess the acoustic signature of the Severodvinsk class SSN as it is not yet operational?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Fulcrum-35|Fulcrum-35]] ([[User talk:Fulcrum-35|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fulcrum-35|contribs]]) 21:05, 26 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


==Sub-Harpoon==
How come Harpoons are not included? Is this source reliable?

== Price-tag ==

Sorry, but can somebody take a closer look at this ?
I see two totally different figures. The text states 1.8 billion, even less, while the table states 2.4 billion dollars. Which one is correct ? [[Special:Contributions/212.61.161.171|212.61.161.171]] ([[User talk:212.61.161.171|talk]]) 16:01, 6 February 2012 (UTC)

WSJ page A2 on May 28, 2014 says &quot;The US Navy placed a record  $17.6 Billion order for 10 new Virginia class submarines from General Dynamics Corp and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.&quot;  This indicates the $1.8 B figure is still on track.

== Needs temporal update ==

Seems to me that parts of this article should be rewritten to show that time has passed since those paragraphs were written. As of for example, it refers to future procurement plans in 2011-12 in future tense. Can any of the main contributors or original editors please help?

== Reactor power ==

The reactor power rating is currently just a conversion of the stated shaft horsepower. Without some discussion of the necessity of the reactor thermal power being much higher than this, it should just say unknown. The idea that a 30MW reactor powers this thing is absurd.[[Special:Contributions/50.147.26.108|50.147.26.108]] ([[User talk:50.147.26.108|talk]]) 22:53, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

== Blacklisted Links Found on the Main Page ==

Cyberbot II has detected that page contains external links that have either been globally or locally blacklisted.
Links tend to be blacklisted because they have a history of being spammed, or are highly innappropriate for Wikipedia.
This, however, doesn't necessarily mean it's spam, or not a good link.
If the link is a good link, you may wish to request whitelisting by going to the [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist|request page for whitelisting]].
If you feel the link being caught by the blacklist is a false positive, or no longer needed on the blacklist, you may request the regex be removed or altered at the [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-blacklist|blacklist request page]].
If the link is blacklisted globally and you feel the above applies you may request to whitelist it using the before mentioned request page, or request its removal, or alteration, at the [[meta:Talk:Spam Blacklist|request page on meta]].
When requesting whitelisting, be sure to supply the link to be whitelisted and wrap the link in nowiki tags.
The whitelisting process can take its time so once a request has been filled out, you may set the invisible parameter on the tag to true.
Please be aware that the bot will replace removed tags, and will remove misplaced tags regularly.

'''Below is a list of links that were found on the main page:'''

*&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/nssn/&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*:''Triggered by &lt;code&gt;\bnaval-technology\.com\b&lt;/code&gt; on the local blacklist''

If you would like me to provide more information on the talk page, contact [[User:Cyberpower678]] and ask him to program me with more info.
