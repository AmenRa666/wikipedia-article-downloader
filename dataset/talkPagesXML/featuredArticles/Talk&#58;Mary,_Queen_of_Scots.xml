== James V deathbed quote ==

There is indeed more than one version of what James V said on his deathbed but I know of no source which claims it to be &quot;It came with a lass, it will pass with a lass!&quot;, what's more anachronistically in modern standard English. The footnote claims this to be the version of Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie and this is plain false as his quote, understandably in contemporary Scots, is &quot;Fairweill, it cam with ane las, it will pas with ane las.&quot;. The version used in the article should be a notable version of the quote, such as Lindsay's, and should not be altered, misquoted or misattributed, as it is in the current version. At the very least a linked reference to Lindsay's text, as I provided, should be given. Personally, I am more familiar with the &quot;It cam wi a lass and it will gang wi a lass&quot; version and think it more widespread in use as a quote but am not sure of its origin and Lindsay's version is near contemporary and notable so am happy with it, if correctly quoted and attributed. If we really must translate it into modern English, of doubtful necessity as the Scots and English in this instance are arguably close enough for comprehensibility, we should say we have done so, provide the translation in brackets after the verbatim quote or provide it in the footnote. The use of the [[apologetic apostrophe]], per the &quot;gang&quot; version in the footnote, is anachronistic for the 16th century and is long deprecated in modern Scots. [[User:Mutt Lunker|Mutt Lunker]] ([[User talk:Mutt Lunker|talk]]) 09:08, 2 April 2015 (UTC)
:The version given in the body of the article is the version given by both Fraser &lt;s&gt;and Wormald&lt;/s&gt; and Guy. [[User:DrKiernan|DrKiernan]] ([[User talk:DrKiernan|talk]]) 12:29, 2 April 2015 (UTC)
:Google searches easily demonstrate that the normal spelling is &quot;It came with a lass&quot;, even by  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f3NbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=%22It+came+with+a+lass%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oDYdVZ3LAeq17gb_gYGQDw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22It%20came%20with%20a%20lass%22&amp;f=false Lindsay]. [[User:DrKiernan|DrKiernan]] ([[User talk:DrKiernan|talk]]) 12:35, 2 April 2015 (UTC)
::That is evidently a 1728 translation into 18th century English. Per my edit and this untranslated edition, what Lindsay in fact said was:
::&quot;Fairweill, it cam with ane las, it will pas with ane las!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindsay of Pitscottie|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie|editor1-last=Dalyell|editor1-first=John Graham|editor1-link=John Graham Dalyell|title=The Cronicles of Scotland, Volume Second|date=1814|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Company; Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme &amp; Brown|location=Edinburgh; London|page=406|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nQoHAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=mary#v=snippet&amp;q=it%20cam%20with%20ane%20las%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 April 2015|language=Scots|quote=Fairweill, it cam with ane las, it will pas with ane las:}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::If we are going to quote Lindsay we should make it plain we are quoting from a later translation, as the work cited in the current footnote actually is, or from a 1980s translation or from a 1990s one. Better still we can give it in Lindsay's original.
::&quot;It came with a lass&quot; is certainly not the normal spelling. &quot;It cam wi a lass and it will gang wi a lass&quot; is overwhelmingly the version in use and even Betty's website doesn't go all [[pan loaf]]y with the quote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/Scottish%20Monarchs%28400ad-1603%29/TheStewarts/JamesV.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; As I said though, am happy to go with the correct rendition of Lindsay's version. [[User:Mutt Lunker|Mutt Lunker]] ([[User talk:Mutt Lunker|talk]]) 15:09, 2 April 2015 (UTC)
:::I'm sorry, I made a mistake above which arose from reading my notes rather than the actual source. I have corrected it.
:::According to my notes, &quot;It came with a lass&quot; is given by Guy [which I no longer own] and Fraser [which I have confirmed by looking in the book], and &quot;It cam wi' a lass&quot; is given by Wormald [which I have confirmed by looking in the book] and by Weir [which I borrowed from a library and would have to consult after Easter if necessary as I do not have a copy myself]. &quot;It came from a woman&quot; is in Wormald [confirmed] and Guy and Weir [according to my notes]. As Wormald is the source used in the article, I have amended the article text to match what Wormald says. As the Knox version, &quot;It came from a woman&quot;, is in 3 secondary sources, and is older than Lindsay, I think it should be included as a notable version. The &quot;It cam with ane las&quot; version is only found, as I far as I can tell, in the 1814 copy of Lindsay and so as it is not apparently used by any secondary or modern source and is rare, I think it inappropriate to use it here. My opinion on whether other versions or translations (such as &quot;It came with a lass&quot; or &quot;pass wi a lass&quot;) should be included is not yet fixed. In the meantime, I have removed &quot;It came with a lass&quot;. [[User:DrKiernan|DrKiernan]] ([[User talk:DrKiernan|talk]]) 16:26, 2 April 2015 (UTC)
::::No worries. I would agree that the Lindsay quote is not well known, am not particualarly advocating it and was addressing it since the footnote claimed him to be the source of the anglicised &quot;came&quot; version then in the article. Unintentional in your recent edit I assume, the article's footnote now claims Lindsay to be the source of the &quot;gang&quot; version of the quote, so that will also need to be addressed. When you say that &quot;&quot;It cam wi' a lass&quot; is given by Wormald&quot;&quot;, that is the &quot;...and it will gang wi a lass&quot;&quot; version now in the article I assume? Out of interest, does she indicate the original source of that? And does she use the accursed apologetic apostrophes (in which case she ought to know better I'd have thought)? Knox's version is unquestionably notable. I'm not surprised that he would phrase it in a more anglicised way, given his background, but believe his rendering was very slightly different, &quot;The devill go with it! It will end as it begane: it came from a woman; and it will end in a woman.&quot; (&quot;devill&quot;, &quot;begane&quot;, &quot;in&quot; not &quot;from&quot; a woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6QEMAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%22It+came+from+a+woman%22+knox&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FH0dVa7GCYO8aafygJAF&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22It%20came%20from%20a%20woman%22%20knox&amp;f=false|title=Publications 1-12: Knox, J.

== Navbox ==

{{tl|English, Scottish and British monarchs}} is a more relevant template than {{tl|Pictish and Scottish monarchs}} at this article because Henry VII (her great-grandfather), Henry VIII (her great-uncle), Edward VI (her putative fiance) and Elizabeth I (her rival and jailor) are all important to her story while the Pictish monarchs are of no relevance. It is also been used on this article for a long time, including the entire time this article has been featured, and per [[WP:CONSENSUS]] and [[WP:BRD]], the longstanding template should be retained until consensus changes. [[User:DrKiernan|DrKiernan]] ([[User talk:DrKiernan|talk]]) 18:16, 4 August 2015 (UTC)

:Your rationale is illogical, you appear to be confusing a monarchs template with a &quot;see also&quot; section. The Scottish monarchs template, which indeed does include indistinguishable Pictish monarchs, covers all Scottish monarchs including Mary, Queen of Scots, and as you can see from other articles is used for Scottish monarchs on Wikipedia. The purpose of your edit warring on this topic appears to be to make Mary an exception to this. The British template is anachronistic, I don't understand why you would want it in this article. British nationalism maybe?  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.44.64.116|80.44.64.116]] ([[User talk:80.44.64.116|talk]]) 18:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:::: I explained why the template is wrong. What else is there to discuss? Why the fuck would you use a British template for Scottish monarchs? Why the fucking fuck would Mary be the sole pre-union monarch to use a British template? Oh, that's right, nationalism. 
:::: No, my bad, Kiernan removed the N. Irish flag from another article. Also I forgot, Mary had diplomatic relations with Elizabeth I of England. Makes total sense, you should put the Danish and Polish monarchs in the template too. We'll have a giant Mary template instead of the see also section other articles have.

Actually, I swore AND expounded. It is possible to do both in the post-Kindergarten world, as you can see above.

The guideline is [[WP:NAVBOX]]; all four navboxes seem to more or less fit the five criteria, none much better than the others, and I really don't see why this is worth edit-warring over. Can we just add both? [[User:FourViolas|FourViolas]] ([[User talk:FourViolas|talk]]) 18:51, 6 August 2015 (UTC)

== Last letter... ==

I noticed that the National Library of Scotland has released some nice, copyright free images of Mary's final letter on their Flickr photostream, here [https://www.flickr.com/photos/nlscotland/4401152368/in/photolist-9bNoc5-9bHBJg-8TPbqR-8az1F9-8TPaXX-834SuT-8TSf4C-7GV4hb-7GV4go-7GV4im-8ahBnH-7GR8wZ/] - might be of interest for the article.

== Name in Scots and Gaelic ==

Maybe we need her name in Gaelic and Scots.And what is her full title used in Scotland and France?  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/183.16.171.24|183.16.171.24]] ([[User talk:183.16.171.24#top|talk]]) 12:07, 16 November 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
