'''Philippe François Marie Leclerc de Hauteclocque''' ({{IPA-fr|filip ləklɛʁ də otklɔk}}; 22 November 1902&amp;nbsp;– 28 November 1947) was a French general during the [[Second World War]]. He became [[Marshal of France]] posthumously in 1952, and is known in France simply as '''le maréchal Leclerc''' or just '''Leclerc'''.

The son of an aristocratic family, de Hauteclocque graduated from the ''[[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]]'', the French military academy, in 1924. After service with the French [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] and in Morocco, he returned to Saint-Cyr as an instructor. He was awarded the ''[[croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures]]'' for leading ''[[goumier]]s'' in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August 1933. During the Second World War he fought in the [[Battle of France]]. He then became one of the first to make his way to Britain to fight with the [[Free French]] under General [[Charles de Gaulle]], adopting the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' of Leclerc so that his wife and children would not be put at risk if his name appeared in the papers. He was sent to [[French Equatorial Africa]], where he rallied local leaders to the Free French cause, and led a [[Battle of Gabon|force against Gabon]], whose leaders supported [[Vichy France]]. From [[Chad]] he led raids into Italian-controlled [[Libya]]. After his forces [[Battle of Kufra (1941)|captured Kufra]], he had his men swear an oath known today as the ''Serment de Koufra'', in which they pledged to fight on until their flag flew over the [[Strasbourg Cathedral]].

The forces under his command, known as L Force, campaigned in Libya in 1943, covered the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]'s inland flank during its advance into Tunisia, and participated in the [[Operation Pugilist|attack on the Mareth Line]]. L Force was then transformed into the ''[[2nd Armored Division (France)|2e Division Blindée]]'', although it was often referred to as ''La Division Leclerc''. It fought under Leclerc's command in the [[Battle of Normandy]], and participated in the [[liberation of Paris]] and [[Strasbourg]]. After the [[end of World War II in Europe]] in May 1945, he was given command of the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] (''Corps expéditionnaire français en Extrême-Orient'', CEFEO). He represented France at the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|surrender of the Japanese Empire]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] on 2 September 1945. He quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the nascent [[First Indochina War|conflict in Indochina]], but once again was ahead of his countrymen, and was recalled to France in 1946. He was killed in an air crash in Algeria in 1947.

==Ancestry and family==
{{main|House of Hauteclocque}}
Philippe François Marie de Hauteclocque was born on 22 November 1902 at [[Belloy-Saint-Léonard]] in the department of [[Somme (department)|Somme]]. He was the fifth of six children of Adrien de Hauteclocque, comte de Hauteclocque (1864–1945), and Marie-Thérèse van der Cruisse de Waziers (1870–1956). Philippe was named in honour of an ancestor killed by [[Croats]] in 1635.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|p=34}}

[[File:Blason Philippe Marie Leclerc de Hautecloque (1902-1947).svg|thumb|left|upright|150px|Coat of arms of the counts of Hauteclocque|alt=A white shield with red cross containing five inverted shells.]]
De Hauteclocque came from an old line of country nobility. His direct ancestors had served in the [[Fifth Crusade]] against Egypt, and again in the [[Eighth Crusade]] of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] against Tunisia in 1270. They had also fought at the [[Battle of Saint-Omer]] in 1340 and the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] in 1745. The family managed to survive the [[French Revolution]]. Three members of the family served in [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] ''[[Grande Armée]]'' and a fourth, who suffered from weak health, served in the supply train.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|p=34}} The third son, Constantin, who had served in Napoleon's [[Russian Campaign]], was created a ''[[knighthood|chevalier]]'' by King [[Louis XVIII]], and a [[Papal count]] by Pope [[Pius IX]] in 1857. Constantin had two sons. The older, Alfred Francois Marie (1822–1902), died childless. The younger, Gustave Francois Marie Joseph (1829–1914), became a noted [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]].{{sfn|Clayton|1992|p=34}}{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=16}}

Gustave, in turn, had three sons. The first, Henry (1862–1914), and third, Wallerand (1866–1914), became officers in the French Army, serving during the colonial campaigns, including fighting [[Samory]] in the Sudan. Both were killed in the early fighting of the [[First World War]]. The second son was Adrien, who enlisted in August 1914 as a trooper in the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|11e Régiment de Chasseurs à Cheval|fr}}'', the regiment in which his son Guy was a [[cornet]]. Adrien was later commissioned, and was twice awarded the ''[[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]]'' for gallantry. He survived the war, and inherited the family title and estate in Belloy-Saint-Léonard.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|p=34}}{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=16}}

==Early life==
Philippe de Hauteclocque was homeschooled until he was 13, when he was sent to '' L'école de la Providence'', a [[Jesuit]] school in [[Amiens]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=16}} In 1920, at the age of 17, he went to ''[[Lycée privé Sainte-Geneviève]]'', known as ''Ginette'', a [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|preparatory school]] in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=20}} He then entered the ''[[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]]'', the French military academy. Each class has a name; his was ''Metz et Strasbourg'' after towns in [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] returned to France by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. He graduated on 1 October 1924, and was commissioned as a ''[[sous lieutenant]]'' in the [[French Army]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=24}} Having chosen the cavalry branch, he then had to attend the [[Armoured Cavalry Branch Training School|Cavalry School]] in [[Saumur]], from which he graduated first in his class on 8 August 1925.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=25–26}}

De Hauteclocque's older brother Guy had married Madeleine de Gargan, the daughter of the Baron de Gargan. Philippe became a frequent visitor to the Gargan household, and became enchanted by Madeleine's youngest sister Thérèse. The two courted while he was at Saint-Cyr. In the tradition of old noble families, Count Adrien asked Baron de Gargan for permission for Philippe to marry Thérèse. The wedding ceremony took place in the [[Church of St Joan of Arc]] in [[Rouen]] on 10 August 1925. For a wedding present, Adrien gave them a chateau in [[Tailly, Somme|Tailly]]. They had six children:{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=25–26}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictionnaire des noms de rues&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ville-avrille.fr/BdR_Leclerc-av-du-Mal.html |publisher=Dictionnaire des noms de rues |title=Leclerc (avenue du maréchal) |language=French |accessdate=14 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henri (1926–1952), who was later killed in the [[First Indochina War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fondation-leclerc.com/44/leclerc-et-ses-hommes/compagnons-tombes-pour-la-france/indochine/henri-leclerc-hauteclocque_9.htm |language=French |title=Indochine : octobre 1945 – juillet 1946 |publisher= Fondation Leclerc de Hauteclocque |accessdate=16 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubert (1927–), who served as mayor of Tailly from 2001 to 2008;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.annuaire-mairie.fr/elections-municipales-tailly-80.html |publisher=Annuaire-Mairie |title=Résultats des élections municipales à Tailly |language=French |accessdate=14 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles (1929–); Jeanne (1931–); Michel (1933–2014); and Bénédicte (1936–).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geneanet.org/archives/releves/publi/publication/saorsel/HistoFam/Diesbach/GENEALOGIE%20de%20%20Hauteclocque.pdf |language=French |publisher=Geneanet |title=Famille de Hauteclocque |accessdate=14 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe and Thérèse hired an Austrian governess, and spoke German in front of their children to improve their command of the language.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=48}}

Having graduated from Saumur, de Hauteclocque joined his regiment, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|5e Régiment de Cuirassiers|fr}}'', which was then on occupation duty in [[Trier]] as part of the French [[occupation of the Ruhr]]. Garrison duty was not to his liking, so he volunteered for service with the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|8e Régiment de Spahis Marocains|fr}}'', based at [[Taza]] in Morocco. He was promoted to ''lieutenant'' in October 1926. In 1927, he was posted as an instructor at the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|École militaire de Dar El Beida|fr}}'' at [[Meknes]], the military academy of French Morocco. Here, he met {{Interlanguage link multi|Paul de Langlade|fr}}, a First World War veteran eight years his senior, who would later volunteer to serve under his command. In 1929, he was attached to the ''38e Goum Mixte Marocains'', a [[Moroccan Goumier]] unit at M'Zizel in the [[Atlas Mountains]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=27–30}} He saw action in the fighting against the [[Ait Hammou]] guerrillas. In one action, two horses were shot out from under him.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|p=36}} Afterwards, he was posted to the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|1er Régiment de Chasseurs d'Afrique|fr}}, ''the senior cavalry regiment of the ''[[Armée d'Afrique]]'', based at [[Rabat]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=34}}

In February 1931, de Hauteclocque went back to Saint-Cyr as an instructor, but wanted to return to active service. During the summer break in 1933, he flew south to Africa, where he reported to ''Général de brigade'' [[Henri Giraud]] on 11 July. Giraud sent him into the field as a liaison officer with a ''goum''. He was awarded the ''[[croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures]]'' for leading ''goumiers'' in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=36–38}} The Commander in Chief in Morocco, ''[[Général de division]]'' [[Antoine Huré]], felt that de Hauteclocque should not have been there, and held the award up for three years. Others felt differently, and de Hauteclocque was given early admission to the course for promotion to ''[[Captain (OF-2)|capitaine]]''. He placed fourth in the class, and was promoted on 25 December 1934.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|p=36}}&lt;ref name=&quot;memorial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memorial-genweb.org/~memorial2/html/div/complement.php?table=bp98&amp;id=1644277 |publisher=Mémorial-GenWeb |title=Leclerc De Hautecloque, Philippe François Marie |language=French |accessdate=14 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion was slow in the inter-war French Army, especially in the cavalry, and he was only the second in his Saint-Cyr class to reach that rank. Most had to wait until 1936.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=45–46}} He was also made a ''Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur''.&lt;ref name=&quot;decorations&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_compagnon/569.html |title=Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque |publisher=|language=French |accessdate=14 May 2014|date=7 February 2011|work=Ordre de la Libération |author=Conseil national des communes &quot;Compagnon de la Libération&quot;  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they were devout Catholics, de Hauteclocque and Thérèse subscribed to ''[[Action Française]]'', the journal of a far-right political organisation of the same name, despite a papal [[interdict]] against it, and continued to do so even after Thérèse was refused [[absolution]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=27}} In contrast, his cousin {{Interlanguage link multi|Xavier de Hauteclocque|fr}} was an award-winning journalist who covered the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany, visited the [[concentration camp]] at [[Dachau]], and wrote about the [[Night of Long Knives]]. Xavier died in April 1935, convinced that he had been poisoned by the Nazis.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=42}} After the [[Second World War]], de Hauteclocque destroyed his copies of ''Action Française''.{{sfn|Vézinet|1974|p=34}}

De Hauteclocque broke his leg in two places in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company that it was his own fault for riding on the shoulder of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|p=37}}{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=45–46}}

In November 1938, de Hauteclocque entered the ''[[École supérieure de guerre]]'', the French Army's staff college, as part of its 60th class. On graduating in July 1939, he was ordered to report to the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|4th Infantry Division (France)|fr|3=4e division d'infanterie (France)|lt=4e Division d'Infanterie}}'' (4e DI) as its chief of staff.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=47–49}}

==Fall of France==
{{main|Fall of France}}
On 10 May 1940, Germany [[German invasion of Luxembourg in World War II|invaded Luxembourg]], [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], and [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]]. The 4e DI was ordered to hold the line of the [[Sambre]] river. De Hauteclocque was placed in charge of three infantry [[battalion]]s. To his dismay, orders came to pull back to the [[Canal de l'Escaut]]. From there the 4e DI retreated northward, becoming encircled in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Lille pocket]] on 28 May. De Hauteclocque received permission to escape through German lines.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=51–54}} He attempted to make his way back to the French lines by pretending to be a civilian refugee, but was apprehended by a German patrol and taken prisoner when they discovered an old military pay receipt. He was taken back to a German command post, where he secretly destroyed the receipt. He convinced a German colonel that he had been wounded in Morocco, suffered from [[malaria]], and had six children, all of which was true, and he was thus exempted from military service, which was false. The Germans let him go. He then made his way to the [[Canal de Saint-Quentin|Crozat Canal]], swam across, and encountered a French patrol.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=56–58}}

[[File:Tanks B1 bis (Toulal) zu Stonne.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Char B1]] tank. French tanks were usually given names by their crews.|alt=A tank painted with green and brown camouflage colours sits on a hard stand. There is an inscription plaque in front of it.]]
De Hauteclocque reported to the headquarters of ''[[Général d'armée]]'' {{Interlanguage link multi|Aubert Frère|fr}}, the commander of the [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh Army]], who gave him permission to visit his home at Tailly, which was still behind French lines. When he got there, however, he found that Thérèse had fled to [[Sainte-Foy-la-Grande]] in the southwest of France, where she had relatives. On returning to the Seventh Army, he was ordered to join the ''2eme groupement cuirassée,'' a scratch force of armoured and mechanised units that included [[Generał brygady|Brigadier General]] [[Stanisław Maczek]]'s [[10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade (Poland)|Polish 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade]]. The ''groupement '' launched a series of counter-attacks. Lacking a radio, de Hauteclocque gave directions to the [[Char B1]] tanks with his cane.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=58–59}} On 15 June, he was wounded in the head during a German air attack, and was taken to a hospital in a convent in [[Avallon]]. There he was again taken prisoner when the area was overrun by the Germans.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|p=41}}

This time, de Hauteclocque escaped by jumping out a window.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=64}} After the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|armistice]] was signed on 22 June, French soldiers who had not been captured were simply allowed to go home, and the Germans were friendly towards de Hauteclocque, especially when they discovered that he spoke fluent German. He made his way to rejoin his family by car and bicycle. So that he could cross from the [[zone occupée]] into the [[zone libre]] where Thérèse and the children were, his sister Yvonne obtained an identity card for him in the name of &quot;Leclerc&quot;. It was his first use of this name. He also told Yvonne that he intended to join ''Général de brigade'' [[Charles de Gaulle]] in Britain. He was reunited with his family in [[Saint-Germain-les-Vergnes]] on 30 June but stayed with them for only four days before setting out for Spain.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=66–68}} He managed to obtain a visa on the second attempt, being refused the first time for carrying too much money with him. Once in Spain he took a train to [[Madrid]], and then to [[Lisbon]], where he went to the British embassy, which arranged his passage to Britain on a merchant ship, the SS ''Hillary''.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|p=42}}

==Africa==
De Hauteclocque arrived in London on 25 July 1940, and met with de Gaulle, who announced that he was promoting him to ''[[Chef d'Escadrons]]'' (major). He also encountered his cousin Pierre de Hauteclocque, Xavier's brother, who was serving with the ''[[13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion|13e Demi-Brigade de Légion Étrangère]]''. This was the largest unit that had joined the [[Free French Forces]]. After participating in the [[Battles of Narvik]], it had found itself in Britain when France surrendered. Formed after the war began, it contained many men who had fought for the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican cause]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and many refugees from Nazi and Fascist countries. De Hauteclocque then offered his own services to the unit, but its commander, ''[[Colonel]]'' [[Raoul Magrin-Vernerey]], rejected his offer on the grounds that he was high-born, over-qualified and a cavalryman.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=73}}

Instead, in August 1940, de Gaulle ordered de Hauteclocque to [[French Equatorial Africa]], where the local leaders had declared themselves for Free France, as the [[List of colonial heads of French Cameroon|governor of French Cameroon]].{{sfn|Keegan|1982|pp=299–300}} At this time he adopted Leclerc as his ''[[nom de guerre]]'', so that Thérèse and their children would not be put at risk if his name appeared in the papers.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=74}}  He quickly secured the Free French grip on Cameroon. He then led a force consisting of the 13e DBLE and [[Senegalese Tirailleurs]] against [[Gabon]], whose local leader supported [[Vichy France]]. The [[Battle of Gabon]] lasted from 12 October to 12 November 1940, and ended with 20 dead and Gabon in Free French hands. Vichy prisoners were held as hostages in case Vichy France tried to retaliate against the families of Free Frenchmen. When [[Louis-Michel-François Tardy]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Libreville|Bishop of Libreville]], refused to conduct a [[Mass (Catholic Church)|mass]] to celebrate the victory, Leclerc had him arrested.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|pp=45–46}} ''[[Capitaine de corvette]]'' [[Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu]] conducted the service in his capacity as a [[Secular Order of Discalced Carmelites|Carmelite]] priest.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=91}}

[[File:Serment de Koufra 2 mars 1941.JPG|thumb|right|Serment de Koufra|alt=An inscription in stone, in French. It reads: &quot;Jurez de ne déposer les armes que le jour où nos couleurs, nos belles couleurs flotteront sur la cathédrale de Strasbourg. 2 Mars 1941&quot;]]
With Gabon in hand, de Gaulle sent Leclerc to [[Chad]], the only Free French territory that shared a border with territory controlled by [[Axis Powers]], along its [[Sahara Desert]] border with [[Italian Libya|Italian-controlled Libya]]. Leclerc's attention was drawn to two Italian outposts in the desert, [[Murzuk]] in southwestern Libya and [[Kufra]] in the southeast. Both were over {{convert|1000|mi}} from his base at [[N'Jamena|Fort Lamy]] in Chad. He started with a small raid on Murzuk by eleven men of the ''[[Régiment de Tirailleurs Sénégalais du Tchad]]'' (RTST) and two [[troop]]s of the British [[Long Range Desert Group]] (LRDG) on 11 January 1941. In February, he led a much larger operation that [[Battle of Kufra (1941)|captured Kufra]].{{sfn|Clayton|1992|pp=46–48}} After the battle, he had his men swear an oath known today as the ''Serment de Koufra'' (&quot;Oath of Kufra&quot;):

Leclerc learnt a great deal about how to handle and supply a force advancing across the desert, and was rewarded with the British [[Distinguished Service Order]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=126}} He began planning a far more ambitious advance into Libya. This was delayed by a year due to ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]]'s defeat of the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] in the [[Battle of Gazala]], and the subsequent German and Italian advance into Egypt.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|pp=48–61}} Leclerc was promoted to ''Général de brigade'' in August 1941, and pinned two metal stars captured from the Italians on his ''kepi''.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=147, 152}}

De Gaulle ordered the plan for an advance into Libya to be put in motion in the wake of the Eighth Army's victory in the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. Leclerc set out from Fort Lamy on 16 December 1942 with 500 European and 2,700 African troops in 350 vehicles. He captured [[Sebha]] on 12 January 1943, and [[Mizdah]] on 22 January. He reached [[Tripoli]] on 26 January, where he was greeted by the Eighth Army's commander, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]. Leclerc's command, now reinforced by the Greek [[Sacred Band (World War II)|Sacred Squadron]], and known as L Force, covered the Eighth Army's inland flank during its advance into Tunisia. L Force beat off a German counterattack on 10 March, and participated in the [[Operation Pugilist|attack on the Mareth Line]].{{sfn|Clayton|1992|pp=48–61}}

==Western Europe==
After the fighting in North Africa ended, Leclerc's L Force, now about 4,000 strong, became the ''2e Division Française Libre'' (2e DFL). In June 1943, de Gaulle informed him the 2e DFL would be re-equipped by the Americans as an armoured division, the ''[[2nd Armored Division (France)|2e Division Blindée]]'' (2&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; DB). It was often called ''La Division Leclerc''. Although organised along American lines, its units had French titles. The non-white units were transferred out. The remainder of 2e DFL became the ''[[Regiment de Marche du Tchad]]'' (RMT), 2e DB's motorised infantry regiment. Free French armoured units serving with the Eighth Army became the [[501e Régiment de chars de combat]] 501&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; RCC. The artillery and the other two armoured regiments of 2e DB, the ''[[12th Cuirassier Regiment (France)|12e Régiment de Cuirassiers]]'' (12e RC) and the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|12e Régiment de Chasseurs d'Afrique|fr|3=12e régiment de chasseurs d'Afrique}}'' (12e RCA), were drawn from the Vichy ''Armée d'Afrique''.{{sfn|Keegan|1982|pp=299–300}} {{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=199–203}} Perhaps the most unusual unit in the division was the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Régiment Blindé de Fusiliers-Marins|fr|3=Régiment blindé de fusiliers-marins}}'' (RBFM), sailors who served as a [[tank destroyer]] regiment.{{sfn|Keegan|1982|p=303}}{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=223–226}} Leclerc had to weld the various units, some of whom had recently been fighting against the Allies, into a team. This was no easy task. When two men from the 501e RCC upset a former Vichy officer by singing a disrespectful song about ''Général d'armée'' Henri Giraud, resulting in a fight, he told the officer concerned that respect had to be earned.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=216}}

In April 1944, 2e DB was shipped to Britain to participate in [[Operation Overlord]], the Allied invasion of northern France. Leclerc and his staff travelled by air in a converted [[B-24 Liberator]] bomber.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=228–230}} The division moved to training areas in [[Yorkshire]], where Leclerc established his headquarters on the estate of [[Henry Frederick Hotham, 7th Baron Hotham]], at [[Dalton Hall (Beverley)|Dalton Hall]], [[Beverley]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=234–235}} Training was conducted in concert with Maczek's [[1st Polish Armoured Division]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=241}}

On 1 August 1944, 2e DB landed at [[Utah Beach]] in Normandy as part of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Wade Haislip]]'s [[XV Corps (United States)|United States XV Corps]] of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton, Jr.]]'s [[United States Third Army]].{{sfn|Clayton|1992|pp=55–56}} Both of these American generals spoke French fluently.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=232, 257}} Later that month, 2e DB participated in the [[Falaise Pocket|Battle of the Falaise Pocket]], which inflicted a major defeat on the German Army.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|pp=55–56}}  Like most new division commanders, Leclerc also made errors, in his case by allowing 2e DB to use roads that had been earmarked for American units, thereby causing traffic jams and holding up the American advance.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=267–268}}

The next assignment for 2e DB, and the one that it had been brought from Africa for, was the [[liberation of Paris]]. Allied troops initially avoided the historic city, moving around it to minimise the danger of destruction if the Germans sought to defend it. When Parisians rose against the Germans, de Gaulle and Leclerc persuaded [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to help.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=288–291}} Leclerc's men had to fight their way into Paris, and when they got there they found German infantry and tanks still holding parts of the city.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=302–308}} The German commander, ''[[General of the Infantry (Germany)|General der Infanterie]]'' [[Dietrich von Choltitz]], was inclined to surrender, and did so to Leclerc and [[Henri Rol-Tanguy]] of the [[French Forces of the Interior]] at the [[Gare Montparnasse]] on 25 August 1944. Leclerc arranged for [[Ensign]] [[Philippe de Gaulle]], who was serving in the RBFM, to be in attendance, but the elder de Gaulle was annoyed that Leclerc had allowed the communist Rol to co-sign the surrender.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=310–311}} The next day de Gaulle held a triumphal parade, accompanied by senior military figures including Leclerc, [[Alphonse Juin]], [[Pierre Koenig]] and Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=316}}

[[File:Crowds of French patriots line the Champs Elysees-edit2.jpg|thumb|right|Crowds of French patriots line the Champs Elysees to view Free French tanks and half tracks of Leclerc's 2e DB pass through the ''[[Arc du Triomphe]]'' on 26 August 1944, after Paris was liberated.|alt=Crowds line the Champs Elysees as tanks and half tracks roll down it.

Montgomery's troops liberated Tailly, allowing Leclerc to return home to see Thérèse and the children again on 6 September 1944. His oldest sons, Henri and Hubert, now 18 and 17 years old respectively, lied about their ages to volunteer for service with 2e DB. Henri went on to serve with the RMT, while Hubert became a [[Sherman tank]] gunner with the 12e RCA. Other relatives also served with the division, including two nephews. The fighting in Paris cost 2e DB 97 killed and 238 wounded; nearly twice that number were lost in the fighting in surrounding areas. These were replaced by men and women who, like Leclerc's sons, offered themselves at a recruitment office the 2e DB established near the [[Bois de Boulogne]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=320–322}}

After Paris, 2e DB returned to XV Corps at Leclerc's request.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=324}} He won a notable victory on 12–16 September 1944 against the [[Panzer IV]]s and [[Panther tank]]s of the German 112th ''Panzer'' Brigade by using manoeuvre and air power to compensate for the numerical and technical inferiority of his tanks. American historian [[Hugh M. Cole]] wrote that &quot;this fight, characterised warmly by the XV Corps commander as a 'brilliant example' of perfect air-ground co-ordination, not only was an outstanding feat of arms but also dealt a crippling blow to Hitler's plans for an armoured thrust into the Third Army flank.&quot;{{sfn|Cole|1950|p=201}}

Patton personally pinned a [[Silver Star]] on Leclerc, and brought with him another six Silver Stars and 25 [[Bronze Star Medal]]s for other members of the 2e DB. Patton then gave Leclerc his next objective: the town of [[Baccarat]] and the bridge there over the [[Meurthe (river)|Meurthe River]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=334}} The bridge was captured before the Germans could destroy it.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|pp=58–61}} Haislip's XV Corps was transferred to the [[Seventh United States Army]] on 29 September,{{sfn|Clarke|Smith|1993|p=254}} and Leclerc feared that 2e DB would be transferred to ''Général d'armée'' [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]]'s [[French First Army]]. Leclerc regarded the First Army as being full of traitors who had supported Vichy France. Moreover, de Lattre had sacked ''Général de division'' [[Edgard de Larminat]] for [[Gaullist]] sentiments, and de Lattre had good reason to fear that he might meet a similar fate.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=324}}

On 22 November, Haislip gave Leclerc permission to advance on Strasbourg. Leclerc surprised the Germans by advancing over country roads and tracks to bypass their defences. Strasbourg was reached on 25 November,{{sfn|Clarke|Smith|1993|pp=380–381}} and that afternoon the [[Flag of France|Tricolour]] flew over the Strasbourg Cathedral. The [[Battle of the Bulge|German offensive in the Ardennes]] in December and [[Operation Nordwind|in Alsace]] in January led Eisenhower to consider abandoning Strasbourg, but strong opposition to the idea from the French caused him to back down. As a result, the 2e DB was transferred to de Lattre's command to assist in the reduction of the [[Colmar Pocket]].{{sfn|Clayton|1992|pp=58–61}}

Leclerc objected to the use of his troops in the attack on [[Royan]] in April 1945. As a result, only part of 2e DB was employed.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=382–383}} The division rejoined Seventh Army, crossing the [[Rhine]] on 25 April, and joining the pursuit into [[Bavaria]]. Leclerc visited [[Dachau concentration camp]] after its liberation by the Americans.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=389–391}} In an incident that took place 8 May 1945 at [[Bad Reichenhall]] in Bavaria, he was presented with a defiant group of captured Frenchmen of the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|SS ''Charlemagne'' Division]]. He asked them why they wore a German uniform, to which one of them replied by asking why Leclerc wore an American one. Leclerc told his men to get rid of them. That was taken as a death sentence. The group of French [[Waffen-SS]] men was summarily executed by the RMT without any form of military tribunal procedure, and their bodies left where they fell until an American burial team collected them.{{sfn|Trigg|2006|p=161}}{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=399–400}} For his services leading the 2e DB, Leclerc was awarded the Grand Cross of the [[Legion of Honour]].{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=402}}

==South East Asia==
{{see also|French Indochina in World War II|First Indochina War}}
At the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of the Second World War in Europe]] in May 1945, Leclerc received command of the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] (''Corps expéditionnaire français en Extrême-Orient'', CEFEO). He represented France at the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|surrender of the Japanese Empire]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] on 2 September 1945. On 28 November 1945, he legally [[name change|changed his name]] to Jacques-Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, incorporating his Free French pseudonym.&lt;ref name=&quot;memorial&quot;/&gt;

Although he had never before served in the Far East, as CEFEO commander, Leclerc was charged with recovering [[French Indochina]]. This territory, comprising the present day states of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, had been conquered by the French during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Vichy regime had allowed the Japanese to use Indochina as a base from which to attack the Allies in Malaya, Burma and China. On 9 March 1945, the Japanese had deposed the French colonial government, taken direct control of Indochina, defeated the French army in several engagements, and imprisoned surviving French soldiers.{{sfn|Logevall|2012|pp=67–71}}

Other French representatives stand behind him while General [[Douglas MacArthur]], Supreme Allied Commander, stands at the microphone.|alt=A large crowd of men in uniforms. Leclerc sits at a small desk signing a document. MacArthur stands behind him.]]With the end of the war, Indochina was divided in two, with the area north of the 16th parallel occupied by 150,000 [[Nationalist Chinese]] troops, while the part to the south was occupied by 20,000 British and Indian troops of [[Major General (United Kingdom)|Major General]] [[Douglas Gracey]]'s [[20th Infantry Division (India)|20th Infantry Division]]. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese nationalist leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] had declared Vietnamese independence. Leclerc arrived in [[Saigon]] with a first contingent of French soldiers on 5 October 1945.  He was dependent on the British for equipment and shipping.{{sfn|Logevall|2012|pp=118–119}} He did not get along well with D'Argenlieu, whom de Gaulle had appointed French High Commissioner for Indochina.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=414–417}}

Leclerc heeded the advice he was given by United States [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] to bring as many soldiers as possible.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=412}} He broke the [[Vietminh]] blockade around [[Saigon]], then drive through the [[Mekong]] delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was getting rid of the Chinese, and for this he needed French help.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=424–426}} Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=695}}

The French government negotiator [[Jean Sainteny]] flew to Saigon to consult Leclerc, who was acting as high commissioner in the absence of d'Argenlieu. Leclerc approved Sainteny's proposal to negotiate with Ho because he preferred a diplomatic solution to a larger conflict, but he still dispatched a flotilla with shiploads of French soldiers to northern Vietnam ready to attack if the talks failed. At that time, Ho felt that negotiations with the French constituted his best option because the [[Soviet Union]] had not yet endorsed the Vietminh or the Vietnamese nationalist party ([[VNQDD]]), and the [[French Communist Party]] chose to support French rule in Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|pp=152–153}}

On 6 March 1946, a tentative agreement was reached at the last minute (with Leclerc's fleet already in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]) between Sainteny and Ho. The agreement stated that France would recognise Vietnam as a free state within the [[French Union]], a new name for the French empire broadly similar to the [[British Commonwealth]], and that Ho would allow France to base 25,000 soldiers in Vietnam for five years.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=153}} The [[Ho-Sainteny agreement]] was never confirmed because it disappointed people on both sides. Ho's immense prestige largely silenced Vietnamese dissent, but the agreement caused a serious split within the French side. French businessmen, planters, and officials in Saigon were &quot;indignant at the prospect of losing their colonial privileges.&quot;{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=154}}

D'Argenlieu bluntly denounced Leclerc. &quot;I am amazed – yes, that is the word, amazed&quot;, he said, &quot;that France's fine expeditionary corps in Indochina is commanded by officers who would rather negotiate than fight&quot;.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=153}} D'Argenlieu stated that a higher level meeting in Paris would be required. He then unilaterally declared a French-controlled Autonomous Republic of [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]] without asking either Paris or the Vietnamese.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|pp=152–153}} In 1946, Leclerc was replaced as commander of the French forces by [[Jean-Étienne Valluy]].{{sfn|Karnow|1983|pp=155, 696}} At the time many French and American politicians were willing to believe that Ho was part of a Soviet plan to dominate the world, but Leclerc warned that &quot;anti-communism will be a useless tool unless the problem of nationalism is resolved.&quot;{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=175}} His advice was simple: &quot;Negotiate at all costs!&quot;{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=449}}

Leclerc was appointed Inspector of Land Forces in North Africa. On 28 November 1947, his aircraft ''Tailly II'', carrying Leclerc and his staff, crashed near [[Béchar|Colomb-Béchar]] in [[French Algeria]], killing everyone on board. His body was returned to France, where it was taken to Paris along the route that 2e DB had followed in August 1944. A funeral service was held at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and he was interred in a crypt at ''[[Les Invalides]]''.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|pp=137–138}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.valeursactuelles.com/histoire/morts-myst%C3%A9rieuses-4.-leclerc-l%E2%80%99%C3%A9nigme-13e-passager20121026.html |title=Les morts mystérieuses : 4.
