'''Kowloon Walled City''' was a [[population density|densely populated]], largely [[anarchy|ungoverned settlement]] in [[Kowloon City]], [[Hong Kong]]. Originally a [[Qing Dynasty|Chinese]] military [[fort]], the Walled City became an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] after the [[New Territories]] were leased to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1898. Its population increased dramatically following the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]] during [[World War II]]. By 1987, the Walled City contained 33,000 residents within its {{convert|2.6|ha|acre|adj=on}} borders. From the 1950s to the 1970s, it was controlled by local [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]]s and had high rates of [[prostitution]], [[gambling]], and [[drug abuse]].

In January 1987, the [[government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]] announced plans to [[demolition|demolish]] the Walled City. After an arduous [[eviction]] process, demolition began in March 1993 and was completed in April 1994. [[Kowloon Walled City Park]] opened in December 1995 and occupies the area of the former Walled City. Some historical [[artifact (archaeology)|arte&lt;!-- NOTE!

==History==

===Military outpost===
[[Image:Kowloon-Walled-City-1898.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lung Tsun Stone Bridge]] and Lung Tsun Pavilion (Pavilion for Greeting Officials) of Kowloon Walled City in 1898|alt=The front entrance of a fort with mountains in the background.]]

The history of the Walled City can be traced back to the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), when an outpost was set up to manage the trade of [[salt]]. Little took place for hundreds of years afterward, although 30 guards were stationed there in 1668.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;/&gt; A small coastal fort was established around 1810.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinn&quot;/&gt; In 1842, during [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] [[Daoguang Emperor|Emperor Daoguang]]'s reign, [[Hong Kong Island]] was ceded to Britain by the [[Treaty of Nanking|Treaty of Nanjing]]. As a result, the Qing authorities felt it necessary to improve the fort in order to rule the area and check further British influence. The improvements, including the formidable [[defensive wall]], were completed in 1847. The Walled City was captured by rebels during the [[Taiping Rebellion]] in 1854 before being retaken a few weeks later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Li Long Lam]], [http://www.nssd.org/articles/article_detail.aspx?id=24822524 Excavation Report of Kowloon Walled City, Hong Kong](香港九龙寨城发掘简报)&quot;, in ''Kaogu'', vol. 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The present Walled City's &quot;Dapeng Association House&quot; forms the remnants of what was previously [[Lai Enjue]]'s garrison.

[[File:Victoria City and Kowloon 1915.jpg|thumb|left|1915 map of the Hong Kong region with the Kowloon Walled City listed as &quot;Chinese Town&quot; at the upper right-hand corner]]
The [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory]] of 1898 handed additional parts of Hong Kong (the [[New Territories]]) to Britain for 99 years, but excluded the Walled City, which at the time had a population of roughly 700. China was allowed to continue to keep officials there as long as they did not interfere with the defence of [[British Hong Kong]]. The following year, the Governor, Sir [[Henry Arthur Blake|Henry Blake]], suspected that the Viceroy of Canton was using troops to aid resistance to the new arrangements. On 16 May 1899, British forces attacked the Walled City, only to find the Viceroy's soldiers gone, leaving behind only the [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] and 150 residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;/&gt; The Qing dynasty ended its rule in 1912, leaving the Walled City to the British.

Though the British claimed ownership of the Walled City, they did little with it over the following few decades. The Protestant church established an [[Retirement home|old people's home]] in the old &quot;yamen&quot; (Chinese meaning administrative office), as well as a school and [[almshouse]] in other former offices. Aside from such institutions, however, the Walled City became a mere curiosity for British colonials and tourists to visit, it was labelled as &quot;Chinese Town&quot; in a 1915 map. In 1933, the Hong Kong authorities announced plans to demolish most of the decaying Walled City's buildings, compensating the 436 squatters that lived there with new homes. By 1940 only the yamen, the school, and one house remained. During its [[World War II]] [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|occupation of Hong Kong]], [[Japan]] demolished the City's wall and used the stone to expand the nearby [[Kai Tak Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;/&gt;

===Urban settlement===
After [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945, [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]] announced its intent to reclaim its rights to the Walled City. Refugees from mainland China because of the Chinese Civil War post 1945 poured in to take advantage of British protection (Walled City is a Chinese territory but surrounded by British lands), and 2,000 [[Squatting|squatters]] occupied the Walled City by 1947. After a failed attempt to drive them out in 1948, the British adopted a 'hands-off' policy in most matters concerning the Walled City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt;

In January 1950, a fire broke out that destroyed over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people.&lt;ref name = &quot;Smart2006&quot; /&gt; The disaster highlighted the need for proper [[fire prevention]] in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated by the lack of political ties with the colonial and Chinese governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smart2006_2&quot; /&gt; The ruins gave new arrivals to the Walled City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.&lt;ref name = &quot;Smart2006_2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth2006&quot; /&gt;

With no government enforcement from the Chinese or the British aside from a few raids by the [[Hong Kong Police]], the Walled City became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the Walled City that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By this time, however, the Walled City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as [[Triad (underground societies)|Triads]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt;

Beginning in the 1950s, Triad groups such as the [[14K Triad|14K]] and [[Sun Yee On]] gained a stranglehold on the Walled City's countless [[brothel]]s, [[Casino|gambling parlors]], and [[opium den]]s. The Walled City had become such a haven for criminals that police would venture into it only in large groups.&lt;ref name = scmp&gt;{{cite news|last=Carney|first=John|title=Kowloon Walled City: Life in the City of Darkness| url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1191748/kowloon-walled-city-life-city-darkness | accessdate = 29 January 2014 | newspaper = [[South China Morning Post]] | date = 16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until 1973–74, when a series of more than 3,500 police raids resulted in over 2,500 arrests and over {{convert |1800|kg}} of seized drugs, that the Triads' power began to wane. With public support, particularly from younger residents, the continued raids gradually eroded drug use and violent crime. In 1983, the police commander of [[Kowloon City District]] declared the Walled City's crime rate to be under control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:KowloonWalledCityAlley2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A rare patch of sunlight in an alley of the City|alt=A view of a dark alley angled up toward the sky, with a pinpoint of light at the top.]]
The City also underwent massive construction during the 1960s, with developers building new modular structures above older ones. The city became extremely densely populated, with over 30,000 people in 300 buildings occupying little more than {{convert|7|acre}}. As a result, the city reached its maximum size by the late 1970s and early 1980s; a height restriction of 13 to 14 storeys had been imposed on the city due to the flight path of planes heading towards [[Kai Tak Airport]].&lt;ref name = &quot;p48&quot; /&gt; As well as limiting building height, the proximity of the airport subjected residents to serious noise pollution for the last 20 years of the city's existence. Eight municipal pipes provided water to the entire structure (although more could have come from wells).&lt;ref name = &quot;Water&quot;/&gt; A few of the streets were illuminated by [[fluorescent light]]s, as sunlight rarely reached the lower levels due to the outstanding disregard to [[air rights]] within the city.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt; Although the rampant crime of earlier decades diminished in later years, the Walled City was still known for its high number of unlicensed doctors and [[dentist]]s, who could operate there without threat of prosecution.&lt;ref name = &quot;Vines&quot; /&gt;

Although the Walled City was for many years a hotbed of criminal activity, most residents were not involved in any crime and lived peacefully within its walls. Numerous small factories and businesses thrived inside the Walled City, and some residents formed groups to organise and improve daily life there.&lt;ref name= &quot;Basler&quot; /&gt; An attempt by the government in 1963 to demolish some shacks in a corner of the City gave rise to an &quot;antidemolition committee&quot; that served as the basis for a [[Kaifong association]]. Charities, religious societies, and other welfare groups were gradually introduced to the City. While medical clinics and schools went unregulated, the Hong Kong government did provide some services, such as water supply and mail delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt;

===Eviction and demolition===
Over time, both the British and the Chinese governments found the City to be increasingly intolerable, despite a reduction in the reported crime rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyMail&quot;/&gt; The quality of life in the City — sanitary conditions in particular — remained far behind the rest of Hong Kong. The [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] in 1984 laid the groundwork for the City's demolition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;/&gt; The mutual decision by the two governments to tear down the Walled City was announced on 14{{nbsp}}January 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goddard&quot;/&gt; On 10 March 1987, following the announcement that the Walled City would be converted to a park, the Secretary for District Administration formally requested the [[Urban Council]] agree to take over the site following demolition. Owing to the presence of numerous other green spaces in the area the [[Urban Services Department]] doubted the need for &quot;yet another park&quot; from a planning and operations point of view, but the council agreed nonetheless to accept the government's proposal on the condition that the government bear the cost of park construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum for Members of the Recreation Select Committee, Capital Works Select Committee, Finance Select Committee, and the Standing Committee of the Whole Council: Proposed Park at the site of Kowloon Walled City|publisher=Urban Council|date=10 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum for Members of the Recreation Select Committee: Proposed Park Development at The Kowloon Walled City Site|publisher=Urban Council|date=7 September 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government distributed some {{HKD|2.7 billion}} ({{USD|350 million}}) in compensation to the estimated 33,000 residents and businesses in a plan devised by a special committee of the [[Hong Kong Housing Authority]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lau&quot; /&gt; Some residents were not satisfied with the compensation, and were forcibly evicted between November 1991 and July 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Families&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot;/&gt; After four months of planning,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chung&quot;/&gt; demolition of the Walled City began on 23{{nbsp}}March 1993&lt;ref name=&quot;Vines&quot;/&gt; and concluded in April 1994. Construction work on Kowloon Walled City Park started the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

The park's design is modelled on [[Jiangnan]] [[Chinese garden|gardens]] of the early [[Qing Dynasty]]. It is divided into eight landscape features,&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; with the fully restored [[yamen]] as its centrepiece.

[[Image:Image-Kowloon Walled City southgate.jpg|right|thumb|Remnants of the City's South Gate and its entrance plaques|alt=On a green lawn surrounded by a brick wall lie broken engraved stones and stone foundations.]]

Components of the park include:
* The Eight Floral Walks, each named after a different plant or flower&lt;ref name=&quot;Walks&quot;/&gt;
* The Chess Garden, featuring four {{convert|3|by|5|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Chinese chess]]boards&lt;ref name=&quot;Chess&quot;/&gt;
* The Garden of [[Chinese zodiac]], containing stone statues of the 12 [[Chinese zodiac]] animals&lt;ref name=&quot;Zodiac&quot;/&gt;
* The Garden of Four Seasons (named Guangyin Square after the small open area in the Walled City), a {{convert|300|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} garden with plants that symbolise the four seasons&lt;ref name=&quot;Seasons&quot;/&gt;
* The Six Arts Terrace, a {{convert|600|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} wedding area containing a garden and the Bamboo Pavilion&lt;ref name=&quot;Film&quot;/&gt;
* The Kuixing Pavilion, including a [[moon gate]] framed by two stone tablets and the towering Guibi Rock, which represents Hong Kong's return to China&lt;ref name=&quot;Guibi&quot;/&gt;
* The Mountain View Pavilion, a two-storey structure resembling a docked boat that provides a good view of the entire park&lt;ref name=&quot;Film&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mountain&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Kowloon Walled City2.jpg|thumb|right|Children of early 20th century Kowloon Walled City residents playing on the yamen cannons]]
The [[Antiquities and Monuments Office]] conducted archaeological examinations as the Walled City was being demolished, and several cultural remains were discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIS&quot;/&gt; Among them were the Walled City's yamen and remnants of its South Gate, which were officially designated [[declared monuments of Hong Kong]] on 4 October 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monuments&quot;/&gt;

The South Gate had originally served as the Walled City's main entrance. Along with its foundation, other remains included two stone plaques inscribed with &quot;South Gate&quot; and &quot;Kowloon Walled City&quot; from the South Gate and a flagstone path that had led up to it. The foundations of the City's wall and East Gate were also discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; The Hong Kong government preserved the South Gate remnants next to a square in front of the yamen.&lt;ref name=&quot;GatePark&quot;/&gt;

The yamen building is made up of three halls. Originally the middle hall served the Assistant Magistrate of Kowloon's administrative office, and the rear block was his residence. After the government officials left the area in 1899, it was used for several other purposes, including an old people's home, a refuge for widows and orphans, a school, and a clinic. It was restored in 1996 and is now found near the centre of the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yamen&quot;/&gt; It contains a photo gallery of the Walled City, and two [[cannon]] dating back to 1802 sit at the sides of its entrance.&lt;ref name=&quot;YamenPark&quot;/&gt;

==Layout and architecture==

|label=&lt;small&gt;Kowloon Walled City&lt;/small&gt;
|position=right
|caption=&lt;small&gt;The City's former location within Hong Kong&lt;/small&gt;}}
The Walled City was located in what became known as the [[Kowloon City]] [[List of places in Hong Kong|area]] of Kowloon. In spite of its transformation from a fort into an urban enclave, the Walled City retained the same basic layout. The original fort was built on a slope&lt;ref name=&quot;p18&quot;/&gt; and consisted of a {{convert|2.6|ha|sqmi|adj=on}} plot measuring about {{convert|210|by|120|m|ft}}. The stone wall surrounding it had four entrances and measured {{convert|4|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|4.6|m|ft}} thick before it was dismantled in 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benedetti&quot;/&gt;

Construction surged dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s, until the formerly [[low-rise]] City consisted almost entirely of buildings with 10 storeys or more (with the notable exception of the yamen in its centre).&lt;ref name=&quot;p48&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goddard&quot;/&gt; However, due to the Kai Tak Airport's position {{convert|800|m|mi}} south of the City, buildings did not exceed 14 storeys.&lt;ref name=&quot;p206&quot;/&gt; The two-storey Sai Tau Tsuen settlement bordered the Walled City to the south and west until it was cleared in 1985 and replaced with [[Carpenter Road Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Girard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p71&quot;/&gt;

The City's dozens of [[alley]]ways were often only {{convert|1|–|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and had poor lighting and drainage.&lt;ref name=&quot;W-S&quot;/&gt; An informal network of [[staircase]]s and passageways also formed on upper levels, which was so extensive that one could travel north to south through the entire City without ever touching solid ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;p48&quot;/&gt; Construction in the City went unregulated, and most of the roughly 350 buildings were built with poor [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]] and few or no [[public utility|utilities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p48,74,79&quot;/&gt; Because apartments were so small — a typical unit was {{convert|23|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} — space was maximised with wider upper floors, caged balconies, and rooftop additions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goddard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p34,199&quot;/&gt; [[Roof]]s in the City were full of television antennae, [[clothes line]]s, water tanks, and rubbish, and could be crossed using a series of ladders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popham&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p199,203&quot;/&gt;

==Population==
Kowloon Walled City's early population fluctuated between zero and a few hundred, and began growing steadily shortly after World War II. However, there is no accurate population information available for much of the Walled City's later existence. Official [[census]] numbers estimated the Walled City's population at 10,004 in 1971 and 14,617 in 1981, but these figures were commonly considered to be much too low. Informal estimates, on the other hand, often mistakenly included the neighbouring [[squatter village]] of Sai Tau Tsuen.&lt;ref name=&quot;W-S&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Siu-Fong&quot;/&gt; Population figures of about 50,000 were also reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyMail&quot;/&gt;

A thorough government survey in 1987 gave a clearer picture: an estimated 33,000 people resided within the Walled City. Based on this survey, the Walled City had a population density of approximately {{convert|1,255,000|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}} in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goddard&quot;/&gt;

Contrary to what many outsiders believed, most residents of the Walled City behaved similarly to other [[Hong Kong people|Hong Kong]] natives.&lt;ref name=&quot;p90&quot;/&gt; In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships.&lt;ref name=&quot;p122&quot;/&gt; Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households.&lt;ref name=&quot;p115,154&quot;/&gt; The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents used them to relax, and children would play or do homework there after school.&lt;ref name=&quot;p203–04&quot;/&gt;

The yamen in the heart of the City was also a major social centre, a place for residents to talk, have tea or watch television, and to take classes such as calligraphy. The Old People's Centre also held religious meetings for Christians and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;p132&quot;/&gt; Other religious institutions included the Fuk Tak and [[Tin Hau temples in Hong Kong|Tin Hau]] temples, which were used for a combination of [[Buddhist]], [[Taoist]], and [[animist]] practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;p26,139&quot;/&gt;

{{Quote box |width=30em |align=right  |salign=right
|quote = The Walled City of Kowloon has no visible wall around it, but it is as clearly defined as if there were one made of hard, high steel. It is instantly sensed by the congested open market that runs along the street in front of the row of dark run-down flats—shacks haphazardly perched on top of one another giving the impression that at any moment the entire blighted complex will collapse under its own weight, leaving nothing but rubble where elevated rubble had stood.

A few people who spent time in Kowloon Walled City have written accounts of their experiences. Evangelist [[Jackie Pullinger]] wrote a 1989 memoir, ''Crack in the Wall'', about her involvement in treating drug addicts within the Walled City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pullinger&quot;/&gt; In his 2004 autobiography ''Gweilo'', [[Martin Booth]] describes his exploration of the Walled City as a child in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDonogh&quot;/&gt;

In addition to such accounts, many authors, game designers, and filmmakers have used the Walled City to convey a sense of oppressive urbanisation or unfettered criminality. In literature, [[Robert Ludlum]]'s novel ''[[The Bourne Supremacy]]'' uses the Walled City as one of its settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourne&quot;/&gt; {{anchor|gibson}}The City appears as a virtual reality environment (described by [[Steven Poole]] as an &quot;oasis of political and creative freedom&quot;) in [[William Gibson]]'s [[Bridge trilogy]], and as a contrast with [[Singapore]] in his ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' article &quot;[[Disneyland with the Death Penalty]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired&quot;/&gt; In the [[manga]] ''[[Crying Freeman]]'', the titular character's wife travels to the Walled City to master her swordsmanship and control a cursed sword.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartholow&quot;/&gt; The manga ''[[List of Blood+ chapters#Blood+: Kowloon Nights|Blood+: Kowloon Nights]]'' uses the Walled City as the setting for a series of murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blood&quot;/&gt; The Walled City plays a heavy role in the roleplaying video game [[Shadowrun: Hong Kong]], in which the Walled City has been rebuilt in the future.

The 1982 [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]] film ''[[Brothers from the Walled City]]'' is set in Kowloon Walled City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sogoodreviews.com/reviews/brothersfromthewalledcity.htm |title=Review of '&amp;#39;Brothers from the Walled City'&amp;#39; |publisher=Sogoodreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1984 gangster film ''[[Long Arm of the Law (film)|Long Arm of the Law]]'' features the Walled City as a refuge for gang members before they are gunned down by police.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDonogh&quot;/&gt; In the 1988 film ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]'', starring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], the Walled City is the setting for a martial arts tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Age&quot;/&gt; The 1992 non-narrative film ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' features several highly detailed shots of the Walled City shortly before its demolition. The 1993 film ''[[Crime Story (film)|Crime Story]]'' starring [[Jackie Chan]] was partly filmed in the deserted Walled City, and includes real scenes of building explosions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strother&quot;/&gt; A walled neighbourhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]'' was inspired by the Walled City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Otto&quot;/&gt; The 2006 Hong Kong horror film ''[[Re-cycle]]'' features a decrepit, nightmarish version of the Walled City, complete with tortured souls from which the protagonist must flee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shingleton&quot;/&gt; The 2016 TVB martial arts drama ''[[A Fist Within Four Walls]]'' takes place in the [[Triad (organized crime)|triad-ridden]] Walled City in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TVB 周刊 #950 新劇解構&quot; [TVB Weekly, #950; New drama explained].

Kowloon Walled City is depicted in several games, including ''[[Kowloon's Gate]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;McDonogh&quot;/&gt; ''[[Shenmue II]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;McMillan&quot;/&gt; and ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]''. The game ''[[Stranglehold (video game)|Stranglehold]]'', a sequel to the film ''[[Hard Boiled]]'', features a version of the Walled City filled with hundreds of Triad members.&lt;ref name=&quot;McMillan&quot;/&gt; In the games ''[[Fear Effect]]'' and ''[[Fear Effect 2]]'', photographs of the Walled City were used as inspiration &quot;for moods, camera angles and lighting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lui&quot;/&gt; Concept art for the [[MMORPG]] ''[[Guild Wars: Factions]]'' depicts massive, densely packed structures inspired by the Walled City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guild&quot;/&gt; The pen-and-paper [[Role-playing game|RPG]] ''[[Shadowrun]]'' includes a crime-ridden, rebuilt version of the Walled City set in 2056.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shadowrun&quot;/&gt;

A partial recreation of the Kowloon Walled City exists in the Kawasaki Warehouse, an [[amusement arcade]] that opened in 2009 in the Japanese suburb of [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa]]. The designer's desire to accurately replicate the atmosphere of the Walled City is reflected in the arcade's narrow corridors, electrical wires, pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches that provide an air of authenticity.&lt;ref name=&quot;scmp-kawasaki&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Ryall |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1321559/arcade-brings-kowloon-walled-city-back-dead-japan |title=Arcade brings Kowloon Walled City back from the dead … in Japan|work=South China Morning Post|date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
