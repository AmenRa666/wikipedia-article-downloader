'''HMS ''Blanche'' (H47)''' was a {{Sclass2-|B|destroyer}} built for the [[Royal Navy]] around 1930. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–1939, the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]] measures agreed by Britain and France. She was attacked, but not damaged, by [[Francoist Spain|Nationalist]] [[bomber]]s in early 1938 and was subsequently transferred to the [[Home Fleet]]. ''Blanche'' was sunk by a [[naval mine|mine]] in November 1939, becoming the first British destroyer lost to enemy action in [[World War II]].

==Description==
''Blanche'' displaced {{convert|1360|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1790|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|323|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|32|ft|3|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|3|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|34000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s. ''Blanche'' carried a maximum of {{convert|390|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|4800|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}.&lt;ref name=w78&gt;Whitley, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's complement was 134 officers and men, although it increased to 142 during wartime.&lt;ref name=f8&gt;Friedman, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship mounted four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|QF 4.7-inch Mk IX guns]] in single mounts. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Blanche'' had two {{convert|40|mm|1|adj=on}} [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk II]] AA guns mounted on a platform between her [[funnel (ship)|funnels]]. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.&lt;ref name=f8/&gt; One [[depth charge]] rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The ship was ordered on 4 March 1929 from [[Hawthorn Leslie and Company|Hawthorn Leslie]] of [[Hebburn]], under the 1928 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 29 July 1929, and launched on 29 May 1930,&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; as the tenth RN ship to carry this name.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blanche'' was completed on 14 February 1931 at a cost of £225,195, excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns, ammunition and communications equipment.&lt;ref&gt;March, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; After her commissioning, she was assigned to the [[4th Destroyer Flotilla]] with the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] until 1936. The ship was refitted that year and reassigned, with her flotilla, to Home Fleet, after its completion. ''Blanche'' spent six months deployed off the southern Spanish coast during the Spanish Civil War, based in [[Gibraltar]]. She was attacked by five [[Francoist Spain|Nationalist]] [[bomber]]s on 6 March 1938, but they all missed.&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; The ship received a brief overhaul at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] between 1 April and 11 June 1938 and was then assigned to the anti-submarine flotilla based at the [[Isle of Portland]]. During the [[Munich Crisis]], ''Blanche'' was one of the destroyers that escorted the [[ocean liner]] {{RMS|Aquitania}} and the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Revenge|06|6}} in the English Channel on 30 September. She was given a more thorough refit in [[Sheerness Dockyard]] between 1 April and 15 July 1939 and became the emergency destroyer at the [[Nore]] upon its completion.&lt;ref name=e4&gt;English, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blanche'' was assigned to the [[19th Destroyer Flotilla]] when World War II began and spent the next two months escorting convoys and patrolling in the Channel and [[North Sea]]. The ship and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{HMS|Basilisk|H11|2}} were escorting the [[minelayer]] {{HMS|Adventure|M23|2}} on the morning of 13 November in the [[Thames Estuary]] when they entered a minefield laid the night before by several German destroyers. ''Adventure'' and ''Blanche'' both struck mines; the latter lost all power and capsized at 0950. One man was killed and twelve more were wounded. She was the first British destroyer sunk by the Germans during the war.&lt;ref name=e4/&gt;
