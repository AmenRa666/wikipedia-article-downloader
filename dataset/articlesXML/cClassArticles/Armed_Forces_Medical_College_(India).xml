The '''Armed Forces Medical College''' (AFMC) is a medical college in [[Pune]], [[India]], in the state of [[Maharashtra]]. The college is managed by the [[Indian Armed Forces]].

Established in May 1948 after [[World War II]] on the recommendation of the [[Bidhan Chandra Roy|BC Roy]] Committee, remnants of various [[Indian Army Medical Corps]] units were amalgamated to create the Armed Forces Medical services. The AFMC undergraduate wing was established on 4 August 1962, which is celebrated annually as AFMC Day by its alumni across the globe.

AFMC has been ranked consistently among the top medical colleges of India, with the Outlook 2012 and 2015 survey ranking it second amongst all the undergraduate medical institutions of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;outlookindia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281300|title=Top Medical &amp; Dental Colleges  - Outlook, MDRA - Jun 25,2012|work=outlookindia.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
