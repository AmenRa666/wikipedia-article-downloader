The '''Shumen fortress''' ({{lang-bg|Шуменска крепост}}, ''Shumenska krepost'') is an archaeological site overlooking the city of [[Shumen]] in north-eastern [[Bulgaria]].

It is an ancient fortress with historical links to a village nearby traced to early [[Iron Age]] and later owned by the [[Thracians]] in the 5th century BC. Then, from 2nd to 4th centuries AD, it was controlled by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] who built towers and walls, and it was refurbished by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] as their [[garrison]] town. Shumen thrived in the Middle Ages as an important stronghold of the [[Bulgarian Empire]]. In 1444 the fort was destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] after their victory in the [[Battle of Varna]] over a Christian army under [[Władysław III of Poland]]. The fortress remained deserted ever since.
 
Restoration works on the fortress commenced in 2012 under the project titled “Bulgaria Begins Here”, and was completed partially in 2015 with financial assistance provided under the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) and Norway Grants to the Shumen Municipality and the Shumen Regional Museum of History.

==Location==
The fortress is built over a hill which gives a commanding view of the [[Shumen]] city. It is located at a distance of {{Convert|5.5| km}} from the [[Shumen]] city's [[Tombul Mosque]].{{Sfn|Baker|Deliso|2013|p=773}} It is located within the [[Shumen Plateau Nature Park]].&lt;ref name=Symbol&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://eeagrants.org/News/2012/Restoring-Shumen-Fortress |title= Restoring Shumen Fortress - EEA Grants|date=1 August 2010|accessdate=27 April 2016|publisher= EEA Grants - Norway Grants, Financial Mechanism Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the entrance of the fortress, about {{Convert|3| km}} away is the &quot;Creators of the Bulgarian State&quot; Monument erected in 1981 during the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|communist regime]] to commemorate the 1300th anniversary of the Bulgarian state. An information center is {{Convert|300| m}} away from this monument and a {{Convert|3| km}} track from here leads to the fortress.{{Sfn|Baker|Deliso|2013|p=773}}{{Sfn|Watkins|Deliso|2008|p=165}}

==History==
The fortress represents a substantial part of the history of Bulgaria. The Ancient [[Bulgars]], semi-nomadic warrior tribes of [[Turkey|Turkic]] extraction, arrived in what is in now north-eastern Bulgaria to the south of the [[Danube]] in the late 7th century AD and founded the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].&lt;ref name=Fund&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2016/01/12/bulgarias-shumen-completes-restoration-of-ancient-and-medieval-shumen-fortress-with-norway-funding/|title=Bulgaria’s Shumen Completes Restoration of Ancient and Medieval Shumen Fortress with Norway Funding|date=12 January 2016 |accessdate=27 April 2016|publisher= Archaeologyinbulgaria.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress formed the town of Shumen during the First and [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. During archaeological excavations, carried out since 1957, a village dating back to the Iron Age (around 4th century BC) of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|First Empire]] was revealed. [[Thracians]] ruled over the territory from 5th to 2nd century BC, which was followed by [[Roman Empire|Romans]] who ruled from first century BC to 3rd century AD, and then by the early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] from 4th to 6th century AD.&lt;ref name=Symbol/&gt;{{Sfn|Kassabova|2008|p=91}}{{Sfn|Cheynet|Sode|2006|p=94}} 

During the First Bulgarian Empire the fortress was part of a system of fortifications providing for the defense of [[Pliska]] and [[Preslav]], capital cities, and the religious centre of [[Madara (village)|Madara]]. It then functioned as a minor fort during the 10th–12th centuries, as compared to the glory, economic prosperity and military might it had during the 4th–6th centuries. In the 13th century it again prospered as a political and economic entity of the reborn Bulgarian Empire. When the Byzantines temporarily took control of [[Veliki Preslav|Preslav]] in 1278 during the [[Uprising of Ivaylo]] Shumen also acquired importance as an administrative and military centre. The fortress continued to thrive in the 14th century until the [[Ottoman Turks]] captured it in 1388 during a [[Bulgarian–Ottoman wars|campaign]] of their first vizier [[Çandarlı Ali Pasha]].{{Sfn|Cheynet|Sode|2006|p=94}}{{Sfn|Fine|1987|p=407}} 

In 1444 King [[Władysław III of Poland]] (Varnenchik) (r. 1440–1444) of Polish-Hungarian descent attempted to drive the Ottomans out of Europe at the head of a large Christian army but was defeated and killed in the [[Battle of Varna]].{{Sfn|Kassabova|2008|p=89}} Following this battle the fortress was looted and gutted, and the Ottoman rulers eventually abandoned it completely.{{Sfn|Cheynet|Sode|2006|p=95}}

==Description==
[[File:The fortress of Shumen 2.jpg|right|thumb|Restored features of the fortress.]]
The fortress was the best developed citadel during the 14th century. Archaeological excavations have been carried out since 1957 and many artefacts and structures have been unearthed. The ruined fort was partially restored during the period 2012–2015. At the foot of the fortress, monasteries and churches were found; some of which were reconstructed in the 1980s. The restoration works completed in 2015 covered walls of the fortress, creating tracks for walking around the fortress, and also building [[turnstiles]]. Other infrastructure created to encourage tourism are artistic lighting and equipment for temperature and humidity control, publicity brochures and overall management aspects.&lt;ref name=Symbol/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fund/&gt;

Coins and seals from the site were studied. A particular circular seal cast in bronze with two headed eagle at the top has been identified as belonging to [[tsar]] [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|John Alexander]] (r. 1331–1371). The image on the seal is stated to be a common feature of the 14th century seals, which were also made of gold and silver.{{Sfn|Cheynet|Sode|2006|p=94}}

Another feature noted in the fortress was of a limestone projection which was carved on one side with a &quot;double-headed eagle and a three-pointed crown seen between the heads of the birds.&quot; It was inferred that this marking was either made on the occasion of the visit of the ruler of Bulgaria to the fortress or may be a representation of the last emperor who ruled from [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]], [[Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria|Ivan Shishman]] (r. 1371–1395). In the 1970 excavations to the south of Shumen fortress, archaeologist [[Karel Škorpil]] unearthed the remnants of a church of {{Convert|7.3|x|4.5| m}} size.{{Sfn|Cheynet|Sode|2006|pp=89–94}} An inscription found on the wall of the fortress, dated to 13th century, relates to frequent terror attacks by [[Mongols]].{{Sfn|Petkov|2008|p=427}}

==Restoration==
The restoration of the fortress was initiated in 2012 under the project titled “Bulgaria Begins Here”. The works were completed partially in 2015 with financial assistance provided under the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) and Norway Grants to the Shumen Municipality and the Shumen Regional Museum of History.&lt;ref name=Fund/&gt;&lt;ref name=Symbol/&gt;
