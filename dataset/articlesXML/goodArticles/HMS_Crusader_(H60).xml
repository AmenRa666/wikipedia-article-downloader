'''HMS ''Crusader''''' was a [[C and D-class destroyer|C-class]] [[destroyer]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the early 1930s. She saw service in the [[Home Fleet|Home]] and [[Mediterranean Fleet]]s and spent six months during the [[Spanish Civil War]] in late 1936 in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. ''Crusader'' was sold to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) in 1938 and renamed HMCS ''Ottawa''. She was initially deployed on the Canadian [[Pacific Coast]] before [[World War II]], but was transferred to the [[Atlantic]] three months after the war began. She served as a convoy escort during the [[battle of the Atlantic]] until sunk by the {{Ship|German submarine|U-91|1941|6}} on 14 September 1942. Together with a British destroyer, she sank an Italian submarine in the North Atlantic in November 1941.

==Design and construction==
''Crusader'' displaced {{convert|1375|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1865|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|329|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|36000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|36|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Crusader'' carried a maximum of {{convert|473|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|5500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}. The ship's complement was 145 officers and men.&lt;ref name=w78&gt;Whitley, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship mounted four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch Mk IX guns]] in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Crusader'' had a single [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt|QF 3-inch 20 cwt]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;cwt&quot; is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 30 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.&lt;/ref&gt; AA gun between her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s, and two {{convert|40|mm|adj=on|1}} [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk II]] AA guns mounted on the aft end of her [[forecastle]] deck. The {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} AA gun was removed in 1936 and the 2-pounders were relocated to between the funnels. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|21-inch torpedoes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenton, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Three depth-charge chutes were fitted, each with a capacity of two [[depth charge]]s. After World War II began this was increased to 33 depth charges, delivered by one or two rails and two throwers.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 209, 236, 298–99&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was ordered on 15 July 1930 from [[Portsmouth Dockyard]] under the 1929 Naval Programme. ''Crusader'' was [[Keel|laid down]] on 12 September 1930, launched on 30 September 1931,&lt;ref name=e45&gt;English, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; as the second ship to carry the name,&lt;ref&gt;Colledge, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; and completed on 2 May 1932.&lt;ref name=e45/&gt;

==Service history==
''Crusader'' was initially assigned to the [[2nd Destroyer Flotilla]] of Home Fleet and remained with this flotilla for the next four years. She received her first refit at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] from 30 July to 4 September 1934. Following the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Abyssinia]] in August 1935, ''Crusader'' was sent with the rest of her flotilla to reinforce the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] the following month. From October to March 1936 she was deployed in the [[Red Sea]] to monitor Italian warship movements. Upon her return in April, the ship was refitted at Portsmouth from 27 April to 30 May. During the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in August–September 1936, the ship evacuated British nationals from Spanish ports on the [[Bay of Biscay]]. Crusader was assigned as the [[plane guard]] for the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} from January 1937 to March 1938, aside from a brief refit between 30 March and 27 April 1937. The ship began a major refit at [[Sheerness]] on 28 April 1938&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; to bring her up to Canadian specifications that included the installation of [[List of British Asdic systems|Type 124]] [[ASDIC]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy===
The ship was purchased for [[C$]]817,500 by the Royal Canadian Navy and she was commissioned on 15 June as HMCS ''Ottawa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gc.ca/project_pride/ships/ship_e.asp?shipNumber=4|title=Ship Technical Information|publisher=Canadian Navy Heritage Project|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was assigned to the Canadian Pacific Coast and arrived at [[CFB Esquimalt|Esquimalt]] on 7 November 1938.&lt;ref name=e9&gt;English, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; She remained there until she was ordered to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], Nova Scotia on 15 November 1939 where she escorted local convoys, including the convoy carrying half of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to the UK on 10 December.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ottawa''{{'}}s stern was damaged in a collision with the [[tugboat]] ''Bansurf'' in April 1940, and repairs took two months to complete.&lt;ref name=e9/&gt;

On 27 August 1940, ''Ottawa'' was sailed to [[Greenock]], [[Scotland]], and assigned to the 10th Escort Group&lt;ref name=e9/&gt; of the [[Western Approaches Command]] upon her arrival on 4 September for convoy escort duties.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; In October, the ship's rear torpedo tube mount was exchanged for a 12-pounder AA gun.&lt;ref name=e9/&gt; On 24–26 September, she rescued survivors of two British merchant ships; 55 from {{SS|Sulairia}} that had been sunk by {{Ship|German submarine|U-43|1939|2|up=yes}} and 60 from  {{SS|Eurymedon}} that had been sunk by {{Ship|German submarine|U-29|1936|2}}. ''Ottawa'' assisted the British destroyer {{HMS|Harvester|H19|2}} in sinking the {{ship|Italian submarine|Comandante Faà di Bruno}} on 7 November. By mid-November, ''Ottawa'' had been fitted with a [[Type 286 radar|Type 286M]] short-range surface-search [[radar]], adapted from the [[Royal Air Force]]'s ASV radar. This early model, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship. On 23 November, she rescued 29 survivors of the grain carrier {{SS|Bussum}} which had been sunk by {{Ship|German submarine|U-100|1940|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 110–11, 114–15, 118, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMCS Ottawa IKMD-03896.jpg|thumb|left|HMCS ''Ottawa'' with a 12-pounder AA gun in lieu of her rear torpedo tubes and 'Y' gun removed]]
''Ottawa'' returned to Canada in June 1941 and was assigned to the RCN's [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] Escort Force which covered convoys in the Mid-Atlantic. She was transferred to Escort Group C4 in May 1942.&lt;ref name=e9/&gt; In early September, the ship's captain refused to allow her [[List of British ordnance terms#DCT|director-control tower]] and [[rangefinder]] to be removed in exchange for a [[Type 271 radar|Type 271]] target indication [[radar]]. On 14 September, while escorting [[Convoy ON 127]] {{convert|500|nmi|km|-1}} east of [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], ''Ottawa'' was torpedoed by ''U-91''. Ten minutes later, unable to manoeuvre, she was hit by a second torpedo. She sank ten minutes later; 114 crewmen lost their lives, including the commanding officer, while nearby vessels rescued 69 survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 515, 522, 524&lt;/ref&gt;

The armament changes undergone by the ship during the war are not entirely clear. Photographic evidence shows that four [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns]] were added, one pair to her [[searchlight]] platform and the other pair on the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] wings, although ''Ottawa'' retained her 2-pounder guns even after the Oerlikons were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gc.ca/project_pride/includes/downloadAll_e.asp?file=/project_pride/all_zip_files/0HMCS%20OTTAWA.zip|title=High resolution pictures of HMCS Ottawa|publisher=Canadian Navy Heritage Project|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;
