{{nihongo|'''''Kumano'''''|熊野}} was one of four {{sclass-|Mogami|cruiser|4}} of [[heavy cruiser]]s in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], serving in [[World War II]]. She was named after the [[Kumano River]] [[Kii Peninsula]] on the island of [[Honshu]] in central [[Japan]].  The ''Mogami''-class ships were constructed as &quot;[[light cruiser]]s&quot; (per the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]) with five triple 6.1-inch [[dual purpose gun]]s.  They were exceptionally large for light cruisers, and the [[barbette]]s for the main battery were designed for quick refitting with twin 8-inch guns. In 1937 all four ships were &quot;converted&quot; to heavy cruisers in this fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitley&quot;&gt;Whitley, ''Cruisers of World War Two'', pp. 181-184&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Kumano'' served in numerous combat engagements in the [[Pacific War]], until she was eventually sunk by carrier aircraft from Task Force 38 while she was undergoing repairs at Santa Cruz, Philippines in November, 1944.

==Background and design==
Built under the [[1st Naval Armaments Supplement Programme|Maru-1 Naval Armaments Supplement Programme]], the ''Mogami''-class cruisers were designed to the maximum limits allowed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], using the latest technology. This resulted in the choice of the [[dual purpose gun|dual purpose]] (DP) [[15.5 cm/60 3rd Year Type naval gun]]s as the [[main battery]] in five triple [[Gun turret|turret]]s capable of 55° elevation. These were the first Japanese cruisers with triple turrets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;&gt;Patton, ''Japanese Heavy Cruisers of World War Two'', pp. 47-52&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary armament included eight [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun]]s in four twin turrets, and 24 [[Type 93 torpedo|Type 93 Long Lance]] torpedoes in four rotating quadruple mounts.

To save weight, electric welding was used, as was aluminum in the [[superstructure]], and a single [[funnel|funnel stack]]. New impulse geared [[turbine]] engines, driving four shafts with three-bladed propellers gave a top speed of {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}}, which was better than most contemporary cruiser designs and the ''Mogami'' class has twin balanced rudders, rather than the single rudder of previous Japanese cruiser designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;/&gt;

The class was designed from the start to be upgraded into [[heavy cruiser]]s with the replacement of their main battery with [[20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval gun]]s in twin turrets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;/&gt;

However, in initial trials in 1935, ''Mogami'' and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Mikuma||2}}  were plagued with technical problems due to their untested equipment, welding defects, and also proved to be top-heavy with stability problems in heavy weather. Both vessels, and their yet-to-be-completed [[Sister ship|sisters]], ''Kumano'' and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Suzuya|1934|2}} underwent a complete and very costly rebuilding program. Once rebuilt, the design, with its very high speed, armor protection, and heavy armament was among the best in the world during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;/&gt;

==Service career==

===Early career===
[[File:Kumano-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Kumano'' before the refit]]
''Kumano'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] at [[Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation|Kawasaki Shipyards]] in [[Kobe]] on 4 April 1934, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 October 1936 and completed on 31 October 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nishida&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Nishida| first = Hiroshi| url = http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0333.htm| title = Materials of IJN|  work = Imperial Japanese Navy| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first captain was Captain [[Shōji Nishimura]],  who oversaw her completion and remained captain until May 1939, although she almost immediately underwent modification work at [[Kure Naval Arsenal]] which was not completed until October 1939. Her first operational commander was Captain [[Kaoru Arima]], from 15 November 1939 until 15 October 1940.  From 16 July 1941, ''Kumano'' was part of ''[[Sentai]]''-7, together with her sisters ''Mogami'', ''Mikuma'' and ''Suzuya'', and was based out of [[Hainan]] in support of the [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Combined&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Parshall | first = Jon |author2=Bob Hackett |author3=Sander Kingsepp |author4=Allyn Nevitt  | url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/kumano_t.htm  | title = Imperial Japanese Navy Page (Combinedfleet.com)| work =CombinedFleet.com: ''Kumano'' Tabular record of movements | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Kumano'' was the flagship for Vice Admiral [[Inoue Shigeyoshi]]’s IJN 4th Fleet and deployed to cover the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya]] as part of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Jisaburō Ozawa]]'s [[Southern Expeditionary Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|First Southern Expeditionary Fleet]], providing close support for landings of Japanese troops at [[Singora]], [[Pattani, Thailand|Pattani]] and [[Kota Bharu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitley&quot;/&gt;

On 9 December 1941, the {{Jsub|I-65}} reported sighting of [[Royal Navy]] [[Force Z]] (the Royal Navy [[battleship]] {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} and supporting [[destroyer]]s). The report was received by [[light cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Sendai||2}}, which relayed the message to Admiral Ozawa aboard {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Chōkai||2}}. However, the reception was poor and the message took another 90 minutes to decode. Moreover, ''I-65''{{'}}s report was incorrect about the heading of Force Z. Two [[Aichi E13A]]1 &quot;Jake&quot; floatplanes from ''Suzuya'' and ''Kumano'' attempted to shadow Force Z, but both were forced to ditch due to lack of fuel. Only ''Suzuya''{{'}}s crew was recovered. The following day, Force Z was overwhelmed by [[torpedo bomber]]s of the 22nd Air Flotilla from Indochina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Combined&quot;/&gt;

In December 1941, ''Kumano'' was tasked with the invasion of [[Sarawak]], together with ''Suzuya'', covering landings of Japanese troops at [[Miri]]. From her base at [[Cam Rahn Bay]], she sortied with ''Suzuya'' to cover landings of troops at [[Anambas]], [[Endau]], [[Palembang]] and [[Banka Island]], [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]] on [[Sumatra]] and [[Java]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] from the end of December 1941 to the middle of March. ''Kumano'' also participated in the seizure of the [[Andaman Islands]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] on 20 March 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Combined&quot;/&gt;

On 6 April 1942 during the [[Indian Ocean Raid]], ''Kumano'' and ''Suzuya'' together with [[destroyer]] {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Shirakumo|1927|2}} sank the British steamships ''Silksworth'' (4921 tons), ''Autolycus'' (7621 tons), ''Malda'' (9066 tons) and ''Shinkuang'' (2441 tons) and the American Export Line steamship ''Exmoor'' (4986 tons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Klemen |last=L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/allied_losses.html |title=Allied Merchant Ship Losses in the Pacific and Southeast Asia |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one of the E8N floatplanes from ''Kumano'' was damaged by a [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk]] from [[No. 5 Squadron RAF|RAF No.5 squadron]] based at [[Cuttack]], [[British India|India]]. ''Kumano'' was withdrawn back to Japan, arriving at Kure Naval Arsenal on 27 April. On 26 May, she arrived at [[Guam]] to join the escort for the Midway Invasion Transport Group under ''Sentai ''-7 (Rear Admiral [[Raizō Tanaka]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Combined&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Battle of Midway]], on 5 June, lookouts aboard ''Kumano'' spotted the surfaced USN [[submarine]] {{USS|Tambor|SS-198|2}}, and ''Kumano'' signaled a 45-degree simultaneous turn to avoid possible torpedoes. ''Kumano'' and ''Suzuya'' correctly made the turn, but the third vessel in line, ''Mikuma'', made a 90-degree turn by mistake. The error resulted in a collision in which ''Mikuma'' was rammed by ''Mogami''. ''Kumano'' returned to Kure on 23 June. On 17 July, ''Kumano'' and ''Suzuya'' were assigned to provide support for the [[Japanese invasion of Burma]], and evaded six torpedoes fired by the [[Royal Dutch Navy]] submarine {{HNLMS|O 23||2}} west of [[Perak]], Malaya on 29 July. In August, ''Kumano'' and ''Suzuya'' were reassigned to support the reinforcement of [[Guadalcanal]]. During the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] on 24 August, ''Kumano'' escaped without seeing combat and returned safely to Truk. However, she was attacked on 14 September north of the [[Solomon Islands]] by a flight of ten [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers, and suffered light damage. During the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Battle of Santa Cruz]] on 26 October, she provided support for Admiral Nagumo’s Carrier Strike Force, but did not see any combat. She returned to Kure on 7 November and after minor repairs, returned to [[Rabaul]] on 4 December with a cargo of troops and supplies. The cruiser continued to remain in the area on patrols and on fast transport missions through the middle of February 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Combined&quot;/&gt;

Returning to Kure Naval Arsenal on 6 June, ''Kumano'' was fitted with a Type 21 radar and her dual 13-mm machine guns were replaced by two triple-mount Type 96 anti-aircraft guns. She returned to Rabaul on 25 June with another cargo of troops and supplies. On 18 July, ''Kumano'' was escorting a [[Tokyo Express]] high speed transport mission with ''Chōkai'' and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Sendai||2}}, but was attacked off of [[Kolombangara]] by [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from Guadalcanal. The attack damaged ''Kumano''’s aft hull, and she underwent emergency repairs at Rabaul by the repair ship ''Yamabiko Maru'' and at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] by the repair ship {{ship|Japanese repair ship|Akashi||2}}, but finally had to be withdrawn back to Kure from 2 September to 3 November for proper repairs. She was based out of Truk through the end of the year, at [[Palau]] in January and February 1944, and in [[Singapore]] from March through mid-May. At Singapore, an additional eight single-mount Type 96 guns were added. From late May through June, ''Kumano'' was based at [[Tawi-Tawi]].  During the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], on 20 June 1944 she was attacked by aircraft from the [[aircraft carrier]]s {{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|6}}, {{USS|Monterey|CVL-26|2}}, and {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|2}}. During this action, the carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiyō||2}} was sunk and the [[battleship]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}} was badly damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Combined&quot;/&gt; ''Kumano'' returned to Kure on 25 June, and additional Type 13 and Type 22 radars were installed, as were more Type 96 AA guns.&lt;ref name=Patton/&gt; She departed on 8 July with reinforcements and supplies for Singapore, arriving 16 July.

On 25 October 1944, ''Kumano'' was part of the Japanese Central Force in the [[Battle off Samar]]. She was hit by a [[List of torpedoes#Mark 15|Mk-15]] [[torpedo]] fired by the destroyer {{USS|Johnston|DD-557|6}}, which blew off her [[Bow (ship)|bow]]. As ''Kumano'' was retiring toward the [[San Bernardino Strait]], she came under aerial attack and suffered minor damage. The next day, 26 October ''Kumano'' was attacked from aircraft launched by the carrier {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|6}} while in the [[Sibuyan Sea]], and was struck by three {{convert|500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} bombs. She survived and sailed to [[Manila Bay]] for repairs on her bow and all four boilers. While still under repairs, she was attacked on 29 October by carrier aircraft from [[Task Force 38]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Combined&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Japanese cruiser under attack 26 October 1944.jpg|thumb|left|''Kumano'' under attack, 26 October 1944.]]
She returned to service on 4 November, departing Manila for [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]] as part of the escort for Convoy Ma-Ta&amp;nbsp;31. On 6 November 1944 off [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Cape Bolinao, Luzon]], the convoy came under attack by a U.S. submarine [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] consisting of {{USS|Batfish|SS-310|2}}, {{USS|Guitarro|SS-363|2}}, {{USS|Bream|SS-243|2}}, {{USS|Raton|SS-270|2}} and {{USS|Ray|SS-271|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Combined&quot;/&gt;

In all, the American submarines launched 23 torpedoes toward the convoy, two of which struck ''Kumano''. Of the aforementioned U.S. submarines, ''Ray'' inflicted the most severe damage on ''Kumano''. The first hit destroyed her recently replaced bow, and the second damaged her starboard engine room, flooding all four of her engine rooms. She took on an 11° list and lost steerage. At 19:30, she was towed to [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol Bay]] by the cargo ship ''Doryo Maru'', and from there she was moved to Santa Cruz on Luzon.

While undergoing repairs in Santa Cruz on 25 November, ''Kumano'' came under attack by aircraft launched by the carrier {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}. She was hit by five torpedoes and four {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs, and at 15:15 she rolled over and sank in about {{convert|31|m|ft|abbr=on}} of water. Of her crew at the time, 497 were lost with the ship and 636 were rescued. She was removed from the [[navy list]] on 20 January 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Combined&quot;/&gt;

Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.|William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey]] reportedly once remarked that &quot;if there was a Japanese ship I could feel sorry for at all, it would be the ''Kumano''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tully | first = Anthony P | url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/atully04.htm| title =Ship of Nine Lives: The long struggle of cruiser KUMANO| work = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
