'''Mehmed II''' ({{lang-ota|محمد ثانى}}, ''Meḥmed-i &lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;ānī''; Modern {{lang-tr|II. Mehmed}} {{IPA-tu|ˈmeh.met}}; 30 March 1432 – 3 May 1481), best known as '''Mehmed the Conqueror''' ({{lang-tr|links=no|Fatih Sultan Mehmet Han}}), was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]] who ruled first for a short time from August 1444 to September 1446, and later from February 1451 to May 1481. At the age of 21, he [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] [[Constantinople]] (modern-day [[Istanbul]]) and brought an end to the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]. Mehmed continued his conquests in [[Anatolia]] with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as [[Bosnia]]. Mehmed is considered a hero in modern-day [[Turkey]] and parts of the wider [[Muslim world]]. Among other things, Istanbul's [[Fatih]] district, [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] and [[Fatih Mosque, Istanbul|Fatih Mosque]] are named after him.

== Early reign ==
[[File:Hunername accession Mehmed II.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Accession of Mehmed II in [[Edirne]], 1451]]
Mehmed II was born on 30 March 1432, in [[Edirne]], then the capital city of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman state]]. His father was Sultan [[Murad II]] (1404–51) and his mother [[Hüma Hatun|Hüma Valide Hatun]], born in the town of [[Devrekani]], [[Kastamonu]]. 

When Mehmed II was eleven years old he was sent to [[Amasya]] to govern and thus gain experience, as per the custom of Ottoman rulers before his time. Sultan Murad II also sent a number of teachers for him to study under.&lt;ref&gt;^ الشقائق النعمانية في علماء الدولة العثمانية، صفحة 52 نقلاً عن تاريخ الدولة العثمانية، صفحة 43&lt;/ref&gt; This Islamic education had a great impact in molding Mehmet's mindset and reinforcing his Muslim beliefs. He was influenced in his practice of Islamic epistemology by practitioners of science - particularly by his mentor, Molla Gürani - and he followed their approach. The influence of [[Akshamsaddin]] in Mehmed's life became predominant from a young age, especially in the imperative of fulfilling his Islamic duty to overthrow the Byzantine empire by conquering Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;الفتوح الإسلامية عبر العصور، د. عبد العزيز العمري، صفحة 358-359&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Murad II made peace with the [[Karamanids]] in [[Anatolia]] in August 1444, he abdicated the throne to his 12-year-old son Mehmed II.

In Mehmed II's first reign, he defeated the crusade led by [[János Hunyadi]] after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the truce [[Peace of Szeged]]. Cardinal [[Julian Cesarini]], the representative of the pope, had convinced the king of Hungary that breaking the truce with Muslims was not a betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;تاريخ الدولة العليّة العثمانية، تأليف: الأستاذ محمد فريد بك المحامي، تحقيق: الدكتور إحسان حقي، دار النفائس، الطبعة العاشرة: 1427 هـ - 2006 م، صفحة: 157 ISBN 9953-18-084-9&lt;/ref&gt;
At this time Mehmed II asked his father Murad II to reclaim the throne, but Murad II refused. Angry at his father, who had long since retired to a contemplative life in southwestern [[Anatolia]], Mehmed II wrote, &quot;If you are the Sultan, come and lead your armies. If I am the Sultan I hereby order you to come and lead my armies.&quot;  It was only after receiving this letter that Murad II led the Ottoman army and won the [[Battle of Varna]] in 1444.

Murad II's return to the throne was forced by [[Çandarlı (2nd) Halil Pasha|Çandarlı Halil Paşa]], the [[grand vizier]] at the time, who was not fond of Mehmed II's rule, because Mehmed II's influential [[lala (title)|lala]] (royal teacher), Akshamseddin, had a rivalry with Çandarlı.

== Conquest of Constantinople ==
{{Main|Fall of Constantinople}}
[[File:OttomanEmpire1451.png|thumb|The Ottoman Empire at the beginning of Mehmed II's second reign.]]
[[File:Turkey-1290.jpg|thumb|[[Roumeli Hissar Castle]], built by Sultan Mehmed II between 1451 and 1452, before the [[Fall of Constantinople]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8836/|title= Bosphorus (i.e. Bosporus), View from Kuleli, Constantinople, Turkey|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=1890–1900 |accessdate = 2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

When Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451 he devoted himself to strengthening the Ottoman navy and made preparations for the taking of Constantinople. In the narrow [[Bosphorus|Bosphorus Straits]], the fortress [[Anadoluhisarı]] had been built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]] on the Asian side; Mehmed erected an even stronger fortress called [[Rumelihisarı]] on the European side, and thus gained complete control of the strait. Having completed his fortresses, Mehmed proceeded to levy a toll on ships passing within reach of their cannon. A [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] vessel ignoring signals to stop was sunk with a single shot and all the surviving sailors beheaded,&lt;ref name=&quot;Silburn1912&quot;&gt;Silburn, P. A. B. (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; except for the captain, who was impaled and mounted as a human scarecrow as a warning to further sailors on the strait.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03l2shc&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]], the companion and standard bearer of Muhammad, had died during the first [[Siege of Constantinople (674–78)]].  As Mehmed II's army approached Constantinople, Mehmed's sheikh [[Akshamseddin]]&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated23&quot;&gt;The Sultan of Vezirs: The Life and Times of the Ottoman Grand Vezir Mahmud, Théoharis Stavrides, page 23, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; discovered the tomb of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari.  After the conquest, Mehmed built [[Eyüp Sultan Mosque]] at the site to emphasize the importance of the conquest to the Islamic world and highlight his role as [[Ghazi warriors|ghazi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated23&quot;/&gt;
 
In 1453 Mehmed commenced the siege of Constantinople with an army between 80,000 and 200,000 troops, an artillery train of over seventy large field pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold (2001) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and a navy of 320 vessels, the bulk of them transports and storeships. The city was surrounded by sea and land; the fleet at the entrance of the [[Bosphorus]] stretched from shore to shore in the form of a crescent, to intercept or repel any assistance for Constantinople from the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silburn1912&quot;/&gt; In early April, the [[Fall of Constantinople|Siege of Constantinople]] began. At first, the city's walls held off the Turks, even though Mehmed's army used the new bombard designed by [[Orban]], a giant cannon similar to the [[Dardanelles Gun]]. The harbor of the [[Golden Horn]] was blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] and defended by twenty-eight [[warship]]s.

On 22 April, Mehmed transported his lighter warships overland, around the [[Republic_of_Genoa|Genoese]] [[Genoese_colonies|colony]] of [[Galata]], and into the Golden Horn's northern shore; eighty galleys were transported from the Bosphorus after paving a route, little over one mile, with wood. Thus the Byzantines stretched their troops over a longer portion of the walls. About a month later, Constantinople fell, on 29 May, following a fifty-seven-day siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silburn1912&quot;/&gt; After this conquest, Mehmed moved the Ottoman capital from Adrianople to Constantinople.

When Sultan Mehmed II stepped into the ruins of the [[Boukoleon Palace|Boukoleon]], known to the Ottomans and Persians as the Palace of the Caesars, probably built over a thousand years before by [[Theodosius II]], he uttered the famous lines of [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]]:&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare'', Jim Bradbury, page 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sultan of Vezirs'':, Théoharis Stavrides, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''East and West in the Crusader States'': Krijna Nelly Ciggaar, Adelbert Davids, Herman G. B. Teule, page 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Lord of the Panther-Skin'', Shota Rustaveli, page xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

of Afrasiab.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[File:Zonaro GatesofConst.jpg|thumb|The entry of Sultan Mehmed II into [[Constantinople]], painting by [[Fausto Zonaro]] (1854-1929)]]

After the conquest of Constantinople, Mehmed claimed the title &quot;[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]&quot; of the [[Roman Empire]] (''Qayser-i Rûm''), based on the assertion that Constantinople had been the seat and capital of the [[Roman Empire]] since 330 AD, and whoever possessed the Imperial capital was the ruler of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2004/12/19/pazar/yazortay.html&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary scholar [[George of Trebizond]] supported his claim.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/constantinople.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=ftOp1cR7VK8C&amp;pg=PT13&amp;lpg=PT13&amp;dq=%22The+seat+of+the+Roman+Empire+is+Constantinople.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PquK438sn9&amp;sig=D0Ya8dmoDcswPwMdAWR6dmPXHOw&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAWoVChMIvcjf2J2SyQIVBBQsCh21ygdB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20seat%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire%20is%20Constantinople%2C%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was recognized by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], but not by the [[Catholic Church]] and most of, if not all, Western [[Europe]].[[Gennadius Scholarius]], a staunch antagonist of the West because of the [[Sack of Constantinople]] committed by the Western Catholics led by Latins and theological controversies between the two Churches, had been enthroned the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople-New Rome]] with all the ceremonial elements, ethnarch (or ''milletbashi'') status and rights of property that made him the second largest landlord in the said empire by the Sultan himself in 1454, and in turn Gennadius II recognized Mehmed the Conqueror as successor to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;http://global.britannica.com/biography/Gennadios-II-Scholarios&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/Was-the-Ottoman-Empire-the-legitimate-successor-of-the-Roman-Empire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.patriarchate.org/list-of-ecumenical-patriarchs?p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_u1pdiOuFkFSc&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-1&amp;p_p_col_pos=1&amp;p_p_col_count=2&amp;_101_INSTANCE_u1pdiOuFkFSc_delta=20&amp;_101_INSTANCE_u1pdiOuFkFSc_keywords=&amp;_101_INSTANCE_u1pdiOuFkFSc_advancedSearch=false&amp;_101_INSTANCE_u1pdiOuFkFSc_andOperator=true&amp;p_r_p_564233524_resetCur=false&amp;_101_INSTANCE_u1pdiOuFkFSc_cur=6&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed also had a blood lineage to the Byzantine Imperial family: his predecessor, Sultan [[Orhan I]], had married a Byzantine princess, and Mehmed claimed descent from [[John Tzelepes Komnenos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich 1995 413–416&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|authorlink=John Julius Norwich|year=1995|title=Byzantium:The Decline and Fall| pages=81–82|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-679-41650-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not the only ruler to claim such a title; [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]], emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Western Europe, traced his lineage from [[Charlemagne]], who had taken the title of Roman Emperor when he was crowned by [[Pope Leo III]] in 800&amp;nbsp;– although never recognized as such by the Byzantine Empire.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine XI]] died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen to the Ottomans he likely would have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother. Those children were taken into the palace service of Mehmed after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed Has Murad, became a personal favorite of Mehmed and served as [[Beylerbey]] (Governor-General) of the [[Balkans]]. The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and [[Sanjak-bey]] (Governor) of the [[Sanjak of Gelibolu|Province of Gallipoli]]. He eventually served twice as [[Grand Vizier]] under Mehmed's son, [[Bayezid II]].&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, Heath W. (2003). ''The Nature of the Early Ottoman State''. Albany, NY: SUNY Press. p. 115-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Fall of Constantinople, Mehmed would also go on to conquer the [[Despotate of Morea]] in the [[Peloponnese]] in 1460, and the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in northeastern [[Anatolia]] in 1461. The last two vestiges of Byzantine rule were thus absorbed by the Ottoman Empire. The conquest of Constantinople bestowed immense glory and prestige on the country. There is some historical evidence that, 10 years after the conquest of Constantinople, Mehmed II visited the site of [[Troy]] and boasted that he had avenged the Trojans by conquering the Greeks (Byzantines).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Wood|title=In Search of the Trojan War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5HDjtGwYjsC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21599-3|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Konuk2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kader Konuk|title=East West Mimesis: Auerbach in Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDGhU1g9hM0C&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=3 May 2013|date=21 September 2010|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-7575-5|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Freely2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John Freely|title=The Grand Turk: Sultan Mehmet II - Conqueror of Constantinople and Master of an Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ybm4b0xItDEC&amp;pg=PT95|accessdate=3 May 2013|date=1 October 2009|publisher=Overlook|isbn=978-1-59020-449-8|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conquest of Serbia (1454–1459) ==
{{further|List of campaigns of Mehmed the Conqueror}}
[[File:Siegebelgrade.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman miniature]] of the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], 1456]]
Mehmed II's first campaigns after Constantinople were in the direction of Serbia, which had been an Ottoman [[vassal state]] since the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389. The Ottoman ruler had a connection with the [[Serbian Despotate]] – one of [[Murad II]]'s wives was [[Mara Branković]] – and he used that fact to claim some Serbian islands. That [[Đurađ Branković]] had recently made an alliance with the Hungarians, and had paid the tribute irregularly, may have been important considerations. When Serbia refused these demands, the Ottoman army set out from [[Edirne]] towards Serbia in 1454. [[Smederevo]] was besieged, as was [[Novo Brdo]], the most important Serbian metal mining and smelting center. Ottomans and Hungarians fought during the years till 1456.

The Ottoman army advanced as far as [[Belgrade]], where it attempted but failed to conquer the city from [[John Hunyadi]] at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], on 14 July 1456. A period of relative peace ensued in the region until the [[Siege of Belgrade 1521|Fall of Belgrade]] in 1521, during the reign of Mehmed's great-grandson, known as Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The sultan retreated to Edirne, and [[Đurađ Branković]] regained possession of some parts of Serbia. Before the end of the year, however, the 79-year-old Branković died.  Serbian independence survived him for only two years, when the Ottoman Empire formally annexed his lands following dissension among his widow and three remaining sons. Lazar, the youngest, poisoned his mother and exiled his brothers, but he died soon afterwards. In the continuing turmoil the oldest brother [[Stefan Branković]] gained the throne but was ousted in March 1459. After that the Serbian throne was offered to [[Stephen Tomašević]], the future king of Bosnia, which infuriated Sultan Mehmed. He sent his army, which captured Smederevo in June 1459, ending the existence of the [[Serbian Despotate]].&lt;ref name=Miller1&gt;{{cite book |title=The Balkans: Roumania, Bulgaria, Servia, and Montenegro |last=Miller |first=William |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1896 |publisher=G.P.

== Conquest of Morea (1458–1460) ==
The [[Despotate of the Morea]] bordered the southern Ottoman Balkans. The Ottomans had already invaded the region under [[Murad II]], destroying the Byzantine defences — the [[Hexamilion wall]] — at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] in 1446. Before the final siege of [[Constantinople]] Mehmed ordered Ottoman troops to attack the Morea. The despots, [[Demetrios Palaiologos]] and [[Thomas Palaiologos]], brothers of the last emperor, failed to send any aid. Their own incompetence resulted in an [[Morea revolt of 1453–1454|Albanian-Greek revolt]] against them, during which they invited in Ottoman troops to help put down the revolt. At this time, a number of influential Moreote Greeks and Albanians made private peace with Mehmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://angiolello.net/ARCHONS.pdf |title=Contemporary Copy of the Letter of Mehmet II to the Greek Archons 26 December 1454 (ASV Documenti Turchi B.1/11) |publisher=Angiolello.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After more years of incompetent rule by the despots, their failure to pay their annual tribute to the Sultan, and finally their own revolt against Ottoman rule, Mehmed entered the Morea in May 1460. Demetrios ended up a prisoner of the Ottomans and his younger brother Thomas fled. By the end of the summer the Ottomans had achieved the submission of virtually all cities possessed by the Greeks.

A few holdouts remained for a time. The island of [[Monemvasia]] refused to surrender, and it was ruled for a brief time by a Catalan corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained the consent of Thomas to submit to the Pope's protection before the end of 1460. The [[Mani Peninsula]], on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose coalition of local clans, and the area then came under the rule of [[Venice]]. The very last holdout was [[Salmeniko]], in the Morea's northwest. [[Graitzas Palaiologos]] was the military commander there, stationed at [[Salmeniko Castle]] (also known as Castle Orgia). While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.

[[File:Evpatoria-09.jpg|thumb|A [[bas-relief]] of Mehmed the Conqueror in [[Yevpatoria]], [[Ukraine]]]]

Emperors of Trebizond formed alliances through royal marriages with various Muslim rulers. Emperor [[John IV of Trebizond]] married his daughter to the son of his brother-in-law, [[Uzun Hasan]], khan of the [[Ak Koyunlu]], in return for his promise to defend Trebizond. He also secured promises of support from the Turkish [[bey]]s of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] and [[Karamanid|Karamania]], and from the king and princes of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The Ottomans were motivated to capture Trebizond or to get an annual tribute. In the time of Murad II they first attempted to take the capital by sea in 1442, but high surf made the landings difficult and the attempt was repulsed. While Mehmed II was away laying siege to [[Belgrade]] in 1456, the Ottoman governor of [[Amasya]] attacked Trebizond, and although he was defeated, he took many prisoners and extracted a heavy tribute.

After John's death in 1459, his brother [[David of Trebizond|David]] came to power and intrigued with various European powers for help against the Ottomans, speaking of wild schemes that included the conquest of [[Jerusalem]]. Mehmed II eventually heard of these intrigues and was further provoked to action by David's demand that Mehmed remit the tribute imposed on his brother.

Mehmed the Conqueror's response came in the summer of 1461. He led a sizable army from [[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]] by land and the Ottoman navy by sea, first to [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], joining forces with Ismail's brother Ahmed (the Red). He captured Sinope and ended the official reign of the Jandarid dynasty, although he appointed Ahmed as the governor of Kastamonu and Sinope, only to revoke the appointment the same year. Various other members of the Jandarid dynasty were offered important functions throughout the history of the Ottoman Empire. During the march to Trebizond, [[Uzun Hasan]] sent his mother Sara Khatun as an ambassador; while they were climbing the steep heights of [[Zigana]] on foot, she asked Sultan Mehmed why he was undergoing such hardship for the sake of Trebizond. Mehmed replied:

{{quote|Mother, in my hand is the sword of Islam, without this hardship I should not deserve the name of ''[[Ghazi warriors|ghazi]]'', and today and tomorrow I should have to cover my face in shame before [[Allah]].&lt;ref&gt;Babinger, 193&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Having isolated Trebizond, Mehmed quickly swept down upon it before the inhabitants knew he was coming, and he placed it [[Siege of Trebizond (1461)|under siege]]. The city held out for a month before the emperor David surrendered on 15 August 1461.

== Submission of Wallachia (1459–1462) ==
[[File:Vlad Tepes 002.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad (Dracula) the Impaler]], Prince of [[Wallachia]], 1460]]

The Ottomans since the early 15th century tried to bring Wallachia ({{lang-ota|والاچیا}}) under their control by putting their own candidate on the throne, but each attempt ended in failure. The Ottomans regarded Wallachia as a buffer zone between them and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and for a yearly tribute did not meddle in their internal affairs. The two primary Balkan powers, Hungary and the Ottomans, maintained an enduring struggle to make Wallachia their own vassal. To prevent Wallachia from falling into the Hungarian fold, the Ottomans freed young [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III]] (Dracula), who had spent four years as a prisoner of Murad, together with his brother [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]], so that Vlad could claim the throne of Wallachia. His rule was short-lived, however, as Hunyadi invaded Wallachia and restored his ally [[Vladislav II of Wallachia|Vladislav II]], of the [[House of Dănești|Dănești]] clan, to the throne.

Vlad III Dracula fled to Moldavia, where he lived under the protection of his uncle, [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]]. In October 1451, Bogdan was assassinated and Vlad fled to Hungary. Impressed by Vlad's vast knowledge of the mindset and inner workings of the Ottoman Empire, as well as his hatred towards the Turks and new Sultan Mehmed II, Hunyadi reconciled with his former enemy and tried to make Vlad III his own adviser, but Vlad refused.

In 1456, three years after the Ottomans had conquered Constantinople, they threatened Hungary by besieging [[Belgrade]]. Hunyadi began a concerted counter-attack in [[Serbia]]: while he himself moved into Serbia and relieved the siege (before dying of the plague), Vlad III Dracula led his own contingent into Wallachia, reconquered his native land, and killed the imposter Vladislav II.

[[File:AtaculdeNoapte.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Night Attack of Târgovişte]], which resulted in the victory of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad (Dracula) the Impaler]].]]

In 1459, Mehmed II sent envoys to Vlad to urge him to pay a delayed [[tribute]]&lt;ref name=mtcant&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Babinger | first1 = Franz | title = Mehmed the Conqeror - And his Time| year = 1978| publisher = Princeton University Press | isbn = 0691099006}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 10,000 ducats and 500 recruits into the Ottoman forces. Vlad III Dracula refused and had the Ottoman envoys killed by nailing their [[turban]]s to their heads, on the pretext that they had refused to raise their &quot;hats&quot; to him, as they only removed their headgear before Allah.

Meanwhile, the Sultan sent the Bey of Nicopolis, Hamza Pasha, to make peace and, if necessary, eliminate Vlad III.&lt;ref name=explore&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringromania.com/vlad-the-impaler-3.html |title=Vlad the Impaler second rule [3&amp;#93; |publisher=Exploringromania.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vlad III set an ambush; the Ottomans were surrounded and almost all of them caught and impaled, with Hamza Pasha impaled on the highest stake, as befit his rank.&lt;ref name=explore/&gt;

In the winter of 1462, Vlad III crossed the Danube and scorched the entire Bulgarian land in the area between [[Serbia]] and the [[Black Sea]]. Allegedly disguising himself as a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Sipahi]] and utilizing his command of the Turkish language and customs, Vlad III infiltrated Ottoman camps, ambushed, massacred or captured several Ottomans forces. In a letter to Corvinus dated 2 February, he wrote:

{{quote|I have killed peasants men and women, old and young, who lived at Oblucitza and Novoselo, where the Danube flows into the sea, up to [[Rahova]], which is located near Chilia, from the lower Danube up to such places as Samovit and Ghighen.

Thus, your highness, you must know that I have broken the peace with him [Mehmed II].&lt;ref name=Vlad&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/rsa/_content/_public/_htm/dracula.shtml |title=Dracula: Between Myth and Reality |author=Adrian Axinte}} Student paper for Romanian Student Association, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=August 2015|reason=Self-published student paper.}}}}

Mehmed II abandoned his siege of Corinth to launch a punitive attack against Vlad III in Wallachia&lt;ref&gt;''Mehmed the Conqueror and his time'' pp. 204-5&lt;/ref&gt; but suffered many casualties in a surprise [[The Night Attack|night attack]] led by Vlad III Dracula, who was apparently bent on personally killing the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;''Dracula: Prince of many faces - His life and his times'' p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that when the forces of Mehmed the Conqueror and Radu the Handsome came to Târgoviste, they saw so many Turks impaled around the city that, appalled by the sight, Mehmed considered withdrawing but was convinced by his commanders to stay. However, Vlad's policy of staunch resistance against the Ottomans was not a popular one, and he was betrayed by the boyars's (local aristocracy) appeasing faction, most of them also pro-Dăneşti (a rival princely branch). His best friend and ally [[Stephen III of Moldavia]], who had promised to help him, seized the chance and instead attacked him trying to take back the fortress of Chilia . Vlad III had to retreat to the mountains. After this, the Ottomans captured the Wallachian capital [[Târgoviște]] and Mehmed II withdrew, having left Radu as ruler of Wallachia. [[Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey]], who served with distinction and wiped out a force 6,000 Wallachians and deposited 2,000 of their heads at the feet of Mehmed II, was also reinstated, as a reward, in his old gubernatorial post in Thessaly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babinger|1992|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vlad eventually escaped to Hungary, where he was imprisoned on a false accusation of treason against his overlord, [[Matthias Corvinus]].

== Conquest of Bosnia (1463) ==
[[File:Mehmed II ferman.jpg|thumb|Mehmed II's [[ahidnâme]] to the Catholic monks of the recently conquered Bosnia issued in 1463, granting them full religious freedom and protection.]]

The despot of Serbia, [[Lazar Branković]], died in 1458, and a civil war broke out among his heirs that resulted in the Ottoman conquest of Serbia in 1459. [[Stephen Tomašević]], son of the king of Bosnia, tried to bring Serbia under his control, but Ottoman expeditions forced him to give up his plan and Stephen fled to Bosnia, seeking refuge at the court of his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Fine 1994 page 575-581&quot;&gt;J. V. A. Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans, A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest'' (1994), page 575-581&lt;/ref&gt; After some battles Bosnia became tributary kingdom to the Ottomans.

On 10 July 1461, [[Stephen Thomas of Bosnia|Stephen Thomas]] died, and Stephen Tomašević succeeded him as King of Bosnia. In 1461, Stephen Tomašević made an alliance with the Hungarians and asked [[Pope Pius II]] for help in the face of an impending Ottoman invasion. In 1463, after a dispute over the tribute paid annually by the [[Bosnian Kingdom]] to the Ottomans, he sent for help from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]. However, none ever reached Bosnia. In 1463, Sultan Mehmed II led an army into the country. The royal city of [[Bobovac]] soon fell, leaving Stephen Tomašević to retreat to [[Jajce]] and later to [[Ključ, Una-Sana Canton|Ključ]]. Mehmed invaded Bosnia and conquered it very quickly, executing Stephen Tomašević and his uncle [[Radivoj of Bosnia|Radivoj]]. Bosnia officially fell in 1463 and became the westernmost province of the Ottoman Empire.

==Ottoman-Venetian War (1463–1479)==
{{Main|Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–79)}}
According to the Byzantine historian [[Michael Critobulus]], hostilities broke out after an Albanian slave of the Ottoman commander of Athens fled to the Venetian fortress of Coron ([[Koroni]]) with 100,000 silver aspers from his master's treasure. The fugitive then converted to Christianity, so Ottoman demands for his rendition were refused by the Venetian authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton241&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this as a pretext in November 1462, the Ottoman commander in central Greece, [[Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey]], attacked and nearly succeeded in taking the strategically important Venetian fortress of Lepanto ([[Nafpaktos]]). On 3 April 1463, however, the governor of the Morea, Isa Beg, took the Venetian-held town of [[Argos]] by treason.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton241&quot;/&gt;

The new alliance launched a two-pronged offensive against the Ottomans: a Venetian army, under the Captain General of the Sea [[Alvise Loredan]], landed in the Morea, while [[Matthias Corvinus]] invaded Bosnia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkel63&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2006|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Pius II]] began assembling an army at [[Ancona]], hoping to lead it in person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw65&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1976|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were also begun with other rivals of the Ottomans, such as [[Karamanids]], [[Uzun Hassan]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw65&quot;/&gt;

In early August, the Venetians retook [[Argos]] and refortified the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], restoring the [[Hexamilion wall]] and equipping it with many cannons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton248&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the [[Acrocorinth]], which controlled the northwestern Peloponnese. The Venetians engaged in repeated clashes with the defenders and with Ömer Bey's forces, until they suffered a major defeat on 20 October and were then forced to lift the siege and retreat to the Hexamilion and to Nauplia ([[Nafplion]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton248&quot;/&gt; In Bosnia, Matthias Corvinus seized over sixty fortified places and succeeded in taking its capital, [[Jajce]], [[Siege of Jajce|after a 3-month siege]], on 16 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton250&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottoman reaction was swift and decisive: Mehmed II dispatched his [[Grand Vizier]], [[Mahmud Pasha Angelović]], with an army against the Venetians. To confront the Venetian fleet, which had taken station outside the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] Straits, the Sultan further ordered the creation of the new shipyard of Kadirga Limani in the [[Golden Horn]] (named after the &quot;kadirga&quot; type of [[galley]]), and of two forts to guard the Straits, [[Kilitbahir Castle|Kilidulbahr]] and [[Çanakkale|Sultaniye]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crusades326&quot;&gt;Setton, Hazard &amp; Norman (1969), p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; The Morean campaign was swiftly victorious for the Ottomans; they razed the Hexamilion, and advanced into the Morea. Argos fell, and several forts and localities that had recognized Venetian authority reverted to their Ottoman allegiance.

Sultan Mehmed II, who was following Mahmud Pasha with another army to reinforce him, had reached Zeitounion ([[Lamia (city)|Lamia]]) before being apprised of his Vizier's success. Immediately, he turned his men north, towards Bosnia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crusades326&quot;/&gt; However, the Sultan's attempt to retake Jajce in July and August 1464 failed, with the Ottomans retreating hastily in the face of Corvinus' approaching army. A new Ottoman army under Mahmud Pasha then forced Corvinus to withdraw, but Jajce was not retaken for many years after.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton250&quot;/&gt; However, the death of Pope Pius II on 15 August in Ancona spelled the end of the Crusade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw65&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the Venetian Republic had appointed [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta|Sigismondo Malatesta]] for the upcoming campaign of 1464. He launched attacks against Ottoman forts and engaged in a failed siege of [[Mistra]] in August through October. Small-scale warfare continued on both sides, with raids and counter-raids, but a shortage of manpower and money meant that the Venetians remained largely confined to their fortified bases, while Ömer Bey's army roamed the countryside.

In the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the Venetians tried to take Lesbos in the spring of 1464, and besieged the capital [[Mytilene]] for six weeks, until the arrival of an Ottoman fleet under Mahmud Pasha on 18 May forced them to withdraw.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton251&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another attempt to capture the island shortly after also failed. The Venetian navy spent the remainder of the year in ultimately fruitless demonstrations of force before the Dardanelles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton251&quot;/&gt; In early 1465, Mehmed II sent peace feelers to the Venetian Senate; distrusting the Sultan's motives, these were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1466, the Venetian war effort was reinvigorated under [[Vettore Cappello]]: the fleet took the northern Aegean islands of [[Imbros]], [[Thasos]], and [[Samothrace]], and then sailed into the [[Saronic Gulf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton283&quot;/&gt; On 12 July, Cappello landed at [[Piraeus]] and marched against [[Athens]], the Ottomans' major regional base. He failed to take the [[Acropolis]] and was forced to retreat to [[Patras]], the capital of Peloponnese and the seat of the Ottoman [[Bey]], which was being besieged by a joint force of Venetians and [[Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Spyridon Trikoupis]], ''Istoria tis Ellinikis Epanastaseos'' (London, 1853–1857) Vol 2, p84-85&lt;/ref&gt; Before Cappello could arrive, and as the city seemed on the verge of falling, Ömer Bey suddenly appeared with 12,000 cavalry and drove the outnumbered besiegers off. Six hundred Venetians and a hundred Greeks were taken prisoner out of a force of 2,000, while Barbarigo himself was killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton284&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cappello, who arrived some days later, attacked the Ottomans but was heavily defeated. Demoralized, he returned to Negroponte with the remains of his army. There Cappello fell ill and died on 13 March 1467.&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1978), pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; In 1470 Mehmed personally led an Ottoman army to [[Siege of Negroponte (1470)|besiege Negroponte]]. The Venetian relief navy was defeated and Negroponte was captured.

[[File:&quot;I Turchi respinti da Scutari&quot; Gatteri's Etching of the Siege of Shkodra.jpg|thumb|left|Scene depicts the fifth and greatest assault upon the Shkodra Castle by Ottoman forces in the [[Siege of Shkodra]], 1478–79]]

In spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched with a large army against the Albanians. Under their leader, [[Skenderbeg]], they had long resisted the Ottomans, and had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkel63&quot;/&gt; Mehmed II responded by marching again against Albania but [[Third Siege of Krujë|was unsuccessful]]. The winter brought an outbreak of plague, which would recur annually and sap the strength of the local resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton283&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skanderbeg himself died of malaria in the Venetian stronghold of Lissus ([[Lezhë]]), ending the ability of Venice to use the Albanian lords for its own advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkel64&quot;/&gt; After Skanderbeg died, some Venetian-controlled northern Albanian garrisons continued to hold territories coveted by the Ottomans, such as [[Žabljak Crnojevića]], [[Drisht]], [[Lezha]], and [[Shkodra]] — the most significant. Mehmed II sent his armies to take Shkodra in 1474&lt;ref name=&quot;albanianhistory1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts15/AH1474.html |title=1474 &amp;#124; George Merula: The Siege of Shkodra |publisher=Albanianhistory.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000842/http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts15/AH1474.html |archivedate=5 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed. Then he went personally to lead the [[siege of Shkodra]] of 1478-79. The Venetians and Shkodrans resisted the assaults and continued to hold the fortress until Venice ceded Shkodra to the Ottoman Empire in the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1479)|Treaty of Constantinople]] as a condition of ending the war.

The agreement was established as a result of the Ottomans having reached the outskirts of [[Venice]]. Based on the terms of the treaty, the Venetians were allowed to keep [[Ulcinj]], Antivan, and [[Durrës]]. However, they ceded [[Shkodra]], which had been [[Siege of Shkodra|under Ottoman siege]] for many months, as well as other territories on the [[Dalmatia]]n coastline, and they relinquished control of the Greek islands of [[Lordship of Negroponte|Negroponte]] ([[Euboea]]) and [[Lemnos]]. Moreover, the Venetians were forced to pay 100,000 ducat [[indemnity]]&lt;ref&gt;''Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World'': [[Alexander Mikaberidze]], page 917, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and agreed to a tribute of around 10,000 [[ducat]]s per year in order to acquire trading privileges in the [[Black Sea]]. As a result of this treaty, Venice acquired a weakened position in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/67/538.html ''The Encyclopedia of World History'' (2001) - Venice] &quot;The great war against the Turks (See 1463–79). Negroponte was lost (1470). The Turks throughout maintained the upper hand and at times raided to the very outskirts of Venice. In the Treaty of Constantinople (1479), the Venetians gave up Scutari and other Albanian stations, as well as Negroponte and Lemnos. Thenceforth the Venetians paid an annual tribute for permission to trade in the Black Sea.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conquest of Karaman and conflict with the Akkoyunlu (1464–1473) ==
During the post-[[Sultanate of Roum|Seljuks]] era in the second half of the [[middle ages]], numerous [[Oghuz Turk|Turkmen]] principalities collectively known as [[Anatolian beyliks]] emerged in [[Anatolia]]. [[Karamanids]] initially centered around the modern provinces of [[Karaman Province|Karaman]] and [[Konya Province|Konya]], the most important power in Anatolia. But towards the end of the 14th century, Ottomans began to dominate on most of Anatolia, reducing the Karaman influence and prestige.

[[İbrahim II of Karaman]] was the ruler of Karaman, and during his last years, his sons began struggling for the throne. His heir apparent was [[İshak of Karaman]], the governor of [[Silifke]]. But [[Pir Ahmet of Karaman|Pir Ahmet]], a younger son, declared himself as the bey of Karaman in [[Konya]]. İbrahim escaped to a small city in western territories where he died in 1464. The competing claims to the throne resulted in an interregnum in the ''beylik''. Nevertheless, with the help of [[Uzun Hasan]], the sultan of the [[Akkoyunlu]] (White Sheep) [[Oghuz Turks|Turkmens]], İshak was able to ascend to the throne. His reign was short, however, as Pir Ahmet appealed to sultan Mehmet II for help, offering Mehmet some territory that İshak refused to cede. With Ottoman help, Pir Ahmet defeated İshak in the battle of [[Dağpazarı, Mut|Dağpazarı]]. İshak had to be content with Silifke up to an unknown date.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''Türkiye tarihi'' Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 pp 256–257&lt;/ref&gt; Pir Ahmet kept his promise and ceded a part of the ''beylik'' to the Ottomans, but he was uneasy about the loss. So during the Ottoman campaign in the West, he recaptured his former territory. Mehmet returned, however, and captured both Karaman (Larende) and Konya in 1466. Pir Ahmet berely escaped to the East. A few years later, Ottoman [[vizier]] (later [[grand vizier]]) [[Gedik Ahmet Pasha]] captured the coastal region of the ''beylik''.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''Türkiye tarihi'' Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 pp 256–258&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UzunHasan1.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Otlukbeli]] in 1473 is considered by many historians as one of the largest of the 15th century in terms of tactics, technology, and manpower.]]

Pir Ahmet as well as his brother [[Kasım of Karaman|Kasım]] escaped to Uzun Hasan's territory. This gave Uzun Hasan a chance to interfere. In 1472, the Akkoyunlu army invaded and raided most of Anatolia (this was the reason behind the [[Battle of Otlukbeli]] in 1473). But then Mehmed led a successful campaign against Uzun Hasan in 1473 that resulted in the decisive victory of the Ottoman Empire in the [[Battle of Otlukbeli]]. Before that, Pir Ahmet with Akkoyunlu help had captured Karaman. However Pir Ahmet couldn't enjoy another term. Because immediately after the capture of Karaman, the Akkoyunlu army was defeated by the Ottomans near [[Beyşehir]] and Pir Ahmet had to escape once more. Although he tried to continue his struggle, he learned that his family members had been transferred to [[İstanbul]] by Gedik Ahmet Pasha, so he finally gave up. Demoralized, he escaped to Akkoyunlu territory where he was given a ''[[tımar]]'' (fief) in [[Bayburt]]. He died in 1474.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enfal.de/starih40.htm |title=Karamanogullari Beyligi |publisher=Enfal.de |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uniting the Anatolian ''beylik''s was first accomplished by Sultan [[Bayezid I]], more than fifty years before Mehmed II but after the destructive [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, the newly formed unification was gone. Mehmed II recovered Ottoman power over the other Turkish states, and these conquests allowed him to push further into Europe.

Another important political entity that shaped the Eastern policy of Mehmed II were the [[Ak Koyunlu|White Sheep Turcomans]]. Under the leadership of [[Uzun Hasan]], this kingdom gained power in the East; but because of their strong relations with the Christian powers like the Empire of Trebizond and the [[Republic of Venice]], and the alliance between the Turcomans and the Karamanid tribe, Mehmed saw them as a threat to his own power.

== War with Moldavia (1475–1476) ==
[[File:Paolo Veronese 022.jpg|thumb|Mehmed the Second, portrait by [[Paolo Veronese]]]]

In 1456, [[Peter III Aaron]] agreed to pay the Ottomans an annual tribute of 2,000 gold ducats to ensure his southern borders, thus becoming the first Moldavian ruler to accept the Turkish demands.&lt;ref&gt;The A to Z of Moldova, Andrei Brezianu,Vlad Spânu, page 273, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Stephen the Great]] rejected Ottoman suzerainty and a series of fierce wars ensued.&lt;ref&gt;The A to Z of Moldova, Andrei Brezianu,Vlad Spânu, page 242, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen tried to bring Wallachia under his sphere of influence and so supported his own choice for the Wallachian throne. This resulted in an enduring struggle between different Wallachian rulers backed by Hungarians, Ottomans, and Stephen. An Ottoman army under Hadim Pasha was sent in 1475 to punish Stephen for his meddling in Wallachia; however, the Ottomans suffered a great defeat at the [[Battle of Vaslui]]. Mehmed II assembled a large army and entered Moldavia in June 1476. Meanwhile, groups of [[Tartars]] from the [[Crimean Khanate]] (the Ottomans' recent ally) were sent to attack Moldavia. Romanian sources may state that they were repelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;ir&quot;&gt;M. Barbulescu, D. Deletant, K. Hitchins, S. Papacostea, P. Teodor, ''Istoria României (History of Romania)'', Ed. Corint, Bucharest, 2002, ISBN 973-653-215-1, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that joint Ottoman and Crimean Tartar forces &quot;occupied Bessarabia and took Akkerman, gaining control of southern mouth of Danube. Stephan tried to avoid open battle with the Ottomans by following a scorched-earth policy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw&quot;&gt;Shaw, Stanford J. (1976) ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey – Vol 1: Empire of Gazis'', Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-29163-1 p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally Stephen faced the Ottomans in battle. The Moldavians luring the main Ottoman forces into a forest that was set on fire, causing some casualties. According to another battle description, the defending Moldavian forces repelled several Ottoman attacks with steady fire from hand-guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} Akademia, ''[http://www.akademia.ro/articole.php?view=26 Rolul distinctiv al artileriei în marile oști moldovenești] (The special role of artillery in the larger Moldavian armies)'', April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The attacking Turkish [[Janissary|Janissaries]] were forced to crouch on their stomachs instead of charging headlong into the defenders positions. Seeing the imminent defeat of his forces, Mehmed charged with his personal guard against the Moldavians, managing to rally the Janissaries, and turning the tide of the battle. Turkish Janissaries penetrated inside the forest and engaged the defenders in man-to-man fighting.

The Moldavian army was utterly defeated (casualties were very high on both sides), and the [[chronicle]]s say that the entire battlefield was covered with the bones of the dead, a probable source for the [[toponym]] (''Valea Albă'' is [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and  ''Akdere'' [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for &quot;The White Valley&quot;).

Ștefan cel Mare retreated into the north-western part of Moldavia or even into the [[History of Poland (1385–1569)|Polish Kingdom]]&lt;ref name=&quot;jn&quot;&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[Jurnalul Național]], ''[http://old.jurnalul.ro/articol.php?id=2790 Calendar 26 iulie 2005.Moment istoric] (Anniversaries on July 26, 2005. A historical moment)''&lt;/ref&gt; and began forming another army.
The Ottomans were unable to conquer any of the major Moldavian strongholds ([[Suceava]], [[Neamț Citadel|Neamț]], [[Hotin]])&lt;ref name=&quot;ir&quot;/&gt; and were constantly harassed by small scale Moldavians attacks. Soon they were also confronted with starvation, a situation made worse by an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]], and the Ottoman army returned to Ottoman lands. The threat of Stephen to Wallachia nevertheless ceased.

The [[League of Lezhe#Battles of the League of Lezha|Albanian resistance]] led by George Kastrioti [[Skanderbeg]] (''İskender Bey''), an Albanian noble and a former member of the Ottoman ruling elite, curbed the Ottoman expansion. Skanderbeg had united the [[Albanian Principalities]] in a fight against the Empire in the [[League of Lezhë]] in 1444. Mehmed II couldn't subjugate [[Albania]] while Skanderbeg was alive, even though he twice (1466 and 1467) led the Ottoman armies himself against [[Krujë]]. After Skanderbeg died in 1468, the Albanians couldn't find a leader to replace him, and Mehmed II eventually conquered Krujë and Albania in 1478.

In spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched with a large army against the Albanians and their leader, Skenderbeg, who had long resisted the Ottomans, and had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkel63&quot;/&gt; For the Albanians, the outbreak of the Ottoman–Venetian War offered a golden opportunity to reassert their independence; for the Venetians, the Albanians provided a useful cover to the Venetian coastal holdings of [[Durazzo]] and [[Shkodër|Scutari]]. The major result of this campaign was the construction of the fortress of [[Elbasan]], allegedly within just 25 days. This strategically sited fortress, at the lowlands near the end of the old ''[[Via Egnatia]]'', cut Albania effectively in half, isolating Skenderbeg's base in the northern highlands from the Venetian holdings in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkel64&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2006|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the Sultan's withdrawal Skanderbeg himself spent the winter in Italy, seeking aid. On his return in early 1467, his forces sallied from the highlands, defeated [[Ballaban Badera|Ballaban Pasha]], and lifted the [[Second Siege of Krujë|siege]] of the fortress of Croia ([[Krujë]]); they also attacked Elbasan but failed to capture it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crusades327&quot;&gt;Setton, Hazard &amp; Norman (1969), p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton278&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed II responded by marching again against Albania. He energetically pursued the attacks against the Albanian strongholds, while sending detachments to raid the Venetian possessions to keep them isolated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crusades327&quot;/&gt; The Ottomans [[Third Siege of Krujë|failed again]] to take Croia, and they failed to subjugate the country. However, the winter brought an outbreak of plague, which would recur annually and sap the strength of the local resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton283&quot; /&gt; Skanderbeg himself died of malaria in the Venetian stronghold of Lissus ([[Lezhë]]), ending the ability of Venice to use the Albanian lords for its own advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkel64&quot;/&gt; The Albanians were left to their own devices and were gradually subdued over the next decade.

After Skanderbeg died, Mehmed II personally led the [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)|siege of Shkodra in 1478-79]], of which early Ottoman chronicler [[Aşıkpaşazade]] (1400–81) wrote, &quot;All the conquests of Sultan Mehmed were fulfilled with the seizure of Shkodra.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pulaha, Selami. ''Lufta shqiptaro-turke në shekullin XV. Burime osmane''. Tirana: Universiteti Shtetëror i Tiranës, Instituti i Historisë dhe Gjuhësisë, 1968, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The Venetians and Shkodrans resisted the assaults and continued to hold the fortress until Venice ceded Shkodra to the Ottoman Empire in the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1479)|Treaty of Constantinople]] as a condition of ending the war.

==Conquest of Genoese Crimea and alliance with Crimean Khanate (1475)==
{{Main|Crimean Khanate}}
A number of [[Turkic peoples]], collectively known as the [[Crimean Tatars]], had been inhabiting the peninsula since the early [[Middle Ages]]. After the destruction of the [[Golden Horde]] by [[Timur]] earlier in the 15th century, the Crimean Tatars founded an independent [[Crimean Khanate]] under [[Hacı I Giray]], a descendant of [[Genghis Khan]].

The Crimean Tatars controlled the steppes that stretched from the [[Kuban]] to the [[Dniester River]], but they were unable to take control over the commercial [[Genoa|Genoese]] towns called [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)]], which had been under Genoese control since 1357. After the conquest of Constantinople, Genoese communications were disrupted, and when the Crimean Tatars asked for help from the Ottomans, they responded with an invasion of the Genoese towns, led by [[Gedik Ahmed Pasha]] in 1475, bringing [[Feodosiya|Kaffa]] and the other trading towns under their control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Subtelny&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title=Ukraine: A History | author=Subtelny, Orest | publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-8020-8390-0 | authorlink=Orest Subtelny }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} After the capture of the Genoese towns, the Ottoman Sultan held [[Meñli I Giray]] captive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanchepress.com/Soldier_Khan.php |title=Soldier Khan |publisher=Avalanchepress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; later releasing him in return for accepting Ottoman suzerainty over the Crimean Khans and allowing them to rule as [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|tributary princes of the Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Subtelny&quot;/&gt;{{rp|78}}&lt;ref name=&quot;blacksea-crimea/hist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/history1.html |title=History |accessdate=28 March 2007 |work=blacksea-crimea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Crimean Khans still had a large amount of autonomy from the Ottoman Empire, while the Ottomans directly controlled the southern coast.

== Expedition to Italy (1480) ==
{{main|Ottoman invasion of Otranto}}
[[File:Mehmed II (1432-1481).jpg|thumb|A [[bronze medal]] of Mehmed the Conqueror by [[Bertoldo di Giovanni]], 1480]]

An Ottoman army under [[Gedik Ahmed Pasha]] invaded [[Italy]] in 1480, capturing [[Otranto]]. Because of lack of food, Gedik Ahmed Pasha returned with most of his troops to [[Albania]], leaving a garrison of 800 infantry and 500 cavalry behind to defend Otranto in Italy. It was assumed he would return after the winter. Since it was only 28 years after [[Fall of Constantinople|the fall of Constantinople]], there was some fear that [[Rome]] would suffer the same fate. Plans were made for the Pope and citizens of Rome to evacuate the city. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] repeated his 1471 call for a [[crusade]]. Several Italian city-states, Hungary, and France responded positively to the appeal. The [[Republic of Venice]] did not, however, as it had signed an expensive peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1479.

In 1481 king [[Ferdinand I of Naples]] raised an army to be led by his son [[Alphonso II of Naples]]. A contingent of troops was provided by king [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary. The city was besieged starting 1 May 1481. After the death of Mehmed on 3 May, ensuing quarrels about his succession possibly prevented the Ottomans the sending reinforcements to Otranto. So the Turkish occupation of Otranto ended by negotiation with the Christian forces, permitting the Turks to withdraw to Albania, and Otranto was retaken by Papal forces in 1481.

==Repopulation of Constantinople (1453–1478)==

{{further|History of Istanbul}}
[[File:Fatih Camii 1888-1910 yılları.jpg|thumb|left|Historical photo of [[Fatih Mosque, Istanbul|Fatih Mosque]], built by order of Sultan Mehmed II in Constantinople, the first [[imperial mosque]] built in the city after the Ottoman conquest.]]

After conquering Constantinople, when Mehmed II finally entered the city through what is now known as the [[Topkapi Palace|Topkapi Gate]], he immediately rode his horse to the [[Hagia Sophia]], which he ordered to be protected. He ordered that an [[imam]] meet him there in order to chant the Muslim Creed: &quot;I testify that there is no [[god]] but [[God in Islam|God]]. I testify that [[Muhammad]] is the messenger of [[Allah]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. ''Istanbul and the Civilization if the Ottoman Empire''. 1, University of Oklahoma Press, 1963. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] cathedral was transformed into a Muslim [[mosque]] through a [[Waqf|charitable trust]], solidifying [[Islam]]ic rule in Constantinople.

Mehmed’s main concern with Constantinople had to do with rebuilding the city’s defenses and repopulation. Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inalcik, Halil 1969, p. 236&quot;&gt;Inalcik, Halil. &quot;The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City&quot;. ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 23, (1969): 229–249. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage the return of the Greeks and the Genoese who had fled from [[Galata]], the trading quarter of the city, he returned their houses and provided them with guarantees of safety. Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle in the City; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inalcik, Halil 1969, p. 236&quot;/&gt; From all over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city; these people were called &quot;Sürgün&quot; in Turkish ({{lang-gr|σουργούνιδες}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;mw28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Müller-Wiener|1977|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehmed restored the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate (6 January 1454) and established a Jewish grand rabbi and an Armenian patriarch in the city. In addition, he founded, and encouraged his viziers to found, a number of Muslim institutions and commercial installations in the main districts of Constantinople, such as the [[Rum Mehmed Pasha Mosque]] built by the Grand Vizier [[Rum Mehmed Pasha]]. From these nuclei, the metropolis developed rapidly. According to a survey carried out in 1478, there were then in Constantinople and neighbouring Galata 16,324 households and 3,927 shops, an estimated population of 80,000.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ottomans and the Balkans'': Fikret Adanır,Suraiya Faroqhi, page 358, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The population was about 60% Muslim, 20% Christian, and 10% Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Islamic Societies'', Ira M. Lapidus, page 272, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehmed's ambitious rebuilding program changed the city by the end of his reign into a thriving imperial capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated23&quot;/&gt; According to the contemporary Ottoman historian [[Neşri]], &quot;Sultan Mehmed created all of Istanbul&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated23&quot;/&gt; Fifty years later, Constantinople had again become the largest city in Europe.

Two centuries later, the well-known Ottoman itinerant [[Evliya Çelebi]] gave a list of groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of [[Istanbul]], such as [[Aksaray, Istanbul|Aksaray]] and [[Çarşamba, Istanbul|Çarşamba]], bear the names of the places of origin of their inhabitants.&lt;ref name=mw28/&gt; However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmet allowed the deported Greeks to come back to the city.&lt;ref name=mw28/&gt; This measure apparently had no great success, since French voyager [[Pierre Gilles]] writes in the middle of the 16th century that the Greek population of Constantinople was unable to name any of the ancient Byzantine churches that had been transformed in mosques or been abandoned. This shows that the population substitution had been total.&lt;ref name=ma99&gt;Mamboury (1953), p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration and culture ==
{{Main|Millet (Ottoman Empire)}}

[[File:Gennadios II and Mehmed II.jpg|thumb|200px|Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror with patriarch [[Gennadius II]] depicted on a 20th-century mosaic]]
Mehmed II introduced the word Politics into Arabic &quot;Siyasah&quot; from a book he published and claimed to be the collection of Politics doctrines of the Byzantine Caesars before him. He gathered Italian artists, [[humanism|humanists]] and Greek scholars at his court, allowed the [[Eastern Orthodox|Byzantine Church]] to continue functioning, ordered the patriarch [[Gennadius Scholarius|Gennadius]] to translate [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine into Turkish, and called [[Gentile Bellini]] from Venice to paint his portrait.
He collected in his palace a library which included works in Greek and Latin.
Mehmed invited Muslim scientists such as [[Ali Qushji]] and artists to his court in Constantinople, started a University, built mosques (for example, the [[Fatih Mosque]]), waterways, and Istanbul's [[Topkapı Palace]] and the [[Tiled Kiosk]].
Around the [[Fatih Mosque|grand mosque]] that he constructed, he erected [[Sahn-ı Seman Medrese|eight madrasas]], which, for nearly a century, kept their rank as the highest teaching institutions of the Islamic sciences in the empire.

Mehmed II allowed his subjects a considerable degree of religious freedom, provided they were obedient to his rule. After his conquest of Bosnia in 1463 he issued the [[Ahdname of Milodraž]] to the [[Bosnian Franciscans]], granting them freedom to move freely within the [[Empire]], offer worship in their churches and monasteries, and to practice their religion free from official and unofficial persecution, insult or disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/ahd.html |title=Croatia and Ottoman Empire, Ahdnama, Sultan Mehemt II |publisher=Croatianhistory.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightmillennium.org/2004_14th_issue/eihsanoglu_stevens.html |title=A Culture of Peaceful Coexistence: The Ottoman Turkish Example; by Prof. Dr. Ekmeleddin IHSANOGLU |publisher=Light Millennium |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His standing army was recruited from the ''[[Devshirme]]'', a group that took first-born Christian subjects at a young age and destined them for the sultan's court. The less able, but physically strong, were instead put into the army or the sultan's personal guard, the [[Janissaries]].

Within Constantinople, Mehmed established a ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'' or an autonomous religious community, and appointed the former Patriarch [[Gennadius Scholarius]] as religious leader for the Orthodox Christians&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance and Reformation'': James Patrick, page 170, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  of the city. His authority extended to all Ottoman Orthodox Christians, and this excluded the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] settlements in the suburbs, and excluded Muslim and [[Jewish]] settlers entirely. This method allowed for an indirect rule of the Christian Byzantines and allowed the occupants to feel relatively autonomous even as Mehmed II began the Turkish remodeling of the city, turning it into the Turkish capital, which it remained until the 1920s.

==Creating an imperial central government==
Mehmed the Conqueror consolidated power by building his imperial court, the divan, with officials who would be solely loyal to him and allow him greater autonomy and authority. Under previous sultans the divan had been filled with members of aristocratic families that sometimes had other interests and loyalties than that of the sultan. Mehmed the Conqueror transitioned the empire away from the [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]] mentality that emphasizes ancient traditions and ceremonies in governance&lt;ref name=&quot;Architectural History Foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Necipoğlu|first1=Gülru|title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapi Palace in  the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|date=1991|publisher=Architectural History Foundation|page=21|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved the empire towards a centralized bureaucracy largely made of officials of [[devşirme]] background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Architectural History Foundation&quot;/&gt;  Additionally, Mehmed the Conqueror took the step of converting the religious scholars who were part of the Ottoman [[madrasa]]s into salaried employees of the Ottoman bureaucracy who were loyal to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Architectural History Foundation&quot;/&gt; This centralization was possible and formalized through a [[Ottoman law|kanunname]], issued during 1477–1481, which for the first time listed the chief officials in the Ottoman government, their roles and responsibilities, salaries, protocol and punishments, as well as how they related to each other and the sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Necipoğlu|first1=Gülru|title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapi Palace in  the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|date=1991|publisher=Architectural History Foundation|page=16|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once Mehmed had created an Ottoman bureaucracy and transitioned the empire from a frontier society to a centralized government, he took care to appoint officials who would help him implement his agenda. His first grand vizier was Zaganos Pasha, who was of devşirme background as opposed to an aristocrat,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meḥemmed Ii&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=İnalcık|first1=Halil|title=Meḥemmed Ii|journal=Encyclopaedia of Islam|volume=Second Edition|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/mehemmed-ii-SIM_5111|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zaganos Pasha’s successor, Mahmud Pasha Angelović, was also of devşirme background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Babinger|first1=Franz|title=Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time|date=1978|publisher=Princeton UP|location=Princeton, NJ|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed was the first sultan who was able to codify and implement kanunname solely based on his own independent authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meḥemmed Ii&quot;/&gt; Additionally, Mehmed was able to later implement kanunname that went again previous tradition or precedent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Architectural History Foundation&quot;/&gt; This was monumental in an empire that was so steeped in tradition and could be slow to change or adapt. Having viziers and other officials who were loyal to Mehmed was an essential part of this government because he transferred more power to the viziers than previous sultans had. He delegated significant powers and functions of government to his viziers as part of his new policy of imperial seclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Necipoğlu|first1=Gülru|title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapi Palace in  the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|date=1991|publisher=Architectural History Foundation|page=15|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wall was built around the palace as an element of the more closed era, and unlike previous sultans Mehmed was no longer accessible to the public or even lower officials. His viziers directed the military and met foreign ambassadors, two essential parts of governing especially with his numerous military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Necipoğlu|first1=Gülru|title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapi Palace in  the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|date=1991|publisher=Architectural History Foundation|page=18|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family life ==
Mehmed II had five wives:

==Personality==
On his accession as conqueror of Constantinople, aged 21, Mehmed was reputed to be fluent in several languages, including [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Arab language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich 1995 413–416&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Runciman 1965 56&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Runciman|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Runciman|year=1965|title=The Fall of Constantinople: 1453|page=56|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn =0-521-39832-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sabah.com.tr/yazarlar/barlas/2006/05/30/fatih_19_yasinda_alti_dili_cok_iyi_biliyordu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fatih.bel.tr/en/content/2629/fatih-sultan-mehmet/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milliyet.com.tr/fatih-hakan-ve-roma-kayzeri/ilber-ortayli/pazar/yazardetay/03.06.2012/1548527/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Overcite|date=September 2016}}

At times, he assembled the [[Ulama]], or learned Muslim teachers, and caused them to discuss theological problems in his presence. During his reign, mathematics, astronomy, and Muslim theology reached their highest level among the Ottomans. Mehmed himself was a poet writing under the name &quot;Avni&quot; (the helper, the helpful one) and he left a divan (a collection of poems in the traditional style of classical Ottoman literature).

In 1481 Mehmed marched with the Ottoman army to a new campaign, but upon reaching [[Maltepe, Istanbul]] he became ill. After some days he died, on 3 May 1481, at the age of forty-nine, and was buried in his ''[[türbe]]'' in the cemetery within the [[Fatih Mosque, Istanbul|Fatih Mosque]] Complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://culturecityistanbul.blogspot.com/2009/10/fatih-sultan-mehmed-mausoleum.html culturecityistanbul.blogspot.com/2009/10/fatih-sultan-mehmed-mausoleum.html].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian Colin Heywood, &quot;there is substantial circumstantial evidence that Mehmed was poisoned, possibly at the behest of
his eldest son and successor, Bayezid.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heywood |first=Colin |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Mehmed II |date=2009 |page=368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news of Mehmed's death caused great rejoicing in Europe; church bells were rung and celebrations held. The news was proclaimed in Venice thus: &quot;La Grande Aquila è morta!&quot; ('The Great Eagle is dead!')&lt;ref&gt;''The Grand Turk'': John Freely, page 180, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Minorities and the destruction of the Ottoman Empire'', Salâhi Ramadan Sonyel, Page 14, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
After the Conquest of Constantinople, Mehmed founded many mosques and [[madrasah|religious schools]] in the city, such as the ''[[külliye]]'' of the [[Fatih Mosque]]. Mehmed II is recognized as the first Sultan to codify criminal and constitutional law, long before [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]; he thus established the classical image of the autocratic Ottoman sultan.

Mehmed's thirty-one year rule and numerous wars expanded the Ottoman Empire to include Constantinople, the Turkish kingdoms and territories of Asia Minor, [[Bosnia]], the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], and [[Albania]]. Mehmed left behind an imposing reputation in both the Islamic and Christian worlds. According to historian [[Franz Babinger]], Mehmed was regarded as a bloodthirsty tyrant by the Christian world and by a part of his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Babinger, ''Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time'', (ed. WC Hickman, translated from the original [[German language|German]] by R Manheim),  Princeton University Press, 1992, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed is the [[eponym]]ous subject of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini's]] 1820 opera, ''[[Maometto II]]''. Istanbul's [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] (completed 1988), which crosses the Bosporus Straits, is named after him, and his name and picture appeared on the Turkish 1000 [[Turkish lira|lira]] note from 1986 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;تاريخ الدولة العليّة العثمانية، تأليف: الأستاذ محمد فريد بك المحامي، تحقيق: الدكتور إحسان حقي، دار النفائس، الطبعة العاشرة: 1427 هـ - 2006 م، صفحة: 177-178 ISBN 9953-18-084-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey] {{webarchive |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5hFIaQq0J?url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=3 June 2009 }}.
