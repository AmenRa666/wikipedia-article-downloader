'''No. 84 Wing''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) transport [[Wing (air force unit)|wing]]. Coming under the control of [[Air Mobility Group RAAF|Air Mobility Group]] (AMG), it is headquartered at [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales. The wing comprises [[No. 34 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron]], operating [[Boeing Business Jet|Boeing 737]] and [[Bombardier Challenger 604]] [[Very Important Person|VIP]] jets;  [[No. 37 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron]], operating [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules]] medium transports; and a technical training unit, [[No. 285 Squadron RAAF|No. 285 Squadron]].

Formed in 1944 for [[Close air support|army co-operation]] duties in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II]], No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing operated a mix of aircraft including [[CAC Boomerang]]s, [[CAC Wirraway]]s, [[Taylorcraft Auster|Auster AOPs]] and [[Bristol Beaufort]]s, before disbanding in 1946. It was re-formed in 1991 as a tactical transport wing headquartered at [[RAAF Base Townsville]], Queensland, comprising [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;35]] and [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|38 Squadrons]] operating [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou]]s. By 1996, it had been augmented by [[No. 32 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;32 Squadron]], operating [[Hawker Siddeley HS&amp;nbsp;748]] trainer-transports.

In 1998, No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing was reorganised as a special transport wing, headquartered at Richmond. The Caribous were transferred to [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing]] and No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing took over responsibility for [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron]], operating [[Boeing 707]] [[Aerial refueling|tanker]]-transports, and No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron, operating VIP transports, in addition to controlling No.&amp;nbsp;32 Squadron. By mid-2006, No.&amp;nbsp;32 Squadron had converted to [[Beechcraft King Air|Beech King Air 350s]] and transferred to [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]], while No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing had assumed control of No.&amp;nbsp;285 Squadron and [[Air Movements Training and Development Unit RAAF|Air Movements Training and Development Unit]] (AMTDU). AMTDU was subsequently moved under the direct aegis of ALG, and No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron under No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing, following the retirement of the 707s. No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron, by then the RAAF's sole Hercules unit, was transferred from No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing to No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing in 2010. No.&amp;nbsp;35 Squadron, which had been merged with No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron in 2000, was re-formed under No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing in 2013 to operate [[Alenia C-27J Spartan]] tactical transport commencing in 2015; the squadron was detached from the wing in January 2014 but is scheduled to return as the Spartan becomes operational.

==History==

===Army cooperation formation===
{{stack|[[File:No. 5 Sqn Boomerang (AWM OG3258).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Boomerang of No.&amp;nbsp;5 Squadron on Bougainville|alt=Single-engined military monoplane with propeller spinning, on jungle airfield]]}}
The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) established two [[Close air support|army cooperation]] [[Wing (air force unit)|wings]] in the [[South West Pacific Theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Theatre]] late in World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=Odgers&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/19.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 318–327]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 440]&lt;/ref&gt; They were, as described by the [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|official history of the RAAF in the Pacific]], &quot;essentially non-offensive in character&quot;, responsible for reconnaissance, artillery spotting, supply drops to ground forces, spraying [[DDT]] to combat [[malaria]], and guiding close support aircraft to their objectives. The wing's aircraft could also carry out their own strikes on &quot;targets of opportunity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/18.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 317]&lt;/ref&gt;

No. 84 (Army Cooperation) Wing was formed on 11&amp;nbsp;September 1944 in [[Cairns]], Queensland.&lt;ref name=AirForce1999&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Air Force News |volume=41 |issue=9|date= October 1999|page=18|title=Bulletin board}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commanded by Group Captain [[William Hely|Bill Hely]], it comprised [[No. 5 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 (Tactical Reconnaissance) Squadron]], [[No. 17 Air Observation Post Flight RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;17 Air Observation Post (AOP) Flight]], No.&amp;nbsp;10 Communication Unit, and No.&amp;nbsp;39 Operational Base Unit.&lt;ref name=Odgers/&gt; The wing arrived at [[Torokina]] in October to begin supporting Australian troops during the [[Bougainville Campaign]].&lt;ref name=Parnell&gt;Parnell; Lynch, ''Australian Air Force Since 1911'', p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;5 Squadron, equipped with eighteen [[CAC Boomerang]]s and four [[CAC Wirraway]]s, was assigned to mark targets for [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsairs]] of the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]]. The [[Taylorcraft Auster|Austers]] of No.&amp;nbsp;17 AOP Flight were used for reconnaissance and courier work, becoming, in the words of the official history, &quot;the eyes of the battalion commanders&quot;.&lt;ref name=Odgers/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;10 Communications Unit flew [[Avro Anson]]s and [[Bristol Beaufort]]s on courier, reconnaissance, supply, and anti-malarial spraying missions; it was renamed [[No. 10 Local Air Supply Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;10 Local Air Supply Unit]] in March 1945.&lt;ref name=LASU&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 145–147&lt;/ref&gt; Between December 1944 and January 1945, the wing lost one Auster, one Wirraway, and one Boomerang on operations.&lt;ref name=Parnell/&gt;

[[File:No. 17 AOP Flight Auster (AWM 107054).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Auster of No.&amp;nbsp;17 AOP Flight over Bougainville|alt=Single-engined high-wing light plane flying over water, with jungle terrain in background]]
Despite suffering shortages of pilots and equipment, No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing was generally able to keep pace with the army's requirements.&lt;ref name=Odgers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 389–390&lt;/ref&gt; A detachment of [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron]], flying [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakotas]], was employed to augment the wing's supply capabilities. Up until the end of June 1945, No.&amp;nbsp;5 Squadron had flown almost 2,000 [[sortie]]s and No.&amp;nbsp;17 AOP Flight over 1,300, while No.&amp;nbsp;10 Local Air Supply Unit and the No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron detachment had accounted for almost 1,000 between them. As the navigational efficiency of the New Zealander pilots increased, demands on the Boomerangs and Wirraways lessened, and the bulk of the reconnaissance duties fell to the Austers of No.&amp;nbsp;17 AOP Flight.&lt;ref name=Odgers/&gt;

When the Pacific War ended in August 1945, No.&amp;nbsp;10 Local Air Supply Unit was tasked with dropping leaflets announcing the news over Japanese positions.&lt;ref name=LASU/&gt; That month, Group Captain D.R. Chapman succeeded Hely as No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing's commander. The end of hostilities led to morale problems owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation; Chapman sent [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|Northern Command]] headquarters a frank report to this effect, its tone earning him a rebuke from the [[Air Officer Commanding]], Air Commodore [[Allan Walters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=No. 84 (Army Co-operation) Wing|title=Operations record book |url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=1753386| pages=21–23, 31|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;17 AOP Flight was disbanded on Bougainville in December, followed a month later by No.&amp;nbsp;10 Local Air Supply Unit.&lt;ref name=LASU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;5 Squadron transferred to [[RAAF Base Pearce|RAAF Station Pearce]], Western Australia, in January 1946, and disbanded in October that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11027second_world_war.asp|title =No 5 Squadron RAAF|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing headquarters completed &quot;reduction to nucleus&quot; at Bougainville on 29&amp;nbsp;January 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Royal Australian Air Force|title=No. 84 (Army Co-operation) Wing accounting inspection |url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=1697620| page= 4|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It departed Torakina and arrived in [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], Victoria, on 28&amp;nbsp;February, disbanding there on 6&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref&gt;AWM, ''Squadrons, Formations &amp; Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

No. 84 Wing was re-established as a tactical transport wing under the newly formed [[Combat Support Group RAAF|Operational Support Group]] (OSG) at [[RAAF Base Townsville]], Queensland, in February 1991.&lt;ref name=AirForce1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bases&gt;RAAF Historical section, ''Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations'', p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised two squadrons of [[de Havilland DHC-4 Caribou]]s: [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;35 Squadron]], located at Townsville, and [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron]], located at [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=RAAF1992&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=RAAF News |volume=34 |issue=1|date=February 1992|page=15|title=Aircraft of the RAAF: A4&amp;nbsp;– DHC Caribou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the two squadrons had been under the control of Tactical Transport Group, OSG's predecessor at Townsville.&lt;ref name=Bases/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing's primary purpose was to support [[Australian Army]] operations and exercises, as well as the [[Parachute Training School (Australian Army)|Parachute Training School]] at [[HMAS Albatross (air station)|HMAS Albatross]] in [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]], New South Wales. It also maintained detachments for search-and-rescue and local transport duties at [[RAAF Base Darwin]], Northern Territory, and RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia.&lt;ref name=RAAF1992/&gt; The Pearce detachment (No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron Detachment&amp;nbsp;A) was formed from [[No. 2 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Flying Training School]]'s Caribou Flight on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=RAAF News |volume=34 |issue=1|date=February 1992|page=21|title=Special tour for Caribou}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their military role, the Caribous provided assistance to the civil community in the form of disaster relief and medical evacuation.&lt;ref name=Today1&gt;{{cite magazine|title=From Tiger Moths to tactical transport|magazine=Air Force Today |volume=1 |issue=1|date=May 1996|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft frequently operated in Papua New Guinea, for training and humanitarian missions.&lt;ref&gt;McPhedran, ''Air Force'', pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;  No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron, responsible for all Caribou aircrew conversion and operations training, transferred to [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland, in October 1992.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 48, 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Today2&gt;{{cite magazine|title=TAC airlift|magazine=Air Force Today |volume=1 |issue=2|date =July 1996|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning the following month, seven of the fleet's twenty-one Caribous were retired to storage at Amberley for use as spare parts.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/35sqn.htm |title= No 35 Squadron |publisher=[[RAAF Museum]] |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1996, No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing was under the control of [[Air Lift Group RAAF|Air Lift Group]] (ALG), located at Richmond, and had been augmented by [[No. 32 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;32 Squadron]], operating [[Hawker Siddeley HS&amp;nbsp;748]]s for navigational training, [[Very Important Person|VIP]] transport, and fisheries surveillance out of [[RAAF Base East Sale]] in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=32 Squadron multi-role|magazine=Air Force Today |volume=1 |issue=1|date=May 1996|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air Force Australia'', pp. 192–193, 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1998, No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing was reorganised as a special transport wing under ALG, &quot;special transport&quot; meaning activities not directly related to army support, such as carrying VIPs.&lt;ref name=AirForce1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, '' Air Force Australia'', p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters was relocated to Richmond. In addition to No.&amp;nbsp;32 Squadron, its complement included [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron]], operating [[Boeing 707]]s for [[Aerial refueling|air-to-air refuelling]] and VIP transport out of Richmond, and No.&amp;nbsp;34 Squadron, operating [[Falcon 900]]s for VIP transport out of [[Fairbairn, Canberra|RAAF Base Fairbairn]] in Canberra.
