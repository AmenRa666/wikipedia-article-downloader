The '''Leticia Incident''', also called the '''Leticia War''' or the '''Colombia–Peru War''' (1 September 1932 – 24 May 1933), was a short-lived [[armed conflict]] between the [[Republic of Colombia]] and the [[Republic of Peru]] over territory in the [[Amazon Rainforest]].

==Civilian takeover==
The Colombia–Peru War of 1932-3 was the result of dissatisfaction with the [[Salomón-Lozano Treaty]] and the imposition of heavy tariffs on sugar. The war started with an internal insurrection in Peru, a civilian takeover of the city [[Iquitos]]. On September 1, 1932 President [[Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro|Luis Miguel Sánchez]] dispatched two regiments of the [[Peruvian Army]] to [[Leticia, Colombia|Leticia]] and [[Tarapacá, Amazonas|Tarapacá]], both settlements located in the [[Amazonas Department]] in present-day southern [[Colombia]]. These actions were mostly ignored by the [[Politics of Colombia|Colombian Government]] at the time.

==Colombian patriotism==
It was not until September 17 of that same year that the [[Politics of Colombia|Colombian Government]] took notice. The Peruvian Military Forces which were encroached upon the banks of the [[Putumayo River]] stopped several large trade ships from traveling to Leticia. The result of this was an explosion of Colombian [[patriotism]]. [[Laureano Gómez]] head of the Senate minority proclaimed, &quot;Peace, peace, peace in inner Colombia; War, war, war on the border against our despicable enemy.&quot;

On September 19, ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'' reported that they had received over 10,000 letters calling for war and control of [[Leticia, Colombia|Leticia]]. That same day thousands of Colombian students marched through the streets of [[Bogotá]] chanting, &quot;[[Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro|Sánchez Cerro]] will die and [[Colombia]] will defy!&quot; [[Vásquez Cobo]] was declared general of the Colombian Amazonian Navy and 10 million dollars were approved by the Senate to fund his venture. Over 400 kilos of gold were donated by the Colombian cities as a symbol of gratitude to [[Huila Department|Huilan]] engineer, [[César García Álvarez]].

[[Image:Tarapaca Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''War Memorial''' in [[Tarapacá, Amazonas|Tarapacá]], [[Colombia]]. Plaque reads,''&quot;To the Heroes of the [[Colombian Air Force]]; who with true courage gave the best of themselves; flying with their noble aircraft over river and jungle. Declaring over our Amazonia with the sound of their motors the sovereignty of our country during the war with [[Peru]].&quot;'']]

==The war==
President [[Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro|Sánchez]] believed Colombia had no chance of defending itself: lacking roads and a proper Navy, the Amazon region had no Colombian military presence. It was not until December 1932 that General [[Alfredo Vásquez Cobo]] reached the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] with a fleet of old ships he acquired in Europe. Within 90 days Colombia organized a respectable military response to the Peruvian invasion. [[Herbert Boy]] and the other German Aviators of [[SCADTA]] (later to become [[Avianca]]) fitted their commercial planes for war as a temporary [[Colombian Air Force]]. The first attack by the [[Colombian Navy]] was upon [[Tarapacá, Amazonas|Tarapacá]]. The city had been chosen because [[Leticia, Colombia|Leticia]] was on the border with [[Brazil]] and the Colombian Forces feared to attack the well-defended Peruvian position in that city.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The recuperation of Tarapacá was a bloodless event since no Peruvian troops were present in that town. The day before, February 14, 1933, the [[Peruvian Air Force]] had attempted to bomb the Colombian Fleet,  but most of the bombs had hit off target.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leticia Air War p6&quot;&gt;von Rauch 1984, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The Peruvian forces in Leticia could not be forced to withdraw but the events in Lima, and the assassination of the Peruvian president, changed the situation and the new Peruvian president ordered undefeated Peruvian troops to leave Leticia. Part of Peru's Pacific fleet were coming through the Amazon River to engage in combat.

==Rio de Janeiro Protocol==
On the same day, the Colombian president [[Enrique Olaya Herrera|Enrique Olaya]] broke off all relations with the Peruvian government due to the aerial attack. He ordered an attack on Leticia but it was repelled by Peruvian troops. 

On April 30, 1933, President [[Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro|Sánchez]] was shot dead. 15 days later, his successor, [[Óscar Benavides]], met with the head of the [[Colombian Liberal Party]], [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]], to secure an agreement to turn Leticia over to a [[League of Nations]] commission.

[[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] met in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] to sign a peace treaty. In the [[Rio de Janeiro Protocol]], Peru stated that, &quot;We sincerely deplore the events that occurred starting September, 1932. Specifically those that damaged our relationship with Colombia.&quot; The [[Salomón-Lozano Treaty]] was also reaffirmed by the treaty.
