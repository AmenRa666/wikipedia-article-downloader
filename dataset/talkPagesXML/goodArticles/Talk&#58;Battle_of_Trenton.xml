==Semi-protect==
Is there any consensus on Semi-Protecting the page?  The vandalism seems to come exclusively from anonymous IP addresses (which seem to be from computers in schools).  Semi-Protect would require an account to edit, right?  &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User:Valtam|Valtam]]&lt;/font&gt; 14:53, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:I have no idea what you have written but I believe this talk page is not a forum and Wikipedia doesn't need to know who or whatever fought in the American Revolutionary war. If I'm guessing, you're trying to write: Washington and his troops won (mi?) I know my great, great, great grandpa fought (could be possibly got?) in it. But evidently, you did this on purpose and I'm sure you think it's funny but it's not. I'm suggesting I should revert this edit, but I'm not going to revert this &quot;edit&quot;. I hope user and other non-users (including you) understand what I'm saying.[[User:Crab rangoons|Allied Rangoons]] ([[User talk:Crab rangoons|talk]]) 22:57, 10 April 2014 (UTC)
::It's nearly pointless, and probably a total waste of time to respond to messages from several years ago. Those who left them are unlikely to be watching for a response, or to care.  They are stale and should have been archived long ago. [[User:Hertz1888|Hertz1888]] ([[User talk:Hertz1888|talk]]) 23:18, 10 April 2014 (UTC)
:::It's good to see or I mean, well you know. But surprisingly a user wrote a question on Battle of Bunker Hill's talk page and it was written 4 years and 5 months ago and I answered and he answered me instantly.[[User:Crab rangoons|Allied Rangoons]] ([[User talk:Crab rangoons|talk]]) 23:33, 10 April 2014 (UTC)
::::That's unusual, and he answered with sarcasm you may have missed. The one who posed the original question did not respond.  It was a dead issue long ago. [[User:Hertz1888|Hertz1888]] ([[User talk:Hertz1888|talk]]) 00:05, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::No, I have my [[Talk:Battle_of_Bunker_Hill#Dr._Joseph_Warren_killed|evidence]]. I calculated the year between the time he wrote the question and he replied to me. He wrote the question on 2009 and now is 2014.[[User:Crab rangoons|Allied Rangoons]] ([[User talk:Crab rangoons|talk]]) 00:13, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
::::::It's your time to spend as you wish. I was trying to suggest you might look for more constructive ways to spend it. Let's ''not'' prolong this discussion. [[User:Hertz1888|Hertz1888]] ([[User talk:Hertz1888|talk]]) 00:20, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::::Well, I am using my time wisely. Our class this quarter is learning about the American Revolution which I have plentiful information and facts. I was searching up facts so while I'm studying, I also answer other people's question. A question could be written back when Wikipedia just started but I'd answer it anyway as long as I'm ''still'' contributing to Wikipedia. Thanks for trying to help me though.

== Contradiction ==

The introduction to this article states that the Hessians did not post a dawn sentry, were caught by surprise, and then captured before they could resist.  Yet the main article recounts that the Hessian outposts detected the American advance and warned the main body of the army, so that the Hessians were wide awake and getting ready when the Americans arrived.  A short but furious battle in the streets followed, and it was a miracle that the Americans suffered so few casualties.  Should I alter the introduction so that it agrees with the main text?  Richard M. Ketchums excellent book on the campaign, &quot;The Winter Soldiers&quot;, agrees with the main body of the article that the Hessians were not surprised in their beds and put up a hard fight before surrendering.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.178.60.119|70.178.60.119]] ([[User talk:70.178.60.119|talk]]) 17:24, 14 December 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Hesse-Kassel as a belligerent ==

Are we certain it is correct to list the state of Hesse-Kassel as a belligerent in this battle? The Hessian soldiers were from Hesse, yes, but they were not serving under the command or authority of the government of Hesse-Kassel. They were mercenaries hired by the British - part of the British armies and under British command and authority.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.174.163.104|70.174.163.104]] ([[User talk:70.174.163.104|talk]]) 03:27, 25 December 2014 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
