The '''M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage'''  (MGMC), otherwise known as the M13 Half-track, was a [[self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|self-propelled anti-aircraft gun]] used by the U.S. Army during World War II that was armed with two .50 caliber [[M2 Browning|M2HB heavy-barrel]] Browning machine guns. Developed in response to a requirement for a mobile anti-aircraft (AA) vehicle, the vehicle was produced by the [[White Motor Company]] between July 1942 and May 1943. The only time it was ever used in combat was when the Americans [[Battle of Anzio|landed at Anzio]] in January 1944. It was replaced by the more heavily armed [[M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage]] in April 1944.

The M13 evolved from a series of several unsuccessful prototypes that were trialed from 1940 to 1942. Of these, the T1E4 was selected and given the official name of the M13 MGMC, before being placed into production. Half of the M13s produced were converted into M16s on the production lines.

== Specifications ==
The M13 Half-track was {{convert|21|ft|4|in|m}} long, {{convert|7|ft|1|in|m}} wide,&lt;ref name=Ness206&gt;Ness (2002), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|7|ft|8|in|m}} high with a wheelbase of {{convert|135.5|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=Berndt152&gt;Berndt (1993) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; It had [[bogie]] suspension for the wheels and [[Vertical volute spring suspension|vertical volute springs]] for the tracks. It had a 60&amp;nbsp;US gallon (230&amp;nbsp;l) fuel capacity and a range of {{convert|175|mi|km}}. The vehicle was powered by a six-cylinder White 160AX, 128&amp;nbsp;horsepower (95&amp;nbsp;kW), 386&amp;nbsp;cubic inches (6,330&amp;nbsp;cc) [[gasoline engine]], with a compression ratio of 6.3:1. It had a power-to-weight ratio of 15.8&amp;nbsp;horsepower per ton and weighed nine tons.&lt;ref name=Berndt152 /&gt; The armor across most of the vehicle was {{convert|0.25|in|mm}} thick with a {{convert|0.5|in|mm}} thick windscreen visor. The vehicle was armed with two 0.5&amp;nbsp;inch [[M2 Browning]] heavy machine guns placed on an [[M45 Quadmount#History|M33 Maxson mount]].&lt;ref name=Ness206 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berndt34&gt;Berndt (1994), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rottman38&gt;Rottman (2012), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The two machine guns were fired remotely and powered by a small electrical motor near the back of the turret. The guns were aimed with a Mark 9 [[reflector sight]]. Each vehicle had a crew of five (commander, driver, gunner, and two ammunition loaders).&lt;ref&gt;Hogg &amp; Weeks (1980), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:M16-halftrack-korea.jpg|thumb|The [[M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage]], the successor to the M13.|alt=A M16 MGMC on a ridge during the [[Korean War]].]]

=== Early experiments ===
In October 1940, development began to produce a vehicle in response to a long-standing requirement for an anti-aircraft vehicle to protect the U.S. Army's mechanized [[convoy#Road convoys|troop convoys]] from aerial attack.&lt;ref name=Zaloga38 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torriami &amp; Dennis (2014), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The first vehicle produced in the development of a half track with an anti-aircraft armament was the T1, which had two M2 machine guns on a [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] machine gun mount{{mdash}}as used on jeeps{{mdash}}on a 4×4 truck. The T1E1 had a power-operated Bendix mount, and the T1E2 a Maxson mount. The T1E3 had an electro-dynamic [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] aircraft-type turret. Evaluation of these test vehicles led to the T1E2 design being preferred. The T1E2 became the M16 Half-track by replacing the M33 with the M45 mount and the M2 Half-track chassis with the M3 Half-track chassis.&lt;ref name=Zaloga38&gt;Zaloga (1994) p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Berndt32&gt;Berndt (1994), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green150&gt;Green &amp; Green (2000), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt130&gt;Hunnicutt (2001), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chamberlain191 /&gt;

=== T1E4 and M13 ===
The next stage of development was to use the T1E2 configuration on the longer [[chassis]] of the M3 Half-track, since it could store more ammunition. This vehicle, originally designated as the T1E4, was accepted into production as the M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage on 27 July 1942.&lt;ref name=Zaloga38 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt130 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chamberlain191&gt;Chamberlain &amp; Ellis (1969) p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 1,103 examples of this variant were produced from 27 July 1942 to 15 May 1943. Half of them (583) were converted into M16s by the [[White Motor Company]] before reaching the army. Deliveries began in late 1943.&lt;ref name=Zaloga38 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berndt32 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Green150 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt130 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Doyle394&gt;Doyle (2011), p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service history ==
The M13 served at the [[Battle of Anzio|landing at Anzio]] with the [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] of the [[Fifth United States Army]] in January 1944. It was used as an anti-aircraft weapon during the initial landing and then later as a ground support weapon to repel heavy German [[tank|''panzer'']] attacks on the beachhead. It was replaced three months later by the M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage in April 1944.&lt;ref name=Zaloga38 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berndt32 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga (2013), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunnicutt (1992), p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 139 examples were deployed overseas by the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name=Green287&gt;Green (2014), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foss (1987), p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten were transferred to the [[United Kingdom]] under [[Lend-Lease]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/LL-Ship/LL-Ship-3A.html Quantities of Lend-Lease Shipments (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prototypes ==
[[File:M13 MGMC.jpg|thumb|left|The M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage.|alt=A sketch of the side view of the M13 MGMC.]]
* T1 – This variant used two M2 Browning heavy machine guns on a Bendix mount on a 4×4 truck. This model, like most of the others, was a prototype.&lt;ref name=Zaloga38 /&gt; It was tested in June–July 1941 at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]s, but was rejected because of the &quot;excessive dispersion of ammunition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hunnicutt (2001), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;
* T1E1 – Another prototype that used the Bendix mount on a [[M2 Half Track Car|M2 Half-track Car]].&lt;ref name=Zaloga38 /&gt; It was cancelled in April 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Hunnicutt (2001), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;
* T1E2 – This variant was essentially the same as the T1E1 except the Bendix mount was replaced with the M33 Maxson mount. After the M33 was replaced with the M45 Quadmount it was accepted as the M16 Half-track.&lt;ref name=Zaloga38 /&gt;
* T1E3 – A T1E1 with a [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] turret designed for use on [[bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=Zaloga38 /&gt;

== Derivatives ==
* T1E4/M13 – The Martin turret was replaced by the M33 and was based on the M3 Half-track. It was accepted as the M13 Half-track in July 1942. A total of 139 examples of this variant saw action at Anzio as a ground support weapon used to repel heavy German attacks. It was replaced by the M16 in April 1944.&lt;ref name=Zaloga38 /&gt;
* M14 Half-track – This variant had the same armament as the M13 but used the slightly different [[M5 Half-track]] chassis built by International Harvester for the Lend-Lease Program. The M14 was mostly supplied to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], where they were converted back to regular half-tracks. A total of 1602 were produced by [[International Harvester]].&lt;ref name=Zaloga38 /&gt;
