'''Johannes Wiese''' (7 March 1915&amp;nbsp;– 16 August 1991) was a German [[Luftwaffe]] pilot during World War II, credited with 133 enemy aircraft shot down in 480 combat missions. He claimed all of his victories over the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], including over 50 [[Ilyushin Il-2]] Shturmovik [[ground attack]] aircraft.

Born in [[Breslau]], Wiese volunteered for military service in the armed forces of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1934. Initially serving in the ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (Army), he transferred to the Luftwaffe (Air Force) in 1936. Following flight training, he was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 52|''Jagdgeschwader'' 52]] (JG&amp;nbsp;52—52nd Fighter Wing) in June 1941 just prior to [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the Soviet Union. He claimed his first aerial victory in September 1941.

In June 1942, Wiese was appointed squadron leader within the unit and received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] in January 1943 following his 53rd aerial victory. In 1943, Wiese was appointed commander on an air group of JG&amp;nbsp;52. Following his 133rd aerial victory, he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] in March 1944. In October 1944, Wiese was posted to the headquarters unit of [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG&amp;nbsp;77—77th Fighter Wing) in [[Defense of the Reich]] and in  January 1944, he was appointed its wing commander.

After the war in 1956 he joined the [[Bundeswehr]] and worked for the [[Military History Research Office (Germany)|Military History Research Office]]. He retired in 1970 holding the rank of [[Oberstleutnant]] (Lieutenant Colonel). Wiese died in 1991; he was buried in [[Berlin-Nikolassee]].

==Early life and career==
Wiese was born on 7 March 1915 in [[Breslau]] in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] of the [[German Empire]], present-day Wrocław in western Poland, the son of a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]. In 1934, Wiese volunteered for service in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Heer'']] (German Army) and joined ''Infanterie-Regiment'' 6 (6th Infantry Regiment).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p35&quot;&gt;Stockert 2007, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Wiese transferred to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' as an ''[[Oberfähnrich]]'' (Officer candidate). There, he was trained as an [[aerial observer]] with the ''Heeresaufklärer'' (Army [[Reconnaissance]]). Wiese was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (second lieutenant) on 1 April 1937 and in September 1938 transferred to the ''Fliegerersatzabteilung'' 17 (17th Flier Replacement Unit) in [[Quedlinburg]]. He then volunteered for the ''[[Jagdwaffe]]'' (fighter force) and holding the rank of ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (first lieutenant) he began [[fighter pilot]] training in October 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p35&quot;/&gt;{{refn|Flight training in the ''Luftwaffe'' progressed through the levels A1, A2 and B1, B2, referred to as A/B flight training. A training included theoretical and practical training in aerobatics, navigation, long-distance flights and dead-stick landings. The B courses included high-altitude flights, instrument flights, night landings and training to handle the aircraft in difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Note&quot;}}

==World War II==

===Eastern Front===
Wiese was posted to a front-line unit in June 1941, almost two years after the start of World War II. His unit was the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Geschwaderstab]]'' (headquarters unit) of [[Jagdgeschwader 52|''Jagdgeschwader'' 52]] (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing) where he served as an [[adjutant]].&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)|Organization of the ''Luftwaffe'' during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June, the ''Geschwader'' crossed into Soviet airspace in support of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the Soviet Union, which opened the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. He claimed his first aerial victory on 23 September 1941 and was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class on 27 September 1941 and the [[Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe]] in Silver on 11 October 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p35&quot; /&gt;

Wiese received the Iron Cross 1st Class on 1 May 1942. Following his 7th aerial victory he was appointed ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of the 2. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (2nd squadron) of JG&amp;nbsp;52 on 26 June 1942 and received the Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe in Gold on 13 July 1942. On 29 September 1942, Wiese he claimed his 25th aerial victory. On 25 October 1942, he became an &quot;[[Aviators who became ace in a day|ace-in-a-day]]&quot; for the first time, claiming victories 29 to 33. Wiese was awarded the [[Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe|Honor Goblet of the ''Luftwaffe'']] on 6 November 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p35&quot; /&gt;

He became an &quot;ace-in-a-day&quot; again on 16 December 1942, which took his total to 43. On 25 December, Wiese claimed his 50th aerial victory. He was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 5 January 1943 following his 53rd aerial victory. The presentation was made by ''[[General der Flieger]]'' (General of the Flyers) [[Günther Korten]] in [[Rossosh, Rossoshansky District, Voronezh Oblast|Rossosh]] on the Eastern Front.&lt;ref&gt;Stockert 2007, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources contradict themselves on the exact date of the presentation of the [[German Cross]] in Gold. According to Thomas, Patzwall and Scherzer, the presentation was made on 5 December 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas p443&quot;&gt;Thomas 1998, p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patzwall &amp; Scherzer p512&quot;&gt;Patzwall &amp; Scherzer 2001, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Obermaier and Stockert, the presentation occurred on 8 February 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier p62&quot;&gt;Obermaier 1989, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p37&quot;&gt;Stockert 2007, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wiese and others at the Obersalzberg.jpg|thumb|left|from left to right: Wiese, Otte, Seiler, Ademeit, Krupinski, Hartmann, Petersen, Hitler and Von Below at the award ceremony]]
Following a lengthy home leave, Wiese was tasked with the leadership of I. ''[[Luftwaffe Organization#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (1st group) of JG&amp;nbsp;52 on 11 May 1943. On 13 November 1943, he was officially appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of I. ''Gruppe'' and at the end of 1943, Wiese was promoted to ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (major).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p37&quot;/&gt; His most successful day was 5 July 1943, the first day of the [[Battle of Kursk]], when he shot down twelve enemy aircraft in one mission, a double &quot;ace-in-a-day&quot; achievement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaulen&quot;&gt;Schaulen 2005, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2004, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; All 12 victories were over [[Ilyushin Il-2]] Stormoviks [[ground attack]] aircraft and took his total to 95 victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p37&quot;/&gt; On 17 July 1943, Wiese was credited with his 100th aerial victory. He was the 45th ''Luftwaffe'' pilot to achieve the century mark.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier 1989, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his 133rd aerial victory and his last, Wiese was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] on 2 March 1944, the 418th officer or soldier of the Wehrmacht so honored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p37&quot;/&gt; Wiese and fellow JG&amp;nbsp;52 pilots [[Erich Hartmann]], [[Walter Krupinski]], and [[Gerhard Barkhorn]] travelled on an overnight train from in Berlin to the [[Führer Headquarters]] at the [[Berghof (Hitler)|''Berghof'']] in [[Berchtesgaden]] for the award ceremony by [[Adolf Hitler]] on 4 April 1944. They got drunk on the train and arrived at Berchtesgaden intoxicated. Major [[Nicolaus von Below]], Hitler's Luftwaffe adjutant, was shocked.&lt;ref&gt;Braatz 2010, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 1944, Wiese was severely injured in combat. Following his convalescence, he was posted to the ''Verbandsführerschule'' (Training School for Unit Leaders) of the ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'' (General of Fighters) at [[Chojna|Königsberg in der Neumark]], present-day Chojna in western Poland, on 11 June 1944. This ended his service on the Eastern Front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p37&quot;/&gt;

===Wing commander===
On 19 June 1944, Wiese participated in comparison test flights at the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s main testing ground for new aircraft designs at [[Rechlin]]. On that day, the ''Luftwaffe'' tested and compared the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]&amp;nbsp;G-6, a Bf&amp;nbsp;109&amp;nbsp;G-6/AS, a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]&amp;nbsp;A-8 against a [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] and a [[P-51 Mustang]].&lt;ref&gt;Creek &amp; Petrick 2003, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geschwaderwappen Jagdgeschwader 77.png|thumb|right|''Herzas'' (Ace of Hearts) emblem of JG 77|alt=red heart in black square]]
In October 1944, Wiese was posted to the ''Geschwaderstab'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG 77—77th Fighter Wing) in [[Defense of the Reich]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. On 7 November 1944, he was appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander) of JG&amp;nbsp;77, replacing ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' (Lieutenant Colonel) [[Johannes Steinhoff]], who was given command of [[Jagdgeschwader 7|''Jagdgeschwader'' 7]] &quot;Nowotny&quot; (JG 7—7th Fighter Wing), the first operational jet fighter wing in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p38&quot;&gt;Stockert 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prien 1995, p. 2191.&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, command was handed over on 1 December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Prien 1995, p. 2370.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 1944, the [[Wehrmacht]] launched its last major [[military offensive|offensive]] [[military campaign|campaign]] of the war. The operation codenamed ''Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein'', or [[Battle of the Bulge]] (16 December 1944&amp;nbsp;– 25 January 1945), which failed to achieve its objectives, intended to split the British and American [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] line in half, so the Germans could then proceed to [[encirclement|encircle and destroy]] four Allied armies, forcing the [[Western Allies]] to negotiate a [[peace treaty]] in the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis Powers]]' favor.&lt;ref&gt;Prien 1995, pp. 2208–2209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiese led JG&amp;nbsp;77 in the opening phase of the offensive until 25 December 1944, when he was severely injured in a training exercise. Wiese and his wingman, ''[[Feldwebel]]'' (Sergeant) Hansch, took off at 11:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. on a training flight over German held territory. The plan was to meet up with I. ''Gruppe'' but the two failed to establish contact. Instead, flying at an altitude of {{Convert|8700|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, they encountered a flight of [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s in the vicinity of [[Bottrop]] and [[Essen]]. In the resulting aerial combat, both Bf&amp;nbsp;109&amp;nbsp;G-14s were shot down, Hansch was [[killed in action]] while Wiese [[Parachute|bailed out]]. He came down near Essen-Dellwig. His parachute only opened partially, resulting in a harsh landing, and loss of consciousness. Wiese was taken to a field hospital at Bottrop where he was diagnosed with a [[concussion]] and minor [[skull fracture]]. He spent the rest of the winter in hospital, and was replaced as commander by ''Major'' [[Siegfried Freytag]].&lt;ref&gt;Prien 1995, pp. 2232–2233.&lt;/ref&gt; Their victors may have been Spitfires from the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) [[No. 401 Squadron RCAF|No. 401 Squadron]] which claimed two Bf&amp;nbsp;109s from the ''Stab'' of JG&amp;nbsp;77 shot down over [[Duisburg]] that day. One of these victories was credited to [[Flying Officer]] John MacKay.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2014, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiese surrendered to U.S. forces at the end of the war and was handed over by the Americans to the Soviet [[Red Army]] on 6 September 1945. Wiese spent over four years in Soviet [[prisoner of war]] camps and was released on 28 November 1949. He was officially credited with 133 victories claimed in 480 combat missions. Additionally, he had 25 more unconfirmed claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaulen&quot;/&gt; Among his claims are over 50 Il-2 Stormoviks. Soviet fighter pilots therefore greatly respected Wiese, and referred to him as the &quot;Lion of [[Kuban]]&quot;, a name he earned during combat over the [[Kuban bridgehead]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p38&quot;/&gt;

==Later life==
After the war in 1956, Wiese joined the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'', the [[armed forces]] of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], and worked for the [[Military History Research Office (Germany)|Military History Research Office]]. He retired on 10 November 1970 holding the rank of ''Oberstleutnant''. Wiese died on 16 August 1991 in [[Kirchzarten]] and was buried in [[Berlin-Nikolassee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p38&quot;/&gt;
