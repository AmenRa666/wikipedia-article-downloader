== Some definitions ==

History my friends, is not a past event as many of you out there think; history is the interpretation of that event.  That is, an event happens and nobody knows about it, that then is not history; it becomes history when somebody writes about it or speaks about it.  It is a big misunderstanding to think of history as an event in the past.  History is an academic discipline that one gets to study with its sets of rules and methods for doing it; methodology is called.
Now, there is no previous [military history] before Columbus times by the simple reason that nobody has ever written about it, or has documented it in any other mean whatsoever.
Of course there had to be some fighting between clans or tribes; somebody knows about them? The answer is no, there is no history to it; that it was an assumed past event, certainly; but no one has said nothing about it.

The contributor has a Ph.D in history, the discipline, for some years now. Now that is history, I'm telling you about it. Oh, and by the way; it is no interpretation, is a fact.

==Heads up==
An article this size needs tons of citations. This article has none. The lead is also too short for FA. There are also several other problems that I will identify at [[WP:FARC]], which is where I'm taking the article.[[User:UberCryxic|UberCryxic]] 02:38, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
:*I agree with you. As it is now, this article is far away from FA status. I went through the article and gave it a detailes review in [[Wikipedia:Featured article review/Military history of Puerto Rico]].--[[User:Yannismarou|Yannismarou]] 08:22, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
:There is information here that has not been verified but that forms part of the traditional folklore. Diego Salcedo's drawwining is a myth there is no evidence of one Diego Salcedo ever living in puerto rico and the only diego salcedo in the americas lived in the dominican republic and died of old age. Please verify this facts with Francisco Scarano's History of Puerto Rico the standard textbook used in the University of Puerto rico and the smaller version used by the Department of Education. [[Special:Contributions/64.213.114.204|64.213.114.204]] ([[User talk:64.213.114.204|talk]]) 19:58, 4 January 2008 (UTC)

* It may be a myth, it may not. Sometimes it is hard to determine when a myth is a lie that has been accepted as a fact. However, the case is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia which relies only on reliable verifiable sources. As such it would be acceptable to quote the findings of Dr. Ricardo Alegría.  According to the respected and renowned Puerto Rican historian [[Ricardo Alegría]], &quot;The History of the Indians&quot;, Ricardo E. Alegría, 1969.[[http://ponce.inter.edu/tibes/ingles/salsedo2.html]] and other verifiable sites, there was a Diego Salcedo who was drowned by the Tainos. 

It must be remembered that history books are often written in accordance to the times and the beliefs of the author. For example, Nazi Germany attempted to rewrite their history books in accordance to their beliefs. Other nations have their history books in accordance to their beliefs. The United States for example, omitted the contributions made by the African-American community until recently and presently does not mention the contributions made by the Hispanics to the founding and formation of their country.

The history books used in Puerto Rico's educational system prior to 1898, were those written by Dr. [[Salvador Brau]]. However, after Puerto Rico became a possession of the United States, the Federal government asked the Commissioner of Education of Puerto Rico, Paul Miller, to rewrite an Americanized version of the history of Puerto Rico omitting some aspects of the islands history, which he did and which was then used in Puerto Rico's school.

What I'm trying to tell you here is that just because an incident is not mentioned in a history book widely used does not mean it did not occur. Gracias por escribir.  [[User:Marine 69-71|Tony the Marine]] ([[User talk:Marine 69-71|talk]]) 01:17, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

:Wikipedia is about verifiability not the &quot;truth&quot;, accounts of this event are widespread in books and other reliable sources, Francisco's version was written from his point of view and he didn't include it based on his own criteria, however the event is notable enought to warrant its inclusion in this and other historical articles. - [[User:Caribbean H.Q.|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000DD&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0066FF&quot;&gt;Ca&lt;font color=&quot;#0099FF&quot;&gt;ri&lt;font color=&quot;#00CCFF&quot;&gt;bb&lt;font color=&quot;#00EEFF&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;n&lt;/font&gt;~&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF3333&quot;&gt;H.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFCC00&quot;&gt;Q.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]] 01:36, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

==Accents==
I'm confused about accents throughout the Puerto Rican articles:  do you all have a custom of *not* using the accents in names, as per Spanish?  For example, [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Andrés).  Throughout the Venezuelan articles, we've put redirects to the correct names, with accents.  Maybe you all have a different custom?  [[User:SandyGeorgia|Sandy]] 21:57, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
:It depdens, if the article was written by Tony it probably does not have accents and diacritics. I, for one, place accents on Spanish names. The Puerto Rican group is divided in this regard. [[User:Joelr31|Joelito]] ([[User talk:Joelr31|talk]]) 22:01, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
::OK, if the group is divided, I'll not change whatever is there. I added an accent to a Garcia somewhere:  I'll go take it out. [[User:SandyGeorgia|Sandy]] 22:06, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
:::You may leave it. It will not be reverted. There is no harm in leaving the accent. [[User:Joelr31|Joelito]] ([[User talk:Joelr31|talk]]) 22:07, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
::::Too late :-)  [[User:SandyGeorgia|Sandy]] 22:08, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
:::::Proper names must be written in their language. And that includes not translating names and including accents. [[User:RAMPG|RAMPG]] 02:03, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
Yes it does needs accents.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/64.213.114.204|64.213.114.204]] ([[User talk:64.213.114.204|talk]]) 19:55, 4 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

**Good call and now it is done! I have added the following information: &quot;The Spanish Crown sent the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican Provisional Battalions to defend Cuba against the American invaders. The 1st Puerto Rican Provisional Battalion, composed of the Talavera Calvary and Krupp artillery, was sent to [[Santiago de Cuba]] where they battled the American forces in [[San Juan Hill]]. After the battle, the Puerto Rican Battalion suffered a total of 70% casualties which included their dead, wounded, MIA's and prisoners.&quot; Take care, [[User:Marine 69-71|Tony the Marine]] ([[User talk:Marine 69-71|talk]]) 00:09, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

{{edit semi-protected|Military history of Puerto Rico|answered=y}}
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;
A great history of Puertorricans in various wars. I see two prominent names missing. These are Edgardo Vasquez-Bruno, who served in the Rhodesian War on one of the Rhodesian Light Infantry's elite Fire Forces. He was later an Army Reserve Major. Also missing is Nelson Fishbach, who served as a paratrooper in the US Army's 509th Airborne Bde in Italy before leaving the US Army to enlist in the South African Special Forces. Corporal Fishbach served in the famous 32 Battalion in Angola as a Special Forces &quot;Recce&quot;. Former Sergeant Major Piet Nortje mentions Fishbach as the battalion's &quot;only Puerto Rican&quot; on page 57 of his book: &quot;32 Battalion, the inside story of South Africa's Elite Fighting Unit&quot;. Comment on the First World War, the French Foreign Legion lists having had four Puertorricans who served in its ranks in the First World War. And as regards the Hernandez brothers, according to a musical military historian, Miguel Hernandez of New York, Rafael Hernandez and his brother were recruited by James Reese Europe, bandmaster of the Harlem Hellfighters Band, specifically to add an Afro-Caribbean beat to the band's repertoire. Various members of the band went on to play important roles in the Jazz world in New York and Paris after the war. I have to wonder of one of them was responsible for the use in the 'clave' in certain jazz arrangements.

Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
