The '''Spruce Production Division''' was a unit of the [[United States Army]] that was established in 1917 to produce high-quality [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] timber and other wood products needed to make aircraft for the United States' efforts in [[World War I]]. The division was part of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Corps]]'s [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps|Aviation Section]]. Its headquarters were in [[Portland, Oregon]], and its main operations center was at [[Vancouver Barracks]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]]. Workers in the division were members of the [[Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen]], a union specifically established to support the army's wood production operations.

The division produced nearly {{convert|150|e6board feet|m3|lk=in}} of spruce in just 15 months, halting work almost as soon as the war ended. Col. [[Brice Disque]] was then put on trial for accusations that he had wasted millions of tax dollars. He was found not guilty of malfeasance.

The division had a large impact on logging in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Logging companies adopted working conditions similar to those the division had, and they took advantage of new logging roads and rail lines that the division had built to access more timber.

== Activation ==
[[File:Brigadier General Brice P. Disque.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Colonel Brice P. Disque|alt=General Brice P. Disque]]
From the beginning of [[World War I]], wood products were in great demand for war production. [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] was the most important tree species because its combination of lightness, strength, and resiliency was ideal for aircraft production.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDA plant guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/cs_pisi.pdf|title=Sitka spruce|work=NRCS Plant Guide|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|format=PDF|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, its long, tough fibers did not splinter when struck by bullets.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Speed production of spruce lumber|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50B17FD345C10738DDDAB0A94DF405B888DF1D3|accessdate=22 June 2011|format=PDF|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 July 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the United States entered the war, the [[Pacific Northwest]] had become the main supplier of spruce for aircraft production in [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and [[Italy]]. Northwest lumber mills, however, were never able to meet Europe's demand for spruce.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Gerald W|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/publications/fht/fhtspring1999/fhtspruce.pdf|title=The Spruce Production Division|format=PDF|work=Forest History Today|date=Spring 1999|publisher=The Forest History Society|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;br&gt; This is based on a paper by Gail E.

When the United States entered the war in 1917, General [[John J. Pershing]] sent [[Brice Disque|Brice P. Disque]], a former army captain, to the Pacific Northwest to determine if local labor issues within the forest products industry could be quickly resolved. Disque met with mill owners and representatives of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], the union that was trying to [[Trade union|organize]] loggers and sawmill workers in the Pacific Northwest. After studying the situation for several months, Disque determined that the long-standing labor management dispute could not be resolved without direct intervention by the army. Based on Disque's report, the United States Army Signal Corps was given the job of reorganizing the forest products industry in the Pacific Northwest to support United States war production.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;

On 29&amp;nbsp;September 1917, Disque was brought back into the army as a lieutenant colonel and was assigned to develop plans for an army unit to produce wood products for the war effort. On 6 November, Disque was promoted to colonel and given command of the newly formed Spruce Production Division, a part of the United States Army Signal Corps. The headquarters of the new unit were in [[Downtown Portland]], which was &quot;the centre of the great spruce area of the Pacific Northwest,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt; while the division's induction, training, and operations center was established at Vancouver Barracks across the [[Columbia River]] in Vancouver, Washington,&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCE&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Erigero|first=Patricia C.|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/fova/clr/clr2-4a.htm|chapter=IV.

== Production ==
[[File:SPD production graph.png|thumb|300px|The division produced a varied number of board feet of spruce each month.|alt=The division produced a quite variable amount of spruce each month.]]
Originally, the Spruce Production Division was authorized to induct 10,317&amp;nbsp;troops, including both officers and enlisted men. The Spruce Production Division quickly recruited several thousand experienced loggers and mill workers, many of whom were above the military draft age of 40. In May 1918, the division was authorized to grow to 28,825&amp;nbsp;personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;

Initially, both the mill owners and local unions were against the army's takeover of lumber production. The mill owners disliked having the army overseeing their businesses, and the unions saw soldiers' labor as a form of [[Strikebreaker|strikebreaking]]. Disque, however, called on everyone to support war production. He was also careful not to favor either owners or unions as he increased production, helping both sides achieve their goals. For the mill owners, military manpower kept mills open and running at full capacity; in addition, it prevented radicals from sabotaging facilities or equipment. The unions benefited because military rules stabilized wages and improved working conditions for loggers and sawmill workers throughout the Pacific Northwest. Among the improved conditions was a standard [[eight-hour day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/exhibits/war/ww1/economy.html|work=Oregon at War!|title=On the Home Front, Controlling Oregon's Economy for the War Effort|publisher=Oregon State Archives|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter the influence of union radicals in the Industrial Workers of the World, Disque sponsored an alternative union based on patriotism and labor–management cooperation. The new union, the [[Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen]], was established in 1917 and put under the leadership of Portland attorney Captain [[Maurice E. Crumpacker]], who would later serve as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]].&lt;ref name=ford&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The union was initially opposed by both labor and mill owners, but due to Disque's strong advocacy, within six months nearly all of the mill owners had agreed to support the union; by October 1918, it had 125,000&amp;nbsp;members.&lt;ref name=ford/&gt; In fact, the union lasted 20 years longer than the Spruce Production Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wells|first=Gail|url=http://oregonhistoryproject.org/narratives/the-oregon-coastforists-and-green-verdent-launs/unions-and-hard-times/union-activity-and-world-war-i/|title=Union Activity and World War I|work=The Oregon History Project|publisher=Oregon Historical Society|year=2006|access-date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spruce Production Division established approximately 60 military logging camps throughout the Pacific Northwest, usually near existing sawmills. While privately owned, these mills were operated under the direction of the army. On 20&amp;nbsp;December 1917, Disque reported that the division was only meeting 40&amp;nbsp;percent of the demand for spruce. He said that the production must be increased from {{convert|3|e6board feet|m3}} to {{convert|11|e6board feet|m3}} to meet the demand.&lt;ref name=&quot;spokesman&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Spruce output below demands|accessdate=22 June 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=82lWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pvMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=spruce%20and%20the%20airplane&amp;pg=6708%2C2408273|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|location=Spokane, Washington|date=21 December 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1918, the division opened a sawmill at Vancouver Barracks, the largest spruce sawmill in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Archaeology Lecture Series Starts This Week|last=Baker|first=Dean|date=1 July 1999|newspaper=The Columbian|page=C5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;producing more than one million feet of spruce lumber each day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Military Presence Constant in Vancouver|last=Pollard|first=Royce|date=11 February 1996|newspaper=The Columbian|page=G10|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=VC&amp;p_theme=vc&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Military%20presence%20constant%20in%20Vancouver&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=1996&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22Military%20presence%20constant%20in%20Vancouver%22)&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mill complex covered {{convert|50|acre|ha}} and was operated by 2,400&amp;nbsp;soldiers from the division. The army also built sawmills in [[Coquille, Oregon|Coquille]] and [[Toledo, Oregon]], and in [[Port Angeles, Washington]]. A 3,000-worker community in Washington was designed as a [[company town]] by architect [[Carl Frelinghuysen Gould|Carl F. Gould]].&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;{{cite book |author=Carlson, Linda |title= Company Towns of the Pacific Northwest |year= 2003 |page= 19 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location= Seattle |isbn= 0295983329 |oclc= 470297351}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|0.5|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} townsite was laid out with bunkhouses, and with dining and recreation halls styled after [[Great Camps|Adirondack lodges]].&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt; The division also built 13 railroads with over {{convert|130|mi|km}} of track to link logging areas to sawmills. At the peak of construction, there were 10,000&amp;nbsp;soldiers building railroads in Oregon and Washington forests.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSA&quot;/&gt; All wire rope manufactured in the west, as well as anything shipped in, was controlled by the spruce division per Colonel Disque. As the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported in February 1918, &quot;There was a serious shortage of wire rope when Col. Disque took charge of the spruce production campaign.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coast's Wire Rope Controlled by Army|date=21 February 1918|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|agency=Associated Press|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The division lasted only 15 months, during which it produced a total of {{convert|143008961|board feet}} of spruce. It produced nearly {{convert|54|e6board feet|m3}} for aircraft construction from Oregon forests alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WGR&quot;/&gt; Before the Pacific Northwest began logging spruce for the war, much of the lumber came from the eastern United States, where production amounted to just 15&amp;nbsp;percent of demand. Logging techniques in the east were not as advanced or as efficient with wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spruce and the airplane|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=11 April 1918|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network of roads and railroads that the division had built allowed for future development of the forests, which facilitated the growth of the lumber industry in the Pacific Northwest for the remainder of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WGR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSA&quot;/&gt;

== Demobilization ==
[[File:Stearns-Cuthbert-P-1918.jpg|right|thumb|Lt. Col. Cuthbert P. Stearns, Chief of Staff of the Spruce Production Division, US Army.]]
The armistice that ended World War I was signed on 11&amp;nbsp;November 1918. The next day, all Spruce Production Division logging ended, most construction projects were stopped, and sawmill operations were curtailed. Government machinery and equipment from all over the Northwest was shipped back to Vancouver Barracks, and division personnel were quickly discharged from military service. Over $12&amp;nbsp;million worth of logging equipment, sawmill machinery, and other property was eventually sold in a government auction.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCE&quot;/&gt;

While the Spruce Production Division was quickly demobilized after the war, there was some post-war controversy over the cost of its operations. Disque, by then a brigadier general, spent months answering to charges that his division had wasted taxpayers' money. [[United States Congress|Congress]] was particularly critical of the $4&amp;nbsp;million spent on an unfinished railroad located in the [[Olympic Peninsula]] of Washington. Disque responded that it was to be used for transporting spruce lumber. Eventually, the charges proved to be unfounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tide&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Turn in tide is for Disque|accessdate=21 February 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/160723609.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Sep%207,%201919&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los%20Angeles%20Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=TURN%20IN%20TIDE%20IS%20FOR%20DISQUE.|date=7 September 1919|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disque was discharged from the army in March 1919 to be &quot;appointed chairman of the export and import branch of the American International Corporation with headquarters at New York.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=General Disque Employed|date=22 March 1919|work=The Christian Science Monitor|page=2|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/doc/510198016.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar%2022,%201919&amp;author=&amp;pub=Christian%20Science%20Monitor&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=GENERAL%20DISQUE%20EMPLOYED|accessdate=1 November 2010|publisher=Christian Science Publishing Society}}&lt;br&gt; This article ends abruptly after the quote cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

Lt. Col. Cuthbert Stearns compiled a history of the Spruce Production Division, ''The Spruce Production Division, United States Army and Spruce Production Corporation'', that was published in 1919. This detailed record of the division's operations helped General Disque defend the cost of spruce production in his debate with members of Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt; The [[U.S. National Archives]] in [[Seattle]] holds approximately {{convert|187|cuft|m3}} of records related to the division, as well as &quot;a complete roster of all military personnel in the Spruce Production Division as of 1&amp;nbsp;November 1918.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OHS&quot; /&gt;

The effects of the Spruce Production Division continued long after the unit was demobilized. Not only did the division dramatically increase the production of forest products for the war effort, but the transportation network that it built helped open up Pacific Northwest forests to greater use in the decades that followed. In addition, the division's work rules became the standard for logging and sawmill operations throughout the Pacific Northwest well into the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSA&quot;/&gt;
