'''The Poona Horse''' is an armoured [[regiment]] in the [[Indian Army Armoured Corps|Armoured Corps]] of the [[Indian Army]]. The regiment, known before independence as '''The Poona Horse (17th Queen Victoria's Own Cavalry)''', was raised as a regular cavalry regiment in the [[Bombay Presidency]] army of the [[East India Company]].  It was formed from the [[3rd Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry]], raised in 1820, and the [[Poona Auxiliary Horse]], raised about 1817-18. The latter unit was absorbed into the regular forces about 1860 and the two regiments later became the 33rd Queen Victoria's Own Light Cavalry and the 34th Prince Albert Victor's Own Poona Horse. These were amalgamated in 1921 into the present regiment, the battle honours of which tell of service in three Afghan Wars, in Persia, Abyssinia and China, as well as in the Great War. The regiment has fought with distinction in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|Indo-Pakistani Wars]] with an officer winning India's highest gallantry award, the [[Param Vir Chakra]], in each war.

==History==
In accordance with the article VI of The [[Treaty of Poona]] between the British [[Governor-General of India]] [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings]] and [[Baji Rao II]] (The [[Peshwa]] of the [[Maratha]] [[Maratha Empire|Empire]]), a cavalry regiment was raised on 15 June 1817. As per the treaty the force would be maintained by the Maratha Peshwa and was supposed to be permanently stationed in the territory of Peshwas. The interesting part of the treaty was that the force could have been used against the Peshwa by the British when necessary. The regiment was raised under the order of [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] the [[Governor of Bombay]].

The two regiments that would go on to form the Poona Horse were the [[33rd Queen Victoria's Own Light Cavalry]] and the [[34th Prince Albert Victor's Own Poona Horse]].

==World War I==

In August 1914, the Poona Horse was stationed at [[Secunderabad]], as part of the [[9th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade]]. They were brigaded with the [[7th Dragoon Guards]] and the [[20th Deccan Horse]].&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak &gt;{{cite web|title=History of the 17th Horse|publisher=Bharat Rakshak - The Consortium of Indian Military Websites|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/images/Poona%20Horse.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020102936/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/images/Poona%20Horse.pdf|archivedate=20 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Brigade was dispatched to [[France]] and fought on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] their first action being the [[First Battle of Ypres]].&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak /&gt;

===France===
On 2 November 1914 the regiment was sent to reinforce the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd Gurkhas]] in the [[Neuve Chapelle]] sector on arrival they discovered that the [[Gurkha]]s defences had been breached and overrun. The Poona Horse was asked to recapture the position. The Regiment launched a counterattack in daylight and without any artillery support. The Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Swanston who was leading the attack was killed.&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;
In France the regiment would be involved in the Battle of Givenchy, Battle of La Basse, Battle of Armentiers, Battle of the Somme (1916), Battle of Flers–Courcelette and Battle of Cambrai (1917).&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;
In February 1918, the Poona Horse and all the other Indian cavalry regiments in France were deployed to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to join  General [[Edmund Allenby|Allenby’s]] forces.&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;

===Palestine===

The Poona Horse arrived in Egypt in April 1918, they now formed the [[14th Cavalry Brigade (British Indian Army)|14th Cavalry Brigade]] of the [[5th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|5th Cavalry Division]] with the [[9th Royal Deccan Horse|Deccan Horse]] and the [[Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry]].&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;

The force also consisted of the [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th Cavalry Division]], the [[Australian Mounted Division]] and the [[ANZAC Mounted Division]].&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;

On 19 September 1918, the allied offensive began. The Infantry broke through the Turkish defences and the Desert Mounted Corps followed up. When they reached the Gates of [[Damascus]], the Poona Horse, along with rest of the 14th Cavalry Brigade, were tasked with patrolling the road from Homs to Damascus Road. When they charged a party of Arabs who ran off leaving a large car behind with a [[Europe]]an seated inside the Risaldar Major Hamir Singh,  believing him to be a spy, demanded his surrender. The European turned out to be Colonel [[Lawrence of Arabia|TE Lawrence]]. “El Aurens” was not amused.&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;

At 10:15 on the morning of 1 October 1918, the Regiment entered Damascus and after the rest of the Brigade. The Regiment was ordered to take [[Rayak]] and then march onto [[Aleppo]], which they reached on 25 October just before the Armistice was signed on 30 October in Mudros Harbour, abroad the battleship {{HMS|Agamemnon|1906|6}}.&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;

===Mesopotamia===

The 33rd Queen Victoria's Own were sent to [[Mesopotamia]] as part of the [[6th (Poona) Division]] to counter Turkish advances and to protect the oil fields. They were involved in the [[Battle of Shaiba]] and the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (1915)|Battle of Ctesiphon]].&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;

==Between the wars==

In 1919, the 33rd Light Cavalry, now part of the [[1st (Risalpur) Cavalry Brigade]], was posted to [[Risalpur]] where they were brigaded with the [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|1st Lancers]] and [[M Battery Royal Horse Artillery|M Battery, RHA]]. On 6 May 1919, they received the information that the Afghan Army had attacked the outpost at [[Landi Khanna]], north of the [[Khyber Pass]], and was advancing into India.  The infantry attacked the Khyber Pass to push the Afghans back. Once the pass had been cleared the Cavalry advanced and after some skirmishing, and two set piece battles, the Afghan Army was dispersed.&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;

===Amalgamation===

In 1920, the decision was made to reduce the number of Indian Cavalry Regiments from 39 to 21. This would leave the army with  18 amalgamated regiments, plus the [[27th Light Cavalry]], the [[28th Light Cavalry]] and the [[10th Queen Victoria's Own Corps Of Guides Cavalry (Frontier Force)|Guides Cavalry]]. This change was promulgated under Indian Army Order No 1257 November 22, 1921. Based on this decision, the 33rd Light Cavalry and 34th Poona Horse were amalgamated as the 33rd/34th Cavalry, which was changed in 1922 to the 17th Queen Victoria's
Own Poona Horse.&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;
The Regiments new organisation was now three sabre squadrons and a headquarters squadron, which would contain all the specialists, i.e., machine gunners, signalers etc., into one squadron.&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;

==World War II==

The Poona Horse was one of two Indian Army cavalry regiments selected to remain horsed while the rest of the cavalry was mechanised. This situation did not last long and just after the start of the war the regiment was mechanised.
The Headquarters Squadron now had a mortar troop, signals troop, 'B' echelon administrative troop and light Aid Detachment for forward vehicle recovery and repair.  The sabre Squadrons each now comprised a Squadron Headquarters, four armoured carrier troops and one rifle troop. Each troop had four Bren carriers and the rifle troop was mounted in four 15 cwt Chevrolet trucks now mechanised they become the Divisional reconnaissance regiment for the [[6th Indian Division]] and deployed to [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;
In 1942 the regiment was ordered to the middle east to join the [[British Eighth Army]]. In the closing stages of the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], the Poona Horse was the guard force for General [[Claude Auchinleck]], the commander of the 8th Army at the tactical headquarters sited on the [[Ruweisat Ridge]], the most prominent tactical feature of the Alamein position. This was the highlight of the Regiment's war for they were then ordered back to Iraq as part of the [[British Tenth Army]].&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;
In September 1944 the Regiment was sent to [[Cyprus]] on garrison duties and were still there in May 1945 when Germany surrendered.&lt;ref name=bharat-rakshak/&gt;
The Regiment returned to India in October 1945 and were issued their first tanks, the [[Stuart tank|Stuart MK IV]].

==Post Independence==

Post Independence the Regiment was part of the [[1st Armoured Division (India)]]
and participated in [[Operation Polo]], [[Operation Ablaze]] and [[Operation Nepal]].
The division consisted of the 9th Armoured Brigade and 43rd Lorried Infantry Brigade.  The Armoured Brigade consisted of the [[16th Cavalry]], [[Hodson's Horse]] and the Poona Horse equipped with upgunned [[Sherman tank]]s and [[Centurion tank]]s.
