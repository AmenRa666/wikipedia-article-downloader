'''No. 8 Service Flying Training School''' (No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS) was a flying training school of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) that operated during World War&amp;nbsp;II.  It was formed in December 1941, and graduated its first course in March 1942. Responsible for intermediate and advanced instruction of pilots under the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS), the school was based at [[Bundaberg Airport|RAAF Station Bundaberg]], Queensland, and operated [[Avro Anson]] aircraft. It spawned two maritime patrol squadrons in early 1943, raised in response to increased Japanese submarine activity off Australia's east coast. Some of the school's aircraft were also attached to the [[Australian Army]] in 1944–45. No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS completed its final training course in December 1944, and was disbanded in July 1945.

==History==
RAAF aircrew training expanded dramatically following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, in response to Australia's participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war flight training facility, [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Station Point Cook]], Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve Elementary Flying Training Schools (EFTS), eight Service Flying Training Schools (SFTS), and [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] (CFS).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison111&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; While CFS turned out new [[flight instructor]]s, the EFTS provided basic training to prospective pilots who, if successful, would go on to an SFTS for further instruction that focussed on operational (or &quot;service&quot;) flying.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt;  The course at SFTS typically consisted of two streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 109]&lt;/ref&gt; The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew rose and fell. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;8 Service Flying Training School (No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS) was formed at [[Bundaberg Airport|RAAF Station Bundaberg]], Queensland, on 14&amp;nbsp;December 1941, under the control of No.&amp;nbsp;2 Training Group. Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander I.C.C. Thomson.&lt;ref name=&quot;8SFTS&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, Vol. 8'', pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;
The new school was reported to have cost [[Australian Pound|£]]300,000 to establish, and joined [[No. 12 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;12 Elementary Flying Training School]] (No.&amp;nbsp;12 EFTS), which was already based—temporarily—at Bundaberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;8SFTS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81628974 |title=To-day |newspaper=The Northern Miner |location=Charters Towers, Queensland |date=9 December 1941 |accessdate=2 June 2012 |page=2 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47172461 |title=New flying school |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth  |date=6 December 1941 |accessdate=2 June 2012 |page=6 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS received its first aircraft in January 1942: 27 [[Avro Anson]]s released by other units. The same month, No.&amp;nbsp;12 EFTS transferred to its permanent home at [[Lowood, Queensland|RAAF Station Lowood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;8SFTS&quot;/&gt; The standard intake of pilots at No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS each month was 50, and the initial course of students graduated in March 1942. By July that year, the total number of aircraft operated by the school had increased to 87.&lt;ref name=&quot;8SFTS&quot;/&gt;

Flying accidents were commonplace at training establishments and No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS was no exception; taxiing collisions, crash landings in the surrounding cane fields, and runway overshoots were regular occurrences. At least two aircraft were damaged each month in the early part of 1942. The school's first fatality, however, was from drowning, when staff were called out to assist victims of local flooding in February, and an [[aircraftman]] died during an attempted rescue.&lt;ref name=&quot;8SFTS&quot;/&gt; On 1&amp;nbsp;June 1942, an Anson crashed into the sea off [[Bargara, Queensland|Bargara]], near Bundaberg; the pilot and two crew were reported as missing, believed killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAA0&quot;&gt;[http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=7127532 Avro Anson Accidents Part 2 p. 26] at [[National Archives of Australia]].

The outbreak of the [[Pacific War]] in December 1941 had led to aircraft at many SFTSs being classified as Second Line (Reserve) aircraft in the defence of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/11.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp. 234–238]&lt;/ref&gt; Following directions issued in May 1942, No.&amp;nbsp;71 Reserve Squadron was raised at Bundaberg, using resources allocated from No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAA5&quot;&gt;[http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=1358870 Operations Record Book&amp;nbsp;– No.&amp;nbsp;71 Squadron, p. 2] at National Archives of Australia. Retrieved on 4 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the Ansons assigned to the squadron crashed on 5&amp;nbsp;June 1942 after running out of fuel in bad weather at night, killing the pilot and two crew members.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAA6&quot;&gt;[http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=7127542 Avro Anson Accidents Part 12, p. 26] at National Archives of Australia. Retrieved on 4 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Japanese submarine activity off Australia's east coast, the [[Government of Australia|Federal government]] formally established two RAAF [[maritime patrol]] units in the first half of 1943 with personnel and aircraft from No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather&quot;&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, Vol. 4'', pp. 83, 88&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 71 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 Squadron]] was formed as a separate entity to the flying school on 26&amp;nbsp;January at Lowood, maintaining detachments at RAAF Stations Bundaberg and [[RAAF Base Amberley|Amberley]] in Queensland, as well as at [[RAAF Base Richmond|Richmond]] and, later, [[Coffs Harbour Airport|Coffs Harbour]] in New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, Vol. 4'', pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 66 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;66 Squadron]] was formed at Bundaberg on 20&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;66SQN&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, Vol. 4'', pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt; The squadrons undertook [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]], convoy escort, search-and-rescue, and army/naval cooperation duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather&quot;/&gt; With the lessening of Japanese submarine activity towards the end of 1943, the staff and aircraft of No.&amp;nbsp;66 Squadron were judged to be more urgently needed for training purposes; the unit was disbanded on 6&amp;nbsp;January 1944 and its assets divided between No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS and [[No. 1 Operational Training Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Operational Training Unit]] at [[RAAF Base East Sale|RAAF Station East Sale]], Victoria, as well as No.&amp;nbsp;71 Squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;66SQN&quot;/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;71 Squadron was itself disbanded on 28&amp;nbsp;August 1944 at Coffs Harbour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather&quot;/&gt;

One of the flying school's graduates in August 1944 was [[David Evans (RAAF officer)|David Evans]], who went on to become [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, ''Down to Earth'', pp. 9, 235&lt;/ref&gt; His passing-out parade was delayed by a month because, as Evans later discovered, the British government had peremptorily decided in April that it no longer required graduates from Australia, leaving the RAAF with a surplus of some 7,000 aircrew.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, ''Down to Earth'', pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; With training at No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS winding down, in October 1944 a civil operator, Aircraft Pty Ltd, began using Bundaberg for its flights between [[Brisbane]] and [[Rockhampton]]. The following month, six of the school's Ansons were detached to the [[Australian Army]], carrying out exercises with [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]] at [[Mareeba, Queensland|Mareeba]] until March 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;8SFTS&quot;/&gt; The last course to graduate at No.&amp;nbsp;8 SFTS did so on 13&amp;nbsp;December 1944; all pilots still under instruction were transferred to [[No. 6 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No. 6 Service Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Base Mallala|RAAF Station Mallala]], South Australia, to finish their course.  The school spent the next few months preparing the base to be handed over to elements of the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force|Netherlands East Indies Air Force]] before disbanding on 25&amp;nbsp;July 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;8SFTS&quot;/&gt;
