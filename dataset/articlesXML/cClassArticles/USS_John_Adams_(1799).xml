The first '''''John Adams''''' was originally built in 1799 as a [[frigate]] for the [[United States Navy]], converted to a [[corvette]] in 1809, and later converted back to a [[frigate]] in 1830. Named for President [[John Adams]], she fought in the [[Quasi-War]], the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s, the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican-American War]] and the [[American Civil War]]. At the end of her career, she participated in the Union blockade of South Carolina's ports. She then participated in a historic raid that [[Harriet Tubman]], the former slave and Union operative, organized with Union colonel Montgomery. ''John Adams'' led three steam-powered gunboats up the Harbor River to Port Royal. The squadron relied on local black mariners to guide it past mines and fortifications. The squadron freed 750+ slaves and unsettled [[Confederate States of America|the Confederacy]]. Tubman was the first woman in U.S. history to plan and execute an armed expedition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Combahee-River-Raid-Lowcountry-Liberation/dp/1626194742/Combahee River Raid&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''John Adams'' should not be confused with the frigate {{USS|Adams|1799|6}}.

==Origin==

''John Adams'' was built for the United States by the people of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], under contract to Paul Pritchard and launched in the latter's shipyard some {{convert|3|mi|km}} from Charleston 5 June 1799.

==Quasi-War==
Captain [[George Cross]] sailed ''John Adams'' on or about 1 October for [[Cayenne, French Guiana]], to operate against French privateers based at that port. By the time she arrived off South America, the British had captured [[Surinam]],  which made the French base in Guiana unsafe for privateers. Captain Cross therefore decided to sail her on to [[Guadeloupe]] to join her squadron.

Early in January 1800, she began operations against the French, taking an unidentified lugger off [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] and recapturing [[brig]] ''Dolphin''. She then retook the brigs ''Hannibal'' on 22 March and ''Atlantic'' the next day, both prizes of the French privateer ''President Tout''. The French privateer schooner ''Jason'' surrendered to her 3 April, and in May she retook schooners ''Dispatch''&lt;!-- Or USS Despatch (1814)? --&gt; and ''William''. Sometime in the late spring or summer she recaptured the American brig ''Olive'', and on 13 June she took French schooner ''Decade''. These victories punctuated and highlighted the day-to-day duty of patrolling the [[West Indies]]. She continued to protect American shipping through the late summer and fall.

''John Adams'' left on 5 December escorting a convoy to the United States. She was placed [[Reserve fleet|in ordinary]] in Charleston in mid-January 1801, and then in late June she sailed to [[Washington, D.C.]] where she was laid up.

As the [[Quasi-War]] with France drew to a close, President Adams could report to [[United States Congress|Congress]]:&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;The present Navy of the United States, called suddenly into existence by a great national emergency, has raised us in our own esteem; and by the protection afforded to our commerce has effected to the extent of our expectations the objects for which it was created.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==First Barbary War==
Peace with France freed the Navy for operations against [[Barbary]] corsairs who had been preying on American shipping in the Mediterranean. A small squadron under Commodore [[Richard Dale]], sent out in 1801 for operations against [[Tripoli]], was followed in 1802 by a much stronger force under Commodore [[Richard Valentine Morris]]. On 22 October ''John Adams'', under the command of Captain [[John Rodgers (naval officer, War of 1812)|John Rodgers]], sailed from [[Hampton Roads]] to join Commodore Morris. After escorting vessels from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Málaga]] and [[Minorca]], she finally caught up with Commodore Morris at [[Malta]] on 5 January 1803. She then operated with the squadron until 3 May when she received orders to cruise independently off Tripoli. Upon arriving off Tripoli, ''John Adams'', still under the command of  Rodgers, boldly attacked the forts and the gunboats anchored under their protection. Several days later she captured 28-gun Tripolitan cruiser ''Meshuda''. After {{USS|New York|1800|6}} and {{USS|Enterprise|1799|6}} joined her, ''John Adams'' engaged a flotilla of enemy gunboats off Tripoli on 22 May sending them scurrying back into the harbor to safety. Five days later—with the added support of {{USS|Adams|1799|6}}, a sister frigate also named for President John Adams—the squadron again bested a group of pirate [[gunboat]]s.

One of the most important victories of the war came on 21 June when ''John Adams'' and ''Enterprise'' captured a 22-gun vessel belonging to Tripoli, thus weakening that state sufficiently to allow the squadron to turn its attention to [[Tunis]], [[Algiers]], and [[Morocco]], which were threatening U.S. commerce in the Western [[Mediterranean]]. Throughout the summer and early fall ''John Adams'' operated in that quarter before returning home with New York.

Meanwhile, Commodore [[Edward Preble]], who had led a powerful fleet to the Mediterranean, vigorously pressed the fight. In August and September 1804 he made a series of major attacks on Tripoli. As the second of these blows was being delivered 7 August, ''John Adams'', now under Captain [[Isaac Chauncey]], arrived on the scene deeply laden with stores. Her boats participated in a reconnaissance patrol on the night of 18 August, and 6 days later she slipped in close to the city for an intensive 4-hour bombardment. Two nights later during a similar attack, an enemy shot sank one of ''John Adams''{{'}}s boats, killing three men and wounding a fourth, as the American Squadron severely punished Tripoli with over 700 well-directed rounds which took effect within the city. After a fifth attack had been successfully completed 3 September, bad weather interrupted operations and ''John Adams'' sailed to [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] with other ships of the squadron.

Three months later she sailed for New York with Commodore Preble, arriving 26 February 1805. After a third Mediterranean cruise from May to November, she was laid up in ordinary. In service she had been considered a poor sailer; between 1807-09 her [[forecastle]] and [[quarterdeck]] were removed and she was re-rated as (depending on the source) either a corvette or a sloop-of-war.

==War of 1812==
The outbreak of the [[War of 1812]] found her undergoing repairs at Boston whence she was hurried to New York to have the work completed. There the British blockade and a critical shortage of seamen kept her in a laid-up status until early 1814. She finally sailed under a flag of truce carrying peace commissioners [[Henry Clay]] and [[Jonathan Russell]] to [[Europe]] and arrived [[Wargo Island]], [[Norway]], 14 April. She returned to the United States 5 September bringing dispatches from the American commissioners the [[Treaty of Ghent]] that would end the war towards the end of the year.

==Second Barbary War==
Meanwhile, the Barbary pirates, taking advantage of the American Navy's preoccupation with the British fleet during the War of 1812, had resumed operations against American merchantmen in the Mediterranean. Fortunately the treaty of peace signed on Christmas Eve 1814 freed United States men-of-war for renewed attention to this chronic trouble spot. In the autumn of 1815 ''John Adams''  arrived in the Mediterranean to assist frigates {{USS|United States|1797|6}} and {{USS|Constellation|1797|6}} and sloops {{USS|Erie|1813|6}} and {{USS|Ontario|1813|6}} in maintaining peace and order in the area after strong squadrons under Commodores [[Stephen Decatur]] and [[William Bainbridge]] had induced the Barbary princes to honor their treaty commitments. Early in 1816 she returned home with dispatches, and with marble from Naples for refurbishing the Capitol at Washington.&lt;ref&gt;''National Intelligencer'', February 10, 1816&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Indies==
Pirates were also active in the [[West Indies]] at this time. Taking advantage of the chaos attendant upon the dissolution of Spain's American empire, lawless vessels from many nations preyed on neutral as well as Spanish commerce in the [[Caribbean]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and along the storied Spanish Main. For the next few years ''John Adams'' was busy fighting buccaneers. On 22 December 1817 she demanded and received the surrender of [[Amelia Island]], off the east coast of [[Florida]], the base from which [[Privateer|corsairs]] of Commodore [[:es:Luis Aury|Luis Aury]] pounced upon merchantmen of all nations.

==Venezuela==
In the spring of 1819 [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Smith Thompson]] selected Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] for the mission of establishing friendly relations with the government of newly independent [[Venezuela]] and negotiating to obtain restitution for United States vessels that the Venezuelans had illegally taken during the revolution. Perry boarded his flagship ''John Adams'' at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] and sailed in company with schooner {{USS|Nonsuch|1813|6}} on 7 June. A month later he reached the mouth of the [[Orinoco]], which he ascended to [[Ciudad Bolívar|Angostura]] in ''Nonsuch'' while ''John Adams'' sailed on to [[Trinidad]] to await his return at [[Port of Spain]]. After protracted negotiation, the government of Venezuela granted all the demands of the United States on 11 August. However, during the passage down the river, Perry was stricken with [[yellow fever]] and died on board the ''John Adams''.

Commodore [[Charles Morris (naval officer)|Charles Morris]] succeeded Perry in command of the squadron and ''John Adams'' accompanied his flagship ''Constellation'' on a voyage to the [[Plata River]] to continue the negotiations inaugurated by Perry to establish friendly relations with the new [[Latin American]] republics and to protect American commerce from South American privateers. After visiting [[Montevideo]] and [[Buenos Aires]], both ships returned to the United States, arriving [[Hampton Roads]] on 24 April 1820.

==1821–1845==
In spite of these successes, piracy remained rampant in the West Indies, and ''John Adams'' was part of a strong [[West Indies Squadron (United States)|West Indies Squadron]] created in 1821 to cope with the problem. [[Nicholas Biddle (1750-1778)|Nicholas Biddle]]'s ships labored with zeal; but the task, entailing careful searches by small-boat expeditions of innumerable bays, lagoons, and inlets, seemed endless. Yellow fever took a much heavier toll than the enemy necessitating reinforcements which arrived 3 March 1823 when Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s &quot;[[Mosquito Fleet]]&quot; anchored off [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]]. Porter, the squadron's new commander, selected ''John Adams'' as his flagship. When Porter was recalled, his successor, Commodore [[Lewis Warrington]] retained ''John Adams'' as his flagship until 1826. From time to time, thereafter, the frigate returned to the West Indies for operations against pirates until 1829 when she was laid up and almost entirely rebuilt at the Navy Yard in [[Gosport, Virginia]].

''John Adams'' joined the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean Squadron]] in 1831 as a frigate. One of her first duties was to take her former commander, ex-Commodore Porter, to [[Constantinople]] where he became the U.S.'s first chargé d'affaires. The ship was granted the rare privilege of passing through the [[Dardanelles]] with guns mounted. Thereafter, she convoyed ships in the [[Mediterranean]] and in 1833 visited [[Liberia]].

After extensive repairs in the United States, ''John Adams'' sailed from Hampton Roads on 5 May 1838, accompanied by {{USS|Columbia|1836|6}}, on a cruise around the world. Particular stress was placed upon showing the flag in the [[East Indies]] where the United States enjoyed a prosperous and growing trade. Both ships arrived [[Rio de Janeiro]] 10 July but departed separately, ''John Adams'' sailing on 25 July. She stopped at Zanzibar en route to Bombay, where she rejoined ''Columbia'' before sailing on to Goa and Colombo, Ceylon.

At Colombo the ships learned that natives at Susoh (currently in [[Southwest Aceh Regency]], [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]]) had attacked the American ship ''Eclipse''. The squadron immediately sailed to the scene of the incident and bombarded the forts at [[Kuala Batee]] to induce the [[Raja]]hs of Sumatra to agree to offer assistance and protection to American vessels. They then landed over 300 marines and sailors to attack the village of Muckie, which they destroyed ([[Second Sumatran Expedition]]). Before returning to Rio de Janeiro on 23 April 1840, the squadron called at [[Singapore]], [[Macau]], [[Honolulu]], [[Valparaíso]], and [[Cape Horn]].

==Mexican-American and Civil Wars==
''John Adams'' finally arrived Boston about the middle of June where she was laid up until 1842. After duty on the [[Brazil Station]], she went into [[Reserve fleet|ordinary]] where she remained until recommissioned at the beginning of the Mexican-U.S. War.

She was anchored off the bar at [[Santiago de Querétaro|Santiago]] 8 May 1846 during the [[Battle of Palo Alto]]. She then maintained a blockading station off the east coast of Mexico for the remainder of the war.

''John Adams'' returned to Boston in September 1848 and received extensive repairs before joining the [[Africa Station]] for action with the [[Royal Navy]] against the slave trade. She returned from this difficult duty in July 1853. Thereafter, with the exception of periods at home for repairs, ''John Adams'' operated in the [[Pacific]] and the [[Far East]] until after the outbreak of the Civil War. She sailed for home from [[Siam]] 6 July 1861 and reached New York 11 January 1862, bringing a box containing two letters from the [[King of Siam]] to President Lincoln, along with a sword and a pair of ivory tusks.

''John Adams'' was sent to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], the wartime location of the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]], to act as training ship for [[midshipmen]]. In the summer of 1863 she joined the [[South Atlantic Blockading Squadron]] and took station off [[Morris Island]] inside [[Charleston Bar]]. There she served as [[flagship]] of the inner blockade until she sailed into the harbor after the evacuation of Charleston in February 1865.

One of her crew, Coxswain [[Oliver O'Brien]], received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions during the 1864 capture of a [[blockade runner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;moh&quot;/&gt; Another member of her crew, Acting Ensign [[Prince Pierre, Duke of Penthièvre|Pierre d'Orléans]], was a member of the Orleansist branch of the [[House of Orléans|French royal family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paoli|first=Dominique|title=Fortunes &amp; Infortunes des princes d'Orleans : (1848-1918)|year=2006|publisher=Artena|isbn=2-35154-004-2|pages=139–140|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
Late in the summer of 1865 she sailed to Boston where she was decommissioned in September. ''John Adams'' was sold 5 October 1867.
