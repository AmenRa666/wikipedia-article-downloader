[[The Holocaust]] in [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German-occupied Belgium]] refers to the persecution and attempted extermination of [[Jews]] and [[Romani (people)|Roma]] between 1940 and 1944 during [[World War II]].

At the start of the war, the population of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70–75,000 out of a population of 8 million. Most lived in the cities of [[Antwerp]], [[Brussels]], [[Charleroi]] and [[Liège]]. The vast majority were recent immigrants to Belgium who had fled persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe, and, as a result, only a small minority actually possessed Belgian citizenship.

Shortly after the [[Battle of Belgium|invasion of Belgium]], the [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|Military Government]] passed a series of anti-Jewish laws in October 1940. The Belgian [[Committee of Secretary-Generals]] refused from the start to co-operate on passing any anti-Jewish measures and the Military Government seemed unwilling to pass further legislation. The German government began to seize Jewish-owned businesses and forced Jews out of positions in the civil service. In April 1941, without orders from the German authorities, Flemish collaborators pillaged two synagogues in [[Antwerp]] and burned the house of the chief [[rabbi]] of the town in the Antwerp Pogrom. The Germans created a {{lang|de|''[[Judenrat]]''}} in the country, the {{lang|fr|''Association des Juifs en Belgique''}} (AJB; &quot;Association of Jews in Belgium&quot;), which all Jews were required to join. As part of the [[Final Solution]] from 1942, the persecution of Belgian Jews escalated. From May 1942, Jews were forced to wear yellow [[Yellow badge|Star of David badges]] to mark them out in public. Using the registers compiled by the AJB, the Germans began deporting Jews to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in the [[General Government]] (the occupied portion of Poland). Jews chosen from the registration lists were required to turn up at the newly established [[Mechelen transit camp]]; they were then deported by [[Holocaust train|train]] to concentration camps, mostly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Between August 1942 and July 1944, around 25,000 Jews and 350 Roma were deported from Belgium; more than 24,000 were killed before the camps were liberated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

From 1942, opposition among the general population to the treatment of the Jews in Belgium grew. By the end of the occupation, more than 40 per cent of all Jews in Belgium were in hiding; many of them were hidden by [[Gentile]]s, particularly by Catholic priests and nuns. Some were helped by the organized resistance, such as the {{lang|fr|''[[Comité de Défense des Juifs]]''}} (CDJ; &quot;Committee of Jewish Defence&quot;), which provided food and refuge to hiding Jews. Many of the Jews in hiding joined the armed resistance. In April 1943, members of the CDJ attacked the [[twentieth convoy|twentieth rail convoy]] to Auschwitz and succeeded in rescuing some of those being deported.

==Background==

===Religion and anti-Semitism===
[[File:Synagogue de Bruxelles.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Great Synagogue of Brussels]], built in 1875.]]
{{see also|History of the Jews in Belgium}}
Before the war, the population of Belgium was overwhelmingly [[Catholic]]. Around 98 per cent of the population was baptized and around 80 per cent of marriage ceremonies were held with traditional Catholic services, while politically the country was dominated by the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|chapter=The Attitudes of the Belgian Roman Catholic Clergy towards Jews prior to the Occupation|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish population of Belgium was comparatively small. Out of a population of around 8 million, there were only 10,000 Jews in the country before [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Saerens160&gt;{{cite book|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|chapter=Antwerp's Attitudes towards the Jews from 1918–1940 and its Implications for the Period of Occupation|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interwar period saw substantial Jewish immigration to Belgium. By 1930, the population rose to 50,000, and by 1940 it was between 70,000–75,000.&lt;ref name=Saerens160/&gt; Most of the new Jewish immigrants came from [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Nazi Germany]], escaping [[anti-Semitism]] and poverty in their native countries.&lt;ref name=Saerens160/&gt; The Roma population of Belgium at the same time was approximately 530.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niewyk|first1=Donald|last2=Nicosia|first2=Francis|title=The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust|page=31|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=Columbia|isbn=0-231-11200-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few of the Jewish migrants claimed Belgian citizenship, and many did not speak [[French language|French]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Jewish communities developed in [[Charleroi]], [[Liège]], [[Brussels]] and, above all, [[Antwerp]], where more than half of the Jews in Belgium lived.&lt;ref name=Saerens160/&gt;

The Interwar period also saw the rise in popularity of Fascist [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]] parties in Belgium. These were chiefly represented by the {{lang|nl|''[[Flemish National Union|Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]]''}} (VNV; &quot;Flemish National Union&quot;) and {{lang|nl|''[[Verdinaso]]''}} in Flanders, and {{lang|fr|''[[Rexism|Rex]]''}} in [[Wallonia]]. Both Flemish parties supported the creation of an ethnically Germanic &quot;{{lang|nl|''[[Greater Netherlands|Dietse Natie]]''}}&quot; (&quot;Greater Dutch State&quot;) from which Jews would be excluded.&lt;ref name=Saerens175&gt;{{cite book|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|chapter=Antwerp's Attitudes towards the Jews from 1918–1940 and its Implications for the Period of Occupation|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|fr|''Rex''}}, whose ideology was based on [[Christofascism|Christian Fascism]], was particularly anti-Semitic, but both VNV and {{lang|fr|''Rex''}} campaigned under anti-Semitic slogans for the 1938 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|chapter=Antwerp's Attitudes towards the Jews from 1918–1940 and its Implications for the Period of Occupation|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|pages=182–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their stance was officially condemned by the Belgian authorities, but prominent figures, including [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]], were suspected of holding anti-Semitic attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Eeckhaut|first=Fabien|title=Léopold III: Roi trop passif sous l'Occupation?|url=http://www.rtbf.be/info/belgique/detail_leopold-iii-trop-passif-sous-l-occupation?id=8088835|newspaper=[[RTBF]]|date=13 September 2013|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From June 1938, Jewish illegal immigrants arrested by the Belgian police were deported to Germany, until public condemnation halted the practice after {{lang|de|''[[Kristallnacht]]''}} in November 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|chapter=Antwerp's Attitudes towards the Jews from 1918–1940 and its Implications for the Period of Occupation|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|pages=184–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1938 and the start of the war, with the influence of [[Fascist]] parties declining in Belgium, the country began accepting more Jewish refugees, including 215 from the {{MS|St. Louis}} who had been refused [[Visa (document)|visas]] elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|chapter=Antwerp's Attitudes towards the Jews from 1918–1940 and its Implications for the Period of Occupation|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German invasion and occupation===
{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}
In the [[interwar period]], Belgium followed a strict policy of [[political neutrality]]. Though the [[Belgian Land Component]] was mobilized in 1939, the country only became involved in the war on 10 May 1940, when it was [[Battle of Belgium|invaded by Nazi Germany]]. After a campaign lasting 18 days, the Belgian military, along with its commander-in-chief Leopold III, surrendered on 28 May. Belgium, together with the French province of [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], were grouped together under the German [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France]] (''Militärverwaltung in Belgien und Nordfrankreich''). Because the country was under [[military occupation]], it initially fell under the control of the {{lang|de|''[[Wehrmacht]]''}} rather than [[Nazi Party]] or [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) authorities. In July 1944, the ''Militärverwaltung'' was replaced with [[Reichskommissariat of Belgium and Northern France|a civilian administration]] (''Zivilverwaltung''), greatly increasing the power of the more radical Nazi Party and SS organisations until the Allied liberation in September 1944.

==The Holocaust==

===Early discrimination and persecution, 1940-41===
[[File:Poster denoting Jewish-owned business from occupied Belgium.jpg|thumb|Trilingual (German-Dutch-French) signs used to mark Jewish-owned shops and businesses in Belgium from October 1940]]
On 23 October 1940, the German Military Administration adopted anti-Jewish legislation for the first time.&lt;ref name=Steinberg200&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Maxime|chapter=The Judenpolitik in Belgium within the West European Context: Comparative Observations|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new laws, similar to the [[Nuremberg Laws]] adopted in Germany in 1935, coincided with the adoption of similar legislation in the Netherlands and [[Vichy laws on the status of Jews|in France]].&lt;ref name=Steinberg200/&gt; The laws of 28 October forbade Jews to practice certain professions (including the civil service) and forced Jews to register with their local municipality.&lt;ref name=Deplancq&gt;{{cite web|last=Delplancq|first=Thierry|title=Des paroles et des actes: L'administration bruxelloise et le registre des Juifs, 1940–1941|url=http://www.cegesoma.be/docs/media/chtp_beg/chtp_12/chtp12_005_Dossier_Delplancq.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society|Cegesoma]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same date, the German administration announced a definition of who was regarded as Jewish. Jewish-owned shops or businesses had to be marked by a sign in the window, and Jewish-owned economic assets had to be registered.&lt;ref name=Deplancq/&gt; From June 1940, a list of Jewish businesses had already been drawn up in Liège.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Bob|title=The Fragility of Law: Constitutional Patriotism and the Jews of Belgium, 1940–1945 (review)|journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies|volume=23|issue=3|date=Winter 2010|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the German government began to liquidate Jewish businesses. Some were transferred to German ownership in a process termed [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]].&lt;ref name=Steinberg201&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Maxime|chapter=The Judenpolitik in Belgium within the West European Context: Comparative Observations|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 6,300 Jewish-owned businesses were liquidated before 1942, and 600 were Aryanized.&lt;ref name=Yahil343&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahil|first=Leni|title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932–1945|series=Studies in Jewish History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|location=Oxford|edition=Reprint (trans.)|isbn=0-19-504523-8|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 600 million Belgian francs was raised from the seizures, much less than anticipated.&lt;ref name=Steinberg201/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yahil394/&gt;

In total, between 28 October 1940 and 21 September 1942, 17 anti-Jewish ordinances were proclaimed by the Military Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Présence juive dans nos régions|url=http://www.new.mjb-jmb.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=164750&amp;Itemid=276|publisher=Musée Juif de Belgique|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Association des Juifs en Belgique''====
The &quot;Association of Jews in Belgium&quot; (AJB) was a {{lang|de|''[[Judenrat]]''}} created by the Germans to administer the Jewish population of Belgium from November 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michman|first=Dan|chapter=Research on the Holocaust: Belgium and General|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though directed by the Germans, the AJB was run by Jews and acted as an &quot;organizational [[ghetto]]&quot;, allowing the Nazis to deal with Belgian Jews as a unit.&lt;ref name=Maron&gt;{{Cite news|last=Maron|first=Guy|title=Des Juifs, Curateurs du Ghetto Juif|newspaper=[[Le Soir]]|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/histoire-l-association-des-juifs-en-belgique-sous-l-occ_t-20041110-Z0PYWC.html|date=10 November 2004|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AJB played a major role in registering Jews in the country. In total, 43,000 Jews were registered with the AJB.&lt;ref name=Yahil343/&gt; This number represents only half of the total Jewish population, reflecting the community's mistrust of the organization, but it was the figure that {{lang|de|''SS-[[Obersturmbannführer]]''}} [[Adolf Eichmann]] presented as the total number of Jews in Belgium at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cesarani|first=David|authorlink=David Cesarani|title=Eichmann: His Life and Crimes|year=2005|origyear=2004|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=978-0-09-944844-0|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the deportations, around 10,000 Jews were arrested based on their affiliation to the AJB.&lt;ref name=Steinberg216&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Maxime|chapter=The Judenpolitik in Belgium within the West European Context: Comparative Observations|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AJB, closely supervised by the {{lang|de|''SiPo-SD''}} (''[[Sicherheitspolizei]] und [[Sicherheitsdienst]]''; &quot;Security Police and Intelligence Service&quot;), was also responsible for the administration of the transit camp at Mechelen.&lt;ref name=Steinberg216/&gt; The AJB played a major role in persuading Jews to turn up voluntarily for deportation, though whether they knew the fate awaiting the deportees is disputed.&lt;ref name=Maron/&gt; From 1942, following the assassination by the Resistance of Robert Holzinger, an AJB leader, confidence in the association declined and it was regarded with increasing suspicion.&lt;ref name=Yahil394/&gt;

After the war, the leaders of the AJB were tried and acquitted of complicity in the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=Maron/&gt;

===Radicalisation, 1941-42===
====Antwerp Pogrom====
On 14 April 1941, after watching the German propaganda film {{lang|de|''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der Ewige Jude]]''}}, Flemish paramilitaries from the {{lang|nl|''Volksverwering''}}, VNV and {{lang|nl|''[[Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen]]''}} began a [[pogrom]] in the city of Antwerp.&lt;ref name=Saerens192-3&gt;{{cite book|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|chapter=Antwerp's Attitudes towards the Jews from 1918–1940 and its Implications for the Period of Occupation|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|pages=192–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mob, armed with iron bars, attacked and burned two [[synagogue]]s in the city and threw the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] onto the street.&lt;ref name=Saerens192-3/&gt; They then attacked the home of Marcus Rottenburg, the town's chief [[rabbi]]. The police and fire brigade were summoned, but they were forbidden to intervene by the German authorities.&lt;ref name=Saerens192-3/&gt;

====Yellow badge====
[[File:Belgian yellow badge.gif|150px|thumb|The Belgian version of the Yellow Badge, compulsory from 1942]]

As in the rest of occupied Europe, compulsory wearing of the [[yellow badge]] was enforced from 27 May 1942.&lt;ref name=VanderWijngaert229&gt;{{cite book|last=Van der Wijngaert|first=Mark|chapter=The Belgian Catholics and the Jews during the Gemrna Occupation, 1940–1944|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian version of the badge depicted a black letter &quot;J&quot; (standing for &quot;''Juif''&quot; in French and &quot;''Jood''&quot; in Dutch) in the centre of a yellow [[star of David]]. The star had to be displayed prominently on all outer clothing when in public and there were harsh penalties for non-compliance. The decree sparked public outrage in Belgium.&lt;ref name=VanderWijngaert229/&gt; At great personal risk, the Belgian civil authorities in Brussels and Liège refused to distribute the badge, buying time for many Jews to go into hiding.&lt;ref name=JBH204-5/&gt;

The German authorities in Antwerp attempted to enforce the wearing of badges in 1940, but the policy was dropped when non-Jewish citizens protested and wore the armbands themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nazis in Belgium Revive Edict Imposing Yellow Badges on Jews|date=3 June 1942|newspaper=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|location=Zürich|url=http://www.jta.org/1942/06/03/archive/nazis-in-belgium-revive-edict-imposing-yellow-badges-on-jews|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deportation and extermination, 1942-44===
From August 1942, the Germans began deporting Jews, using {{lang|de|''[[Arbeitseinsatz]]''}} (&quot;recruitment for work&quot;) in German factories as a pretext.&lt;ref name=Yahil394&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahil|first=Leni|title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932–1945|series=Studies in Jewish History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|location=Oxford|edition=Reprint (trans.)|isbn=0-19-504523-8|page=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around half of the Jews turned up voluntarily (though coerced by the German authorities) for transportation although round-ups were begun in late July. Later in the war, the Germans increasingly relied on the police to arrest or round up Jews by force.&lt;ref name=Saerens207&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|title=Insa Meinen: the Persecution of the Jews in Belgium through a German Lens|journal=Journal of Belgian History (RBHC-BTNG)|volume=XLII|issue=4|year=2012|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first convoy from Belgium, carrying [[Statelessness|stateless]] Jews, left [[Mechelen transit camp]] for [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] on 4 August 1942 and was soon followed by others.&lt;ref name=Yahil393/&gt; These trains left for extermination camps in Eastern Europe. Between October 1942 and January 1943, deportations were temporarily halted;&lt;ref name=Yahil435/&gt; by this time 16,600 people have been deported on 17 rail convoys.&lt;ref name=Yahil394/&gt; As the result of [[Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium|Queen Elisabeth]]'s intervention with the German authorities, all of those deported in this first wave were not Belgian citizens.&lt;ref name=Yahil435/&gt; In 1943, the deportations resumed. By the time that deportations to extermination camps had begun, however, nearly 2,250 Belgian Jews had already been deported as forced laborers for {{lang|de|''[[Organisation Todt]]''}}, a civil and military engineering group, which was working on the construction of the [[Atlantic Wall]] in Northern France.&lt;ref name=Yahil393/&gt;

In September, armed {{lang|de|''[[Devisenschutzkommando]]''}} (DSK; &quot;Currency protection command&quot;) units raided homes to seize valuables and personal belongings as the occupants were preparing to report to the transit camp, and in the same month, Jews with Belgian citizenship were deported for the first time.&lt;ref name=Yahil435/&gt; DSK units relied on networks of informants, who were paid between 100 and 200 Belgian francs for each person they betrayed.&lt;ref name=Saerens210&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|title=Insa Meinen: the Persecution of the Jews in Belgium through a German Lens|journal=Journal of Belgian History (RBHC-BTNG)|volume=XLII|issue=4|year=2012|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the collaborator Felix Lauterborn stated in his trial that 80 per cent of arrests in Antwerp used information from paid informants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|title=De Jodenjagers van de Vlaamse SS|isbn=90-209-7384-3|year=2008|publisher=Lannoo|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 6,000 Jews were deported in 1943, with another 2,700 in 1944.

The percentages of Jews which were deported varied by location.

==Belgian collaboration in the Holocaust==
[[File:Circular describing the Belgian anti-jewish laws of October 1940.jpg|170px|thumb|Internal civil service circular outlining the anti-Jewish laws of October 1940]]
Members of Belgian fascist political parties actively attempted to assist in the deportation of Jews. The VNV and {{lang|nl|''Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen''}} encouraged the deportations, while an association known as {{lang|fr|''La Défense du Peuple''}}/{{lang|nl|''Volksverwering''}} (&quot;The People's Defence&quot;) was specially formed to bring together Belgian anti-Semites and to assist in the deportations.&lt;ref name=Saerens212-4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|title=Insa Meinen: the Persecution of the Jews in Belgium through a German Lens|journal=Journal of Belgian History (RBHC-BTNG)|volume=XLII|issue=4|year=2012|pages=212–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early stages of the occupation, they campaigned for harsher anti-Jewish laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strict Anti-Jewish Laws in Belgium Demanded|url=http://www.jta.org/1941/06/15/archive/strict-anti-jewish-laws-in-belgium-demanded|newspaper=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=15 June 1941|location=London|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both {{lang|fr|''Rex''}} and the VNV routinely published anti-Semitic articles in their party newspapers.&lt;ref name=Saerens212-4/&gt;

Although the Belgian civil authorities (especially the police and security service) were officially forbidden to assist the German authorities in anything other than routine maintenance of order, several incidents occurred where individual policemen or police sections assisted in the German arrest of Jews, against orders.&lt;ref name=Saerens206&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|title=Insa Meinen: the Persecution of the Jews in Belgium through a German Lens|journal=Journal of Belgian History (RBHC-BTNG)|volume=XLII|issue=4|year=2012|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Antwerp, the Belgian authorities facilitated the conscription of Jews for forced labour in France in 1941&lt;ref name=Saerens207/&gt; and aided in the rounding up of Jews in August 1942 after the {{lang|de|''SiPo-SD''}} threatened to imprison local officials in [[Fort Breendonk]].&lt;ref name=Saerens206/&gt; Outside Antwerp, the Germans used coercion to force the Belgian police to intervene, and in Brussels at least three police officers disobeyed orders and helped arrest Jews.&lt;ref name=Saerens206/&gt; The historian Insa Meinen argued that around a fifth of the Jews arrested in Belgium were rounded up by the Belgian police.&lt;ref name=Saerens207/&gt;

Nevertheless, the general refusal of the Belgian police to assist in the Holocaust has been cited as a reason for the comparatively high survival rate of Belgian Jews during the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=Saerens206/&gt;

==Belgian opposition to Jewish persecution==
{{see also|Belgian Resistance}}
Belgian resistance to the treatment of Jews crystallised between August–September 1942, following the passing of legislation regarding wearing yellow badges and the start of the deportations.&lt;ref name=Gotovich274&gt;{{cite book|last=Gotovich|first=José|chapter=Resistance Movements and the Jewish Question|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; When deportations began, Jewish partisans destroyed records of Jews compiled by the AJB.&lt;ref name=Yahil394/&gt; The first organization specifically devoted to hiding Jews, the {{lang|fr|''[[Comité de Défense des Juifs]]''}} (CDJ-JVD), was formed in the summer of 1942.&lt;ref name=Gotovich274/&gt; The CDJ, a [[left-wing]] organization, may have saved up to 4,000 children and 10,000 adults by finding them safe hiding places.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; It produced two [[Yiddish language]] underground newspapers, ''Unzer Wort'' ({{lang|yi|אונזער-ווארט}}, &quot;Our Word&quot;, with a [[Labor Zionism|Labour-Zionist]] stance) and ''Unzer Kamf'' ({{lang|yi|אונזער קאמף}}, &quot;Our Fight&quot;, with a [[Communism|Communist]] one).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Préface|author=Various|title=Partisans Armés Juifs, 38 Témoignages.|url=http://www.getuigen.be/Getuigenis/3den/enfants-partisans-juifs/tkst.htm|year=1991|location=Brussels|publisher=Les Enfants des Partisans Juifs de Belgique}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDJ was only one of dozens of organised resistance groups that provided support to hidden Jews. Other groups and individual resistance members were responsible for finding hiding places and providing food and forged papers.&lt;ref name=Yahil436&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahil|first=Leni|title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932–1945|series=Studies in Jewish History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|location=Oxford|edition=Reprint (trans.)|isbn=0-19-504523-8|page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Jews in hiding went on to join organised resistance groups. Groups from left wing backgrounds, like the {{lang|fr|''[[Front de l'Indépendance]]''}} (FI-OF), were particularly popular with Belgian Jews. The Communist-inspired {{lang|fr|''[[Partisans Armés]]''}} (PA) had a particularly large Jewish section in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gotovich|first=José|chapter=Resistance Movements and the Jewish Question|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|pages=281–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resistance was responsible for the assassination of Robert Holzinger, the head of the deportation program, in 1942.&lt;ref name=Yahil393/&gt; Holzinger, an active collaborator, was an Austrian Jew selected by the Germans for the role.&lt;ref name=Yahil393/&gt; The assassination led to a change in leadership of the AJB. Five Jewish leaders, including the head of the AJB, were arrested and interned in Breendonk, but were released after public outcry.&lt;ref name=Yahil394/&gt; A sixth was deported directly to Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=Yahil394/&gt;

The Belgian resistance was unusually well informed on the fate of the deported Jews. In August 1942 (two months after the start of the Belgian deportations), the underground newspaper {{lang|nl|''De Vrijschutter''}} reported that &quot;They [the deported Jews] are being killed in groups by gas, and others are killed by salvos of machinegun fire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schreiber|first=Marion|title=The Twentieth Train: the True Story of the Ambush of the Death Train to Auschwitz|year=2003|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8021-1766-3|edition=1st US|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1943, the {{lang|fr|''Front de l'Indépendance''}} sent [[Victor Martin]], an academic economist at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Louvain]], to gather information on the fate of deported Belgian Jews using the cover of his research post at the [[University of Cologne]].&lt;ref name=Scheriber73-5/&gt; Martin visited Auschwitz and witnessed the crematoria. Arrested by the Germans, he escaped, and was able to report his findings to the CDJ in May 1943.&lt;ref name=Scheriber73-5&gt;{{cite book|last=Schreiber|first=Marion|title=The Twentieth Train: the True Story of the Ambush of the Death Train to Auschwitz|year=2003|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8021-1766-3|edition=1st US|pages=73–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Attack on the twentieth convoy}}
The best-known Belgian resistance action during the Holocaust was the attack on the 20th rail convoy to Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=Yahil435&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahil|first=Leni|title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932–1945|series=Studies in Jewish History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|location=Oxford|edition=Reprint (trans.)|isbn=0-19-504523-8|page=435}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening of 19 April 1943, three poorly armed members of the resistance attacked the railway convoy as it passed near [[Haacht]] in [[Flemish Brabant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schreiber|first=Marion|title=The Twentieth Train: the True Story of the Ambush of the Death Train to Auschwitz|year=2003|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8021-1766-3|edition=1st US|pages=220–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The train, containing over 1,600 Jews, was guarded by 16 Germans from the {{lang|de|''SiPo-SD''}}.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; Resistance members used a lantern covered with red paper (a danger signal) to stop the train, and freed 17 prisoners from one wagon before they were discovered by the Germans.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Althea|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Sarah|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22188075 | title=Escaping the train to Auschwitz|work=[[BBC News]]|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further 200 managed to jump from the train later in the journey, as the train's Belgian driver deliberately kept his speed low to allow others to escape.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; All three resistance members responsible for the attack were arrested before the end of the occupation. Youra Livchitz was executed and Jean Franklemon and Robert Maistriau were deported to concentration camps but survived the war.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

The attack on the 20th train was the only attack on a Holocaust train from Belgium during the war, as well as the only transport from Belgium to experience a mass breakout.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

===Passive resistance===
The treatment of Jews by the Germans led to public resistance in Belgium. In June 1942, the representative of the German [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Ministry]] in Brussels, Werner von Bargen, complained the Belgians did not exhibit &quot;sufficient understanding&quot; of Nazi racial policy.&lt;ref name=Yahil393/&gt;

The Belgian underground newspaper {{lang|fr|''[[La Libre Belgique during World War II|La Libre Belgique]]''}} called for Belgian citizens to make small gestures to show their disgust at the Nazi racial policy. In August 1942, the paper called for Belgians to &quot;Greet them [the Jews] in passing! Offer them your seat on the tram! Protest against the barbaric measures that are being applied to them. That'll make the ''[[Germans|Boches]]'' furious!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Libre Belgique. 01-08-1942|url=http://warpress.cegesoma.be/en/node/42539|series=Belgian War Press|publisher=Cegesoma|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination against Jews was condemned by many high-profile figures in the occupied country. As early as October 1940, the senior Catholic clergyman in Belgium, Cardinal [[Jozef-Ernest van Roey]], condemned the German policy and particularly the legislation from 1942.&lt;ref name=Saerens156&gt;{{cite book|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|chapter=The Attitudes of the Belgian Roman Catholic Clergy towards Jews prior to the Occupation|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Roey made many of the church's resources available for hiding Jews, but was prevented from publicly condemning the treatment of the Jews by his peers, who feared a Nazi repression of the Church. German attempts to involve the Belgian authorities and local government in its implementation began to arouse protest from 1942. The Committee of Secretary-Generals, a panel of Belgian senior civil servants tasked with implementing German demands, refused from the outset to enforce anti-Jewish legislation.&lt;ref name=Gotovich410&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gotovitch| editor1-first=José| editor2-last=Aron|editor2-first=Paul|title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique|year=2008|publisher=André Versaille éd.|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87495-001-8|pages=412–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1942, a conference of the 19 mayors of the Greater Brussels region refused to allow its officials to distribute yellow badges to Jews in their districts.&lt;ref name=JBH204-5&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saerens|first=Lieven|title=Insa Meinen: the Persecution of the Jews in Belgium through a German Lens|journal=Journal of Belgian History (RBHC-BTNG)|volume=XLII|issue=4|year=2012|pages=204–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At great personal risk, the mayors, led by [[Joseph Van De Meulebroeck]], sent a letter protesting the decree to the German authorities on 5 June.&lt;ref name=JBH204-5/&gt; The refusal of Brussels' council, and later that of the city of Liège, to distribute badges allowed many Jews to go into hiding before the deportations began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahil|first=Leni|title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932–1945|series=Studies in Jewish History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|location=Oxford|edition=Reprint (trans.)|isbn=0-19-504523-8|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, members of the AJB met with Queen Elisabeth to appeal for her support against the deportations. She appealed to the Military Governor of Belgium, General [[Alexander von Falkenhausen]], who sent [[Eggert Reeder]], his deputy and head of the non-military aspects of the administration, to Berlin to clarify the policy with {{lang|de|''[[Reichsführer-SS]]''}} [[Heinrich Himmler]]. The {{lang|de|''[[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]''}} (RSHA; &quot;Reich Main Security Office&quot;) made concessions to Elisabeth, allowing Jews with Belgian citizenship to be exempt from deportation, and Jewish families would not be broken up.&lt;ref name=Yahil393&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahil|first=Leni|title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932–1945|series=Studies in Jewish History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|location=Oxford|edition=Reprint (trans.)|isbn=0-19-504523-8|page=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RSHA also agreed not to deport Jewish men over the age of 65 and women over 60, after Belgian protests that they would be too old to be used as forced labor.&lt;ref name=Yahil393/&gt;

==Legacy and remembrance==
In the aftermath of the war, emigration to Israel further decreased the Jewish population of Belgium, which as of 2011 was estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000.&lt;ref name=LeVif2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rogeau|first1=Olivier|last2=Royen|first2=Marie-Cécile|title=Juifs de Belgique|url=http://www.kuleuven.be/thomas/images/algemeen/actualiteit/tijdschriften/acjcb/communaute_juive_LV_28_01_2011.pdf|newspaper=[[Le Vif]]|publisher=[[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]|date=28 January 2011|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population is still concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp, but new smaller communities (such as those in [[Ghent]], [[Knokke]], [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] and [[Arlon]]) have developed since 1945.&lt;ref name=LeVif2/&gt; Notable Belgian Holocaust survivors include [[François Englert]], a joint recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2013, and [[Paul M.
