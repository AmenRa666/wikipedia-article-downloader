'''52nd (London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment''' was a volunteer air defence unit of Britain's [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] from 1922 until 1961. In [[World War II]] it defended London during [[The Blitz]] and later served in the [[Burma Campaign]].

==Origin==
[[File:SaatchiGallery.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Duke of York's Headquarters]]]]
[[German strategic bombing during World War I|German air raids]] by [[Zeppelin]] airships and [[Gotha G.IV|Gotha]] bombers on London and other British cities during [[World War I]] had shown the need for strong anti-aircraft (AA) defences in any future war. When the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) was reformed in 1922 it included a number of dedicated AA units of the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA). The second of these was '''52nd (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade''', [[Royal Garrison Artillery]], comprising 154th (London), 155th (London) and 156th (Barking) AA Batteries. The Regimental Headquarters, 154 and 155 Batteries were at the [[Duke of York's Headquarters]] in [[Chelsea, London]], while 156 Battery was based at Empress Hall, Ripple Lane, [[Barking]].&lt;ref name = Litchfield&gt;Litchfield, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BMH1&gt;[http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/1-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1936-38-.pdf 1 AA Division 1936–39 at British Military History]&lt;/ref&gt; It formed part of [[26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade|26th (London) Air Defence Brigade]] also headquartered at the Duke of York's Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.slv.vic.gov.au/view/action/singleViewer.do?dvs=1392113637069~863&amp;locale=en_US&amp;metadata_object_ratio=10&amp;show_metadata=true&amp;preferred_usage_type=VIEW_MAIN&amp;frameId=1&amp;usePid1=true&amp;usePid2=true ''Titles and Designations'' 1927.]&lt;/ref&gt; The original TA AA units were formed on a low peacetime establishment with a few old [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch guns]] on static mounts.&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RA badge at DOYHQ.JPG|thumb|left|Badge of the [[Royal Artillery]] above a door at a building of the former [[Duke of York's Headquarters]] in [[Chelsea, London]]]]
As Britain's AA defences expanded during the 1930s, higher formations became necessary, and the  26th AD Bde (now renamed 26th (London) AA Group), including 52nd AA Bde, was assigned to  [[1st Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|1st AA Division]] organised to cover London and the [[Home Counties]]. The Royal Garrison Artillery had been absorbed into the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA) in 1924; in 1938 the RA replaced its traditional unit designation 'Brigade' by the modern 'Regiment', and the 'AA Groups' reverted to the more usual formation title of 'Brigades'. [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] was formed in April 1939 to control all the TA's AA units and formations.&lt;ref name = Litchfield/&gt;&lt;ref name = BMH1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/documents.php?aid=7&amp;nid=1&amp;start=5 AA Command at British Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1938, RHQ, 154 and 155 Batteries had moved from Chelsea to Artillery House, Horn Lane, in [[Acton, London|Acton]], and were joined by a new 271 AA Battery based at [[Brentford]], replacing 156 (Barking) Battery, which had become part of a new [[82nd (Essex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment|82nd (Essex) AA Regiment]]&lt;ref name = BMH1/&gt;&lt;ref name = List&gt;''Monthly Army List'' January 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobilisation==
The TA's AA units were [[Mobilisation|mobilised]] on 23 September 1938 during the [[Munich Crisis]]. The call-out of key parties by telephone and telegram went well, and they assembled at their drill halls within a few hours. Because the units possessed only a small scale of transport, elaborate plans had been made to requisition civilian vehicles, ranging from heavy lorries to buses and private cars. Equipment was drawn from mobilisation stores, and the detachments ferried out to their war stations. Despite some failures and problems, the emergency positions covering London were manned and most of the equipment was in place within 24 hours. The emergency mobilisation lasted nearly three weeks before the TA units were released on 14 October.&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, pp. 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deterioration in international relations during 1939 led to a partial mobilisation in June, and a proportion of TA AA units manned their war stations under a rotation system known as 'Couverture'. Full mobilisation of AA Command came on 28 August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
On mobilisation, 52 AA Regiment was assigned to a newly formed [[49th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|49 AA Bde]] in London. At that time it included a new 313 AA Battery forming at Brentford; this battery later served with the Regular [[4th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment]] in West Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriotfiles.com/index.php?name=Sections&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=6697&amp;page=1 AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/1-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1939-.pdf 1 AA Division 1939 at British Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = RA&gt;[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page15.html 52 HAA Rgt at RA 39–45]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Blitz===
[[File:Hyde Park Anti-aircraft guns H 993.jpg|thumb|3.7 inch gun in London in 1939.]]
In the summer of 1940, along with other AA units equipped with the older [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] and newer [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch]] AA guns, the 52nd was designated a Heavy AA Regiment.&lt;ref name = Litchfield/&gt; By the time of the [[Battle of Britain]] and during [[The Blitz]], 52 HAA Regt had returned to 26 AA Bde in 1 AA Division, defending London.&lt;ref name = RA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/home/page48.html 1 AA Div at RA 39–45] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020032748/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/home/page48.html |date=October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BMH40&gt;[http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/1-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1940-.pdf 1 AA Division 1940 at British Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farndale, Annex D, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceylon===
The regiment remained with 1 AA Division until March 1942, when it joined the [[War Office]] Reserve&lt;ref&gt;Farndale, Annex H, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, 17 March 1942 Amendments, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]], files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883.&lt;/ref&gt; and then embarked for [[Ceylon]], arriving at [[Colombo]] on 28 May and moving to [[Trincomalee]] a month later.&lt;ref name = RA/&gt;&lt;ref name = BMH40/&gt;&lt;ref name = Joslen519&gt;Joslen, p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt; 154 (London) Battery was stationed with [[East Africa Command]] in November 1942,&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 1943 joined [[56th (Cornwall) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|56 (Cornwall) HAA Regt]] in Ceylon. In its place, 52 HAA Regt received 159 (Lloyds) Battery from [[53rd (City of London)  Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|53 (City of London) HAA Regt]]. 52 HAA Regt came under the command of [[23rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|23 AA Bde]], while 155 and 271 Btys were at different times detached to [[24th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|24 AA Bde]]&lt;ref name = RA/&gt;&lt;ref name = BMH40/&gt;&lt;ref name = Joslen519/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page16.html 56 HAA Rgt at RA 39–45]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, Table XXXVIII, pp. 253–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burma===
On 23 November 1944, 52 HAA Regt embarked again and crossed to India to take part in the [[Burma Campaign 1944–1945|reconquest of Burma]]. It spent the whole of December travelling to [[Palel]] in [[Manipur]] on the Burmese border, where it came under [[XXXIII Corps (British India)|XXXIII Corps]] in [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] to join in the advance across the [[Chindwin River]].&lt;ref name = RA/&gt;&lt;ref name = BMH40/&gt;&lt;ref name = Joslen519/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, Table XXXIX, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assigned to [[11th (East Africa) Division]], it moved east from [[Imphal]] to [[Tamu, Myanmar|Tamu]] and down the 'pestilential' [[Kabaw Valley]] to the Chindwin to meet [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th (Indian) Division]] at [[Kalemyo]]. 11th EA Division with its AA support then moved north up the Chindwin to [[Kalewa]], an important ferry centre which was to be the crossing site for XXXIII Corps. A bridgehead was secured and the engineers began building a 1100-foot [[Bailey bridge]] on pontoons. Japanese air attacks had been slight up to this point, but now their aircraft made a determined attempt to knock out the bridge. Intense concentrations of fire by 52nd and the other AA units broke up the attacks, destroyed six aircraft, and ensured that the bridge remained intact.&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, pp. 245–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As XXXIII Corps launched its main drive from Kalewa in December, 52 HAA Rgt remained behind to defend the bridgehead area, later moving up to guard the line of communications as the Corps advanced towards [[Mandalay]] in January 1945. During the approach to Mandalay, the Corps HAA guns were frequently used as Corps medium artillery, bombarding enemy positions. Late in 1944, 52nd HAA Rgt had acquired a section of [[7.2-inch howitzer]]s to operate in this role, for which it had to find the detachments, command posts and observation post parties for this unfamiliar duty.&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, pp. 244, 247–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The important airfield at Meiktila was captured by IV Corps on 20 February and turned into a defended 'box' against enemy counter-attacks, and 52nd HAA Rgt was transferred from XXXIII to [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]], with 271 Bty moving in to reinforce the box.&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, p. 248, Table XL, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the British advance gained momentum, IV Corps' two divisions, 5th and [[17th Infantry Division (India)|17th (Indian)]], began leap-frogging forwards. 155 and 271 Batteries of 52nd HAA Rgt accompanied 5th Division, while 159 Bty went with 17th Division. The HAA guns were mainly used in the ground role, but when the advance reached Payagyi and [[Bago, Myanmar|Pegu]], only 70 miles from [[Yangon|Rangoon]], the airfield complex and the bridge over the [[Sittang River]] required AA cover, for which 271 Bty was deployed against small and scattered air raids.
&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rangoon fell in early May, 24th AA Bde took over responsibility for its air defence, and 52nd HAA Rgt deployed its 24 3.7-inch guns to defend the  docks, airfield and oil installations. It remained there when 24 AA Bde was replaced by  [[3rd Indian Anti-Aircraft Brigade|3 Indian AA Bde]] in June. The AA defence role at Rangoon ended in September 1945 and 52nd HAA Rgt was withdrawn. All the British regiments were on their way home by October.&lt;ref name = Joslen519/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, pp. 250–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regiment's former 154 (London) HAA Battery had been converted into Medium Artillery (as 63 Medium Battery) in July 1944 and assigned to [[87th Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery|87 Medium Regt]]. It remained in Burma when the rest of 87 Medium Regt returned to India, and on 17 August 1945 it rejoined 52 HAA Regt.&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, pp. 512, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==
The regiment was reconstituted in the TA in 1947 as '''452 (London) HAA Regiment''' at Acton in [[41st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|67 AA Bde]] (the prewar 41 AA Bde). In 1954 it absorbed [[54th (London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|454 (City of London) HAA Regiment]], and the following year amalgamated with [[53rd (City of London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|453/488 (City of London)]] and [[London Scottish (regiment)|497 (Hammersmith)]] HAA Regiments in [[33rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|33 AA Bde]]. The combined regiment retained the number 452, with the following organisation:&lt;ref name = Litchfield/&gt;&lt;ref name = BMH1/&gt;&lt;ref name = 45on&gt;[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/444-473-regiments.html 444–473 Regiments at British Army units from 1945 on]&lt;/ref&gt;
* RHQ Battery – ''from 453/488 HAA''
* P (Middlesex) Battery – ''from 452 HAA''
* Q (Lloyds City of London Battery) – ''from 454 HAA''
* R (Hammersmith) Battery – ''from 497 HAA''

In 1961 the regiment amalgamated again with [[7th London Artillery|264 (7th London) Field Regiment]], [[City of London Artillery|290 (City of London) Field Regiment]] and [[London Heavy Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery|353 (London) Medium Regiment]] to form [[City of London Artillery|254 (City of London) Field Regiment]], when the 52nd Anti-Aircraft lineage ended.&lt;ref name = Litchfield/&gt;&lt;ref name = 45on/&gt;

==Honorary Colonel==
The motor manufacturer and philanthropist [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield]] was appointed Honorary Colonel of 52 (London) AA Regiment on 4 June 1937 and continued that role with 452 HAA Regiment.&lt;ref name = List/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Burke's''.&lt;/ref&gt;
