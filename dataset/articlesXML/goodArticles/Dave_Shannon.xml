'''David John (Dave) Shannon''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] &amp; [[Medal bar|Bar]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] &amp; Bar (27 May 1922&amp;nbsp;– 8&amp;nbsp;April 1993) was an Australian bomber pilot of World War&amp;nbsp;II, best known for his part in the [[Operation Chastise|&quot;Dambusters&quot; raid]] on the night of 16/17&amp;nbsp;May 1943. Born in [[South Australia]], he joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in 1941 and learned to fly under the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. After further training in the United Kingdom he was posted to [[No. 106 Squadron RAF]], operating [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers, and was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) in January 1943. In March he was selected by No.&amp;nbsp;106 Squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander [[Guy Gibson]], to join the newly formed [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;617 Squadron]] for [[Operation Chastise]], the attack on the dams of the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr valley]]. Awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) following the raid, Shannon continued to fly with No.&amp;nbsp;617 Squadron until October 1944, during which time he earned [[Medal bar|bars]] to his DSO and DFC. He was then assigned to transport duties, first with [[No. 511 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;511 Squadron]] and then, in March 1945, with [[No. 246 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;246 Squadron]]. Ranked [[squadron leader]], Shannon was [[Demobilization|demobilised]] after the war and remained in England, becoming an executive with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]. He died in [[South London]] in 1993, aged seventy.

Following graduation as a [[pilot officer]] in September, he was posted to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt;

==Active service==
Promoted to [[flying officer]] in March 1942, Shannon underwent conversion to [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley]] bombers at No.&amp;nbsp;19 Operational Training Unit in [[RAF Kinloss|Kinloss]], Scotland. He was then posted to [[No. 106 Squadron RAF]], operating [[Avro Lancaster]]s, and flew the first of his thirty-six [[sortie]]s with the unit in June.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] on 12&amp;nbsp;January 1943 for &quot;attacks on industrial targets in enemy territory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068967/RCDIG1068967--221-.JPG |title=Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35858|supp=yes|startpage=268|endpage=269|date=12 January 1943 |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;In March he was selected by No.&amp;nbsp;106 Squadron's former commanding officer, Wing Commander [[Guy Gibson]], to join the newly formed [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;617 Squadron]] for [[Operation Chastise]], the &quot;Dambusters&quot; raid on the dams of the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt; Shannon was one of four Australian pilots in the squadron—the others being [[Harold Brownlow Martin|&quot;Micky&quot; Martin]], Robert Barlow, and [[Les Knight]]—and, at twenty, the youngest captain from among all the crews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mail&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Veitch|first=Alan|title=Dambusters' Anzac legend|work=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]]|url= http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/sunday-mail/dambusters-anzac-legend/story-e6frep2o-1111112291891|date=1 October 2006|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cultivated a moustache in an attempt to add maturity to his baby face.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;

On the night of Operation Chastise, 16/17&amp;nbsp;May 1943, Shannon was among a group of Lancasters led by Gibson in assaults on the [[Möhne Reservoir|Möhne]] and [[Edersee Dam|Eder Dams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt; After five of the aircraft had dropped their bouncing bombs on the Möhne, Shannon was preparing to make his attack on the dam when it gave way, so he carried on to the Eder with Gibson and three other Lancasters, captained by [[Dinghy Young|&quot;Dinghy&quot; Young]], Henry Maudsley, and Les Knight.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, ''The Dambusters Raid'', pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed for the first bombing run at the Eder, Shannon took several attempts to familiarise himself with the area and line up his aircraft, so in the meantime Gibson ordered Maudsley to make his attack. Shannon went in next, delivering his bomb on target. Knight then dropped his bomb, and the dam broke.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, ''Bomber Boys'', pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon landed back at [[RAF Scampton]] feeling &quot;terribly elated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, ''The Dambusters Raid'', p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; His bomb was believed to have caused a crack in the dam's wall, while Knight's completed the breach.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, ''The Dambusters Raid'', pp. 217–218&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking later of the severe losses suffered by the squadron—eight out of nineteen planes—Shannon contended, &quot;I suppose we had become hardened to loss&amp;nbsp;– we could shrug it off. We had to, otherwise we could never have flown again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, ''Dambusters: A Landmark Oral History'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his part in the mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068967/RCDIG1068967--219-.JPG|title= Recommendation: Distinguished Service Order|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of several decorations awarded to the aircrew of No.&amp;nbsp;617 Squadron for the dams raid and promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' under the citation:&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36030|supp=yes|startpage=2361|endpage=2362|date=28 May 1943 |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|On the night of 16th May, 1943, a force of Lancaster bombers was detailed to attack the Moehne, Eder and Sorpe dams in Germany. The operation was one of great difficulty and hazard, demanding a high degree of skill and courage and close co-operation between the crews of the aircraft engaged. Nevertheless, a telling blow was struck at the enemy by the successful breaching of the Mohne and Eder dams. This outstanding success reflects the greatest credit on the efforts of the following personnel who participated in the operation in various capacities as members of aircraft crew.}}

Soon after the raid, Shannon married a [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]], [[Flying Officer|Section Officer]] Ann Fowler, whom he met at Scampton before the raid.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, ''The Dambusters Raid'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; He remained with No.&amp;nbsp;617 Squadron while its role as a special-duties unit operating against high-value targets was expanded, participating in attacks on canals and [[V-weapon]] sites with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]]. Shannon was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 23&amp;nbsp;September 1943 and awarded a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his DFC on 12&amp;nbsp;November for a &quot;low level attack in adverse weather against heavy opposition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068967/RCDIG1068967--220-.JPG |title=Recommendation: Bar to Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36245|supp=yes|startpage=4971|endpage=4972|date=12 November 1943 |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again participated in raids against V-weapon sites in January 1944. The following month, No.&amp;nbsp;617 Squadron undertook its first sortie under the leadership of Wing Commander [[Leonard Cheshire]]. At this point the unit began flying low-level target-marking missions using [[de Havilland Mosquito]] light bombers as well as Lancasters. Shannon converted to the Mosquito and started flying it operationally in April. He returned to the Lancaster on 5&amp;nbsp;June to drop &quot;[[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|Window]]&quot; as a part of the Allies' diversions ahead of the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]] the following day, prior to again flying Mosquitos against V-weapon sites and in support of the Normandy invasion forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt;

Though &quot;outwardly nerveless&quot;, according to military historian Patrick Bishop, Shannon was not immune to dread feelings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bishop219&quot;&gt;Bishop, ''Bomber Boys'', p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; As they prepared to depart on one of their night missions, Cheshire commented on the beautiful sunset, to which Shannon replied, &quot;I don't give a fuck about that, I want to see the sunrise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bishop219&quot;/&gt; Having been raised to acting [[squadron leader]], he was awarded a bar to his DSO on 26&amp;nbsp;September 1944 for &quot;courage of high order on numerous sorties&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068967/RCDIG1068967--218-.JPG|title= Recommendation: Bar to Distinguished Service Order|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DSOBar&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36718|supp=yes|startpage=4441|date=26 September 1944 |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full citation in the ''London Gazette'' read:&lt;ref name=&quot;DSOBar&quot;/&gt;
{{quote|Since the award of a bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross, Squadron Leader Shannon has completed many sorties which he has executed with outstanding resolution and success. He has at all times displayed courage and fortitude of a high order and his appreciation of the responsibilities entrusted to him have set a fine example to all.}}

In October 1944, after a total of sixty-nine sorties, Shannon was taken off bomber operations and transferred to transport duties, initially with [[No. 511 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;511 Squadron]], which flew long-range missions with [[Avro York]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/511squadron.cfm |title=511 Squadron|publisher= [[Royal Air Force]]|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His promotion to squadron leader became substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1945. Three months later he was assigned to [[No. 246 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;246 Squadron]], which operated Yorks and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated Liberator]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/246squadron.cfm |title=246 Squadron|publisher= Royal Air Force|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon was discharged from the RAAF as a squadron leader on 15&amp;nbsp;December 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot;/&gt; He remained in England and became an executive with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and later [[Cunard Line|Cunard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nikki&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Blenkin|first=Max|title=Dam Buster medals on display in Canberra|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|url= http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/deam-buster-medals-on-display-in-canberra-20090703-d7hh.html |date=3 July 2009|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon no longer flew after the war, but did like to drive fast cars. He also served as chairman of the No.&amp;nbsp;617 Squadron Association, helping to raise funds for the Dambusters memorial at [[Woodhall Spa]] near RAF Scampton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nikki&quot;/&gt; His wife Ann died in 1990, and he married Eyke Taylor.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-david-shannon-2322037.html#|last=Crossland|first=John|title=Obituary: David Shannon|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=9 May 1993|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8&amp;nbsp;April 1993, shortly before a planned fiftieth anniversary reunion of surviving Dambusters, Dave Shannon died at his home in [[Sydenham]], South London, aged seventy.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hell&gt;Woods, ''Halfway to Hell'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the nine pilots who took part in the first wave of the dams raid, he was survived by his second wife and his daughter by Ann.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hell/&gt;
