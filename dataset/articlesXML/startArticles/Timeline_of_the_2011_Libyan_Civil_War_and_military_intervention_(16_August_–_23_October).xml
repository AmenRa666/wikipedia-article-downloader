The [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] began on 17 February 2011 as a civil protest and later evolved into a widespread uprising. By mid-August, [[anti-Gaddafi forces]] effectively supported by a [[NATO]]-led [[2011 military intervention in Libya|international coalition]] were ascendant in [[Tripolitania]], breaking out of the restive [[Nafusa Mountains]] in the south to mount an [[2011 Libyan rebel coastal offensive|offensive toward the coast]] and [[Battle of the Misrata frontline|advancing]] from [[Misrata]] on loyalist-held cities and villages from the north and east.

This period of the war was its endgame, with [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s defensive perimeter around [[Tarabulus District|Greater Tripoli]] collapsing and his government ultimately being [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|routed]] from [[Tripoli]]. A number of members of the Gaddafi government were arrested or [[killed in action]], including Gaddafi's youngest son [[Khamis Gaddafi|Khamis]], and a string of its last outposts teetered and eventually fell under the assault of the (effectively) NATO-backed revolutionaries. By the end of September, the [[National Transitional Council]] had won recognition from the United Nations, the [[Arab League]], and the [[African Union]] as the legitimate governing authority of [[Libya]], asserting control over the vast majority of the country.

As the war entered its momentous final days, the last remaining stronghold of government loyalists was the city of [[Sirte]], which Gaddafi declared to be the [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]]'s new capital after the fall of Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From voice said to be Gadhafi, a defiant message to his foes|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/09/01/libya.war/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=CNN|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October, NTC forces that had been arrayed around the ever-shrinking positions occupied by loyalist holdouts made a [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|decisive push]] and took control of the city, capturing Gaddafi as he attempted to flee. Gaddafi, who had been seriously wounded prior to his arrest, died in custody less than an hour later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111020111520869621.html|agency=Al Jazeera English|title=Muammar Gaddafi killed in Sirte}}&lt;/ref&gt;
