The USA has these types of [[frogmen]] and other armed forces [[diving|diver]]s:

==United States Navy==
* [[Underwater Demolition Team]]s (UDT's) – The first American frogmen (later became SEALs).
* [[United States Navy SEALs]] – primarily trained as Combat Swimmers/Divers.
* [[Naval Special Warfare Center]] trains the SEALs and some of the combat swimmers for the other U.S. military branches.
* [[United States Navy SpecOp]] (based in [[Indian Head, Maryland]]) is a naval unit which trains and supports divers and develops dive equipment for neutralizing [[naval mine|mines]] and removing submerged [[unexploded ordnance]].
* [[United States Navy Diver]]s (non-combat swimmers) – underwater [[welding]], ship husbandry, underwater construction, harbor clearing (except for explosive ordnance), and other &quot;underwater work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.com/about/navylife/onduty/navydiver/ |title=Navy Diver : Special Operations : Careers &amp; Jobs |publisher=Navy.com |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States Navy EOD|Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD) technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.com/about/navylife/onduty/eod/ |title=Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician : Special Operations : Careers &amp; Jobs |publisher=Navy.com |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Naval Special Clearance Team (NSCT)&lt;ref name=&quot;eodgru1.navy.mil&quot;&gt;http://www.eodgru1.navy.mil/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031065539/http://www.eodgru1.navy.mil/ |date=31 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit&lt;ref name=&quot;eodgru1.navy.mil&quot;/&gt;
* Underwater Construction Team (UCT) – trained primarily in use of [[surface demand|surface support]] equipment (&quot;hard hat&quot;) and some SCUBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.com/about/navylife/onduty/navydiver/navydiveunits/ |title=Navy Diver : Special Operations : Careers &amp; Jobs |publisher=Navy.com |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Army==
* Some [[United States Army|Army]] [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Rangers]] attend the Special Forces Combat Diver Qualification Course.
* [[Delta Force]] – all trained in Combat Swimming.
* [[Army engineer diver|Army Engineer Divers]] - Trained in underwater construction, salvage, demolitions, hydrographic survey, hyperbaric chamber operation, beach and river recon, bridge recon, underwater cutting and welding, side scan sonar operations, mine and countermine operations, search and recovery operations and ships husbandry operations. Army divers use both surface supplied &quot;Hard hat&quot; and scuba to perform their missions.
* The [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] (Green Berets) maintain a robust combat diving capability. One Operational Detachment-Alpha (ODA) per Special Forces Company is trained and equipped to conduct open and closed circuit sub-surface maritime infiltration operations. Special Forces combat divers, along with many [[Combat swimmer|combat divers]] from other services, attend the Special Forces Combat Diver Qualification Course, which is held at the Special Forces Underwater Operations School, [[Naval Air Station Key West]], [[Key West, Florida]].

==United States Marine Corps==
The [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[United States Marine Corps Combatant Diver Course|Combatant Diver Course]] is located at the [[Naval Support Activity Panama City#Tenant Commands|Navy Diving and Salvage Training Center]], [[Naval Support Activity Panama City]], [[Panama City, Florida]].

==United States Coast Guard==
According to Record Group 226 at the [[National Archive]] over 45 [[United States Coast Guard]] men were attached to the Office of Strategic Services Maritime Unit [[Operational Swimmer Groups]] (OSG). All OSGs had Coast Guard men, and several CG men were attached to UDT 10 in the Pacific after training with the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] MU. LT John P. Booth (USCG) was Commanding Officer in the field of OSG 1. He was attached to [[OSS Detachment 101]] and [[OSS Detachment 404]] in the China and Burma and India war area where he and his team conducted [[reconnaissance]] and [[infiltration tactics|infiltration]] by sea, scouted enemy shoreline, and participated in combat swimmer and covert operations. These OSS Frogmen pioneered the use of unassisted diving techniques to include the [[Lambertsen]] Unit (allowing men to swim underwater for up to 3 hours), [[swimfin]]s and the underwater [[compass]]. These men also experimented with underwater delivery systems referred to as the &quot;[[Sleeping Beauty (canoe)|Sleeping Beauty]]&quot;. Several of these Coast Guard/OSS Frogmen, including LT Booth, were awarded the Bronze Star for their &quot;service with the Office of Strategic Services&quot; by the Commanding General CBI. Although it is widely thought{{By whom|October 2010|date=October 2010}} that the Navy UDT's were the first Frogmen, in fact it was the combined efforts of the OSS Frogmen (Operational/Combat Swimmers), USN Scouts &amp; Raiders, and NCDUs/UDTs, that laid the foundation for what would later become the [[U.S. Navy SEALS]]. The first OSS Frogman, according to the Naval Special Warfare Foundation was USN Petty Officer John Spence who trained at OSS Maritime Unit AREA D on the [[Potomac River]] with USN LT Jack Taylor, who is widely considered the first SEAL. Over half of the OSS Frogmen / Combat swimmers were in fact Coast Guard men sought out for their advanced swimming, diving, and boat handing skills.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardianspies.com Guardian Spies: The Story of the U.S. Coast Guard and OSS in World War II&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2008 Qualified Coast Guard Officers and enlisted Petty Officers are permitted to volunteer for Navy SEAL training. 21 May 2010 two Coast Guard officers graduated BUDS class 277 and moved on to further Naval Special Warfare Training; ultimately to join active Navy SEAL teams. RADM Gary Bonelli, Deputy Commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command stated to the USCG Web journal the following:

“Naval Special Warfare is proud to team with the nation's first U.S. Coast Guard officers qualified as U.S. Navy SEALs...During the past fourteen months, they have proven their mettle and have truly earned the right to be called our teammates. Cooperation among all services is a critical component of the National Maritime Strategy. Today's graduation is just one more example of the many integral ties that bind our maritime services. Congratulations to SQT Class 277!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.uscg.dhs.gov/2010/05/navy-seal-graduation-first-coast-guard.html |title=iCommandant: Navy SEAL Graduation – First Coast Guard Graduates |publisher=Blog.uscg.dhs.gov |date=21 May 2010 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[United States Coast Guard]] dive teams are assigned to [[buoy tender]]s in the [[14th District]], polar [[icebreaker]]s, and [[Maritime Safety and Security Team]]s. At these units, divers perform a variety of missions, from buoy tending in the Central Pacific to science support in the polar regions and security diving operations in ports around the country.

==United States Air Force==
* [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Pararescue]] (PJ) and [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Combat Control]] (CCT) personnel of the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] are trained in both open and closed-circuit diving. They attend the Air Force Combat Dive Course during their training.
* Some [[US Air Force Tactical Air Control Party|Air Force Tactical Air Control Party]] (TACP) members and some [[Air Force Special Operations Weather Technician|Special Operations Weather Team]] (SOWT) members are SCUBA or Combat Diver qualified. Both they and PJ/CCT personnel are able to operate as members of Special Forces ODAs (see above) and Navy SEAL teams on diving operations, on missions requiring subsurface infiltration, and in other waterborne operations.
