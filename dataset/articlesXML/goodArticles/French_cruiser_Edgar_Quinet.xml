'''''Edgar Quinet''''' was an [[armored cruiser]] of the [[French Navy]], the [[lead ship]] of [[Edgar Quinet class armoured cruiser|her class]]. She and her [[sister ship]], {{ship|French cruiser|Waldeck-Rousseau||2}}, were the last class of armored cruiser to be built by the French Navy. ''Edgar Quinet'' was laid down in November 1905, launched in September 1907, and completed in January 1911. Armed with a main battery of fourteen {{convert|194|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} guns, she was more powerful than most other armored cruisers, but she had entered service more than two years after the first [[battlecruiser]]&amp;mdash;{{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}}&amp;mdash;had rendered armored cruisers obsolescent.

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, ''Edgar Quinet'' participated in the hunt for the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} and then joined the blockade of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in the Adriatic. She took part in the [[Battle of Antivari]] later in August, and the seizure of [[Corfu]] in January 1916, but saw no further action during the war. In 1922, she evacuated over a thousand civilians from [[Smyrna]] during the climax of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Greco-Turkish War]]. Converted into a training ship in the mid-1920s, ''Edgar Quinet'' ran aground on a rock off the Algerian coast on 4 January 1930 and sank five days later.

==Description==
{{main article|Edgar Quinet-class cruiser}}

''Edgar Quinet'' was {{convert|158.9|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|21.51|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.41|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|13847|MT|sp=us}}. Her power plant consisted of three [[triple-expansion engine]]s powered by forty coal-fired [[Belleville boiler]]s, which were trunked into six [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] in two groups of three. Her engines were rated at {{convert|36000|ihp|lk=in}} and produced a top speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. She had a crew of between 859 and 892 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=O192&gt;Osborne, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G307&gt;Gardiner, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

''Edgar Quinet'' was armed with a main battery of fourteen {{convert|194|mm|abbr=on}} 50-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] M1902 guns; four were in twin [[gun turret]]s forward and aft, with three single gun turrets on either [[broadside]]. The last four guns were mounted in [[casemate]]s abreast the main and aft [[conning tower]]s. Close-range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of twenty 9-pounder guns in casemates in the ship's hull. She was also equipped with two {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in the hull. She was protected with a [[belt armor|armored belt]] that was {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[amidships]]. The gun turrets had {{convert|200|mm|abbr=on}} thick plating, while the casemates had marginally thinner protection, at 194&amp;nbsp;mm. The main conning tower had 200&amp;nbsp;mm thick sides.&lt;ref name=O192/&gt;&lt;ref name=G307/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Edgar Quinet being launched.png|thumb|left|''Edgar Quinet'' at her launching]]

''Edgar Quinet'' was laid down at [[Brest, France|Brest]] in November 1905 and launched on 21 September 1907. She was completed in January 1911 and commissioned into the French fleet.&lt;ref name=G307/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peltier, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was the most powerful armored cruiser completed by France, but she entered service two years after the British [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}}, which rendered the armored cruiser obsolescent as a warship type.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, ''Edgar Quinet'' participated in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea to protest the [[Balkan Wars]]. Ships from other navies included in the demonstration were the British [[pre-dreadnought]] battleship {{HMS|King Edward VII}}, the Austro-Hungarian pre-dreadnought {{SMS|Zrínyi}}, the Italian pre-dreadnought {{ship|Italian battleship|Ammiraglio di Saint Bon||2}}, and the German [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Breslau}}. The most important action of the combined flotilla, which was under the command of British Admiral [[Cecil Burney]], was to blockade the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] coast. The goal of the blockade was to prevent [[Serbia]]n reinforcements from supporting the [[Siege of Scutari (1912–1913)|siege at Scutari]], where Montenegro had besieged a combined force of [[Albanians]] and [[Ottomans]]. Pressured by the international blockade, Serbia withdrew its army from [[Shkodër|Scutari]], which was subsequently occupied by a joint Allied ground force.&lt;ref&gt;Vego, pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
[[File:Edgar Quinet.png|thumb|''Edgar Quinet'' underway, c. 1911&amp;ndash;1914]]

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, ''Edgar Quinet'' was anchored off Durazzo with the British cruiser {{HMS|Defence|1907|6}} and destroyer {{HMS|Grampus|1910|6}} and the German ''Breslau''. The ships were moored there in a show of international support for a conference in Scutari over the status of [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett &amp; Newbolt, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; ''Edgar Quinet'' and the armored cruisers {{ship|French cruiser|Ernest Renan||2}} and {{ship|French cruiser|Jules Michelet||2}} were mobilized as the First Light Division and tasked with hunting down the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} and her consort ''Breslau''.&lt;ref name=GG193/&gt; These ships, along with a flotilla of twelve destroyers, were to steam to [[Skikda|Philippeville]] on 4 August, but the German cruisers had bombarded the port the previous day. This attack, coupled with reports that suggested the Germans would try to break out of the Mediterranean into the Atlantic, prompted the French high command to send ''Edgar Quinet'' and the First Light Division further west, to [[Algiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett &amp; Newbolt, pp. 61&amp;ndash;62&lt;/ref&gt;

After the German ships escaped to [[Constantinople]], rather than attack the French troop transports from North Africa as had been expected, ''Edgar Quinet'' joined the rest of the French fleet in its blockade of the [[Adriatic Sea]], based out of [[Pylos|Navarino]].&lt;ref name=GG193&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet, commanded by Admiral [[Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère]], had assembled by the night of 15 August; the following morning, it conducted a sweep into the Adriatic and encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser {{SMS|Zenta}}. In the ensuing [[Battle of Antivari]], ''Zenta'' was sunk, with no losses on the French side. The French fleet then withdrew due to the threat of Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett &amp; Newbolt, pp. 88&amp;ndash;89&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 1916, ''Edgar Quinet'', her sister {{ship|French cruiser|Waldeck-Rousseau||2}}, ''Ernest Renan'' and {{ship|French cruiser|Jules Ferry||2}} embarked a contingent of ''[[Chasseurs Alpins]]'' (mountain troops) to seize the Greek island of [[Corfu]]. The cruisers sent the troops ashore on the night of 10 January; the Greek officials on the island protested the move but offered no resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Lauzanne, pp. 121&amp;ndash;122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
''Edgar Quinet'' continued her service in the eastern Mediterranean after the end of the war in 1918. During the culmination of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Greco-Turkish War]] that immediately followed World War I, ''Edgar Quinet'' rescued 1,200 people from the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]] in 1922.&lt;ref name=GG193/&gt; In 1925, ''Edgar Quinet'' was converted into a training ship. The work lasted until 1927, and included the reduction of her armament to ten of her 194&amp;nbsp;mm guns, the removal of two of her funnels, and a reconstruction of her bridge.&lt;ref name=GG193/&gt; Then-Captain [[François Darlan]] commanded the ship in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, ''Edgar Quinet'' underwent an overhaul;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Moulin, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; during this modernization she was fitted with equipment to handle [[floatplane]]s for reconnaissance purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Marriott, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to service, the ship was assigned as a training ship for cadets from the ''[[École Navale]]'' (Naval Academy). On 4 January 1930, ''Edgar Quinet'' [[ship grounding|ran aground]] off the coast of [[Algeria]] west of [[Oran]] and proved to be a total loss.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Moulin, pp. 89, 167&lt;/ref&gt; She sank five days later.&lt;ref name=GG193/&gt;
