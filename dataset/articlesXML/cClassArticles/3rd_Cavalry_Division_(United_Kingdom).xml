The '''3rd Cavalry Division''' was a [[division (military)|division]] of the [[British Army]] in the [[First World War]]. It was formed at [[Ludgershall, Wiltshire]] England in September 1914 under the command of [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Major-General the Hon. Julian Byng]]. The division moved to [[Belgium]] in the first week of October 1914, landing at [[Ostend]], although its third Brigade was only formed once there.&lt;ref name=LLT_3_Cav&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.1914-1918.net/3cavdiv.htm | title=The 3rd Cavalry Division in 1914-1918 | publisher=The Long Long Trail | last=Baker | first=Chris | accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the war the division took part in most of the major actions where cavalry were used as a mounted mobile force, and also many where the troops were dismounted and effectively served as infantry.&lt;ref name=LLT_3_Cav/&gt;

On November 11, 1918, units of the division had reached the River Dender at [[Leuze-en-Hainaut|Leuze]] and [[Lessines]] in [[Belgium]], when orders were received that they would cover the advance of the [[British Second Army]] into Germany. They started the advance on 17 November, divisional headquarters being established at [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] on 21 November. The following winter was spent in Belgium but by 31 March 1919, the division was demobilized.&lt;ref name=LLT_3_Cav/&gt;

==History==
===Formation===
The 3rd Cavalry Division began forming on 1 September 1914 at [[Ludgershall, Wiltshire]].  Initially it commanded just two cavalry brigades – the 6th and the 7th – and divisional troops.&lt;ref name=Becke22/&gt;

The [[6th Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|6th Cavalry Brigade]] was formed with the [[1st Dragoons]]&lt;ref name=James11&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[10th Hussars]],&lt;ref name=James12&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; both from [[Potchefstroom]], South Africa, and the [[3rd Dragoon Guards]] from the [[Force in Egypt]] (though they did not join the brigade until 4 November in Belgium),&lt;ref name=James11/&gt; the only regular British Army cavalry regiments not stationed in the United Kingdom or India at the outbreak of the war.{{efn|In August 1914, the regular British Army cavalry comprised 31 regiments.  19 regiments were in the United Kingdom, nine in India, two in South Africa and one with the [[Force in Egypt]].&lt;ref name=James1113&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[7th Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Cavalry Brigade]] was formed with the three [[Household Cavalry]] regiments,&lt;ref name=Becke20&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only regular cavalry regiments remaining in the United Kingdom after mobilization of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] and its transport to France.{{efn|The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] mobilized with five cavalry brigades of three regiments each, plus two regiments employed as divisional cavalry squadrons, for a total of 17 regiments.  The [[Household Cavalry Composite Regiment]] was formed as the 17th regiment.&lt;ref name=James1113/&gt;}}  The [[1st Life Guards]] joined from [[Hyde Park Barracks, London|Hyde Park]], the [[2nd Life Guards]] from [[Regent's Park Barracks|Regent's Park]] and the [[Royal Horse Guards]] from [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].  Each regiment only consisted of two [[Squadron (army)|squadrons]] as each had provided a squadron to the [[Household Cavalry Composite Regiment]] in [[4th Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th Cavalry Brigade]] in August 1914.  The detached squadrons did not rejoin their parent regiments until 11 November 1914 in Belgium.&lt;ref name=James11/&gt;

XV Brigade, [[Royal Horse Artillery]] (and Brigade Ammunition Column) was formed for the division.  In peacetime, [[K Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|K Battery, RHA]] was at [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] and [[C Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|C Battery, RHA]] at [[Canterbury]].  Later, [[G Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|G Battery, RHA]] (originally at [[Ipswich]]) would join in Belgium.  Strangely, two RHA brigades formed early in the war were simultaneously designated as [[XV Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|XV Brigade, RHA]].  The other was formed at [[Royal Leamington Spa|Leamington]], [[Warwickshire]] in January 1915 for [[29th Division (United Kingdom)|29th Division]].&lt;ref name=Becke120&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 3rd Cavalry Division's brigade was renumbered as [[IV Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|IV Brigade, RHA]] in May 1915.&lt;ref name=Becke21&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd Field Squadron, [[Royal Engineers]] was formed on 16 September and the 3rd Signal Squadron, Royal Engineers on 12 September, both at Ludgershall.&lt;ref name=Becke22/&gt;  The division was also provided with two Cavalry Field Ambulances (6th and 7th), two Mobile Veterinary Sections (13th and 14th), and a divisional supply column (four [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]]).&lt;ref name=Becke20/&gt;

The division departed Ludgershall on 5 October, embarked at [[Southampton]] on 6 October and landed at [[Ostend]] on 8 October (7th Brigade at [[Zeebrugge]] on 7 October&lt;ref name=James11/&gt;) and deployed to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France and Belgium.&lt;ref name=Becke22/&gt;

===Early actions===
[[File:British cavalryman 1914.jpg|thumb|British cavalryman in Belgium, 13 October 1914]]
The 3rd Cavalry Division served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] until the end of the war.  In 1914, the division saw action in the [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|defence of Antwerp]] (9 and 10 October) and the [[First Battle of Ypres]], notably the battles of Langemarck (21–24 October), Gheluvelt (29–31 October) and Nonne Bosschen (11 November).

To bring the division up to the standard strength of three brigades, the [[8th Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Cavalry Brigade]] was formed in Belgium on 20 November 1914 with the 10th Hussars from 6th Cavalry Brigade and the Royal Horse Guards from 7th Cavalry Brigade.&lt;ref name=Becke20/&gt;  Each brigade was made up to three-regiment strength with [[yeomanry]] regiments: 6th Cavalry Brigade with the [[1/1st North Somerset Yeomanry]] from [[1st South Western Mounted Brigade]],&lt;ref name=James27&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7th Cavalry Brigade with the [[1/1st Leicestershire Yeomanry]] from [[North Midland Mounted Brigade]],&lt;ref name=James22&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 8th Cavalry Brigade with the [[1/1st Essex Yeomanry]] from [[Eastern Mounted Brigade]].&lt;ref name=James18&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the addition of its third brigade, 3rd Cavalry Division also obtained a third Cavalry Field Ambulance (8th, from England on 23 December) and a third Mobile Veterinary Section (20th, from England on 9 March 1915).&lt;ref name=Becke20/&gt;

===1915–17===
In 1915, the division took part in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] (Battle of Frezenberg Ridge, 11–13 May) and the [[Battle of Loos]] (26–28 September).

On 29 February 1916, [[Machine Gun Corps|Machine Gun Squadrons]] were added to the cavalry brigades, formed from the machine gun sections of each brigade's constituent regiments.&lt;ref name=LLT_Cav_MGC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.1914-1918.net/mgccav.html | title=Cavalry units of the Machine Gun Corps | publisher=The Long Long Trail | last=Baker | first=Chris | accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1916 saw no notable actions, but in 1917 the division saw action in the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] (First Battle of the Scarpe, 9–12 April).&lt;ref name=Becke22/&gt;  At other times, the brigades formed dismounted units and served in the trenches as regiments under the command of their brigadiers.&lt;ref name=Becke19&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstituted===
In March 1918, the [[1st Indian Cavalry Division|4th (formerly 1st Indian)]] and [[2nd Indian Cavalry Division|5th (formerly 2nd Indian)]] Cavalry Divisions were broken up in France.  The Indian elements were sent to Egypt where they formed part of the new [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th]] and [[5th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|5th Cavalry Divisions]] which played a major part in the successful conclusion of the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]].  The British and Canadian units remained in France&lt;ref name=Perry1620&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|pp=16,20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of them were transferred to the 3rd Cavalry Division causing it to be extensively reorganized.&lt;ref name=Becke20/&gt;

The Household Cavalry regiments were concentrated in the 7th Cavalry Brigade and the yeomanry regiments in the 8th Cavalry Brigade.  The latter left the division on 14 March 1918, the day after the [[Canadian Cavalry Brigade]] joined from 5th Cavalry Division.&lt;ref name=Becke18/&gt;  The three Household Cavalry regiments left 7th Cavalry Brigade on 10 March.  They were dismounted and converted to machine gunners as No. 1 (1st Life Guards), No. 2 (2nd Life Guards) and No. 3 (Royal Horse Guards) Battalions of the [[Guards Machine Gun Regiment]] at [[Étaples]].&lt;ref name=James11/&gt;  They were replaced in the brigade on the same day by the [[7th Dragoon Guards]] from [[9th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade]] of the 5th Cavalry Division,&lt;ref name=Perry20&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons]] from [[5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade]] of the 4th Cavalry Division&lt;ref name=Perry16&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[17th Lancers]] from [[2nd (Sialkot) Cavalry Brigade]] also of the 4th Cavalry Division.&lt;ref name=Perry16/&gt;  On 11 March, all three regiments came on the British War Establishment i.e. changed from a 4-squadron to a 3-squadron organisation.&lt;ref name=Becke20/&gt;

1918 saw the return of the war of movement and the division took part in the [[First Battle of the Somme (1918)|First Battle of the Somme]] notably the [[Operation Michael#The Battle of St. Quentin (21 – 23 March 1918)|Battle of St Quentin]] (21–23 March), Actions of the Somme Crossings (24 and 25 March) and [[Battle of the Avre]] (4 and 5 April); the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] and the battles of the [[Hindenburg Line]] ([[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle of Cambrai]], 8 and 9 October and the [[Pursuit to the Selle]], 9–12 October).  Its final action was in the [[Advance in Flanders]] (9–11 November).&lt;ref name=Becke23/&gt;

===Armistice===
At the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], units of the division had reached the River Dender at [[Leuze-en-Hainaut|Leuze]] and [[Lessines]] in [[Belgium]], when orders were received that they would cover the advance of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] into Germany. They started the advance on 17 November, divisional headquarters being established at [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] on 21 November. Transport difficulties meant that the only one cavalry division could advance with Second Army so the following winter was spent in Belgium.  By 31 March 1919, the division was demobilized.&lt;ref name=Becke23/&gt;
