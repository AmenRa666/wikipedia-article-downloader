'''HMS ''Totem''''' was a Group 3 [[British T class submarine|T-class submarine]] of the [[Royal Navy]] which entered service in the last few months of [[World War II]]. To-date, she is the only ship of the Royal Navy to have been named ''Totem''.

''Totem'' was sold to [[Israel]] in 1965 and commissioned into the [[Israeli Sea Corps]] in 1967 as [[INS Dakar|INS ''Dakar'']]. She sank whilst on passage from the United Kingdom to Israel in January 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3523.html HMS ''Totem''], Uboot.net&lt;/ref&gt;

==As HMS ''Totem''==
[[File:HMS Totem Sep 1945 SLV.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Totem'' in September 1945 – two of the three rear-facing external torpedo tubes are clearly visible]]
[[File:HMS Totem Sep 17 1945 SLV.jpg|left|thumb|''Totem'' in September 1945. Her totem pole is the cross-like object on the forward part of the bridge]]
The submarine was presented with a [[totem pole]] by the [[Cowichan Tribes]] in 1945, which was stolen during the 1950s when the boat was visiting [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Canada]]. The pole was fitted to the front of the bridge fin when the submarine was in harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rnsubmus.co.uk/collection/totem.htm| title = The Collection – Star objects | work = Royal Navy submarine museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war, all surviving T-class Group 1 and Group 2 boats were scrapped, but the Group 3 boats (which were of welded rather than riveted construction) were retained and fitted with [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel mast]]s.

In January 1948 it was formally acknowledged that the main operational function of the British submarine fleet would now be to intercept Soviet submarines slipping out of their bases in Northern Russia to attack British and Allied merchant vessels. The following April, the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff, Rear-Admiral [[Geoffrey Oliver]] circulated a paper in which he proposed that British submarines take a more offensive role by attacking Soviet submarines off the Northern Russian coast and mining the waters in the area. With the surface fleet dramatically reduced following the end of the Second World War, he commented that this was one of the few methods the Royal Navy had for &quot;getting to the enemy on his home ground&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;T-Class submarine&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The T-Class submarine – The Classic British Design | isbn = 0-85368-958-X | publisher = Arms and Armour | author = Paul Kemp | year = 1990 | page = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To fulfil this new role, ''Totem'' was one of eight boats which were extensively modified to become &quot;super T-conversions&quot;, giving them higher speed and quieter operation underwater. Five further T-class submarines were given much less extensive streamlining improvements.

The work on ''Totem'' was done between 1951 and May 1953 at [[Chatham Dockyard]] (which carried out all eight super T-conversions), and involved inserting an additional hull section {{convert|14|ft|m}} long to accommodate extra switchgear and an extra pair of electric motors and replacing the batteries. The hull was streamlined, which included the removal of the deck gun and the replacement of the bridge fin with one which was taller,  enclosing the periscopes and masts. The [[radar]] and [[sonar]] were updated at the same time. After the submarine had returned to service, her top speed exceeded {{convert|18|kn|km/h}}, aided by the unofficial removal in the dockyard at [[Malta]] of the housing for the airguard radar aerial which added 3/4 knot to her top speed.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Her captain at the time, Commander John Coote, reported that the modifications made evading her hunters during exercises easy, since the submarine could cover a mile in four minutes at {{convert|18|kn|km/h}}, and following another ten minutes running silently at {{convert|12|kn|km/h}} could be {{convert|3|mi|km}} away from the escort.&lt;ref name=&quot;T-Class submarine&quot;/&gt;

In 1953 she took part in the [[Fleet Review]] to celebrate the Coronation of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;Souvenir Programme, ''Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15 June 1953'', HMSO, Gale and Polden&lt;/ref&gt;

== INS ''Dakar''==
{{Main|INS Dakar}}
The submarine was purchased by [[Israel]] in 1965, along with two of her T-class sisters –  {{HMS|Truncheon|P353|2}} and {{HMS|Turpin|P354|2}}. She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the Israeli Sea Corps on 10 November 1967 as INS ''Dakar'' (דקר, ''Grouper'') under the command of Lieutenant Commander Ya'acov Ra'anan.

On 9 January 1968, ''Dakar'' departed from [[Portsmouth]] for [[Haifa]]. On the morning of the 15th, ''Dakar'' put into [[Gibraltar]], departing at midnight, and proceeded across the [[Mediterranean Sea]] underwater using her snorkel mast. Her last position report was at 0610 on 24 January, when she gave a location just east of [[Crete]]. There were three further routine messages which did not provide a position, the last being at 0002 on 25 January.

Despite an extensive search, no trace was ever found of the vessel. Her stern emergency marker buoy washed ashore on the coast of [[Khan Yunis]], an Arab town southwest of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], just over a year later, on 9 February 1969.

The wreck was finally discovered on 24 May 1999 at a depth of 3,000 meters (9,800&amp;nbsp;ft). The precise cause of the accident is not known, but as no emergency measures appear to have been carried out it is thought that the submarine dived suddenly and rapidly past her maximum depth limit and suffered a catastrophic hull rupture. The emergency buoy was released by the violence of the hull collapse, and washed ashore after drifting for a year.

On 11 October 2000, ''Dakar''’s bridge and forward edge of her sail were raised, and are now a memorial display in the Naval Museum in [[Haifa]].
