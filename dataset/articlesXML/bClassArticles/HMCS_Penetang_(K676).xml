'''HMCS ''Penetang''''' was a {{sclass2-|River|frigate}} that served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] from 1944–1945 during the [[Second World War]]. She fought in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] as a convoy escort. She was recommissioned and served as a {{sclass-|Prestonian|frigate|1}} from 1954–1956. She was named for [[Penetanguishene, Ontario]].

''Penetang'' was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1942 River-class building programme.&lt;ref name=uboat&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/213.html | work = Uboat.net | title = HMCS ''Penetang'' (K 676) |accessdate = 20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was laid down as ''Rouyn'' on 22 September 1943 by [[Davie Shipbuilding|Davie Shipbuilding &amp; Repairing Co. Ltd.]] at [[Lauzon, Quebec|Lauzon]] and launched 6 July 1944. Her name was changed and she was commissioned as ''Penetang'' into the RCN at [[Quebec City]] on 19 October 1944 with the pennant K676.&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenton |first=H.T. |last2=Colledge |first2=J.J. |title=British and Dominion Warships of World War II |publisher=Doubleday and Company Inc. |year=1968 |place=New York |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macpherson&gt;{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910–1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages= |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|River-class frigate}}

The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a &quot;twin-screw corvette&quot;, its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the [[Royal Navy]] at the time, including the [[Flower-class corvette]]. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the [[United Kingdom]], giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.friends-amis.org/index.php/en/document-repository/english/fact-sheets/44-canadian-river-class-frigate-1/file |title=Fact Sheet No. 21 – Canadian River Class Frigates |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;frigate&quot; was suggested by Vice-Admiral [[Percy Nelles]] of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2&gt;{{cite book|title=Frigates of the Royal Canadian Navy 1943–1974 |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |publisher=Vanwell Publishing |year=1989 |place=Lewiston, New York |pages=6–7, 15 |isbn=0920277225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at {{convert|7200|nmi|km}} at 12 knots.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat [[U-boats]] including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt; 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of the {{HMCS|Valleyfield|K329|6}}, they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; The design was too big for the shipyards on the [[Great Lakes]] so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the [[St. Lawrence River]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

==Service history==
After working up in [[Bermuda]] in November 1944, ''Penetang'' was assigned to Escort Group 9 of the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] (MOEF) as a convoy escort on trans-Atlantic supply convoys. She served the remainder of the war with the group, returning to Canada in June 1945. Upon the end of hostilities in Europe, ''Penetang'' was used as a troop-carrier between [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] and Quebec City. She was one of the few new River-class frigates not to be sent for a tropicalization refit. She was paid off into the reserve at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]] on 10 November 1945. In December 1945 she was sold to Marine Industries Ltd.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

''Penetang'' was chosen as one of the River-class frigates to undergo conversion to a ''Prestonian''-class frigate. She was reacquired from Marine Industries Ltd. and underwent conversion in 1953–1954 at [[Davie Shipbuilding|George T. Davie and Sons]] shipyard at [[Lauzon, Quebec]]. She was recommissioned there with pennant 316 on 1 June 1954. Following her reentry into service, ''Penetang'' was assigned to the [[First Canadian Escort Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Penetang Joins Escort Squadron |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=August 1950 |volume=6 |number=10 |pages=2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained in service until 2 September 1955, when she was paid off again at [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], with her crew reassigned to {{HMCS|Outremont|K322|2}}, which recommissioned the same day.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Outremont Joins, Penetang Departs |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=October 1955 |volume=7 |number=12 |pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Norwegian Navy===
It was announced in November 1955 that three ''Prestonian''-class frigates would be loaned to Norway; ''Penetang'', {{HMCS|Prestonian|K662|2}} and {{HMCS|Toronto|K538|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Three Frigates Lent to Norway |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |location=Ottawa |date=January 1956 |volume=8 |number=3 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Penetang'' was transferred to the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] on 10 March 1956 where she was renamed HNoMS ''Draug'', after the revenant [[Draugr]] from folklore. ''Draug'' was purchased outright in 1959 and served with the Norwegian navy employed on fishery protection duties.&lt;ref name=Jane&gt;{{cite book|title=Jane's Fighting Ships 1958–59 |editor=Raymond V.B. Blackman |publisher= McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc. |place=New York |year=1958 |isbn= |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served with the Norwegian navy until she was decommissioned and scrapped in 1966.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;
