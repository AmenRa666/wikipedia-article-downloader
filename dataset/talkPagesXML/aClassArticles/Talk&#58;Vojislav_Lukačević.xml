==Fate of his remains==
Does anyone know if there are references that explain what happened to his remains after his execution as such information is currently lacking in the article. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 23:37, 13 January 2013 (UTC)
:Not that I am aware of, in English at any rate. If the handling of DM's remains is any indication, it was probably done secretly or the location was not disclosed. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 00:39, 14 January 2013 (UTC)

== Non-massacring or non-collaborationist activities of Lukačević ==

I noticed that information about early life, non-massacring or non-collaborationist activities of Lukačević are neglected. There are several information or events that I believe deserve to be added to the article.

=== Travel to Montenegro in the Summer of 1941 ===

According to one source I found, Lukačević traveled to Montenegro in the Summer of 1941 two times because he was ordered by Mihailović to establish connection with officers from Montenegro.

[http://www.znaci.net/00001/4_14_1_32.htm Zainteresovan za događaje u Crnoj Gori, D. Mihalović je u leto 1941, u više navrata, pokušavao da uspostavi vezu sa tamošnjim oficirima. Sa tim zadatkom je rez. kapetan Vojislav Lukačević, po nalogu beogradske četničke organizacije, dva puta bezuspešno putovao u Crnu Goru.] --[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 08:35, 17 June 2014 (UTC)

::&quot;D. Mihajlovic was interested in events in Montenegro, and several times tried to establish a connection with the local officers in the summer of 1941. That task was given to Reserve Captain Vojislav Lukačević who, by order of the Belgrade Chetnik organization, twice unsuccessfully traveled to Montenegro&quot; - rough translation.--[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 14:52, 17 June 2014 (UTC)

::::::Pajović (already used in the article) also supports this and gives more details. He says (page 25) that Lukačević traveled to Montenegro three times because Mihailović sent him to establish contact with Yugoslav officers in Montenegro. First time &lt;u&gt;in June 1941&lt;/u&gt;. Pajović explains that all three attempts of Lukačević failed.--[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 07:18, 24 June 2014 (UTC)

::::::::There he explains (page 131 and 132) that Lukačević went to Montenegro in June to establish connection with Lašić, Stanišić and Miličko Janković. Lukačević carried written instructions for organization of Chetniks and their command structure in Montenegro and recommended relations toward other armed forces and political groups. Soon after Lukačevićs arrival to Montenegro the Uprising in Montenegro broke out so Lukačević was blocked in Podgorica for 10-15 days, where he stayed at his relatives. During those turbulent days he was unable to establish contact with former Yugoslav officers he was looking for, so he returned from Podgorica to Belgrade, via Skadar and Priština. In Autumn 1941 Mihailović (his subordinated officer Žarko Todorović) again dispatched Lukačević to Montenegro, and again he failed to perform his duty and returned via Priština and Raška to Belgrade. --[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 12:51, 26 June 2014 (UTC)

=== Battle for Novi Pazar ===

According to some sources Lukačević participated in the [[battle for Novi Pazar]] at the end of 1941. He defended Raška and tried to capture Novi Pazar from Albanian forces.--[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 14:13, 17 June 2014 (UTC)

=== Đurišić's successor after capture of Chetniks in Case Black operation ===
{{Not resolved}} (according to [[User:Antidiskriminator]], who edited the article to add this information, but also added information that had not been discussed here and for which no consensus had been achieved, and was therefore reverted. Since then, Antidiskriminator has not attempted to add just the material that was discussed)
When many Chetniks were captured in the initial phase of the Case Black, together with commander of Montenegrin Chetniks Pavle Đurišić, Lukačević was his successor as commander of the Lim-Sandzak Chetnik Detachment. He gathered remaining Chetniks in Sandžak and came to Berane on 14 July 1943. Here is the source:

:::::Although I read many sources about Chetniks and Djurisic in the last couple of years, the text of the article about Djurisic mislead me regarding the relations between Chetniks and Italians. I thought that they collaborated happily ever after (at least till Italy's capitulation) but this is far from what actually happened. Pajović (1977 work, page 361) gives more details about this. After Đurišić was captured by the Germans, the Italians disarmed majority of Chetniks in Montenegro, captured and interned to prison in Italy big number of Chetnik commanders, including many from the staff of LSCD. Initially, Lašić gathered scattered groups of Chetniks on the territory that was under Djurisić's control. Lasic and Djurisic were in conflict earlier (this needs clarification) and Djurisic's former associates did not trust Lasic, especially after one of former Djursic's deputies (Veskovic) died under mysterious conditions on the return from the meeting with Lasic. With approval of Rudolf Perhinek, envoy of the supreme command, they recreated Chetnik organisation and new staff of LSCD and asked from Mihailović to appoint Lukačević as their commander. (I can't believe that the text of the article does not even mention Perhinek).--[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 17:12, 27 June 2014 (UTC)

=== Lukačević fought the Germans at the Autumn of 1944, while both Lukačević and Đurišić wanted Chetniks to attack Germans ===
According to &quot;The Chetniks&quot; (Jozo Tomasevich - 1975, page 433 and 434) Lukačević ''&quot;had fought the Germans briefly in Herzegovina in September&quot;''. On the same page Tomasevich mentions 320 German officers and soldiers captured by Lukačević forces. The same source explains that Germans intercepted some Chetnik radio messages in October 1944 so they knew that both Lukačević and Đurišić wanted Chetniks to attack Germans. --[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 22:00, 17 June 2014 (UTC)

::: Schraml on attack on Trebinje: Über die Ereignisse beim I./Gren.-Rgt. 369 berichtet Unteroffizier Teimer: „Um den 20. (24.?) 9. wurden überraschend von den Cetniks, die bisher gemeinsam mit uns auf Spähtrupps und in die Einsätze gegangen waren, die äußeren Bunker um Trebinje in Besitz genommen, indem sie wie gewöhnlich in der Frühe vor den Bunkern erschienen und eingelassen wurden. Die Besatzungen dieser Bunker gerieten daher alle in Gefangenschaft. Kurz darauf traf beim Regiment — das wie auch einige Rgt.-Einheiten ebenfalls in Trebinje lag - die Aufkündigung der Waffenbrüderschaft ein, unterzeichnet nach der Mitteilung eines mir befreundeten Funkers von einem Major Lukačević. Gleichzeitig wurde das Rgt. aufgefordert, sämtliche Kroaten unserer Einheiten den Cetniks zu übergeben, dafür würde dem deutschen Personal freier Abzug gewährt werden. Der Rgt.-Kdr., Oberst Fischer, lehnte nach Rückfrage bei der Division, die Forderung ab und die Truppe richtete sich zur Verteidigung ein. Der Kampf begann laut Ankündigung der Cetniks genau 21 Uhr. Die Kroaten schlugen sich hervorragend, da sie fürchteten, bei Gefangennahme von den Cetniks getötet zu werden. Die Angriffe der Cetniks konnten abgewehrt werden. Trebinje wurde wenige Tage später (am 28. 9.?) von Truppen der 118. Jäg.-Div. von Dubrovnik her entsetzt. Gemeinsam mit ihnen wurden die Cetniks, die starke Verluste erlitten hatten, vertrieben und die Umgebung gesäubert. Sie wurden dabei so geschwächt, daß sie den Raum um Trebinje aufgeben mußten. Viele unserer Kameraden, die bei dem Abfall der Cetniks in Gefangenschaft geraten waren, kamen bei dieser Gelegenheit frei und fanden zur Truppe zurück.

=== Lukačević received by British King George VI in early 1944 ===

Serbian language edition of Tomaševićs 1975 says that Lukačević was received by high British officials, including the King George VI himself.

=== &quot;Waffenruhe-Verträge&quot; = Formal collaboration? Did Lukačević violate this agreement? ===
{{Not resolved}} (according to [[User:Antidiskriminator]], who has not edited the article to add this information)
Google Translate translates Waffenruhe-Verträge as &lt;u&gt;Ceasefire agreements&lt;/u&gt;. Croatian language edition of Tomašević work also refer to the Chetnik-German agreements as ceasefire agreements (''sporazum o primirju''). The text of article refers to this agreements as &quot;formal collaboration agreement&quot; and gives German language term &quot;Waffenruhe-Verträge&quot;:
* ''On 13 November, his representative concluded a formal collaboration agreement (German: Waffenruhe-Verträge)''

I propose to double-check if the sources are maybe misinterpreted in this case and whether ''Waffenruhe-Verträge'' really mean a formal collaboration agreement.

Croatian language edition of Tomasević 1975 work says that German General Meyszner was against agreement with Lukačević and launched a campaign against this agreements in February and was particularly against providing arms to Lukačević (and Đurišić) also because they violated the agreements. The text of this article does not mention that Lukačević violated agreement with Germans.  --[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 08:32, 23 June 2014 (UTC)
:On p. 321 JT uses the section heading &quot;Chetnik-German Collaboration Agreements in Serbia&quot;, then refers to them as &quot;so-called armistice agreements (''Waffen-ruhe Verträge'')&quot;. Later in that same section on p. 323, JT says &quot;Thus while in Serbia the Chetniks continued to pursue a policy of ambivalence, their relationship to the Germans was direct, rather than indirect through the Nedic regime, and fairly intensive, and at least for some months was based on ''formal agreements''.&quot; He then goes on immediately to describe the agreement between the Military Commander in Southeast Europe and Lukacevic concluded on 13 November.

:::::Hello Gorran. I noticed your recent involvement in articles on this topic and expected you to join here. Thanks for your careful explanation. Still, I think that your answer has not addressed two main points I brought here.:
:::::# &lt;u&gt;Translation/terminology issue&lt;/u&gt;: The text of the article implies that translation of ''Waffen-ruhe Verträge'' is ''&quot;formal collaboration agreement&quot;''. The source says that ''Waffen-ruhe Verträge'' actually means &quot;ceasefire agreements&quot;. If the source further explains that this ceasefire agreements were actually not only ceasefire agreements but in their essence the agreements of cooperation it can be explained in the text of the article, without wrong translation.
:::::# &lt;u&gt;Incomplete information issue&lt;/u&gt;: Tomasević 1975 work says that German General Meyszner was against agreement with Lukačević and launched a campaign against this agreements in February and was particularly against providing arms to Lukačević (and Đurišić) also because they &lt;u&gt;violated the agreements&lt;/u&gt;. If the text of the article presents information that Lukačević signed this agreement, it should present information that he violated it. --[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 13:28, 23 June 2014 (UTC)
::::::One thing at a time, Ad, I'll get to the HSSPF soon. Did I raise your cherry-picking? No, wish I had though, now that you mention it. Actually, you were the one who mentioned it. But now that you bring it to my attention, it IS a bit of a pattern. One more time. The source ''doesn't say that''. Verbatim, in English (of course), it says &quot;CHETNIK-GERMAN COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS IN SERBIA (that is the title of the section) The formal basis of all these so-called armistice agreements (''Waffen-ruhe Verträge'') between the representatives of the Military Commander in Southeast Europe and the leaders of the various Chetnik groups was the November 21 directive of Field Marshal Maximilian von Weichs, Commander in Chief in Southeast Europe, which listed the rules upon which these agreements had to rest:&quot; Now, I know from experience that you can struggle with this stuff, so I'll point out that when someone calls something &quot;so-called&quot; in English, they are questioning the validity of that description, I don't know what the idiom is in Serbian. So, he not only doesn't call them &quot;ceasefire agreements&quot; (he actually calls them &quot;so-called armistice agreements&quot;), but he is in fact questioning their description as &quot;armistice agreements&quot;. This is also clear from the fact that he chose to call the section of this chapter &quot;CHETNIK-GERMAN COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS IN SERBIA&quot;. Now, for me, this is a bit of a give-away. He is saying they are in fact &quot;collaboration agreements&quot;, not &quot;armistice agreements&quot;. If you were to read the sentence fragments you have honed in on in their proper context, you would get that. But that is exactly the point, isn't it. I don't know where you get &quot;ceasefire agreements&quot; from, but frankly, I have stopped wondering, really.

:::::::#&lt;u&gt;Translation/terminology issue&lt;/u&gt;: I pointed to the wrong translation which might mislead readers. &lt;u&gt;'''Formal collaboration ≠ &quot;Waffenruhe-Verträge&quot;'''&lt;/u&gt;. The source does not put &quot;Waffenruhe-Verträge&quot; after &quot;Formal collaboration&quot; but after &quot;ceasefire agreements&quot;. Like I said: If the source further explains that this ceasefire agreements were actually not only ceasefire agreements but in their essence the agreements of cooperation it can be explained in the text of the article, without wrong translation. The article uses [[Template:Lang-de]] which: ''&quot;is a template usually used to indicate to readers that the previous term or phrase is translated from a foreign language; .... It should generally be placed after the English translation of the German term or phrase.&quot;'' Is &quot;Formal collaboration&quot; translation of &quot;Waffenruhe-Verträge&quot;? No. I think I gave fairly clear explanation for my position regarding this wrong translation issue and don't have anything to add to it now.
:::::::# &lt;u&gt;Incomplete information issue&lt;/u&gt;: Your ''&quot;one thing at time&quot;'' position contradicts to your own position when you complained because I created separate section at talkpage of another article to discuss each of its numerous issues. In this case I don't think that those two issues related to Waffenruhe-Verträge necessarily have to be discussed in separate sections.

:::::::::Two main points addressed by Antidiskriminator:
:::::::::#&lt;u&gt;Translation/terminology issue&lt;/u&gt;: ''Waffenruhe Vertrage'' does mean &quot;ceasefire agreement&quot;, and does not mean &quot;collaboration agreement&quot;. But, this does not resolve the question did Lukačević make ceasefire, or collaboration agreement. What we have here is only a term, not a meaning. Here we have Tomasevich as a reliable source, and it is quite clear what he says: He notes that Germans '''named''' these arrangements &quot;armistice agreements&quot;, but '''they in fact were''' collaboration agreement. I think that Tomasevich is quite explicit on this: [http://znaci.net/temp/JT_Ch_321.jpg page 321]
:::::::::#&lt;u&gt;Incomplete information issue&lt;/u&gt;: did Lukačević violate the agreements? Well, I have my own opinion on this, but I don't think anyone should care. What is relevant is only: does reliable source say that he did? If yes, any diligent contributor is free to add a faithful interpretation to the article. But, I think that is not what Tomasevich says. In fact, on p.335 he quotes von Weichs, who states that, after cancellation of most of the agreements in February 1944, only agreement with Lukačević remains standing.--[[User:Gorran|Gorran]] ([[User talk:Gorran|talk]]) 20:27, 23 June 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::Thanks Gorran for your reply. Yes, Tomašević notes that Germans named these arrangements &quot;armistice agreements&quot;, but they in fact were collaboration agreement.

=== Break with Mihailović since February 1944? ===

The section about February 1944 — September 1944 is named &quot;Break with Mihailović&quot;. If the break happened in August and if in the meantime Lukačević was in good relations with Mihailović, even being appointed by him for commander of Chetniks in Stari Ras and illegal Chetniks in Sandžak and Montenegro, the title of this section could mislead readers about the timeline of relation between Lukačević and Mihailović. The source already used in this article (Pajović, page 82) confirms that Mihailović and Lukačević were in good relations after Lukačević returned from London and that Mihailović appointed Lukačević for commander of Chetniks in Stari Ras and illegal Chetniks in Sandžak and Montenegro.

The title of the subsection could mislead readers about the timeline of relations between Lukačević and Mihailović so I propose to expand the text about events in period between February and August and to split this section to two sections.

=== Appointment for the commander of Stari Ras Chetniks and illegal Chetnik forces in Sandžak and Montenegro ===

The source already used in this article (Pajović, page 82) explains that, when Lukačević returned from his trip to London, he went directly to Mihailović headquarter. The source also explains that Lukačević's travel to London was actually his mission undertaken against the order of Chetnik headquarter. It also explains that Lukačević brought to Mihailović important messages. He stayed for short time in the Chetnik headquarter and then was appointed to his old position of the commander of Chetnik forces in Stari Ras (part of Sandžak). Mihailović also appointed Lukačević as commander of illegal Chetnik forces in Sandžak and Montenegro. This made Đurišić angry. Đurišić was promised that he will remain commander of both illegal and legalized Chetnik forces. The source already used in this article (Pajović, page 82) says that after illegal Chetnik forces were given to Lukačević, Đurišić was angry because he had to play the &quot;black&quot; role of open collaborator of occupying forces. He wrote official complaint to Mihailović. After a month Mihailović again appointed Đurišić as commander of both legalized and illegal Chetnik forces in Sandžak, Boka and Montenegro. 

The text of this article does not mention the above appointments of Lukačević, so I propose to add this information to the article, unless there is some particular reason not to.--[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 10:50, 24 June 2014 (UTC)

Pajović (1977 work, page 363) explains that Lukacevic, based on instructions of Mihailovic, on 15 July 1943 invited some high rank Chetnik officers to stop with collaboration with Axis forces. He also proposed organisation of Chetnik forces in Montenegro. Mihailovic expected Allies to invade Balkans and in preparation for this, reorgaized Chetniks in Montenegro. He took away Stari Ras from responsibility of LSCD and appointed Lukacevic as its commander. Mihailovic appointed Lasic for commander of eastern Montenegro while commanders for western Montenegro were planned to be appointed by Lasic and Lukacevic, with approval of Djukanovic. Mihailovic emphasized that nobody is allowed to be legalised. Perhinek kept his position of Mihailovic's envoy for Montenegro responsible for intelligence service in Montenegro and Albania. Lukacevic was dissatisfied with Mihailovic's appointment of Lasic and offered his resignation. Several officers from Berane who were Djurisic's associates and disliked Lasic, joined Lukacevic. --[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 18:05, 27 June 2014 (UTC)
