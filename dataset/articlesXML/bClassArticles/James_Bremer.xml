'''Sir James John Gordon Bremer''', [[Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Royal Guelphic Order|KCH]] (26 September 1786 – 14 February 1850) was a British [[Royal Navy]] officer. He served in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[First Anglo-Burmese War]], and [[First Opium War|First Anglo-Chinese War]]. In China, he served twice as commander-in-chief of British forces.

Born in [[Portsea, Portsmouth]], Bremer joined the [[Royal Naval Academy|Royal Naval College]] as a student in 1797. While serving in the [[East Indies]], he became commander of [[HMS Rattlesnake (1791)|HMS ''Rattlesnake'']] in 1807. He was promoted to captain in 1814 and was nominated a [[Order of the Bath|CB]] the following year. After becoming commander of [[HMS Tamar (1814)|HMS ''Tamar'']], he was sent to [[Melville Island (Northern Territory)|Melville Island]], Australia, in 1824 to establish a colony. Under his leadership, the north coast of Australia from 129° to 135° longitude was claimed as British territory.

Bremer served twice as commander-in-chief of British forces in the First Anglo-Chinese War from 1839 to 1841. During the war, he took formal possession of [[Hong Kong Island]] for the United Kingdom in 1841. He was made a KCB the same year. In 1846, he was appointed second-in-command of the [[Channel Fleet]] and was superintendent of [[Woolwich Dockyard]] from which he retired in 1848. He died in 1850, having risen to the rank of rear-admiral.

== Early career ==
Bremer was born on 26 September 1786 in [[Portsea, Hampshire|Portsea]], Hampshire, England.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;&gt;Laughton, J. K.. &quot;Bremer, Sir James John Gordon  (1786–1850)&quot;. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004 ed.). Oxford University Press. {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/3313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only son of [[Royal Navy]] Lieutenant James Bremer (who went missing in the [[East Indiaman]] ''Halswell'' off the coast of [[Dorset]], England, on 6 January 1786) and his wife Ann, daughter of Captain James Norman. In 1794, he joined the Royal Navy as a first-class volunteer on board the [[flagship]] of [[HMS Sandwich (1759)|HMS ''Sandwich'']] at the [[Commander-in-Chief, The Nore|Nore]] of Rear-Admiral [[Skeffington Lutwidge]], from which he was discharged in June 1795. On 8 October 1797, he became a student of the [[Royal Naval Academy|Royal Naval College]] in [[Portsmouth]], and re-embarked on 2 April 1802 as a midshipman on board [[HMS Endymion (1797)|HMS ''Endymion'']] of Captain [[Philip Charles Durham|Philip Durham]]. Until July 1805, Bremer served in the flagship of [[HMS Isis (1774)|HMS ''Isis'']] under Vice-Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|James Gambier]] and Rear-Admiral [[Edward Thornbrough]], on the [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] and [[North Sea]] stations. Shortly after passing his examination, he was appointed sub-lieutenant of the [[gun-brig]] [[HMS Rapid (1804)|HMS ''Rapid'']]. On 3 August 1805, he became a lieutenant on board [[HMS Captain (1787)|HMS ''Captain'']] as part of [[William Cornwallis]]' force in pursuing a French fleet in [[Brest, France|Brest]], France.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbd&quot;&gt;{{cite wikisource | class = dictionary | first = William Richard | last  = O'Byrne | chapter = Bremer, James John Gordon | wslink = A Naval Biographical Dictionary | title = A Naval Biographical Dictionary | year  = 1849 | publisher = [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 1806, Bremer was appointed to [[HMS Diana (1794)|HMS ''Diana'']] of Captain [[Thomas James Maling]] in the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Station]], from where he proceeded to the [[Davis Strait]]. On 6 October, he served on board [[HMS Imogen (1805)|HMS ''Imogen'']] of Captain [[Thomas Garth (Royal Navy)|Thomas Garth]] in the Mediterranean. On 28 May 1807, he was appointed to the ''[[French frigate Psyché (1804)|Psyché]]'' of Captain William Wooldridge in the [[East Indies]], where he became commander of [[HMS Rattlesnake (1791)|HMS ''Rattlesnake'']] on 13 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbd&quot; /&gt; He became a captain on 7 June 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot;&gt;Stephen, Leslie (1886).

New York: Macmillan and Co. pp. 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 1815, he was nominated a Companion of the Most Honourable Military [[Order of the Bath]] (CB).&lt;ref name=&quot;nbd&quot; /&gt;

== Australia ==
On 18 September 1823, Bremer was appointed commander of [[HMS Tamar (1814)|HMS ''Tamar'']]. In February 1824, he was sent to [[Melville Island (Northern Territory)|Melville Island]], Australia, to establish a colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbd&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt; The site was intended as a military settlement to secure British trade in the region. It was hoped that a market would open to British merchants in the [[Malay Archipelago]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;&gt;Scott, Ernest (1988). ''Australia - Cambridge History of the British Empire''. Volume 7 (Part 1). Cambridge University Press. pp. 129–130. ISBN 0-521-35621-0.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1824, Bremer arrived in [[Sydney]] where he spent a month collecting troops and stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;bach&quot;&gt;Bach, J (1966). &quot;[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010137b.htm Bremer, Sir James John Gordon (1786 - 1850)]&quot;.

The north coast of Australia from 129° to 135° longitude was declared British territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh&quot; /&gt; Bremer rejected Port Essington as a settlement due to its lack of fresh drinking water.&lt;ref name=&quot;statham&quot; /&gt; On 26 September, the party landed at King Cove in Melville Island to build a settlement, which was named [[Fort Dundas]] on 21 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;bach&quot; /&gt; However, the site was unhealthy, expensive to maintain, and did not develop into an advantageous commercial trading post. In November 1828, orders were given to abandon the post.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot; /&gt;

In November 1824, Bremer sailed for India where he served in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bach&quot; /&gt; On 25 January 1836, he was made a Knight Commander of the [[Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order]] (KCH).&lt;ref name=&quot;nbd&quot; /&gt; In 1837, Port Essington was again selected as a possible trading station by [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Baron Glenelg]]. Bremer, who commanded the ''[[HMS Alligator (1821)|Alligator]]'' and ''[[HMS Britomart (1820)|Britomart]]'', was again given charge of the expedition. He established a new post in October 1838, calling it Port Victoria. The port was active until 1843 and by 1849, Port Essington was abandoned after it had no commercial or military value. Under the encouragement of New South Wales Governor [[George Gipps]], Bremer left Port Essington for China in June 1839, with the ships under his command, after news of trouble in the Chinese city of [[Guangzhou|Canton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bach&quot; /&gt;

Rear-Admiral [[Frederick Lewis Maitland (Royal Navy officer)|Frederick Maitland]], commander of the [[East Indies and China Station]], died in November 1839.
