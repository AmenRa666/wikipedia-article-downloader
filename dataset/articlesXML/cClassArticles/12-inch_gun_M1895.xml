The '''12-inch coastal defense gun M1895''' (305&amp;nbsp;mm) and its variants the '''M1888''' and '''M1900''' were large [[coastal artillery]] pieces installed to defend major [[United States|American]] [[seaport]]s between 1895 and 1945. For most of their history they were operated by the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps]]. Most were installed on [[Disappearing gun|disappearing carriages]], with early installations on low-angle [[barbette]] mountings. From 1919, 19 long-range two-gun batteries were built using the M1895 on an M1917 long-range barbette carriage. Almost all of the weapons not in the Philippines were scrapped during and after [[World War II]].

==History==
In 1885, [[William Crowninshield Endicott|William C. Endicott]], [[President]] [[Grover Cleveland]]'s [[secretary of war]], was tasked with creating the [[Board of Fortifications]] to review seacoast defenses. The findings of the board illustrated a grim picture of existing defenses, and in its 1886 report recommended a massive $127 million construction program of breech-loading cannons, [[12-inch coast defense mortar|mortars]], floating batteries, and [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|submarine mines]] for some 29 locations on the US coastline. Most of the board's recommendations were implemented. Coast artillery fortifications built between 1885 and 1905 are often referred to as &quot;Endicott Period&quot; fortifications. [[File:Guns at sandy hook.tif|thumb|left|12-inch gun (left) on early low-angle barbette carriage circa 1895 with 10-inch and 8-inch guns; these preceded the disappearing carriage in US service.]][[File:12-in-Disappearing-Carriage-1896.jpg|thumb|left|An M1895 coastal defense 12-inch gun on an M1896 disappearing carriage.]][[File:The new international encyclopaedia (1905) (14801701763).jpg|thumb|left|A coastal defense 12-inch gun on an M1895 disappearing carriage, showing raised and lowered positions.]] [[Watervliet Arsenal]] designed the gun and built the barrels. For several years, difficulties were encountered in building a disappearing carriage for the 12-inch gun. One alternative was the M1891 gun lift carriage, with the gun mounted on a large steam-powered elevator. Only one battery of this type was built, at [[Fort Hancock, New Jersey]]. When this proved to be too complex, guns were mounted on low-angle M1892 or M1897 barbette carriages. Eventually, the guns were mounted on M1896, M1897, or M1901 disappearing carriages designed by [[Bethlehem Steel]]; when the gun was fired, it dropped behind a concrete or earthen wall for protection from [[counter-battery fire]]. Bethlehem later built barrels as well.

After the [[Spanish–American War]], the government wanted to protect American seaports in the event of war, and also protect newly gained territory, such as the [[Philippines]] and [[Cuba]], from enemy attack. A new Board of Fortifications, under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s secretary of war, [[William Taft]], was convened in 1905. Taft recommended technical changes, such as more searchlights, electrification, and, in some cases, less guns in particular fortifications. The seacoast forts were funded under the Spooner Act of 1902 and construction began within a few years and lasted into the 1920s. The defenses of the Philippines on islands in [[Manila Bay]] were built under this program.&lt;ref&gt;Berhow, Mark A. and McGovern, Terrance C., ''American Defenses of Corregidor and Manila Bay 1898–1945'', Osprey Publishing Ltd.; 1st edition, 2003; pages 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railway mounting===
After the [[American entry into World War I]], the army recognized the need for large-caliber [[railway guns]] for use on the Western Front. Among the weapons available were 45 12-inch guns, to be removed from fixed defenses or taken from spares. At least 12 were mounted on railway carriages by mid-1919; it is unclear how many more were eventually mounted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hogg| first1 = Ian V. | last2 = | first2 = | title = Allied Artillery of World War I | pages = 141–142 | publisher = The Crowood Press, Ltd. | location = Ramsbury, Wiltshire, UK | year = 1998 | isbn = 1-86126-104-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed description of the railway mounting is given in ''Railway Artillery, Vol. I'' by Lt. Col. H. W. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugeneleeslover.com/ENGINEERING/Railway_artillery_guns_1921.html Miller, H. W., LTC, USA ''Railway Artillery, Vols. I and II'', 1921, Vol. I, pp. 197–250]&lt;/ref&gt; Like almost all US-made railway guns of World War I (the notable exception being the US Navy's [[14&quot;/50 caliber railway gun]]s), these never left the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cacunithistories/Railway%20Artillery.html US Army Railway Artillery in World War I]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all were returned to coastal defenses after the war; however, one survived for experimental purposes at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division]] until it was transferred to the [[U.S. Army Ordnance Training and Heritage Center]] at [[Fort Lee (Virginia)|Fort Lee, Virginia]] in the 2000s.

===Long-range mounting===

[[File:12-inch-in-casemate.jpg|thumb|right|300px|12-inch [[casemate]]d gun, typical of batteries casemated in World War II.]]
Also during World War I, it was recognized that naval guns were rapidly improving and longer-range weapons were needed. Fourteen two-gun and two one-gun batteries were constructed with M1895 guns on the new M1917 long-range barbette carriage, which allowed an elevation of 35 degrees, compared to 15 degrees for the disappearing carriages. This increased the range from {{convert|18400|yd|m}} to {{convert|30100|yd|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Berhow, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; These batteries were mostly in the [[CONUS|continental United States]], with the two one-gun batteries on [[Corregidor]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsg.org/fort-and-battery-list/ Coast Defense Study Group fort and battery list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berhow, pp. 224–226&lt;/ref&gt; The guns were originally in open mounts, but most were later [[casemate]]d against air attack, probably around 1940 as World War II approached the United States. The batteries in the Philippines, however, were not casemated, as the 1923 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] prohibited further fortification of US and Japanese Pacific-area possessions.

===World War II===
Along with other coast artillery weapons, the 12-inch guns in the Philippines saw action in the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|invasion in World War II]]. Since they were positioned against a naval attack, they had mostly armor-piercing ammunition and were poorly sited to engage the Japanese (although they did have 360° fire due to lack of casemates), and the open mountings were vulnerable to air and high-angle artillery attack.
[[File:corregidor gun.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Victorious Japanese troops atop Battery Hearn on 6 May 1942]]
Three additional long-range casemated batteries were constructed during the war, at [[Fort Miles]], [[Delaware]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], and on [[Sullivan's Island, South Carolina|Sullivan's Island]] near [[Fort Moultrie]] in the [[Harbor Defense Command|Harbor Defenses]] of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. With the additional construction of [[16&quot;/50 caliber Mark 2 gun|16-inch gun]] batteries at most harbor defenses, all guns on disappearing carriages were scrapped in 1943–44. The long-range batteries' guns were scrapped soon after the war ended.

The M1895MI weighed 52 tons and the M1901 carriage weighed 251 tons. The projectile weight for all M1895 guns was 1,046 pounds. Each shell used 318 pounds of powder, but this was varied depending on range. The projectile achieved a muzzle velocity of 2,250 feet per second. The M1901 disappearing carriage could elevate 15 degrees maximum; earlier models could not elevate that much until the rear mounting bracket was changed from a centerline to an upper position in the M1901. The M1901 could traverse 170 degrees, but some M1895MII emplacements could traverse 210 degrees. The M1895MII had a range of over 29,000 yards (26 kilometers).&lt;ref&gt;Berhow, Mark A. and McGovern,Terrance C.
