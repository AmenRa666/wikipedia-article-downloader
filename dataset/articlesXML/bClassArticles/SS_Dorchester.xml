'''''Dorchester''''' was a [[War Shipping Administration]] troop ship operated by its agent Agwilines allocated to [[United States Army]] requirements that was sunk in the [[Labrador Sea]] by a torpedo from a German [[U-boat]] on February 3, 1943, during World War II. It was sailing to [[Greenland]] as part of a naval convoy.

The loss of the ship became especially famous because of the story of the death of four Army chaplains, known as the &quot;[[Four Chaplains]]&quot; or the &quot;Immortal Chaplains,&quot; who all gave away their life jackets to save others before they died.

==Commercial service==
''Dorchester'', one of three identical ships, the first being {{SS|Chatham|1926|2}} ([[List of shipwrecks in August 1942|torpedoed and sunk August 27, 1943]]) and the last being {{SS|Fairfax|1926|2}}, was built for the Merchants and Miners Transportation Company by the [[Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]].&lt;ref name=PMR6-26&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pacific American Steamship Association; Shipowners Association of the Pacific Coast |year=1926 |title=Steamer ''Chatham'' Completes Successful Trials |journal=Pacific Marine Review |volume= |issue=June |pages=285–286 |location=San Francisco |publisher=J.S.

Passengers were provided three decks, two promenade decks and the boat deck, with four suites having private baths and thirty rooms with beds, ninety-eight with double berths and eight with single berths with most opening onto both the corridor and deck and all had &quot;European style&quot; telephones with receiver and transmitter in one handset.&lt;ref name=PMR2-27 /&gt; Public spaces included a dance pavilion and sun parlor in addition to the typical lounge and smoking rooms.&lt;ref name=PMR2-27 /&gt; Cargo of about 3,300 tons was all handled through side ports rather than deck hatches.&lt;ref name=PMR2-27 /&gt; Refrigerated spaces of {{convert|1,873|cuft|m3|1}} for provisions, including ice cream storage, was provided to six compartments cooled by a 4-ton Brunswick compressor.

==World War II==
The ship was delivered by Merchants and Miners Transportation Company to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) at Baltimore on January 24, 1942 for operation by  Atlantic, Gulf &amp; West Indies Steamship Lines (Agwilines) as agent for WSA and allocated to [[United States Army]] requirements.&lt;ref name=MARADVSC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marad.dot.gov/sh/ShipHistory/Detail/7638 |title=''Dorchester'' |author=Maritime Administration |date= |work=Ship History Database Vessel Status Card |publisher= U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration |accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grover |first=David |title=U.S. Army Ships and Watercraft of World War II |publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]] |year=1987 |pages=17, 20, 61 |isbn=0-87021-766-6 |lccn=87015514}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dorchester'' was converted to a troopship by Agwilines in New York, and fitted with additional lifeboats and life rafts, as well as four 20&amp;nbsp;mm guns, a [[3&quot;/50 caliber gun]] fore, and a [[4&quot;/50 caliber gun]] aft.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatships&quot;/&gt;

''Dorchester'' entered service in February 1942, crewed by many of her former officers, including her master initially, and a contingent of [[United States Navy Armed Guard|Navy Armed Guards]] to man the guns and to handle communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatships&quot;/&gt; The ship was neither owned nor bareboat chartered by the Army and thus not officially designated a United States Army Transport (USAT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=War Department |title=FM 55-105, Water Transportation: Ocean Going Vessels |publisher=War Department |date=September 25, 1944  |url=https://archive.org/stream/Fm55-105#page/n15/mode/2up |accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allocation to Army requirements, transport of Army personnel and presence of the Army administrative staff under the Transport Commander in command of embarked troops, led some to assume the ship was an Army transport.

===Loss===
[[Image:Escanaba-Dorchester rescue.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Coast Guard Cutter Escanaba (WPG-77) rescues ''Dorchester'' survivors, February 3, 1943.]]

On January 23, 1943, ''Dorchester'' left New York harbor, bound for the Army Command Base at [[Narsarsuaq]] in southern [[Greenland]]. SG-19 consisted of six ships: SS ''Dorchester'', two merchant ships (SS ''Lutz'' and SS ''Biscaya'') that were leased by the United States from the [[Norway|Norwegian]] government-in-exile, and their escorts, the small [[United States Coast Guard]] cutters {{Ship|USCGC|Comanche|WPG-76|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Escanaba|WPG-77|2}} (both 165 feet), and {{Ship|USCGC|Tampa|1921|2}} (240&amp;nbsp;feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armed-guard.com/dork.html |title=USAT Dorchester Files |accessdate=February 5, 2008 |publisher=World War II U.S. Navy Armed Guard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early morning hours of February 3, 1943, at 12:55, ''Dorchester'' was [[torpedo]]ed by {{GS|U-223}}. The damage was severe, boiler power was lost, and there was inadequate steam to sound the full 6-whistle signal to abandon ship, and ''Dorchester'' sank by the bow in about 20 minutes. Loss of power prevented the crew from sending a radio distress signal, and no rockets or flares were launched to alert the escorts. A severe list prevented launch of some port side lifeboats, and some lifeboats capsized through overcrowding. Survivors in the water were so stiff from cold they could not even grasp the cargo nets on rescue vessels. The crew of ''Escanaba'' employed a new &quot;retriever&quot; rescue technique whereby swimmers clad in wet suits swam to victims in the water and secured a line to them so they could be hauled onto the ship. By this method, ''Escanaba'' saved 133 men (one died later) and ''Comanche'' saved 97 men of the 904 aboard ''Dorchester''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166402/ |title=Top Ten Coast Guard Rescues |accessdate=February 5, 2008 |publisher=U.S. Coast Guard |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071113035712/http://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166402/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sinking of ''Dorchester'' was the worst single loss of American personnel of any American convoy during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/adminhist11_convoyrouting.htm |title=United States Naval Administration in World War II History of Convoy and Routing |author1=Headquarters of the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet |author2=Commander, Tenth Fleet |website=Naval History &amp; Heritage Command |publisher=United States Navy |accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life jackets offered little protection from [[hypothermia]], which killed most men in the water. Water temperature was {{convert|34|°F|°C}} and air temperature was {{convert|36|°F|°C}}. When additional rescue ships arrived on February 4 &quot;hundreds of dead bodies were seen floating on the water, kept up by their life jackets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, Volume I The Battle of the Atlantic 1939-1943 |first=Samuel Eliot|last=Morison| authorlink1=Samuel Eliot Morison |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Four Chaplains===
{{main|Four Chaplains}}
''Dorchester'' is best remembered today for four of the Army officers among the military personnel being transported overseas for duty: the Four [[Military chaplain|Chaplains]] who died because they gave up their life jackets to save others. These chaplains included [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister George L. Fox, [[Reformed Church in America]] minister Clark V. Poling, [[Catholic Church]] priest John P. Washington and [[Rabbi]] Alexander B. Goode.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaplains&quot;&gt;[http://www.fourchaplains.org FourChaplains.org], retrieved February 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress established February 3 as &quot;Four Chaplains Day&quot; to commemorate this act of heroism, and on July 14, 1960, created the [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism]], presented posthumously to the next of kin of each of the chaplains by [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Wilber M. Brucker]] at [[Fort Myer]], Virginia on January 18, 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaplains&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxfall.com/fmc-fcm.htm | title = Federal Military Medals and Decorations | publisher = Foxfall Medals }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

====Commemoration on US postage====
[[File:Immortal Chaplains-3c.jpg|thumb|240px|&lt;center&gt;The Immortal Chaplains&lt;/center&gt;Issue of 1948]]
In 1948 the [[U.S. Post Office]] issued a [[commemorative stamp]] in honor of the heroism and sacrifice of the chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Specialized Catalogue of US Postage Stamps.&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by Louis Schwimmer, the head of the Art Department of the New York branch of the Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stampcenter.com/blog/2010/06/25/682 StampCenter.com, &quot;A sweet tribute to Four Chaplains on a Postage Stamp,&quot; Pt III of III], retrieved February 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This stamp was highly unusual, because until 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/leadership/stamp-advisory-committee.htm |title=Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee |publisher=USPS |date=September 2011 |accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. stamps were not normally issued in honor of someone other than a [[President of the United States]] until at least ten years after his or her death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwimmer.com/fourchaplains/ Four Chaplains Stamp]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stamp went through three revisions before the final design was chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;stamp&quot;&gt;[http://stampcenter.com/blog/2010/06/23/a-sweet-tribute-to-four-chaplains-on-a-postage-stamp-part-ii-of-iii StampCenter.com, &quot;A sweet tribute to Four Chaplains on a postage stamp, part II of III&quot;], retrieved February 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the names of the chaplains were included on the stamp, nor were their faiths (although the faiths had been listed on one of the earlier designs): instead, the words on the stamp were &quot;These Immortal Chaplains...Interfaith in Action.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stamp&quot;/&gt; Another phrase included in an earlier design that was not part of the final stamp was &quot;died to save men of all faiths.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stamp&quot;/&gt; By the omission of their names, the stamp commemorated the event, rather than the individuals ''per se'', thus obfuscating the ten-year rule in the same way as later did stamps honoring [[Neil Armstrong]] in 1969&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.hiwaay.net/~krcool/Astro/moon/moonstamps/ms1969b.gif &quot;First Man on the Moon&quot; 10₵ United States Air Mail stamp]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Buzz Aldrin]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.hiwaay.net/~krcool/Astro/moon/moonstamps/ms1994b.gif &quot;First Moon Landing, 1969&quot; 29¢ United States postage stamp], based on a photograph of Aldrin captured by Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969 (July 21, UTC). Aldrin, conversely, captured no photographs of Armstrong.&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom were still alive.

===Notable passengers and crew===
The American writer [[Jack Kerouac]] served on ''Dorchester'', where he befriended an African-American cook named &quot;Old Glory,&quot; who died when the ship sank after the torpedo attack. Kerouac would have also been on the ship during the attack, but for a telegram he received from coach [[Lou Little]], asking him to return to [[Columbia University]] to play football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/08/15/DD8J193T9B.DTL&amp;tsp=1|title=Kerouac's unintended legacy?
