The '''Cave of the Patriarchs massacre''', also known as the '''Ibrahimi Mosque massacre''' or '''Hebron massacre''',&lt;ref&gt;Yoram Peri, ''The Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin'', Stanford University Press, 2000, pp.100–103 : ''The Hebron massacre in perspective''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a shooting [[massacre]] carried out by American-Israeli [[Baruch Goldstein]], also a member of the far-right Israeli [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach movement]]. On February 25, 1994, Goldstein opened fire on a large number of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Muslims who had gathered to pray inside the Ibrahimi Mosque at the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] compound in [[Hebron]], [[West Bank]]. It took place on February 25, 1994, during the overlapping religious holidays of both [[Jewish]] [[Purim]] and [[Muslim]] [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name=times940307&gt;George J.

Avi Issacharoff and Chaim Levinson, Haaretz, 28 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein was overpowered, disarmed and then beaten to death by survivors.

The massacre immediately set off mass Palestinian protests throughout the West Bank, and during the ensuing clashes a further 20 to 26 Palestinians were killed, and 120 injured in confrontations with the [[Israeli Defense Forces|IDF]],&lt;ref&gt;Ami Pedahzur, Arie Perliger [https://books.google.com/books?id=DF03xwLaPucC&amp;pg=PA70 ''Jewish Terrorism in Israel,''] Columbia University Press, 2011 p.70&lt;/ref&gt; while 9 Jews were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul G.

Goldstein was widely denounced in Israel and by communities in the [[Jewish diaspora]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot; &gt;[[Norman Solomon (rabbi)|Norman Solomon]], 'The Ethics of War in Judaism,' in Torkel Brekke (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ad5zYCnH9wC&amp;pg=PA44 ''The ethics of war in Asian civilizations: a comparative perspective'']  Routledge, 2006, pp39-78 p.44&lt;/ref&gt; with many attributing his act to insanity.&lt;ref&gt;1 Wilson, Rodney. 2007.

Six weeks later, [[Hamas]] carried out two suicide bombings against Israeli citizens, in what it called retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Yoram Peri,[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Vna5R9K3ogC&amp;pg=PA102 ''The Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin,''] Stanford University Press 2000 p.102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehud Sprinzak, [''Brother Against Brother: Violence and Extremism in Israeli Politics,''] Simon&amp;Schuster 1999 pp.242-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background of Baruch Goldstein ==
In the 1970s, Baruch Goldstein, who was born and lived in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], was a charter member of the [[Jewish Defense League]].&lt;ref&gt;Erroll Southers, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cyagBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43 ''Homegrown Violent Extremism''],  Routledge, 2014 p.43&lt;/ref&gt; After emigrating to [[Israel]] in 1983,&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last= Lacayo |first=Richard |author2=Lisa Beyer |author3=Massimo Calabresi |author4=Eric Silver |date=March 7, 1994 |title=The Making of a Murderous Fanatic | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980282,00.html | accessdate = October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; he served as a physician in the [[Israeli Defense Force]], first as a conscript, then in the reserve forces. Following the end of his active duty, Goldstein worked as a physician and lived in the [[Kiryat Arba]] settlement near [[Hebron]], where he served as an emergency doctor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/25/newsid_4167000/4167929.stm BBC NEWS] &quot;Goldstein had lived in Israel for 11 years and was a doctor in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, just outside Hebron.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein became involved with [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], and maintained a strong personal relationship with Kahane, whose views, regarded by the Israeli government as racist, had caused his party to be banned from the [[Knesset]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark. ''Terror in the Mind of God''. 2003, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Kahane was assassinated in 1990 by Arab terrorist [[El Sayyid Nosair]] in New York City, and Goldstein reportedly swore to take revenge for the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/hebron-massacre-brooklyn-doctor-with-a-prescription-for-hatred-1396680.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Hebron Massacre: Brooklyn doctor with a prescription for hatred | first=Peter | last=Pringle | date=1994-02-27 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein was elected to Kiryat Arba city council and in this capacity assisted in establishing a memorial park dedicated to Kahane.

In 1981, Goldstein wrote a letter, published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', which said that Israel &quot;must act decisively to remove the Arab minority from within its borders&quot;, which &quot;could be accomplished by initially offering encouragement and incentives to Arabs to leave of their own accord&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYT940226&gt;{{cite news |title=A History of Anti-Arab Feeling |author=Baruch Goldstein |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/26/world/l-a-history-of-anti-arab-feeling-326254.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 26, 1994 |accessdate=6 July 2012 |quote=Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg is correct when he asserts that in annexing Judea and Samaria (which he refers to as the West Bank), with its large Arab population, Israel would be endangering its Jewish character. According to statistics published by the Israeli Government in 1980, the Arabs of Israel have an average of eight children per household, as compared with an average of 2.9 children per Jewish home in Israel. However, Rabbi Hertzberg fails to note that even within the pre-1967 borders of Israel this same disparity of birth rates, associated with a declining Aliyah, assures Israel of an Arab majority in Israel (70 years?) unless steps are taken to prevent this from occurring. Ceding the &quot;West Bank&quot; to the &quot;Palestinians&quot; would, therefore, not solve the problem which Rabbi Hertzberg raises; it would serve only to further jeopardize Israel's security and betray a Biblical trust.&lt;br /&gt; The harsh reality is: if Israel is to avert facing the kinds of problems found in Northern Ireland today, it must act decisively to remove the Arab minority from within its borders. This could be accomplished by initially offering encouragement and incentives to Arabs to leave of their own accord, just as the Jewish population of many Arab countries has been persuaded to leave, one way or another. Before instinctively defending democracy as inviolate, Israelis should consider whether the prospect of an Arab majority electing 61 Arab Knesset members is acceptable to them. Israelis will soon have to choose between a Jewish state and a democratic one.&lt;br /&gt; Baruch Goldstein Brooklyn, June 30, 1981.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1993, inside the Ibrahimi mosque, acid was poured over the floor, leaving giant holes in the carpets, and six worshippers were assaulted. From the evidence of the sanctuary guards, Goldstein was identified as the culprit. A letter was written to [[Yitzhak Rabin]], the then Israeli Prime Minister, by the Muslim authorities &quot;regarding the dangers&quot; of Goldstein and asking for action to be taken to prevent daily violations of the mosque.&lt;ref name=Independent940301&gt;Helm, Sarah. [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/jewish-killer-attacked-mosque-last-year-evidence-is-mounting-that-baruch-goldstein-was-known-to-be-dangerous-well-before-the-massacre-writes-sarah-helm-1426229.html Jewish killer attacked mosque last year: Evidence is mounting that Baruch Goldstein was known to be dangerous well before the massacre]. ''[[The Independent]]''. March 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years before the massacre, an agent of [[Shin Bet]], the Israeli internal security service, who had infiltrated [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], passed a warning to his superiors about the danger posed by Goldstein. The agent ascribed to Goldstein the statement, &quot;There will be a day when one Jew will take revenge on the Arabs.&quot;&lt;ref name=Independent940301/&gt;

In Hebron, as elsewhere in the West Bank, tensions ran very high after the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993.&lt;ref name = &quot;book&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EVN_FhziN_EC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=palestinian+casualties+in+1993&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t2Yjak7_A8&amp;sig=RPN19yiTSIiqj9gVC81ywrs7X8g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w1p_SpnPC9_TjAeul-XwAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The struggle for sovereignty: Palestine and Israel, 1993—2005 ]&lt;/ref&gt; An unprecedented number of terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and Jewish settlers in the West Bank took place during 1993 and early 1994.

As the settlement's main emergency doctor, Goldstein was involved in treating victims of Arab-Israeli violence prior to that incident as well. He expressed anti-Arab feelings far before the massacre. Israeli press reports stated that Goldstein refused to treat Arabs, even those serving in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]; this was also reflected in comments by his acquaintances. He was known to refuse to treat [[Druze]] soldiers who served in the West Bank, claiming that it was against Jewish laws to treat non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://972mag.com/idf-jewish-soldiers-refuse-to-share-table-with-druze-comrades/40607/ | work=972mag | title=Jewish soldiers refuse to share Seder table with Druze comrades | first=Yossi | last=Gurvitz | date=2012-04-08 | accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theunjustmedia.com/Jewish%20Zionists/The%20Real%20Significance%20of%20Baruch%20Goldstein.htm |title=The Real Significant of Baruch Goldstein |author=Israel Shahak |newspaper=[[The Unjust Media]] |accessdate=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these anonymous claims were refuted by a number of sources, including Dr. Manfred Lehman and Dr. Chaim Simons, quoting the Shamgar Commission report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languages-study.com/harah/goldstein.html АКЦИЯ ДОКТОРА БАРУХА ГОЛЬДШТЕЙНА В ПЕЩЕРЕ МАХПЕЛА] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Massacre ==
25 February 1994 coincided with the Jewish festival of Purim, and fell during the Muslim Ramadan. On the eve of the massacre, Goldstein listened to a reading in the Hall of Abraham of the [[megillah|Scroll of Esther]], and spoke to others of the need to behave like [[Esther]]. Some{{who|date=October 2016}} consider it not coincidental that he then carried out the execution as Purim was celebrated. In this context the festival of Purim was associated with a reading that concerns [[Amalek]], with whom, in Israeli extremist rhetoric Palestinians are often identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot; /&gt;Joseph Tuman has conjectured he saw himself as [[Mordecai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Communicating Terror: The Rhetorical Dimensions of Terrorism |first=Joseph S. |last=Tuman |page=93 |isbn=1-4129-7324-4 |publisher=Sage Publications, Inc. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=siiaBHIPs1QC&amp;pg=PA93 |year=2003 |accessdate=2010-03-13 |quote=Although Goldstein did not say anything during his attack to explain his actions, it is known that the night before his assault he had attended a service at the Jewish side of the Cave of the Patriarchs where after listening to the traditional reading from the Scroll of Esther, he told others there that they should all behave like Esther. The timing of his attack the next day at the same site hardly seems the product of happenstance or coincidence. It was the day of Purim. Moreover, although his actions seemed to be the product of a mind that had snapped or become depraved, there did not seem to be any sign that he was suffering from a mental disorder. His actions were deliberate and intentional. Goldstein was troubled by the ongoing peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in Oslo and openly concerned that a Palestinian state was about to be created. His attack on Muslim worshippers at the same site, while Purim coincided with Ramadan, was an attempt to cast himself symbolically in the story as Mordecai. Indeed that was exactly the way his actions were interpreted by other settlers at Kiryat Arba, and in the years to come after 1994, there would be numerous instances in which the settlers would celebrate Purim by also invoking Goldstein's memory and image in a provocative manner. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Lustick]] thinks it likely Goldstein thought of [[Yasser Arafat]] as a modern day [[Haman]].&lt;ref&gt; [[Ian Lustick]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=dD-1Nm6NTHQC&amp;pg=PR10  ''For the Land and the Lord: Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel,''] [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (1988) 1994 pp.x-xi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Block,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=t9OqbkFfmOgC&amp;pg=PA52 ''A Fatal Addiction: War in the Name of God,'']  Algora Publishing 2012 p52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Jews and Muslims were permitted to access their respective parts of the compound. At 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 25 February, 800 [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Muslim]]s passed through the east gate of the cave to participate in [[Fajr]], the first of the [[salat|five daily Islamic prayers]].&lt;ref&gt;Report of Shamgar Commission p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The cave was under [[GOC Army Headquarters|Israeli Army]] guard, but of the nine soldiers supposed to have been on duty, four were late turning up, and only one officer was there.

Shortly afterwards, passing through the Hall of Abraham, Goldstein entered the Hall of Isaac, where some 800 Muslims were at prayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP&quot; /&gt; He was dressed in his army uniform and carried an [[IMI Galil]] assault rifle and four magazines of ammunition, which held a total of 140 rounds in 35 rounds per magazine. He was not stopped by the guards, who assumed that he was an officer entering the tomb to pray in an adjacent chamber reserved for Jews. Standing in front of the only exit from the hall and positioned to the rear of the Muslim worshippers, is reported as having thrown a grenade into the middle of the hall,&lt;ref name=&quot;PP&quot; &gt;Ami Pedahzur, Arie Perliger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DF03xwLaPucC&amp;pg=PA69 ''Jewish Terrorism in Israel''], Columbia University Press, 2011 pp.69ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_That_Day&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/16/world/that-day-hebron-special-report-soldier-fired-crowd-survivors-massacre-say.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=That Day in Hebron – A special report.; Soldier Fired at Crowd, Survivors of Massacre Say | first=Chris | last=Hedges | date=1994-03-16 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then opened fire, killing 29 people and wounding another 125, among them children. Several people were left with paralyzing wounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiles&quot;/&gt; According to survivors, Goldstein bided his time until ''sujūd'', the part of the prayer where worshippers prostrate themselves with their heads on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Yoram Peri, ''The assassination of Yitzhak Rabin'', Stanford University Press, 2000 p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; After someone in the crowd hurled a fire extinguisher, which struck him on the head, he was overcome, disarmed and then beaten to death.&lt;ref name=times940307 /&gt; No criminal charges were filed in connection with his killing.

Reports after the massacre were often contradictory. There was initial uncertainty about whether Goldstein had acted alone; it was reported that eyewitnesses had seen &quot;another man, also dressed as a soldier, handing him ammunition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hebron Massacre: Hell comes to a holy place&quot;, ''The Independent'' (London), 27 February 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many testimonies that made mention of Israeli guards outside the cave having opened fire. Israeli military officials claim that no Israeli troops fired on the Palestinian worshipers.  However, ''The New York Times'' interviewed over 40 different Palestinian eyewitnesses, many of whom were confined to hospital beds with gunshot wounds, and thus &quot;unable to compare notes&quot;.  All witnesses corroborated that three Israeli guards opened fire, likely in panic amid the confusion, as the Muslims fled the shrine, with at least one soldier firing into the crowd.&lt;ref name=NYT_That_Day/&gt; During the inquiry, an Israeli army official said three worshipers died in the stampede following the attack and five Palestinians were killed in street riots within Hebron later that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes8Mar1994&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/09/world/israeli-army-says-security-was-lax-at-massacre-site.html Israeli Army Says Security Was Lax at Massacre Site], NY Times, March 8, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The testimony of various Israeli military officials was often contradictory. For instance, [[Danny Yatom]] asserted that two of the guards had fired six or seven shots in the confusion &quot;but only in the air,&quot; while the two guards themselves, Sgt. Kobi Yosef and Sgt. Niv Drori, later testified to firing four shots &quot;chest high&quot;.&lt;ref name=inve&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/world/confusing-israeli-testimony-poses-possibility-of-hebron-accomplice.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Confusing Israeli Testimony Poses Possibility of Hebron Accomplice | first=Clyde | last=Haberman | date=1994-03-18 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guards' testimony was also at odds with the testimony of their ranking officer in claiming they had seen another Jewish settler enter the cave bearing arms.&lt;ref name=inve /&gt; Tikva Honig-Parnass wrote that 10 Palestinians were killed and more than 100 injured by Israeli soldiers who continued to shoot at those who were trying to flee the mosque, at those who were evacuating the wounded, and at people who were rioting at the Ahli hospital.

== Violence in the aftermath ==
As word of the incident spread throughout the occupied territories, confrontations broke out in which a further 20 Palestinians were killed and 120 injured.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP&quot; /&gt; In the first 6 days following the massacre, 21 Palestinians were killed by live ammunition from the IDF.&lt;ref name=Abraham&gt;Nabeel Abraham,  [http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/articles/article0002775.html What About The Victims?], Lies of Our Times, May 1994, pp 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1994 on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in [[New York City]], Lebanese-born immigrant Rashid Baz shot at a van of 15 [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] students, [[1994 Brooklyn Bridge shooting|killing one and injuring three others]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pix11.com/2014/02/27/back-at-police-plaza-bratton-and-miller-recall-20th-anniversary-of-brooklyn-bridge-shooting/#ixzz2udWx6am5 |title=Back at Police Plaza, Bratton and Miller recall 20th anniversary of Brooklyn Bridge shooting |first=Mary |last=Murphy |date=March 1, 2011 |publisher=[[WPIX]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the shooting spree, the gunman reportedly shouted in Arabic &quot;Kill the Jews,&quot; expressing revenge for the massacre of 29 Muslim worshipers at the Cave of the Patriarchs.

Two separate [[suicide bombings]] took place in April 1994, carried out by [[Palestinian militants]] inside Israel and launched by [[Hamas]]' [[Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades]], allegedly in retaliation for the massacre carried out by Goldstein.{{ref label|bombing|i}}&lt;ref name=Martinp358&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ6MeYq_FbkC&amp;pg=PA358&amp;dq=suicide+bombing+baruch+goldstein+1994&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=suicide%20bombing%20baruch%20goldstein%201994&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues|author=[[C.

Those were the first suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian terrorists inside Israel.

Several people were left with paralyzing wounds. Palestinians count the number of murdered to include those who later expired or were shot outside the mosque in the immediate aftermath.&lt;ref name=Wiles&gt;Rich Wiles, [http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2014/02/remembering-ibrahimi-mosque-ma-2014223105915230233.html Remembering the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre], [[Al Jazeera]] 24 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==

=== Israeli government ===
The [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] movement, with which Goldstein was affiliated, was outlawed as a terrorist organization. The cabinet decided to confiscate the weapons of some they regarded as [[Far-right|right-wing extremists]] and put them in administrative detention. The Israeli government also took extreme measures against Palestinians following the massacre, banning them from certain streets in Hebron, such as [[Al-Shuhada Street]], where many Palestinians have homes and businesses, and opening them to the exclusive access of Jewish Israelis and foreign tourists.&lt;ref name=shame&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/the-shame-of-shuhada-street-hebron/372639/|title=The Shame of Shuhada Street|author=AYELET WALDMAN|publisher=The Atlantic|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address to the [[Knesset]], Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin denounced Goldstein. Rabin, addressing not just Goldstein and his legacy, but also other settlers he regarded as militant, declared,

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are not part of the community of Israel... You are not part of the national democratic camp which we all belong to in this house, and many of the people despise you. You are not partners in the Zionist enterprise. You are a foreign implant. You are an errant weed. Sensible Judaism spits you out. You placed yourself outside the wall of Jewish law... We say to this horrible man and those like him: you are a shame on [[Zionism]] and an embarrassment to Judaism.&lt;ref name=nytimes940301 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabin considered that his failure to close down the Jewish settlements in Hebron after the massacre one of his greatest political mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;Amos N. Guiora, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dmPiBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39 ''Freedom from Religion: Rights and National Security''], Oxford University Press, 2013 p.39 and n.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Netanyahu]], then head of the opposition [[Likud]] party, declared, &quot;This was a despicable crime. I express my unequivocal condemnation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quotes from ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' (London) 4 March 1994, pp. 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shamgar Commission ====
The Israeli government appointed a commission of inquiry headed by then president of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]], [[Meir Shamgar|Judge Meir Shamgar]]. The commission in the epilogue to its report called the massacre &quot;a base and murderous act, in which innocent people bending in prayer to their maker were killed&quot;. Among its specific conclusions were:
* Goldstein acted alone in planning the massacre, telling no one of his scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfathe&quot;&gt;Commission of Inquiry Into the Massacre at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron – [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal%20Issues%20and%20Rulings/COMMISSION%20OF%20INQUIRY-%20MASSACRE%20AT%20THE%20TOMB%20OF%20THE Excerpts from the Report]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Coordination between the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], the police, and the Civil Administration was problematic.
* The political leadership and [[Shin Bet|security forces]] could not have been expected to predict the massacre.
* Testimony from survivors referring to IDF assistance and grenade explosions in the massacre was found to be contradictory and inconsistent; investigators did not find any grenade fragments.{{ref|mfa}}
* There were, as claimed by some Jews seeking to justify Goldstein's actions as a preemptive strike, substantial warnings of a coming [[Hamas]] terror attack against Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfathe&quot;/&gt; It further stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
::8.2a &quot;... warnings were issued regarding an expected attack by Hamas following the distribution of its leaflets in Hebron.&quot;
::8.7a &quot;Following an incident in Abu-Dis, which ended in the deaths of a number of members of Az-A-Din Al-Qassam [of Hamas], emotions ran high among the Moslem worshipers (about two hundred), who shouted hostile slogans (&quot;Qassam&quot;, &quot;kill the Jews&quot;), [at the Jewish worshipers], making it necessary to call in army and Border Police forces. According to one of the Moslem witnesses, the Jews also shouted hostile slogans.&quot; (This is in reference to persons present on the previous evening.)
::8.8a &quot;Those in charge of security at the Tomb were given no intelligence reports that an attack by a Jew against Moslem worshipers could be expected, particularly since intelligence reports warned of the opposite: an attack by Hamas. Therefore, there was concern about an attack by Arabs against Jews.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal%20Issues%20and%20Rulings/COMMISSION%20OF%20INQUIRY-%20MASSACRE%20AT%20THE%20TOMB%20OF%20THE|title=COMMISSION OF INQUIRY- MASSACRE AT THE TOMB OF THE PATRIARCHS IN HEBRON-26-Jun-94|work=GxMSDev}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics of the commission have suggested that Shamgar's judicial record has &quot;consistently displayed his leniency toward the settlers, including those convicted of crimes against the Palestinians, but especially toward the soldiers who had fired at the Palestinians&quot; and that his career reflected a history of pro-settler activism by promoting expropriation of Palestinian land to Jewish settlement that are against international law.&lt;ref name=&quot;mepc.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mepc.org/journal_shahak/shahak48.asp |accessdate=February 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106162256/http://www.mepc.org////journal_shahak/shahak48.asp |archivedate=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli public ===
There was widespread condemnation of the massacre in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oliver|Steinberg|2005|p=xix}}: &quot;These acts were widely regarded with revulsion by Israeli citizens and condemned as acts of lunacy and terror by Israeli politicians, right and left.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A poll found that 78.8% of Israeli adults condemned the Hebron massacre, while 3.6% praised Goldstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |location=London |date=4 March 1994 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yesha Council|Jewish Settler Council]] declared that the act was &quot;not Jewish, not humane&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobson 1997 91&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobson|1997|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most religious leaders denounced the attack. The [[Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron|Sephardi Chief Rabbi]] said &quot;I am simply ashamed that a Jew carried out such a villainous and irresponsible act&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rayner 1998 90&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rayner|1998|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that he be buried outside the cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobson 1997 91&quot;/&gt; His Ashkenazi counterpart, [[Yisrael Meir Lau]], called it &quot;a desecration of God's name&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rayner 1998 90&quot;/&gt; Rabbi [[Yehuda Amital]] of [[Gush Etzion]] said Goldstein had &quot;besmirched the Jewish nation and the Torah&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hacohen|2008|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rabbis reacted with ambivalence to the massacre,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Inbari|2012|pp=134–6}}: &quot;The response of Rabbi [[Shlomo Aviner]] to the massacre was characterized by ambivalence.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and a few praised Goldstein and called his undertaking &quot;an act of martyrdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linnan|2008|p=198}}: &quot;Despite general and overwhelming condemnation from Jews around the world about this unprovoked attack on unarmed civilians, a few rabbis and lay leaders in Israel and North America praised Goldstein's murderous action and death as an act of martyrdom (''Kiddush Hashem'').&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In eulogizing Goldstein, Rabbi [[Israel Ariel]] called him a &quot;holy martyr&quot;, and questioned the innocence of the victims by claiming they were responsible for the massacre of Hebron's Jews in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2002|p=205}}: &quot;Did he kill innocent people? The same supposedly innocent people slaughter innocents in 1929... The whole city of Hebron slaughtered Jews then. Those are the 'innocent people' who were killed in the Tomb of the Patriarchs&quot;, said Ariel.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Dov Lior]] of [[Kiryat Arba]] said he was a saint whose &quot;hands are innocent, his heart pure&quot;, and compared him to the martyrs of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lichtenstein|Lior|1994|p=59}}: &quot;Yes, I did eulogise the late Baruch Goldstein (may God avenge his blood), who was lynched by the non-Jews in the Cave. A Jew who is killed because he is a Jew must certainly be called a ''kadosh'', a holy martyr, just as we refer to the ''kedoshei ha-Shoah'', the holy martyrs of the Holocaust, without investigating their previous conduct. How much more so in this case, for we knew him intimately as God-fearing and compassionate, as one who loved humanity and saved lives. [...] In my eulogy, I intentionally did not mention the deed, but focused on his personality and his achievements, and I did not take a public position on the deed.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, settler rabbi [[Yitzhak Ginzburgh]] was the only prominent Orthodox rabbi who praised the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2012|p=283}}: &quot;In 1994, Ginzburg was the only Orthodox rabbi of stature who praised Baruch Goldstein's massacre...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He has since been detained several times for espousing extremist views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/8955/ Israeli Rabbi Indicted for Inciting Racism], [[Forward (magazine)|Forward]],  (June 06, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Veneration of Goldstein ====
In the weeks following the massacre, hundreds of Israelis traveled to Goldstein's grave to celebrate Goldstein's actions. Some Hasidim danced and sang around his grave.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/01/world/hundreds-of-jews-gather-to-honor-hebron-killer.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Hundreds of Jews Gather To Honor Hebron Killer | first=Clyde | last=Haberman | date=1994-04-01 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government has said that those who celebrated the massacre represented only a tiny minority of Israelis, a ''New York Times'' report states that Israeli government claims may understate the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

In a pamphlet titled ''Baruch HaGever''&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;ברוך הגבר; meaning both Baruch the Man and &quot;blessed be the man&quot;. From Jeremia 17:7&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1994, and a book of the same name in 1995, various rabbis praised Goldstein's action as a pre-emptive strike in response to Hamas threats of a pogrom, and wrote that it is possible to view his act as following five [[Halakha|Halachic]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Motti Inbari, ''Jewish Fundamentalism and the Temple Mount: Who Will Build the Third Temple?'' (State University of New York Press, 2009), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seeman&gt;Don Seeman, Violence, ethics, and divine honor in modern Jewish thought, ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 73 (2005), 1015–1048.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of the adoration of Goldstein's tomb persisted for years, despite Israeli government efforts to crack down on those making pilgrimage to Goldstein's grave site.&lt;ref name = &quot;Party&quot;&gt;{{cite news

=== Jewish diaspora ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Chief Rabbi]] Dr. [[Jonathan Sacks]] stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such an act is an obscenity and a travesty of [[Jewish values]]. That it should have been perpetrated against worshippers in a house of prayer at a holy time makes it a [[blasphemy]] as well... Violence is evil. Violence committed in the name of God is doubly evil. Violence against those engaged in worshipping God is unspeakably evil.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' (London) 4 March 1994, p. 1 and then expanded on p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An editorial in ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' written by [[Chaim Bermant]] denounced the Kach organisation to which Goldstein belonged as [[Neo-Nazi|&quot;Neo-Nazis&quot;]] and a U.S. creation, funded by American money and a product of American gun culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;bermant&quot;&gt;Chaim Bermant &quot;Has one settler settled the settlers future?&quot; in ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' (London), 4 March 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The same edition also reported that some [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|Liberal]] [[synagogue]]s in the UK had begun fundraising for Goldstein's victims.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Chronicle'' (London), 4 March 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palestinian public ===
[[File:Palestinians demonstrate in the 20th anniversary of the Massacre of Hebron.jpg|420px|thumbnail|right|Israeli Army and Border Police troops stop Palestinians from entering Al-Shuhada' St. during the demonstration in the 20th anniversary of the massacre]]
Palestinian protesters took to the streets in the aftermath of the massacre. There were widespread protests and clashes in both the occupied territories and within Israel itself, in Nazareth and Jaffa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/world/west-bank-massacre-palestinians-battle-israelis-to-protest-hebron-massacre.html Palestinians Battle Israelis To Protest Hebron Massacre], NY Times, Feb 27, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction to the trauma induced in children in Hebron, the [[Palestinian Child Arts Center]] (PCAC), a non-governmental, nonprofit organization was founded. The activities of the centre primarily involve the intellectual development of Palestinian children, and to reinforce a positive role for the child within Palestinian society and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Epstein (2008) ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Children's Issues'', Worldwide Greenwood Press, ISBN 0-313-33878-7 p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations ===
The [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 904|Resolution 904]] condemning the massacre and called for measures to protect Palestinian civilians including disarming Israeli settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/19/world/mideast-diplomacy-un-security-council-condemns-the-hebron-slayings.html U.N.
