==Regalskeppet Kronan==
Shouldnt the title be Regalskeppet Kronan? --[[User:Dahlis|Dahlis]] 17:25, 2005 August 30 (UTC)

-Why? Regalskepp is just what it was. The page on HMS Victory isn't labelled &quot;Ship-of-the-line Victory&quot; for example.

But the HMS Victory page is named exactly that, &quot;HMS Victory&quot;. The name &quot;Regalskeppet Kronan&quot; would follow the same convention. (And yes, I know that this contradicts wiki guidelines, but these are very US-centric.)

:Yes, but HMS is a prefix; &quot;regalskeppet&quot; is not. Equivalent to &quot;Regalskappet Kronan&quot; would be &quot;Ship-of-the-line HMS Victory&quot;.

::This seems to be a rather widespread misunderstanding, especially among Swedish contributors, but ''regalskepp'' (lit. &quot;regal ship&quot;) is ''not'' a specific type of ship, but rather a very specific kind of classification. The closest equivalent would be the [[first-rate]] ship within the [[rating system of the Royal Navy]]. Of what I've understood of ship construction, most ''regalskepp'' built in the 17th century would probably be best described as being a transitional design between a [[galleon]] and a [[ship of the line]].

==Coordinates==
I have added coordinates to the page, based on the Kronan museum website which describes its location as &quot;4 nautical miles due east of the church at Hulterstad&quot;. I translated that into 7.4 km and then added approximate coordinates. - [[User:Gump Stump|Gump Stump]] ([[User talk:Gump Stump|talk]]) 07:52, 1 June 2010 (UTC)
:I changed the coordinates to the equivalent of 3.4 nautical miles east of Hulterstad (6.3 km), according to the most recent journal paper about the Kronan: &quot;A cross-staff from the wreck of the Kronan (1676)&quot;, by L. Einarsson and W.F.J. Morzer-Bruyns, International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, 2003, v.32, p.53-60. - [[User:Gump Stump|Gump Stump]] ([[User talk:Gump Stump|talk]]) 08:18, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

== 666 years? ==

In the first paragraph, the article states &quot;after 666 years, the ship foundered...&quot; I think there is an error. Since I do not know anything about this, would someone please research and correct this?[[User:MacEachan1|MacEachan1]] ([[User talk:MacEachan1|talk]]) 04:33, 23 June 2014 (UTC)MacEachan1

==Background info==
Is the first part of the historical background section really necessary? I feel like if people wanted to know about Sweden in the 1600s they would go to [[Swedish empire]] and not an article about a ship. [[User:Brutannica|Brutannica]] ([[User talk:Brutannica|talk]]) 23:45, 23 June 2014 (UTC)

:It's an historical article about a fairly notable warship. A political historical context of the conflicts it was intended to fight in is very relevant in my view. Readers who aren't interested can always just skip those two paragraphs.

== Capitalization ==

[[Swedish Navy]] is capitalized in its own article, but &quot;navy&quot; is lowercase in this one.  Is one or the other wrong? [[User:Curly Turkey|Curly&amp;nbsp;Turkey]]&amp;nbsp;⚞[[User talk:Curly Turkey|''¡gobble!'']]⚟ 03:16, 24 June 2014 (UTC)

:There was a discussion about this in [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Kronan (ship)/archive1|the FAC]]. The linked article is about the modern organization that has a proper name. This is about the early modern predecessor, a very different entity that doesn't really have a proper name like the [[Royal Navy]].
:[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:57, 24 June 2014 (UTC)
::If they're &quot;very different entit[ies]&quot;, then isn't the link misleading? [[User:Curly Turkey|Curly&amp;nbsp;Turkey]]&amp;nbsp;⚞[[User talk:Curly Turkey|''¡gobble!'']]⚟ 06:44, 24 June 2014 (UTC)
:::That goes for all navies with a long history, I suppose. We don't have articles like [[Tudor navy]] for Swedish naval history, though. So it's either the modern navy (which also covers some history) or redlinking. Piping to the former seems like a better choice than simply redlinking.
:::[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:56, 24 June 2014 (UTC)
::::Well, if the article covers both, then shouldn't the article be downcased, with only the portions that cover the modern navy using the capitalized version?  ''Some''thing should be done, anyways—it's confusing. [[User:Curly Turkey|Curly&amp;nbsp;Turkey]]&amp;nbsp;⚞[[User talk:Curly Turkey|''¡gobble!'']]⚟ 07:02, 24 June 2014 (UTC)
:::::[[Swedish Navy]] is about the modern navy first and foremost, just like [[Sweden]] is mostly about the modern country, even if it's technically the same state as in 1676 (or 1523). That doesn't mean we refer to it as &quot;Swedish Empire&quot; as a synonym. I'm not a fan of assigning &quot;official names&quot; when those names aren't used consistently in the literature.
:::::Btw, If you ask WP:MILHIST's naval taskforce about this, they'll likely say &quot;capitalize everything, everywhere&quot;. But that's because something like 98% of their work is on modern history.
