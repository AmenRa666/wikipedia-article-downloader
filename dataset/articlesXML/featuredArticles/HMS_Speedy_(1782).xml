'''HMS ''Speedy''''' was a 14-gun [[Speedy-class brig|''Speedy''-class brig]] of the British [[Royal Navy]]. Built during the last years of the  [[American War of Independence]], she served with distinction during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].

Built at [[Dover]], [[Kent]], ''Speedy'' spent most of the interwar years serving off the British coast. Transferred to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, she spent the rest of her career there under a number of notable commanders, winning fame for herself in various engagements and often against heavy odds. Her first commander in the Mediterranean, [[Charles Cunningham]], served with distinction with several squadrons, assisting in the capture of several [[war prize]]s, such as the French frigates {{HMS|Modeste|1793|2}} and [[HMS Imperieuse (1793)|''Impérieuse'']]. His successor, [[George Cockburn]], impressed his superiors with his dogged devotion to duty. ''Speedy''{{'}}s next commander, [[George Eyre]], had the misfortune to lose her to a superior [[French First Republic|French]] force on 9&amp;nbsp;June 1794.

She was soon retaken, and re-entered service under [[Hugh Downman]], who captured a number of [[privateer]]s between 1795 and 1799 and fought off an attack by the large French privateer ''Papillon'' on 3&amp;nbsp;February 1798. His successor, [[Jahleel Brenton]], fought a number of actions against [[Enlightenment in Spain#Trouble abroad (1788–1808)|Spanish]] forces off [[Gibraltar]]. Her last captain, [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]], forced the surrender of a much larger Spanish warship, the ''[[Spanish frigate El Gamo|Gamo]]''. ''Speedy'' was finally captured by a powerful French squadron in 1801 and donated to the [[Papal Navy]] by [[Napoleon]] the following year. She spent five years with them under the name ''San Paulo'', but was struck around 1806.

==Design and construction==
''Speedy'' was one of two [[Sloop-of-war#Brig sloop|brig-sloops]] built to the same design by Thomas King of [[Dover]], Kent. She and her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|Flirt|1782|6}} were constructed to provide small, fast escort vessels with hulls shaped like a [[cutter (boat)|cutter]], rather than the more seaworthy but slower [[Sloop-of-war|ship-sloop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; King had for some time specialised in these types of vessels, and the design capitalised on that experience. ''Speedy'' was so named to symbolise this new approach, and measured 207 {{frac|21|94}} tons [[Builder's Old Measurement|bm]] with a total length of {{convert|78|ft|3|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; She was armed with fourteen four-pounder and twelve half-pounder [[swivel gun]]s, and carried a complement of 90 men. Ordered on 23&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;1781, she was laid down at King's yard in June that year and launched on 29&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;1782.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colledge&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Colledge |title=Ships of the Royal Navy |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Deptford Dockyard|Deptford]], Kent, to be [[fitting-out|fitted-out]] and have her hull covered with [[Copper sheathing|copper plates]] between 16&amp;nbsp;July and 25&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1782; at her completion she had cost [[pound sterling|£]]4,200&amp;nbsp;7[[Shilling (British coin)|s]]&amp;nbsp;3[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] to build.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;

==Early career==
''Speedy'' was commissioned under [[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] Josias Rogers in May&amp;nbsp;1783 and was assigned to serve in the [[North Sea]], operating out of the [[Humber]] estuary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|During the period ''Speedy'' was commissioned, a sloop was an [[Rating system of the Royal Navy#Unrated vessels|unrated ship]] with between 10 and 18 guns commanded by a commissioned sea officer with the rank of master and commander. After 1794 the rank was shorted to commander, which was considered equivalent to a [[Major (UK)|major]] in the [[British Army|Army]].&lt;ref name=Lavery98&gt;{{Harvnb|Lavery|1989|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} After four years on this station she was [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] (placed in reserve) in January&amp;nbsp;1787 and began a refit at [[Woolwich]] in&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;that year. This work was completed by July at a cost of [[pound sterling|£]]1,801, and she was recommissioned in May that year under Commander John Maude, still on the Humber station.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;/&gt;

From November&amp;nbsp;1790 she was under Commander Richard Lane, who was her captain until she was paid off in October&amp;nbsp;1791. ''Speedy'' then underwent another refit, this time at Deptford between June and December&amp;nbsp;1792, at a cost of £3,000, and was recommissioned in November&amp;nbsp;1792 under Commander [[Charles Cunningham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;/&gt;

==French Revolutionary Wars==
Cunningham had previously been serving in the [[East Indies]] in command of the 16-gun sloop {{HMS|Ariel|1781|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary113&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Annual Biography and Obituary |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he returned to take up his new command the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] had broken out and he was sent to join [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]]{{'s}} fleet in the Mediterranean, arriving there in April&amp;nbsp;1793.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary113&quot;/&gt; He was largely employed in carrying despatches and maintaining communications with other ships scattered throughout the Mediterranean ports. On 5&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1793 ''Speedy'' accompanied {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}} and {{HMS|Captain|1787|6}} into [[Genoa]], where they captured a French [[frigate]], [[HMS Modeste (1793)|''Modeste'']], and two armed [[tartane]]s in the [[Raid on Genoa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary114&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Annual Biography and Obituary |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this action, ''Speedy'' sent two boats to board the tartanes while ''Bedford'' bombarded ''Modeste''. The French crews of the tartanes attempted to resist and two of their crewmembers were wounded, but the British did not suffer any casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;James88&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Captain'' and ''Speedy'' then sailed to the [[Gulf of Spezia]] where they caught another French frigate, [[HMS Imperieuse (1793)|''Imperieuse'']], at anchor. ''Imperieuse'' was [[scuttling|scuttled]] by her crew, but was subsequently salvaged and recommissioned as HMS ''Imperieuse''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary114&quot;/&gt; Cunningham was promoted to captain and given command of the [[prize (law)|prize]], with his commission backdated to the day of the capture, 12&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1793.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary114&quot;/&gt;

Cunningham was replaced by Commander [[George Cockburn]] in the command of ''Speedy'', which remained in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;/&gt; His first duties were limited to carrying despatches and passengers between [[Toulon]] and Genoa, after which he was ordered to join Captain Sutherland of {{HMS|Diadem|1782|6}}, who was commanding a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] blockading Genoa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ralfe259&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ralfe |title=The Naval Biography of Great Britain|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small fleet was caught in winter storms and several ships were badly damaged, forcing Sutherland and his squadron to seek shelter in nearby ports and to make repairs, with the exception of ''Speedy'', which remained on station.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ralfe259&quot;/&gt; Sutherland put into [[Hyères]] Bay and reported the dispersal of his squadron to Lord Hood, also noting that nothing had been heard of ''Speedy'' since the gales. Once ''Diadem'' had been repaired Sutherland returned to Genoa, and was surprised to discover ''Speedy'' still there patrolling the port, not once having left her task. While single-handedly maintaining the blockade, she had managed to capture several vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ralfe260&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ralfe |title=The Naval Biography of Great Britain|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutherland ordered ''Speedy'', which was by now running desperately short of water, to Hyères to refit. At the same time, Sutherland sent a complimentary report of Cockburn to Lord Hood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ralfe260&quot;/&gt; On 20&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;1794, Cockburn was rewarded with an acting commission as [[post-captain]] of the frigate {{HMS|Inconstant|1783|6}}, followed a month later by a permanent command of the frigate {{HMS|Meleager|1785|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ralfe260&quot;/&gt;

Commander [[George Eyre]] took over command of ''Speedy'' in February&amp;nbsp;1794.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;/&gt; ''Speedy'' supported the siege and capture of [[Bastia]], after which Eyre was ordered to join ''Diadem'' off [[Nice]]. While making his way there on 9&amp;nbsp;June, he ran into a French fleet under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Martin (naval officer)|Pierre Martin]], which had sailed from Toulon several days earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ralfe387&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ralfe |title=The Naval Biography of Great Britain|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyre attempted to escape, but the wind and sea favoured the larger vessels, and ''Speedy'' was chased down and captured. Eyre was brought aboard Admiral Martin's flagship and was told that the [[National Convention]] had recently ordered that no quarter should be given to the English or [[Hanoverians]], and that had Martin's ship been first alongside, he would have sunk ''Speedy''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ralfe388&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ralfe |title=The Naval Biography of Great Britain|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden appearance of a British fleet curtailed the interview, and the French hurried back to [[Gourjean]] [[roadstead]] outside Toulon, taking ''Speedy'' and the captured British crew with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ralfe388&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The defeat of the French fleets by [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] at the [[Glorious First of June]] and the subsequent acquisition of large numbers of French prisoners caused the French to abandon the policy of ''guerre à mort'', lest their own men also be shown no quarter. Eyre endured a harsh captivity, but was repatriated, continued to rise through the ranks and died an Admiral and a [[Knight Commander of the Bath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ralfe388&quot;/&gt;|group=Note}}

==Recapture==
''Speedy'' spent only a brief time sailing under the French flag. On 25&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;1795 her captain mistook Captain [[Thomas Fremantle (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Fremantle's]] ''Inconstant'' for a French ship and she was recaptured and taken back into British service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;/&gt;

In early March the following year, ''Speedy'', under the command of Thomas Elphinstone, joined a squadron cruising off [[Oneglia|Oneglia, Italy]], under Commodore [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], consisting of the 64-gun ships {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|6}} and HMS ''Diadem'', the 32-gun frigates {{HMS|Meleager|1785|6}} and {{HMS|Blanche|1786|6}} and the ship-sloop {{HMS|Peterel|1794|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;James309&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April the squadron steered for Laöna bay, the commodore having received intelligence that a large convoy, laden with stores for the French army, had anchored off the town of Finale. When the squadron arrived, however, they found only four vessels moored under the guns of some batteries. The shore batteries opened fire on ''Peterel'' as led the boats of the squadron to the attack. Despite the fire, the British were able to capture the four vessels and suffered only three men wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;James309&quot;/&gt;

In an [[Action of 31 May 1796|action on 31 May]] the squadron chased the French [[ketch]] ''Genie'', a gunboat of one gun, and five merchant ships, which took refuge near the guns of a shore battery. At 3&amp;nbsp;p.m. ''Agamemnon'', ''Blanche'', ''Peterel'' and ''Speedy'' approached them and anchored in {{convert|4|fathom|m}} of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;James309&quot;/&gt; The four British ships fired their cannons, which disabled the shore battery, and then sent in several boats under heavy fire from the guns of ''Genie'' and the gunboat; the British successfully boarded and captured both ships. In the meantime, the merchant ships had beached themselves to avoid capture. Under heavy [[musket]] fire from the beach, the British captured and re-floated the four merchant vessels, and destroyed one. Among the British, one man was killed and three were wounded in the operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;James309&quot;/&gt;

==Downman and Brenton==

He wears a jacket and epaulettes, and the picture is inscribed 'Captain Hugh Downman'.|[[Hugh Downman]], ''Speedy''{{'}}s commander between 1797 and 1799]]
Elphinstone was succeeded in August&amp;nbsp;1797 by Commander [[Hugh Downman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;/&gt; who made several cruises with ''Speedy''. 

During his time in command of ''Speedy'', Downman captured five privateers, altogether mounting 17 guns and 28 [[swivel gun|swivels]], and carrying 162 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM220&quot;/&gt; 

These five were:
*''Dominie Lucas'', captured 1 August;
*''Palma'', captured 13 September;
*''Pilgrim'', captured 21 December;
*''Virin de los Remedios'' (alias ''Olivia''), captured 1 January 1798; and,
*''San JOse'' (alias ''Garalin''), captured 15 March.
Head money was finally paid in June 1829.{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the head money for each of the vessels was worth, in order, [[£sd|£]]39 10[[shilling|s]] 10[[pence|d]], £42 11s 7¼d, £28 17s 11¼d, £53 3s 5¾d, and £65 7s 11½d. The pool for the claimants of the fifth class, comprising able and ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys, was £26 7s 3d, £28 7s 9d, £15 5s 3½d, £35 9s 8½d, and £43 11s 11½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=5 June 1829|issue=18582|startpage=1036}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

On 3&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;1798 ''Speedy'' encountered the large [[privateer]] ''Papillon'', mounting 18 guns and carrying 160 men, while sailing off [[Vigo]]. ''Papillon'' attacked ''Speedy'', which had a reduced crew; her [[Master (naval)|master]] Mr Marshall and 12 men were aboard a Spanish prize ''Speedy'' had taken earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM220&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two ships fought each other for two days; by the second day Downman had exhausted his supply of shot, and resorted to firing nails and pieces of iron hoop at his opponent.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM220&quot;/&gt; Having observed his captain's predicament, Marshall secured the Spanish crew below deck and took the prize crew off in a small boat to go to Downman's assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM220&quot;/&gt; After a fierce fight ''Speedy'' succeeded in driving off Papillon''; ''Speedy'' suffered losses of five killed and four wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM220&quot;/&gt; Downman then recaptured his prize and returned to [[Lisbon]] to carry out repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM220&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall190&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall|title=Royal Naval Biography|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For his efforts in protecting British trade out of [[Oporto]], the merchants there presented him with a letter of thanks, and a [[Silver (household)|piece of plate]] valued at £50.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM220&quot;/&gt; As a reward for his good service, Downman was advanced to [[post-captain]] on 26&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1798 and appointed commander of the 32-gun {{HMS|Santa Dorothea|1798|6}}, a frigate that had recently been captured from the Spanish in the [[Action of 15 July 1798|Action of 15&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;1798]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall190&quot;/&gt;

Downman was succeeded in January of the following year by Commander [[Jahleel Brenton]], who was based at [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson252&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs |page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sailing off Gibraltar in company with the British privateer ''Defender'' on 9&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1799, Brenton came across three small Spanish warships, mounting twenty 6-pounders in total. The Spanish [[Sailing#Running|ran]] into a small sandy bay and anchored in a line so as to bring their guns to bear simultaneously on the British ships.

On 3&amp;nbsp;October ''Speedy'', while sailing once again off Gibraltar, spotted ten small ships coming out of [[Algeciras]], gunboats apparently attempting to attack a British convoy that was then passing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson253&quot;/&gt; Brenton identified the ships as merchantmen, attempting to evade the British at Gibraltar in the bad weather. On ''Speedy''{{'}}s approach, they scattered, four sheltering under a fort. ''Speedy'' approached and fired on them, causing their crews to abandon their ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson254&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs |page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were driven ashore by the wind, and despite sending boats out, it was impossible to get them off, so they were left to be reduced to wrecks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson254&quot;/&gt; Three days later, ''Speedy'' was standing off [[Europa Point]] when twelve gunboats were sighted coming out of Algeciras to attack two merchant ships making their way past Gibraltar. One, the ''Unity'', was carrying wine and spirits for the fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson254&quot;/&gt; Their combined firepower far outweighed that of ''Speedy'', but Brenton turned his ship towards them, covering the escape of one of the merchantmen with his fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson254&quot;/&gt; The gunboats were attempting to catch the ''Unity'' when Brenton took his ship through the flotilla, close enough to break many of their oars, maintaining a constant fire from his guns and with every spare member of the crew firing muskets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson254&quot;/&gt; The Spanish flotilla broke and fled. ''Speedy'' suffered two men killed and one wounded, and sustained considerable damage to her rigging and below her waterline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson254&quot;/&gt; She was unable to return to Gibraltar in the rising wind, and was forced to run along the coast to [[Tétouan]] Bay, where her shot-holes were plugged to allow her to make her way back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson255&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the engagement with the gunboats, the guns in the fortress of Gibraltar had not fired in support of ''Speedy''. When Brenton asked why, the Governor of Gibraltar, General [[Charles O'Hara]], replied that he had arranged with the Governor of Algeciras for the guns never to be fired at the gunboats so as not to annoy the inhabitants of the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson255&quot;/&gt;

He looks to his right, and in his hands he holds a telescope.|Commander [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] achieved some of his most notable exploits with ''Speedy''.]]
Brenton was promoted to [[post-captain]], and in March&amp;nbsp;1800 Commander [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] took over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;/&gt; Cochrane was less than impressed with his new command, declaring that ''Speedy'' was &quot;little more than a burlesque of a vessel of war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly44&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Cochrane the Dauntless |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cabin had only {{convert|5|ft}} of headroom; when Cochrane wished to shave he had to open a skylight and set his shaving equipment out on the quarterdeck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson242&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs |page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion he walked the quarterdeck with ''Speedy''{{'}}s entire broadside, seven pieces of four-pounder shot, in his pockets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson242&quot;/&gt; In an attempt to increase the firepower of his new command he asked for and was given two 12-pounder long guns to use as bow and stern chasers, but the [[scantling]]s could not support them and they had to be removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson242&quot;/&gt; He then requested his 4-pounders be upgraded to 6-pounders, but his gunports were not big enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson242&quot;/&gt; He had better luck with his mast, taking a spar from [[French ship Généreux (1785)|HMS ''Genereux'']] that was considered too large for ''Speedy'', but which Cochrane felt improved her speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson242&quot;/&gt;

In early May Cochrane was escorting a convoy from [[Cagliari]] to [[Livorno|Leghorn]]. On 11&amp;nbsp;May a ship which turned out to be the 6-gun privateer ''Intrépide'' was spotted capturing one of the merchant ships in the convoy, at which point Cochrane chased the ''Intrépide'' and forced her to surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly54&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Cochrane the Dauntless |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, as the convoy passed the island of [[Montecristo]], five rowing boats emerged from one of the island's coves and captured two of the rearmost merchant ships. Cochrane immediately gave chase, and recaptured them early the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly54&quot;/&gt; He was then given a free hand to raid enemy shipping in the area, and captured seven or eight vessels that June and July, including the 10-gun privateer ''Asuncion'' off Bastia on 25&amp;nbsp;June and the privateer ''Constitution'' off [[Caprea]] on 19 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson243&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22&amp;nbsp;September he captured a large Neapolitan vessel and, on bringing her into [[Mahón|Port Mahon]], discovered that the Spanish had taken notice of his [[Raid (military)|depredation]]s and were preparing a frigate to capture ''Speedy''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson243&quot;/&gt;

Cochrane prepared for an encounter with this Spanish vessel by painting ''Speedy'' to resemble a Danish brig then in the Mediterranean, the ''Clomer''. He also appointed a Dane as quartermaster and found him a Danish naval officer's uniform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson244&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cruising off [[Alicante]] on 21 December, ''Speedy'' encountered an enemy frigate, but tricked her into thinking she was a neutral vessel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly56&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Cochrane the Dauntless |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochrane again used this false flag technique to his advantage; on 22&amp;nbsp;January he was sailing with a convoy of Danish merchantmen under a Danish flag, pretending to escort them. When a 10-gun French ship and 8-gun Spanish brig approached, Cochrane hoisted British colours and attacked, capturing both of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly57&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Cochrane the Dauntless |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then on 24 February Cochrane captured the French naval brig ''Caroline'', of four guns, which had been carrying ordnance stores from Genoa to Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=17 November 1801|issue=15428|startpage=1385}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|French records report that ''Caroline'' was a ''biscayenne'' or ''[[trincadour]]'' commissioned at Lorient in June 1798, of only six tons (French), and a crew of 24 men. She originally was armed with one 36-pounder [[obusier de vaisseau|''obusier'']]. She had been sent from Egypt with despatches and was captured in the Bay of Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield and Roberts (2015),p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

===''Speedy'' and ''Gamo''===
{{main article|Action of 6 May 1801}}
[[File:Capture of the El Gamo.jpg|thumb|alt=Oil painting of a naval battle, a small sailing warship in the centre of the painting, close to the stern of a larger warship, covered with climbing figures, to the right. Wreckage and a man float in the foreground, with the background of distant hills and some sailing vessels.|''The Action and Capture of the Spanish Xebeque Frigate El Gamo'', [[Clarkson Frederick Stanfield]]]]
''Speedy'' was cruising off [[Barcelona]] at dawn on 6&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;1801 when she sighted a large enemy frigate. The frigate, a [[xebec]]-rigged vessel named ''[[Spanish frigate El Gamo|Gamo]]'', carrying 319 men, was armed with 8- and 12-pounder guns and 24-pounder [[carronade]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdkinsXXII&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=XXII}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amounted to a total broadside of 190 pounds, more than seven times that of ''Speedy''. Furthermore, Cochrane had only 54 men on board; the rest were serving as prize crews.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdkinsXXIII&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=XXIII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of evading the frigate, Cochrane closed on her, and at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. ''Gamo'' fired a gun and hoisted Spanish colours. In return Cochrane hoisted American colours.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdkinsXXIII&quot;/&gt; The Spanish hesitated, allowing Cochrane to get closer, hoist British colours, and evade the first broadside. ''Gamo'' fired another, which Cochrane again evaded, holding fire until ''Speedy'' ran alongside and locked her [[nautical terms#Y|yards]] in ''Gamo''{{'s}} rigging.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson245&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gamo'' attempted to fire upon her smaller opponent, but her guns were mounted too high and could not be depressed sufficiently, causing their shot to pass through ''Speedy''{{'}}s sails and rigging. Cochrane then opened fire with his 4-pounders [[double-shotted|double- and treble-shotted]], their shots passing up through the sides and decks, killing the Spanish captain and boatswain with the first broadside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson246&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing their disadvantage the Spanish second-in-command assembled a boarding party, at which Cochrane drew off and pounded their massed ranks with shot and musket fire before drawing in close again. After having their attempts to board frustrated three times, the Spanish returned to their guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson246&quot;/&gt; Cochrane then decided to board the ''Gamo'', and assembled his entire crew into two parties, leaving only the ship's doctor aboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdkinsXXIV&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=XXIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British rushed the ''Gamo'', some boarding from the bow with faces blackened to look like pirates, the rest boarding from the [[Nautical terms#W|waist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson246&quot;/&gt; There was a hard-fought battle between the two crews, until Cochrane called down to the doctor, at the time the only person on ''Speedy'', ordering him to send another 50 men over. At the same time he ordered the Spanish colours to be torn down.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdkinsXXV&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=XXV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking that their officers had surrendered the ship, the remaining Spanish seamen stopped fighting. The British had lost three men killed and nine wounded, while the Spanish had lost 14 killed and 41 wounded, a casualty list exceeding ''Speedy''{{'}}s entire complement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson247&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British then secured the Spanish prisoners below deck and made their way back to Port Mahon. Stung that he had been beaten by such an inferior foe, the Spanish second-in-command asked Cochrane for a certificate assuring him that he had done all he could to defend his ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdkinsXXV&quot;/&gt; Cochrane obliged, with the equivocal wording that he had &quot;conducted himself like a true Spaniard&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdkinsXXV&quot;/&gt; Cochrane was amused to learn that this certificate had later secured the Spanish officer further advancement.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdkinsXXV&quot;/&gt; In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]] with clasp &quot;Speedy 6 May 1801&quot; to all surviving claimants from the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20939|startpage=240|date=26 January 1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later actions and capture===
Cochrane returned to the coast off Barcelona in June&amp;nbsp;1801, and joined the 16-gun {{HMS|Kangaroo|1795|6}} in attacking a Spanish convoy of 12 merchant ships and 5 armed vessels anchored under the guns of a large tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly61&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Cochrane the Dauntless |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a sharp action fought between the afternoon of 9&amp;nbsp;June and the morning of 10&amp;nbsp;June, the two ships sank or drove ashore all of the ships with the exception of three brigs, which they captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly61&quot;/&gt; Three weeks later he was cruising off Alicante when he encountered several merchant vessels, which ran ashore. Rather than wasting time trying to get them off, he burnt them, but in doing so attracted the attention of a foe vastly more powerful than the ''Gamo''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly62&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Cochrane the Dauntless |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A formidable French squadron under the command of Rear-Admiral [[Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois]] had left Toulon bound for [[Cadiz]] to collect reinforcements for Napoleon's army in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly62&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|This consisted of the 80-gun ships [[French ship Formidable (1795)|''Formidable'']] and [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']], the 74-gun [[French ship Tyrannicide (1793)|''Desaix'']], and the 40-gun [[French frigate Muiron|''Muiron'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly62&quot;/&gt;|group=Note}} On 3&amp;nbsp;July they sighted and chased ''Speedy'', and Cochrane ordered the guns, boats, and provisions thrown overboard to lighten the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly63&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Cochrane the Dauntless |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French caught up nonetheless, and after narrowly avoiding the broadside of ''Desaix'', Cochrane [[striking the colors|struck his colours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Colledge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly63&quot;/&gt; He was taken aboard ''Desaix'', where her captain, [[Jean-Anne Christy de la Pallière|Christy-Pallière]], recognised Cochrane's accomplishments by refusing to accept his sword.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly63&quot;/&gt; Cochrane was taken along with the fleet and watched the [[Battle of Algeciras Bay]] from ''Desaix''. He and the crew of ''Speedy'' were later exchanged after the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly64&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Cochrane the Dauntless |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to Gibraltar he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship, and honourably acquitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly67&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Cochrane the Dauntless |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The court-martial was held aboard the 80-gun {{HMS|Pompee|1793|6}} on 18&amp;nbsp;July 1801.

==French and Papal career==
The French took ''Speedy'' to Toulon with the fleet, where she became a pawn in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Napoleon and the Catholic Church|efforts at diplomacy]] with [[Pope Pius VII]], whose presence he wanted at his coronation as emperor. ''Speedy'', by now named ''Saint Paul'' and inscribed with the words &quot;Donné par le premier consul Bonaparte au Pape Pie VII&quot; (&quot;Given by the [[First Consul]] Bonaparte to Pope Pius VII&quot;) in gilt letters on her [[poop cabin]], sailed with an escort from Toulon on 14&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1802 bound for [[Civitavecchia]] as a present to the Pope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly65&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Cochrane the Dauntless |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived there on 16 December where the [[Papal Navy]] took her into service under the name ''San Paulo''. She remained there until being struck c.1806.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield and Roberts (2015), p.&amp;nbsp;211.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|''San Paulo'' was one of two vessels that Napoleon gave to the Papal Navy at the same time.

==HMS ''Sophie''==
Some of ''Speedy''{{'}}s later exploits under Cochrane were used in the plot of the novel ''[[Master and Commander]]'', part of [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[Aubrey–Maturin series]], though the ship described by O'Brian matches only ''Speedy''{{'s}} [[spar (sailing)|spar]] dimensions and armament, and is named HMS ''Sophie''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parrill&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Parrill|title=Nelson's Navy in Fiction and Film|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt|title=The Marine Art of Geoff Hunt|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochrane is replaced in the book by the fictional [[Jack Aubrey]], who repeats many of Cochrane's real-life exploits including the defence of a convoy and the recapture of one of its merchants from a privateer, and the capture of a large Spanish frigate, based on the ''Gamo'', but renamed ''Cacafuego'' for the novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parrill167-9&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Parrill|title=Nelson's Navy in Fiction and Film|pages=167–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
