'''No. 62 Commando''' or the '''Small Scale Raiding Force''' ('''SSRF''') was a [[British Commandos|British Commando]] unit of the [[British Army during the Second World War]]. The unit was formed around a small group of commandos under the command of the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE). They carried out a number of raids before being disbanded in 1943.

==Background==
The commandos were formed in 1940 by order of [[Winston Churchill]], the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. He called for specially trained troops who would &quot;develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  At first they were a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids in enemy-occupied territory,&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1943 their role had changed and they had become lightly equipped assault infantry specialising in spearheading amphibious landings.&lt;ref&gt;Moreman, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The man initially selected as the commander of the force was [[Admiral]] Sir [[Roger Keyes]], himself a veteran of the landings at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Galipoli]] and the [[Zeebrugge raid]] during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]].&lt;ref name=haw48/&gt;

By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training and what became known as the [[Special Service Brigade]] was formed into 12 units called Commandos.&lt;ref name=haw48&gt;Haskew, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Each Commando numbered about 450 men and was commanded by a [[lieutenant colonel]]. Each was divided into [[troops]] of 75 men and further divided into [[Section (military unit)|sections]] of 15 men.&lt;ref name=haw48/&gt; Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments, and retained their own [[cap badge]]s and remained on their regimental rolls for pay.&lt;ref name=mo12&gt;Moreman, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; All volunteers went through a six-week intensive commando course at [[Achnacarry]] in the Scottish Highlands, which concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations, and demolitions both by day and by night.&lt;ref&gt;van der Bijl, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1943 the Commandos had moved away from small raiding operations and most of them had been formed into [[brigade]]s of assault infantry to spearhead future Allied landing operations. Three units were left unbrigaded to carry out smaller scale raids.&lt;ref&gt;Moreman, pp.84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
No. 62 Commando, formed in 1941, consisted of a small group of 55 commando-trained personnel working under the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), where it was also known as the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF).&lt;ref name=ch48&gt;Chappell, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Under the operational control of [[Combined Operations Headquarters]], No. 62 Commando was commanded by [[Major]] [[Gus March-Phillips|Gustavus Henry March-Phillipps]].&lt;ref&gt;Foot, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; Its first operation, [[Operation Postmaster]], was in January 1942, when March-Phillipps led the seizure of an Italian liner, a German tanker and a yacht from [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]].&lt;ref name=ch48/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=4 May 2010|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''|title=Shall We Have a Bash, Chaps?|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3639355/Shall-we-have-a-bash-chaps.html | location=London | first=Max | last=Hastings | date=27 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The SSRF used HM MTB 344, a [[motor torpedo boat]] nicknamed ''The Little Pisser'' because of its outstanding turn of speed. The SSRF carried out a number of cross-[[English Channel|channel]] operations, but had mixed fortunes. [[Operation Barricade]] and [[Operation Dryad]] were complete successes, but [[Operation Aquatint]], on 12/13 September 1942 at [[Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes|Sainte-Honorine]] on the coast of [[Normandy]], resulted in the loss of all the men involved, including March-Phillipps.&lt;ref name=ch48/&gt;  One member of the raiding party, Captain [[Graham Hayes]] MC, managed to reach France and eventually made his way to Spain, but was betrayed by a French double agent and handed to the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Fournier and Andre Heintz, ''If I Must Die'', p. 212 ISBN 978-2-915762-05-1&lt;/ref&gt; After nine months' solitary confinement in [[Fresnes Prison]] he was shot on 13 July 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p.62.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the loss of March-Phillipps, Major [[Geoffrey Appleyard]] was given command.&lt;ref name=ho33&gt;Howarth, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; On 3/4 October 1942 the SSRF carried out a raid on the Channel Island of [[Sark]], codenamed [[Operation Basalt]], with men from [[No. 12 Commando]] attached. After the raid a number of dead and wounded Germans were found tied up (they had been shot while trying to escape), which resulted in the prisoners captured in the [[Dieppe raid]] being tied up and the [[Commando Order]] ordering the execution of all captured commandos.&lt;ref name=ch48/&gt;

In early 1943 No. 62 Commando was disbanded and its members were dispersed among other formations. A number went to the [[Middle East]] and served in the [[Special Boat Service|Special Boat Squadron]], most notably Major [[Anders Lassen]], the only member of the [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] ever awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref name=ch48/&gt; Appleyard also went to the Middle East and helped to form the  2nd [[Special Air Service]] from a detachment of No. 62 Commando under the command of [[Bill Stirling]], elder brother of [[David Stirling]]. Neither Lassen nor Appleyard survived the war.&lt;ref name=ho33/&gt;
