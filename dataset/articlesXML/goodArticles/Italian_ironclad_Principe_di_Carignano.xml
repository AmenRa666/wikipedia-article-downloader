'''''Principe di Carignano''''' was the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass-|Principe di Carignano|ironclad|4}} of [[ironclad warship]]s built for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' in the 1860s. She was the first ironclad built in Italy; her [[keel]] was laid January 1861, her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched in September 1863, and she was completed in June 1865. ''Principe di Carignano'' was a [[broadside ironclad]] armed with a battery of ten {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} guns and twelve {{convert|164|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} guns.

''Principe di Carignano'' saw action during the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] in 1866 during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]]. There, she led the Italian [[line of battle|line]], the [[flagship]] of Admiral [[Giovanni Vacca (naval officer)|Giovanni Vacca]]; the leading squadron of the Italian fleet became separated from the rest of the fleet and was not heavily engaged. Her career was limited after the war, owing to the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. The ship was stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1875 and [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap to free up funds needed for new ironclads under construction.

==Design==
{{main|Principe di Carignano-class ironclad}}

''Principe di Carignano'' was {{convert|72.98|m|sp=us}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]]; she had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|15.1|m|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7.18|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|3446|MT|LT|sp=us}} normally and up to {{convert|3912|MT|LT|sp=us|abbr=on}} at full load. She had a crew of 572. Her propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion [[steam engine]] that drove a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by four coal-fired, rectangular [[fire-tube boiler]]s. Her engine produced a top speed of {{convert|10.4|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|1968|ihp|lk=in}}. She could steam for about {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. To supplement her steam engine, the ship was [[barquentine]]-rigged.&lt;ref name=G338/&gt;

''Principe di Carignano'' was a [[broadside ironclad]], and she was armed with a [[main battery]] of ten 72-pounder {{convert|8|in|abbr=on}} guns and twelve {{convert|164|mm|abbr=on}} [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading]] guns. The ship was equipped with a [[spur]]-shaped [[naval ram|ram]] at the bow. The ship's hull was sheathed with [[wrought iron]] armor that was {{convert|4.75|in|abbr=on|0}} thick.&lt;ref name=G338/&gt;

==Service history==
''Principe di Carignano'' was laid down at the [[Cantiere della Foce]] shipyard in [[Genoa]] in January 1861, the first Italian ironclad to be domestically produced. She was launched on 15 September 1863 and was completed on 11 June 1865. She was the only member of her class ready for service by the time the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] broke out between Italy and the [[Austrian Empire]] in June 1866, which was fought concurrently with the [[Austro-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name=G338&gt;Gardiner, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S1&gt;Sondhaus (1994), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian fleet commander, Admiral [[Carlo Pellion di Persano]], initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austrian Navy]], despite the fact that the Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own. Persano claimed he was simply waiting on the ironclad ram {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}, ''en route'' from Britain, but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet, with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 217&amp;ndash;222&lt;/ref&gt;

Rear Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] brought the Austrian fleet to [[Ancona]] on June 27, in an attempt to draw out the Italians. At the time, many of the Italian ships were in disarray; ''Principe di Carignano'' had not yet received her heavy 8-inch guns, and other ships were experiencing various difficulties with their engines or armament. Nevertheless, ''Principe di Carignano'' formed up with the ironclads {{ship|Italian ironclad|San Martino||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Regina Maria Pia||2}}, and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Castelfidardo||2}} in preparation to confront Tegetthoff. Persano held a council of war aboard ''Principe di Carignano'' to determine whether he should sortie to engage Tegetthoff, but by that time, the Austrians had withdrawn, making the decision moot. The Minister of the Navy, [[Agostino Depretis]], urged Persano to act and suggested the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], to restore Italian confidence after their defeat at the [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]] the previous month. On 7 July, Persano left Ancona and conducted a sweep into the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], but encountered no Austrian ships and returned on the 13th.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 216&amp;ndash;218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Lissa===
[[File:Battle of Lissa - 1866 - Initial Situation.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing the disposition of the fleets on 20 July]]
{{see also|Battle of Lissa (1866)}}

On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet out of Ancona, bound for Lissa, where they arrived on the 18th. With them, they brought troop transports carrying 3,000 soldiers; the Italian warships began bombarding the Austrian forts on the island, with the intention of landing the soldiers once the fortresses had been silenced. In response, the Austrian Navy sent the fleet under Tegetthoff to attack the Italian ships.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus (1994), pp. 1&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Principe di Carignano'' was at that time the [[flagship]] of Admiral [[Giovanni Vacca (naval officer)|Giovanni Vacca]], commander of the 1st Division, along with the ironclads {{ship|Italian ironclad|Ancona||2}} and ''Castelfidardo''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving off Lissa on the 18th,&lt;ref name=S1/&gt; Persano ordered the 1st Division to bombard the Austrian fortresses protecting the island, but Vacca informed him that his ships' guns could not elevate high enough to hit the high fortifications. Persano then sent Vacca's division to [[Vis (town)|Vis]] to force the harbor defenses, but by the time they arrived, night was approaching, and so he cancelled the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 221&amp;ndash;222&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, Persano ordered the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Formidabile||2}} to enter Vis harbor and attack the Madonna [[artillery battery|battery]], supported by ''Principe di Carignano'' and the rest of the 1st Division. Vacca found it impossible to employ his ships in the confined waters, and so he left ''Formidabile'' to handle the battery. With the day's attacks again having yielded no results, Persano decided to make another attempt on the 20th. Vacca would take his three ships to patrol to the north-east of the island while the rest of the fleet would again try to land the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 221&amp;ndash;224&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Italians could begin the attack, the [[dispatch boat]] {{ship|Italian dispatch boat|Esploratore||2}} arrived, bringing news of Tegetthoff's approach. Persano's fleet was in disarray; Vacca's ships were three miles to the northeast from Persano's main force, and three other ironclads were further away to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 223&amp;ndash;225&lt;/ref&gt; Persano immediately ordered his ships to form up with Vacca's, first in [[line abreast]] formation, and then in [[line ahead]] formation. ''Principe di Carignano'' led the Italian line.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the action began, Persano left his flagship, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}}, and transferred to the [[turret ship]] ''Affondatore'', though none of his subordinates on the other ships were aware of the change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping ''Re d'Italia'', he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships and the rest of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 233&lt;/ref&gt; ''Principe di Carignano'' opened fire first at 10:43, at a range of about {{convert|1000|yd}}, while the Austrians were approaching the gap.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian gunnery was poor, and their initial shooting missed the Austrian ships. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships in an attempt to initiate a melee, though he failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians then turned back toward Persano's ships, and took ''Re d'Italia'', ''San Martino'', and the [[coastal defense ship]] {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Palestro||2}} under heavy fire.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 234&amp;ndash;235&lt;/ref&gt; Vacca turned ''Principe di Carignano'' and ''Castelfidardo'' to port, taking them away from the Austrian ships hammering Persano's division. He briefly attempted to engage the Austrian wooden ships in the rear, but was driven off by heavy fire from three steam [[frigate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

''Principe di Carignano'', ''Castelfidardo'', and the coastal defense ship {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Varese||2}} engaged the wooden [[ship of the line]] {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|2}}, but failed to inflict fatal damage to her before she withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, ''Re d'Italia'' had been rammed and sunk, and ''Palestro'' had been set on fire, soon to be destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, Persano refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and [[Pula|Pola]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 238&amp;ndash;241, 250&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the battle, ''Principe di Carignano'' had had one of her armor plates shattered by Austrian shells, and one of her guns had exploded.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; In return, ''Principe di Carignano'' hit the Austrian ironclad {{SMS|Drache}} and killed the ship's commander.&lt;ref name=O334/&gt;

===Later career===
After the battle, Vacca replaced Persano; he was ordered to attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's postwar career was limited;&lt;ref name=O334&gt;Ordovini et al., p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; rapidly surpassed first by [[central battery ship|central battery]] and then turret ships, the first generation of ironclads with traditional broadside quickly became obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus (2001), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the government lost confidence in the fleet after the defeat at Lissa and drastically reduced the naval budget. The cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of [[Civitavecchia]] in September 1870, as part of the [[Italian unification|wars of Italian unification]]. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors [[conscript]]ed to man them were sent home.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1870, the ship's armament was revised to four 8&amp;nbsp;in guns and sixteen 164&amp;nbsp;cm guns.&lt;ref name=G338/&gt; ''Principe di Carignano'' was stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1875 and subsequently [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap.&lt;ref name=G338/&gt; The Navy discarded both of her sisters, along with the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}} between 1875 and 1880 to remove the cost of maintaining them from the naval budget, as part of an effort to reduce the financial impact of the new {{sclass-|Caio Duilio|ironclad|5}} and {{sclass-|Italia|ironclad|0}}es then under construction.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus (1994), p. 50&amp;ndash;51&lt;/ref&gt;
