== Title ==
Shouldn't we mention in title the bombing was executed in Beirut?[[User:Greyshark09|'''''GreyShark''''']] ([[User talk:Greyshark09|''dibra'']]) 20:37, 19 November 2013 (UTC)
:Is that really necessary? This is so far the only bombing of an Iranian embassy in 2013.--[[User:FutureTrillionaire|FutureTrillionaire]] ([[User talk:FutureTrillionaire|talk]]) 21:45, 19 November 2013 (UTC)
::Think it's too ambiguous. Could refer to Iran's alleged bombing of other embassies. This eliminates any ambiguities. [[User:Plot Spoiler|Plot Spoiler]] ([[User talk:Plot Spoiler|talk]]) 21:50, 19 November 2013 (UTC)
:::But what about [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] and [[1983 United States embassy bombing]]?--[[User:FutureTrillionaire|FutureTrillionaire]] ([[User talk:FutureTrillionaire|talk]]) 00:04, 20 November 2013 (UTC)

I propose [[2013 Beirut embassy bombing]].  Hopefully it'll still be the only 2013 embassy bombing in the city by the end of this year... -[[User:Helvetica|Helvetica]] ([[User talk:Helvetica|talk]]) 22:25, 19 November 2013 (UTC)
:Agreed. Moved. --[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]&lt;sup&gt; [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:09, 19 November 2013 (UTC)

I propose that we follow the format of the following articles:
*[[2008 Danish embassy bombing in Islamabad]]
*[[2003 Jordanian embassy bombing in Baghdad]]
*[[2008 Indian embassy bombing in Kabul]]
*[[2004 Australian Embassy bombing in Jakarta]]
For this article, we'd just need to add &quot;in Beirut&quot; at the end.--[[User:FutureTrillionaire|FutureTrillionaire]] ([[User talk:FutureTrillionaire|talk]]) 00:07, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
:::This is the only Iranian embassy bombings Im currently aware of. Iranian embassy bombings should do it. Inline with the 2 moves conducted today (reverted TWICE) and ive moved it too in accord with those.
:::Also bera in mind OSEv [[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 01:26, 20 November 2013 (UTC)

&quot;In Beirut&quot; is unnecessary because there have been no other bombings at any another Iranian embassies in 2013, as of yet. But I'm not sure why &quot;2013&quot; was subsequently removed from the title. &quot;Iranian embasssy bombings&quot; by itself is a little bit too ambiguous IMHO. Having the year in the title gives the reader a reference point, therefore &quot;2013 Iranian embassy bombing&quot; a la [[1983 United States embassy bombing]] is the most desirable title. --[[User:Tocino|Tocino]] 03:49, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
::Has there been another Iranian embassy bombing? (or bombings at that) If so then we could add caveats.([[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 14:24, 20 November 2013 (UTC)).
:::There were some explosions in the [[Iranian Embassy siege]]. --[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]&lt;sup&gt; [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:29, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
::::&quot;Iranian embassy bombings&quot; is the worst of the titles -- ambiguous and outlets aren't using the plural form. There were multiple explosions but its still called a singular bombing. The 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut is simply entitled &quot;[[1983 United States embassy bombing]]&quot;. I don't see a really compelling reason as to why this should be different. [[User:Plot Spoiler|Plot Spoiler]] ([[User talk:Plot Spoiler|talk]]) 15:01, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
:::::The reason to use plural because there was more than 1. OSE is not a reason, nor is the media a reason for WP. Mere encyclopaedic FACT indicates more than one.
:::::And because you deemed it the worst of all titles is not a reason to move while saying we need to discuss. the discussion is ongoing!([[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 18:48, 21 November 2013 (UTC)).
::::::As you say, the discussion is ongoing, so don't force change when there is no [[WP:consensus]]. [[User:Plot Spoiler|Plot Spoiler]] ([[User talk:Plot Spoiler|talk]]) 22:34, 21 November 2013 (UTC)
:::::::You said so first, the discussion was this BEFORE YOU moved it. Sorry no you dont have control!
:::::::And while moving it to your version you added NOTHING about the discussion yet insist purly on your personal whim thatit should fit this. So to you: &quot; so don't force change when there is no [[WP:consensus]]&quot;([[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 18:43, 22 November 2013 (UTC)).

== Analysis ==
[[User:Lihaas]] has now twice removed the analysis section (violating the 1RR here incidentally), calling it POV. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iranian_embassy_bombings&amp;diff=582459182&amp;oldid=582458824 1st revert], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iranian_embassy_bombings&amp;diff=582461551&amp;oldid=582461298 revert2]. I can assure you that from my desk in [[Norwich]] I have no partisan opinions regarding the Syrian conflict. The section is fully cited and reflects the reliable sources (mostly the Financial Times). Please can a third party look at this. --[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]&lt;sup&gt; [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:44, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
::OOps, I ll restore it. Sorry dint know this was 1RR at its not ARBPIA.
::The content is not YOUR partisan opinion it is that of the source. The ifirst sentence could go in to backgroundbut it is rather UNDUE on this page, Still I would settle for it there.
::As for being seen as a spillover from the Qalamoun conflict that is dubious as it has happened on the SAME day, so to coordinate and perpetrate that in a few hours is highly unlikely if not impossible. That was a spillover is fine (but again in background). As for th elast person that's worthy of analysis, but since its just the 1 section maybe as a subjeading of reactions([[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 14:05, 20 November 2013 (UTC)).
:::Restored all content and just moved per babove. Better?([[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 14:10, 20 November 2013 (UTC)).
::::On a slightly different topic, are you ok with removing the expand tag in the Bombing section, Lihaas? It's still a bit thin but I can't find much else that feels encyclopedic to add there. [[User:Espresso Addict|Espresso Addict]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Espresso Addict|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:17, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
::::Thank you. I am satisfied the 'background' section now gives sufficient context. I would also agree the expand tag could be removed. --[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]&lt;sup&gt; [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:22, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
:::::It should have a lot more, but that fine. And it seems someone has taken it([[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 18:51, 21 November 2013 (UTC)).
{{resolved}}

== Responsibility ==
The Responsibility section was rewritten in a way that seemed to me to put undue weight on the notion of Israeli involvement. I have attempted to refactor this in a more neutral fashion, but more editing might be needed. The main reference added was to RT [http://rt.com/news/iran-beirut-attack-israel-952/], a Russian news service; I've never heard of this and don't have any idea whether it is reliable; an independent reference for &quot;The group has made false claims in the past&quot; would be helpful. Also, the 2010 BBC reference quoted (&quot;a name of convenience rather than an actual organisation&quot;) seems out of date; can a subject expert confirm what the current status is considered to be? [[User:Espresso Addict|Espresso Addict]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Espresso Addict|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 05:54, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
:RT is like France24, Al Jazeera, BBC, etc. Its fine.
:Not sure how it had undue weight against Israel, but that is not in the reactiosn section anyways. Th e actual claimants are thre. SO resolved?([[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 14:21, 20 November 2013 (UTC)).
::The [[RT (TV network)]] article discusses the channel quite well. I can get it on my TV and it's clearly held within arms' reach of the Russian state. --[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]&lt;sup&gt; [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:03, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
:::Okay. It was being used to support a (to my mind) very anti-Israel edit, which made me suspicious. [[User:Espresso Addict|Espresso Addict]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Espresso Addict|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:20, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
::::Personally I'd take out ''&quot;The group has made false claims in the past,[12] and expert analysis in 2010 considered this is &quot;a name of convenience rather than an actual organisation&quot;.[13]&quot;'' entirely. The Iranian claim of Isreali involvement is there. There's no need to add statements in such a way as to seeming hint on a judgement of the Iranian claim. --[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]&lt;sup&gt; [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:54, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
:::::Concur. Gets us into [[WP:Fringe]], [[WP:Undue]]. [[User:Plot Spoiler|Plot Spoiler]] ([[User talk:Plot Spoiler|talk]]) 16:08, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
::::::Done. I should probably have been more ruthless in the first place. [[User:Espresso Addict|Espresso Addict]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Espresso Addict|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:16, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
::::::::Disagree as its going to another POV. The context here is notable[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 18:38, 21 November 2013 (UTC)</text>
