'''John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|KG|KB}} (8 September 1442 – 10 March 1513), the second son of [[John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford]], and Elizabeth Howard, was one of the principal [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] commanders during the English [[Wars of the Roses]].

He was the principal commander of [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII's]] army at the [[Battle of Bosworth]], and again led Henry's troops to victory at the [[Battle of Stoke]] two years later. He became one of the great men of the King's regime.

==Early life==
John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, was born on 8 September 1442, the second son of [[John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford]] (23 April 1408 - 26 February 1462), and his wife Elizabeth Howard (c.1410-1474), the daughter of Sir John Howard and Joan Walton.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=238}}{{sfn|Gunn|2004}}

In February 1462 the 12th Earl, his eldest son, Aubrey de Vere, and [[Thomas Tuddenham|Sir Thomas Tuddenham]], the 12th Earl's former political opponent in Norfolk and now a fellow [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] loyalist, were convicted of [[high treason]] before [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester]], [[Lord High Constable of England|Constable of England]], for plotting against [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]]. The 12th Earl was beheaded on [[Tower Hill]] on 26 February 1462, and buried in the church of [[Austin Friars]] in London. His son Aubrey had been beheaded on the same scaffold six days earlier.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=237–238}}{{sfn|Kohl|2004}}{{sfn|Castor|2004}}

Pursuing a conciliatory policy with Lancastrian families, King Edward allowed John de Vere to succeed his father, and on 18 January 1464 granted him licence to enter on his father's lands. On 26 May 1465 he was created a [[Knight of the Bath]] at the coronation of Edward IV's wife, [[Elizabeth Woodville]], and officiated at the ceremony as both [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], in the absence of the then office-holder, the [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], and as Chamberlain to the queen. In November 1468, however, he was committed to the Tower, and confessed to plotting with the Lancastrians against the King. He was likely released before 7 January 1469, and received a general pardon on 5 April of that year. However, by early July 1469 Oxford had joined the discontented Yorkists led by his brother-in-law, the Earl of Warwick, and King Edward's brother, the [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Duke of Clarence]], for the [[Edgecote]] campaign. He fled overseas in the following spring to the court of King Henry VI's wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]]. In September 1470 he joined Warwick and Clarence in the invasion of England which restored Henry VI to the throne, and on 13 October bore the [[Crown Jewels of England|Sword of State]] before Henry in a procession to [[St. Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]]. He was appointed [[Lord High Constable of England]], and as such on 15 October tried and condemned for high treason the same Earl of Worcester who had in 1462 condemned Oxford's own father and brother.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=239–240}}{{sfn|Kohl|2004}}{{sfn|Gunn|2004}}

In March 1471, he prevented Edward IV's army from landing in [[Norfolk]], and was in command of the right wing at the [[Battle of Barnet]] on 14 April of that year, defeating the forces of [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|Lord Hastings]]. However this early success in the battle turned to disaster when Oxford's forces began pillaging. Oxford led his men back to the fight, but:

&lt;blockquote&gt;they lost their way in the fog and suddenly emerged on their own army, who mistook the Vere star for Edward's sun in splendour, and met them with a flight of arrows. Whereupon Oxford and his men cried &quot;Treasoune! treasoune&quot; and fled.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=240–241}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After this defeat Oxford escaped to Scotland with 40 men, accompanied by his two brothers, George and Thomas Vere, and the [[William Beaumont, 2nd Viscount Beaumont|Viscount Beaumont]]. From there he went to France, where he collected ships and engaged in [[privateering]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=241}}{{sfn|Gunn|2004}} Although he was not attainted after leaving England in 1471, his lands were confiscated, and his wife, Margaret, is said to have been subjected to great financial hardship.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=240}}{{sfn|Gunn|2004}} On 28 May 1473, Oxford attempted an unsuccessful landing at [[St Osyth]] in [[Essex]]. On 30 September 1473, he seized [[St Michael's Mount]] in [[Cornwall]], where he was besieged for some months by John Fortescue. After most of his men had deserted and he had been wounded in the face with an arrow, Oxford was eventually compelled to surrender on 15 February 1474, along with his two brothers and Beaumont.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=240}}{{sfn|Gunn|2004}}

[[File:St. Peter and Paul Church, Lavenham, Suffolk.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Church of St Peter and Paul, Lavenham, Suffolk]]

Oxford was imprisoned at Hammes Castle near [[Calais]], and was [[attainder|attainted]] early in 1475.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=241}}{{sfn|Kohl|2004}} At this time his mother, the 12th Earl's widow, was forced to surrender her property to the [[Richard III of England|Duke of Gloucester]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=238, 241}} In 1478 Oxford scaled the walls of Hammes and leapt into the moat, though whether this was an attempt at escape or suicide is unclear. The new king, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], ordered his transfer to England on 28 October 1484, but before the transfer could be effected Oxford had escaped, having persuaded the captain of Hammes, Sir [[James Blount]], to go with him to join the [[Henry VII of England|Earl of Richmond]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=241}}{{sfn|Gunn|2004}} It is said that Richmond was &quot;ravished with joy incredible&quot; at this event. Oxford immediately returned to Hammes to bring the garrison there to join Richmond.{{sfn|Gunn|2004}}

Oxford commanded the [[Archery|archer]]s and Henry's vanguard using the formation called the Oxford Wedge, which penetrated Richard's army in the shape of an arrow at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Battle of Bosworth]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=241}} and held Richmond's [[vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]] in fierce fighting in which the [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], who was leading the vanguard of Richard III, was killed.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=241}}{{sfn|Gunn|2004}}  To celebrate the Tudor victory at Bosworth, Oxford commissioned the building of the church of St. Peter and St. Paul, [[Lavenham]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Service under Henry VII==
According to Gunn, Oxford was 'immediately recognized as one of the great men of Henry VII's regime'. His attainder was repealed, he was restored to his estates and titles, and received many appointments and grants, including appointment as [[Lord High Admiral of England|Lord Admiral]] on 21 September, and chief steward of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] south of Trent and [[Constable of the Tower|Constable of the Tower of London]] on 22 September 1485. He was also appointed the first [[Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard]]. He was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], and recognized as Hereditary [[Lord Great Chamberlain of England]]. As Lord Great Chamberlain he officiated at the coronations of Henry VII and [[Elizabeth of York]], bearing the king's train at the coronation and setting the crown upon the king's head at the coronation banquet.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=241}}{{sfn|Gunn|2004}} By 1486 he had been invested with the [[Order of the Garter]]. He was present at most great court occasions, and stood godfather to the king's eldest son, [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], in 1486, bestowing on his godson a gift of a pair of basins with a cup of assay, all gilt.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=242}}{{sfn|Gunn|2004}}

Nor were Oxford's fighting days over. In 1487, he commanded the vanguard at [[Battle of Stoke Field|Stoke]], the last battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]], was in [[Picardy]] in 1492, and in 1497 was one of the commanders against the Cornish rebels at [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497|Blackheath]]. He presided as [[Lord High Steward of England|Lord High Steward]] at the trial of the [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] on 21 November 1499.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=242}} By 1499, Oxford's yearly landed income had risen to £1600. He entertained the king regularly on his progresses. However, [[Sir Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon's]] story that Henry VII imposed an enormous fine on the Earl for illegally bringing together more than the allowed number of [[Retainer (medieval)|retainers]] to welcome the king is likely apocryphal.{{sfn|Gunn|2004}}{{sfn|Ross|2011|pp=141–2}}

==Last years==
On the accession of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] Oxford continued in high favour, and officiated as Lord Great Chamberlain at the coronation. He resided at [[Wivenhoe]] and [[Castle Hedingham]] in Essex, and added to the 12th-century [[keep]] of the latter and constructed a new great hall and several towers. His [[jousting]] [[helmet|helm]] is in the [[Bargello]] in [[Florence]]. According to Gunn, he 'kept an outstanding chapel choir', and commissioned [[William Caxton|Caxton's]] edition of ''The Four Sons of Aymon'' in 1489.{{sfn|Gunn|2004}} Oxford also kept a playing company whose recorded performances span the years 1492-1499.{{sfn|Lancashire|1984|p=407}}

Oxford died on 10 March 1513 at Castle Hedingham and was buried 24 April at [[Colne Priory, Essex|Colne Priory]]. He had no issue by either of his two marriages, and was succeeded as Earl by his nephew, [[John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford]], the second but only surviving son of [[Sir George Vere]], third son of the 12th Earl, and his wife, Margaret Stafford, the daughter and heir of Sir William Stafford of [[Bishops Frome]], [[Hereford]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=243}}

==Marriages==
Oxford married firstly, Margaret Neville, the daughter of [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], by [[Alice Montagu, Countess of Salisbury|Alice]], the daughter of [[Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury]]. Oxford's first wife was the sister of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], the Kingmaker.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=243}}{{sfn|Ross|2011|p=50}}

Margaret Neville died between 20 November 1506 and 14 January 1507,{{sfn|Ross|2011|p=204}} and Oxford married secondly Elizabeth Scrope, the widow of his colleague [[William Beaumont, 2nd Viscount Beaumont|William, 2nd Viscount Beaumont]], and daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Scrope, the second son of [[Henry, 4th Baron Scrope of Bolton]], by Eleanor, the daughter of Norman Washbourne.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|p=243}}

He is said to have had an illegitimate daughter, Katherine de Vere (d. after 20-06-1504), who married [[Robert Broughton (died 1506)|Sir Robert Broughton]], 'one of the richest non-baronial landowners in England'.{{sfn|Ross|2011|p=187}} Broughton appointed the 13th Earl as supervisor of his will.{{sfn|Ross|2011|p=187}}

Sir Robert Broughton and Katherine de Vere had two sons and a daughter:
