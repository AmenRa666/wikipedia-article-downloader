== Islands campaigns ==
Given how controversial the Australian Army's 1944-45 campaigns in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville were, it would be interesting if the article covered Sturdee's views on their value and/or how the controversy impacted on the strategy he implemented. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 10:36, 26 November 2009 (UTC)
: I included a quotation from a letter to Savige giving some details about how the political controversy was affecting operations. Sturdee hated both major parties and believed that generals should be free from political interference. I haven't got anything too frank about the value of the campaigns but perhaps there might be something in the comments on the official histories. What the record shows is that he allowed the fighting at Aitape and on Bougainville to ramp up and then protected it from being cut. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 08:33, 28 November 2009 (UTC)
::I just added a bit from Peter Charlton's book about Sturdee being concerned about Blamey's instructions, but he doesn't have much more. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 10:11, 28 November 2009 (UTC)
:::He took it from Long, p. 26. Even so, there are a couple of things that come out of this exchange of instructions. Being a typical regular, Sturdee always wants clarification of his instructions. The historian then gets to see Blamey's brain in action, and we find him incisive and uncannily accurate. He's both cautious and aggressive, and in exactly the right places. But he keeps Sturdee on a tight rein; he doesn't delegate authority to launch offensives to Sturdee. 
:::At one point Sturdee asked for legal advice on whether he had to obey orders from the Prime Minister. The answer came back that no, orders come from the chain of command, which originates from the Governor General. Who can sack you on on the advice of the Prime Minister. Sturdee caved.

== Question regarding 2nd AIF ==
I was just wondering where the 2nd AIF should be sent when withdrawn from the Mediterranean? First it is said that their destination would be Java but in Wigmores conclusion the destination is Burma. --[[User:Bomzibar|Bomzibar]] ([[User talk:Bomzibar|talk]]) 06:48, 23 August 2013 (UTC)
:The original destination was Java. The advance party did arrive there. When it became clear that Java could not be held, the British chiefs suggested that the AIF be diverted to Burma (it being in the Indian Ocean at the time). There was an argument between the British and Australian Prime Ministers over this. In the end, the Australians won (although much of the 6th Division was diverted to Sri Lanka). Subsequent events vindicated Sturdee's judgement.

Another thing from the Island Campaigns section: For me it reads as if Blamey wanted to get rid of Sturdee and sent him to Washington for this reason, using the rest only as a justification. In my eyes this becomes only clearer as Sturdee accepted this only with the promise of a new command after one year. Is there any literature handling this case from authors outside the Australian military complex? --[[User:Bomzibar|Bomzibar]] ([[User talk:Bomzibar|talk]]) 07:06, 23 August 2013 (UTC)
:No, of course not. Who else would be interested? There's a huge volume of anti-Blamey literature. He did get rid of people on flimsy pretexts. Lavarack's supporters have a lot to say about his appointment to Washington in 1944. In Sturdee's case, though, this has to be balanced against the fact that he was in Washington for exactly one year, and Blamey kept his promise and appointed him to a senior field command. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 11:30, 23 August 2013 (UTC)
::Thank you for your quick response, Im still thinking if I should try to get the German translation awarded after a review. Furthermore, when exactly did Blamey decide to send Sturdee to Washington and when did he go there? I wonder because he did not return before Beginning of 1944 but the actual time of the sentences in which Blameys decision is covered can be regarded as still being 1942. So at first I thought he remained longer than one year in Washington. --[[User:Bomzibar|Bomzibar]] ([[User talk:Bomzibar|talk]]) 15:33, 23 August 2013 (UTC)
:::He was head of the Military Mission to Washington from 10 September 1942 to 29 February 1944, so that is a little over year, but part of that would have been travelling time. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 22:01, 23 August 2013 (UTC)

== Copyediting question ==
