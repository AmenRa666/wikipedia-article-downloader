'''William Franklin Raynolds''' (March 17, 1820 – October 18, 1894) was an explorer, engineer and U.S. army officer who served in the [[Mexican-American War]] and [[American Civil War]]. He is best known for leading the 1859–60  [[Raynolds Expedition]] while serving as a member of the U.S. Army [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]].

During the 1850s and again after his participation in the American Civil War, Raynolds was the head engineer on numerous lighthouse construction projects. He oversaw riverway and harbor dredging projects intended to improve accessibility and navigation for shipping. As a cartographer, Raynolds surveyed and mapped the islands and shorelines on the Great Lakes and other regions. At least six lighthouses whose construction he oversaw are still standing. Some are still in use and of these, several are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In 1848, during the American occupation of Mexico after the Mexican-American War, Raynolds and other U.S. Army personnel were the first confirmed to have reached the summit [[Pico de Orizaba]], the tallest mountain in Mexico, and inadvertently set what may have been a 50-year American alpine altitude record. In 1859, Raynolds was placed in charge of the first government-sponsored expedition to venture into the upper [[Yellowstone River|Yellowstone]] region that was later to become [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Heavy winter snowpack in the [[Absaroka Range]] of [[Wyoming]] prevented the expedition from reaching the Yellowstone Plateau, forcing them to divert to the south and cross [[Union Pass]] at the northern end of the [[Wind River Range]]. After negotiating the pass the expedition entered [[Jackson Hole]] and surveyed the [[Teton Range]], now within [[Grand Teton National Park]].

During the American Civil War, Raynolds participated in the [[Battle of Cross Keys]] during the [[Valley Campaign]] of 1862 and a year later was in charge of fortifications in the defense of the military arsenal at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]]. On March 13, 1865 Raynolds was [[Brevet (military)|brevetted]] [[brigadier general]] for meritorious service during the Civil War. Raynolds retired from the Corps of Engineers on March 17, 1884 with the permanent rank of [[colonel]] after a 40-year military career.

==Early life==
William Franklin Raynolds was born on March 17, 1820 in [[Canton, Ohio]], the fourth of six children to William Raynolds (November 2, 1789 – September 20, 1829) and Elizabeth Seabury (née Fisk 1796 – April 13, 1853).&lt;ref name=appleton&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events|publisher=D.

Raynolds's grandfather was also named William Raynolds (1764–1814) and had been a veteran of the [[War of 1812]], serving as a [[Company (military unit)|company]] [[Captain (United States)|captain]] from April 12, 1812 until April 13, 1813. During the War of 1812, the grandfather Raynolds rose to the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] while serving under [[Lewis Cass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=William Henry Perrin|title=History of Stark County: With an Outline Sketch of Ohio|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-yFEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA629|publisher=Baskin &amp; Battey|pages=628–629|date=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William F. Raynolds entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], on July 1, 1839 after being appointed{{efn|Before the American Civil War (1860–65), appointments to the United States Military Academy usually occurred after a nominee petitioned his U.S. Representative in Congress. If the Representative believed that the nominee was up to the task, deserving of the opportunity and of the right character, the nominee would then be appointed to attend the academy. U.S. Representatives could only make one appointment per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=James L.|title=The Best School: West Point, 1833–1866|date=July 1998|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=978-0-87338-612-8|pages=62–63|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dsVvbYlKFmgC&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=USMA%20appointees%20in%201839&amp;pg=PA63#v=snippet&amp;q=appointment&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} from Ohio.&lt;ref name=reunion&gt;{{cite journal|title=Twenty-First Annual Reunion of the Association Graduates of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York,  June 12, 1890|journal=The Association of the Graduates of the United States Military Academy|year=1890|pages=43–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVAuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA41|publisher=Evening News Printing and Binding House}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cullum1171&gt;{{cite book|last=Cullum|first=George W.|title=Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.: Nos. 1001–2000|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=978-1-248-90378-0|pages=154–156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doneAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA155|author2=Edward S.

Grant]].&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt; Raynolds married at a young age; he and his wife had no children.&lt;ref name=reunion/&gt;

==Military career==
Initially appointed a brevet [[second lieutenant]] in the 5th U.S. Infantry, within a few weeks Raynolds was transferred to the U.S. Army [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]].&lt;ref name=corp1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beginnings to 1815|work=The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: A Brief History|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|url=http://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/BriefHistoryoftheCorps/Beginnings.aspx|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Topographical Engineers performed surveys and developed maps for army use until their merger with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] in 1863.&lt;ref name=topo1&gt;{{cite web|title=Roster of the Corps of Topographical Engineers|publisher=U S Corps of Topographical Engineers|url=http://www.topogs.org/MWofficr.html|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raynolds's first assignments from 1843 to 1844 were as an assistant topographical engineer involved in improving navigation on the [[Ohio River]] and surveying the northeastern boundary of the U.S. between 1844 and 1847.&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt;

===Mexican-American War===
[[File:Pico from Fortin 2 enhanced2.jpg|thumb|right|Pico de Orizaba was believed by Raynolds to be the tallest mountain in North America.]]
When war with Mexico seemed imminent, topographic engineers were sent to the border to assist with the army's preparations. Raynolds served in [[Winfield Scott]]'s [[Mexican-American War]] campaign which marched overland to [[Mexico City]] from the Gulf of Mexico seaport at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]]. After the war, the American army occupied Mexico City and the surrounding region. During the occupation, Raynolds and others set out to map and explore nearby mountains. Raynolds's party is credited with being the first confirmed to climb to the summit of [[Pico de Orizaba]] ({{coord|19|01|48|N|97|16|12|W}}) which at {{convert|18620|ft}} is the tallest mountain in Mexico and third tallest in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pico de Orizaba, Mexico|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=49462|website=NASA Earth Observatory|publisher=NASA|accessdate=August 30, 2014|date=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Sidney E.|title=Glaciers of North America—GLACIERS OF MÉXICO|work=U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1386-J|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386j/mexico/mexico-lores.pdf|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=January 3, 2015|page=J384|format=pdf|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a period of several months, Raynolds and other officers from both the army and navy mapped the best approach route to Pico de Orizaba. To assist them in their climb, the party planned on taking [[Grappling hook|grapnels]] attached to long ropes and primitive [[crampon]]s in the form of shoes with projecting points to help ensure they could safely climb up cliffs and across glaciers.&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jerry|date=April 2002|title=Winfield Scott's Army of Occupation as Pioneer Alpinists: Epic Ascents of Popocatepetl and Citlaltepetl|journal=The Southwestern Historical Quarterly|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|volume=105|issue=4|pages=574–580|jstor=30239309|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Told by local villagers that any attempt to reach the summit would be fruitless because no one had ever done it before,{{efn|In 1838, French-Belgian botanist [[Henri Guillaume Galeotti]] may have climbed as high as the mountain crater but he made no claim to have reached the summit. Neither the Mexicans or the Americans were aware of Galeotti's earlier visit.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;}} the Americans became even more determined to show the Mexicans it could be climbed.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;

As the expedition left to ascend the mountain, a long pack train of nearly fifty officers, soldiers and native guides departed from the town of Orizaba in early May 1848. After several days of hiking through dense jungle, the expedition slowly gained altitude and established a base camp at {{convert|12000|ft|abbr=on}}. Starting from base camp in the early morning of May 10 nearly two dozen climbers made the final push to the top of the mountain, but only Raynolds and a few others reached the summit.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt; According to mountaineer and author Leigh N. Ortenburger, this feat may have inadvertently set the American [[mountaineering]] altitude record for the next 50&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=ortenburger&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortenburger|first=Leigh N.|title=A Climber's Guide to the Teton Range|year=1996|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|isbn=978-0-89886-480-9|page=374|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z-Y1tLw_YWgC&amp;pg=PA374|author2=Reynold G. Jackson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raynolds estimated the summit of Pico de Orizaba to be {{convert|17907|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, which was slightly greater than previous estimates but below the modern known altitude. As no higher peaks were known in North America at that time, Raynolds believed Pico de Orizaba was the tallest mountain on the continent.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt; The summit crater was covered in snow but estimated to be between {{convert|400|to|650|yds}} in diameter and {{convert|300|ft|abbr=on}} deep. The American achievement was disputed by the Mexicans until an 1851 French expedition discovered an American flag on the summit with the year 1848 carved in the flagpole.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;

===Lighthouse engineer===
After returning from Mexico, Raynolds resumed mapping the U.S.–Canada border which he had been surveying before the war, then embarked on a project to develop water resources for the nation's growing capital of [[Washington, D.C.]] Raynolds traveled the [[Great Lakes]] for several years surveying and mapping shorelines while identifying potential [[lighthouse]] locations.&lt;ref name=beers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beers|first1=Henry P.|title=A History of the U.S. Topographical Engineers, 1813–1863|journal=The Military Engineer|year=1942|volume=34|issue=200–201|pages=(Jun 1942): pp. 287–91 &amp; (Jul 1942): pp. 348–52|url=http://www.topogs.org/History.htm|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After promotion to [[First Lieutenant|first lieutenant]] and then captain, in 1857 he was assigned to design and supervise the construction of lighthouses along the [[Jersey Shore]] and the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] regions.&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt; in the late 1850s Raynolds supervised construction of the [[Fenwick Island Light]] in [[Delaware]] and the [[Cape May Light]] in New Jersey.&lt;ref name=house&gt;{{cite journal|author1=United States House of Representatives|title=House Documents|date=1860|volume=123 and 126|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6VNUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA183|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, he made alterations to the [[Jupiter Inlet Light]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]].&lt;ref name=jupiter&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Light Station Information Florida|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/weblighthouses/LHFL.asp|publisher=U.S. Coast Guard|accessdate=January 4, 2015|date=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1859, Raynolds was charged with leading an expedition into the [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] region of [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]] to determine, &quot;as far as practicable, everything relating to&amp;nbsp;... the Indians of the country, its agricultural and mineralogical resources&amp;nbsp;... the navigability of its streams, its topographical features, and the facilities or obstacles which the latter present to the construction of rail or common roads&amp;nbsp;...&quot;.&lt;ref name=baldwin&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Kenneth H.|title=Enchanted Enclosure:The Army Engineers and Yellowstone National Park|year=2005|publisher=University Press of the Pacific|isbn=978-1-4102-2180-3|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/baldwin/chap2.htm|accessdate=July 13, 2014|chapter=II— TERRA INCOGNITA: The Raynolds Expedition of 1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was carried out by a handful of technicians, including photographer and topographer [[James D.

Maynadier. The expedition was supported by a small infantry detachment of 30 and was federally funded with $60,000. Experienced [[mountain man]] [[Jim Bridger]] was hired to guide the expedition.&lt;ref name=baldwin/&gt;

The expedition started in late May 1859 at [[St. Louis, Missouri]], then was transported by two steamboats up the [[Missouri River]] to [[New Fort Pierre]], [[South Dakota]].&lt;ref name=bighorn&gt;{{cite web|title=Raynolds Expedition 1859–60 and Bighorn Canyon Part 1|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/bica/historyculture/raynolds-expedition-1859-60-and-bighorn-canyon-part-1.htm|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June the expedition left New Fort Pierre and headed overland to [[Fort Sarpy]] where they encountered the [[Crow Nation|Crow Indians]]. Raynolds stated that the Crow were a &quot;small band compared to their neighbors, but are famous warriors, and, according to common report, seldom fail to hold their own with any of the tribes unless greatly outnumbered.&quot;&lt;ref name=raynolds50-51&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raynolds|first1=William F.|title=Report on the Exploration of the Yellowstone River|date=October 1, 2008|publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC|isbn=978-1-4370-6624-1|pages=50–51|url=https://books.google.com/?id=guIRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raynolds was impressed with the Crow chief Red Bear, and after assuring him that the expedition meant only to pass through Crow Indian territory and not linger, traded with the Crows for seven horses.&lt;ref name=raynolds50-51 /&gt;

Raynolds divided his expedition, sending a smaller detachment under Maynadier to explore the [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]], a major tributary of the [[Yellowstone River]].  Two of Maynadier's party, James D. Hutton and Zephyr Recontre, the expedition's [[Siouan languages|Sioux]] interpreter, took a side trip to locate and investigate an isolated rock formation that had been seen from great distance by a previous expedition in 1857. Hutton was the first person of European descent to reach this rock formation in northeastern Wyoming, later known as [[Devils Tower]]; Raynolds never elaborated on this event, mentioning it only in passing.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name=tower&gt;{{cite web|last=Mattison|first=Ray H.|title=The First Fifty Years – Early Exploration|work=History and Culture|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/deto/historyculture/early-exploration.htm|accessdate=June 15, 2014|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2, 1859, Raynolds's detachment had followed the Yellowstone River to the confluence with the [[Bighorn River]] in south-central Montana.&lt;ref name=bighorn/&gt; The two parties under Raynolds and Maynadier reunited on October 12, 1859 and wintered at Deer Creek Station, on the [[Platte River]] in central Wyoming.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name=smithsonian&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TzdAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA589|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|page=589|date=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition recommenced its explorations in May 1860. Raynolds led a party north and west up the upstream portion of the Bighorn River, which is today called the [[Wind River (Wyoming)|Wind River]], hoping to cross the mountains at [[Togwotee Pass]] in the [[Absaroka Range]], a [[mountain pass]] known to expedition guide Jim Bridger. Meanwhile, Maynadier led his party back north to the Bighorn River to explore it and its associated tributary streams more thoroughly. The plan was for the two parties to reunite on June 30, 1860 at [[Three Forks, Montana]], so they could make observations of a total [[solar eclipse]] forecast for July 18, 1860.&lt;ref name=baldwin/&gt;&lt;ref name=journal/&gt; Hampered by towering basaltic cliffs and deep snows, Raynolds attempted for over a week to reconnoiter to the top of Togwotee Pass, but was forced south due to the June 30 deadline for reaching Three Forks. Bridger then led the party south over another pass in the northern [[Wind River Range]] that Raynolds named [[Union Pass]], to the west of which lay [[Jackson Hole]] and the [[Teton Range]]. From there the expedition went southwest, crossing the southern Teton Range at [[Teton Pass]] and entering [[Pierre's Hole]] in present-day [[Idaho]].&lt;ref name=journal/&gt; Though Raynolds and his party managed to get to Three Forks by the scheduled date, Maynadier's party was several days late, which prevented a detachment heading north to observe the solar eclipse.&lt;ref name=baldwin/&gt; The reunited expedition then headed home, traveling from [[Fort Benton, Montana]], to [[Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site|Fort Union]] near the Montana-North Dakota border via steamboat. It then journeyed overland to [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where the expedition members were disbanded in October 1860.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt;

Though the Raynolds Expedition was unsuccessful in exploring the region that later became Yellowstone National Park, it was the first federally funded party to enter Jackson Hole and observe the Teton Range.&lt;ref name=chittenden&gt;{{cite book|last=Chittenden|first=Hiram M.|title=The Yellowstone National Park Historical and Descriptive|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC|isbn=978-1-4179-0456-3|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yYCaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=The+Yellowstone+National+Park+Historical+And+Descriptive+Raynolds|chapter=Chapter VII.

Much of the artwork created by Hutton and especially Schönborn was lost, though several of Schönborn's [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]]s appeared in Ferdinand V. Hayden's 1883 report that was submitted after later expeditions.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;

===American Civil War===
Raynolds returned to Washington at the outbreak of the war, and was made chief topographic engineer of the [[Department of Virginia and North Carolina#Department of Virginia|Department of Virginia]] in July 1861. The army lacked adequate maps for military use, so Raynolds and his team of engineers began to survey and draw up maps of [[Virginia]] and the region of the western portion of that state that had remained loyal to the Union and would become the new state of  [[West Virginia]]. In 1862, Raynolds was engaged with [[John C. Frémont|John C. Frémont's]] Mountain Department in chasing [[Stonewall Jackson]] up the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and participated in the [[Battle of Cross Keys]].&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt;

Raynolds spent two months recovering from illness after the [[Valley Campaign]], then was assigned as chief engineer of Middle Department and [[VIII Corps (Union Army)|VIII Corps]] in January 1863. Promoted to major in the Corps of Engineers, he found himself in charge of the defenses of vital [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]] in March 1863 during [[Robert E. Lee|Robert E. Lee's]] second [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] invasion of the north during the [[Gettysburg Campaign]].&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt; On March 31, 1863, the Corps of Topographical Engineers ceased to be an independent branch of the army and was merged into the Corps of Engineers and Raynolds served in that branch of the army for the remainder of his career. Officers from the two corps maintained their ranks based on the time at which they received their promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reunification of the Corps of Engineers and the Corps of Topographical Engineers|url=http://www.topogs.org/GO79.html|publisher=U.S. Corp of Topographical Engineers|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the end of war approached and hostilities with the [[Sioux Indians]] loomed, Raynolds's knowledge of and experiences in the Great Lakes region became more important to the army than his command of the fortifications of Harpers Ferry. As a result, he returned to the Great Lakes as superintending engineer of surveys and lighthouses in April 1864, and saw no further combat for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt; Before the war was over, on March 13, 1865 Raynolds was brevetted to [[Brigadier General|brigadier general]] for meritorious service.&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt;

===Postwar career===
[[File:Capemay2.jpg|thumb|right|The construction of the Cape May Lighthouse was overseen by Raynolds in 1859 and the lighthouse is still in use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.]]
After the Civil War, the Corps of Engineers undertook a program of river and harbor improvements. Raynolds supervised the dredging and improvement of navigation on the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and Missouri Rivers. He also helped supervise several harbor dredging and construction projects, involving the harbor in [[Buffalo, New York]], the Harbor of Refuge in [[New Buffalo, Michigan]], [[Erie Harbor]] in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], and the river harbors of St. Louis, Missouri and [[Alton, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt; Raynolds sited and oversaw the installation of dozens of lighthouses in the Great Lakes area, where he served as the superintending engineer from 1864 to 1870.&lt;ref name=cullums2&gt;{{cite book|last=Cullum|first=George W.|title=Biographical Register of the Officers|publisher=Applewood Books|isbn=978-1-4290-2129-6|pages=158–159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Plg1epvs3aUC&amp;pg=PA158|date=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raynolds was promoted to permanent rank of [[Lieutenant Colonel|lieutenant colonel]] in the Corps of Engineers on March 7, 1867.&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt; He then supervised lighthouse construction along the [[Gulf Coast]] and in New Jersey where he managed the construction of the [[Hereford Inlet Light]]house in 1874.&lt;ref name=veasey1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Veasey|first1=David|title=Guarding New Jersey's Shore: Lighthouses and Life-Saving Stations|date=May 28, 2000|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-0417-9|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fU9hwG2GuC4C&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt; From May 5 to October 7, 1877, Reynolds led a procession of American engineers to an engineering conference in Europe.&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt;

Promoted to the permanent rank of colonel on January 2, 1881, Raynolds continued serving with the Corps of Engineers supporting a variety of harbor and river navigational improvements until his retirement in 1884, after a military career that spanned 40&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=cullum1171/&gt; As he approached retirement, Raynolds was elected a trustee of the [[Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref name=presbyterian&gt;{{cite web|title=Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.

==Legacy==

Raynolds's 1848 expedition to the summit of Pico de Orizaba in Mexico predated what is known as the [[Golden age of alpinism]] (1854–65), when many major mountain peaks in the [[Alps]] were first climbed. The effort to summit the mountain was one of the earliest deliberate attempts to climb a major mountain peak, and involved logistics, planning and use of rudimentary climbing equipment, &quot;making it one of the more serious mountaineering expeditions undertaken to that point in history.&quot;&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt; Though unable to penetrate into the heart of what later became Yellowstone National Park, the Raynolds Expedition produced maps that were used by subsequent explorers to the greater Yellowstone region.&lt;ref name=baldwin/&gt; Raynolds also located suitable wagon routes in the [[Bighorn Basin]] and was able to help narrow down the most appropriate routes for a future transcontinental railroad. The Raynolds Expedition further determined that few if any rivers in the region would be suitable for steamboats due to numerous rapids and steep gradients.&lt;ref name=raynolds&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raynolds|first1=William Franklin|title=Report on the Exploration of the Yellowstone River|date=1868|publisher=U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Government Printing Office|isbn=978-1-4370-6624-1|pages=12–18|url=https://books.google.com/?id=guIRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several lighthouses whose construction was designed or supervised by Raynolds are still in use and several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape May County|url=http://www.state.nj.us/dep/hpo/1identify/nrsr_lists/cape_may.pdf|website=New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places|publisher=State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|accessdate=January 4, 2014|format=pdf|date=October 22, 2014|quote=List includes New Hereford and Cape May lighthouses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two geographical locations are named for William Raynolds. The mountain gap where the Raynolds Expedition crossed the [[Continental Divide]] between southwest Montana and northeast Idaho is named [[Raynolds Pass]] ({{coord|44|42|40|N|111|28|11|W}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gnis|id=789424|name=Raynolds Pass|accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Works Projects Administration|title=The WPA Guide to 1930s Montana|date=August 1, 1994|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0-8165-1503-5|page=356|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NS_lCWQFJLYC&amp;pg=PA356&amp;dq=Raynolds+Pass}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Raynolds Peak]] ({{coord|43|52|15|N|110|49|30|W}}) is an isolated peak in the Teton Range that was named after him in 1938.&lt;ref name=ortenburger/&gt;&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gnis|id=1602413|name=Raynolds Peak |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossil remains of the extinct [[Gastropoda|gastropod]] ''[[Viviparus|Viviparus raynoldsanus]]'' was named by Ferdinand V.
