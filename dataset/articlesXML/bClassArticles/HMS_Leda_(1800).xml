'''HMS ''Leda''''', launched in 1800, was the lead ship of a successful [[Leda-class frigate|class]] of forty-seven British [[Royal Navy]] 38-gun sailing [[frigate]]s.  ''Leda''{{'}}s design was based on the [[France|French]] {{ship|French frigate|Hébé|1782|2}}, which the British had captured in 1782. (''Hébé'' herself was the name vessel for the French {{sclass-|Hébé|frigate|1}}s. ''Hébé'', therefore, has the rare distinction of being the model for both a French and a British frigate class.) ''Leda'' was wrecked at the mouth of [[Milford Haven]] in 1808, Capt Honeyman was exonerated of all blame, as it was a pilot error.

==Service history==
===French Revolutionary Wars===

Captain [[George Johnstone Hope]] commissioned ''Leda'' in November 1800. In 1801 he sailed her in the [[English Channel]] and to the coast of [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

On 12 March 1801, ''Leda'' recaptured ''Bolton'',&lt;ref name=LG15362/&gt; Captain Watson, a 20-gun [[letter of marque]] that had sailed from [[Demerara]] to [[Liverpool]] some 6 weeks previously in company with ''Union'' and ''Dart''. These two vessels were also letters of marque, all carrying valuable cargoes of sugar, coffee, indigo and cotton. During the voyage ''Union'' started to take on water so her crew transferred to ''Bolton''. Then ''Bolton'' and ''Dart'' parted company in a gale. Next, ''Bolton'' had the misfortune to meet the French [[privateer]] ''Gironde'', which was armed with 26 guns and had a crew of 260 men. ''Gironde'' captured ''Bolton'' in an hour-long fight that killed two passengers and wounded Watson and five men. Although ''Gironde'' was damaged, she had suffered no casualties.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 5, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bolton'' was also carrying ivory, a tiger, and a large collection of birds, monkeys, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1897), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then on 5 April ''Leda'' captured the French ship ''Desiree'', of eight men and 70 tons. She was sailing from [[Bordeaux]] to Brell with a cargo of wheat.&lt;ref name=LG15362/&gt; Four days later ''Leda'' recaptured the Portuguese ship ''Cæsar'', of 10 men and 100 tons. ''Cæsar'' had been sailing from [[Bristol]] to [[Lisbon]] with a cargo of sundries when the French privateer ''Laura'' had captured her.&lt;ref name=LG15362/&gt;  

Lastly, on 1 May, ''Leda'' captured the French privateer ''Jupiter''. ''Jupiter'', of 90 tons, was armed with 16 guns and had a crew of 60 men. She was from [[Morlaix]] on cruise.&lt;ref name=LG15362&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=498|issue=15362|date=5 May 1801}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day ''Leda'' recaptured the Portuguese vessel ''Tejo''. Then on 2 September ''Leda'' captured ''Venturose''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=822|issue=15503|date=3 August 1802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because ''Leda'' served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp &quot;Egypt&quot; to the Naval General Service Medal that the [[Admiralty]] issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants.

In September 1802 ''Leda'' came under the command of Captain John (or James) Hardy.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==Napoleonic Wars==
Captain [[Robert Honyman (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Honyman]] (or Honeyman) recommissioned ''Leda'' in August 1803 for the North Sea. he would remain her captain until her loss in 1808. Still, at various times ''Leda'' was under the temporary command of Captain [[Henry Digby (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Digby]] in 1804 and Captain John Hartley in February 1805.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

In 1803 ''Leda'' was in the Channel. When the war with France recommenced, Honeyman was put in charge of a small squadron of [[gun-brig]]s off Boulogne. On 18 May ''Leda'' and {{HMS|Amelia|1796|2}} detained the Dutch ship ''Phoenix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1237|issue=15847|date=28 September 1805}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day ''Leda'' captured ''Bodes Lust''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=620|issue=16027|date=9 May 1807}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|A petty officer's share of the prize money for ''Bodes Luft'' was [[£sd|£]]17 15[[shilling|s]] 6[[pence|d]]; an able seaman's share was £6 0s 6d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=678|issue=16030|date=19 May 1807}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} 

Five days after that, ''Leda'', ''Amelia'', {{HMS|Raisonable|1768|2}} and {{HMS|Gelikheid|1797|2}} were in company at the capture of the Dutch ship ''Twee Vrienden''.{{refn|A petty officer's share of the prize money was £4 3s 10d; an able seaman's share was 13s 7d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1322|issue=15854|date=1 October 1805}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1807 there was a further distribution of prize money for ''Twee Vrinden'' and a distribution for ''Phoenix''. A petty officer's share of the prize money for ''Phoenix'' was £18 17s 0d; an able seaman's share was £5 7s 6d. For ''Twee Vrinden'' the amounts were £4 3s 6d and 13s 6d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=621|issue=16027|date=9 May 1807}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

On 29 September Honyman and his squadron attacked a division of 26 enemy gun boats. The engagement lasted several hours until the gunboats took refuge off the pier in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]. Honyman wanted to have his [[bomb vessel]]s engage them, but winds and tide were unfavorable. The next day 25 more French gunboats arrived. However, before they could join the division that had arrived the night before, the British were able to drive two on shore where they were wrecked. The British suffered no casualties or material damage though a shell did explode in ''Leda{{'}}''s hold. Fortunately, this did little damage and caused no casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1323|endpage=1324|issue=15624|date=27 September 1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October Honyman sighted a convoy of six French sloops, some armed, under the escort of a gun-brig. He sent {{HMS|Harpy|1796|2}} and {{HMS|Lark|1794|2}} to pursue them but the winds were uncooperative and the squadron was unable to engage. Instead, the [[Hired armed vessels|hired armed]] [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]] {{ship|Hired armed cutter|Admiral Mitchell||2}}, which had only 35 men and twelve 12-pounder carronades, came up and attacked the convoy. After two and a half hours of cannonading, ''Admiral Mitchell'' succeeded in driving one sloop and the brig, which was armed with twelve 32-pounder guns, on the rocks. ''Admiral Mitchell'' had one gun dismounted, suffered damage to her mast and rigging, and had five men wounded, two seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1533|endpage=1534|issue=15640|date=5 November 1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of July 1804, a boarding party under Lieutenant M'Lean took ''Leda''{{'}}s boats to mount an unsuccessful attack on a French gunvessel in Boulogne Roads. The attackers succeeded in capturing their target, but the strong tide prevented them from retrieving her. Casualties were heavy in the cutting out party and M'Lean was among the dead; in all, only 14 out of the 38 men in the boarding party returned to ''Leda''.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early in the morning of 24 April 1805, ''Leda'', again under Honyman's command after Hartley's temporary command, sighted twenty-six French vessels rounding [[Cap Gris Nez]]. Honyman immediately ordered {{HMS|Fury|1790|2}}, ''Harpy'', {{HMS| Railleur|1804|2}}, {{HMS|Bruiser|1804|2}}, {{HMS|Gallant|1804|2}}, {{HMS|Archer|1801|2}}, {{HMS| Locust|1801|2}}, {{HMS|Tickler|1804|2}}, {{HMS|Watchful|1804|2}}, {{HMS|Monkey|1801|2}}, {{HMS| Firm|1804|2}} and {{HMS|Starling|1805|2}} to intercept. After a fight of about two hours, ''Starling'' and ''Locust'' had captured seven armed schuyts in an action within pistol-shot of the shore batteries on Cap Gris Nez.&lt;ref name=LG15800&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=553|endpage=554|issue=15800|date=23 April 1805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;A schuyt was a Dutch flat-bottomed sailboat, broad in the beam, with square stern; usually equipped with leeboards to serve for a keel.&lt;/ref&gt; The schuyts were all of 25 to 28 tons burthen, and carried in all 117 soldiers and 43 seamen under the command of officers from the 51st. Infantry Regiment. The French convoy had been bound for [[Ambleteuse]] from Dunkirk. On the British side the only casualty was one man wounded on ''Archer''. The seven schyuts were:&lt;ref name=LG15800/&gt;
*Schuyt No. 52, under the command of a Sub-Lieutenant of Infantry Loriol, armed with three 24-pounders;
*Schuyt No. 48, under the command of A. Joron of the 51st the Infantry, armed with two 6-pounders, one 24-pounder and one brass howitzer;
*Schuyt No. 57, under the command of Lieutenant Loriol of 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounders;
*Schuyt No. 45 under the command of Sub-Lieutenant Litner of the 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder, one 12-pounder and one 6-pounder;
*Schuyt No. 3. under the command of Mr. Calder, the senior commander, who left her before the British took possession of her; 
*Schuyt No. 54, under the command of Sub-Lieutenant Bragur of the 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounders;
*Schuyt No.43, Sub Lieutenant Billa of the 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounders.

The next day ''Archer'' brought in two more schuyts, No.s 44 and 58, each armed with one 24-pounder and two 12-pounders.&lt;ref name=LG15800/&gt;  On 25 April 1805 ''Railleur'' towed eight of the French schuyts into the Downs. ''Starling'', which had received a great deal of damage, followed ''Railleur'' in.

In early 1806 ''Leda'' was with Sir [[Home Popham]]'s squadron at the reduction of the [[Cape of Good Hope]], where she supported the landing of the troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=253|endpage=259|issue=15893|date=28 February 1806}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shared in the capture of the ''Rolla'' on 21 February. On 4 March she was at [[Table Bay]] and in sight when {{HMS|Diadem|1782|2}} captured the French frigate {{ship|French frigate|Volontaire|1796|2}} and the two transports that ''Volontaire'' was escorting, which turned out to be two British transports that the frigate had captured in the [[Bay of Biscay]], together with the British troops on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=601|endpage=602|issue=15919|date=13 May 1806}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 March the squadron captured the ''General Izidro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1809|issue=16424|date=13 November 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1810 the prize money for the capture of the Cape of Good Hope was payable.{{refn|A naval captain's share, i.e., the share for Captain Honyman, was £238 8s 5¾d; for a seaman the proceeds were £1 13s 10d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=947|issue=16382|date=26 June 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Then in July 1810 there was further distribution of money for the capture of ''Volontaire'' and ''Rolla''.{{refn|A petty officer's share of the prize money for ''Volontaire'' was £6 5s 0½d; an able seaman's share was £1 11s 6d. For ''Rolla'' the amounts were 15s 0½d and 3s 10d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1047|issue=16387|date=14 July 18071}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} In December 1810 prize money for ''General Izidro'' was payable.{{refn|A first-class share, that of a naval captain, was £255 16s 10½d; a fifth-class share, that of a seaman, was worth 15s 9¼d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=2065|issue=16438|date=25 December 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

''Leda'' then accompanied Home Popham across the Atlantic for his expedition to the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]]. On 9 September 1806 ''Leda'' pursued a [[brigantine]] on her way to [[Montevideo]] until the brigantine's crew beached her. ''Leda'' then sent her boats to retrieve or destroy the brigantine. However, when the boarding party reached the brigantine they discovered that her crew had already abandoned her. They also found that she was unarmed, though pierced for 14 guns. Because of the heavy seas the boarding party could not retrieve the brigantine, or even burn her. Instead they simply set her adrift among the breakers. During the operation small arms fire from the shore wounded four men.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=125|endpage=126|issue=15996|date=31 January 1807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Leda'' remained in South America until the final British evacuation in about September 1807. On 22 August she was in sight, together with a number of other warships, when {{HMS|Procris|1806|2}} captured ''Minerva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1844|issue=16523|date=17 September 1811}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leda'' then returned to [[Sheerness]] and served in the Channel. 

At eight o'clock on the morning of 4 December, some {{convert|4|league|lk=in}} off Cap de Caux, ''Leda'' sighted a privateer [[lugger]] making for the French coast, as well as a brig that appeared to be her prize. The brig ran for Havre de Grace but the lugger sailed in another direction as ''Leda'' pursued her. After six hours ''Leda'' succeeded in capturing the lugger, which turned out to be the brand new vessel ''Adolphe'', under the command of Nicholas Famenter. ''Adolphe'' was armed with ten 18-pound carronades, four 4-pounder guns, two 2-pounder guns and two [[swivel gun]]s. She was eight days out of Boulogne. She had only 25 men on board as she had already put another 45 men of her crew on prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1671|issue=16095|date=17 September 1808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss==

On 31 January 1808, ''Leda'' was caught in a gale that did much damage to the ship. Honeyman decided to try to take refuge at Milford Haven but she was wrecked at the mouth of the harbour. The quarantine master for the port came aboard ''Leda'' to urge her abandonment. The entire crew was able to get off safely.&lt;ref name=Hepper&gt;Hepper (1994), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

A court martial held on board the [[Spanish ship Salvador del Mundo|HMS ''Salvador del Mundo'']] in the [[Hamoaze]] acquitted Honeyman and his crew of all blame. It found that the pilot, James Garretty, had laid a wrong course after mistaking Thorn Island for the Stack Rocks, a mistake that was due to the bad weather and poor visibility.&lt;ref name=Hepper/&gt;
