'''SS ''San Wilfrido''''' was a {{GRT|6458|link=off}} steam-powered British [[tank ship|tanker]] which was built in 1914 by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co Ltd]], in the Low Walker yard. The ship was operated by [[Eagle Oil and Shipping Company#Eagle Oil Transport Company|Eagle Oil Transport Co Ltd]]. ''San Wilfrido'' was sunk by a German [[naval mine|mine]] on 3 August 1914—one day before Britain formally entered the [[World War I|First World War]]. It was Britain's first naval loss of the war.

== Description ==
The ship was built by Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co Ltd, Low Walker, as yard number 856. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 11{{nbsp}}February 1914 and completed in April 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;tynebuiltships&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tynebuiltships.co.uk/S-Ships/sanwilfrido1914.html|title= San Wilfrido 1914|website= TYNE BUILT SHIPS. A history of Tyne shipbuilders and the ships that they built|accessdate= 17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[sister ship]]s were {{SS|San Valerio}}, {{SS|San Urbano}} and {{SS|San Zeferino}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wrecksite&quot;/&gt;

She was {{convert|420|ft|3|in|m}} long, with a beam of {{convert|54|ft|7|in|m}} and a depth of {{convert|32|ft|6|in|m}}. She had a [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] of 6,458 and a [[Net Register Tonnage#Tonnage measurements|NRT]] of 3,928.&lt;ref name=tynebuiltships /&gt;

The ship was propelled by a quadruple expansion steam engine, which had cylinders of {{convert|24|in|m}}, {{convert|35|in|m}}, {{convert|50.5|in|m}} and {{convert|73|in|m}} diameter by {{convert|51|in|m}} stroke. The engine was built by [[Wallsend Slipway &amp; Engineering Company|Wallsend Slipway &amp; Engineering Co Ltd]], [[Wallsend]].&lt;ref name=tynebuiltships /&gt;

== History ==
After her commission, ''San Wilfrido'' made trips with usually 8000 [[tonne]]s of oil out of her tonnage of 9000.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;&gt;
{{cite news|date=8 August 1914|title=More Mines. London Steamer Destroyed|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ww1-archive/11019813/Daily-Telegraph-August-8-1914.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808154127/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ww1-archive/11019813/Daily-Telegraph-August-8-1914.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London |page=6 |archive-date= 8 August 2014| accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was sunk after just four months after her completion.

=== Sinking ===
On 3 August 1914 ''San Wilfrido'' was sailing from [[Hamburg]] to [[Portland, England|Portland]] in ballast with no cargo. The trip was expected to take two and a half days after which the ship would depart for [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=tynebuiltships /&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;

While navigating the [[Elbe]] about eight miles above [[Brunsbuttel]] she was given permission to proceed until [[Cuxhaven]] at the mouth of the North Sea. There was no [[pilot ship]] available to take her through the minefield at Cuxhaven so she attempted to proceed on her own along the usual channel. [[Tugboat]] men of the harbour tried to warn ''San Wilfrido'''s master about the danger by shouting. The master then tried to evade the mines by attempting to go full speed astern. However, at approximately four p.m.,&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;/&gt; a strong ebb tide carried ''San Wilfrido'' into the mines. Three explosions followed and crippled the ship making it the first British naval loss of the war. A German tug took the crew away and made them prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurd|first=Archibald|date=1921|title= HISTORY OF THE GREAT WAR&amp;nbsp;— THE MERCHANT NAVY, Volume 1, 1914 to Spring 1915 (Part 1 of 2)|url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW1Book-MN1a.htm|location=London|publisher=John Murray|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126162626/http://naval-history.net/WW1Book-MN1a.htm|archive-date=26 November 2013|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Consul-General]] in [[Antwerp]] was informed and he in turn notified the [[Admiralty]]. The information was passed on to [[Lloyd's of London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;/&gt; When the news of the ship's sinking arrived to Britain four days later, on 7 August, Britain was already at war with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fayne|first=Charles Ernest|date=1920|title= History of the Great War. Seaborne Trade. Vol 1.|url=https://archive.org/details/seabornetrade01fayluoft|location=London|publisher=John Murray|page=56|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 44-strong crew were men mostly from [[Tyneside|Tyne]], with three or four believed to be from [[London]]. The ship was captained by Captain C. H. Williams of [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;/&gt; The imprisoned crew had to survive on raw herring for two days until they were interned at [[Ruhleben internment camp|Ruhleben prisoner of war camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ruhleben.tripod.com/id6.html |title=Prisoners E&amp;nbsp;— F |last=Patton |first=Chris | date=29 January 2013|website=THE RUHLEBEN STORY |publisher=Scotland's Greatest Story|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426095530/http://ruhleben.tripod.com/id6.html|archive-date=26 April 2014 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Baxter, a [[wireless operator]] of ''San Wilfrido'' made a [[model ship|miniature model]] of the ship while interned and submitted it to the Ruhleben Exhibition at the [[Central Hall Westminster|Central Hall of Westminster]] after the war. The model is now in the collections of the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ruhleben.tripod.com/id4.html |title=Prisoners A&amp;nbsp;— B |last=Patton |first=Chris | date=29 January 2013|website=THE RUHLEBEN STORY |publisher=Scotland's Greatest Story|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020045244/http://ruhleben.tripod.com/id4.html|archive-date=20 October 2013 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wreck was removed from Cuxhaven in September 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyBritishBVLSMN1408.htm |title=World War 1 at Sea.

Eagle Oil and Shipping Company renamed a ship they had acquired in 1946 as {{SS|Empire Cobbett}} to ''San Wilfrido'' in honour of the original ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=45a1288.pdf
