'''HMS ''Nairana''''' ({{IPAc-en|n|aɪ|ˈ|r|ɑː|n|ə}}) was a passenger ferry that was requisitioned by the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) as a [[seaplane carrier]] in 1917. She was laid down in Scotland in 1914 as TSS ''Nairana'' for the Australian shipping line [[Huddart Parker]], but construction was suspended after the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Following resumption of work, the ship was launched in 1915, and converted to operate wheeled aircraft from her forward [[flight deck|flying-off deck]], as well as [[floatplane]]s that were lowered into the water. She saw service during the war with the [[Grand Fleet]], and in 1918–19 supported the British [[North Russia Intervention|intervention]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].

''Nairana'' was returned to her former owners in 1921 and refitted in her original planned configuration, and spent the next 27 years ferrying passengers and cargo between [[Tasmania]] and [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]]. She was twice struck by [[rogue wave]]s in [[Bass Strait]], and nearly [[Capsizing|capsized]] on both occasions. ''Nairana'' was the only Bass Strait ferry not requisitioned for military service in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and so became the sole passenger ship with service to Tasmania during the conflict. She was [[Ship decommissioning|laid up]] in 1948, wrecked in a storm three years later and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] ''in situ'' in 1953–54.

==Background and description==

===Original design===
In December 1913, negotiations between the Australian shipping line Huddart Parker and the British shipbuilders [[William Denny and Brothers]] began for a passenger ship with some cargo capacity to serve in the Australian coastal trade.&lt;ref name=Denny&gt;Lyon, pp. 679–680.&lt;/ref&gt; The shipping line wanted a vessel that would improve on their earlier ferry ''Loongana'', which had also been built by Denny's.&lt;ref name=Plowman53&gt;Plowman, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Huddart Parker decided on a design that could carry {{DWT|800|long|disp=long|link=}} of cargo on a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|14|ft|m|1}} and could maintain {{convert|19.5|kn|lk=in}} for 12 hours. The ship was ordered on 22 January 1914, at a cost of £129,830, for delivery in May 1915.&lt;ref name=Denny/&gt; She was named ''Nairana'' (an [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal Australian]] name for the &quot;[[golden eagle]]&quot; or &quot;eagle of the sun&quot;).&lt;ref name=Plowman53/&gt;

''Nairana'' was designed to accommodate 280 first-class and 112 second-class passengers, and had a crew of 26 officers, 42 crewmen and 25 [[stoker (occupation)|stokers]]. She had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|328|ft|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|45|ft|6|in|1}}, and a draught of {{convert|14|ft|7|in|1}}. Designed to [[displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|3479|LT|t}}&lt;ref name=l79&gt;Lyon, p. 679.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nairana'' had tonnages of {{GRT|3547|disp=long}},&lt;ref name=gg9&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; 1,118 long tons DWT, {{NRT|2014|disp=long|link=}} and 3,311 tons [[Builder's Old Measurement]].&lt;ref name=l79/&gt;

The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] 21 June 1915 at the Denny [[shipyard]] in [[Dumbarton]], Scotland. The launch had been delayed nine months, after the British Government ordered that all construction workers be pulled from non-military vessels after the start of World War I, and work had been resumed only to make her [[slipway]] available for warships. She remained at anchor for the next year and a half. The Royal Navy purchased her on 27 February 1917 for completion as a combined landplane and seaplane carrier.&lt;ref name=Plowman53&gt;Plowman, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The price of £138,118 included the cost of conversion to her new role. The ship was nearly complete when requisitioned, although her propelling machinery was not yet installed. Consequently, only limited internal modifications, notably the addition of three large workshops, could be made.&lt;ref name=Denny/&gt;

===Military configuration===
[[File:HMS Nairana during 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|alt=Black and white photograph of a ship. The vessel has two funnels, a large boxy superstructure topped by a crane, and an aircraft on her stern|HMS ''Nairana'' in 1918]]
HMS ''Nairana'' displaced {{convert|3070|LT|t}} in RN service. She was {{convert|352|ft|1}} long overall, had a beam of {{convert|45.6|ft|in|1}}, and a mean draught of {{convert|13|ft|2|in}}. The ship was powered by two sets of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[Steam turbine#Marine propulsion|steam turbines]] designed to produce a total of {{convert|6700|shp|lk=in}},&lt;ref name=l3&gt;Layman, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; each driving one three-bladed [[propeller]]. The turbines were powered by steam provided by six [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] [[water-tube boiler]]s at a working pressure of {{convert|202|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=l79/&gt; On her [[sea trial]]s, ''Nairana'' made {{convert|7003|shp|abbr=on}} and reached {{convert|20.32|kn}}.&lt;ref name=l3/&gt; She carried {{convert|448|LT|t}} of coal which gave her a range of {{convert|1060|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|19.5|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1988, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew numbered 278, including 90 aviation personnel.&lt;ref name=l3/&gt;

The ship was armed with four 40-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]], {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] 12 cwt&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;Cwt&quot; is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.&lt;/ref&gt; [[quick-firing gun]]s on single mounts. Two of these were mounted on the [[forecastle]] as low-angle guns, and the other two were mounted on the rear [[hangar]] roof as [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]].&lt;ref name=f1&gt;Friedman 1988, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; They fired {{convert|12.5|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2359|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; this gave a maximum range of {{convert|9720|yd|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2011, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nairana'' was fitted with a {{convert|95|ft|1|adj=on}} flying-off deck forward, intended for aircraft with wheeled [[Landing gear|undercarriages]], and a prominent hangar aft. A massive latticework [[gantry crane]] protruded aft from the hangar roof and a twin-boom [[derrick]] forward were fitted to handle her aircraft. The smaller forward hangar was built under the ship's [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and the aircraft were raised to the flight deck overhead by a {{convert|22|x|14|ft|m|1|adj=on}} [[Lift (elevator)#Aircraft elevators|lift]], one of the first in the RN. The forward hangar could fit four single-seat fighters and the rear hangar had a capacity of four [[floatplane]]s. The ship could lower them into the water while steaming at {{convert|19|kn}} and recover the floatplanes at {{convert|6|kn}}. She carried {{convert|1200|impgal}} of [[petrol]] for her aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1988, pp. 51–52, 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her service, ''Nairana'' carried [[Beardmore W.B.III]], [[Fairey Campania]], [[Short Type 184]], and [[Sopwith Baby]], [[Sopwith Pup|Pup]], and [[Sopwith Camel|2F1 Camel]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 38, 110, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Military service===
Upon commissioning on 25 August 1917, ''Nairana'' was assigned to the Battle Cruiser Force of the Grand Fleet at [[Scapa Flow]],&lt;ref name=l3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plowman54&gt;Plowman, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying four Short Type 184 floatplanes and four Beardmore W.B.III aircraft.&lt;ref name=f1/&gt; She saw little operational use as she was employed for pilot training and ferrying aircraft to ships equipped with flying-off decks.&lt;ref name=l3/&gt;

In 1918, ''Nairana''  participated in the [[North Russia Intervention|North Russia Campaign]] in support of the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. On 1 August she took part in what was probably the first fully combined air, sea and land military operation in history, when she and her Campania seaplanes joined [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] ground forces and other ships in driving the [[Bolshevik]]s out of their fortifications on [[Modyugski Island]] at the mouth of the [[Northern Dvina River]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobson &amp; Miller, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nairana'' used her own guns on the Bolshevik batteries.&lt;ref name=Plowman54/&gt; She and her aircraft then scouted ahead of the Allied force as it proceeded up the channel to [[Arkhangelsk]]. The appearance of one of her Campanias over Arkhangelsk caused the Bolshevik troops there to panic and abandon the city.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson &amp; Miller, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nairana'' sustained no damage during the assault.&lt;ref name=Plowman54/&gt; As of October, the ship was carrying five Campanias and two Sopwith Babys, although these last two aircraft were replaced by Sopwith Camels in 1919.&lt;ref name=f1/&gt;

By May 1919, ''Nairana'' was refitting in [[Rosyth]].&lt;ref name=rn&gt;Royal Navy Log Books&lt;/ref&gt; She then ferried a flight of [[Fairey III]]C floatplanes to North Russia for use by the [[Royal Air Force]]&lt;ref&gt;Dobson &amp; Miller, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; later in the month. She remained at Murmansk for several weeks before proceeding on to [[Kem, Russia|Kem]]. There the ship was inspected by [[Rear-Admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] [[John Green (Royal Navy officer)|John Green]], Rear-Admiral Commanding in the [[White Sea]], on 29 July. At the end of August, ''Nairana'' proceeded to [[Onega, Russia|Onega]] where her aircraft observed for the [[monitor (warship)|monitor]] {{HMS|Erebus|I02|6}} as the latter bombarded the town for several days before returning to Kem. She departed Russia on 8 October and arrived back at Rosyth four days later. Later that month the ship was transferred to [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] to begin the process of [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioning]] from naval service.&lt;ref name=rn/&gt;

===Ferry service===
The British Government sold ''Nairana'' to William Denny and Brothers after her service in Russia to be rebuilt to her original plans, and the ship was handed over to Huddart Parker in January 1921. ''Nairana'' arrived in Melbourne in March, after a two-month voyage from [[Plymouth]], and commenced her first [[Bass Strait]] crossing on 18 April 1921.&lt;ref name=Plowman54/&gt; She was registered in [[Melbourne]] under the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|British flag]] and was allocated the United Kingdom official number 143765, and the [[code letters]] THPM.&lt;ref name=Nairana30&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30b0832.pdf |title=Lloyd's Register, Navires a Vapeur et a Moteurs |journal=Lloyd's Register |author=Lloyd's of London |year=1930 |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transferred to [[Tasmanian Steamers]] in January 1922,&lt;ref&gt;Plowman, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; she operated the Bass Strait run from [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[Devonport, Tasmania|Devonport]], and [[Burnie, Tasmania|Burnie]] to Melbourne for the next 26 years. She accommodated 250 passengers in first class and 140 in second, and generally cruised at {{convert|18|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; She was withdrawn from service for overhaul at Sydney's [[Cockatoo Island (New South Wales)|Cockatoo Island]] in October 1922, and again in September–October 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman, pp. 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1925 ''Nairana'' was chartered by the Federal Government and crewed by non-union labour, following a strike by shipping workers.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman, pp. 60–64.&lt;/ref&gt; She was taken out of service for a major overhaul at Cockatoo Island from May to October 1927. On the night of 24 January 1928, she was struck by a rogue wave in heavy seas, and almost capsized; one woman, already ill when she boarded in Launceston, died.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nairana (AWM 303672).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Nairana'' as a Bass Strait ferry between the wars|alt=Black and white photograph of passenger ship with twin funnels, under steam]]
As well as passengers, ''Nairana'' regularly carried cargo, including gold bullion, and live animals such as horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A [[Tasmanian devil]] being transported to [[Melbourne Zoo]] in a wooden crate placed in one of the ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box, and was never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman, p. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY.&lt;ref name=Nairana34&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=34b0592.pdf |title=Lloyd's Register, Steamers &amp; Motorships |journal=Lloyd's Register |author=Lloyd's of London |year=1934 |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nairana'' was withdrawn from service in December 1935 as a result of a ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared [[Port Phillip|Port Phillip Bay]] on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the [[Yarra River]], having sustained only minor damage.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Military history of Australia during World War II|war was declared]] in September 1939, ''Nairana'' began carrying military personnel as well as commercial passengers. Her hull, previously black, was painted grey, and she was fitted with [[Paravane (weapon)|paravanes]] to defend against mines, a [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|BL (breech-loading)]] [[BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VIII|4-inch Mk VIII]] anti-submarine gun on the aft [[promenade deck]], and a [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&amp;nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] anti-aircraft gun on her deckhouse. She also carried some [[.303 British|.303 rifles]] for shooting at mines.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman, pp. 57, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; As a coal burner that emitted tell-tale black smoke visible for miles, ''Nairana'' was not considered for war service, the only Bass Strait ferry not to be requisitioned. She thus became the sole commercial passenger vessel to operate between Tasmania and the mainland through the war years, maintaining a heavy schedule. The ship underwent repairs for 13 days at [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]], Victoria, after running aground in the [[Tamar River]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=Plowman92&gt;Plowman, pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nairana'' had her final overhaul at Cockatoo Island between February and April 1944.&lt;ref name=Plowman92/&gt; By mid-1947, airlines had captured a significant portion of the passenger trade across Bass Strait, and ''Nairana''{{'}}s schedule was reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22449961 |title=Airways capturing Strait traffic |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=24 July 1947 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=20 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22507521 |title=Planes 'stop' the Nairana |newspaper=The Argus |location=Melbourne |date=15 September 1947 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December, her captain collapsed and died as he was speaking to two of his officers while the ship was alongside in Burnie; a post-mortem examination attributed the death to heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69066034 |title=Sudden death of Nairana's captain |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Australia)|The Advocate]]|location=Burnie, Tasmania |date=1 January 1948 |accessdate=7 February 2015 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nairana'' made her last crossing from Tasmania to the mainland on 13–14 February 1948, after which she was retired and laid up in Melbourne. Sold for scrap to William Mussell Pty Ltd, Williamstown, ''Nairana'' broke her moorings during a [[gale]] on 18 February 1951 and was driven ashore off [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Port Melbourne]]. Unrecoverable, she was broken up in place in 1953–54.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Throughout her career as a Bass Strait ferry, ''Nairana'' had displayed a commemorative plaque and a photograph from her days as a carrier, presented by the British [[Admiralty]] in recognition of her service in World War I, and especially her part in the fall of Arkhangelsk. After she was retired, the plaque went on display at the [[Museum of Wellington City &amp; Sea]], New Zealand, and the photograph at the [[Launceston Maritime Museum]], Tasmania.&lt;ref name=Plowman54/&gt;
