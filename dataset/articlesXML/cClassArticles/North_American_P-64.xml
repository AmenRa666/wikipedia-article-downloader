The '''North American P-64''' was the designation assigned by the [[United States Army Air Corps]] (USAAC) to the [[North American Aviation]] '''NA-68''' fighter, an upgraded variant of the '''NA-50''' developed during the late 1930s. Seven NA-50s were purchased by the [[Air Force of Peru|Peruvian Air Force]], which nicknamed it ''Torito'' (&quot;Little Bull&quot;).

Six NA-68s ordered by the [[Royal Thai Air Force]] were seized before export by the US government in 1941, after the [[Franco-Thai War]] and growing ties between [[Thailand]] and the [[Empire of Japan]]. These aircraft were used by the USAAC as unarmed fighter trainers.

The Peruvian NA-50s subsequently saw action during the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941.

==Design and development==

===NA-50===
[[File:North American NA-50 fighter 'Torito'.jpg|thumb|NA-50 &quot;Torito&quot; destined for Peruvian service]]

The North American Aviation '''NA-50''' was developed as a simple single-seat, low-wing, single-engined fighter for export. The design was developed from the [[North American NA-16|NA-16]]/[[North American BT-9|BT-9]] basic training aircraft of 1935. The NA-16 evolved into a series of aircraft that were some of the most widely used advanced and basic training aircraft produced by any country, and provided the basic design for a single-engined fighter intended for small countries that needed a simple aircraft with modern capabilities and features.

The NA-50 ''Torito'' (Spanish slang for &quot;little bull&quot;), built for Peru, was a single-seat fighter design based on the two-seat Basic Combat Demonstrator NA-44. The NA-50 was powered by an 840&amp;nbsp;hp (626&amp;nbsp;kW) Wright R-1820-G3 radial air-cooled [[engine]] that gave the NA-50 a top speed of 295&amp;nbsp;mph at 9,500 feet. It was armed with two .30&amp;nbsp;in (7.62&amp;nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun]]s. The aircraft were manufactured in May 1939, and test-flown at the factory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green p. 134&quot;&gt;Green 1961, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NA-68===
In 1940, the [[Royal Thai Air Force]] ordered six aircraft similar to the NA-50 that were designated '''NA-68'''. The changes in the NA-68 included a modified landing gear, new outer wings, heavier armament, and redesigned tail surfaces similar to those adopted on later production trainers. North American test pilot Lewis Waite flew the first NA-68 on 1 September 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gates&quot;/&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:USAAC P-64.jpg|thumb|right|USAAC P-64]]

Peru purchased seven aircraft for the [[Air Force of Peru|Peruvian Air Force]], with deliveries completed in May 1939. In Peruvian service, these aircraft were fitted with bomb racks under the [[fuselage]] for light bombs. The Peruvian NA-50s took part in the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian war]] of July 1941, supporting [[Army of Peru]] ground forces.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Tom Cooper and Esteban Rivera.[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_164.shtml &quot;The Most Powerful Air Force in Latin America.&quot;] ''Acig.org'', 1 September 2003. Retrieved: 26 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the NA-68s (along with a parallel order for [[North American A-27|NA-69 two seaters]]) ordered by the [[Royal Thai Air Force]] were en route to [[Thailand]] when their export clearance was cancelled and were returned to the United States where they were assigned the designation P-64, disarmed, and used for advanced fighter training.

==Survivors==
* NA-50 ''XXI-41-3'' (c/n 50-950). One of the original seven NA-50s built is displayed on a pedestal in front of the [[Museo Aeronáutico del Perú]] at [[Las Palmas Air Base]], [[Lima]], [[Peru]], next to the Mausoleum of Captain [[José Quiñones Gonzáles]], (a Peruvian hero who died flying an NA-50). This example was initially assigned to Escuadrón de Aviación No.1 (Chiclayo Field) and was later transferred to the 28th Advanced Fighter Training Group, 4th squadron until retired in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, David.

* NA-68A ''41-19085'' (c/n 68-3061). One of the six intercepted Thailand-bound P-64s which survived being used for training and liaison is now displayed at the [[EAA AirVenture]] Museum. This aircraft has been restored to flying condition, with the engine running again in 2013, followed by its first flying appearance  at the 2016 EAA AirVenture Oshkosh airshow.
