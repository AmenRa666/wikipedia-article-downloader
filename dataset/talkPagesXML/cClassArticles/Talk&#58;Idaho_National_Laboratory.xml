== Updated Name ==
The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) is now known as the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Alsot is now operated by Battelle, rather than Bechtel. Much more information in the article may need to be updated since the management change.
:I have updated the name for this, changing it to Idaho National Laboratory [[User:Magicmonster|Magicmonster]] 20:51, 10 August 2005 (UTC)


== Military History? ==
This has recently been tagged under the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history|Wikiproject Military History]]. I'm not sure it's really under the scope for the project. However, not knowing a great deal about the area, I'm not sure. If anyone has any reason for this to remain under the project, if they could outline why here. Thanks [[User:Rockfall|Rockfall]] ([[User talk:Rockfall|talk]]) 16:01, 10 March 2008 (UTC)

:Besides being originally started by the U.S. military and currently being a world leader in energy research and development, the INL (then NRTS) was being run under the direction of the U.S. Navy when two historical events occurred: The first town in the world was powered by nuclear energy; the first fatal reactor explosion occurred of the SL-1 reactor. I don't know the criteria for the Military History WikiProject and therefore I don't know if this qualifies it for that project but perhaps this information helps. [[User:Mtrentvander|Mtrentvander]] 13:29, 12 February 2009

::INL continues to have a strong relationship to the military. Over the years, the Navy has had a presence at the site due to the naval reactors used for submarines. The ATR Facility is still used by the Navy, responsible for a majority of tests. One of the three organizational areas of INL is Homeland Security. While it is the smallest of the three, there are major projects going on at INL under this function. [[User:Seelja|Seelja]] 12:15, 30 June 2009

:::As well, the Air Force and Army have used facilities at INL- the Air Force for its ill-fated nuclear airplane program and the Army for its much more successful tank armor program. Interestingly, both used the same hangar for their projects. [[User:Brett R. Stone|Brett R. Stone]] 2:11, 30 June 2009

:::::One of the most important facilities at INL (previously INEL or INEEL) has historically been the [[Naval Reactors Facility]] (NRF). In its hey-day, about 2/3 of the people working there were in the [[US Navy]], both trainees, trainers, and a few other workers/administrators. In addition to being a DOE facility, it was also a [[Naval Base]] with its own Captain as the [[Commanding Officer]] there. In addition to a few prime contractor employees, each prototype shift had a crew of Navy sailors working there headed by its own Shift Engineer, who was a Navy person, typically an officer. Sailors stood watches at these plants, just like they would for a ship. Naval Reactors (NAVSEA 08), an office consisting of Naval personnel (employees working for the Navy), had an Idaho Branch Office (IBO) there. NRF had the first [[Naval reactor]] plant, a prototype called [[S1W]], which was the predecessor nuclear plant for the first nuclear power-propelled submarine, the [[USS Nautilus]]. NRF also had the first prototype, [[A1W]], for the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the [[USS Enterprise]]. There was still a third prototype there, a submarine plant called [[S5G]], the predecessor for the submarine [[USS Narwhal]]. About 39000-40000 sailors were trained and nuclear-qualified at these prototypes over the course of about 35-40 years. &lt;br&gt;[[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] ([[User talk:H Padleckas|talk]]) 04:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

In addition to what else has been mentioned:  The SL-1 reactor was U.S. Army reactor (though the accident was probably the driver that ended the Army's interest in portable nuclear power plants). The ICPP (now INTEC) reprocessed Navy nuclear fuel (in addition to research reactor fuels).

Also, the original name for the S1W prototype at NRF was Submarine Thermal Reactor (STR).  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wrleach|Wrleach]] ([[User talk:Wrleach|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wrleach|contribs]]) 14:03, 5 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== [[We Almost Lost Detroit]] ==
''(Anon comment moved from the article.)''

I read in &quot;We Almost Lost Detroit&quot; that the bodies we're buried but the hands and heads were all severed off the bodies to be burried with the atomic waste. The third man found in the facility (which took a while to locate) was found &quot;impaled in the ceiling&quot; above the reactor. A control rod impaled him through his groin and out through his shoulder. It took a few weeks (if i'm not mistaken) to get him down. Read &quot;We Almost Lost Detroit&quot;. The facts are there. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:98.224.150.84|98.224.150.84]] ([[User talk:98.224.150.84|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/98.224.150.84|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Merger Proposal ==
The recently created page [[The idaho national laboratory water program]] probably is not a great candidate for a standalone article, but I think it can be merged here. Thoughts? [[User:Jminthorne|Jminthorne]] ([[User talk:Jminthorne|talk]]) 21:14, 2 June 2010 (UTC)
*'''Support''' but it should be a redirect from [[Mountain West Water Institute]], which is the actual name. However, that whole article reads like a INL brochure and looks like it was copy/pasted from somewhere...&amp;mdash;[[User:Scientizzle|Scien]]''[[User talk:Scientizzle|tizzle]]'' 20:35, 7 June 2010 (UTC)
**A lot of the text was directly lifted from INL's own website. I also support the merger. --[[User:Cakesmack|Cakesmack]] ([[User talk:Cakesmack|talk]]) 23:02, 16 January 2011 (UTC)

== Facilities not mentioned in article ==

SPERT I, SPERT II, SPERT III, and SPERT IV
Special Power Excursion Reactor Test (SPERT)
These were reactors designed to study reactor transient behavior and reactor physics. The SPERT I tests results(following the SL-1 accident) were a very strong driver for CSR (Cold Stuck Rod) criteria.

PBF (Power Burst Facility)
An open tank 40 MwT (limited to 20 MwT) reactor with a pressurized test loop. Performed the world's first LOCA (loss of coolant accident) using LOFT (Loss of Fluid Test) reactor fuel rods. Was used to test for the actual failure point for reactor fuels.

ETR (Engineering Test Reactor)

EOCR (Experimental Organic Cooled Reactor) Never taken to critical operation.

TREAT (Transient Reactor Test) Facility

ZPPR (Zero Power Plutonium Reactor?)

== Primary sourcing ==

Most of the references for this article are written by staff members of INL, thereby being self promotional.  [[User:Dispenser/Reflinks|RefLinks]] has been run against this article leaving the attendant problems that I have been cleaning up.  I have left these reference in, updated to current &lt;nowiki&gt;{{site web}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; standards, noting that many of them mention other sources for the same material.  I'm geting rid of the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Cleanup-bare URLs}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and moving on. [[User:Softtest123|Softtest123]] ([[User talk:Softtest123|talk]]) 15:35, 27 July 2014 (UTC)

== INL's Mission ==

Apparently the mission of INL has changed since the [[Idaho_National_Laboratory#Interdisciplinary_projects|Interdisciplinary projects]] section was written. The statement regarding mission support needs to be reviewed and restated if necessary. [[User:Softtest123|Softtest123]] ([[User talk:Softtest123|talk]]) 18:20, 27 July 2014 (UTC)

== Hidden Ad? ==

&quot;And the ultrasonic crusher also needs to be better maintained when people use this equipment&quot;
