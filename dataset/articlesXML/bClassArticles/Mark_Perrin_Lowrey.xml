'''Mark Perrin Lowrey''' (December 30, 1828 &amp;ndash; February 27, 1885) was a [[Southern Baptist]] preacher otherwise known as the &quot;Preacher General&quot;.  He is known for being a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], for his works in the Mississippi Southern Baptist Convention, and for founding the [[Blue Mountain College]].

==Early life and career==
Mark Perrin Lowrey was born in 1828, in [[McNairy County, Tennessee]], to Adam and Marguerite (Doss) Lowrey.&lt;ref name=Wakelyn291&gt;Wakelyn, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents had emigrated to America from [[England]] and [[Ireland]], and Lowrey received no formal education.&lt;ref name=Warner195&gt;Warner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; His father died from yellow fever in Natchez Mississippi, when Lowrey was young.&lt;ref name=MPL&gt;[http://www.lib.usm.edu/~archives/m049.htm Rosewell G. Lowrey's &quot;Lowrey (Mark Perrin) Autobiographical Essay Summary&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843 he moved with his family to [[Mississippi]], where he became a bricklayer. During the [[Mexican-American War|Mexican War]] Lowrey enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the 2nd Mississippi Volunteers in 1847.&lt;ref name=Eicher355&gt;Eicher, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither he or his regiment ever saw action in the conflict, and Lowrey was mustered out in July 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Wakelyn, p. 291; Eicher, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war with Mexico ended, Lowrey married Sarah R. Holmes in 1849. Beginning in 1853 he became a [[Southern Baptist]] preacher, serving primarily around the village of [[Kossuth, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=Wakelyn291/&gt; After preaching for eight years the [[American Civil War]] broke out and his congregation urged him to join the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].&lt;ref name=M&gt;[http://www.historycentral.com/bio/CWcGENS/CSALowry.html Mark Perrin Lowrey Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Lowrey also served as a [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in the Mississippi State Militia in 1861.&lt;ref name=Eicher355/&gt;

==Civil War service==
Lowrey entered the Confederate service in 1861 as the [[colonel]] of the 4th Mississippi Militia. On December 6, 1861, Lowrey was appointed colonel of the [[Mississippi Civil War Confederate units#Confederate Army|4th Mississippi Infantry]], and on April 3, 1862, he became commander of the 32nd Mississippi Infantry.&lt;ref name=Eicher355/&gt; He fought in and was praised at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], [[Battle of Perryville]], the [[Kentucky Campaign]], and the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. At the [[Battle of Perryville]] in October 1862 Lowrey was shot in the left arm but stayed on the battlefield. During the retreat which began the next day he had great difficulty keeping up with the army. He then obtained leave and traveled to his brother's house for safety. After six weeks of recuperation Lowrey joined back with his forces and fought at the [[Battle of Murfreesboro]] on January 1, 1863.&lt;ref name=MHOCG&gt;Jack D. Welsh's &quot;Medical Histories of Confederate Generals&quot; (1999) pg. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M P Lowrey CSA ACW.jpg|left|thumb|Lowrey as a Confederate Army General officer]]
On October 4, 1863 at the age of 35 Mark Lowrey was promoted to a [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MHOCG&quot;/&gt; It was because of his evangelistic ties and preaching that he came to be known as the &quot;Preacher General&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPL&quot;/&gt; In December 1864 during the [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign]] an officer saw the flash of an enemy gun and yelled to Lowrey, who quickly lowered himself and the bullet stuck and killed a man behind him.&lt;ref name=&quot;MHOCG&quot;/&gt; Years of bad health and other reasons caused Lowrey to resign his commission as a brigadier general on March 14, 1865, almost one month before the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate forces]] surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Courthouse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MHOCG&quot;/&gt; Maj. Gen. [[Patrick Cleburne]], Lowrey's divisional commander during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, pronounced Lowrey &quot;the bravest man in the Confederate Army.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wakelyn291/&gt;

==Postbellum career and death==
After the war Lowrey moved back to [[Mississippi]] and focused on his studies.&lt;ref name=O&gt;Annah Walker Robinson Watson's &quot;Of Sceptred Race&quot; (1910) pg. 151-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1873 he founded the [[Blue Mountain College|Blue Mountain Female Institute]] which later became known as the [[Blue Mountain College]]. Lowrey would also serve as president of the Mississippi Baptist convention from 1868 to 1877.&lt;ref name=Wakelyn291/&gt;

Lowrey then persuaded a friend, Colonel William C. Falkner, to run his railroad near the college. Since he was a major shareholder of Falkner's Railroad the plan was soon carried out.&lt;ref name=EH&gt;Elmo Howell's &quot;Mississippi Home-Places: Notes on Literature and History&quot; (1988) pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The school became quite a success and 3 generations of Lowrey's became presidents of the school himself, two of his sons and a grandson. Following several years of teaching at the [[Blue Mountain College]] Lowrey became very sick and in 1882 his doctors alerted him that his heart was very weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;MHOCG&quot;/&gt; Then on February 27, 1885, while buying a train ticket at Middleton, Tennessee, he turned, gasped, and fell to the floor dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;MHOCG&quot;/&gt;

==Possible family wealth==
Lowrey lore states that sometime after Mark and Sarah were married an English grandfather of Lowrey's mother Margaret (Doss) Lowrey died leaving a six million dollar fortune to his descendants.&lt;ref name=&quot;O&quot;/&gt; Before the arrangements could be made for the family to get the money the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began and the descendants became preoccupied with other matters. At the war's end Lowrey once again tried to claim his share of the English estate left behind by his ancestor, but it was discovered that the papers pertaining to the money and estate were lost or destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;O&quot;/&gt;
