The '''[[Inter-Services Intelligence]]''' ('''ISI'''), intelligence agency of [[Pakistan]] has been involved in running  [[military intelligence]] programs in India, with one of the subsections of its Joint Intelligence Bureau (JIB) department devoted to perform various operations in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/pakistan/isi/ |title=Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |author=Pike, John |date=25 July 2002 |accessdate= 25 June 2012 |authorlink=John E.

India has also accused the ISI of reinvigorating terrorism in the country via support to [[pro-Khalistan]] militant groups such as the [[International Sikh Youth Federation]] (ISYF), in order to take revenge against India for its help in the [[liberation of Bangladesh]] as well as to destabilize the Indian State.&lt;ref name=SATPISYF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/punjab/terrorist_outfits/ISYF.htm|title=International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) South Asia Terrorism Portal article|publisher=The Institute for Conflict Management |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shah1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7czT4fipTyoC&amp;dq|author=Mehtab Ali Shah|title=The foreign policy of Pakistan: ethnic impacts on diplomacy, 1971-1994|year=1997|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-169-5|pages=149–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by India's [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB) indicated that ISI was &quot;desperately trying to revive Sikh&quot; militant activity in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/jun/10vicky.htm|title=200 Pak organisations raise funds for terror: IB|last=Nanjappa|first=Vicky|date=10 June 2008|publisher=Rediff.com|language=English|accessdate= 25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISI is also allegedly active in printing and supplying [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit]] [[Indian rupee]] notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chitkara2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

==History==
{{main|Inter-Services Intelligence#India}}
The ISI was created after the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]], due to the [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan]]'s (MI) weak performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/pakistan/isi.htm|title=Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence |accessdate=28 June 2012|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[General Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] [[Operation Fair Play|seized power]] in July 1977, he started his K2 (Kashmir and Khalistan) strategy, initiating [[Operation Tupac]].&lt;ref name=ghosh3&gt;Ghosh 2000 pg.3&lt;/ref&gt; He gave ISI the duty to make Jammu and Kashmir a part of Pakistan, and to send terrorists to Punjab.&lt;ref name=ghosh3/&gt; According to arrested ISI agents, the intelligence agency's aims are to confound [[Indian Muslims]] using [[Kashmiri Muslims]], extend the ISI network in India, cultivate terrorists and terrorist groups, cause attacks similar to the [[1993 Bombay bombings]] in other cities, and create a state of insurgency in Muslim-dominated regions.&lt;ref name=ghosh8&gt;Ghosh 2000 pg.8&lt;/ref&gt; The ISI has allegedly set up bases in [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]], which are used for operations in North-East India.&lt;ref name=ghosh8/&gt;

==Operations in Jammu and Kashmir==
About [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]] 24&amp;nbsp;million are paid out per month by the ISI, in order to fund its activities in [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;/&gt; [[Pro-Pakistani]] groups were reportedly favored over other militant groups.&lt;ref name=FAS/&gt; Creation of six militant groups in Kashmir, which included [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), was aided by the ISI.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;[http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/12/12/pakistan/index.html Does Obama understand his biggest foreign-policy challenge?], [[Salon.com]], 2008-12-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/world/asia/01pstan.html Pakistani Militants Admit Role in Siege, Official Says], [[The New York Times]], 2009-01-01&lt;/ref&gt; According to American Intelligence officials, ISI is still providing protection and help to LeT.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; The [[Pakistan Army]] and ISI also LeT volunteers surreptitiously penetrate from [[Pakistan Administrated Kashmir]] to Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;ref name=&quot;tellis2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Bad Company – Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and the Growing Ambition of Islamist Militancy in Pakistan |url=http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/111/tel031110.pdf| format=PDF| date=11 March 2010| author=Ashley J. Tellis| publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the degree of control that ISI retains over LeT's operations is not known.&lt;ref name='lisacurtis2010'&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Lisa |last=Curtis |contribution=Bad Company: Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and the Growing Ambition of Islamist Militancy in Pakistan |title=Testimony to US Congress Committee on Foreign Affairs |place=Washington, DC |date=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LeT was also reported to have been directed by the ISI to widen its network in the Jammu region where a considerable section of the populace comprised Punjabis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyespymag.com/terrorgroupsL-M.htm Lashkar-e-Taiba], ''Eyespymag''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged involvement in terrorist attacks==
{{main|Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism}}

===1993 Mumbai blasts===
The [[1993 Mumbai bombings]] were a series of 13 bomb explosions that took place in Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]), Maharashtra, India on Friday, 12 March 1993. The coordinated attacks were the most destructive bomb explosions in Indian history. The single-day attacks resulted in over 350 fatalities and 1,200 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Thomas |year=2001 |title=Wages of Violence: Naming and Identity in Postcolonial Mumbai |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-691-08840-2 |page=125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks were coordinated by [[Dawood Ibrahim]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/sep/22sheela.htm TADA court accepts Dawood's role in 1993 blasts]&lt;/ref&gt; don of the Mumbai-based international [[organised crime]] syndicate named [[D-Company]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |title= The Mumbai Blasts |author=James S. Robbins |work=[[National Review]] |date=12 July 2006 |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDc5MGNjYmEyYWQ1MmE1Y2NiYzY5ZTBhZmNmZDZmNmU= |accessdate=15 March 2007 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5PpcUg6uq |archivedate=24 June 2007| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ISI&quot;/&gt;

Ibrahim is believed to have ordered and helped organise the bombings in Mumbai, through one of his subordinates, [[Tiger Memon]]. The bombings are also believed to have been financially assisted by the expatriate Indian smugglers, Hajji Ahmed, Hajji Umar and Taufiq Jaliawala, as well as the Pakistani smugglers, Aslam Bhatti and Dawood Jatt. The Indian authorities have also alleged the involvement of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, in the blasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISI&quot;&gt;''Black Friday: the true story of the Mumbai bomb blasts'', S. Hussain Zaidi, Penguin Books, 2002, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===26/11 attacks===
[[Zabiuddin Ansari]], a Lashkar-e-Taiba militant accused for his involvement in the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]], said that ISI and [[Pakistani army]] officials were involved in planning the attacks and had attended the meetings.&lt;ref name=TOI_Saudi_help&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudis helped India nab 26/11 handler Abu Jundal|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-26/india/32423525_1_control-room-abu-jundal-mumbai-attacks|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=25 June 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68hCOOW5G|archivedate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Indian report, summarising intelligence gained from India's interrogation of [[David Headley]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-20101019&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101019/ap_on_re_as/as_india_mumbai_attack|title=Indian gov't: Pakistan spies tied to Mumbai siege|work=news.yahoo.com|agency=Associated Press|date=19 October 2010|accessdate=20 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101021114840/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101019/ap_on_re_as/as_india_mumbai_attack| archivedate= 21 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged that ISI had provided support for the attacks by providing funding for reconnaissance missions in Mumbai.&lt;ref name=&quot;fox-20101019&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/10/19/indian-report-pakistan-spies-tied-mumbai-siege/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fworld+%28Internal+-+World+Latest+-+Text%29|date=19 October 2010|accessdate=20 October 2010|title=Report: Pakistan Spies Tied to Mumbai Siege|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101122010702/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/10/19/indian-report-pakistan-spies-tied-mumbai-siege/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fworld+%28Internal+-+World+Latest+-+Text%29| archivedate= 22 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report included Headley's claim that Lashkar-e-Taiba's chief military commander, [[Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi]], had close ties to the ISI.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-20101019&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101019/ap_on_re_as/as_india_mumbai_attack|title=Indian gov't: Pakistan spies tied to Mumbai siege|work=news.yahoo.com|agency=Associated Press|date=19 October 2010|accessdate=20 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101021114840/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101019/ap_on_re_as/as_india_mumbai_attack| archivedate= 21 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He alleged that &quot;every big action of LeT is done in close coordination with [the] ISI.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fox-20101019&quot;/&gt;

In 2012 Pakistani civilian security agencies told Pakistan courts that &quot;suspects in the Mumbai attacks case got training at various centres of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant organisation, including navigational training in Karachi&quot; &amp; &quot;suspects, who allegedly participated in the attacks, were trained at the LeT training centres at Yousaf Goth in Karachi, Buttle in Mansehra, Mirpur Sakro in Thatta and Muzaffarabad&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/763139/mumbai-case-suspects-trained-at-let-camps&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mumbai train blasts===
ISI was alleged of planning the [[2006 Mumbai train bombings]] and the Indian government said that the ISI, LeT and [[Students Islamic Movement of India|SIMI]] planned the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/09/30/india.bombs/index.html?section=cnn_world#|title=Pakistan spy agency behind Mumbai bombings|author=CNN|date=30 September 2006|accessdate=30 September 2006|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counterfeit Indian rupee notes==
The ISI has been alleged to print counterfeit [[Indian rupee]] notes, which are believed to be printed in [[Muzaffarabad]].&lt;ref name=ghosh101&gt;Ghosh 2000 pg.101&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2000, the Nepal police raided Wasim Saboor's house, who was an official of the [[List of diplomatic missions of Pakistan|Pakistani embassy]] of [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref name=ghosh102&gt;Ghosh 2000 pg.102&lt;/ref&gt; They found fifty thousand Indian rupee notes, each of Rs. 50 denomination.&lt;ref name=ghosh102/&gt;
