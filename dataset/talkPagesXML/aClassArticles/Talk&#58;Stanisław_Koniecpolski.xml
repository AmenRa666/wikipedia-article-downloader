*The following suggestions were generated by a semi-automatic [[User:AndyZ/peerreviewer.js|javascript program]]. They &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;may or may not be accurate&lt;/font&gt; for the article in question (due to possible javascript errors/uniqueness of articles). If the following suggestions are completely incorrect about the article, please drop a note on [[User talk:AndyZ|my talk page]].
{{#if:{{{1|}}}|*The article has a few or too many inline external links, which hamper the readibility of the article.

*Per [[WP:MOSNUM#Units of measurement|WP:MOSNUM]], there should be a no-break space - &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; between a number and the unit of measurement.

==Carification requests==

A few weeks ago I put in a citation request here for &quot;and on 8 June the [[Treaty of Kurukove]] was reinstated.&quot; It was answered by this book ref [http://books.google.com/books?id=NCzzxNisc1MC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Stanis%C5%82aw+Koniecpolski&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]. Radek, I believe you inserted that ref to support the clause, could you clarify how the book ref supports the citation request. I don't see June 8 mentioned in this context or Serhii Plokhy describing it as a reinstatement of the earlier treaty. [[User:Novickas|Novickas]] ([[User talk:Novickas|talk]]) 00:09, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

:Did you put in a citation request for that? The history here indicates that the citation was there (I can't remember if I'm the one who added it) before you became active on the article. Anyway, I'll look into it.[[User:Radeksz|radek]] ([[User talk:Radeksz|talk]]) 00:31, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

:Yup. Checking the history, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stanis%C5%82aw_Koniecpolski&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=302296374], what you actually made a citation request for was the next sentence in the same paragraph.[[User:Radeksz|radek]] ([[User talk:Radeksz|talk]]) 00:34, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

I was referring to this edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stanis%C5%82aw_Koniecpolski&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=302068166], where you inserted the Plohky ref immediately following the sentences &quot;Koniecpolski laid siege to [[Pereyaslav]], but lacking the support of artillery and infantry, he could not break its walls. The Cossacks, lacking supplies, agreed to negotiations, and on 8 June the [[Treaty of Kurukove]] was reinstated.&quot; The June 8th treaty date had been in the article a long time. It's better now, and since it no longer has a statement disagreeing with Subtelny, you could remove &quot;According to Subtelny&quot;.

The sentences &quot;...and captured the fortress of Korsun. Koniecpolski laid siege to Pereyaslav, but lacking the support of artillery and infantry, he could not break its walls. The Cossacks, lacking supplies, agreed to negotiations.&quot; are now unreferenced. The last one is somewhat at odds with Plokhy here [http://books.google.com/books?id=NCzzxNisc1MC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Pereiaslav+1630&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=wiR4SpOTN4fEMtvxkBM#v=onepage&amp;q=Pereiaslav%201630&amp;f=false]  where he states &quot;After protracted engagements between Polish and Cossack forces, a treaty that amounted to a ''de facto'' Cossack victory was signed at Pereiaslav in May 1630, increasing the register to 8,000 men.&quot; and here [http://books.google.com/books?id=tW_eEVbVxpEC&amp;pg=PA788&amp;dq=Pereiaslav+1630+defeated&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=ACh4SuGzBqa-M8_doA4#v=onepage&amp;q=Pereiaslav%201630%20defeated&amp;f=false]: &quot;S.K...badly defeated in heavy fighting at nearby Pereiaslav. The Poles were forced to sue for peace.&quot; [[User:Novickas|Novickas]] ([[User talk:Novickas|talk]]) 12:28, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

:Right, I probably meant to reference the first sentence and first part of second (siege, could not break its walls, Cossacks lacking suppliesetc.) I think it's fine now. I've noticed the discrepancy with the other sources in how the outcome is described. Will look into it in more detail shortly.[[User:Radeksz|radek]] ([[User talk:Radeksz|talk]]) 12:33, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

A Plokhy ref is also being used to support the sentence &quot;In 1630 Taras executed Hryhoriy Chorny, who opposed the uprising.&quot; But Plokhy says &quot;Chorny was seized by the Zaporozhians and executed&quot;, no mention of Taras [http://books.google.com/books?id=NCzzxNisc1MC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=cossack+war+1630+taras&amp;ei=5DJ4StOFH4vWNdGx6DY&amp;client=opera#v=onepage&amp;q=cossack%20war%201630%20taras&amp;f=false] and Subtelny says &quot;...early in 1630, a group of Zaporozhians abducted him to the Sich where he was tried and executed. The Zaporozhians and nonregistered Cossacks now elected the daring Taras...&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Pereiaslav+1630+Chorny&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=aTR4Su3vFYPYNb_c0VE&amp;client=opera#v=onepage&amp;q=Pereiaslav%201630%20Chorny&amp;f=false] [[User:Novickas|Novickas]] ([[User talk:Novickas|talk]]) 13:20, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

==Mil hist project assessment==
As per a request on [[WP:MHA]] I have completed the checklist on the mil hist banner. I have rated it as a Start class article (please note the project banner does not support C class). The reason for this is the large number of citation needed tags means that it cannot pass criterion B1 (referencing). Also there are a number clarification tags (e.g. Which? and Who? etc.) hence I don't feel that I can pass it for criterion B2 (Coverage and Accuracy). The start class assessment is unfortunate, as I believe that the article is generally of a good standard and as such I ask contributors to not take the rating too personally. Once these issues have been address, you might like to consider requesting another mil hist assessment. This can be done by going to [[WP:MHA]] and adding the article to the list. Cheers. — [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 15:59, 2 September 2009 (UTC)
:As I mentioned in the FARC discussion, I don't think I'll have time (and sources) to work on this till XMAS. At that point I should be able to add the missing refs and clarify the remaining issues. Do note that anybody with access to Podhorodecki's book could do this. --&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 19:39, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

== Stutter, lisp, both? ==

Near the start of the article it says he had a stutter, near the end, a lisp. Is it one or both? If both, it might make more sense to mention them both in the same place. ([[User:Hohum|&lt;font color=&quot;Green&quot;&gt;'''Hohum'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Hohum|&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;@&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]) 19:09, 29 March 2011 (UTC)
:Good catch. I am pretty sure it was stutter, and correct it as so. --&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 20:07, 29 March 2011 (UTC)
