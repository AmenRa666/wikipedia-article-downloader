The '''537th Airlift Squadron''' is an inactive [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] of the [[United States Air Force]].  The unit was last active at [[Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson]] Alaska, where it was inactivated on 13 September 2013.

The squadron was first established during [[World War II]] as the '''537th Fighter Squadron'''.  It served as a Replacement Training Unit for [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] pilots until it was disbanded in a major reorganization of the [[Army Air Forces]] in 1944 designed to streamline training organizations.

In 1952, the squadron was redesignated as the '''537th Troop Carrier Squadron''', and activated at [[Atterbury Air Force Base]] to replace elements of the '''923d Reserve Training Wing'''.  The following year the squadron was inactivated and replaced at Atterbury by the [[73d Troop Carrier Squadron]].

The unit was activated again in Viet Nam as a [[C-7 Caribou]] squadron assigned to the [[483d Tactical Airlift Wing]] the squadron was awarded three [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citations]] for its actions during the [[Vietnam War|Viet Nam War]].

In 2011, the unit was re-activated and designated the '''537th Airlift Squadron'''.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:P-47-2.jpg|thumb|P-47 Thunderbolt as used by the 537th Fighter Squadron for training]]
The squadron was first established as the '''537th Fighter Squadron''' and was activated in November 1943 at [[Richmond Army Air Base]], Virginia,&lt;ref name=Maurer537FS&gt;{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II|origyear=1969|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/combat_sq_of_the_af_wwii.pdf |edition= reprint|year=1982|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-405-12194-6|oclc=72556|lccn=70605402|page=644}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the four original squadrons of the [[87th Fighter Group]].&lt;ref name=Maurer87FG&gt;{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II|origyear= 1961|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/af_combat_units_wwii.pdf |edition=reprint|year=1983|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-02-1|lccn=61060979|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The squadron began operations with [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s as a Replacement Training Unit (RTU).  RTUs were oversized units which trained [[aircrew]]s prior to their deployment to combat theaters and assignment to an operational group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Craven, Wesley F |editor2= Cate, James L|title=The Army Air Forces in World War II|volume=Vol. VI, Men &amp; Planes|year=1955|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|lccn=48003657|page=xxxvi|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1944, the squadron and the '''546th Fighter Squadron''' moved to [[Millville Army Air Field]], New Jersey,&lt;ref name=Maurer537FS/&gt; and the 87th group's [[headquarters]] and other squadrons transferred to [[Camp Springs Army Air Field]], Maryland.&lt;ref name=Maurer87FG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 643–644&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[Army Air Forces]] found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission.  Accordingly a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.&lt;ref&gt;Craven &amp; Cate,  ''The Organization and its Responsibilities'', Chapter 2: The AAF  p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;  while the groups and squadrons acting as RTUs were disbanded or inactivated.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Units'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  This resulted in the squadron being disbanded in the spring of 1944&lt;ref name=Maurer537FS/&gt; and being replaced by the '''135th AAF Base Unit''' (Fighter), which assumed its mission, personnel, and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/175/608.xml Abstract, History of Millville AAF 1940–1944] Retrieved December 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air Force Reserves===
{{Main|87th Air Base Wing}}
In 1952 the squadron was redesignated as the '''537th Troop Carrier Squadron''', became part of the newly constituted [[87th Troop Carrier Wing]] under the [[Hobson Plan|wing base organization]] system, and was activated at [[Atterbury Air Force Base]].  The 87th wing replaced the '''923d Reserve Training Wing''' at Atterbury when reserve flying operations resumed there.&lt;ref&gt;The 923d had been activated in 1951 when the reserve '''434th Troop Carrier Wing''' was called to active duty for the Korean War.&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadron operated [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s to train reservists.  In February 1953 the [[434th Troop Carrier Group]] was released from active duty and activated in the reserves, and its [[73d Troop Carrier Squadron]] assumed the mission, personnel and equipment of the 537th.&lt;ref name=Ravenstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Ravenstein|first=Charles A.|title=Air Force Combat Wings, Lineage &amp; Honors Histories 1947–1977|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/combat_wings.pdf |year=1984|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-12-9|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War===
{{Main|483d Tactical Airlift Wing}}
[[File:C-7B 535TAS 483TAW CamRanh Oct1971.jpg|thumb|DeHavilland C-7A of the 483d Tactical Airlift Wing at [[Cam Rahn Bay]] in 1971]]
The squadron was activated in 1967, and took over [[DeHavilland Canada C-7A Caribou]] aircraft that were formerly operated by the 17th Aviation Company of the [[U.S. Army]] in [[South Vietnam]], adopting the tactical [[airlift]] mission. The squadron initially maintained a detachment at [[An Khe]], which had been the 17th's base.  It operated from [[Phù Cát Air Base]]. The 537th earned a [[Navy Presidential Unit Citation]], as well as an Air Force Presidential Unit Citation for airlift support of [[Battle of Khe Sanh|Khe Sanh]] and other forward bases from January to May 1968.  It earned a second Air Force Presidential Unit Citation for action between April and June 1970&lt;ref name=537ASfacts/&gt; when it participated in the aerial resupply of [[Dak Seang Camp|Dak Seang Special Forces Camp]], evacuation of over 2000 refugees from Cambodia, and transportation of the Presidential Southeast Asia Investigation Team to various remote locations in South Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Alaska===
The squadron was redesignated as the '''537th Airlift Squadron''' and activated at [[Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson]], Alaska in 2011 to augment the [[144th Airlift Squadron]] of the [[Alaska Air National Guard]].  Its primary mission was to support [[United States Army|Army]] [[airborne forces]] training.  The squadron was inactivated due to cuts in the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] budget resulting from [[budget sequestration in 2013|sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Air Forces, [http://www.pacaf.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123363409 537th Airlift Squadron inactivates] Retrieved December 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
