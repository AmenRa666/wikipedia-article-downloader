[[Lieutenant Colonel]] '''Ewan Murray Robson''' {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|CBE|DSO}} (7 March 1906 – 26 August 1974) was an Australian lawyer, soldier and a member of the New south Wales Parliament for over twenty years. Known for most of his life as '''Murray Robson''', he was born in Sydney and educated at [[Newington College]] and the [[University of Sydney]], where he gained degrees in arts and law. After working several years as a [[Solicitor]], Robson stood for, and was elected to, parliament on 29 August 1936 at a by-election for the seat of [[Electoral district of Vaucluse|Vaucluse]]. He served many years on the backbenches, he enlisted in the [[Second World War]] and served with distinction during the war, gaining promotion to [[lieutenant colonel]] and receiving the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his service.&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web| title =Ewan Murray Robson (1906–1974)  | work =Members of Parliament | publisher =[[Parliament of New South Wales]]| url =http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/members.nsf/1fb6ebed995667c2ca256ea100825164/5b2fd5d3f79bd038ca256e530011f616?OpenDocument| accessdate = 23 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to politics, he had missed the foundation of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in 1945. When long-time Leader [[Vernon Treatt]] resigned the leadership in 1954 and contests between Deputy Leader [[Robert Askin]] and [[Pat Morton]] became deadlocked he was asked to stand and was consequently elected as party leader and [[Leader of the Opposition (New South Wales)|Leader of the Opposition]]. He served little more than a year before he was deposed by [[Pat Morton]]. In 1957 he retired from politics and returned to his legal career before retiring. He died of a heart attack in August 1974.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web| first=Michael| last=Hogan| title =Robson, Ewan Murray (1906–1974) | publisher =[[Australian National University]]| work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]| url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160137b.htm?hilite=Ewan%3BMurray%3BRobson| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Murray Robson was born in [[Ashfield, New South Wales]] on 7 March 1906, the second son of long-serving NSW politician [[William Robson (Australian politician)|William Elliott Veitch Robson]] and Mabel Jackson Wise. His grandfather, [[William Robson (New South Wales politician)|William Robson]], was also a Member of the NSW Legislative Council from 1900 to 1920. Being educated at [[Newington College]] from 1918 to 1923, Robson graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (1927) and a [[Bachelor of Law]] (1930) at the [[University of Sydney]] whilst a resident of [[St. Paul's College, Sydney|St. Paul's College]].&lt;ref&gt;Newington College, &quot;Register of Past Students&quot; 1863–1998 (Syd, 1999) pg. 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Ewan Robson | publisher =University of Sydney| work=Alumni Sydneienses| url =http://www.bull.usyd.edu.au/as/| accessdate = 2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robson was admitted as a [[Solicitor]] on 4 June 1930 and practised with his father at Robson &amp; Cowlishaw. He married Lesley Alison Martin in 1931 at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Sydney and had two sons.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; When sitting [[United Australia Party]] (UAP) MP [[William Foster (Australian politician)|William Foster]] died in office, Robson stood as an Independent UAP candidate at the resulting by-election in Foster's vacated [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Vaucluse|Vaucluse]]. At the by-election on 29 August, he emerged successful, with 62.63% of the vote, becoming the third generation of his family to serve in the NSW Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Vaucluse – 1936 (by)| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1935/Vaucluse_1.htm| accessdate = 2011-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his election Robson joined the UAP but soon joined a group of Government backbenchers who were unhappy with the [[Bertram Stevens (politician)|Bertram Stevens]] government's economic management and the party's control over preselection, becoming prominent in the struggle that led to the resignation of the Premier Stevens and his replacement by [[Alexander Mair]] in August 1939.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; At the [[New South Wales state election, 1938|4 March 1938 election]], Robson retained his seat uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Vaucluse – 1938| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1938/Vaucluse.htm| accessdate = 2011-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
When the [[Second World War]] broke out, Robson initially enlisted as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] from 29 September 1939. On 25 December, Robson was granted a leave of absence from the NSW Parliament, with his father dealing with his affairs, and enlisted in the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] on 29 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/17669581?searchTerm=murray%20robson&amp;searchLimits=|title= M.L.A. ENLISTS IN A.I.F. – Leave of Absence Granted|work=The Sydney Morning Herald 25 January 1940 p11 |publisher=Australian National Library|accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embarking for Scotland with the 2nd/5th Field Regiment, [[Royal Australian Artillery]], in May 1940, he disembarked at [[Gourock]], [[Scotland]] on 18 June 1940. Transferring to the [[2/31st Battalion (Australia)|2/31st Battalion]] in the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], and was trained in the AIF School. On 3 March 1941, he left Britain, arriving in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre|Middle East]] on 9 March. On 9 May 1941, he was appointed to [[Captain (land)|captain]].&lt;ref name=archiv/&gt;

In June 1941 Captain Robson received a shrapnel wound to the foot while fighting in [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Syria]]. Attached to the Middle East Tactical School, he rejoined his unit in February 1942 and served with distinction in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], being promoted to [[Major (rank)|major]] on 8 October 1942. On 3 December 1942, Robson departed North Africa with his unit, disembarking at [[Brisbane, Queensland]], on 8 January 1943. On 11 June 1943, he was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] and given command of the 2/31st Battalion.&lt;ref name=archiv/&gt;

In August 1943 Robson sailed with his unit to [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] where he suffered bouts of malaria. He was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36297|supp=yes|startpage=5575|date=21 December 1943|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36486|supp=yes|startpage=1929|date=25 April 1944|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37898|supp=yes|startpage=1091|date=4 March 1947|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 1945 he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]], on a recommendation by his Commanding officer, Major General [[George Alan Vasey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36972|supp=yes|startpage=1304|date=6 March 1945|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DSO citation===
{{quote|''Government House, Canberra. 27th April, 1944.''

The KING has been graciously pleased to approve that the following be Mentioned in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the South-West Pacific: — Lt.Col. E. M. Robson (NX 349).

For courage, coolness, determination and resourceful leadership in the field. Throughout the New Guinea Campaign Lieut-Col Robson was outstanding in his leadership. His efficient handling of his command down Markham Valley to Lae, when his battalion carried out a major outflanking movement, was largely responsible for the rapid overpowering and destruction of the enemy. During the four months of the campaign, he continually made his early recess, and was constantly among his most forward troops. By his actions he inspired complete confidence in all under his command.|''(Sgd) G.A.Vasey, Maj-Gen. GOC 7 Aust. Div. 27 Feb. 1944''&lt;ref name=archiv&gt;&quot;Ewan Murray Robson&quot;, 1939–1948 National Archives Service records&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 1945 he led his unit in the invasion of [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Balikpapan]], [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo]], and in September accepted the surrender of Japanese forces under Major General Michio Uno at [[Banjarmasin|Bandjermasin]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Relinquishing command, he returned to Sydney and was placed on the Reserve of Officers in November before being discharged on 21 November 1945.&lt;ref name=nomroll&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=A&amp;veteranId=120212 World War II Nominal Roll:] Robson, Ewan Murray – Army Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
Upon demobilisation, Robson returned to his political career. His long absence during his war service had put pressure on his marriage and ended when his wife divorced him in 1947. He remarried soon after to Naomi Priscilla Gee at St Peter's Anglican Church, [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Watsons Bay]] on 9 December 1950. During his military service he had missed the political upheavals of the collapse of the UAP and the foundation of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in 1945. He retained his seat at the [[New South Wales state election, 1947|election]] on 3 May 1947, assisted by a young [[Robert Askin]], a former Sergeant in his battalion. Robson retained his seat again with 67.39%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Vaucluse – 1947| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1947/Vaucluse.htm| accessdate = 2011-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later supported Askin in his bid to enter the Parliament in 1950.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Robson was re-elected with 68.37%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Vaucluse – 1950| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1950/Vaucluse.htm| accessdate = 2011-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was returned again at the [[New South Wales state election, 1953|14 February 1953 election]] unopposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Vaucluse – 1953| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales | url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1953/Vaucluse.htm| accessdate = 2011-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1954, after the long-serving leader, [[Vernon Treatt]], announced his intention to resign, and now-Deputy-Leader Askin and [[Pat Morton]] had tied in a vote to succeed him, Robson was persuaded by Askin to accept the Leadership of the Liberal Party as a compromise candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/18442153|title= Liberals Elect Robson As Leader|work=The Sydney Morning Herald 18 August 1954 p1 |publisher=Australian National Library|accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other senior members of the party, after having no conservative government since Alexander Mair in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, he had little interest in policy except for Cold War anti-communism, ignored majority views of his party and fellow parliamentary colleagues and further alienated party members by trying to forge a closer alliance with [[Michael Bruxner]]'s [[Australian Country Party (1920)|Country Party]].&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

Over a year after he assumed the leadership, at a party meeting on 20 September 1955, senior party member [[Ken McCaw]] moved that the leadership be declared vacant, citing that Robson's leadership lacked the qualities necessary for winning the next election. The motion was carried 15 votes to 5. Robson then moved a motion to prevent Pat Morton, who was the only person nominated for leader, from taking the leadership. This was defeated 16 votes to 6 and Morton was elected unnopposed as leader, with Robert Askin remaining as Deputy Leader. Robson retorted that there had been a &quot;continuous intrigue&quot; against his leadership.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book| last =Hancock| first =Ian | authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The Liberals: The NSW Division 1945–2000| publisher =Federation Press| year =2007| location =Sydney| page =pg 97|nopp=Y| url =| doi =| id =| isbn = 978-1-86287-659-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was returned for the last time at the [[New South Wales state election, 1956|3 March 1956 election]] with 71.41%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Vaucluse – 1956| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales | url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1956/Vaucluse.htm| accessdate = 2011-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robson, however, did not stay long afterward; on 26 July 1957, he resigned his seat and returned to his legal practice until he retired.&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt;

==Later life==
At the resulting [[Vaucluse state by-election, 1957|by-election]] on 24 August 1957, Vaucluse was held by the Liberals candidate, [[Geoffrey Cox (Australian politician)|Geoffrey Cox]], despite a significant reduction in the Liberal margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Vaucluse – 1946 (by)| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1946/Vaucluse_1.htm| accessdate = 2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In retirement he belonged to  the [[Royal Sydney Golf Club]], the Rose Bay Bowling Club and [[Union, University &amp; Schools Club|The University Club]].
He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1966 [[New Year Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=43854|supp=yes|startpage=23|date=31 December 1965|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August 1974, Robson died of a heart attack at his [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]] home, survived by his second wife and both his sons.&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt;
