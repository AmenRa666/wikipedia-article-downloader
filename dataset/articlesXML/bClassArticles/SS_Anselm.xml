'''SS ''Anselm''''' was a [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|British]] [[Steam turbine#Marine propulsion|turbine steamship]] of the [[Alfred Booth and Company|Booth Steamship Company]]. She was built as a [[Cargo liner|cargo]] and [[Passenger ship|passenger liner]] in 1935 and requisitioned and converted into a [[Troopship|troop ship]] in 1940. A German submarine sank her in 1941, killing 254 of those aboard.

==Building and civilian service==
The [[Alfred Booth and Company|Booth Steamship Company]] ordered ''Anselm'' for its passenger and [[cargo liner]] services between [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool]] and Brazil. [[William Denny and Brothers]] built her in their shipyard at [[Dumbarton]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]] in Scotland.

By the 1930s most British shipping companies specified [[Fuel oil#Bunker fuel|oil fuel]] for new steamships because it was more economical. Booth, however, still specified coal because it was cheaper, and as the company's ships carried little cargo on outward voyages to South America and it considered it could afford larger coal bunkers. ''Anselm''{{'}}s bunkers had capacity for 980 [[long ton]]s of coal.&lt;ref name=BlueStar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clyde/&gt;

''Anselm'' had nine corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of {{convert|176|sqft}} heating three single-ended Howden-Johnson [[water-tube boiler]]s&lt;ref name=BlueStar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clyde/&gt; with a combined heating surface of {{convert|7704|sqft}} that supplied steam at 250 [[Pounds per square inch|lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]].&lt;ref name=LR37/&gt; Booth had proposed a [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|multiple-expansion steam reciprocating engine]], with steam exhausted from the low-pressure cylinder then driving a low-pressure [[Steam turbine#Marine propulsion|steam turbine]] for greater efficiency.&lt;ref name=BlueStar/&gt; However, Denny persuaded Booth that it would be more economical to use pure turbine propulsion. Sources disagree as to whether she had three turbines or one three-stage [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] turbine.&lt;ref name=BlueStar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clyde/&gt; Either way, her power was rated at 696 [[Horsepower#Nominal horsepower|NHP]] and drove the shaft of her single [[propeller]] ''via'' [[Gear ratio|single-reduction gearing]].&lt;ref name=LR37/&gt;

==War service==
In November 1939 ''Anselm'' was in Liverpool and was due to sail to [[Pará River|Pará]] ''via'' for [[Lisbon]]. Because of war conditions she was to leave with Convoy OB 32G, which would then join [[Convoy OB 6]]. However, her sailing was cancelled and OB 32G left without her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 13 January 1940 she sailed from [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]] in Convoy SLF 16, which joined [[Convoy SL 16]] and reached Liverpool on 27 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 18 December 1940 ''Anselm'' left Britain with Military [[Convoy WS 5A]] bound for [[Suez]]. On Christmas Day 1940 the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper}} attacked ''Anselm'', but [[Royal Navy]] escort cruisers drove ''Hipper'' off and the convoy dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some accounts say she sailed from [[Gourock]]&lt;ref name=BlueStar/&gt;&lt;ref name=WMP/&gt; on the Firth of Clyde; another that she left [[Loch Ewe]] in northwest Scotland on 26 June;&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt; another that she left Liverpool in England on 28 June.{{sfn|Darling|2009|p=97}} Sources agree that she was escorted by the [[survey vessel]] {{HMS|Challenger|1931|6}} and {{sclass-|Flower|corvette}}s {{HMS|Lavender|K60|2}}, {{HMS|Petunia|K79|2}} and {{HMS|Starwort|K20|2}}. Some suggest that her escort also included the [[Armed merchantman#Armed merchant cruisers|armed merchant cruiser]] {{SS|Cathay|1924|2}}.&lt;ref name=U1030/&gt;

In the early hours of 5 July 1941 ''Anselm'' and her escorts were in mid-Atlantic, proceeding south through fog about {{convert|300|nmi|km}} north of the [[Azores]]. ''Challenger'' was leading the troop ship in line ahead; ''Starwort'' was stationed in line astern because her [[Sonar#ASDIC|ASDIC]] was out of order. ''Lavender'' and ''Petunia'' were in screening positions ahead, either side of ''Challenger''{{'}}s bow. At about 0350 hours the fog cleared, and the convoy began to zigzag as evasive action against possible attack.

However, a ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] ''Condor'' patrol had reported the convoy's position&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1996|p=}} cited in {{cite web

''U-96'' dived and the corvettes counter-attacked, ''Lavender'' firing six [[depth charge]]s and ''Petunia'' firing 20. When the attack drew too close to the survivors it was broken off, but the submarine was seriously damaged and broke off her patrol to return to [[Saint-Nazaire submarine base]] in [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|occupied France]] for repairs.&lt;ref name=U1030/&gt;

''Anselm'' launched all her lifeboats except no. 6, which had been damaged by the explosion.&lt;ref name=WMP/&gt; ''Challenger'' had been {{convert|1/2|nmi|m}} ahead but manoeuvred close to ''Anselm''{{'}}s port quarter and took off 60&lt;ref name=WMP/&gt; or more&lt;ref name=U1030/&gt; survivors as the troop ship's bow settled in the water.

Officers from the passenger accommodation were able to reach the [[Deck (ship)#Common names for decks|boat deck]], but the impact caused extensive damage below decks, where collapsed [[Glossary of nautical terms|overheads]] and wrecked ladders injured or trapped many of the men in one of the converted holds.&lt;ref name=Echo&gt;{{cite news

One officer who stayed aboard to the end was an Air Force [[Military chaplain|chaplain]] lately of [[RAF Bridgnorth]], [[Squadron leader#RAF usage|Squadron Leader]] [[Cecil Pugh]], who
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;seemed to be everywhere at once, doing his best to comfort the injured, helping with the boats and rafts... and visiting the different lower sections where men were quartered. When he learned that a number of injured airmen were trapped in the damaged hold, he insisted on being lowered into it with a rope. Everyone demurred because the hold was below the water line and already the decks were awash and to go down was to go to certain death. He simply explained that he must be where his men were.&quot;''&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;{{cite news

Most men aboard, including the majority of other ranks, did survive. ''Anselm''{{'}}s [[Sea captain|Master]], Andrew Elliot, 92 of her crew, three [[Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship|DEMS]] gunners and 965 troops were rescued.&lt;ref name=U1030/&gt; Many were at first in the water, but were picked up by ''Challenger'', ''Starwort'' or the ship's own lifeboats and rafts.

One [[leading aircraftman]], Wilfrid Marten, recalled being in the sea for a few hours and being &quot;near death's door&quot; before he was rescued by a lifeboat. An officer in the boat then ordered him to row, but was silenced by a Naval [[Enlisted rank|rating]] or [[petty officer]] who threatened to throw the officer over the side.&lt;ref name=WMP/&gt;

Most of the survivors in the boats and rafts were transferred to the escort ships, ascending the sides by [[Jason's cradle|scramble nets]]. This left ''Challenger'' and the corvettes badly overloaded, so the survivors were transferred again to HMS ''Cathay'' which landed them at Freetown.&lt;ref name=U1030/&gt; The escorts may have missed one lifeboat, as one survivor reports that after the sinking he spent 18 days in a boat with neither food nor water.&lt;ref name=WMP/&gt;
