:''For other ships of the same name, see [[SMS Prinz Adalbert]]''
'''SMS ''Prinz Adalbert''''' (&quot;His Majesty's Ship ''Prince Adalbert''&quot;){{refn|1=&quot;SMS&quot; stands for &quot;''[[Seiner Majestät Schiff]]''&quot; ({{lang-de|link=no|His Majesty's Ship}}). |group=Note}} was an [[armored cruiser]] built in the early 1900s for the German ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy), named after [[Prince Adalbert of Prussia (1811–1873)|Prince Adalbert of Prussia]], former Commander-in-Chief of the [[Prussian Navy]]. She was the lead ship of [[Prinz Adalbert-class cruiser|her class]], which included a second ship, {{SMS|Friedrich Carl||2}}. ''Prinz Adalbert'' was built at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Kiel]]. Her [[keel]] was laid in April 1900, and she was launched in June 1901. Her completion in January 1904 had been delayed by a surplus of construction projects at the Imperial Dockyard. She was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|21|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns, a significant improvement over the previous armored cruiser, {{SMS|Prinz Heinrich||2}}, which carried only two such guns. The ship was capable of a top speed of {{convert|20|kn|abbr=on}}.

Upon commissioning, ''Prinz Adalbert'' served as a gunnery [[training ship]], a role she held for the majority of her career. She trained with the ''Heimatflotte'' (Home Fleet), later renamed the ''[[Hochseeflotte]]'' (High Seas Fleet), throughout the early 1900s, and she made several visits to foreign countries. After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in July 1914, she was assigned to the reconnaissance forces in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and was tasked with protecting the German coast from Russian attacks. After her sister ship was sunk in November 1914, she became the [[flagship]] of the cruiser [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] in the Baltic. She conducted operations against Russian forces, including bombarding the port of [[Liepāja|Libau]] in support of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]. She was torpedoed by a British submarine in July 1915, but was able to return to port and was repaired. She was torpedoed a second time on 23 October 1915; the torpedo detonated her [[Magazine_(artillery)#Naval_magazines|ammunition magazine]]s and destroyed the ship. She sank quickly with heavy loss of life; only three men were rescued from a crew of 675. This proved to be the worst German naval disaster in the Baltic during the war.

{{main|Prinz Adalbert-class cruiser}}

''Prinz Adalbert'' displaced {{convert|9087|t|LT|abbr=on}} as built and {{convert|9875|t|LT|abbr=on}} fully loaded, with a length of {{convert|126.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a beam of {{convert|19.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a draft of {{convert|7.43|m|ftin|abbr=on}} forward. She was powered by three vertical [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]], with steam provided by fourteen coal-fired [[boiler]]s. The engines developed {{convert|17272|ihp|link=in}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|20.4|kn|lk=in|0}} on trials. She carried up to {{convert|1630|t|abbr=on}} of coal, which enabled a maximum range of up to {{convert|5080|nmi|link=on}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|12|kn}}. The ship's crew consisted of 35&amp;nbsp;officers and 551&amp;nbsp;enlisted men.{{sfn|Gröner|p=50}}

She was armed with four [[21 cm SK L/40 gun|{{convert|21|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns]] arranged in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one on either end of the [[superstructure]],{{sfn|Gröner|p=50}} a significant improvement over the preceding design, {{SMS|Prinz Heinrich||2}}, which carried only two guns in single turrets.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=34}} Her secondary armament consisted of ten 15&amp;nbsp;cm (5.9&amp;nbsp;in) guns, twelve {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} underwater [[torpedo tube]]s, one in the [[Bow (ship)|bow]], one in the [[stern]], and one on each [[Beam (nautical)|beam]]. The ship was protected by a {{convert|100|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} [[armored belt]] consisting of [[Krupp cemented armor]], along with an armored [[deck (ship)|deck]] that was {{convert|40|to|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick. Her [[main battery]] [[gun turret|turrets]] had faces {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} thick.{{sfn|Gröner|p=50}}

==Service history==
''Prinz Adalbert'' was ordered under the provisional name &quot;''B''&quot; and built at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Kiel]] under [[yard number|construction number]] 27.{{sfn|Gröner|p=50}}{{#tag:ref| German warships were ordered under provisional names. For new additions to the fleet, they were given a single letter; for those ships intended to replace older or lost vessels, they were ordered as &quot;Ersatz (name of the ship to be replaced)&quot;.{{sfn|Gröner|p=50}}|group=Note}} Her keel was laid in April 1900 and she was launched on 22 June 1901.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=35}}{{sfn|Gardiner, Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik|p=255}} The launching ceremony was attended by the Kaiser, [[Wilhelm II]], his wife Kaiserin [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Augusta Victoria]], his brother Admiral [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862–1929)|Prince Heinrich]] and Wilhem's son, [[Prince Adalbert of Prussia (1884–1948)|Prince Adalbert of Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence – Germany |day_of_week=Monday |date=24 June 1901 |page_number=7 |issue=36489}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony of christening the ship was performed by [[Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Irene of Prussia]], wife of Prince Heinrich, who then delivered a speech. [[Fitting-out]] work proceeded slowly, in large part the result of the Imperial Dockyard attempting to build too many ships at once, but the work was eventually completed by 12 January 1904. ''Prinz Adalbert'' was commissioned into the [[Imperial German Navy]] the same day for [[sea trial]]s, with ''[[Kapitän zur See]]'' (Captain at Sea) [[Hermann Jacobsen]] in command; the ship was slated for service as a gunnery [[training ship]].{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=35}}{{sfn|Gardiner, Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik|p=255}}{{#tag:ref|Fitting out work on the ship lasted for slightly over 30 months. In comparison, {{SMS|Friedrich Carl||2}}, her sister ship, was launched on 21 June 1902 and completed by 12 December 1903, a total of 18 months.{{sfn|Gröner|p=51}}|group=Note}} She had cost the Imperial German Government 16,371,000 [[German gold mark|''Goldmarks'']].{{sfn|Gröner|p=50}} Sea trials were completed by 30 May, after which ''Prinz Adalbert'' began her duties as a gunnery training ship.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=35}}

In September, the ship took part in the annual autumn maneuvers with the rest of the ''Heimatflotte'' (Home Fleet). A special training unit consisting of reserve ships, training ships like ''Prinz Adalbert'', and a flotilla of [[torpedo boat]]s was created in early 1905; ''Prinz Adalbert'' was the [[flagship]] of the unit from 1905 to 1907, flying the flag of ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (Rear Admiral) [[Hugo Zeye]]. ''Prinz Adalbert'' and the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Berlin||2}} escorted [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s yacht [[SMY Hohenzollern|''Hohenzollern'']] to Sweden for a visit to King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] in July 1905. The following month, she joined the light cruisers {{SMS|Undine||2}} and {{SMS|Nymphe||2}} for training maneuvers off [[Swinemünde]]; the exercises were to test the ships against a simulated night attack by torpedo boats. The tests were observed by ''Konteradmiral'' [[Ludwig Schröder]], the Inspector of Naval Weapons, aboard ''Prinz Adalbert''. Wilhelm II boarded ''Prinz Adalbert'' for the conclusion of the exercises, in which the ship towed an old torpedo boat filled with [[cork (material)|cork]] while the light cruisers and torpedo boats fired on it with live shells. ''Prinz Adalbert'' did not participate in the 1905 autumn maneuvers, though she was present for the [[naval review]] at the end of the exercises on 13 September. In February 1906, the [[Ship's tender|tender]] {{SMS|Fuchs||2}} was assigned to support ''Prinz Adalbert''. From 17 to 28 June, the cruiser served as the flagship of Prince Heinrich, then the commander of the Baltic Sea Naval Station. During this period the ship traveled to Norway to take part in the coronation festivities for King [[Haakon VII]].{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|pp=35–36}}

The cruiser again took part in the autumn maneuvers in 1907 and 1909. During the latter maneuvers, ''Prinz Adalbert'' took part in the Reserve Division, commanded again by Zeye, who had now been promoted to ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (Vice Admiral).{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|pp=35–36}} The ship served as the flagship of the [[III Scouting Group]], under ''Konteradmiral'' [[Johannes Merten]], who would go on to command the Ottoman fortifications at the [[Dardanelles]] during [[World War I]]. In March 1910 and March 1911, ''Prinz Adalbert'' conducted gunnery tests in the northern North Sea and visited [[Tórshavn]] and [[Vestmanna]] in the [[Faeroe Islands]]. She visited [[Ålesund]] in Norway in July and August that year. The ship's first period in service came to an end in September, following a large naval review in the Kiel [[roadstead]] for Wilhelm II and [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], the heir to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] throne, which began on 5 September. ''Prinz Adalbert'' was then decommissioned in Kiel on the 29th, with the armored cruiser {{SMS|Blücher||2}} taking her place as the fleet's gunnery training ship. After a lengthy [[:wikt:overhaul|overhaul]], ''Prinz Adalbert'' returned to service on 1 November 1912, again with the artillery school. She was based in [[Sonderburg]], where she replaced the armored cruiser ''Prinz Heinrich''.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=36}}

===World War I===
[[File:North and Baltic Seas, 1911.png|thumb|Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911]]

At the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, ''Prinz Adalbert'' was brought into front-line service with the fleet, and ''Kapitän zur See'' [[Andreas Michelsen]] took command of the ship. She was assigned to the [[IV Scouting Group]], under the command of ''Konteradmiral'' [[Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz]].{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|pp=34, 36–37}} On 26 August, she was sent to rescue the light cruiser {{SMS|Magdeburg||2}}, which had run aground earlier that day, though she was recalled after the Germans received word that ''Magdeburg''{{'}}s crew had been forced to [[scuttling|scuttle]] the ship. ''Prinz Adalbert'' was transferred to the North Sea on 7 September and was tasked two days later with protecting the minelaying cruisers {{SMS|Nautilus||2}} and {{SMS|Albatross||2}} and the auxiliary minelayer ''Kaiser'' while they laid a minefield to protect the southern entrance to the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]]. The ship was briefly detached to guard the [[Great Belt]] after the Germans received false intelligence suggesting that British warships would try to penetrate the Baltic. She then joined the [[High Seas Fleet]] for a sortie into the North Sea on 2–4 November.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=37}}

After her sister ship {{SMS|Friedrich Carl||2}} was sunk in November 1914,{{sfn|Gröner|p=51}} ''Prinz Adalbert'' was detached from the III Scouting Group{{clarify|date=November 2015|reason=Previous paragraph says IV Scouting Group}} to replace her in the Coastal Defense Division in the Baltic on 29 November. She became the flagship for Admiral [[Ehler Behring]], the commander of the cruiser detachment in the Baltic, on 7 December. On the 15th, she sortied with the light cruisers {{SMS|Augsburg||2}}, {{SMS|Lübeck||2}}, {{SMS|Amazone||2}}, and {{SMS|Thetis||2}} and several torpedo boats for a reconnaissance sweep toward the [[Åland Islands]]; the ships returned to port on 18 December without having engaged Russian forces. Another sweep followed on 27–29 December, this time to cover a sortie by the {{sclass-|Kaiser Friedrich III|battleship}} of the [[V Battle Squadron]] toward [[Gotland]]. On 6 January 1915, ''Prinz Adalbert'', ''Thetis'', ''Augsburg'', ''Lübeck'', and several torpedo boats and [[U-boat]]s went on a patrol toward [[Utö (Finland)|Utö]], where they discovered a Russian base for [[submarine]]s. The Germans planned to attack the base with the torpedo boats and ''Thetis'', since she had the shallowest draft, but due to a miscommunication, the attack was not carried out.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=37}}

On 22 January 1915, ''Prinz Adalbert'', in company with ''Augsburg'' and several torpedo boats, conducted another reconnaissance sweep toward the Åland Islands. While on the return voyage, she bombarded Russian positions at [[Liepāja|Libau]]. She ran aground off [[Gleźnowo|Steinort]] during the operation, and ''Augsburg'' struck a mine off [[Bornholm]].{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=37}}{{sfn|Halpern|p=187}} After being freed from her grounding, the ship was repaired; Michelsen temporarily served as the detachment commander in place of Behring from 13 February to 9 March, when the ship was ready to return to service. Behring returned to ''Prinz Adalbert'' on 20 March.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=37}} In the meantime, the Russians had briefly captured [[Klaipėda|Memel]]. The ''[[Admiralstab]]'' (Admiralty Staff) detached the [[II Battle Squadron]], [[II Scouting Group]], and two flotillas of torpedo boats from the High Seas Fleet to reinforce the forces in the Baltic. The ships began to make diversionary attacks to support the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s campaign to retake Memel; ''Prinz Adalbert'' supported one such operation, a raid of the II Scouting Group into the [[Bothnian Sea]] to attack Russian merchant shipping on 23 March.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|pp=37–38}} The following day, the ships from the High Seas Fleet were recalled to the North Sea, leaving Behring's cruisers alone once again.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=38}}

Behring conducted one last operation from 13 to 17 April, with ''Prinz Adalbert'', ''Thetis'', and ''Lübeck'', to support the minelayer {{SMS|Deutschland|1914|2}}, which laid a minefield off [[Hiiumaa|Dagö]]. On the 20th, the ''Admiralstab'' instituted a reorganization of the Baltic Sea forces, and Behring was replaced with ''Konteradmiral'' [[Albert Hopman]]. At the same time, Michelsen was promoted to Hopman's chief of staff, with his place as ''Prinz Adalbert''{{'}}s commanding officer being taken by ''Kapitän zur See'' Wilhelm Bunnemann.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|pp=34, 38}} The ship remained the flagship of the unit, and Hopman made his first cruise aboard the vessel from Kiel to Danzig on 27 April. At this time, ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' (General Field Marshal) [[Paul von Hindenburg]], the commander in chief of German forces on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], ordered a major assault on Libau. Hopman ordered his forces to support an attempt by the German Army to seize the city. The pre-dreadnoughts of the [[IV Battle Squadron]] and the IV Scouting Group were allocated to Hopman's command to provide additional support to the operation.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=38}}{{sfn|Halpern|p=191}} The attack took place on 7 May, and consisted of ''Prinz Adalbert'' and the armored cruisers {{SMS|Roon||2}} and ''Prinz Heinrich'', the elderly [[Coastal defence ship|coast defense ship]] {{SMS|Beowulf||2}}, and the cruisers ''Augsburg'', ''Thetis'', and ''Lübeck''. They were escorted by a number of destroyers, torpedo boats, and minesweepers.{{sfn|Halpern|pp=191–192}} The bombardment went as planned, though the destroyer {{SMS|V107||2}} struck a mine in Libau's harbor, which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship. German ground forces were successful in their assault and they took the city.{{sfn|Halpern|pp=192–193}}

On 1 July, the minelayer {{SMS|Albatross|1907|6}}, escorted by the cruisers ''Roon'', ''Augsburg'', and ''Lübeck'' and seven destroyers, laid a minefield north of [[Bogskär]]. While returning to port, the flotilla separated into two sections; ''Augsburg'', ''Albatross'', and three destroyers made for [[Rixhöft]] while the remainder of the unit went to Libau. ''Augsburg'' and ''Albatross'' were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev, consisting of three armored and two light cruisers.{{sfn|Halpern|pp=194–195}} Commodore [[Johannes von Karpf]], the flotilla commander, ordered the slower ''Albatross'' to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled ''Roon'' and ''Lübeck''. ''Albatross'' was grounded off Gotland and ''Augsburg'' escaped, and the Russian squadron briefly engaged ''Roon'' before both sides broke contact. Upon being informed of the situation, Hopman sortied with ''Prinz Adalbert'' and ''Prinz Heinrich'' to support von Karpf. While en route, the cruisers encountered the British submarine {{HMS|E9||2}}, which scored a hit on ''Prinz Adalbert''.{{sfn|Halpern|p=195}} The torpedo hit below the [[conning tower]], caused severe damage, and killed ten men. Hopman transferred to the torpedo boat {{SMS|V99||2}} while Michelsen remained aboard ''Prinz Adalbert'' to oversee the return to port. The ship took on some {{convert|2000|MT|abbr=on}} of water; her draft increased significantly, which prevented her from being able to put in to [[Danzig]]. She instead had to make the journey back to Kiel for repairs, which she reached on 4 July.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=39}}{{sfn|Polmar &amp; Noot|p=42}}

Repairs were finally completed by September 1915. On 21 September, ''Prinz Adalbert'' joined a sortie to the [[Gulf of Finland]] with the battleships {{SMS|Braunschweig||2}}, {{SMS|Elsass||2}}, {{SMS|Mecklenburg||2}}, {{SMS|Schwaben||2}}, and {{SMS|Zähringen||2}} and the light cruiser {{SMS|Bremen||2}}. They encountered no Russian forces and returned to port on the 23rd. Another operation followed on 5 October; this was in company with ''Prinz Heinrich'' and ''Bremen'', and was to cover a minelayer as it laid a field to the northwest of [[Östergarn]]. The ships completed their mission the next day and returned to port without incident. On 19 October, Hopman transferred his flag to ''Roon'' and ordered ''Prinz Adalbert'' to take up a patrol between [[Fårö]] and [[Dagerort]]. The ship was steaming some 20 miles west of Libau, en route to her patrol area, in company with a pair of destroyers on 23 October when she was intercepted by the submarine {{HMS|E8||2}}.{{sfn|Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=39}}{{sfn|Halpern|p=203}} ''E8'' fired a spread of torpedoes at a range of approximately 1,200&amp;nbsp;m (1,300&amp;nbsp;yd), detonating the ship's [[magazine (artillery)|ammunition magazine]].{{sfn|Polmar &amp; Noot|p=45}} The massive explosion destroyed the ship,{{sfn|Halpern|p=203}} which sank immediately with the loss of 672 crew.{{sfn|Gröner|p=51}} There were only three survivors. The sinking was the greatest single loss of life for the German Baltic forces during the war.{{sfn|Halpern|p=203}}
