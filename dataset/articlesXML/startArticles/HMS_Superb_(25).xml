'''HMS ''Superb''''' was a {{sclass-|Minotaur|cruiser (1943)|0}} [[light cruiser]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. The ship entered service in 1945 and had a brief, quiet career before being [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in 1957 after her modernisation was cancelled. She was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1960.

==Design and description==
''Superb'' was the last of the ''Minotaur''s to be built, and was completed to a slightly different design to that of the previous members of the class, with a foot more beam than her immediate predecessor {{HMS|Swiftsure|08|6}}, which had introduced Type 274 lock and follow radar directors for surface action. With ''Superb'' the first Type 275 sets, modified versions of the lock and follow radar, were introduced to also control anti-aircraft fire of the twin 4-inch mounts. Unfortunately the versions of 275 fitted were the British glasshouse director version, which had higher tolerances and less reliability than the American versions of the set, which were reserved for the latter {{sclass2-|Battle|destroyer}}s and [[aircraft carrier]]s {{HMS|Eagle|R05|2}} and {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|2}} under construction and in particular the last battleship, {{HMS|Vanguard|23|2}} for its secondary armament. Construction on her unfinished [[sister ship]]s was halted after the end of the war and they were later scrapped, or converted into the new {{sclass-|Tiger|cruiser|0}} automatic gun cruiser. ''Superb'' herself was planned to be converted to full automatic 6-inch and 3-inch/70 gun ''Tiger'' specifications and would have been much more suitable for such modernisation than the narrower beam ''Swifsure''. The plans to modernise ''Superb'' at the time of the 1957 Defence Review were much more cost constricted and would have been similar to the limited modernisation of {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}},&lt;ref&gt;N. Freidman. British Cruisers, Two World wars and After. Seaforth (2010)UK&lt;/ref&gt; with new MRS8 multi channel directors for four twin 4-inch and six twin proximity fused L70 Bofors and new radar, fire control and AIO&lt;ref&gt;D.Muffin. AA to AA. The Fijis Turn Full Circle. Warships 2010,London. p57.&lt;/ref&gt;  and a data link to the modernised carriers {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} and {{HMS|Hermes|R12|2}}. ''Superb''{{'}}s, update was cancelled in April 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Muffin. AA to AA. The Fijis. Warships 2010, p 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Superb''{{'}}s [[keel]] was laid by [[Swan Hunter|Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson]], of [[Wallsend]], [[Tyne and Wear]] on 23 June 1942. The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 31 August 1943 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 16 November 1945.

''Superb'' was involved in the [[Corfu Channel Incident]] in 1946, but otherwise had an unremarkable career. In 1953 she took part in the [[Fleet Review]] to celebrate the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|Coronation]] of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;Souvenir Programme, ''Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953'', HMSO, Gale and Polden&lt;/ref&gt; The cruiser spent some time as the [[flagship]] of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Herbert Annesley Packer|Sir Herbert Packer]], was refitted in 1955-6 and decommissioned, 18 months later in December 1957. She was approved for disposal 2 years later and arrived at the [[Dalmuir]] yards of Arnott Young on 8 August 1960 to be scrapped.

Although ''Superb'' was the latest of the line of 6-inch gun cruisers to be completed, (the 1943 ''Minotaur'' class followed directly from the [[Crown Colony-class cruiser|1938 Colony]] and [[Town-class cruiser (1936)|1936 Town]] classes), she was also one of the first of this type to be broken up. Plans for her modernisation were abandoned after the 1957 defense review. No more cruiser modernizations were approved, with new guided missile ships to take precedence. Pre-war ships lasted longer, showing the difference between peacetime and wartime building standards.&lt;ref&gt;A. Dobson. 'Twilight of the British Cruiser', in Ships Monthly 23-6, p20-25&lt;/ref&gt;
