==The first image==
The first image on the page is definitely NOT an F-84G (the Edwards AFB page from which it came is in error). The F-84G had a multi-framed canopy -- I can't see the tail number in the photo but it's probably an F-84E. - [[User:Emt147|Emt147]] [[User_talk:Emt147|&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Burninate!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 23:20, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

== Assessment==

I have classified this as B for [[WP:MILHIST]], as this project has it's own independent A-class review. Before submitting it, I would suggest the addition of citations to some sections, especially &quot;development&quot; and 'Korean War&quot;. [[User:Carom|Carom]] 16:04, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for the comments. This is among several articles I'm trying to bring up to FA level. The text is verified but I need to go back and add the actual citations. - [[User:Emt147|Emt147]] [[User_talk:Emt147|&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Burninate!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 03:16, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

== pressed-forged spars and ribs ==

I believe the giant press used to make the spars and ribs for the F-84F's wings was made by the (defunct)Mesta machine tool company, based just outside of Pittsburgh, PA. [[User:152.163.100.131|152.163.100.131]] 09:40, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== Cite tags ==

Just so no-one freaks out - the cite tags were added at the request of an editor during the course of an A-class review. If cites aren't added, the tags can be removed once the review is closed. [[User:Carom|Carom]] 17:22, 29 December 2006 (UTC) They are still excessive and in most cases, unnecessary. [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] 18:05 29 December 2006 (UTC).

== YF-96 redirects here ==

Is there a reason why [[YF-96]] redirects to the F-84 page?  If the YF-96 was a derivative or variant of the F-84, shouldn't that be mentioned in the article? [[User:Nibios|Nibios]] 21:41, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

:The YF-96 was the original designation for the [[F-84F Thunderstreak]]. The F-84F was originally part of this article until a few months ago. I thought I had changed all the relevant redirects, but I missed one! Thanks for catching that. - [[User:BillCJ|BillCJ]] 23:18, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

== Thunderwhat? ==

I can find lines in the body text referring to Thunderjet, Thunderstreak, and Thunderscreech.  I get the impression that different names were given to different models, but it isn't exactly clear which model had which name.  For instance a reference is made to an E model Thunderstreak, but that is immediately followed by a reference to a G model Thunderjet. Would it be a good idea to add a magic decoder ring to the list of variants at the bottom of the article?  Maybe including the model name along with the model number? [[User:Loren.wilton|Loren.wilton]] ([[User talk:Loren.wilton|talk]]) 07:21, 26 January 2008 (UTC)

:The straight-wing F-84A-E and G models were called the Thunderjet. They should be the only models covered here now. The [[F-84F Thunderstreak|F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash]] are the swept-wing versions. The last version is the [[XF-84H Thunderscreech]], an experimental turboprop version of the F-84F. The others models were also covered here until last year. They are listed in the introduction, under the variants (sewpt-wing), and under &quot;Notable achievements&quot; concerning the Thunderbirds. I don't find &quot;Thunderstreak&quot; mentioned outside of those contexts. - [[User:BillCJ|BillCJ]] ([[User talk:BillCJ|talk]]) 08:03, 26 January 2008 (UTC)
