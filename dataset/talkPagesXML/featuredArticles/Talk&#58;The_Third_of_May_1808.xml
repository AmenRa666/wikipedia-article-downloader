==Crucifixtion==
Is there any chance that the peseant's outstreached arms are supposed to recall the crucifixtion? It would seem to make sense, given the martyr-like portrayal and that the painter and his audience were Christian. Anyone know what the art-world concensus on this is? [[User:Snowboardpunk|Snowboardpunk]] 00:44, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

I am in a 100 level ( first year ) Art History class, and we have recently viewed and discussed this painting. My professor made a point to point out the similarities with the man you mentioned and Christ.

I think that the analasys of the meaning of the painting should be changed. I don't see any citations, if you could prove the painter said something about it, you could state it's a fact. If you can't find a source, write it in such a way that it has simmilarities to something. --[[Special:Contributions/82.148.206.88|82.148.206.88]] ([[User talk:82.148.206.88|talk]]) 11:44, 14 January 2008 (UTC)

== a Pleaʃing Area for Diʃcuʃʃion ==

A couple of comments. Nice work everyone.
* I don't see our hero kneeling on a corpse, but the ground is bloody. Right now it says &quot;the brilliantly lit figure of a man kneeling on the corpses of those already executed&quot;?
* &quot;In 1808 Napoleon sought to take advantage of Spanish unrest and an unpopular monarchy by invading Spain, entering through the Pyrenees unopposed, only to meet resistance from civilians in Saragossa.[4] Napoleon’s principal commander was Marshal Joachim Murat, who may well have intended to establish an equitable government in Spain.&quot; I'd rather have a citation for the second sentence than the first, given that the first is basic history and the second suggests intention.

:Both good points. My error regarding the corpse business; he is kneeling amongst, not on them. And I can cite the information on Murat. Thanks, [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 23:46, 7 April 2008 (UTC)
::Done.  On p. 109 Licht writes: ...&quot;Murat doubtless intended to establish a more equitable, efficient, and honorable government in Spain than that which Spain had enjoyed under the Bourbon-Parma monarchy. But the Spanish people, who had accepted abominably inept foreign rulers several times in the past...balked at a benevolent king forced on them by the sober dictates of political exigency.&quot; [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 00:00, 8 April 2008 (UTC)

[[Image:David-Oath of the Horatii-1784.jpg|thumb]]
:: Sounds good. What do you think of this ''Horatii'' connection. It's rather striking when you compare the two.

:::Yes! I grabbed a few books from the library today, and though I have not yet had a chance to read through them, comparisons to David (primarily), and Baron Gros, are substantiated.

==&lt;s&gt;Two&lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt;Three&lt;/s&gt; A few things:==
* ''For its content, presentation, and emotional force, The Third of May is now regarded as a revolutionary work'' - Is it only recently regarded as such? Needs to be clarified.
::Deleted 'now'. [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 03:19, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
:::Not really good enough. When did the painting come into wide view. [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 19:53, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
* ''repeated mechanical movement'' - What does this mean in this instance? 
::Agreed. Not my favorite alliteration. Just now I can't find it, so I trust it has been deleted. If not, feel free to erase. [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 03:32, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
* ''an ironic comment on the French painter [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s'' - Ironic is not developed. [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 22:49, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
**I wonder if comments from Clark and Danto belong under 'Iconography and invention', or are better served by a separate header, say, 'interpretation' or 'assessment'. They don't deal directly with Goya's iconoclasm, but are later commentaries by others. [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 03:19, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
:::Yes, or they could be worked into the legacy section, as Danto is comparing with Manet. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 03:29, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
::::I have reservations about moving the commentary to the Legacy section for the same reason, with its focus on artworks rather than critical commentary.

:A separate section ''Critical commentary'' might work. I wonder if there were any other and/or contemporaneous comments we can find...[[Charles Yriarte]] or even later ones by [[Andre Malraux]].

*''The Third of May is regarded as a revolutionary work'' - Revolutionary has two meanings; but seminal doesn't work either. Any suggestions. [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 11:37, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
:If revolutionary means bringing about ''radical change'' and a if revolutionary work of art or painting means radically changing the art of painting then it's a good word. Goya's painting was revolutionary. [[User:Modernist|Modernist]] ([[User talk:Modernist|talk]]) 12:08, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
::So do we say 'in both sences' [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 12:10, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
:::Why not. Its an accurate and succinct concept. [[User:Modernist|Modernist]] ([[User talk:Modernist|talk]]) 12:13, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
::::Probably not necessary. I've deleted the mention 'in both senses' because the accompanying cite from Clark explains this, calling it ''revolutionary in every sense of the word, in style, in subject, and in intention''. [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 13:28, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
:I don't like it, and I'd bet it will be called during FAC. Revolutionary also means finding guns and what not and killing thoes 'not like us'. I'm not convinced Goya was of this mind; this why he is so resonant. Panently the painting is anti rather than pro 'means vs. ends'. [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 19:36, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
::Actually Goya might well have been aware of revolutionary in that sense of the word also, if Arthur Danto is to be believed then Goya ''was'' thinking about stirring people up against the French, it is a powerful and emotionally charged picture. I'm curious to hear what French critical commentary about the painting is. I read some of Andre Malraux's comments that seemed a little obtuse, and antithetical..maybe I'm wrong about that...I'll try to find them again, hmm from what I found I think I'm probably wrong about Malraux - he seems a great admirer of Goya. [[User:Modernist|Modernist]] ([[User talk:Modernist|talk]]) 22:13, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
:::When initially choosing the word 'revolutionary', I did so only to describe the import of the work, and then only after finding several refs (Licht and Clark) that supported use of the term. Given the work's break with tradition, as detailed in the article, it ought not be a controversial word, but if there is indeed a problem, it can be rephrased (e.g., ''innovative'' is a possible synonym). The article is just getting more solid, with much great work. [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 23:42, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
::::I like &quot;revolutionary&quot;, which Webster's defines as &quot;of, having the nature of, characterized by, tending toward, or causing a revolution, or drastic change, especially in a government or social system&quot;. Goya's painting was certainly characterized by a drastic change—in the manner of painting massacres, if nothing else, so the word choice is defensible. &quot;Innovative&quot; sounds like a better mousetrap, and there aren't a lot of other alternatives--&quot;radical&quot;, perhaps (although that word has problematical connotations). The article is looking very, very good. [[User:Ewulp|Ewulp]] ([[User talk:Ewulp|talk]]) 00:21, 13 April 2008 (UTC)
::::In a pinch, &quot;innovative&quot; could be helped with &quot;powerfully&quot; or &quot;drastically&quot;--but you gotta like the punchiness of &quot;revolutionary&quot;. [[User:Ewulp|Ewulp]] ([[User talk:Ewulp|talk]]) 01:00, 13 April 2008 (UTC)

* &quot;Art critic Arthur Danto has drawn a comparison between Goya's The Third of May and Manet's several versions of his Execution of the Emperor Maximilian:...{quote}&quot; I'm not seeing a comparison in the quote that follows. It seems mostly to rehash what the article has already said. I think only the last couple of sentences, as a quote, are relevant. –[[User:Outriggr|&lt;font color=&quot;#112299&quot;&gt;Outriggr]]&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Outriggr|''§'']] 06:33, 13 April 2008 (UTC)
::The Danto ref links to his entire comparison between Manet and Goya. The quote in the article is Danto on ''The Third of May'' the entire comparison is much longer and detailed - mostly about Manet. What is in the article is what Danto said about the Goya with basic historical context. I think his remarks about the occupation, the French, Mexico, etc. are helpful for understanding the last two sentences; alone they are too misleading. I still like revolutionary by the way...[[User:Modernist|Modernist]] ([[User talk:Modernist|talk]]) 11:17, 13 April 2008 (UTC)

== [[mamaluke]] ==

Are the soldiers here, as opposed to May 2, actually [[Mamluk#Mamluks_in_the_service_of_Napoleon|Mamluk]]s? Their uniforms are standard European ones, &amp; it seems unlikely to me they are intended to represent Mamluks, regardless of any role they may have had in the historical events. Note, from the article:
&quot;During their service in Napoleon’s army, the Mamluk squadron wore the following uniform: 

Before 1804: The only &quot;uniform&quot; part was the green cahouk (hat), white turban, and red saroual (pants), all to be worn with a loose shirt and a vest. Boots were of yellow, red, or tan soft leather. Weapons consisted of an &quot;Oriental&quot; [[scimitar]], a brace of pistols in a holder decorated with a [[brass]] crescent and star, and a dagger.&quot; 

[[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 22:58, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

*The executioners in The Third of May, do look like regular official French soldiers, (they remind me of the soldiers in one of my favorite movies - directed by [[Wojciech Has]], ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript]],'' [[1965 in film|1965]], although the action takes place a little earlier than 1800. I think of the film whenever I look at the Goya). Maybe the Mamluks had an extra uniform, these guys seem to be regulars though.

&quot;Iconography and invention&quot;, and the legacy section have cross over thoughts that needs to be resolved. The lead is weak and inchorent sill. A few image captions are still stubby, and a few other treads at various points are disjointed, and have logic jumps. [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 23:42, 15 April 2008 (UTC)

==Points==
[[Image:Goya Christ.jpg|thumb]]
*The painting is nearly 4 metres wide; I have removed references to its &quot;small and intimate scale&quot;. 

*&quot;Description
The painting is set at night, and centers on two masses of men; one a rigidly poised firing squad, the other a disorganized group of captives forced at gun point against a wall....&quot;
- is it a wall?  Most writers seem to think it is the hill, although looked at hard it seems to be some object in betweeen the two. 

*I have re-written the martyr bit in terms of Ribera, more to the point than Tiepolo, and whose many martyrdoms now in the Prado Goya would have known.  I hope this is still compatible with the Licht reference.  I'm beginning to have my doubts about Licht.

* &quot;In The Third of May, the man with raised hands at the focal point of the composition uses the iconography of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, and shows stigmata-like marks on his right hand...&quot; - or is he being crucified, as we say shortly after. There is a Goya Gethsemine painting (of 1819) which is similar, with outstretched arms, but these are not I think common in depictions of the scene. (see pic - worth including?)
::That Gethsemane comparison really does seem off--the classic Gethsemane pose is arms down more or less, or crossed; never high over the head.  [[User:Ewulp|Ewulp]] ([[User talk:Ewulp|talk]]) 02:53, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

:::Well [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Christ_on_the_Mount_of_Olives the commons cat] has one or two but they aren't typical. Hands clasped in prayer is commonest. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 03:16, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

Please amend to reflect your valid point. I was using this passage from Licht as ref: 
:''Not only is the figure seen in a position that has become the canonical attitude of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, but his right hand bears unmistakable signs of the stigmata''. &lt;s&gt;By the way, I still prefer ''revolutionary''.&lt;/s&gt; I need to reread the entire article, which I have not done lately.

::After JNW took it out, I have re-added a combined version. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 09:25, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
* Caption: &quot;The realism of [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s ''Massacre of the Innocents'' c.1611, was a direct influence on Goya when he painted the Príncipe Pío canvases.&quot;  I think the painting turned up in the last decade in an Austrian monastery, and was probably once in the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Princes of Lichtenstein's]] collection. How could Goya ever have seen it?  I don't believe there were prints of it. Same problem in the text.
:* [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s ''Massacre of the Innocents'' c.1636-38, though was possibly seen by Goya who was an admirer.

*According to a 2003 UK Guardian article ''The Unflinching Eye'' about Goya by Robert Hughes it took forty years for the the painting to be seen by the public, remaining in storage until then.

::I think we are covered there - Gautier saw it in 1845, presumably on a normal visit as a punter, so 40 yrs seems too long.

==Lead==
I've perpetrated minor copy edits to lead, including removal of the technical finesse reference (not important enough for lead) and the claim that the painting has been considered one of the first works of the modern era since the mid-19th century--please reinstate this if there is a ref, but the ref I found &lt;s&gt;(I don't think it was Licht, either; in all the copy editing sometimes refs get misplaced)&lt;/s&gt; only stated that the work was seen and began to be appreciated by the mid- 1800s. I am uncertain of the time of its high critical ascendancy, which took eloquent form from the pens of Clark, Licht, et al. [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 23:37, 18 April 2008 (UTC)
:Your perpetration is fine JNW; note my edit summary when I added thoes bits. [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 05:59, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
::The tie in with Rubens's massacar is interesting but underdeveloped. Anyone like to clarify this. [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 06:10, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
:::See above - I toned it down a bit because there is a question as to which of Rubens' many massacres would have been known to Goya. I looked up all the Prado Rubenses, and actually, apart from harrassment of nymphs, they are a much more peaceable bunch than, say, the London ones.  But he may have known others in aristocratic collections, or from prints, copies or imitations, as Clark's comment suggests (though I'm not entirely sure Clark can be relied on to have checked this was the case). [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 09:18, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
:Given both Clark and Huxley's comments about Goya and Rubens it seems clear that a connection between Goya's series of etchings and paintings of war with Rubens' paintings and prints of war, seems to make sense. The composition of ''the second'' is very similar to the Rubens, while the composition of ''the third'' demonstrates Goya's willingness to follow his own genius.

:It doesn't need to stay. Initially I included the image to underscore this sentence and ref from Licht: 
:''But such depictions were artfully fashioned, the mastery of composition and painting in works such as those by Tiepolo serving to correlate to the harmony with God achieved through Christian martyrdom.[17] '' 
:I believe it has since been removed, and with it, the rationale for the image. [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 14:51, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
::I re-targeted the text reference to Ribera, as being at the rougher end of traditional martyrdoms, rather than the elegant Tiepolo, but I think the Tiepolo pic, with the caption, still works to make the point.

==To do==
Two things:
* The statement ''Kenneth Clark felt the Second of May an &quot;artistic failure ... '' contradicts the several quotes from him earlier in the article. Also the statement is a fragment and unclear in its present state.
* The fact that this work is a break from traditional depections of war scenes is touched upon in a few sections, but lightly and makes the article disjointed. Seperate section? [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 22:31, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
:Ceoil: I confess that though I have noticed a great deal of good work, I have not ''really'' read the article through for some days. However... 
:*1. The Clark is about the ''Second of May'', and is included to tie in with Rubens' influence. The passage that exists uneasily there is the one sentence claiming a possible influence from Rubens, with the second asserting it as definite...sounds like two contributors having a conversation. 
:::Eek, my mistake JNW. I'm going green eyed from reading the same prose over and over. I think we need more on ''The Second'' however, and is their a collective name for the two? [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 23:14, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
::::Perfectly understandable. I don't know that there's a collective title, other than ''The Second and Third of May''...[[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 23:24, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
:::::The collective name is on the tip of my toungh, but I can find it. Its the Spanish name of the hill where the 3rd is set. O'Connell uses it, but Im too lazy and well fed to bend over and opick up the book, [[User:Ceoil|Ceoil]] ([[User talk:Ceoil|talk]]) 23:53, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
:::::::No, I think you are misreading Connell (p.159) there (or he is wrong). The 2nd is set on [[Puerta del Sol]], the Times Square of Madrid.

::Follow-up on Rubens: I've tried to make the aforementioned passages on Rubens' influence less bumpy, and less definite on the claim of influence, as well. Goya did not title any of the Black paintings, and the Saturn title was given after his death. It does resemble the Rubens, but might there not have been other similar works as well, including various versions of Ugolino? And as someone (probably Licht) has noted, the unfortunate 'child' in Goya's painting does not even have a child's anatomy. In all, I'm not certain that the matter of influence is conclusive. I will see if I can find something that sheds more light. Refs, anyone? [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 23:01, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
:::Further, and this is good stuff: Licht notes that Goya ''would'' have been familiar with the Rubens Saturn, which was then already in Spain's royal collection. He also speculates that other influences might have been relevant, including the then widespread superstition, illustrated in  print, paint, and sculpture, that Jews needed the blood of Christian infants to make Passover bread. Sigh. Eventually, that's material for the article on Goya's Saturn. [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 23:22, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
::Yeah, and Passover was tonight... The 1796-97 drawing by Goya actually looks more like the Rubens painting - of Saturn biting, then Goya's own later painting. [http://eeweems.com/goya/saturn.html] [[User:Modernist|Modernist]] ([[User talk:Modernist|talk]]) 04:12, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

== Guidol ==

Minor point: There are two books by Guidol in the bibliography (assuming they are in fact different), but only 1 ref, which does not give a distinguishing date.  Both have been added this month. The ref is no 46, for:
&quot;The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself is characteristic of that which Goya would employ in many of his later works; a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish.[46]&quot;

[[Image:Execution of maximillian mejia miramon.png|left|thumb|Print of the ''Execution of Maximilian'', artist unknown, first published in [[Harper's Weekly]] on August 10, 1867.]]
Is it true, and is there a source for the claim, that the anonymous print of the execution of Maximilian I is &quot;clearly influenced&quot; by Goya? Someone is bound to object to this as OR, and I'm a little skeptical myself. The image could plausibly have been drawn by someone with no knowledge of Goya, but who had witnessed one or more executions by firing squad, or was working from a photograph (of any such execution, not Maximilian's). [[User:Ewulp|Ewulp]] ([[User talk:Ewulp|talk]]) 20:35, 3 May 2008 (UTC)
:Good point. An anonymous print, without ref, that given its similarities, may or may not owe its composition to the Goya. Also, it's not of the same quality as the other works pictured here. [[User:JNW|JNW]] ([[User talk:JNW|talk]]) 22:19, 3 May 2008 (UTC)
::My impression of the print is it's either influenced by or influenced on Manet, with little thought of Goya. The execution took place in June, and the print was published in August.

:::I don't see how an artist in New York could have been aware of the first Manet (we illustrate the last one) so quickly.  Look at the Moma [http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/2006/Manet/timeline.htm timeline], which incidentally does not support what the article references to it about a Manet on the subject being in the 1867 Salon -it says they were first exhibited in the US in 1879. A look at the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Firing_squad commons category] shows there are only so many ways to depict, or photograph, a firing squad, and I would be doubtful if the Harpers print relates to either Goya or Manet in either direction. What commons does bring out is the originality, and perhaps the artifice, of the forward-lunging stance of Goya's soldiers - or perhaps their muskets had a bigger recoil.

:The MoMA timeline does seem to help understand a few questions - it looks like it was likely the 1869 Salon that Manet might have submitted the painting, (although he was warned, and it was a very politically incorrect picture especially if you were the French government) rather than the 1867 Salon, which seemed to me to be too soon. The NY print might have influenced Manet, but visa versa seems unlikely. Manet did begin the series in 1867 but with the more violent and less artful, but most painterly version.

== The influence of Goya's deafness ==

At the end of the article Kenneth Clark is quoted as once having seen ''The Third of May'' as &quot;a kind of superior journalism.... I was mistaken.&quot; In explaining why he was mistaken, he makes the point that Goya's deafness influenced how he absorbed information, and communicated it back. &quot;And this power of concentrating his whole physical being on a split second of vision was developed by an accident [his illness].... Gesture and facial expression, when they are seen without the accompanying sound, become unnaturally vivid.... The crowds in the Puerto del Sol were silent to him; he could not have heard the firing squads on the third of May. Every experience reached him through the eye alone.&quot; ([http://www.artchive.com/artchive/G/goya/may_3rd.jpg.html Excerpt] from ''Looking at Pictures.'') 

Should a reminder of Goya's deafness be included, somewhere in &quot;Iconography and invention&quot;?

== Rubens ==

From &quot;Points&quot; above:
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens Massacre of the Innocents.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peter Paul Rubens]]' works, such as this ''[[Massacre of the Innocents (Rubens)|Massacre of the Innocents]]'' c.&amp;nbsp;1611, probably influenced Goya.&lt;ref name=&quot;rubens&quot;&gt;Clark, p.&amp;nbsp;127.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
{{quote|* Caption: &quot;The realism of [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s ''Massacre of the Innocents'' c.1611, was a direct influence on Goya when he painted the Príncipe Pío canvases.&quot;  I think the painting turned up in the last decade in an Austrian monastery, and was probably once in the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Princes of Lichtenstein's]] collection. How could Goya ever have seen it?  I don't believe there were prints of it. Same problem in the text.
:* [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s ''Massacre of the Innocents'' c.1636-38, though was possibly seen by Goya who was an admirer. The second painting was painted by Rubens from what I read partly because the other one just wasn't easily available to be seen.

::All these years and the while the fact-checkers are still putting their boots on the first and most dubious illustration remains here and has propagated into other WPs. Even the second seems dubious: Goya didn't go to Munich, and I doubt the painting traveled to Spain, so he would have to have seen an engraving. More to the point, the reference makes it look like Kenneth Clark says something he doesn't. I found the book and his only mention of Rubens is in the quote about 2nd of May referring to &quot;similar pictures by Rubens&quot;.

Changed to [[:File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg]], because original doesn't have FP quality. Maybe it can be the picture of the day on 3  May. [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 19:07, 6 March 2015 (UTC)

== Engvar ==

Following a recent edit, the original language style does seem to be British English - in the first edits in 2006 Sparkit used &quot;metre&quot;. I've templated accordingly. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 16:13, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
... which I see Ewulp has reverted! We'd better discuss. As I've explained the article began in British English. Was a change ever discussed, and is there any reason for one? see [[WP:ENGVAR]] for those new to such discussions. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 11:09, 25 August 2015 (UTC)

:I thought the recent Engvar change by an IP violated [[MOS:RETAIN]]: &quot;When an English variety's consistent usage has been established in an article, maintain it in the absence of consensus to the contrary ... When no English variety has been established and discussion cannot resolve the issue, the variety used in the first non-stub revision is considered the default.&quot; Consistent usage has been established in this article. When the article began as a 246-byte stub on Feb. 3, 2006, Engvar was indeterminate. On March 2, 2006, Sparkit enlarged it to a 805-byte stub that included &quot;metre&quot;; three edits later on April 11 an IP changed it to &quot;meter&quot;. Sparkit edited again but did not revert this. The stub was expanded by JNW on April 5, 2008 with US spellings, and it was worked on by many before being promoted to FA with US spellings a few weeks later. I think seven years of consistent usage in a stable FA meets the definition of &quot;established&quot; if anything does, and the priority MOS:RETAIN gives to &quot;the first non-stub revision&quot; suggests that the brief existence of a single word in a tiny stub should not be grounds for overturning the established version.
