'''USS ''Keokuk'' (AN-5/CM-8/CMc-6/AKN-4)''' was a  [[minelayer|mine]] and [[net laying ship]] of the [[United States Navy]] during World War II.

Laid down in 1914 as the {{SS|Henry M. Flagler}} by [[William Cramp &amp; Sons]], [[Philadelphia]], and renamed {{SS|Columbia Heights}} in 1940, she was acquired by the U.S. Navy on 28 July 1941 for conversion to a Coastal Minelayer, CMc-6. Reclassified as a Net Layer, AN-5, and named USS ''Keokuk'' on 15 August 1941, she was commissioned on 28 February 1942. Reclassified as a Minelayer, CM-8, on 18 May 1942, and again as a Net Cargo Ship, AKN-4, in November 1943.

==Service history==

=== Atlantic Coast operations ===
''Keokuk'' cleared [[Delaware Bay]] on 7 March 1942 and arrived [[Norfolk, Virginia]], the same day to commence service as a net layer. She operated out of Norfolk and [[Key West, Florida]], for two months before she was reclassified as Minelayer CM-8 on 18 May 1942. Based at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], mine depot that summer, ''Keokuk'' engaged in high priority mine laying along the Atlantic coast.

=== World War II North Africa operations ===
As the war in Europe intensified, the mine layer made preparations for service in the [[Mediterranean]]. Departing [[Brooklyn, New York]] on 13 November, ''Keokuk'' crossed the [[submarine]]-infested Atlantic and arrived at [[Casablanca]] on 1 December. She remained in [[North Africa]]n waters for seven weeks laying mines off the harbor of Casablanca. She sailed on 20 January 1943 with [[convoy]] GUS-8, arriving [[New York City|New York]] on 7 February. Following repairs at [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], ''Keokuk'' sailed on 1 March to commence net-laying exercises out of [[Melville, Rhode Island]].

=== Invasion of Sicily ===
During April and May, the minelayer operated with the mine warfare school at Yorktown, Virginia; then sailed to Brooklyn, New York, to join a convoy bound for [[Algeria]]. ''Keokuk'' departed [[Brooklyn]] on 13 June, arriving [[Oran]], Algeria, 4 July. Two days later she steamed toward [[Gela]], [[Sicily]], to lay [[antisubmarine]] minefields prior to the landing there. During these operations, on 11 July, ''Keokuk'' was attacked by six enemy planes; but [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] drove the raiders off. After the successful conclusion of the Sicilian campaign, she operated out of Algeria until sailing for Norfolk, Virginia, 7 October.

=== World War II Pacific Theatre operations ===
Upon completion of a short overhaul, ''Keokuk'' was converted to a net layer and, reclassified AKN-4, departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 23 November for the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. She arrived at [[Tarawa]] on 3 February 1944 after a month's stay at [[Pearl Harbor]], and immediately commenced net laying operations in the [[Marshall Islands]]. She continued this service until 12 April when she cleared [[Eniwetok]] to load new net at [[San Francisco, California]]. ''Keokuk'' returned to Kwajalein on 9 June, and departed two days later to engage in the [[Battle of Saipan|amphibious assault on Saipan]]. She arrived in Saipan waters on 19 June and began laying antisubmarine net off [[Tanapag]] Harbor.

Following the Saipan campaign the net-cargo ship operated out of Eniwetok until 17 July when she once again sailed for San Francisco, California. Upon her return to [[Guadalcanal]] on 1 September, ''Keokuk'' readied herself for the assault on [[Peleliu]] which was needed as a base for the subsequent invasion in the [[Philippines]]. She arrived off [[Kossol Passage]] on 17 September and continued net laying operations for a month before arriving at [[Manus Island|Manus]] on 17 October. The next day ''Keokuk'' sailed for San Francisco, California, to undergo repair and overhaul.

The net-cargo ship returned to Eniwetok on 6 February 1945 as the war was approaching its climax. ''Keokuk'' departed [[Guam]] on 16 February, bound for the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-held volcano fortress, [[Iwo Jima]]. She commenced net laying operations four days later, as she played her key role in this courageous undertaking.

=== Struck by a kamikaze ===
On 21 February just prior to sunset while cruising in formation with a group of [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]]s, an enemy [[Nakajima B6N|&quot;Jill&quot;]] dived out of the clouds and hit ''Keokuk'' on the [[starboard]] side, knocking out most of the starboard 20&amp;nbsp;mm battery. The fires were extinguished by 18:50; the ship had 17 killed and 44 wounded in the action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usskeokuk.googlepages.com/damageatiwojima Damage at Iwo Jima]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion of repairs at [[Leyte]], the net-cargo ship sailed on 19 March toward the last great hurdle - [[Okinawa]]. ''Keokuk'' arrived off [[Kerama Retto]] on 26 March to lay antisubmarine nets prior to the invasion. With the invasion well under way, she cleared the battle area 4 April, arriving Saipan 10 April. Then after a two-month overhaul at Pearl Harbor, ''Keokuk'' returned to Eniwetok on 2 July to unload net material. As the war entered its final month she sailed from [[Ulithi]] on 25 July, and, after a stop at Pearl Harbor, arrived San Francisco, California, 10 September.

The veteran ship remained there until she decommissioned on 5 December 1945 at San Francisco, California. She was transferred to the [[War Shipping Administration]] on 1 July 1946 for disposal; and sold on 7 March 1947 to the [[West India Fruit and Steamship Company]] of [[Florida]].

''Keokuk'' received five [[battle star]]s for [[World War II]] service.
