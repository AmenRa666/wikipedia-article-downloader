Master Commandant '''William Henry Allen''' (21 October 1784 - 18 August 1813) was an [[United States|American]] naval officer during the [[War of 1812]].

==Early life==
Allen was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and was appointed a [[midshipman]] in the [[United States Navy]] on 28 April 1800. Between 1800 and 1807, he served successively in [[USS George Washington (1798)|''George Washington'']]&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Marquis Who's Who, Inc. ''Who Was Who in American History, the Military''. Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1975. P. 8  ISBN 0837932017 {{OCLC|657162692}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[USS Philadelphia (1799)|''Philadelphia'']]. On 17 February 1807, he was promoted to lieutenant and was transferred to [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|''Chesapeake'']].

On 21 June 1807, he participated in the [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair]] in which the ''Chesapeake'' was boarded by the British and four sailor were taken captive on suspicion of being deserters from the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;   Allen was credited with firing the only gun discharged in her own defense by the American ship.  The incident was a key development in building American resentment toward the British which eventually resulted in the [[War of 1812]].

==War of 1812==
By 1812, Allen was first lieutenant of the frigate [[USS United States (1797)|''United States'']], under the command of Captain [[Stephen Decatur]], and took part in the engagement with [[HMS Macedonian|HMS ''Macedonian'']]. At the conclusion of that capture, he was named to command the prize crew which took ''Macedonian'' into [[New York, New York|New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

On 24 July 1813, he was promoted to [[master commandant]] (equivalent to the modern day Navy rank of commander) and took command of the brig [[USS Argus (1803)|''Argus'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; On 14 August, he led his ship in the [[Capture of USS Argus|engagement with HMS ''Pelican'']] during which he received mortal wounds. A round shot cut off his right leg, but he remained at his station until he fainted from blood loss. After ''Argus''' surrender, Allen was taken to the hospital at [[Plymouth]]'s Millbay Prison where he died on 18 August 1813.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

Master Commandant Allen was buried with full military honors in the churchyard of [[St Andrew's, Plymouth]], England.&lt;ref&gt;'''Roosevelt, Theodore: ''The Naval War of 1812'''''; G. P. Putnam's Sons [1882] Naval Institute Press [1987]:&lt;br/&gt;ISBN 0-87021-445-4: pp. 125–126; 198-200; 203; 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1814 a small row galley was named the [[USS Allen (1814)|USS ''Allen'']] in his honor.

The destroyer [[USS Allen (DD-66)|USS ''Allen'' (DD-66)]] was also named after him.  The ''Allen'' served during [[World War I]] and was present at [[Pearl Harbor]] during the attack on 7 December 1941.  The ''Allen'' was the oldest destroyer in the Navy during [[World War II]].  She was assigned to training duties and spent the remainder of the war at Pearl Harbor.  After the war, she was decommissioned and sold for scrap.

* It is possible that Allens Avenue in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] was named after him.

==Family==
His father, [[William Allen (Continental Army)|William Allen]], soon after the start of the [[American Revolution]] in June 1775, was commissioned an ensign in the [[3rd Rhode Island Regiment]] in the Continental Army.   His regiment served in the [[Siege of Boston]] and was disbanded on December 31, 1775.  In January 1776, he was promoted to 1st lieutenant in the [[2nd Rhode Island Regiment|11th Continental Infantry Regiment]] and served until the regiment was disbanded at the end of the year.  In January 1777 he was promoted to captain in the [[2nd Rhode Island Regiment]].  He commanded a company of the Rhode Island line of troops at the [[Battle of Saratoga]].  He transferred to the [[1st Rhode Island Regiment]] when the two Rhode Island regiments were consolidated on January 1, 1781.  William Allen was present and actively engaged in many of the battles which were fought during our Revolutionary War.  In recognition of his service, he was advanced to the brevet (honorary) rank of major on September 30, 1783.  He served until the Continental Army was disbanded on November 3, 1783.  In 1786, Allen was appointed by [[United States Congress|Congress]], senior officer of the legionary corps raised in [[Rhode Island]]. In the year 1799, he was appointed by the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]] a [[brigadier general]] of militia.

The mother of William Henry Allen, was the sister of [[William Jones (governor)|William Jones]], who served as Governor of Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, John, LL.D., &quot;The Pictorial Book Of The Commodores; Comprising Lives Of Distinguished Commanders In The Navy Of The United States.&quot; Nafis &amp; Cornish, New York, 1845. p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;
