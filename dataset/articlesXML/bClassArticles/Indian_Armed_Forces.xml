==History==
{{Main article|Military history of India}}
India has one of the longest military histories, dating back several millennia. The first reference of armies is found in the [[Vedas]] as well as the epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabaratha]]. Classical Indian texts on archery in particular, and [[Indian martial arts|martial arts]] in general are known as [[Dhanurveda]].

===Ancient to medieval era===
[[Indian maritime history]] dates back 5,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/myindia/facts.php Interesting facts about India] and [http://pubweb.cc.u-tokai.ac.jp/indus/english/2_5_01.html Maritime trade with the west]&lt;/ref&gt; The first tidal dock is believed to have been built at [[Lothal]] around 2300 BC during the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], near the present day [[Mangrol]] harbour on the Gujarat coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1345150.stm|title=BBC News - SOUTH ASIA - Indian seabed hides ancient remains|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rig Veda]] written around 1500 BC, credits Varuna with knowledge of the ocean routes and describes naval expeditions. There is reference to the side wings of a vessel called Plava, which give stability to the ship under storm conditions. A compass, Matsya yantra was used for navigation in the fourth and fifth century AD. The earliest known reference to an organisation devoted to ships in ancient India is to the [[Mauryan Empire]] from the 4th century BC. Powerful militaries included those of the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]], [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]], [[Chola Empire|Chola]], [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] [[empire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiannavy.nic.in/history.htm History of the Indian Navy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310000000/http://indiannavy.nic.in/history.htm |date=10 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]]'s mentor and advisor [[Chanakya]]'s [[Arthashastra]] devotes a full chapter on the state department of waterways under ''navadhyaksha'' ([[Sanskrit]] for [[Management|Superintendent]] of ships) {{Ref|Kautilya}}. The term, ''nava dvipantaragamanam'' (Sanskrit for sailing to other lands by ships, i.e. Exploration) appears in this book in addition to appearing in the Buddhist text, ''Baudhayana Dharmasastra'' as the interpretation of the term, ''Samudrasamyanam''.

Sea lanes between India and neighbouring lands were the usual form of trade for many centuries, and are responsible for the widespread influence of Indian Culture on other societies. The [[Chola]]s excelled in foreign trade and maritime activity, extending their influence overseas to China and Southeast Asia. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Maratha and Kerala fleets were expanded, and became the most powerful Naval Forces in the subcontinent, defeating European Navies at various times (''See the [[Battle of Colachel]]''). The fleet review of the Maratha navy took place at the Ratnagiri fort in which the ships Pal and Qalbat participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/dakshina_kan_pa/art24/feb.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027173614/http://geocities.com/dakshina_kan_pa/art24/feb.htm|title=DKPA : Stamp Calendar - Stamps Issued by India in February 2001|archivedate=27 October 2009|work=geocities.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Maratha]] [[Kanhoji Angre]] and [[Kunjali Marakkar]], the Naval chief of [[Saamoothiri]] were two notable naval chiefs of the period.

===British India (1857 to 1947)===
{{Main article|Royal Indian Navy|British Indian Army|Presidency armies}}
[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA17069.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Humber armoured cars of 10th Indian Division move forward in Italy, 22 July 1944.]]
The Royal Indian Navy was first established by the British while much of India was under the control of the [[East India Company]]. The first Indian to be granted a commission was Sub Lieutenant D. N. Mukherji, who joined the Royal Indian Marine as an engineer officer in 1928.

The Indian Army during [[World War I]] contributed a number of divisions and independent brigades to the European, Mediterranean and the Middle East theatres of war. One million Indian troops would serve overseas, of whom 62,000 died and another 67,000 were wounded. In total 74,187 Indian soldiers died during the war. In World War I, the Indian Army fought against the German Empire in German East Africa and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Indian divisions were also sent to Egypt, [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] and nearly 700,000 served in Mesopotamia against the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In [[World War II]], the Indian Army began the war, in 1939, numbering just under 200,000 men. By the end of the war it had become the largest volunteer army in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in August 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colonies, Colonials and World War Two|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/colonies_colonials_01.shtml|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Serving in divisions of infantry, armour and a fledgling airborne force, they fought on three continents in Africa, Europe and Asia. The Indian Army fought in Ethiopia against the Italian Army, in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia against both the Italian and German Army, and, after the Italian surrender, against the German Army in Italy. However, the bulk of the Indian Army was committed to fighting the Japanese Army, first during the British defeats in Malaya and the retreat from Burma to the Indian border; later, after resting and refitting for the victorious advance back into Burma, as part of the largest British Empire army ever formed. These campaigns cost the lives of over 36,000 Indian servicemen, while another 34,354 were wounded, and 67,340 became prisoners of war. Their valour was recognised with the award of some 4,000 decorations, and 38 members of the Indian Army were awarded the Victoria Cross or the George Cross.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; In 1946, sailors of the [[Royal Indian Navy Mutiny|Royal Indian Navy mutinied]] on board ships and in shore establishments. A total of 78 ships, 20 shore establishments and 20,000 sailors were involved in the rebellion, which had an impact across India.

===Dominion of India (1947–1950)===
The period immediately following Indian independence was a traumatic time for India and her armed services, as along with the newly independent India, the Indian Armed Forces were forcibly divided between India and Pakistan, with ships, divisions and aircraft allocated to the respective Dominions. During this period, the armed forces of India were involved in a number of significant military operations, notably the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]] and ''[[Operation Polo]]'', the code name of a military operation in September 1948 in which the Indian Armed Forces invaded the State of Hyderabad and overthrew its Nizam, annexing the state into the Indian Union. On 15 January 1949, General [[K M Cariappa]] was appointed the first Indian Commander-in-Chief of the India army. On 26 January 1950, India became a republic and all &quot;Royal&quot; designations and affiliations were dropped.

===Republic of India (1950 to present)===
{{main article|Military operations of India}}
While India had become a republic, British officers seconded from the [[British Armed Forces]] continued to hold senior positions in the Indian Armed Forces into the early 1960s. On 1 April 1954, [[Air Marshal]] [[Subroto Mukherjee]] became the first Indian Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Air Force. Effective from 1 April 1955, a Parliamentary Act, the ''Commanders-In-Chiefs (Change in Designation) Act'', re-designated the office of Commander-in-Chief as the Chief of Staff of each respective branch. Not until 1958 would the last British chief of staff, that of the Indian Navy, be succeeded by an Indian; on 22 April of that year, Vice Admiral [[Ram Dass Katari]] became the first Indian Chief of Naval Staff. The Chiefs of Staff of the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy were upgraded to four-star rank on par with the Chief of Army Staff in 1966 and 1968, respectively.

In 1961 tension rose between India and Portugal over the Portuguese-occupied territory of Goa, which India claimed for itself. After Portuguese police cracked down violently on a peaceful, unarmed demonstration for union with India, the Indian government decided to invade and [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]] was initiated. A lopsided air, sea, and ground campaign resulted in the speedy surrender of Portuguese forces. Within 36 hours, 451 years of Portuguese colonial rule was ended, and Goa was annexed by India.

India fought [[India Pakistan wars and conflicts|four major wars]] with its neighbour [[Pakistan]] in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and [[Kargil War|1999]], and with [[China]] in [[Sino-Indian War|1962]]. Indian victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war, helped create the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|free country of Bangladesh]]. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Pakistan began organising tourist expeditions the Siachen Glacier, disputed territory with India. Irked by this development, in April 1984 India initiated successful [[Operation Meghdoot|Operation ''Meghdoot'']] during which it gained control over all of the [[Siachen Glacier]]. [[India]] has established control over all of the {{convert|70|km|mi}} long Siachen Glacier and all of its tributary glaciers, as well as the three main passes of the [[Saltoro Mountains|Saltoro Ridge]] immediately west of the glacier—[[Sia La]], [[Bilafond La]], and [[Gyong La]].&lt;ref name=Wirsing&gt;{{cite book  |last = Wirsing  |first = Robert  |title = Pakistan's security under Zia, 1977–1988: the policy imperatives of a peripheral Asian state  |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan, 1991  |isbn = 9780312060671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Child&gt;{{cite book  |last = Child  |first = Greg  |title = Thin air: encounters in the Himalayas  |publisher = The Mountaineers Books, 1998  |isbn = 9780898865882}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TIME magazine|''TIME'' magazine]], India gained more than {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} of territory because of its military operations in Siachen.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958254-2,00.html | publisher=Time.com | title=The Himalayas War at the Top Of the World | date=31 July 1989 | first=Edward W. | last=Desmond/Kashmir}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pakistan tried in 1987 and in 1989 to re-take the glacier but was unsuccessful.

The [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) carried out a mission in northern and eastern Sri Lanka in 1987–1990 to disarm the [[LTTE|Tamil Tigers]] per the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord.&lt;ref name=iclq&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0020589300047734 M.

After losing approximately 1,200 in personnel and several T-72 tanks, India ultimately abandoned the mission in consultation with Sri Lankan government. In what was labelled as [[Operation Pawan]], the Indian Air Force flew about 70,000 sorties to and within Sri Lanka.

The beginning of the 21st century saw reorientation for India in the global stage from a regional role in the subcontinent to a major role in the Indian ocean region stretching from Gulf of Aden to the [[Malacca Strait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1111004/jsp/nation/story_14586060.jsp|title=Military to expand strategic footprint Rejig to guard India interests|work=telegraphindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's sphere of influence needs to encompass not just the South Asian Sub-continent, but also the northern Indian Ocean area, from the eastern seaboard of Africa in the west, to the Malacca Straits in the east, and must include Iran, Afghanistan, the Central Asian Republics (CARs), China and Myanmar. India's credibility, as a regional power will be contingent upon institutional stability, economic development and military strength, including nuclear deterrence. The long stretches of disputed borders with China and Pakistan and sizeable areas under their occupation continue to be major irritants, notwithstanding the peace processes under-way with both countries.

===Recruitment and Training===
{{Main article|Military academies in India}}

[[File:Sudan Block NDA.JPG|thumb|left|The [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy]] (NDA) at [[Pune]]. NDA serves as the joint services academy for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.]]

The Indian Armed Forces have set up numerous military academies across India for training its personnel. Military schools, [[Sainik School]]s, and the Rashtriya Indian Military College were founded to broaden the recruitment base of the Defence Forces. The three branches of the Indian Armed Forces jointly operate several institutions such as the [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy]] (NDA), [[Defence Services Staff College]] (DSSC), [[National Defence College, India|National Defence College]] (NDC) and the [[College of Defence Management]] (CDM) for training its officers. The [[Armed Forces Medical College, Pune|Armed Forces Medical College]] (AFMC) at [[Pune, Maharashtra|Pune]] is responsible for providing the entire pool of medical staff to the Armed Forces by giving them in service training.
Officer recruitment is through many military-related academies. Besides the tri-service [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy, Pune]], the three services have their own training institutes for this purpose. These include the [[Indian Military Academy]], [[Dehradun]], [[Indian Naval Academy]], [[Ezhimala]], [[Air Force Academy, Dundigul|Air Force Academy]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Officers Training Academy]] at [[Chennai]] and [[Gaya, India|Gaya]].&lt;ref name=yn6j&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaya Officers Training Academy poised to conduct maiden passing out parade|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/gaya-officers-training-academy-poised-conduct-maiden-passing-071715440.html|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=Yahoo News|date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toi10f&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaya to get Army's second Officers Training Academy|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-02-18/india/28144782_1_ssc-officers-navy-and-iaf-officers-training-academy|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable institutions are [[Army War College, Mhow|Army War College]], at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS), at Gulmarg, Jammu and Kashmir,  [[Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJW), in Vairengte, Mizoram, [[College of Military Engineering, Pune|College of Military Engineering]] (CME), in Pune. After being commissioned, these officers are posted and deputed. They are at the helm of affairs not only inside the nation but also at abroad. The officers are appointed and removed only by the [[President of India]].

===Overseas bases and relations===

[[Farkhor Air Base]] is a military air base located near the town of Farkhor in Tajikistan, 130 kilometres (81&amp;nbsp;mi) south east of the capital Dushanbe.

On 9 June 2012, the JIMEX 2012 naval exercise took place off the coast of Tamil Nadu in India to Tokyo in Japan. This was the first ever bilateral maritime exercise between the two nations in a long time, reflecting their similar interests, especially the ones involving spontaneous regional security against common external aggressors. [[Indian Navy]] also has berthing rights in [[Oman]] and [[Vietnam]].

As part of its two decade-old [[Look East policy (India)|Look East policy]], India has substantially stepped up military engagement with East Asian and [[ASEAN]] nations. Although never explicitly stated, ASEAN and East Asian nations want New Delhi to be a counterweight to increasing Chinese footprints in the region. Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and, particularly, Vietnam and Myanmar have time and again pressed India to help them both in terms of military training and weapons supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India's Growing Military Diplomacy|url=http://thediplomat.com/2013/08/16/indias-growing-military-diplomacy/|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myanmar's Navy Chief, Vice Admiral Thura Thet Swe during his four-day visit to India in late July 2012 held wide-ranging consultations with top officials from the Indian Ministry of Defence. Apart from increasing the number of training slots of Myanmar officers in Indian military training establishments, India has agreed to build at least four Offshore Patrol Vehicles (OPV) in Indian Shipyards to be used by Myanmar's navy. For more than a decade now, India has been providing Vietnam with assistance in beefing up its naval and air capabilities. For instance, India has repaired and upgraded more than 100 MiG 21 planes of the Vietnam People's Air Force and supplied them with enhanced avionics and radar systems. Indian Air Force pilots have also been training their Vietnamese counterparts. In a first, India has offered a $100-million credit line to Vietnam to purchase military equipment. A bilateral agreement for utilisation of facilities in India by the Singapore Air Force and Army was signed in October 2007 and August 2008 respectively and has been extended up to 2017.

==[[Indian Army]]==

[[File:Arjun Tank.jpg|thumb|right|Indian Army's [[Arjun (tank)|Arjun]] tank]]
It is a voluntary service, the [[military draft]] having never been imposed in India.  It is one of the largest standing armies (and the largest standing volunteer army) in the world, with 1,129,900 active troops and 960,000 reserve troops. The force is headed by the [[Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army]], [[General Dalbir Singh Suhag]]. The highest rank in the Indian Army is [[Field Marshal]], but it is a largely ceremonial rank and appointments are made by the [[President of India]], on the advice of the [[Union Cabinet of India|Union Cabinet]] of Ministers, only in exceptional circumstances. (See [[Field Marshal (India)]]). Late [[Sam Manekshaw|Field Marshal S.H.F.J. Manekshaw]] and the late [[Field Marshal Kodandera Madappa Cariappa]] are the only two officers who have attained this rank.

The army has rich combat experience in diverse terrains, due to India's diverse geography, and also has a distinguished history of serving in [[United Nations]] [[peacekeeping]] operations. Initially, the army's main objective was to defend the nation's frontiers. However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of providing internal security, especially in insurgent-hit [[Kashmir]] and [[Assam|north-east]]. The [[Indian Army]] has seen military action during the [[First Kashmir War]], [[Operation Polo]], the [[Sino-Indian War]], the [[Second Kashmir War]], the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] and the [[Kargil War]]. The [[Indian army]] has dedicated one [[brigade]] of troops to the [[UN]]'s standby arrangements. Through its large, sustained troop commitments India has come in for much praise for taking part in difficult operations for prolonged periods. The Indian Army has participated in several UN [[peacekeeping]] operations, including the ones in [[Cyprus]], [[Lebanon]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Namibia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Liberia]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Somalia]]. The army also provided a [[paramedical]] unit to facilitate the withdrawal of the sick and wounded in [[Korean War|Korea]].

===Doctrine, corps, field force===
[[File:Pinaka.JPG|thumb|[[Pinaka multi barrel rocket launcher]] of the Indian Army.]]
The current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Start Doctrine|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/cold-start.htm|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down whilst the strike formations attack at a point of Indian choosing. The Indian Army is large enough to devote several corps to the strike role. The army is also looking at enhancing its special forces capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Army raising new special forces battalion|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indian-army-raising-new-special-forces-battalion_715382.html|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the role of India increasing and the requirement for protection of India's interest in far off shores become important, the Indian Army and Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Army and Navy Seek Permission to Set Up Marine Brigade|url=http://www.defence.pk/forums/indian-defence/61300-indian-army-navy-seek-permission-set-up-marine-brigade.html|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field force of the army comprises thirteen corps, three armoured divisions, four Reorganised Army plains Infantry Divisions (RAPID), eighteen infantry divisions and ten mountain divisions, a number of independent brigades, and requisite combat support and service support formations and units. Among the thirteen, three are &quot;strike&quot; corps&amp;nbsp;— Mathura (I Corps), Ambala ( II Corps) and Bhopal (XXI Corps). The main combat and combat support units are 62 armoured regiments, and there are over 350 infantry battalions and 300 artillery regiments (including two surface-to-surface missile (SSM) units). Amongst major armaments and equipment, there are nearly 4000 main battle tanks, 2000 armoured personnel carriers, 4300 artillery pieces and 200 light helicopters.

====Mountain Strike Corps====
India is raising a new mountain strike corps to strengthen its defence along its disputed border with China in the high reaches of the Himalayas. The entire XVII Corps, with its headquarters at [[Panagarh]] in [[West Bengal]], will however be fully raised with 90,274 troops at a cost of Rs 64,678 crore only by 2018–2019. With units spread across the 4,057-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) from [[Ladakh]] to [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the corps will have two high-altitude infantry divisions (59 Div at Panagarh and 72 Div at Pathankot) with their integral units, two independent infantry brigades, two armoured brigades and the like. It will include 30 new infantry battalions and two Para-Special Forces battalions. In other words, it will get some &quot;rapid reaction force&quot; capability to launch a counter-offensive into [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] (TAR) in the event of any Chinese attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Army chief reviews mountain strike corps|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Army-chief-reviews-mountain-strike-corps/articleshow/34795843.cms|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Army Aviation Corps (India)|Army Aviation Corps]]===

[[File:Hindustan ALH Dhruv, India - Army AN1546730.jpg|thumb|Indian Army's [[HAL Dhruv]] helicopter.]]
The [[Army Aviation Corps (India)|Army Aviation Corps]] is another vital component of the Indian Army formed on 1 November 1986. The army aviation pilots are drawn from other combat arms, including artillery officers, to form a composite third dimensional force for an integrated battle. IAF operates &amp; flies attack Helicopters like the Mil Mi-25/Mi-35 which are owned and administered by the Indian Air Force, but under the operational control of the Army &amp; play a major role to support the armoured columns and infantry. Apart from the attack role, helicopters like the HAL Chetak, HAL Cheetah, and HAL Dhruv provide logistical support for the Indian Army in remote and inaccessible areas, especially the [[Siachen Glacier]]. To equip Army Aviation Corps, procurement process for 197 light utility helicopters (LUH) is ongoing, of which 64 will be inducted in the Army Aviation to replace the Cheetak and Cheetah Helicopters. [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited|HAL]] has obtained a firm order to deliver 114 HAL [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter|Light Combat Helicopters]] to the Indian Army.

===Modernisation===

====Mechanised forces====
[[File:Yudh Abhyas-09 T-90.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Indian Army]]'s tanks and infantry vehicles during an exercise.]]
India is re-organising its mechanised forces to achieve strategic mobility and high-volume firepower for rapid thrusts into enemy territory. At present the Indian army has severe deficiencies in its artillery (particularly self-propelled guns) and ammunition stocks, not to mention the inability of some of its modern tanks to operate in the heat and dust of the desert regions around the international border.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladwig2&quot;&gt;Walter C. Ladwig III {{cite web|url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2015.1014473  |title= Indian Military Modernization and Conventional Deterrence in South Asia |work= Journal of Strategic Studies |volume=38 |issue=5 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  India proposes to progressively induct as many as 248 [[Arjun MBT]] and develop and induct the Arjun MK-II variant, 1,657 Russian-origin [[T-90]]S main-battle tanks, apart from the ongoing upgrade of its [[T-72]] fleet. In fact, Arjun MK-II trials have already started in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arjun MK-II user trials kicked off in Rajasthan|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-08-13/india/41371931_1_arjun-mbt-drdo-development-establishment|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The improved features in MK-II version of Arjun are night vision capabilities with thermal imaging system for detecting all kinds of missiles, [[Explosive Reactive Armor]] (ERA), mine ploughs, ability to fire Anti-tank missile with 120&amp;nbsp;mm main gun, [[Corps of Army Air Defence (India)|Advanced Air Defence]] gun capable of shooting down Helicopters with a 360 degree coverage, Automatic Target Tracking (ATT) lending a greater accuracy when it comes to moving targets and superior Laser Warning and Control systems. The Indian Army will upgrade its entire Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty-2 ([[BMP-2]])/2K [[infantry combat vehicle]] (ICV) fleet in an effort to enhance their capability to address operational requirements. Upgrades include integration of latest generation fire control system, twin missile launchers and commander's thermal imaging panoramic sights, anti- tank guided missiles, as well as automatic grenade launchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Army set to upgrade BMP-2/2K infantry fighting vehicle fleet|url=http://www.army-technology.com/news/newsindian-army-upgrade-bmp-22k-infantry-fighting-vehicle-fleet|accessdate=26 September 2013}}{{unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Field Artillery Rationalisation Plan, the army plans to procure 3000 to 4000 pieces of artillery at the cost of US$3 billion. This includes purchasing 1580 towed, 814 mounted, 180 self-propelled wheeled, 100 self-propelled tracked and 145 ultra-light 155&amp;nbsp;mm/52 calibre artillery guns. After three years of search and negotiations, in September 2013, India ordered [[M777 howitzer|M777]] 155mm howitzers from USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunnigan|first=James|title=India Joins The M-777 Club|url=http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/India-Joins-The-M-777-Club-9-8-2013.asp|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To lend greater firepower support to the mechanised infantry, DRDO has developed [[Pinaka Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher|Pinaka]] [[multiple rocket launcher]]. The system has a maximum range of 39–40&amp;nbsp;km and can fire a [[salvo]] of 12  [[Explosive material|HE]] rockets in 44 seconds, neutralising a target area of 3.9&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The system is mounted on a [[Tatra cars|Tatra]] truck for mobility.

====Infantry====

The Indian Army has also embarked on an infantry modernisation programme known as '''F'''uturistic '''In'''fantry '''S'''oldier '''A'''s a '''S'''ystem ([[F-INSAS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katoch|first=Prakash|title=Modernisation of the Indian Infantry|url=http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/modernisation-of-the-indian-infantry/|work=Indian Defense Review|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The infantry soldiers will be equipped with modular weapon systems that will have multi-functions. The core systems include bullet proof helmet and visor. The bullet proof helmet is an integrated assembly equipped with helmet mounted flash light, thermal sensors and night vision device, miniature computer with audio headsets. The personal clothing of this soldier of the future would be lightweight with a bullet-proof jacket. The futuristic jacket would be waterproof, yet it would be possible to breathe. The new attire will enable the troops to carry extra load and resist the impact of nuclear, chemical and biological warfare. The new uniform will have vests with sensors to monitor the soldier's health parameters and provide quick medical relief. The weapons sub-system is built around a multi calibre individual weapon system with the fourth calibre attached to a grenade launcher. These include a 5.56&amp;nbsp;mm, a 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm and a new 6.8&amp;nbsp;mm under development for the first time in India.

In November 2013, Indian Army moved a step closer to the battlefield of the future, where command networks know the precise location of every soldier and weapon, with whom generals can exchange reports, photos, data and verbal and written communications. Army headquarters called in 14 Indian companies and issued them an expression of interest (EoI) for developing a Battlefield Management System (BMS). The BMS will integrate combat units&amp;nbsp;— armoured, artillery and infantry regiments, infantry battalions, helicopter flights, etc.&amp;nbsp;— into a digital network that will link together all components of the future battlefield. While precise costs are still unclear, vendors competing for the contract say the army expects to pay about Rs 40,000 crore for developing and manufacturing the BMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Army kicks off high-tech 'digital soldier' project|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/army-kicks-off-high-tech-digital-soldier-project-113111100986_1.html|publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2015, Indian Army decided to replace the F-INSAS program in favour of two separate projects. The new program will have two components: one arming the modern infantry soldier with the best available assault rifle, carbines and personal equipment such as the helmet and bulletproof vests and the second component is the Battlefield Management Systems (BMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.defenseworld.net/news/11907/Indian_Army_to_Break_up_Future_Soldier_Program_into_Two_Parts|title=Indian Army to Break up Future Soldier Program into Two Parts|work=defenseworld.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercises===
[[File:Indian army lady officer.jpg|thumb|A female [[Indian Army]] officer briefing Russian soldiers during a joint exercise in 2015]]
*''Exercise Yuddh Abhyas'' is part of an ongoing series of joint exercises between the Indian and United States Armies since 2005, agreed upon under the New Framework of India-US Defence Relationship. Commencing at the platoon level, the exercise has graduated to a command post (CPX) and field training exercise (FTX).
*''Exercise Shakti'' is an ongoing series of joint exercises between the Indian and French armies since 2011. Exercise Shakti is conducted to practice and validate anti terrorist operations and drills in snowbound and mountainous areas.
*''Exercise Indra'' is a bi-annual military exercise conducted jointly by India and Russia, starting from 2003. 
*''Exercise Nomadic Elephant'' is a series of exercises held by the Indian Army with the Mongolian Army. The aim of the exercises is to enhance counter insurgency and counter terrorism operations, and conduct peacekeeping operations under the mandate of the United Nation.
*''Exercise Rudra Akrosh'', in May 2012, was an exercise carried out by the Indian Army to test the preparedness level of its units and to validate new age technology, battle concepts, organisational structures and networked operations. The Western Army Command conducted the exercise in Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir.
*''Exercise Ashwamedha'' was a recent exercise to test the armies network-centric warfare capabilities. It was held in the Thar desert, in which over 300,000 troops participated. Asymmetric warfare capability was also tested by the Indian Army during the exercise.

===Ships===
[[File:INS Vikramaditya - 02.jpg|thumb|Indian Navy ships in transit led by Aircraft carrier [[INS Vikramaditya]]]]
Indian navy's carrier fleet revolves around [[INS Viraat (R22)|INS Viraat]], a [[Centaur-class aircraft carrier]], formerly with British Navy. Navy's second aircraft carrier, [[INS Vikramaditya]], was commissioned into the Indian Navy at a Russian shipyard on 16 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After 5-year delay, Navy gets INS Vikramaditya|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-11-17/india/44161814_1_ins-vikramaditya-viraat-warship|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  INS Vikramaditya was escorted to India during a nearly two-month voyage by a group of warships to secure a safe sail to its new base at Karwar on the Arabian Sea coast next to Goa. The navy also operates three [[Delhi-class destroyer|Delhi-class]] and five [[Rajput-class destroyer|Rajput class]] guided-missile destroyers. The Delhi and Rajput class destroyers will be replaced in the near future by the next-generation [[Kolkata-class destroyer|Kolkata class]] (Project 15A destroyers).  In addition to destroyers, the navy operates several classes of frigates such as three [[Shivalik-class frigate|Shivalik]] (Project 16 class) and six [[Talwar-class frigate|Talwar class]] frigates. Seven additional Shivalik class frigates (Project 17A class frigates) are on order. The older [[Brahmaputra-class frigate|Brahmaputra class]] and [[Godavari-class frigate|Godavari class]] frigates will systematically be replaced one by one as the new classes of frigates are brought into service over the next decade. Smaller littoral zone combatants in service are in the form of corvettes, of which, the Indian Navy operates the [[Kamorta-class corvette|Kamorta]], [[Kora-class corvette|Kora]], [[Khukri-class corvette|Khukri]], [[Veer-class corvette|Veer]] and [[Abhay-class corvette|Abhay]] classes corvettes. Replenishment tankers such as the Jyoti class tanker, the [[Aditya-class auxiliary ship|Aditya]] and the new [[Deepak-class fleet tanker|Deepak class]] fleet tankers help improve the navy's endurance at sea. The [[Deepak-class fleet tanker|Deepak class]] tankers will be the mainstay of the replenishment fleet until the first half of the 21st century.

===Submarines===

The Indian Navy operates a sizeable fleet of [[Sindhughosh-class submarine|Sindhughosh]] (Russian [[Kilo-class submarine|Kilo-class]] design) and Shishumar (German Type 209/1500 design) class submarines. A nuclear-powered attack submarine [[INS Chakra]] has been leased from Russia. India has started construction of six [[Scorpène-class submarine|Scorpène class]] submarines at Mazagon Dockyards Limited (MDL), in Mumbai under technology transfer from French firm DCNS. The new submarines will feature [[air-independent propulsion]] and are expected to start joining the navy during the second half of 2016.  Designed for coastal defence against under-water threats, the 1,750-tonne submarine-submarine-killer (SSK) Scorpene is 67 meters in length and can dive to a depth of 300 meters. According to French naval officials, the submarine can stay at sea for 45 days with a crew of 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Scorpene submarine would be ready by 2014: French envoy|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-13/news/38511459_1_indian-navy-six-scorpene-submarines-french-firm-dcns|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Indian Naval Air Arm|Naval Air Arm]]===
[[File:Boeing P-8I of the Indian Navy.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8I Neptune]] anti-submarine warfare aircraft of the Indian Navy]]

The [[Indian Naval Air Arm]] is a branch of Indian Navy which is tasked to provide an aircraft carrier based strike capability, fleet air defence, maritime reconnaissance, and anti-submarine warfare. Flag Officer Naval Aviation (FONA) at Goa directs the field operations of the air arm. Naval Air Arm operates eight [[Tu-142]] aircraft, which entered service in 1988. Upgrading of the aircraft are taking place, which helps to extend the service life of the aircraft by sixteen years. The [[BAE Sea Harrier]] operates from the INS Viraat. The BAE Sea Harrier FRS Mk.51 / T Mk.60 fly with the [[INAS 300]] and [[INAS 552]] squadrons of the Indian Navy. The [[Mikoyan MiG-29K]] will be deployed aboard the [[INS Vikramaditya]]. Indian Navy operates 5 [[Il-38]] planes. They are being upgraded to use Sea Dragon suite. Used principally for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and search &amp; rescue roles, the helicopter fleet of [[Westland Sea King]] and the Sikorsky [[SH-3 Sea King]] operate from [[INS Garuda]] (Kochi) as well as INS Kunjali-II (Mumbai) air stations. 56 more naval utility helicopters are planned to be inducted from 2016. These will be used for surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, electronic intelligence gathering and search and rescue operations. The helicopters will be equipped with 70mm rocket launchers, 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm guns, lightweight torpedoes and depth charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navy to buy 56 utility helicopters for $1bn|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-11/india/33152341_1_utility-helicopters-eurocopter-multi-role-helicopters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Navy will also continue to procure [[HAL Dhruv]] as a multi-role utility platform.  In the long-range maritime reconnaissance (LRMR) role, Navy uses Boeing [[P-8 Poseidon|P-8I Neptune]] and has issued a global tender for nine medium-range maritime reconnaissance (MRMR) aircraft for coastal defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India Issues Global Tender for Maritime Recon Planes |url=http://www.indiandefence.com/forums/indian-navy/31594-india-issues-global-tender-maritime-recon-planes.html|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval satellite===
India's first exclusive defence satellite [[GSAT-7]] was successfully launched by European space consortium Arianespace's Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou spaceport in [[French Guiana]] in August 2013, giving a major push to the country's maritime security. Indian Navy would be the user of the multi-band home-built communication spacecraft, and is operational. GSAT-7 was designed and developed by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) and is expected to operate for seven years in its orbital slot at 74 degrees east, providing [[UHF]], [[S-band]], [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] and [[Ku-band]] relay capacity. Its Ku-band capacity is expected to provide high-density data transmission facility, both for voice and video. This satellite has been provided with additional power to communicate with smaller and mobile (not necessarily land-based) terminals. This dedicated satellite is expected to provide the Indian navy with an approximately 3,500- to 4,000-kilometer footprint over the Indian Ocean region, and over both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal region and enable real-time networking of all its operational assets in the water (and land). It also will help the navy to operate in a network-centric atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lele|first=Ajey|title=GSAT-7: India's Strategic Satellite|url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/opinion/37142gsat-7-india%E2%80%99s-strategic-satellite|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercises===

India often conducts naval exercises with other friendly countries designed to increase naval interoperability and also to strengthen cooperative security relationship. Some such exercises take place annually like the ''Varuna'' with the French Navy, ''Konkan'' with the Royal Navy, ''Indra'' with Russian Navy, ''[[Exercise Malabar|Malabar]]'' with the US/Japan/Australian Navy, ''Simbex'' with the Republic of Singapore Navy and ''[[IBSAMAR]]'' with the Brasil and South African navies. In 2007, Indian Navy conducted naval exercise with Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force and U.S Navy in the Pacific and also signed an agreement with Japan in October 2008 for joint naval patrolling in the Asia-Pacific region. India has also held naval exercise with Vietnam, Philippines and New Zealand. In 2007, India and South Korea decided to conduct annual naval exercise and India participated in the South Korean international fleet review. In addition, Indian Navy will also be increasing naval co-operation with other allies, particularly with Germany, and Arab states of the Persian Gulf including Kuwait, Oman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Naseem Al Bahr', a Naval Exercise between Indian &amp; Oman Navy Held|url=http://indiannavy.nic.in/press-release/naseem-al-bahr-naval-exercise-between-indian-oman-navy-held|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India and Saudi Arabia to Conduct Joint Naval and Military Exercises and Help Eliminate Piracy|url=http://www.defencenow.com/news/135/india-and-saudi-arabia-to-conduct-joint-naval-and-military-exercises-and-help-eliminate-piracy.html|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Navy also took part in the world's largest naval exercise/war-game [[Exercise RIMPAC|RIMPAC 2014]] along with 22 other nations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gupta|first=Shishir|title=India to play sea war games with 22 nations|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/India-to-play-sea-war-games-with-22-nations/Article1-1119373.aspx|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since taken part in RIMPAC each year.

===Modernisation===

In recent years, the Indian Navy has undergone [[Indian Navy#Ongoing expansion|modernisation and expansion]] with the intention of countering growing Chinese maritime power in the Indian Ocean and reaching the status of a recognised [[blue-water navy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmss.org/2008/winter/articles/scott.pdf India's drive for a 'Blue water' Navy by Dr. David Scott, International Relations, Brunel University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/published/12steps.htm India's 12 Steps to a World-Class Navy]&lt;/ref&gt; New equipment programmes include; the lease of a nuclear-powered submarine [[INS Chakra]] from Russia, the ex-Soviet carrier [[INS Vikramaditya]] and the first of the indigenously built [[INS Arihant|Arihant class]] ballistic missile submarines by 2016, the first of the [[Scorpene class submarine]]s by 2016 and the indigenously built aircraft carrier [[Vikrant class aircraft carrier|INS Vikrant]] by 2018. The plan in the near future is to have two aircraft carriers at sea at all times, with a third docked up in maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-08/rest-of-world/27886608_1_carrier-battle-aircraft-carrier-admiral-gorshkov|title=Carrier battle groups will add muscle to Navy power|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programmes include the [[Talwar class frigate|Talwar]] and [[Shivalik class frigate|Shivalik]] frigates and the [[Kolkata class destroyer]]s, all of which will be equipped with the [[BrahMos]] cruise missile. In a significant step towards India's pursuit for self-reliance in indigenous warship building, four anti-submarine [[Kamorta-class corvette|Kamorta-class]] stealth corvettes (with features such as an [[Convex hull|X Form Hull]] and inclined sides for low [[Radar cross-section]], [[Infrared signature|Infra-red suppression]], and [[Acoustic quieting]] systems) are being built for the Indian Navy.

Recent induction of attack submarine [[INS Chakra]] and the development of [[INS Arihant]] make the Indian Navy one of six navies worldwide that are capable of building and operating nuclear-powered submarines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navy Chief Assures Sea Trials of Homegrown Nuclear Submarine INS Arihant Soon|url=http://www.defencenow.com/news/830/navy-chief-assures-sea-trials-of-homegrown-nuclear-submarine-ins-arihant-soon.html|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – others include China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. India also launched a 37,500-ton indigenous aircraft carrier [[INS Vikrant]] in August 2013 in its bid to join a select group of nations (United States, the United Kingdom, Russia and France) capable of building such warships. The warship will undergo extensive tests in the next few years before it is commissioned into the navy. The INS Vikrant, is expected to carry [[MiG-29K|MiG 29K]] fighters and light combat aircraft such as [[HAL Tejas]].

India is also set to become the first country to buy a military aircraft from Japan since World War II. India is expected to sign a deal for the purchase of six Utility [[ShinMaywa US-2|Seaplane Mark 2 (US-2)]] amphibian aircraft when Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] visits Japan from 31 August – 3 September 2014. The 47-tonne US-2 aircraft doesn't require a long airstrip to take-off or to land. It is capable of taking off from land and water (300-metre stretch). It can carry loads of up to 18 tonnes and can be engaged in search and rescue operations. With a range of over 4,500&amp;nbsp;km, it can patrol areas 1,800&amp;nbsp;km away and react to an emergency by landing 30 armed troops even in 10-foot waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First time since WW-II, India to buy amphibious aircraft from Japan|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-first-time-since-ww-ii-india-to-buy-amphibious-aircraft-from-japan-2012934|publisher=DNA India|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Air Force is the air arm of the Indian armed forces. Its primary responsibility is to secure Indian [[airspace]] and to conduct [[aerial warfare]] during a conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the [[British Raj]] and the prefix ''Royal'' was added in 1945 in recognition of its services during World War II. After India achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, the Royal Indian Air Force served the [[Dominion of India]], with the prefix being dropped when India became a republic in 1950. The Indian Air Force plays a crucial role in securing Indian airspace and also in India's power projection in South Asia and Indian Ocean. Therefore, modernising and expanding the Indian Air Force is a top priority for the Indian government. Over the years, the IAF has grown from a tactical force to one with transoceanic reach. The strategic reach emerges from induction of Force Multipliers like Flight Refueling Aircraft (FRA), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and credible strategic lift capabilities.

===Aircraft===
{{Main article|List of active Indian military aircraft}}
[[File:SU-30 MKI Idaho.jpg|thumb|India's [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]]]]

Historically, the IAF has generally relied on Soviet, British, Israeli and French military craft and technology to support its growth. IAF's primary air superiority fighter with the additional capability to conduct air-ground (strike) missions is [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]]. The IAF have placed an order for a total of 272 Su-30MKIs of which 205 are in service as of May 2015. The Mikoyan [[MiG-29]] is a dedicated air superiority fighter and constitutes a second line of defence after the Sukhoi Su-30MKI. At present, 66 MiG-29s are in service, all of which are being upgraded to the MiG-29UPG standard. The [[Dassault Mirage 2000]] is the primary multirole fighter in service and the IAF operates 49 Mirage 2000Hs which are being upgraded to the Mirage 2000-5 MK2 standard. As part of the upgrade, the aircraft will also be equipped with MBDA's [[MICA (missile)|MICA]] family of medium-range missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India's Fighter Upgrades: Mirage 2000s Finally Get a Deal|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/indias-fighter-upgrades-mirage-2000s-next-02891/|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For giving the IAF fighters an edge in anti-ship and land attack roles, smaller version of [[BrahMos]] missile is being developed to be integrated in Sukhoi Su-30MKI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smaller version of BrahMos missile being developed for IAF|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/smaller-version-of-brahmos-missile-being-developed-for-iaf_830168.html|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to be delivered to IAF by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Force to receive BrahMos by 2015|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/air-force-to-receive-brahmos-by-2015-113112100703_1.html|publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aerial refuelling (tanker) role, the IAF operates six [[Ilyushin Il-78]]MKIs. For strategic military transport operations the IAF uses the [[Ilyushin Il-76]], and has placed orders for 10 Boeing [[C-17 Globemaster III]], four of which were [[C-17 Globemaster III#Indian Air Force|delivered]] by November 2013. The [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J Super-Hercules]] planes of the IAF is used by special forces for combined Army-Air Force operations. There are six C-130Js in service and six more are planned to be procured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=NAK Browne|title=IAF looking to induct seven more C-17 aircraft|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-09-30/news/42537006_1_iaf-chief-nak-browne-c-17-aircraft|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Antonov An-32]] serves as medium transport aircraft in the IAF.

As an airborne early warning system, the IAF operates the Israeli EL/W-2090 [[EL/M-2075|Phalcon]] AEW&amp;C. A total of three such systems are in service, with possible orders for two more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pandit|first=Rajat|title=IAF will add two more Israeli AWACS to its fleet|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-08/india/30373087_1_fighters-during-combat-operations-360-degree-phalcon-early-warning-radar-air-defence-fighters|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DRDO AEW&amp;CS|Airborne Early Warning and Control System]] (AEWACS) is a project of India's DRDO to develop an [[Airborne early warning and control|AEW&amp;C]] system for the Indian Air Force. The DRDO AEWACS programme aims to deliver three radar-equipped surveillance aircraft to the Indian Air Force. The aircraft platform selected was the Embraer ERJ 145. Three ERJ 145 were procured from Embraer at a cost of US $300 Million, including the contracted modifications to the airframe. Probable delivery date for the first batch of three is 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DRDO AWACS first batch delivery by 2015|url=http://uvpcemecharocks.blogspot.in/2012/02/drdo-awacs-first-batch-delivery-by-2015.html|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network-centric warfare===
[[File:DRDO AEW&amp;C Embraer ERJ 145.JPG|thumb|right|[[DRDO AEW&amp;CS]]]]
The Indian Air Force (IAF) made progress towards becoming a truly network centric air force with the integration of [[Air Force Network|Air Force Network (AFNET)]], a reliable and robust digital information grid that enables accurate and faster response to enemy threats, in 2010. The modern, state-of-the-art AFNET is a fully secure communication network, providing IAF a critical link among its command and control centre, sensors such as the Airborne Early Warning and Control Systems and attack platforms such as fighter aircraft and missile launchers. Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS), an automated command and control system for Air Defence (AD) operations will ride the AFNet backbone integrating all ground-based and airborne sensors, AD weapon systems and C2 nodes. 
[[File:C-130 J.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130 J]] tactical transport aircraft]]

Subsequent integration with other services networks and civil radars will provide an integrated Air Situation Picture to operators to carry out Air Defence role. AFNet will prove to be an effective [[force multiplier]] for intelligence analysis, mission planning and control, post-mission feedback and related activities like maintenance, logistics and administration. A comprehensive design with multi-layer security precautions for &quot;Defence in Depth&quot; have been planned by incorporating encryption technologies, Intrusion Prevention Systems to ensure the resistance of the IT system against information manipulation and eavesdropping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IAF's AFNET NCW Backbone Goes Live Next Week|url=http://www.livefistdefence.com/2010/09/iafs-afnet-goes-live-next-week.html|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, IAF launched its own stand-alone Rs 300 crore cellular network through which secure video calling and other information exchange facilities will be provided. The IAF also plans to issue around one hundred thousand mobile handsets to its personnel of the rank of Sergeants and above to connect and provide secure 'end-point' connectivity to the air warriors deployed across the country. The captive network has been named 'Air Force Cellular'. While Phase I of the project will ensure mobile connectivity to all air warriors in the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]], its Phase II will cover the rest of the bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IAF launches own 3G cellular network|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/iaf-launches-own-3g-cellular-network-113102500946_1.html|publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HAL LCH at Aero india 2013.JPG|thumb|The [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter]] in digital camouflage.]]
The [[Indian MRCA competition|Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) competition]], also known as the MRCA tender, was a competition to supply 126 multi-role combat aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF). The Defence Ministry has allocated ~ US$13 billion for the purchase of these aircraft, making it India's single largest defence deal. The MRCA tender was floated with the idea of filling the gap between its future Light Combat Aircraft and its in-service Sukhoi Su-30MKI air superiority fighter. On 31 January 2012, it was announced that [[Dassault Rafale]] won the competition due to its lower life-cycle cost. The Indian Air Force (IAF) is also in the final stages of acquiring 22 [[AH-64 Apache|Apache Longbow gunships]], armed with [[Hellfire missile|Hellfire]] and Stinger missiles in a $1.2 billion contract and 15 heavy-lift [[Chinook helicopter|Boeing CH Chinook helicopters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;economictimes.indiatimes.com&quot;/&gt; The IAF has initiated the process for acquisition of additional [[Mi-17]] IV helicopters, heavy lift helicopters, Advanced Light Helicopter and Light Combat Helicopters. Among trainer aircraft, the [[BAE Systems Hawk|Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer]] has been inducted and the [[HAL HJT-36 Sitara|Intermediate Jet Trainer]] (IJT) would be acquired in the near future.

In recent times, India has also manufactured its own aircraft such as the [[HAL Tejas]], a 4th generation fighter, and the [[HAL Dhruv]], a [[utility helicopter|multi-role]] helicopter, which has been exported to several countries, including [[Israel]], [[Burma]], [[Nepal]] and [[Ecuador]]. An weaponised version of Dhruv is called [[HAL Rudra]], which is armed with high-velocity M621 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon, long-range 70&amp;nbsp;mm rockets (8&amp;nbsp;km), air-to-air missiles (Mistral-II). and MAWS (missile approach warning system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALH Rudra ready to spit fire|url=http://tarmak007.blogspot.in/2012/02/alh-rudra-ready-to-spit-fire-hal.html|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kargil War|Combat in Kargil]] highlighted the requirement of an attack helicopter specially made for such high-altitude operations. The [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter]] (LCH) is a multirole combat helicopter being developed in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for use by the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army. The LCH is being designed to fit into an anti-infantry and anti-armour role and will be able to operate at high altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domain-b.com/aero/June/2007/20070620_hal.htm|title=domain-b.com : Paris Air Show: First flight of HAL`s light combat helicopter in 2008|work=domain-b.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; LCH will be fitted with indigenous anti-tank missile [[Nag (missile)|Helina]].

India also maintains [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] squadrons (primarily [[IAI Searcher|Searcher-II]] and [[IAI Heron|Heron]] from Israel) which can be used to carry out ground and aerial surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel sells heron UAVs to India and Australia|url=http://www.strategypage.com/militaryforums/512-20022.aspx#startofcomments|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  India is also testing its own long-range [[Beyond Visual Range missile|BVR]] air-to-air missile named [[Astra Missile|Astra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/05/08/stories/2009050855501300.htm |title=National : Astra missile test-fired |work=The Hindu |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also building a Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) called [[DRDO Rustom|Rustom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdo.com/dpi/SAsiaDefnStraRev_.pdf |accessdate=25 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102024254/http://drdo.com/dpi/SAsiaDefnStraRev_.pdf |archivedate=2 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India is also in an ambitious collaboration programme with Russia to build [[Fifth-generation jet fighter|fifth-generation]] fighter aircraft, called [[FGFA|HAL/Sukhoi FGFA]] which will be based on Russian [[PAK-FA]] fighter. Earlier in 2013, the two sides completed the preliminary design of the FGFA and are now negotiating a detailed design contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India to customise Russia's FGFA planes|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/india-to-customise-russias-fgfa-planes/article5075134.ece|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no reliable information about the PAK FA and FGFA specifications yet, it is known from interviews with people in the Russian Air Force that it will be [[Stealth aircraft|stealthy]], have the ability to [[supercruise]], be outfitted with the next generation of air-to-air, air-to-surface, and air-to-ship missiles, and incorporate an [[AESA radar]].

Co-development and co-production of [[UAC/HAL Il-214|Multi-role Transport Aircraft]] (MTA), jointly by Russian partners and HAL, is being launched to meet the requirement of Russian and Indian Air Forces. The aircraft will be designed for the roles of a 15–20 ton Cargo / Troop transport, Para trooping / Airdrop of supplies including Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES) capability. It will be configured such that all types of cargo can be transported and the aircraft would be capable of operating from semi prepared runways. The MTA is expected to replace the Indian Air Force's ageing fleet of Antonov An-32 transport aircraft. The aircraft is expected to conduct its first flight by 2017, and to enter service by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian-Indian Military Transport JV Debuts at Aero India|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/ain-news-live-aeroindia/2013-02-05/russian-indian-military-transport-jv-debuts-aero-india|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect IAF assets on the ground, there has been search for short-range surface-to-air missile. India has begun deploying six [[Akash (missile)|Akash]] surface-to-air missile (SAM) squadrons in the northeast to deter Chinese jets, helicopters and drones against any misadventure in the region.

[[File:Assam rifles.png|thumb|left|[[Assam Rifles]] personnel]]

The Assam Rifles can trace their lineage to a paramilitary police force that was formed under the British in 1835 called ''Cachar Levy''. Since then the Assam Rifles have undergone a number of name changes before the name ''Assam Rifles'' was finally adopted in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;The Assam Frontier Police (1883), the Assam Military Police (1891) and Eastern Bengal and Assam Military Police (1913), before finally becoming the Assam Rifles in 1917. See Sharma 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of its history, the Assam Rifles and its predecessor units have served in a number of roles, conflicts and theatres including World War I where they served in Europe and the Middle East, and World War II where they served mainly in Burma. In the post World War II period the Assam Rifles has expanded greatly as has its role. There are currently 46 battalions&lt;ref name=History&gt;See [http://assamrifles.net/site/aboutus.htm History of the Assam Rifles]&lt;/ref&gt; of Assam Rifles under the control of the Indian [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] (MHA) and they perform many roles including the provision of internal security under the control of the army through the conduct of counter insurgency and border security operations, provision of aid to the civil power in times of emergency, and the provision of communications, medical assistance and education in remote areas.&lt;ref name=Sharma&gt;Sharma 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In times of war they can also be used as a combat force to secure rear areas if needed.

===[[Special Frontier Force]]===

The Special Frontier Force (SFF) is a [[paramilitary]] unit of [[India]]. It was initially conceived in the post [[Sino-Indian war]] period as a guerrilla force composed mainly of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[refugees]] whose main goal was to conduct covert operations behind Chinese lines in case of another war between the [[People's Republic of China]] and India. Later, its composition and roles were expanded.

Based in [[Chakrata]], [[Uttarakhand]], SFF is also known as the ''Establishment 22''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chushigangdruk.org/history/history11.htm|title=Welcome chushigangdruk.org - Hostmonster.com|work=chushigangdruk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The SFF became morle famous within the administration as the &quot;Establishment 22&quot; because its first Inspector General (IG) Major Gen.

==Weapons of mass destruction==
{{Main article|India and weapons of mass destruction}}

===Chemical and biological weapons===
In 1992 India signed the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (CWC), stating that it did not have chemical weapons and the capacity or capability to manufacture chemical weapons. By doing this India became one of the original signatories of the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] in 1993, and ratified it on 2 September 1996. In June 1997, India declared its stock of chemical weapons (1,044 tonnes of [[sulphur mustard]]). By the end of 2006, India had destroyed more than 75 percent of its chemical weapons/material stockpile and was granted extension for destroying the remaining stocks by April 2009 and was expected to achieve 100 percent destruction within that time frame. India informed the United Nations in May 2009 that it had destroyed its stockpile of chemical weapons in compliance with the international Chemical Weapons Convention. With this India has become third country after South Korea and Albania to do so. This was cross-checked by inspectors of the United Nations.

India has also ratified the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (January 1973) and pledges to abide by its obligations. There is no clear evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, that directly points toward an offensive biological weapon programme. India does possess the scientific capability and infrastructure to launch such an offensive programme, but has chosen not to do so.

===Nuclear weapons===
{{main article|India and weapons of mass destruction|Nuclear Command Authority (India)|Strategic Forces Command}}
[[File:Agni Missile Range comparison.svg|thumb|right|300px|Range comparison of [[Agni (missile)|Agni]] missiles.]]
India has been in possession of [[nuclear weapon]]s since 1974. Its most recent nuclear test has been done on 11 May 1998, when [[Operation Shakti]] (Pokhran-II) was initiated with the detonation of one [[Fusion bomb|fusion]] and three [[Fission bomb|fission]] bombs. On 13 May 1998, two additional fission devices were detonated. India, however, maintains a ''no-first use'' and a nuclear deterrence policy against nuclear adversaries. India's nuclear doctrine envisages building a credible minimum deterrent for maintaining a ''second strike capability'' which will be massive and designed to induce unacceptable damage on the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kanwal|first=Gurmeet|title=India's Nuclear Doctrine and Policy|url=http://www.idsa-india.org/an-feb-1.01.htm|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is one of only four nations in the world to possess a [[Nuclear triad|Nuclear Triad]]. India's nuclear missiles include the [[Prithvi missile|Prithvi]], the [[Agni missile system|Agni]], the [[Shaurya missile|Shaurya]], [[Sagarika (missile)|Sagarika]], Dhanush, and others. India conducted its first test with the [[Agni-V]], which can carry a nuclear warhead in the east as far as all of China and in the west deep into Europe with its 5000&amp;nbsp;km range, in April 2012 and a second test in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=None can intercept Agni-V: Chander|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/none-can-intercept-agniv-chander/article5139186.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agni-VI, with a perceived range of 6000–8000&amp;nbsp;km is also under development with features like [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Warheads]] (MIRVs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Agni-6 missile with multiple warheads likely by 2017|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/advanced-agni-6-missile-with-multiple-warheads-likely-by-2017-113050800034_1.html|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Subramanian|first=T.S.|title=Agni-VI all set to take shape|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/agnivi-all-set-to-take-shape/article4379416.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India also has bomber aircraft such as [[Tupolev Tu-142]] as well as fighter jets like [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]], [[Dassault Mirage 2000]], [[MiG-29]] and [[HAL Tejas]] capable of being armed with nuclear tipped bombs and missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/india/aircraft/index.html |title=India Aircraft Special Weapons Delivery Systems |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since India doesn't have a nuclear first use against an adversary, it becomes important to protect from a first strike. This protection is being developed in the form of the two layered [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme|Anti-ballistic missile defence]] system.

India's [[Strategic Nuclear Command]] controls its land-based nuclear warheads, while the Navy controls the ship and submarine based missiles and the Air Force the air based warheads. India's nuclear warheads are deployed in five areas:
# Ship based mobile, like [[Dhanush (missile)|Dhanush]]. (operational)
# Land-based mobile, like [[Agni missile system|Agni]]. (operational)
# Fixed underground silos (operational)
# Submarine based, like [[Sagarika (missile)|Sagarika]].

===India's nuclear doctrine===

India has a declared nuclear [[No first use|no-first-use]] policy and is in the process of developing a nuclear doctrine based on &quot;credible [[minimum deterrence]].&quot; In August 1999, the Indian government released a draft of the doctrine&lt;ref name=NFU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/CTBT/nuclear_doctrine_aug_17_1999.html |title=Draft Report of National Security Advisory Board on Indian Nuclear Doctrine |publisher=Indianembassy.org |accessdate=30 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205231912/http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/CTBT/nuclear_doctrine_aug_17_1999.html |archivedate=5 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which asserts that nuclear weapons are solely for deterrence and that India will pursue a policy of &quot;retaliation only&quot;. The document also maintains that India &quot;will not be the first to initiate a nuclear first strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail&quot;.&lt;ref name=NFU/&gt;

The fourth [[National Security Advisor (India)|National Security Advisor]] of India [[Shivshankar Menon]] signalled a significant shift from &quot;[[No first use]]&quot; to &quot;no first use against non-nuclear weapon states&quot; in a speech on the occasion of Golden Jubilee celebrations of [[National Defence College, India|National Defence College]] in New Delhi on 21 October 2010, a doctrine Menon said reflected India's &quot;strategic culture, with its emphasis on minimal deterrence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/798/Speech+by+NSA+Shri+Shivshankar+Menon+at+NDC+on+The+Role+of+Force+in+Strategic+Affairs|title=Speech by NSA Shri Shivshankar Menon at NDC on &quot;The Role of Force in Strategic Affairs&quot;|work=mea.gov.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether the policy shift actually took place or not is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/DidIndiaChangeitsNuclearDoctrine_vnarang_010311|title=Did India Change its Nuclear Doctrine?: Much Ado about Nothing|work=idsa.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argued that this was not a substantive change but &quot;an innocent typographical or lexical error in the text of the speech.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idsa.in/idsacomments/DidIndiaChangeitsNuclearDoctrine_vnarang_010311|title=Did India Change its Nuclear Doctrine?: Much Ado about Nothing|work=idsa.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's current PM Modi has in the run up to the recent general elections reiterated commitment to no first use policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/04/16/uk-india-election-nuclear-idINKBN0D20QB20140416|title=Modi says committed to no first use of nuclear weapons|work=Reuters India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013 [[Shyam Saran]], convener of the [[National Security Advisory Board]], affirmed that regardless of the size of a nuclear &quot;attack against India&quot;, be it a miniaturised version or a &quot;big&quot; missile, India will &quot;retaliate massively to inflict unacceptable damage&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bagchi |first=Indrani |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/even-a-midget-nuke-strike-will-lead-to-massive-retaliation-india-warns-pak/articleshow/19795988.cms |title=Even a midget nuke strike will lead to massive retaliation, India warns Pak – The Economic Times |work=The Economic Times |accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the term &quot;attack against India&quot; means attack against the &quot;Union of India&quot; or &quot;Indian forces anywhere&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idsa.in/cbwmagazine/IndiaResponsetoCBWAttack_aahmed_1008.html|title=India's Response to CBW attack|work=idsa.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missile defence programme==
{{main article|Guided missiles of India}}
[[India]]'s missile defence network has two principal components – the ''Air Defence Ground Environment System'' (ADGES) and the ''Base Air Defence Zones'' (BADZ). The ADGES network provides for wide area radar coverage and permits the detection and interception of most aerial incursions into Indian airspace. The BADZ system is far more concentrated with [[radars]], [[interceptor aircraft|interceptors]], [[Surface-to-air missile|SAMs]] and [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery|AAA]] units working in conjunction to provide an intense and highly effective defensive barrier to attacks on vital targets.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballistic Missile Defence for India|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Today/Contemporary/328-BMD.html|publisher=Bharat Rakshak|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ballistic missile defence===
[[File:AAD Test Crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Launching of [[Advanced Air Defence (AAD)]] missile]]
{{main article|Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Program}}

The Ballistic Missile Defence Program is an initiative to develop and deploy a multi-layered [[ballistic missile defence]] system to protect [[India]] from [[ballistic missile]] attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;IHT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Pollack |first=Andrew |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/04/asia/AS_GEN_India_Missile_System.php |title=India expects to use missile interception system as a weapon, top scientist says |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/03/stories/2006120312940100.htm |title=India developing new missiles Towards destroying hostile missiles |publisher=Hindu.com |date=3 December 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in light of the ballistic missile threat from [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiatoday.com/itoday/20061211/defence.shtml&amp;SET=T The New Guardian]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''India unveils an all new anti-ballistic missile expected to be the fore-runner of a sophisticated air defence system to thwart, among other threats, a [[Pakistan]]i nuclear weapons attack''&lt;/ref&gt; it is a double-tiered system consisting of two [[Anti-ballistic missile|interceptor missiles]], namely the [[Prithvi Air Defence|Prithvi Air Defence (PAD)]] missile for high-altitude interception, and the [[Advanced Air Defence (AAD)]] Missile for lower altitude interception. The two-tiered shield should be able to intercept any incoming missile launched 5,000 kilometres away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hF8vr43UZ29RmlnKWgtpAmQs81Lg |title=India tests interceptor missile |publisher=Google.com |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAD was tested in November 2006, followed by AAD in December 2007. With the test of the PAD missile, India became the fourth country to have successfully developed an Anti-ballistic missile system, after [[United States]], [[Russia]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Development of Ballistic Missile Defence System: Year End Review | publisher = [[Ministry of Defence (India)]] | date = 28 December 2007 | url = http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=34262 | accessdate = 26 January 2008 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 2009, India again successfully tested its missile defence shield, during which an incoming &quot;enemy&quot; missile was intercepted at an altitude of 75&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pollack |first=Andrew |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2009/03/06/asia/AS-India-Missile-Defense.php |title=India successfully tests missile interceptor |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cruise missile defence===
Defending against an attack by a cruise missile on the other hand is similar to tackling low-flying manned aircraft and hence most methods of aircraft defence can be used for a cruise missile defence system. To ward off the threats of nuke-tipped cruise missile attack India has a new missile defence programme which will be focused solely on intercepting cruise missiles. The technological breakthrough has been created with an Advanced Air Defence missile (AAD).&lt;ref name=IBNLIVE&gt;{{cite news|title=India discovers methods to face missile wars|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/missile-wars-india-prepares-itself-after-cruise-missile-tests-by-pak/54298-3.html|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=IBNLive|date=16 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DRDO Chief, Dr [[V K Saraswat]] stated in an Interview &quot;Our studies have indicated that this ''AAD'' will be able to handle a cruise missile intercept,&quot;&lt;ref name=IBNLIVE/&gt;

Furthermore, India is acquiring airborne radars like [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] to ensure detection of cruise missiles in order to stay on top of the threat.&lt;ref name=IBNLIVE/&gt;

[[Barak-8]] is a long-range anti-air and anti-missile naval defence system being developed jointly by [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] (IAI) and the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO) of India. The Indian Army is considering induction of a variant of Barak 8 missile to meet its requirement for a medium-range [[surface-to-air]] air defence missile. The naval version of this missile has the capability to intercept incoming enemy cruise missiles and combat jets targeting its warships at sea.&lt;ref name=IANS&gt;{{cite news|title=February trial for naval air defence missile|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/february-trial-naval-air-defence-missile-103543198.html|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=Indo-Asian News service|date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would also be inducted into the Indian Air Force, followed by the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lrsam-flighttested-successfully-in-israel/article6591545.ece|title=LRSAM flight tested successfully in Israel|author=Special Correspondent|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has a joint venture for this missile with Israel.&lt;ref name=NT&gt;{{cite news|title=Naval Barak-8 Missiles, Israel, India|url=http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/naval-barak-8-surface-air-missiles/|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=Naval Technology}}{{unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently developed, India's [[Akash (missile)|Akash]] missile defence system also has the capability to &quot;neutralise aerial targets like fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/akash-missile-successfully-test-fired-for-second-day/ Akash missile successfully test fired for second day, ''Dated:November 18, 2014'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-successfully-test-fires-medium-range-akash-missile-579358|title=India Successfully Test Fires Medium-Range Akash Missile|date=19 June 2014|work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Barak-8]] and [[Akash (missile)|Akash]] missile defence systems can simultaneously engage multiple targets during saturation attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAI PDF - Barak 8&quot;&gt;[http://www.iai.co.il/sip_storage/FILES/2/35042.pdf IAI PDF – Barak 8], iai.co.il&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military intelligence==
The [[Defence Intelligence Agency (India)|Defence Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) is an [[Intelligence agency|organisation]] responsible for providing and co-ordinating [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for the [[Indian armed forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Defence, Govt. of India|url=http://mod.nic.in/aboutus/body.htm|publisher=National Informatics Centre|accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA)|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/india/dia.htm|publisher=Global Security.org|accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in March 2002 and is administered within the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Union Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;/&gt; It is headed by a Director General who is also the principal adviser to the Minister of Defence and the Chief of Defence Staff.

Traditionally, the bulk of intelligence work in India has been carried out by the [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (R&amp;AW) and the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB). The various services intelligence directorates namely the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI), the Directorate of Air Intelligence (DAI), Directorate of Naval Intelligence (DNI) and some other agencies are involved also but their activity is smaller by comparison. The R&amp;AW and IB agencies are composed largely of civilians. Military personnel are often deputed to these agencies, but the letter of the law and concerns of deniability limit the use of serving military officers in some types of activity (especially collection and action). The creation of an intelligence agency co-ordinating the intelligence arms of the three military services had long been called for by senior Indian military officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;/&gt; It was formally recommended by the [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of India|Cabinet Group of Ministers]], headed by the then [[Deputy Prime Minister of India]] [[Lal Krishna Advani]]. The Group of Ministers investigated intelligence lapses that occurred during the [[Kargil War]] and recommended a comprehensive reform of [[List of Indian Intelligence agencies|Indian intelligence agencies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Defense Intelligence Agency to Start in February 2002|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/india/mod/dia.htm|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|date=30 January 2002|accessdate=14 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326002603/https://fas.org/irp/world/india/mod/dia.htm|archivedate=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Defence Intelligence Agency was created and became operational in March 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;A&quot;/&gt; As part of expanding bilateral co-operation on gathering intelligence and fighting terrorism, the [[United States military]] also provided advice to Indian military officers on the creation of the DIA.&lt;ref name=&quot;A&quot;/&gt;

DIA has control of MoD's prized technical intelligence assets&amp;nbsp;– the Directorate of Signals Intelligence and the Defence Image Processing and Analysis Centre (DIPAC). While the Signals Directorate is responsible for acquiring and decrypting enemy communications, the DIPAC controls India's satellite-based image acquisition capabilities. The DIA also controls the Defence Information Warfare Agency (DIWA) which handles all elements of the information warfare repertoire, including psychological operations, cyber-war, electronic intercepts and the monitoring of sound waves.

It was formed in 1958 by the merger of the Technical Development Establishment and the Directorate of Technical Development and Production with the Defence Science Organisation. DRDO has a network of 52 laboratories which are engaged in developing defence technologies covering various fields, like aeronautics, armaments, electronic and computer sciences, human resource development, life sciences, materials, missiles, combat vehicles development and naval research and development. The organisation includes more than 5,000 scientists and about 25,000 other scientific, technical and supporting personnel. Annual operating budget of DRDO is pegged at $1.6 billion (2011–12).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiastrategic.in/topstories960.htm|title=..:: India Strategic ::.. Indian Defence News: Indias Defence Budget 2011-12|work=indiastrategic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic-warfare, military hardware===
The DRDO's avionics programme has been a success story with its mission computers, [[radar warning receivers]], high accuracy direction finding pods, [[synthetic aperture radar]], [[Active Phased Array Radar]], airborne jammers and flight instrumentation in use across a wide variety of Indian Air Force aircraft and satellites. DRDO labs have developed many [[electronic warfare]] systems for IAF and Indian Army and high-performance [[Sonar]] systems for the Navy.

DRDO also developed other critical military hardware, such as the [[Arjun MBT|Arjun]] Main Battle Tank and is engaged in the development of the Future [[Infantry Combat Vehicle]], the &quot;Abhay&quot;. The DRDO is also a member of the trials teams for the T-72 upgrade and its fire control systems. [[INSAS]], India's de facto standard small arms family including [[assault rifle]], [[light machine guns]] and [[carbine]], is developed at [[Armament Research and Development Establishment]], a DRDO laboratory. ARDE also worked on the development of [[Pinaka Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher]], which has a maximum range of 39–40&amp;nbsp;km and can fire a salvo of 12 high-explosive rockets in 44 seconds, neutralising a target area of 3.9 square.km. This project was one of the first major Indian defence projects involving the Private sector.

===Missile development programme===
[[File:Nag with NAMICA Defexpo-2008.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|DRDO-built 3rd-generation [[ATGM]] [[Nag missile]]]]
DRDO executed [[Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme]] (IGMDP) to develop the ability to develop and design a missile locally, and manufacture a range of missile systems for the three defence services. The programme has seen significant success in its two most important constituents&amp;nbsp;— the [[Agni (missile)|Agni missiles]] and the [[Prithvi (missile)|Prithvi missiles]], while two other programmes, the [[Akash SAM]] and the anti-tank [[Nag Missile]] have seen significant orders. Another significant project of DRDO has been [[Astra (missile)|Astra]] [[Beyond-visual-range missile|beyond-visual-range]] air-to-air missile (BVR), for equipping IAF's [[Air superiority fighter|air-superiority fighters]]. The crown jewel of DRDO has been the [[BrahMos]] programme (as a joint venture with Russian NPO), which aims at creating a range of [[Cruise missile|supersonic cruise missile]] derived from the [[Yakhont]] system. The DRDO has been responsible for the navigational systems on the BrahMos, aspects of its propulsion, airframe and seeker, Fire Control Systems, Mobile Command posts and Transporter Erector Launcher.

The US Department of Defence ([[Department of Defense (USA)|Pentagon]]) has written to India's Ministry of Defence (MoD), proposing the two countries collaborate in jointly developing a next-generation version of the [[Javelin anti-tank missile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shukla|first=Ajai|title=US offers to co-develop new Javelin missile with India|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/us-offers-to-co-develop-new-javelin-missile-with-india-113091600624_1.html|work=Business Standard|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unmanned aerial vehicles===
[[File:Rustom RC model1.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|A scaled-down model of the [[DRDO Rustom|Rustom-1]] MALE UAV.]]
The DRDO has also developed many [[unmanned aerial vehicles]]- such as the ''[[DRDO Nishant|Nishant]]'' tactical UAV and the ''[[Lakshya PTA|Lakshya]]'' Pilotless Target Aircraft (PTA). The Lakshya PTA has been ordered by all three services for their gunnery target training requirements. Efforts are on to develop the PTA further, with an improved all-digital flight control system, and a better turbojet engine. The DRDO is also going ahead with its plans to develop a new class of UAVs, referred to by the HALE (High Altitude Long Endurance) and MALE (Medium Altitude Long Endurance) designations. The MALE UAV has been tentatively named the [[DRDO Rustom|Rustom]], and will feature canards and carry a range of payloads, including optronic, radar, laser designators and ESM. The UAV will have conventional landing and take off capability. The HALE UAV will have features such as SATCOM links, allowing it to be commanded beyond line of sight. Other tentative plans speak of converting the LCA into a UCAV ([[unmanned combat aerial vehicle]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India to develop unmanned combat aerial vehicle|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/india-to-develop-unmanned-combat-aerial-vehicle/105939-3.html|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and weaponising UAVs such as [[DRDO AURA|AURA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India developing unmanned combat aerial vehicle|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-developing-unmanned-combat-aerial-vehicle/1/100966.html|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future programmes===

====Anti-satellite weapon====
{{main article|Anti-satellite weapon}}
The defence ministry in 2010 had drafted a 15-year &quot;Technology Perspective and Roadmap&quot;, which held development of [[Anti-satellite weapon|ASAT weapons]] &quot;''for electronic or physical destruction of satellites in both LEO (2,000-km altitude above earth's surface) and the higher geosynchronous orbit''&quot; as a thrust area in its long-term integrated perspective plan under the management of DRDO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rajat Pandit, TNN, 25 May 2010, 02.00am IST |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/India-to-gear-up-for-star-wars/articleshow/5970384.cms |title=India to gear up for 'star wars' – India&amp;nbsp;— The Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=25 May 2010 |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 10 February 2010, [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] Director-General and Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister, Dr VK Saraswat stated that India had &quot;all the building blocks necessary&quot; to integrate an anti-satellite weapon to neutralise hostile satellites in [[Low Earth Orbit|low earth]] and [[polar orbit]]s. India is known to have been developing an exo-atmospheric kill vehicle that can be integrated with the missile to engage satellites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defencenow.com/news/343/india-contemplates-anti-satellite-vehicle-integration-with-agni-iii-ballistic-missile.html date= 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Directed-energy weapons====
It is also known that DRDO is working on a slew of [[directed energy weapons]] (DEWs) and has identified DEWs, along with space security, cyber-security, and hypersonic vehicles/missiles as focus areas in the next 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDOs-next-Star-Wars-like-weapons/articleshow/6248942.cms?|title=DRDO's next: Star Wars-like weapons|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle====

Indian Army has also contributed lady officers as Military Observers and Staff Officers apart from them forming part of Medical Units being deployed in UN Missions. The first all women contingent in peacekeeping mission, a Formed Police Unit from India, was deployed in 2007 to the UN Operation in Liberia(UNMIL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/contributors/2007/march07_2.pdf Ranking of Military and Police Contributions to UN Operations]&lt;/ref&gt; It also suffered 127 soldier deaths while serving on peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/fatalities/StatsByYear%201.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326080655/http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/fatalities/StatsByYear%201.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; India also provided army contingent performing a peacekeeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990 as [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] and in November 1988, India also helped restore government of [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] in [[Maldives]] under [[Operation Cactus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.pk/forums/india-defence/71886-indian-navy-destroyer-anti-piracy-action-sept-5-a.html|title=Indian Navy Destroyer In Anti-Piracy Action On Sept 5|work=Pakistan Defence}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2013, about 8000 Indian UN peacekeepers, both men and women, are deployed in nine missions, including Congo, South Sudan, Liberia, UNDOF, Haiti, Lebanon, Abeyi, Cyprus and Cote de Ivoire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuteja&quot;/&gt;

===Anti-piracy mission===
India sought to augment its naval force in the Gulf of Aden by deploying the larger [[INS Mysore (D60)|INS ''Mysore'']] to patrol the area. Somalia also added India to its list of states, including the US and France, who are permitted to enter its territorial waters, extending up to {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|lk=in}} from the coastline, in an effort to check piracy.&lt;ref name=ins-hp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/india-gets-the-right-of-hot-pursuit-in-somali-waters/78607-3.html?from=rssfeed |title=India gets the right of hot pursuit in Somali waters |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date= |accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Indian naval official confirmed receipt of a letter acceding to India's prerogative to check such piracy. &quot;We had put up a request before the Somali government to play a greater role in suppressing piracy in the Gulf of Aden in view of the United Nations resolution.

===Relief operations===
[[File:Indian Air Force Cheetah helicopters rescue op 2015 Chennai Flood.jpg|thumb|An [[Indian Air Force]] helicopter rescues stranded people during [[2015 South Indian floods#Chennai|2015 Chennai Floods]].]]
Indian Air Force provides regular relief operation for food and medical facility around the world by its [[cargo aircraft]] most notably [[Ilyushin Il-76]]. The most recent relief operation of the IAF was in [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/indian-aid-flown-to-kyrgyzstan-news-national-khgruccjede.html |title=Indian aid flown to Kyrgyzstan |publisher=Sify.com |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-sends-aid-to-Kyrgyzstan/Article1-565986.aspx |title=India sends aid to Kyrgyzstan |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[2010 Ladakh floods]], two Ilyushin Il-76 and four Antonov-32 aircraft of the IAF carried 30 tonnes of load, which include 125 rescue and relief personnel, medicines, generators, tents, portable X-ray machines and emergency rescue kits. A MI-17 helicopter and Cheetah helicopter were pressed to increase effectiveness of the rescue operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=80 foreigners rescued from Leh: IAF|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2010/aug/10/80-foreigners-rescued-from-leh-iaf-41.asp|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During 2013 [[2013 North India floods|Uttrakhand Floods]], Indian armed forces demonstrated heroic courage in rescue operations. By 21 June 2013, the Army had deployed 10,000 soldiers and 11 helicopters, the Navy had sent 45 naval divers, and the Air force had deployed 43 aircraft including 36 helicopters. From 17 to 30 June 2013, the IAF airlifted a total of 18,424 people&amp;nbsp;— flying a total of 2,137 sorties and dropping/landing a total of 3,36,930&amp;nbsp;kg of relief material and equipment. The IAF participated in the rescue operation codenamed ''[[Operation Raahat]]'' and evacuated more than 4640 Indian citizens along with 960 foreign nationals belonged to 41 countries from [[Yemen]] during the [[2015 military intervention in Yemen|2015 military intervention]] by [[Saudi Arabia]] and its allies in that country during the [[Yemeni Crisis (2011–present)|Yemeni Crisis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kumar 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Kumar | first=Hari | title=India Concludes Evacuation of Its Citizens From Yemen | website=NYTimes.com | date=10 April 2015  | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/world/asia/india-concludes-evacuation-of-its-citizens-from-yemen.html?nytmobile=0 | accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=onein2015&gt;{{cite web | title=India evacuates 4,640 nationals, 960 others from Yemen | website=www.oneindia.com | date=10 April 2015  | url=http://www.oneindia.com/india/india-evacuates-4640-nationals-960-others-from-yemen-1711703.html | accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=India appreciates Pakistan's gesture of evacuating its nationals from Yemen | website=The Times of India | date=8 April 2015  | url=http://m.timesofindia.com/india/India-appreciates-Pakistans-gesture-of-evacuating-its-nationals-from-Yemen/articleshow/46852396.cms | accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zee Newsx2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Yemen crisis: Number of Indian evacuees reach 4000 mark | website=Zee News | date=7 April 2015 | url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/yemen-crisis-number-of-indian-evacuees-reach-4000-mark_1574979.html | accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.hindustantimes.com/ 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=4,000 Indians rescued so far, Yemen air evacuation op to end on Wed | website=http://www.hindustantimes.com/ | date=7 April 2015  | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-000-indians-rescued-so-far-yemen-air-evacuation-op-to-end-on-wed/article1-1334906.aspx | accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times of India15&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=India evacuates 232 foreigners including Americans, Europeans from Yemen | website=The Times of India| date=7 April 2015 | url=http://m.timesofindia.com/india/India-evacuates-232-foreigners-including-Americans-Europeans-from-Yemen/articleshow/46839994.cms | accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IAF efforts in eclipse study===
The Indian Air Force successfully undertook sorties to help Indian scientists study the total solar eclipse that took place on 23 July 2010. Two separate missions from Agra and Gwalior were flown along the path of the moon's shadow, a mission that was deemed hugely successful by scientists associated with the experiment. While one [[Antonov An-32|AN-32]] transport aircraft carrying scientific equipment, cameras and scientists that took off from Agra landed back after a three-hour flight, a [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage-2000]] trainer from Gwalior took spectacular images of the celestial spectacle from 40,000 feet. With weather being clear at such altitudes and coordinates planned by the IAF pilots, both AN-32 and Mirage-2000 pilots were able to accomplish the mission successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=56489 |title=PIB Press Release |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Navy exploration===
[[File:Indian Navy at the North Pole.jpg|thumb|The Indian Navy expedition to [[North Pole]], 2008]]
The Indian Navy regularly conducts adventure expeditions. The sailing ship and training vessel INS Tarangini began circumnavigating the world on 23 January 2003, intending to foster good relations with various other nations; she returned to India in May of the following year after visiting 36 ports in 18 nations. Lt. Cdr. M.S. Kohli led the Indian Navy's first successful expedition to Mount Everest in 1965. Another Navy team also successfully scaled Everest from the north face, the technically more challenging route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Navy on top of the world|url=http://www.chennaionline.com/columns/variety/05navy.asp|accessdate=2 October 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Indian Navy team comprising 11 members successfully completed an expedition to the [[North Pole]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chilling Out!|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2006/08/19/stories/2006081902510100.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029075128/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2006/08/19/stories/2006081902510100.htm|archivedate=29 October 2010|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Naval ensign first flew in Antarctica in 1981.

==Misconceptions in Nomenclature of forces==
There are number of uniform forces in India apart from Indian Armed Forces. All such forces are established under the acts of Parliament. They are [[Central Reserve Police Force]], [[Border Security Force]], [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]], [[Central Industrial Security Force]], [[Sashastra Seema Bal]], [[Assam Rifles]], [[National Security Guard]] under [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)]]; [[Special Protection Group]] under [[Cabinet Secretariat of India]], [[Railway Protection Force]] under [[Ministry of Railways (India)]]; [[Indian Coast Guard]] under [[Ministry of Defence (India)]]. All these forces are referred as &quot;Armed Force of the Union&quot; in their respective acts which mean a force with armed capability and necessarily not &quot;Armed Forces&quot; the term as per international standards and conventionally referred to Army, Navy and Air Force. Supreme court in its judgements reported in AIR 1996 SC 1705 held that the military service is only confined to three principal wings of the armed forces  i.e. Army, Navy and Air Force. Further the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in case reported in AIR 2000 SC 3948 clarified that unless it is a service in the three principal wing of Armed forces, a force included in the expression &quot;Armed forces of the Union&quot; does not constitute part of military service/military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIC order|url=http://www.rti.india.gov.in/cic_decisions/CIC_LS_A_2010_001190_M_42637.pdf|website=Right to Information|publisher=CIC, GoI|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To differentiate from Armed Forces, Some of other forces were commonly referred as Central Paramilitary Forces which caused confusion and giving an impression of being part of Military forces.

To remove such confusion, In the year 2011, Ministry of Home Affairs adopted a uniform nomenclature of [[Central Armed Police Forces]] for only five of its Primary Police organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office Memorandum|url=http://www.mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/OM2-020513.pdf|website=MHA|publisher=MHA, GoI|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For the paramilitary, all's in a new name|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110326/jsp/nation/story_13768094.jsp|website=The Telegrpah|publisher=The Telegraph Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were formerly called as Paramilitary Forces. [[Central Armed Police Forces]] are still incorrectly referred as 'Paramilitary Forces' in media and in some correspondences. These forces are headed by officers from the [[Indian Police Service]] and are under the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]].

Other uniform services are referred to by its name only such as Railway Protection Force, NSG, SPG, Indian Coast Guard, Assam Rifles etc. but not under any collective nomenclature. However conventionally some forces are referred as [[Paramilitary Forces of India]] i.e. Assam Rifles, SFF, ICG

[[Indian Coast Guard]] is often confused incorrectly as a part of Military forces due to the organisation being under Ministry of Defence, mentioned as Armed Force of the Union in ICG act &amp; its white uniform. Supreme court in its judgement has held that unless it is a service in the three principal wing of Armed forces, a force included in the expression &quot;Armed forces of the Union&quot; does not constitute part of military service/military. Indian Coast Guard works closely with civilian agencies such as Customs, Dept of Fisheries, Coastal Police etc. with its primary role being non military nature of maritime law enforcement &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.indiancoastguard.nic.in/Indiancoastguard/mission/mission.html|publisher=Indian Coast Guard|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed History of Indian Coast Guard [ In Detail ]|url=http://www.indiancoastguard.nic.in/Indiancoastguard/history/morehistory.html|website=Indian Coast Guard|publisher=ICG|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is independent of Command and Control of Indian Navy. ICG was initially planned to be kept under Ministry of Home Affairs but has been kept under Ministry of Defence since it is patterned like Navy and for better synergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICG More History|url=http://www.indiancoastguard.nic.in/Indiancoastguard/history/morehistory.html|website=ICG|publisher=Indian Coast Guard|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICG do not take part in any protocol of Military forces such as President's Body Guard, ADCs, Tri-Services Guard of Honour etc. Their recruitment is also not under Combined Defence Services Exam/National Defence Academy Exam which is one of the prime modes of commissioning officers to Armed Forces. Indian Coast Guard Officers continue to get their training with Indian Navy Officers due to not having their own training academy. Already a new [[Indian Coast Guard Academy]] for training of their officers is under construction. Often ICG loses its credit for being incorrectly recognised as part of Indian military Forces but not as a unique independent force.
