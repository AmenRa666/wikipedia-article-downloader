{{Polish Underground State sidebar}}
The '''Home Army''' ({{lang-pl|Armia Krajowa}}; {{IPA-pl|ˈarmʲa kraˈjɔva}}, abbreviated '''AK''') was the dominant [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]] in [[History of Poland (1939–45)|Poland]] occupied by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II.  It was formed in February 1942 from the ''[[Związek Walki Zbrojnej]]'' (Armed Resistance).  Over the next two years, it absorbed most other [[Polish partisans|Polish underground forces]].  Its allegiance was to the [[Polish Government-in-Exile]], and it constituted the armed wing of what became known as the &quot;[[Polish Underground State]]&quot;.

Estimates of the Home Army's 1944 strength range between 200,000 and 600,000, the most commonly cited number being 400,000.  This last number would make the Home Army not only the largest Polish underground [[resistance movement]] but one of the three largest in Europe during World War II.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}  The Home Army was disbanded on 19 January 1945, after the Soviet [[Red Army]] had largely cleared [[Polish territory]] of German forces.

The Home Army [[sabotage]]d German operations such as transports headed for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the Soviet Union.  It also fought several full-scale [[battle]]s against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and in [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944.  The Home Army, in support of the Soviet military effort, tied down substantial German forces and destroyed much-needed German supplies.

The most widely known Home Army operation was the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]].  The Army also defended Polish civilians against [[ethnic violence|atrocities]] perpetrated by German and collaborationist non-German militaries.

Because the Home Army was loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an obstacle to a Soviet takeover of Poland. Consequently, over the course of the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces.

==History and operations==

===World War II===
[[File:Band of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa).PNG|left|thumb|Armband worn by Home Army soldiers]]

The Home Army originated in the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (''Służba Zwycięstwu Polski''), which General [[Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] set up on 27 September 1939, just as the coordinated [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasions of Poland]] neared completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt; Seven weeks later, on 17 November 1939, on the orders of General [[Władysław Sikorski]], the Service for Poland's Victory was superseded by the [[Union for Armed Struggle|Armed Resistance]] (''Związek Walki Zbrojnej''), which in turn, a little over two years later, on 14 February 1942, became the &quot;Home Army&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-PWN&quot;/&gt; All the while, however, many other resistance organizations remained active in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;PolAKhist&quot;/&gt; Most of them eventually merged with the Armed Resistance or with its successor, the Home Army, between 1939 and 1944, substantially augmenting the Home Army's numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-PWN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PolAKhist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cienc-lect&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Warsaw Uprising boyscouts.jpg|thumb|[[Boy Scout | Boy-scout]] Home Army soldiers during the [[Warsaw Uprising]]]]
The [[Polish Government in Exile]] envisioned the Home Army as an apolitical, nationwide resistance organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; The supreme command defined the Home Army's chief tasks as partisan warfare against the German occupiers, re-creation of armed forces underground and, near the end of the German occupation, a general armed rising to be prosecuted until victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-PWN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; Home Army plans envisioned, at war's end, the seizure of [[power (sociology)|power]] in Poland by the [[Government Delegation for Poland]] (the ''Delegatura'') and by the Government in Exile itself, which expected to return to Poland.

In addition to the Polish government in London, a political organization operated in Poland itself - a deliberative body of the resistance and of the [[Polish Underground State]]. The [[Political Consultative Committee]] (''Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy'')  formed in 1940 pursuant to an agreement between several major political parties:  the [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]], [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] and [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labor Party]].  In 1943 it was renamed to [[Home Political Representation]] (''Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna'') and in 1944 to [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedności Narodowej'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie235-236&quot;/&gt;

The Home Army, though in theory subordinate to the civil authorities and to the Government in Exile, often acted somewhat independently, with neither the Home Army's commanders in Poland nor the &quot;London government&quot; fully aware of the others' situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie235-236&quot;/&gt;

After [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany started its invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union joined the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]] and signed an [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] on 12 July 1941. This put the Polish Government in a difficult position, since it had previously pursued a policy of &quot;two enemies&quot;.  Though a [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement|Polish-Soviet agreement]] was signed in August 1941, cooperation continued to be difficult and deteriorated further after 1943 when Nazi Germany publicized the [[Katyn massacre]] of 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Eagle: The Army in Polish Politics, 1944-1988&quot;/&gt;

Until the major rising in 1944, the Home Army concentrated on self-defense (the freeing of prisoners and hostages, defense against German pacification operations) and on attacks against German forces. Home Army units carried out thousands of armed raids and intelligence operations, sabotaged hundreds of railway shipments, and participated in many [[partisan (military)|partisan]] clashes and battles with German police and [[Wehrmacht]] units. The Home Army also assassinated prominent [[Collaboration during World War II|Nazi collaborators]] and [[Gestapo]] officials in retaliation against Nazi terror inflicted on Poland's civilian population; prominent individuals assassinated by the Home Army included [[Igo Sym]] (1941) and [[Franz Kutschera]] (1944).&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt;

====Intelligence====
[[File:The Third Reich - polish resistance poster, German-occupied Poland, 1943.jpg|thumb|''Der Klabautermann'' (an [[Operation N]] magazine), 3 January 1943 issue, satirizing [[Third Reich]] Nazi terror and genocide. ''At right, emerging from the ''III'' (&quot;Three&quot;, of &quot;Third Reich&quot;)'': [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]].]]

The Home Army supplied valuable [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] to the Allies; 43% of all reports received by the [[British secret services]] from continental Europe in between 1939 and 1945 came from Polish sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;FT06&quot;/&gt; Until 1942 most British intelligence on Germany came from Home Army reports.  Until the end of the war, the Home Army remained Britain's main source of news from Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suchcitz&quot;/&gt;

[[Home Army intelligence]] provided the Allies with information on [[German concentration camps]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Whatfor&quot;/&gt; and on [[Home Army and V1 and V2|the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cienc-lect&quot;/&gt; In one [[Project Big Ben]] mission ([[Operation Most III|Operation Wildhorn III]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Wildhorn&quot;/&gt; Polish [[cryptonym]]: ''Most III'', &quot;Bridge III&quot;), a stripped-for-lightness RAF twin-engine [[Douglas Dakota|Dakota]] flew from [[Brindisi]] in [[Italy]] to an abandoned German airfield in Poland to pick up intelligence prepared by Polish aircraft-designer [[Antoni Kocjan]], including {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}} of [[V-2 rocket]] wreckage from a [[Peenemünde]] launch, a ''Special Report 1/R, no. 242'', photographs, eight key V-2 parts, and drawings of the wreckage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kocjan&quot;/&gt;

Sabotage was coordinated by the [[Union of Retaliation]] and later by ''[[Wachlarz]]'' and ''[[Kedyw]]'' units.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-PWN&quot;/&gt;

The Home Army also conducted [[psychological warfare]].  Its &quot;[[Operation N]]&quot; created the illusion of a German movement of opposition to Hitler within Germany itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt;

====Major operations====
[[File:26PPAK relief Warsaw Uprising.jpg|thumb|Home Army 26th Infantry Regiment marching from [[Kielce]]-[[Radom]] area in an attempt to join the [[Warsaw Uprising]]]]

Major Home Army military and sabotage operations included: 

* the [[Zamość Uprising|Zamość Rising]] of 1942–43, with the Home Army sabotaging German plans to [[Expulsion of Poles by Germany#Zamość|expel Poles]] under ''[[Generalplan Ost]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-PWN&quot;/&gt;
* protection of the Polish population from the [[massacres of Poles in Volhynia]] in 1943–44&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-PWN&quot;/&gt;
* [[Operation Wieniec|Operation Garland]], in 1942, sabotaging German rail transport&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-PWN&quot;/&gt;
* [[Operation Taśma|Operation Ribbon]] in 1943, a series of attacks on German border outposts on the frontier between the [[General Government]] and the territories annexed by Germany
* [[Operation Jula]], in 1944, another rail-sabotage operation&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-PWN&quot;/&gt;
* most notably [[Operation Tempest]], in 1944, a series of nationwide risings which aimed primarily to seize control of cities and areas where German forces were preparing  defenses against the Soviet Red Army, so that Polish underground civil authorities could take power before the arrival of Soviet forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burza-PWN&quot;/&gt;

The largest and best-known of the Operation Tempest battles, the [[Warsaw Uprising]], constituted an attempt, beginning on 1 August 1944, to liberate Poland's capital.  Polish forces took control of substantial parts of the city and resisted the German-led forces until 2 October (a total of 63 days).  With the Poles receiving no aid from the approaching Red Army, the Germans eventually defeated the insurrectionists and burned the city, finally quelling the Uprising on 2 October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt; Other major Home Army city risings included [[Operation Ostra Brama]], in [[Wilno]], and the [[Lwów Uprising]].  The Home Army also prepared for a [[Kraków Uprising (1944)|rising in Kraków]], but due to several circumstances it was canceled. While the Home Army managed to liberate a number of places from German control—for example in the [[Lublin]] area, where regional structures were able to set up a functioning government—ultimately, due to Soviet hostility, the Home Army failed to secure sufficient territory to enable the Government in Exile to return to Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-PWN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burza-PWN&quot;/&gt;

Estimates of Axis fatalities due to operations by the Polish underground, of which the Home Army formed the bulk, range up to 150,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Taras&quot;/&gt; (however, estimates of [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]-inflicted casualties often have a wide margin of error&lt;ref name=&quot;Laqueur&quot;/&gt;). The Home Army primarily focused on [[sabotage]] of German rail- and road-transports to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cienc-lect&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RJC&quot;/&gt; It is estimated{{by whom?|date=November 2015}} that an eighth of all German transports to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were destroyed or substantially delayed due to Home Army  operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;RJC&quot;/&gt; The Poles' [[battle]]s with the Germans, particularly in 1943 and 1944, tied down several German [[division (military)|divisions]] (upper estimates suggest a total of some 930,000 German soldiers).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cienc-lect&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pogonowski&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Moscow Trial 1945.jpg|thumb|June 1945 [[Moscow]] show [[Trial of the Sixteen|trial of 16 leaders of the Polish wartime underground movement]] (including Home Army and civil authorities), who were convicted of &quot;drawing up plans for military action against the U.S.S.R.&quot; They  had been invited in March 1945 to help organize a Polish Government of National Unity and had been immediately arrested by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[NKVD]]. Despite the court's lenience, 6 years later only two were still alive.]]

The Home Army was officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 to avoid civil war and armed conflict with the Soviets.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNKcited&quot;/&gt; However, many former Home Army units decided to continue operations. The Soviet Union, and the [[Polish communist|Polish Communist Government]] that it controlled, viewed the underground, still loyal to the [[Polish Government-in-Exile]], as a force to be extirpated before they could gain complete control of Poland. Future [[Secretary General]] of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], [[Władysław Gomułka]], is quoted as saying: &quot;Soldiers of the AK are a hostile element which must be removed without mercy.&quot; Another prominent Polish communist, [[Roman Zambrowski]], said that the Home Army had to be &quot;exterminated.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt;

The first Home Army structure designed primarily to deal with the Soviet threat had been ''[[NIE (resistance)|NIE]]'', formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how to deal with the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 ''NIE'' (&quot;NO&quot;) was disbanded&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt; and transformed into an [[Armed Forces Delegation for Poland]] (''Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj''); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt;

The first Polish communist government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]], formed in July 1944, declined to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore for over a year [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agencies such as the [[NKVD]] took responsibility for disarming the Home Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt; By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet [[Gulag]]s and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, [[Operation Tempest]], when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt; Other Home Army veterans were arrested when they approached Polish communist government officials after having been promised [[amnesty]]. After a number of such broken promises during the first few years of communist control, Home Army soldiers stopped trusting the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt;

The third post-Home Army organization was ''[[Wolność i Niezawisłość]]'' (''WiN'':  Freedom and Independence).  Its primary goal was not combat, either. Rather, it was designed to help Home Army soldiers transition from partisan to civilian life; while secrecy was necessary in the light of increasing persecution of Home Army veterans by the communist government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Korboński&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Stefan Korboński]] |title=Warsaw in Chains |year=1959 |editor= |pages=112–123 |chapter= | chapterurl = |publisher=Macmillan Publishing |location=New York |id= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''WiN'' was, however, in great need of funds, necessary to pay for false documents and to provide resources for the partisans, many of whom had lost their homes and life's savings in the war. Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, ''WiN'' was far from efficient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt; A major victory for the Soviet [[NKVD]] and the newly created Polish secret police, ''[[Urząd Bezpieczeństwa]]'' (''UB''), came in the second half of 1945, when they managed to convince several Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders that they truly wanted to offer [[amnesty]] to Home Army members. Over a few months they gained information about great numbers of Home Army and ''WiN'' people and resources. By the time the (imprisoned) Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders realized their mistake, the organizations had been crippled, with thousands of their members arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt; ''WiN'' was finally disbanded in 1952. By 1947 a colonel of the communist forces declared that &quot;The terrorist and political underground has ceased to be a threatening force, though there are still men of the forests&quot; to be dealt with.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Krzyz AK 64081946chl.jpg|thumb|[[Armia Krajowa Cross|Home Army Cross]], awarded to Home Army veterans by the [[Polish Government-in-Exile]]]]

The persecution of the Home Army was only part of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repressions in Poland. In the period 1944–56, some 2 million people were arrested,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt; over 20,000, including the hero of [[Auschwitz]], [[Witold Pilecki]], were executed or murdered in communist prisons,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt; and 6 million Polish citizens (every third adult Pole) were classified as  &quot;reactionary&quot; or &quot;criminal elements&quot; and subjected to spying by state agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt;

Most Home Army soldiers were captured by the [[NKVD]] or by Poland's ''[[Urzad Bezpieczenstwa|UB]]'' political police. They were interrogated and imprisoned on various charges such as &quot;fascism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paczkowski&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michał Zając, ''[http://www.polskieradio.pl/zagranica/dokument.aspx?iid=39960 Warsaw Uprising: 5 pm, 1 August 1944]'', Retrieved on 4 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Many were sent to [[Gulag]]s, executed or &quot;disappeared.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paczkowski&quot;/&gt; Thus, between 1944 and 1956 all the members of ''[[Batalion Zośka]]'', which had fought in the [[Warsaw Uprising]], were locked up in communist prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Żołnierze Batalionu Armii Krajowej &quot;Zośka&quot; represjonowani w latach 1944–1956,&quot; Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, Warszawa 2008, ISBN 978-83-60464-92-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 an amnesty released 35,000 former Home Army soldiers from prisons:  some had spent over 10 years  imprisoned for the crime of fighting for their country.

Even then, however, some partisans remained in the countryside, unwilling or unable to rejoin the community; they became known as the ''[[cursed soldiers]]''. Stanisław Marchewka &quot;Ryba&quot; was killed in 1957, and the last AK partisan, [[Józef Franczak]] &quot;Lalek,&quot; was killed in 1963&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– almost 2 decades after World War II had ended. It was only four years later, in 1967, that [[Adam Boryczka]], a soldier of AK and a member of the elite, Britain-trained [[Cichociemny]] (&quot;Silent Unseen&quot;) intelligence and support group, was released from prison. Until the end of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], Home Army soldiers remained under investigation by the secret police, and it was only in 1989, after the [[fall of communism]], that the sentences of Home Army soldiers were finally declared null and void by Polish courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt;

Many monuments to the Home Army have since been erected in Poland, including the Polish Underground State and Home Army Monument near the [[Sejm]] building in Warsaw, unveiled in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polska.newsweek.pl/panstwo-podziemne-jest-wzorem-dla-wspolczesnych,62725,1,1.html |title=Państwo Podziemne było fenomenem na skalę światową – Polska – Newsweek.pl |publisher=Polska.newsweek.pl |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puszka.waw.pl/pomnik_polskiego_panstwa_podziemnego_i_armii_krajowej-projekt-pl-788.html |title=Pomnik Polskiego Państwa Podziemnego i Armii Krajowej / pomnik / Jerzy Staniszkis |language=pl |publisher=Puszka.waw.pl |date= |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Home Army is also commemorated in the [[Armia Krajowa Museum in Kraków|Home Army Museum in Kraków]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muzeum-ak.krakow.pl/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Warsaw Uprising Museum]] in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1944.pl/ |title=Muzeum Powstania Warszawskiego |publisher=1944.pl |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1942, when the Home Army was formed from the [[Związek Walki Zbrojnej|Armed Resistance]], it numbered some 100,000 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; Less than a year later, at the start of 1943, it had reached a strength of some 200,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; In the summer of 1944, when [[Operation Tempest]] began, the Home Army reached its highest membership.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; Estimates of membership in the first half and summer of 1944 range from 200,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie234&quot;/&gt; through 300,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;PAFiWWIIpdf&quot;/&gt; 380,000&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; and 400,000 to &lt;ref name=&quot;Cienc-lect&quot;/&gt; 450,000–500,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salm317&quot;/&gt; Most estimates average at about 400,000. The strength estimates vary due to the constantly ongoing integration of other resistance organizations into the Home Army; and due to the fact that, while the number of members was high and that of sympathizers was much higher still, the number of armed members participating in operations was smaller due to insufficient number of weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Laqueur&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie234&quot;/&gt;

Home Army numbers in 1944 include a cadre of over 10,000–11,000 officers, 7,500 officers-in-training (singular: ''[[podchorąży]]'') and 88,000 [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs).&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; The officer cadre was formed from prewar officers and NCOs, graduates of underground courses, and elite operatives usually parachuted in from the West (the [[Silent Unseen]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt;  The basic organizational unit was the platoon, numbering 35–50 people, with a skeleton unmobilized version of 16–25; in February 1944 the Home Army had 6,287 regular and 2,613 skeleton platoons operational.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; Such numbers made the Home Army not only the largest Polish resistance movement, but one of the two largest in World War II Europe {{Ref label|a|a|none}}. Casualties during the war are estimated at about 34,000&lt;ref name=&quot;PAFiWWIIpdf&quot;/&gt;-100,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; plus some 20,000&lt;ref name=&quot;PAFiWWIIpdf&quot;/&gt;-50,000&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; after the war (casualties and imprisonment).

{{quote|Within the framework of the entire enemy intelligence operations directed against Germany, the intelligence service of the Polish resistance movement assumed major significance.

The Poles under German Occupation 1939–1944&quot; Richard C. Lukas Hippocrene Books New York 1997, ISBN 0-7818-0901-0&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Home Army was intended as a mass organization, formed around a core of prewar officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; Home Army soldiers fell into three groups. The first two consisted of &quot;full-time members&quot;: undercover operatives, living mostly in urban settings under false identities (most senior Home Army officers belonged to this group); and uniformed (to a certain extent) partisans, living in forested regions (see &quot;[[leśni|forest people]]&quot;), who openly fought the Germans (the forest people are estimated at some 40 groups, numbering 1,200–4,000 persons in early 1943, but their numbers grew substantially during [[Operation Tempest]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie234-235&quot;/&gt; The third, largest group were &quot;part-time members&quot;:  sympathizers who led &quot;double lives&quot; under their real names in their real homes, received no payment for their services, stayed in touch with their undercover unit commanders but were seldom mustered for operations, as the Home Army planned to use them only during a planned nationwide rising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie234-235&quot;/&gt;

The Home Army was intended to be representative of the Polish nation, its members being recruited from all parties and social classes (the only notable exception being communists sent by the Soviets, and the Soviet-created [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie235-236&quot;/&gt; The Home Army's growth was largely based on integrating, into its ranks, scores of smaller resistance organizations. Most other Polish underground armed organizations were incorporated into the Home Army (though they retained varying degrees of autonomy).&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-PWN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cienc-lect&quot;/&gt; The largest organization merged into the Home Army was the leftist ''[[Bataliony Chłopskie]]'' (Peasants' Battalions), about 1943-44.&lt;ref name=WPH&gt;{{cite book|title=Wojskowy przegla̜d historyczny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xFJpAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=s.n.|page=134|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the ''[[Narodowe Siły Zbrojne]]'' (National Armed Forces) also came to be subordinated to the Home Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;KonopkaKonopka1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hanna Konopka|author2=Adrian Konopka|title=Leksykon historii Polski po II wojnie światowej 1944-1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqe1AAAAIAAJ|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Graf-Punkt|isbn=978-83-87988-08-1|page=130|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, individual Home Army units varied substantially in their political outlooks (notably in their attitudes toward ethnic minorities and toward the Soviets).&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie235-236&quot;/&gt; The largest group that completely refused to join the Home Army was the pro-Soviet, communist [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]], which at its height in 1944 numbered 30,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;AL-PWN&quot;/&gt;

==Structure==
Home Army Headquarters was divided into five sections, two bureaus and several other specialized units:&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt;
* Section I: Organization – personnel, justice, religion
* Section II: Intelligence and Counterintelligence
* Section III: Operations and Training – coordination, planning, preparation for a nationwide uprising
* Section IV: Logistics
* Section V: Communication – including with the Western Allies; air drops
* [[Bureau of Information and Propaganda]] (sometimes called &quot;Section VI&quot;) – information and propaganda
* Bureau of Finances (sometimes called &quot;Section VII&quot;) – finances
* [[Kedyw]] (acronym for ''Kierownictwo Dywersji'', Polish for &quot;Directorate of Diversion&quot;) – special operations 
* [[Directorate of Underground Resistance]]

The Home Army's commander was subordinate in the military [[chain of command]] to the Polish Commander-in-Chief ([[General Inspector of the Armed Forces]]) of the [[Polish Government in Exile]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; and answered in the civilian chain of command to the [[Government Delegation for Poland]].

The Home Army's first commander, until his arrest by the Germans in 1943, was [[Stefan Rowecki]] (''[[nom de guerre]]'' &quot;''Grot''&quot;, &quot;Spearhead&quot;).

[[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] (Tadeusz Komorowski, ''nom de guerre'' &quot;''Bór''&quot;, &quot;Forest&quot;) commanded from July 1943 until his surrender to the Germans, upon the suppression of the [[Warsaw Uprising]], in October 1944.

[[Leopold Okulicki]], ''nom de guerre'' &quot;''Niedzwiadek''&quot; (&quot;Bear&quot;), led the Home Army in its final days.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt;

===Regions===
The Home Army was divided geographically into regional branches or areas (''obszar'').&lt;ref name=&quot;MNK&quot;/&gt; Below the branches or areas were subregions or subareas (''podokręg'') or independent areas (''okręgi samodzielne''). Smaller organizational units were 89 inspectorates (''inspektorat'') and 280 (as of early 1944) districts (''obwód'').&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt; Overall, the Home Army regional structure largely resembled Poland's interwar administration division, with an ''okręg'' being similar to a [[voivodeships of Poland|voivodeship]] (see [[Administrative division of Second Polish Republic]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt;

There were three to five areas: [[Warsaw]] (''Obszar Warszawski'', with some sources differentiating between left- and right-bank areas – ''Obszar Warszawski prawo- i lewobrzeżny''), Western (''Obszar Zachodni'', in the [[Pomerania]] and [[Poznań]] regions), Southeastern (''Obszar Południowo-Wschodni'', in the [[Lwów]] area); sources vary on whether there was a Northeastern Area (centered in [[Białystok]] – ''Obszar Białystocki'') or whether Białystok was classified as an independent area (''Okręg samodzielny Białystok'').

In 1943 the Home Army began recreating the organization of the prewar Polish Army, its various units now being designated as platoons, battalions, regiments, brigades, divisions, and [[operational group]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-WIEM&quot;/&gt;

==Weapons and equipment==
[[File:MWP Kubus 3.JPG|thumb|''[[Kubuś]]'', armored car used by the resistance, [[Warsaw Uprising]]]]

As a clandestine army operating in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by over a thousand kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stolarski&quot;/&gt; It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field tens of thousands of armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], such as the ''[[Kubuś]]'' [[armored car (military)|armored car]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stolarski&quot;/&gt; Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laqueur&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie234&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stolarski&quot;/&gt;

Home Army arms and equipment came mostly from four sources: arms that had been buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]]; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stolarski&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Panther tank]], operated by ''[[Batalion Zośka]]'' armored platoon commanded by [[Wacław Micuta]]]]
From arms caches hidden in 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Korb&quot;/&gt; However, due to their inadequate preservation, which had had to be improvised in the chaos of the September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.&lt;ref name=&quot;pw25&quot;/&gt;

Sometimes arms were purchased on the [[black market]] from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stolarski&quot;/&gt; Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important.&lt;ref name=&quot;pw25&quot;/&gt; All such purchases were highly risky, as the [[Gestapo]] was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;pw25&quot;/&gt;

Efforts to capture weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were conducted on trains carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and [[gendarmerie]] posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;pw25&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Błyskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|Polish weapons, including (''top'') [[Błyskawica submachine gun|''Błyskawica'' (&quot;Lightning&quot;) submachine gun]], one of very few weapons designed and mass-produced covertly in occupied Europe]]
Arms were clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army in its own secret workshops, and also by Home Army members working in German armaments factories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stolarski&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pw25&quot;/&gt; In this way the Home Army was able to procure [[submachine gun]]s (copies of British [[Sten]]s, indigenous ''[[Błyskawica submachine gun|Błyskawica]]s'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''), pistols (''[[Vis (weapon)|Vis]]''), flamethrowers, explosive devices, road mines, and ''[[Filipinka]]'' and ''[[Sidolówka]]'' [[hand grenade]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stolarski&quot;/&gt; Hundreds of people were involved in the manufacturing effort.  The Home Army did not produce its own ammunition, but relied on supplies stolen by Polish workers from German-run factories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stolarski&quot;/&gt;

The final source of supply was Allied [[air drop]]s. This was the only way to obtain more exotic, highly useful equipment such as [[plastic explosives]] and antitank weapons such as the British [[PIAT]]. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peszke_air&quot;/&gt; Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors ([[Silent Unseen]]), 316 of whom&lt;ref name=&quot;PAFiWWIIpdf&quot;/&gt; were inserted into Poland during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Korb&quot;/&gt;

But the air drops were too little, too late.  Air deliveries from the west were limited by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s refusal to let the planes land on Soviet territory; by the low priority placed by the British on flights to Poland; and by extremely heavy losses sustained by Polish Special Duties Flight personnel.  Especially after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Soviets joined the Western Allies in the war against Germany, Britain and the United States attached more importance to not antagonizing Stalin than they did to the aspirations of the Poles to regain their national sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Alfred Peszke]], ''The Armed Forces of Poland in the West, 1939–46'', 2013, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the end, despite all the efforts, most Home Army forces had inadequate weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000–600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for only some 32,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie234&quot;/&gt; On 1 August 1944, when the [[Warsaw Uprising]] began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw were armed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie234&quot;/&gt;

[[Jürgen Stroop]], in charge of the German effort to liquidate the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], afterward wrote in his report:

{{quote|When we invaded the Ghetto for the first time, the Jews and the Polish bandits succeeded in repelling the participating units, including tanks and armored cars, by a well-prepared concentration of fire. [...] The main Jewish battle group, mixed with Polish bandits, had already retired during the first and second day to the so-called Muranowski Square. There it was reinforced by a considerable number of Polish bandits. Its plan was to hold the Ghetto by every means in order to prevent us from invading it. [...] Time and again Polish bandits found refuge in the Ghetto and remained there undisturbed, since we had no forces at our disposal to comb out this maze. [...] One such battle group succeeded in mounting a truck by ascending from a sewer in the so-called Prosta [Street], and in escaping with it (about 30 to 35 bandits). ... The bandits and Jews – there were Polish bandits among these gangs armed with carbines, small arms, and in one case a light machine gun – mounted the truck and drove away in an unknown direction.|||[[Jürgen Stroop]], ''[[Stroop Report]]'', 1943&lt;ref&gt;-&quot;The Stroop report,&quot; Pantheon 1986 ISBN 0-394-73817-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Stroop Report: The Jewish Quarter of Warsaw is No More'', Secker &amp; Warburg, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Antony Polonsky]], General [[Stefan Grot-Rowecki]], the Home Army's commander, made it clear in an order of 10 November 1942 that the Home Army did not regard the Jews as &quot;part of our nation&quot;, and that action was not to be taken to defend them if it endangered other Home Army objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayevski|first=Florian|title=Fire Without Smoke: Memoirs of a Polish Partisan|year=2003|publisher=Mitchell Vallentine &amp; Company|location=page 3|isbn=978-0-85303-461-2|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joshua D. Zimmerman]] disputes such a description of Rowecki, noting that he was willing to provide the Jews with aid and resources when it contributed to the greater war effort, but that he had concluded that providing large supplies of arms to the Jews would be ineffectual. Zimmerman writes that Rowecki was &quot;clearly sympathetic to the Jews and eager to help&quot;, and that his reasoning was the norm among the Western Allies, whose reaction to news of the Holocaust was that only regular military action against Nazi Germany could halt it. Zimmerman further writes that, while Polonsky was right that at that time Rowecki did not see the Jews as part of the Polish nation, and that his support for them was limited, his (and the Home Army's) attitude would shift substantially in coming months as the brutal reality of the Holocaust became more apparent, and Polish public opinion's support for the Jewish resistance would increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;BaumgartenKenez2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BaumgartenKenez2009-2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Murray Baumgarten|editor2=Peter Kenez|editor3=Bruce Allan Thompson|author=Joshua D.

===Relations with Lithuanians===

[[File:Aleksander Krzyzanowski.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aleksander Krzyżanowski]], Home Army commandant of the [[Wilno]] region]]
Though the [[Resistance in Lithuania during World War II|Lithuanian]] and Polish resistance movements had common enemies&amp;nbsp;– Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union&amp;nbsp;– they began working together only in 1944–45, after the Soviet reoccupation, when both fought the Soviet occupiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{lt icon}} [[Arūnas Bubnys]]. [http://www.genocid.lt/Leidyba/7/arunas7.htm ''Lietuvių ir lenkų pasipriešinimo judėjimai 1942–1945 m.: sąsajos ir skirtumai''] (Lithuanian and Polish resistance movements 1942–1945), 30 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The main obstacle to forming an alliance earlier was a long-standing territorial dispute over [[Vilnius]] (see &quot;[[Żeligowski's Mutiny]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Ethnic Violence: Fear, Hatred, and Resentment in Twentieth-century Eastern Europe&quot;/&gt;

Some Lithuanians, encouraged by vague German promises of Lithuanian [[autonomy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski-163&quot;/&gt; cooperated with Nazi operations against Poles during the German occupation. In autumn 1943 the Home Army opened retaliatory operations against the Nazis' Lithuanian supporters, mainly the Lithuanian ''[[Schutzmannschaft]]'' battalions, the [[Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force]], and the [[Lithuanian Secret Police]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyd&quot;/&gt; and killed hundreds of mostly Lithuanian policemen and other collaborators during the first half of 1944. In response, the Lithuanian police, who had already murdered hundreds of Polish civilians since 1941 (see &quot;[[Ponary massacre]]&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski-L&quot;/&gt; intensified their operations against the Poles.

In April 1944 the Home Army in the [[Vilnius Region]] attempted to open negotiations with [[Povilas Plechavičius]], commander of the [[Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force]], proposing a nonaggression pact and cooperation against Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=HP213/&gt; The Lithuanian side refused and demanded that the Poles either leave the Vilnius region (disputed between Poles and Lithuanians) or subordinate themselves to the Lithuanians' struggle against the Soviets.&lt;ref name=HP213/&gt; In the May 1944 [[Battle of Murowana Oszmianka]], the Home Army dealt a substantial blow to the Lithuanian Nazi auxiliaries of the [[Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski_MO&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boradyn&quot;/&gt;  This resulted in a low-level civil war between anti-Nazi Poles and pro-Nazi Lithuanians, encouraged by the German authorities,&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyd&quot;/&gt; culminating in June 1944 massacres of Polish and Lithuanian civilians, respectively, in the villages of [[Glinciszki massacre|Glitiškės]] (Glinciszki) and [[Dubingiai massacre|Dubingiai]] (Dubinki).&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski-L&quot;/&gt;

Postwar assessments of the Home Army's activities in Lithuania have been controversial. In 1993, the Home Army's activities there were investigated by a special Lithuanian government commission. Only in recent years have Polish and Lithuanian historians been able to approach consensus, though still differing in their interpretations of many events.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW_2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dovile&quot;/&gt;

===Relations with the Soviets===
[[File:19440712 soviet and ak soldiers vilnius.jpg|thumb|Soviet and Home Army soldiers patrolling together in [[Vilnius Offensive|Wilno]], July 1944]]
{{details|Soviet partisans in Poland}}

Home Army relations with the Soviet [[Red Army]] became increasingly poor over the course of the war. Not only had the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet Union invaded Poland]] on 17 September 1939, following the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion]] beginning 1 September 1939, but even after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Germans invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 the latter saw [[Polish partisans]] loyal to the Polish Government in Exile more as a potential obstacle to Soviet plans to take control of postwar Poland, than as a potential ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chod&quot;/&gt; On orders from the Soviet ''[[Stavka]]'' (high command), issued on 22 June 1943,&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski9899&quot;/&gt; Soviet partisans engaged Polish partisans in combat, and it has been claimed that they attacked the Poles more often than they did the Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chod&quot;/&gt;

In late 1943 the actions of Soviet partisans, who had been ordered to destroy Home Army forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski9899&quot;/&gt; even resulted in limited uneasy cooperation between some Home Army units and German forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski&quot;/&gt; While the Home Army still treated the Germans as the enemy and conducted operations against them,&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski&quot;/&gt; when the Germans offered arms and supplies to the Home Army, to be used against the Soviet partisans, some Polish units in the [[Nowogródek]] and [[Wilno]] areas accepted them. However, such arrangements were purely tactical and indicated no ideological collaboration such as was shown by France's [[Vichy regime]] or Norway's [[Quisling regime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski&quot;/&gt; The Poles' main motive was to acquire intelligence on the Germans and to obtain much-needed equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radzilowski&quot;/&gt; There were no known joint Polish-German operations, and the Germans were unsuccessful in recruiting the Poles to fight exclusively against the Soviet partisans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, most such cooperation by local Home Army commanders with the Germans was condemned by Home Army headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski&quot;/&gt; [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] quotes [[Joseph Rothschild]] as saying that &quot;The Polish Home Army was by and large untainted by collaboration&quot;, and as adding that &quot;the honor of the AK as a whole is beyond reproach.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotrowski&quot;/&gt;

With the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] entering Polish territories in 1944, the Home Army established an uneasy truce with the Soviets. Even so, the main [[Red Army]] and [[NKVD]] forces conducted operations against Home Army partisans, including during or directly after Poland's [[Operation Tempest]], which the Poles had envisioned to be a joint Polish-Soviet operation against the retreating Germans which would also establish Polish claims to those territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cienc-lect&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt; The Home Army helped Soviet units with scouting assistance, uprisings, and assistance in liberating some cities (e.g., [[Operation Ostra Brama]] in [[Vilnius]], and the [[Lwów Uprising]]), only to find that immediately afterwards Home Army troops were arrested, imprisoned&amp;nbsp;–even executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;RJC&quot;/&gt; Unknown to the Poles, their Operation Tempest had been fatally flawed from the start due to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s intention of ensuring that an independent Poland would never re-emerge after the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;JOG&quot;/&gt;

[[#Post-war|Long after the war]], Soviet forces continued engaging elements of the Home Army. Many Home Army soldiers continued their war in an anti-Soviet Polish underground known as the &quot;[[cursed soldiers]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rzecz&quot;/&gt;

===Relations with Ukrainians===
{{see also|Poland–Ukraine relations}}
The [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (''UPA''), a Ukrainian nationalist force and the military arm of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (''OUN''), while fighting the Germans, the Soviets, and the Poles&amp;nbsp;– all three of whom they saw as occupiers of Ukraine&amp;nbsp;– decided in 1943 to direct most of their attacks against the Poles. One of UPA's leaders, [[Stepan Bandera]], and his followers concluded that the war would end in the exhaustion of both Germany and the Soviet Union, and that therefore the Poles, who also laid claim to [[East Galicia]] (viewed by the Ukrainians as [[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]], and by the Poles as [[Kresy|Eastern Poland]]), had to be weakened before Poland arose again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt;  Some Ukrainian groups' collaboration with Nazi Germany (though declining in 1943) had discredited Ukrainian partisans as potential Polish allies; Polish plans to restore prewar Poland's borders were opposed by the Ukrainians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt;

The ''OUN'' decided to attack Polish civilians, who constituted about a third of the population of the disputed territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt; The ''OUN'' equated Ukrainian independence with ethnic homogeneity; the Polish presence had to be removed completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt; By February 1943 the ''OUN'' began a deliberate campaign of murdering Polish civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt; ''OUN'' forces targeted Polish villages, prompting the formation of Polish self-defense units (e.g., the [[Przebraże Defence]]) and fights between the Home Army and the ''OUN''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt; The Germans encouraged both sides against each other; [[Erich Koch]] said: &quot;We have to do everything possible so that a Pole, when meeting a Ukrainian, will be ready to kill him, and conversely, a Ukrainian will be ready to kill the Pole.&quot;  A German commissioner from [[Sarny]], when local Poles complained about massacres, answered: &quot;You want [[Władysław Sikorski|Sikorski]], the Ukrainians want Bandera. Fight each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KIRICZUK&quot;/&gt; In [[massacres of Poles in Volhynia|massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia]], beginning in the spring of 1943, between 60,000 and 100,000 Poles were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorz Motyka, Od rzezi wołyńskiej do akcji &quot;Wisła&quot;.

The Polish Government-in-Exile, in London, was taken by surprise; it had not expected Ukrainian anti-Polish action of such magnitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt; There is no evidence that the Polish Government in Exile contemplated a general policy of revenge against the Ukrainians, but local Poles, including commanders of Home Army units, engaged in various retaliations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt; Polish partisans attacked the ''OUN'', assassinated prominent Ukrainian commanders, and carried out operations against Ukrainian villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt; According to [[Grzegorz Motyka]], the Polish actions resulted in 10,000-11,000 to 15,000 Ukrainian deaths in 1943-47, including 8,000-10,000 in the territory of present-day Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorz Motyka, ''Od rzezi wołyńskiej do akcji &quot;Wisła&quot;'', Wydawnictwo Literackie, 2011, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Kondek, [http://nauka.pap.pl/palio/html.run?_Instance=cms_nauka.pap.pl&amp;_PageID=7&amp;dep=272760&amp;_CheckSum=534820480 Ukaże się nowa publikacja o konflikcie polsko-ukraińskim], PAP, 2011-02-20. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By winter 1943 and spring 1944, the Home Army was preparing for [[Operation Tempest]]; one of its goals was to reinforce the Polish position in Volhynia. Most notably, in January 1944 the [[27th Home Army Infantry Division (Poland)|27th Home Army Infantry Division]], numbering 7,000, was formed, tasked with defending Polish civilians and with engaging the ''OUN'' and German forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt;

By mid-1944, the region was occupied by the Soviet Red Army.  Polish partisans disbanded or went underground, as did most of the Ukrainians.  Both would increasingly concentrate on the Soviets as their primary enemy&amp;nbsp;– and both would ultimately fail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder_journal&quot;/&gt;

'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} A number of sources note that the Home Army was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe.
