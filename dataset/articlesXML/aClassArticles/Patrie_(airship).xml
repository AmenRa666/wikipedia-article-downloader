The '''Lebaudy ''Patrie''''' was a [[semi-rigid airship]] built for the [[French army]] in [[Moisson]], France, by sugar producers [[Lebaudy Frères]]. Designed by [[Henri Julliot]], Lebaudy's chief engineer, the ''Patrie'' was completed in November 1906 and handed over to the military the following month. The ''Patrie'' bears the distinction of being the first airship ordered for military service by the French army.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Patrie's'' predecessor, known as &quot;''Le Jaune''&quot; (&quot;The Yellow (One)&quot;) because of its yellow lead chromate protective coating, was donated by Lebaudy Frères to the French army in September 1906 and was therefore the first airship to see military service in France.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, from her base at [[Meudon|Chalais-Meudon]] near [[Paris]], a successful series of military manoeuvres was conducted with the airship by the military command, which included a visit by France's President of the Council [[Georges Clemenceau]]. Following the successful completion of these operations, in November 1907 the ''Patrie'' was transferred under her own power to her operational base at [[Verdun]], near the German border.

Due to a mechanical fault, the ''Patrie'' became stranded away from her base on 29&amp;nbsp;November 1907 in [[Les Souhesmes-Rampont|Souhesmes]]. During a storm on 30 November she was torn loose from her temporary moorings and, despite the efforts of some 200 soldiers who tried to restrain her, she was carried away by the high winds and lost from sight. Had the rope to the emergency gas-release system been attached, her loss could possibly have been avoided.&lt;ref Name=PopMech/&gt;  After crossing the [[English Channel]] and passing unseen through English airspace during the night, the ''Patrie'' was sighted over Wales and Ireland on 1 December. She made a brief landfall near [[Belfast]], before rising again to be blown out over the Atlantic Ocean. Following a sighting from a steamship off the [[Hebrides]], she was never seen again.

Despite the loss of the ''Patrie'', Lebaudy went on to complete a sister-ship to the ''Patrie'', the [[Lebaudy République|''République'']], for the French Army. Additionally, several airships of a similar design to the ''Patrie'' were ordered and delivered to export customers, these included the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

The military uses of airships at the time were considered to be the dropping of bombs (from an altitude at which they were deemed to be out of range of ground-based weapons)&lt;ref name=mastery/&gt; and [[reconnaissance]]. M. Julliot, the designer of the ''Patrie'', stated that &quot;each of the French ships can carry thirty, and on short journeys, even fifty torpedoes of 10&amp;nbsp;kilogrammes (22&amp;nbsp;lb) each.&quot;&lt;ref name=mastery/&gt; For reconnaissance purposes the ''Patrie'' was equipped with &quot;a mounting for a telephotographic apparatus, and for a 100-[[Candela|candlepower]] [[acetylene]] searchlight&quot;.&lt;ref name=flight1909-0119/&gt; A contemporary author related that &quot;from a height of {{convert|4000|ft|m}} the ''Patrie'' observed the smallest movements of formed bodies of troops at the [[Satory]] camp and obtained very clear telephotographs of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Design==

===Overview===
The main structural components of the ''Patrie'', like those of its predecessor, were the envelope (or &quot;gas-bag&quot;), a [[steel|nickel-steel]] frame or keel, and a [[Aerostat|gondola]] suspended from the frame on steel cables. Contained within the envelope was a [[ballonet]], the function of which was to ensure that sufficient gas pressure was maintained in the envelope at all times, irrespective of the degree of expansion or contraction of the lifting gas. Attached to both the gas-bag and the gondola were active and passive control surfaces to provide lateral and vertical stability and to give the pilot directional control over the airship.&lt;ref name=flight1909-0120/&gt;&lt;ref name=flight1909-0121/&gt;

[[File:Nacelle du Patrie 1906 (2).jpg|thumb|left|alt=An airship gondola is shown in close-up from mid-left to mid-right; various items of equipment hang from the gondola's side; below the gondola a pyramid of steel tubing protrudes, shielding a cylindrical fuel tank; four crew members are in the gondola; above it mooring ropes and a rip-line are visible. A flat-ended propeller is also visible on the right|Close-up of the ''Patrie's'' gondola in 1906, showing fuel tank and the propeller]]

The gondola, constructed of nickel-steel tubing, was suspended some {{convert|3.4|m|ft}} below an elliptical steel frame (or keel) attached to the bottom of the gas-bag, under the centre of lift. Between the frame and the envelope and linking the two was a small [[hemp]] net. The net was attached by wooden toggles to a canvas band sewn directly onto the envelope, and the frame was attached to the net by further toggles. This permitted the easy removal of the frame from the envelope. The frame itself could also be dismantled for ease of transport.&lt;ref name=flight1909-0119/&gt;

The open gondola offered the crew and passengers little protection from the elements. It was common for there to have been two pilots, two engineers and two passengers on board during test flights and military missions. Ballast, in the form of 10- and 20-[[Pound (mass)|pound]] (4.5 and 9.1&amp;nbsp;kg) bags of sand, could be jettisoned through a pipe set into the floor of the gondola.&lt;ref name=flight1909-0119/&gt; Other equipment included &quot;a 'siren' [[Loudhailer|speaking trumpet]], [[carrier pigeon]]s, iron pins, ropes for anchoring the airship, a reserve supply of fuel and water, and a [[fire extinguisher]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=mastery/&gt;

===Envelope and ballonet===
The ''Patrie'''s envelope was composed of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and [[Vulcanization|vulcanised]] rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the ''Jaune'', comprised three layers&lt;ref name=Vivian/&gt;). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the [[actinic light|actinic]] components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the [[hydrogen]] lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company [[Continental AG]].&lt;ref name=flight1909-0120/&gt;

The lead chromate gave the envelope the same mustard-yellow colour as its precessor, &quot;Le Jaune&quot;; the remaining surfaces were coloured sky-blue, as is evident in a contemporary artist's impression of the ''Patrie''.&lt;ref&gt;

The ''Patrie'''s design as a semi-rigid airship required that the pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and the air in the ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of {{convert|1|mi|m}}, at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.&lt;ref name=flight1909-0120/&gt;

To control the movement of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the ''Patrie'' was equipped with five [[valve]]s, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. The valves on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded two [[inch of water|inches of water (inAq)]] (500&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]], 0.723&amp;nbsp;[[Pounds per square inch|psi]]); whereas the ballonet valves opened when the air pressure exceeded 0.78&amp;nbsp;inAq (195&amp;nbsp;Pa, 0.282&amp;nbsp;psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the ballonet before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The automatic operation of the valves was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see ''[[#Final flight|Final flight]]'' section below). The pressure in the ballonet was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back-up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained in the event of an engine failure or when the engine had to be switched off for maintenance purposes.&lt;ref name=flight1909-0119&gt;Squier, G.O. (in ''Flight Magazine''), p.121.&lt;/ref&gt;

A release mechanism was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a pull on the attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to ballast, so that it would also be activated automatically in the case of a catastrophic loss of ballast.&lt;ref name=PopMech/&gt; Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the ''Patrie''.

Since a partially filled ballonet would cause longitudinal instability, due to the mass of air rolling fore or aft in the direction of [[Flight dynamics|pitch]], two cloth partitions were used to divide the ballonet into three separate compartments; small holes in the partitions allowed the air to permeate gradually throughout the ballonet without affecting the stability of the airship.&lt;ref name=flight1909-0120&gt;Squier, G.O. (in ''Flight Magazine''), p.122.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steering and propulsion===
[[File:1906 Patrie gondola closeup.jpg|thumb|alt=At the top of the picture the lower portion of an airship's envelope can just be seen; mooring ropes reach up to the top edge of the picture; the gondola and propellers can been seen in the centre, surrounded by soldiers, one with his hands in his pockets looking at the camera|Close-up bow view of the gondola in 1906]]

Directional stability was achieved by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached at the rear of the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear.&lt;ref name=flight1909-0120/&gt; Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced [[rudder]] at the rear of an [[empennage]] on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the [[fletching]] of an [[arrow]], behind which the vertical rudder was mounted.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.

During trials it was decided that a greater degree of control over vertical motion was required, which would also allow the pilot to compensate for &quot;involuntary rising or falling of the airship due to expansion or contraction of the gas, or to other causes&quot;. For this purpose a movable horizontal plane was installed above the car and near the centre of gravity, which resulted in the loss of gas and ballast being reduced to a minimum.&lt;ref name=flight1909-0121&gt;Squier, G.O. (in ''Flight Magazine''), p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a later date this single plane was replaced by two movable planes mounted either side of and above the gondola, attached to the bottom of the elliptical frame, as shown in the [[#Specifications|plan view]] published in the German &quot;Jahrbuch der Luftfahrt&quot; (&quot;Aviation Yearbook&quot;) in 1911.&lt;ref name=Vorreiter&gt;Vorreiter (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; These &quot;ailerons d'ascension et de descente&quot; as they were referred to at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://postcards.delcampe.com/page/item/id,40679770,var,LA-NACELLE-DU-DIRIGEABLE-REPUBLIQUE-AU-DESSUS-LES-AILERONS-ASCENSION-ET-DESCENTE-DESSOUS-HELICES,language,E.htmlLa Nacelle de Dirigeable.] delcampe.com, Retrieved: 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; are clearly visible in the still photograph taken from the short film &quot;Decollage d'un ballon dirigeable&quot; (&quot;The Take-off of a Dirigible Balloon&quot;),&lt;!--/[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x695jd_ballon-dirigeable-alice-guy_shortfilms film of the ''Patrie'']--&gt; made in Moisson by the pioneering French film-maker [[Alice Guy-Blaché]] before her emigration to the United States in March 1907.

Following this flight, ''Patrie'' was deflated until flights resumed in June 1907.&lt;ref name=blondel&gt;{{cite web

During the summer of 1907, 21 further flights were undertaken between 27&amp;nbsp;June and 7&amp;nbsp;August, including one on 22&amp;nbsp;July 1907 in which the President of the Council (Prime Minister) [[Georges Clemenceau]], and the [[Minister of War (France)|Minister of War]] [[Georges Picquart]] were passengers. Although a pipe became detached, showering the Premier with hot water, he reacted nonchalantly, saying &quot;I cannot sufficiently express my admiration for this wonderful contrivance&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYT_19070723&gt;{{cite journal

The ''Patrie'' was then deflated for alterations that included the addition of a 500&amp;nbsp;cubic metre (17,660&amp;nbsp;ft³) cylindrical section to the gas-bag,&lt;ref name=flight1909-0120/&gt; a change to the empennage (as mentioned above) and provision of new propellers.

The ''Patrie'' was reinflated and made ready for operational duty on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1907. Nine flights, totalling 18&amp;nbsp;hours, were undertaken from Chalais-Meudon between 21&amp;nbsp;October and 16&amp;nbsp;November, during one of which the left propeller was lost, causing the ''Patrie'' to ascend rapidly into the low clouds before returning safely but slowly to Chalais-Meudon under her own power. On 23&amp;nbsp;November 1907, the ''Patrie'' was flown to her operational base at [[Belleville-sur-Meuse]] near [[Verdun]], close to the Franco-German border, a journey of 240&amp;nbsp;km (149&amp;nbsp;mi) in 6&amp;nbsp;hours 45&amp;nbsp;minutes, at an average speed of 36&amp;nbsp;km/h (22&amp;nbsp;mph) and a height of {{convert|850|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=flight1917-1285/&gt;&lt;ref name=bellevilles68&gt;{{cite web

While based at Verdun, the ''Patrie'' was stranded on Friday, 29&amp;nbsp;November 1907, at nearby [[Les Souhesmes-Rampont|Souhesmes]] due to a mechanical problem caused by the clothing of one of the mechanics becoming caught in the [[distributor]] drive gear. On-the-spot repairs were made but the lack of a spare [[ignition magneto|magneto]] on board meant that the motor could not be used for the return flight. The decision was made not to drag the airship back to Verdun but to tether her overnight in the open at Souhesmes.&lt;ref name=PopMech/&gt;&lt;ref name=pc_3_propeller&gt;{{cite web

During that night, a storm blew up and approximately 200 soldiers were assigned to the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the ''Patrie'' could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.&lt;ref name=PopMech&gt;{{cite journal

In 2007, the French newspaper ''Journal l'Alsace / Le Pays'' reprinted a news item from 5&amp;nbsp;December 1907, which spoke of the &quot;anxiety&quot; caused in Paris by this &quot;disaster&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}&lt;!--[http://interne.alsapresse.com/jdj/07/12/05/BE/2/article_7.html &quot;Journal l'Alsace / Le Pays&quot; 5 December 2007:]--&gt;Reprint in &quot;Journal l'Alsace / Le Pays&quot; 5&amp;nbsp;December 2007: &quot;Since the balloon's automatic valve only works slowly and only allows a slow rate of escape of gas, it is believed, and this is entirely possible, that the &quot;Patrie&quot; is still aloft at the time of writing. In addition, since the speed of the wind that night was about 60&amp;nbsp;km/h, the dirigible could have travelled a considerable distance. Since the telegram announcing the disaster arrived at the War Ministry, extreme anxiety reigns in Paris. We are now on the lookout for any type of information.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately so far no reports have been able to give a precise indication of the Patrie's route and the direction it took. There is every reason to believe that it will never be recovered or that only its wreckage will be found.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The original French:&lt;br /&gt;&quot;La soupape automatique du ballon ne fonctionnant que lentement et ne permettant qu’un léger échappement du gaz, on croit, et cela est encore fort possible, que le « Patrie » est encore dans les airs à l’heure actuelle. D’autre part, la vitesse du vent ayant été cette nuit d’environ 60&amp;nbsp;km/h, le dirigeable a dû parcourir une distance considérable. Depuis que la dépêche officielle du désastre est parvenue au ministère de la guerre, une extrême anxiété règne à Paris.
On est à l’affût de tous les renseignements.&lt;br /&gt;Malheureusement, aucun avertissement n’a encore pu donner une indication précise sur le passage du « Patrie » et de la direction prise. Il y a tout lieu de craindre qu’on ne le retrouve jamais ou du moins qu’on en retrouve que des débris.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It was feared that the ''Patrie'' could have risen into an eastward air current, crossed the nearby Franco-German border and fallen into &quot;Prussian&quot; hands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Finally news of sightings filtered back to France and spread around Europe and the United States.

===Aftermath===
Despite the loss of the ''Patrie'', the French army did not lose faith in the Lebaudy/Julliot design: A sister-ship to the ''Patrie'', the [[Lebaudy République|''République'']], was already under construction at Lebaudy's Moisson works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
