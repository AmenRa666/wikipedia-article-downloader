'''USS ''Monongahela'' (1862)''' was a [[barkentine]]–rigged screw [[sloop-of-war]] that served in the [[Union Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Her task was to participate in the [[Union blockade]] of the [[Confederate States of America]]. Post-war, she continued serving her country in various roles, such as that of a [[storeship]] and [[schoolship]].

==Built in Philadelphia==
''Monongahela''—the first [[United States Navy]] ship to bear that name—was built by the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] and was launched on July 10, 1862; sponsored by Ms. Emily V. Hoover, daughter of Naval Constructor Hoover who superintended the ship's construction; and commissioned on January 15, 1863, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[James P. McKinstry]] in command.

==Civil War service==

===Assigned to bombardment duty===
Initially assigned to the [[North Atlantic Squadron]], ''Monongahela'' sailed instead to reinforce [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[David G. Farragut]]'s [[West Gulf Blockading Squadron]] off [[Mobile, Alabama]], remaining on duty off that port until ordered to attempt to run past [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] batteries on the [[Mississippi River]] at [[Siege of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]], Louisiana on the night of March 14–15, 1863.

As [[Union Army|Army]] forces ashore conducted a mortar bombardment, the squadron got underway about 22:00, heavier ships {{USS|Hartford|1858|6}}, {{USS|Richmond|1860|6}}, and ''Monongahela'' screening the smaller {{USS|Albatross|1858|6}}, {{USS|Genesee|1862|6}}, and {{USS|Kineo|1861|6}} from the forts, with steam [[frigate]] {{USS|Mississippi|1841|6}} bringing up the rear.

In the course of the ensuing furious engagement, only ''Hartford'' and ''Albatross'' succeeded in passing up river, ''Richmond'' losing her steam power early in the battle and drifting downstream out of range with ''Genesee'' lashed alongside. ''Monongahela'' grounded under the guns of a heavy battery, taking a pounding and losing six men killed and 21 wounded, including the captain, until she worked loose with ''Kineo''{{'}}s aid. While attempting to continue upriver, her overloaded engine broke down, and the sloop was forced to drift downstream with ''Kineo''. ''Mississippi''—grounding at high speed—was hit repeatedly and set afire, eventually blowing up and ending the engagement.

===Attack on Port Hudson===
On 27 May, Confederate defenders turned back a major assault on [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]] following constant bombardment by ''Monongahela'', serving as temporary [[flagship]] of Admiral Farragut, and other ships of the squadron. On July 7, the ship, in company with {{USS|New London|1859|6}}, engaged southern field batteries behind the levee, {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} below [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana]], ''Monongahela''{{'}}s new skipper [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[Abner Read]] being killed in this action. She then departed on October 26 for [[Brazos Island|Brazos Santiago, Texas]], to support [[General (United States)|General]] [[Nathaniel Banks]]’ troops in the capture of that town and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] from November 2–4, in addition capturing several blockade runners.

''Monongahela'' continued her duty off [[Texas]], covering the landing of 1,000 Union troops on [[Mustang Island]], [[Aransas Pass, Texas]] on November 16–17 and supporting a Union [[reconnaissance]] at  [[Pass Cavallo (Texas)|Pass Cavallo]] on the gulf shore of [[Matagorda Peninsula]] from December 31, 1863, to January 1, 1864. She returned to blockade off [[Mobile, Alabama]], soon after, stopping numerous [[blockade runner]]s throughout the spring and summer of 1864.

===Mobile Bay operations===
On July 15, the warship’s boats conducted a reconnaissance of the [[Mobile Bay]] area to determine the Confederate torpedo (naval mines) defenses; and then on August 3, Admiral Farragut took his stripped-for-action squadron of 18 ships, including four [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s, against those defenses. In the fierce fight and great victory that followed, ''Monongahela'' bombarded Confederate forts and then rammed the heavy Confederate ram [[CSS Tennessee|''Tennessee'']]. The sloop succeeded only in damaging herself in the full speed drive into the armored enemy ship, but combined heavy gunfire from the other Union ships forced the Confederate warship to surrender, ending the battle and closing the last major gulf port to the South.

''Monongahela'' remained on duty with the [[West Gulf squadron]] until the end of the Civil War.

==Post-war service==

===Caught in a tsunami===
Post-war, ''Monongahela'' was assigned to the [[West Indies Squadron (United States)|West Indies Squadron]]. While on service with the West Indies Squadron, the warship had the unique experience of being landed high and dry almost a mile inland from the shoreline when a [[tsunami|tidal wave]] struck [[Frederikstad, St. Croix]] on November 18, 1867.

Following an earthquake, she was hit by a wall of water {{convert|25|-|30|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} high and carried over the beach and warehouses to come to rest on an even keel some distance from the water. A working party of mechanics from [[New York Navy Yard]] under Naval Constructor [[Thomas Davidson (naval architect)|Thomas Davidson]] succeeded in refloating the ship on May 11, 1868, following a four-month endeavor. ''Monongahela'' was towed to [[New York City]] and thence [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] where she was slowly repaired, finally departing in 1873 to join the [[South Atlantic Station]].

===Redesignated a training ship===
[[File:USS Monongahela, 1903.jpg|thumb|United States training ship Monongahela, around 1903]]
Following a three-year cruise on that duty, the steam sloop served as a [[Schoolship|training ship]] off the [[U.S. East Coast|east coast]] and then departed for the [[Asiatic Station]], serving in the [[Far East]] until need of repairs took her to [[Mare Island Navy Yard]] in 1879 where she decommissioned. In 1883, the veteran warship was converted to a supply ship, with all her machinery being removed that fall to make additional room for supplies. During the conversion, her rig was changed to [[barque|bark]] to allow her handling by a smaller crew. ''Monongahela'' continued her duty on the [[Pacific Squadron]] as storeship at [[Callao, Peru]] into 1890, and then sailed round [[Cape Horn]] to [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]] to be fitted out as an apprentice training ship.

Emerging from the refit a full-rigged ship, the old converted sloop joined the [[Training Squadron]] in 1891, serving in that capacity until relieving {{USS|Constellation|1854|6}} on May 15, 1894, as [[U.S. Naval Academy]] [[Schoolship|Practice Ship]]. Making annual cruises each year except for 1898, when the [[Spanish–American War|war with Spain]] intervened, the ship conducted her last [[United States Naval Academy|Academy]] cruise from June 6 – September 4, 1899, sailing to [[England]] and [[Portugal]].

Upon completion of this cruise, the ''Monongahela'' became a training ship for apprentices at the Naval Training Station in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  She served for three years in that capacity and cruised to ports throughout [[Europe]]’s Atlantic coast and the [[Caribbean]].

==Destroyed by fire==
Finally detached from the Atlantic Training Squadron on May 9, 1904, the old warship served as a storeship at [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]] until totally destroyed by fire on March 17, 1908.  A 4-inch gun was salvaged from her wreck and put on display at the Naval Station.  Since the gun was deformed by the heat from the fire, it was nicknamed &quot;Old Droopy&quot;.  This gun is now on display on Deer Point.
