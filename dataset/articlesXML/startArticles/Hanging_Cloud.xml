'''Hanging Cloud''' (known in [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] as '''''Aazhawigiizhigokwe''''' meaning &quot;Goes Across the Sky Woman&quot; or as '''''Ashwiyaa''''' meaning &quot;Arms oneself&quot;) was an [[Ojibwe]] woman who was a full warrior (''ogichidaakwe'' in [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]) among her people, and claimed by the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] as the only woman to ever become one. She was the daughter of [[Beautifying Bird|Chief ''Nenaa'angebi'' (Beautifying Bird)]] and his wife ''Niigi'o''. ''Aazhawigiizhigokwe'' was of the ''Makwa-[[doodem]]'' (Bear Clan), and was born and lived most of her life at [[Rice Lake, Wisconsin]].  Her community became part of the [[Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians]] after the 1854 [[Treaty of La Pointe]].

According to Morse, ''Aazhawigiizhigokwe'' wore [[Body painting|war paint]], carried full weapons, and took part in battles, raids and hunting parties. She was a full member of the war council, performed war dances, and participated in all warrior ceremonies.  Shortly after father's death in 1855, her village was ambushed by her [[Mdewakanton]] uncle, [[Chief Shakopee|Chief ''Shák'pí'']].  In this ambush, she defended her village and killed a son of Chief ''Shák'pí'', her cousin.  Armstrong recorded how she was very proud of that period of her life.

''Aazhawigiizhigokwe'' was married three times: all to non-Indians.  Her first marriage was to [[Taylors Falls, Minnesota]] lumberman Joe Koveo.  A daughter was born from this marriage, ''Ogimaabinesiikwe'', known as Julia Quaderer, after she married John Quaderer, Jr.  However, Koveo was already married and abandoned ''Aazhawigiizhigokwe'' shortly after their marriage ceremony.  Her next marriage was to Rice Lake's first mayor, James Bracklin.  Three children were born from this union: Nellie, Thomas, and James, Jr.  Bracklin left Aazhawigiizhigokwe for a white woman, Minnie Russell.  ''Aazhawigiizhigokwe'''s last marriage was to lumberman Samuel Barker, which produced two children, Mary and Edward.  Barker also left ''Aazhawigiizhigokwe'' for a white woman.  In her later years, ''Aazhawigiizhigokwe'' lived in the Whitefish community of the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation with son Thomas Bracklin.

''Aazhawigiizhigokwe'' was the sister of ''Waabikwe'' (the grey haired), who according to Benjamin Armstrong, became the wife of Edward Dingley in 1857, and had a son.  Her husband served in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]] but when assumed dead, she remarried.  After the War, when her first husband returned to Wisconsin and heard of his wife's remarriage, they made arrangements to meet with each other and agreed to let her maintain her second marriage.  She died in 1919.
