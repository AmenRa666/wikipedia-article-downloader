The '''Canoe River train crash''' occurred on November 21, 1950, near [[Valemount, British Columbia|Valemount]] in eastern [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], when a westbound troop train and the eastbound [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR) ''Continental Limited'' collided head-on. The collision killed 21&amp;nbsp;people: 17&amp;nbsp;Canadian soldiers en route to the [[Canada in the Korean War|Korean War]] and the two-man locomotive crew of each train.

The post-crash investigation found that the order given to the troop train differed from the intended message. Crucial words were missing, causing the troop train to proceed on its way rather than halt on a siding, resulting in the collision. A telegraph operator, Alfred John &quot;Jack&quot; Atherton, was charged with [[manslaughter]]; the [[Crown attorney|Crown]] alleged that he was negligent in passing an incomplete message. His family hired his [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|Member of Parliament]], [[John Diefenbaker]], as defence counsel. Diefenbaker joined the [[Law Society of British Columbia|British Columbia bar]] to take the case, and obtained Atherton's acquittal.

After the accident, the CNR installed [[block signal]]s on the stretch of track on which the crash occurred. The railway later realigned the main line in that area, eliminating a sharp curve that prevented crews from seeing oncoming trains. Diefenbaker's successful defence of Atherton became an asset in his political rise. A number of monuments honour the dead.

== Crash ==

[[File:Cedarside.jpg|thumb|left|thumb|Cedarside, looking westbound in the direction of Canoe River, August 2011. The troop train should have stopped at Cedarside siding (righthand track).]]

On November 21, 1950, a westbound troop train, Passenger Extra 3538 West—consisting of the [[CN S-2|S-2-a]] class [[2-8-2]] steam locomotive 3538 and 17&amp;nbsp;cars, about half of which had wood bodies with steel [[underframe]]s—was travelling from [[CFB Shilo|Camp Shilo, Manitoba]] to [[Fort Lewis|Fort Lewis, Washington]]. It was carrying 23&amp;nbsp;officers and 315&amp;nbsp;men of 2nd Regiment, [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery]] (RCHA) for deployment to the Korean War, a movement dubbed Operation ''Sawhorse''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Observer 2010&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Halliday|1997|p=194}} The train was moving through the [[Rocky Mountains]] on the CNR transcontinental mainline.{{sfn|Shaw|1978|p=150}} CNR Train No.&amp;nbsp;2, the eastbound ''Continental Limited'', consisted of the [[CN U-1-a and U-1-b|U-1-a]] class [[4-8-2]] steam locomotive 6004 and eleven all-steel cars and was en route from Vancouver to Montreal.{{sfn|Shaw|1978|p=150}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmonton Journal 1951-01-10&quot; /&gt;

By 1950, the CNR used the part-wooden cars only for the transportation of soldiers; other passengers were no longer carried in them. After the 1947 [[Dugald rail accident]], the [[Board of Transport Commissioners]] had ordered that wooden passenger coaches not be placed between all-steel cars. However, under the terms of that decision, General Order Number 707, the wooden cars with steel underframes did not count as &quot;wooden cars&quot;.{{sfn|Halliday|1997|pp=200–202}}

CNR dispatcher A. E. Tisdale meant to send both trains identical orders to &quot;meet&quot; (get past each other) on a mostly single-track section. His intended order read &quot;Psgr Extra 3538 West meet No.&amp;nbsp;2 Eng&amp;nbsp;6004 at Cedarside and No.&amp;nbsp;4 Eng&amp;nbsp;6057 Gosnell.&quot;{{efn|{{harvnb|Board of Railway Commissioners|1952|p=263}}. The inquiry report discusses the fact that there was no &quot;at&quot; before &quot;Gosnell&quot; in the written order, as all three men agreed the word was transmitted. Parsons and Atherton attributed the fact that the word &quot;at&quot; was not copied down to oversights on their part.}} (Cedarside and Gosnell were [[passing loop|sidings]] where trains could wait to allow opposing traffic to clear.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-12-13, Conflicting reports&quot; /&gt; Tisdale dictated the order from his office in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], to Alfred John &quot;Jack&quot; Atherton, the operator at Red Pass Junction, for delivery to Passenger Extra 3538 West, the troop train, and to F.E. Parsons, the operator at [[Blue River, British Columbia|Blue River]], {{convert|89|mi}} westbound from Red Pass Junction, for delivery to No.&amp;nbsp;2, the ''Continental''. The words &quot;at Cedarside&quot; did not appear in the order as copied down by Atherton to be handed to the troop train crew.{{sfn|Shaw|1978|p=150}} Parsons's version of the order accorded with Tisdale's, and was passed to the ''Continental'' and to Train No.&amp;nbsp;4.{{sfn|Board of Railway Commissioners|1952|p=264}} According to Hugh A. Halliday in his history of Canadian railroad wrecks, &quot;it would have been one man's word against the other, but the Blue River operator had been on the line at the same time. Parsons backed up Tisdale's version of events; Atherton would be cast firmly as the culprit in this affair.&quot;{{sfn|Halliday|1997|p=195}}

When the westbound troop train stopped at Red Pass Junction, Atherton gave the incorrect written order to train conductor John A. Mainprize.{{sfn|Halliday|1997|p=195}} As the full order had been passed to the eastbound ''Continental'', its crew expected to meet the troop train at Cedarside, {{convert|43|mi}} eastbound from Blue River; the crew aboard the troop train expected to meet the ''Continental'' and another train at Gosnell {{convert|25|mi}} westbound from Cedarside.{{sfn|Shaw|1978|p=150}} With neither train crew aware of anything wrong, the troop train passed Cedarside and the ''Continental'' passed Gosnell. Both trains were travelling at moderate speeds, and attempted to negotiate a sharp curve from opposite ends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-12-13, steam&quot; /&gt; Thomas W. Tindall, a forestry employee, saw the two trains approaching each other from an embankment; he tried to signal the ''Continental'' crew, who responded to his frantic signals with a friendly wave.{{sfn|Halliday|1997|p=196}} The two crews did not realise that a collision was imminent until the last moment, and the trains struck head-on at 10:35&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-12-13, steam&quot; /&gt;

The accident occurred south of [[Valemount, British Columbia|Valemount]], {{convert|0.6|mi}} east of a small station named Canoe River,{{sfn|Board of Railway Commissioners|1952|p=263}} {{convert|5|mi}} westbound from Cedarside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-11-22, alt story&quot; /&gt; The crash took place on the only stretch (18-mile (29&amp;nbsp;km) long) of CNR mainline in the mountains not protected by [[automatic block signal]]s.{{sfn|Halliday|1997|p=195}} The leading cars of each train were [[Derailment|derailed]], while those which had been part of the troop train were demolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Veterans Affairs Canada 2003&quot; /&gt; According to testimony at the inquiry, most of the deaths were caused by steam from the troop train's ruptured boiler penetrating the damaged cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-12-13, steam&quot; /&gt; At the moment of the crash, two soldiers, Gunners William Barton and Roger Bowe, both of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], were buying cigarettes at the newsstand aboard the train. The structure of the newsstand shielded them in the crash, and they survived. Their fellow Newfoundlanders, Gunners Joseph Thistle and James A. White, standing just a few feet away, were not shielded by the newsstand and perished.{{sfn|Halliday|1997|pp=196–197}}

== Rescue ==

People from the nearby settlement of Valemount hurried to the scene and found the troop cars damaged beyond recognition. Some had collapsed in the disaster; rescuers used axes and hammers to break into them. There were no medical supplies aboard the troop train,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rocky Mountain Goat 2010-08-31&quot; /&gt; and the only medical officer on board had disembarked in [[Edmonton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Veterans Affairs Canada 2003&quot; /&gt; [[First-aid kit]]s on that train proved empty; a box labelled &quot;Medical Stores&quot; was found to contain only contraceptives.{{sfn|Henderson|2001|pp=18–19}}

Dr. P. S. Kimmett of [[Edson, Alberta]], a passenger on the ''Continental'', took charge of efforts to aid the injured with his wife, a nurse.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP/News-Press 1950-11-22&quot; /&gt; Kimmett supervised efforts to aid 50 people despite having almost no supplies or trained personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evening Citizen 1950-12-12&quot; /&gt; One soldier, still alive, appeared to have not an inch of skin on his body unscalded; another had a chunk of glass piercing his chest from front to back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rocky Mountain Goat 2010-08-31&quot; /&gt; With the exception of the engine and tender of the ''Continental'', which were demolished, there was little damage to the eastbound train.{{sfn|Henderson|2001|p=19}} Several of the passengers on the ''Continental'' suffered minor injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-11-21&quot; /&gt; One dining car on the troop train was used as a hospital, another as a morgue.{{sfn|Henderson|2001|pp=18–19}} James Henderson, a young officer on the troop train, recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I talked with one soldier who lay shivering in a bunk in the hospital coach. He had no visible sign of injury but his face was a ghastly green shade. He wanted more blankets and a cigarette, and I gave him both. An hour later, I helped move his body to the other coach.{{sfn|Henderson|2001|p=20}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the time of the crash, the temperature was about {{convert|0|°F|°C}},&lt;ref name=&quot;AP/News-Press 1950-11-22&quot; /&gt; and there were about {{convert|6|in|cm}} of snow on the ground. The telephone lines next to the track were cut by the accident, but a crewman managed to make an emergency call to [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]] in [[Alberta]]. Because the crash site was {{convert|83|mi}} away, medical relief took three hours to arrive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-11-22, lead story&quot; /&gt; A work engine, in the interim, took the movable coaches of the troop train back along the track as far as Cedarside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-11-22, alt story&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Board of Railway Commissioners|1952|p=266}} The hospital train brought eight nurses and two doctors from Jasper, who spent the trip making what preparations they could. On arrival, they found patients with severe injuries. &quot;There was hardly a case with only one type of [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Douglas 1952-10&quot; /&gt; That rescue train transported the injured to [[Edmonton]] from the crash scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP/News-Press 1950-11-22&quot; /&gt; The Jasper doctors left the train when the rescue train reached there, again placing Dr. Kimmett in charge. He remained so until the civilians were relieved by Army personnel from Edmonton, who joined the train in Edson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Douglas 1952-10&quot; /&gt; Major Francis P. Leask, commanding the soldiers, praised Dr. Kimmett's work, &quot;We couldn't have gotten along without him&quot; and also praised his men, both veterans and recruits, for their calm, efficient work in the disaster.{{sfn|Halliday|1997|pp=194, 198}}

Wintry weather made subsequent attempts to recover the dead difficult; four bodies were never found.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Observer 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-12-13, steam&quot; /&gt; Transcontinental traffic was rerouted temporarily onto [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific]] tracks through [[Calgary]] as the CNR attempted to clear the tracks. The work was hampered by an explosion and fire that broke out on the morning of November 22, consuming many of the wrecked cars and likely the missing bodies, and the wreckage was cleared by that evening, allowing traffic to resume the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evening Citizen 1950-11-23&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Halliday|1997|p=199}}

On November 29, 1950, the remaining soldiers left [[CFB Wainwright|Camp Wainwright]], Alberta, where they had been taken after being evacuated to Edmonton, resuming their journey to Korea. The death toll had been 20, including 16 soldiers. Twelve soldiers and the two two-man locomotive crews died in or shortly after the crash; four soldiers died on the rescue train en route to hospital in Edmonton. A 17th&amp;nbsp;soldier, [[Gunner (rank)|Gunner]] David Owens, died in an Edmonton hospital on December 9, bringing the death toll to 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;Veterans Affairs Canada 2003&quot; /&gt; Owens had suffered severe burns, and was believed on the way to recovery when he suffered a relapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calgary Herald 1950-12-09&quot; /&gt; Gunner Art Evoy, a survivor of the crash, recalled the eeriness of the first [[wikt:roll call|roll call]] at Wainwright, &quot;It was a very small group that answered the roll call that day.&quot;{{sfn|Barris|1999|p=49}}

==Inquiry==
Within days of the crash, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP), as the provincial police for British Columbia, began an investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-11-24&quot; /&gt; The site of the crash was under the jurisdiction of the RCMP detachment in [[Prince George, British Columbia]], and any charges would be laid there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince George Citizen 1950-11-23&quot; /&gt; The CNR suspended all trainmen involved in passing the order to the troop train and held an internal inquiry at Kamloops. The [[Board of Transport Commissioners]] announced that a public inquiry would be held at Edmonton in December 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-11-24&quot; /&gt;

[[File:CNR 6004.jpg|thumb|left|CNR engine 6004 (shown in 1943) drew the ''Continental'' and was destroyed in the wreck.]]

Atherton, aged 22, was dismissed by the CNR before the Edmonton hearings. He testified that there was a lengthy gap in transmission, and that he did not hear the words &quot;at Cedarside&quot;. Although railway regulations called for him to listen to a repeat of the order by the telegrapher at Blue River, he did not do so and instead continued with his other duties, passing the message to the troop train without the vital two words. He denied repeating back the order to dispatcher Tisdale with the two words included.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-12-13, Conflicting reports&quot; /&gt;

Tisdale testified to passing the order by telephone to Blue River and to Red Pass Junction, and that it was correctly read back to him by both operators. He also testified to a brief gap in communications several days before the crash, saying that in the rough country through which the railway line passed it was not uncommon for objects falling against the communication line to cause brief outages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calgary Herald 1950-12-12&quot; /&gt; Parsons also testified that Atherton had correctly repeated back the order.{{sfn|Board of Railway Commissioners|1952|p=264}}

Testimony to the inquiry established the damage to the troop train and those on it. The wooden cars with steel underframes gave little resistance to the impact, unlike the ''Continental'''s steel cars. A CNR official testified that it would cost $127&amp;nbsp;million to replace all such cars with modern steel ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP/Daily Star 1950-11-15&quot; /&gt; Dr. Kimmett testified, stating that though he had six bottles of [[penicillin]] when he began his work, no [[syringe]] could be found to administer it. When a syringe was later found, five of the bottles could no longer be found. No heating was available on the troop train until the arrival of the emergency locomotive from Red Pass Junction, and no [[blood plasma]] had been brought on the hospital train—none was available until the injured reached Jasper. Dr. Kimmett testified that it was &quot;very difficult&quot; to administer plasma on the train, and that two men died between Jasper and Edson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader-Post 1950-12-12&quot; /&gt;

The Board of Transport Commissioners issued its report on January 18, 1951.{{sfn|Board of Railway Commissioners|1952|p=262}} It avoided assigning individual responsibility for the deaths and urged the CNR to install block signals on the section of line where the accident took place. The Board noted that the CNR already had a policy of installing such signals, though they were expensive and difficult to obtain from the United States, and that the CNR had deemed other sections of the line more dangerous. It also urged additional training, to ensure that messages were transmitted accurately, and safety checks to catch instances where messages were transmitted incorrectly.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP/Star-Phoenix 1951-01-20&quot; /&gt;

== Prosecution ==

===Hiring of counsel, arrest===
[[File:John Diefenbaker, MP (1940).jpg|thumb|right|John Diefenbaker, seen soon after his election to the House of Commons, 1940.]]
In anticipation of charges being laid against his son, Atherton's father approached Member of Parliament and [[Queen's Counsel|King's Counsel]] [[John Diefenbaker]] in December 1950 and sought to retain him as defence counsel.{{sfn|Smith|1995|pp=185–186}} The Athertons were Diefenbaker's constituents; their hometown, [[Zealandia, Saskatchewan|Zealandia]], [[Saskatchewan]], was in his [[Lake Centre (electoral district)|riding, Lake Centre]].{{sfn|Smith|1995|p=185}} Diefenbaker declined the case, stating that Parliament had first call on his time, that [[Edna Diefenbaker|his wife Edna]] was seriously ill with [[leukemia]], and that he was not admitted as a lawyer in British Columbia. As Edna Diefenbaker was well known as an influence over her husband, in desperation Alfred Atherton Sr. talked his way into her [[Saskatoon]] hospital room.{{sfn|Smith|1995|pp=185–186}}

In his memoirs, Diefenbaker did not mention the elder Atherton's initial approach but wrote that he was in [[Australia]] at a parliamentary conference at the time of the Canoe River crash. An Australian lawyer pointed out the case to Diefenbaker; he thought it interesting but noted that he was not a member of the [[Law Society of British Columbia]]. Diefenbaker wrote that he planned to meet Edna in [[Hawaii Territory|Hawaii]] on his way back from Australia. Instead she wired him, requesting that he meet her in Vancouver.{{sfn|Diefenbaker|1975|pp=111–112}}

Diefenbaker related that he found his wife in a Saskatoon hospital, in the final stages of the illness that would kill her (she died on February 7, 1951). She told him that Jack Atherton had been to see her and that the soldiers' deaths were from being transported in wooden train cars. &quot;Everyone in the CNR is running away from responsibility for what appears to have been a grievous disregard for human lives.&quot;{{sfn|Diefenbaker|1975|pp=111–112}} John Diefenbaker objected that the [[bar examination]] in British Columbia was notoriously difficult and that the application fee was $1,500. Edna Diefenbaker informed her husband, &quot;I told him you'd take it&quot;, and eventually her husband gave in.{{sfn|Diefenbaker|1975|pp=111–112}}

Atherton was arrested for manslaughter on January 9, 1951, in Saskatoon and was taken to Prince George by the RCMP. After his dismissal by the CNR, Atherton was staying with his parents at Zealandia, where his father was CNR station agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmonton Journal 1951-01-10&quot; /&gt; The manslaughter charge concerned the death of Henry Proskunik, [[fireman (steam engine)|fireman]] aboard the troop train.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evening Citizen 1951-05-14&quot; /&gt; Bail was set at $5,000, and Magistrate P.J. Moran required any sureties to appear before him, making it difficult for Atherton's connections in Saskatchewan to obtain his release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince George Citizen 1951-01-18&quot; /&gt; Atherton was released from custody on January 24, as Prince George furniture store owner Alex Moffat and local CNR employee William Reynolds each posted sureties valued at $2,500.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP/Star-Phoenix 1951-01-24&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince George Citizen 1951-01-25&quot; /&gt;

After his wife's death in February 1951, Diefenbaker travelled to Vancouver in early March to take the British Columbia bar examination,{{sfn|Diefenbaker|1975|pp=112–113}} which the Prince George ''Citizen'' called &quot;a formality which will cost him $1500&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince George Citizen 1951-01-18&quot; /&gt; (Failure to pass the bar would effectively disqualify Diefenbaker from the Atherton case because he would have to wait for reexamination, and the preliminary hearing was set for mid-March.)  He paid his fee and was then given an oral examination by the bar secretary, which in full was:

{{blockquote|&quot;Are there [[statute of frauds|contracts required by statute to be in writing?]]&quot;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Name one of them.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &quot;A land contract.&quot;}} {{sfn|Diefenbaker|1975|pp=112–113}}

Diefenbaker was then congratulated for being the first applicant to pass the British Columbia bar exam with a perfect score.{{sfn|Diefenbaker|1975|pp=112–113}}

=== Hearings and trial ===

The preliminary hearing began on March 13, 1951, and lasted three days, during which [[the Crown]] called 20&amp;nbsp;witnesses. Diefenbaker alleged that the rules of the CNR did not require that the telegraph operator listen to the repeat of his message, but merely recommended that he should. Nevertheless, Diefenbaker's motion to dismiss was unsuccessful and Atherton was committed for trial before the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] (a trial-level court).&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Observer 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Calgary Herald 1951-03-15&quot; /&gt; Manslaughter was a charge for which the accused did not have the option of a speedy trial before a county court judge, and Atherton's case was set for the Spring Assizes in Prince George.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince George Citizen 1951-01-11&quot; /&gt;

The trial began on May 9, 1951. Colonel Eric Pepler, a World War I veteran and British Columbia's deputy attorney general, led for the Crown while Diefenbaker led for the defence. To a CNR official on the stand, Diefenbaker said, &quot;I suppose the reason you put these soldiers in wooden cars with steel cars on either end was so that no matter what they might subsequently find in Korea, they'd always be able to say, 'Well we had worse than that in Canada'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Observer 2010&quot; /&gt; Colonel Pepler objected, stating that Diefenbaker had not asked a question. Diefenbaker responded, &quot;My Lord, it was made clear by the elevation of my voice at the end of the sentence that there was a great big question mark on it.&quot; The judge, Justice A.D. McFarlane, began to rule,{{sfn|Diefenbaker|1975|pp=116–117}} but Pepler interjected, &quot;I want to make it clear that in this case we are not concerned about the death of a few privates going to Korea.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Observer 2010&quot; /&gt; Pepler intended to remind the judge that Atherton was charged in relation to the death of only the troop train fireman, but Diefenbaker pounced: &quot;Oh, you're not concerned about the killing of a few privates? Oh, Colonel!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Observer 2010&quot; /&gt; Diefenbaker recounted that a veteran, sitting on the jury, expressed shock at Pepler's comment, and Diefenbaker lost no opportunity during the rest of the trial to address Pepler as &quot;Colonel&quot;.{{sfn|Diefenbaker|1975|pp=116–117}}

The two lead counsel clashed again during their final addresses to the jury, with Pepler objecting to Diefenbaker's use of testimony from the preliminary hearing. Justice McFarlane stated to Pepler, &quot;I do not think you should object like this&quot;, and when Pepler persisted, the judge &quot;roared&quot; at him, &quot;Please, just stop this.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince George Citizen 1951-05-14&quot; /&gt; Diefenbaker stated, &quot;I sat and suffered while my learned friend misconstrued the evidence&quot; and when he noticed Pepler muttering under his breath, said to him, &quot;You are growling&quot;, to which Pepler replied, &quot;Yes I am growling. I am objecting too.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince George Citizen 1951-05-14&quot; /&gt;

Diefenbaker suggested to the jury that the silence on the line which had, he contended, swallowed the words &quot;at Cedarside&quot; might have been caused by a fish dropped on a snow-covered line by a bird and claimed to have evidence of a previous occurrence. He noted in his memoirs that the incident &quot;was not well documented, but it was all we had&quot;.{{sfn|Diefenbaker|1975|p=115}} He blamed the disaster on Tisdale, stating that lack of the word &quot;at&quot; before &quot;Gosnell&quot; in the order indicated that the Kamloops dispatcher had not been paying attention, and that he should have noticed that, according to Diefenbaker, the words &quot;at Cedarside&quot; were missing from Atherton's repeat of the order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince George Citizen 1951-05-14&quot; /&gt; The trial had taken four days; the lawyers argued for five hours; Diefenbaker's summation took three of them. Justice McFarlane took an hour to charge the jury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evening Citizen 1951-05-14&quot; /&gt; McFarlane told the jurors that if they believed that Atherton had passed the order to conductor Mainprize in the same form he had received it, they would be justified in acquitting him. The jury returned after 40&amp;nbsp;minutes of deliberations. Jury foreman Fred Mounkley announced the acquittal of Atherton, as Atherton's mother wept.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evening Citizen 1951-05-14&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince George Citizen 1951-05-14&quot; /&gt;

== Aftermath ==

The CNR adopted the inquiry recommendations, installing block signalling in the area of the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Observer 2010&quot; /&gt; In 1953, it modernised its passenger fleet, ordering 302&amp;nbsp;new cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calgary Herald 1953-12-26&quot; /&gt; In later years, the line was rerouted to eliminate the sharp curve on which the disaster took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Observer 2010&quot; /&gt;

Atherton went to work for the [[Saskatchewan Transportation Company]] and settled in Saskatoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP/Daily Star 1957-05-18&quot; /&gt; Pepler retired in 1954, having served 20&amp;nbsp;years as British Columbia's deputy attorney general. He subsequently served as one of British Columbia's commissioners on uniform provincial laws&lt;ref name=&quot;Uniformity of Legislation in Canada 1954&quot; /&gt; and embarked on a revision of the rules of the British Columbia Supreme Court before dying on November 16, 1957, at age 66 in a suburban Vancouver hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Advocate 1957-11/12&quot; /&gt;

Diefenbaker had represented Atherton at his own expense, though donations from railroad employees reimbursed him for about half his costs. The case had been followed throughout Canada's railway community, and on his return to Ottawa, Diefenbaker was widely congratulated for his victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evening Citizen 1951-05-16&quot; /&gt; By 1957, he had become [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] and [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] leader, and when he campaigned in Saskatchewan during [[Canadian federal election, 1957|that year's election]], Atherton travelled to [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] to greet him, skipping his own wedding rehearsal.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP/Daily Star 1957-05-18&quot; /&gt; As Diefenbaker campaigned in British Columbia, the Vancouver ''Sun'' reported on the large, enthusiastic crowds he gathered, and noted that he remained well remembered in Prince George for his defence of Atherton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vancouver Sun 1957-05-25&quot; /&gt; Diefenbaker's biographer, Denis Smith, wrote of the Atherton case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Diefenbaker had won a popular victory, redeemed his promise to Edna, and endeared himself for life to Jack Atherton and his fellow railway workers. The case was celebrated in the press and became one of his major political assets.{{sfn|Smith|1995|p=189}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Diefenbaker won the election and, on June 21, 1957, became [[Prime Minister of Canada]].{{sfn|Smith|1995|p=243}}

== Memorials and tributes ==

The RCHA suffered more casualties in the crash than it did in its first year of fighting in Korea.{{sfn|Barris|1999|p=49}} A monument to the soldiers who died stands at [[CFB Shilo]] (as Camp Shilo has been redesignated), where a memorial parade is conducted each year on the anniversary of the crash.&lt;ref name=&quot;D Battery 2rcha&quot; /&gt; It was dedicated on November 21, 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regimental History 2rcha&quot; /&gt;

A memorial [[cairn]] was erected near the crash site by the regiment in 1987. A special remembrance was held in Valemount for the 60th anniversary of the disaster in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Canoe River Memorial&quot; /&gt; The CNR has also raised a monument near the site of the disaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artillery Customs&quot; /&gt; The names of the military dead are inscribed in the Korea [[Book of Remembrance]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Veterans Affairs Canada 2003&quot; /&gt; and are also on the [[Korean War Memorial Wall (Canada)|Wall of Remembrance]] in Brampton, Ontario; they may also be found on the Korea Cairn at Winnipeg Brookside Cemetery. Manitoba has named a lake for Gunner William D. Wright, who died in the crash.&lt;ref name=&quot;KoreaVetsUnit76 - Korea Wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KoreaVetsUnit76&quot; /&gt;

In 2003, as part of Remembrance Week observances for the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]], five family members of the soldiers who died in the crash were presented with [[Memorial Cross]]es. Other family members were due to receive them at a later date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Veterans Affairs Canada 2003&quot; /&gt; The dead were not given posthumous [[Canadian Volunteer Service Medal for Korea|Canadian Volunteer Service Medals]] as they never reached the Korean theatre; Tom Boutillier, a survivor of the crash, considers that an injustice and has campaigned for medals to be awarded.{{sfn|Barris|1999|p=302}}
