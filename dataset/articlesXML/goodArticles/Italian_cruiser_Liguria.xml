'''''Liguria''''' was a [[protected cruiser]] built for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy). She was the fourth of six {{sclass2-|Regioni|cruiser|0}} cruisers, all of which were named for regions of Italy. ''Liguria'' was built by the [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.|Ansaldo]] shipyard in [[Genoa]]; her keel was laid in July 1899, she was launched in June 1893, and was commissioned into the fleet in December 1894. The ship was equipped with a main armament of four {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} and six {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}} guns, and she could steam at a speed of {{convert|18|kn}}.

''Liguria'' served in a variety of roles throughout her career. She frequently was assigned to the main fleet, but in 1904 she was deployed to the American Station. In 1906, she conducted tests with coaling while at sea, and from 1908 to 1911, she was fitted with an experimental observation balloon. She saw extensive action during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1911&amp;ndash;12. She took part in the seizure of [[Benghazi]], provided gunfire support to the defenders of [[Tripoli]], and conducted bombardments of Ottoman ports in western [[Libya]] and the [[Red Sea]] coast of Arabia. She was still in service during [[World War I]] as a training ship, but she did not see action during the conflict. ''Liguria'' was eventually sold for scrap in May 1921.

==Design==
{{main|Regioni-class cruiser}}

''Liguria'' was {{convert|84.8|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|12.03|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.67|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced up to {{convert|3110|MT|sp=us}} at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal [[triple-expansion engine]]s, with steam supplied by four cylindrical [[water-tube boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=G349&gt;Gardiner, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; On her speed trials, she reached a maximum of {{convert|18.1|kn|lk=in}} at {{convert|5536|ihp|lk=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Notes on Ships and Torpedo Boats&quot; 1896, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The ship had a cruising radius of about {{convert|2100|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. She had a crew of between 213&amp;ndash;278.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt;

''Liguria'' was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns mounted singly, with two side by side forward and two side by side aft. Six {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns were placed between them, with three on each [[broadside]]. Light armament included eight {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} guns two {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and a pair of [[machine gun]]s. She was also equipped with two {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. ''Liguria'' was protected by a {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick deck, and her [[conning tower]] had 50&amp;nbsp;mm thick sides.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Liguria towing Sterope.png|thumb|left|''Liguria'' towing ''Sterope'' during coaling underway tests in 1906]]
''Liguria'' was built by the [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.|Ansaldo]] shipyard in [[Genoa]]; her keel was laid on 1 July 1889.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt; Shortages of funding slowed the completion ''Liguria'' and her sister ships. Tight budgets forced the Navy to reduce the pace of construction so that the funds could be used to keep the active fleet in service.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Notes on Ships and Torpedo Boats&quot; 1891, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; It took nearly four years to complete the hull, which was launched on 8 June 1893. [[Fitting-out]] work proceeded much more quickly, and the new cruiser was ready for service a year and a half later. She was commissioned into the fleet on 1 December 1894.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt; That year, ''Liguria'' was assigned to the Third Division of the Italian fleet, along with {{ship|Italian ironclad|San Martino||2}},&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Naval and Military Notes&quot;, p. 565&lt;/ref&gt; an ancient [[central battery ship|center battery]] [[ironclad warship|ironclad]], which had been launched in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902&amp;ndash;03, ''Liguria'' was in the main Italian fleet; while in their normal peacetime training routine, the ships of the main fleet were kept in commission for exercises for seven months of the year. For the remaining five months, they were kept in a partial state of readiness with reduced crews.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Naval Notes&quot; 1902, p. 1075&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was assigned to the American Station in 1904, the sole Italian warship in the region.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Naval Notes&quot; 1904, p. 1430&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1906, the ship took part in experiments with coaling while underway. She towed the [[collier (ship)|collier]] {{SS|Sterope}} at a speed of {{convert|12|kn}} while coal was transferred via the towing cable. An average of {{convert|60|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}} of coal was transferred per hour during the test.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 175&amp;ndash;176&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1908, ''Liguria'' was modified to operate an observation balloon. This service, which lasted until 1911, involved towing a &quot;draken&quot; balloon&amp;mdash;invented by the Germans [[August von Parseval]] and [[Rudolf Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld|Rudolf von Sigsfeld]]&amp;mdash;to spot [[naval mine]]s for the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in September 1911, ''Liguria'' was stationed in [[Italian Eritrea]] with four other cruisers.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; She was transferred to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and on 18 October she joined the escort for a troop convoy headed to [[Benghazi]]. The convoy was heavily protected against a possible Ottoman attack; the escort comprised the four {{sclass-|Regina Elena|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s, two other cruisers, and five destroyers. The Italian fleet bombarded the city the next morning after the Ottoman garrison refused to surrender. During the bombardment, parties from the ships and the infantry from the troopships went ashore.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The Italians quickly forced the Ottomans to withdraw into the city by evening. After a short siege, the Ottoman forces withdrew on 29 October, leaving the city to the Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, pp. 28&amp;ndash;29&lt;/ref&gt;

''Liguria'' thereafter moved to [[Tripoli]], where she supported the Italians who had taken the city against Turkish counterattacks. On 9 November, she, the [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Carlo Alberto||2}}, the [[minelayer]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Partenope||2}}, and the [[torpedo boat]] {{ship|Italian torpedo boat|Cigno||2}} provided critical gunfire support that broke a series of Ottoman attacks on the city.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, ''Liguria'' joined ''Partenope'' and the torpedo boats {{ship|Italian torpedo boat|Dardo||2}} and {{ship|Italian torpedo boat|Euro||2}} for a series of bombardments on the ports of [[Zuwarah]], [[Misrata]], and [[Argub]].&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liguria'' then returned to Tripoli with ''Carlo Alberto'', the [[torpedo cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Iride||2}}, and several torpedo boats while most of the Italian fleet returned to Italy for refitting.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1912, ''Liguria'' and her sister {{ship|Italian cruiser|Elba||2}} were transferred to the [[Red Sea]], along with a pair of fast mail steamers.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The cruiser fleet in the Red Sea then began a campaign of coastal bombardments of Ottoman ports in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; A blockade was proclaimed of the Ottoman ports, which included the cities of [[Al Luḩayyah]] and [[Al Hudaydah]].&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans eventually agreed to surrender in October, ending the war.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

By the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, ''Liguria'' was assigned to the Third Division of the First Squadron as a training ship.&lt;ref&gt;''The New International Encyclopaedia'', p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; Italy declared neutrality at the start of the war, but by July 1915, the [[Triple Entente]] had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The old cruiser nevertheless saw no action during the war. She was sold for scrap on 15 May 1921 and was subsequently [[ship breaking|broken up]].&lt;ref name=G349/&gt;
