'''Andrew Wodrow'''{{efn|name=Wodrow}} (1752–1814) was a prominent Scottish American merchant, [[militia]] officer, [[Court clerk|clerk of court]], lawyer, and landowner in the [[Colony of Virginia|colony]] (and later [[U.S. state]]) of [[Virginia]].

Wodrow was born in Scotland in 1752 and immigrated to Virginia in 1768. In [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], he engaged in a thriving [[import]] business. Following the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], Wodrow placed his entire inventory up for public auction and contributed the profits to the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American Revolutionary patriot]] cause. During the war, Wodrow served as a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in command of [[cavalry]] in the [[Continental Army]].

Wodrow was the first resident clerk of court for [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], Virginia (now [[West Virginia]]), a position in which he served for a tenure lasting 32 years (1782–1814). There, Wodrow served in the position of major in the Hampshire County militia. In addition, he represented Hampshire County at the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]], held to [[Ratification|ratify]] the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788. He was appointed by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] as a trustee of the towns of Romney and Watson Town (present-day [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]]). Wodrow amassed numerous properties which included landholdings along the [[Cacapon River]] and the [[Wilson-Wodrow-Mytinger House]] in [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]], and became a prosperous landholder in Hampshire County.

==Early life and education==
Andrew Wodrow was born in Scotland, possibly in [[Glasgow]], in 1752.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=39.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=423.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pitts|Harding|1976|p=5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Whyte1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Whyte|2009|p=460.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was descended from a family of scholars and professors.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell5&quot;/&gt; His father Robert Wodrow was a historian of the [[Church of Scotland]] with a &quot;national reputation&quot; and published his history in 1752, the same year as Wodrow's birth.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts3&quot;/&gt; Two other members of Wodrow's family filled, in succession, the &quot;chair of theology&quot; at the [[University of Glasgow]] and another Wodrow family member served as the university's librarian.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell5&quot;/&gt; Wodrow immigrated to the [[Colony of Virginia]] in 1768.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Whyte1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Ross1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ross|1896|p=iii.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
During the 1770s, Wodrow established and expanded what became a thriving [[import]] business in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=81.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he abandoned his business rather than import and sell goods from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt; He placed his entire inventory of British goods up for public auction in January 1775 and contributed the resulting profits totaling 19 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] and 14 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] to the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American Revolutionary patriot]] cause in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Eckenrode1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Eckenrode|1916|p=103.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Darter1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Darter|1957|p=188.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wodrow became affiliated with the King George Association of 1770, which called on &quot;every freeholder&quot; in [[King George County, Virginia]] to carry the revolution through to its fullest extent.&lt;ref name = &quot;Harris1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2009|p=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===American Revolutionary War posts===
Following the cessation of his import business, Wodrow was appointed to serve in the political post of [[Clerk (municipal official)|clerk]] for the Revolutionary Committee for King George County on May 6, 1775.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;W&amp;M1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|College of William &amp; Mary|1897|p=105.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the American Revolutionary War in 1779, Wodrow joined the [[Virginia militia]] where he was [[Commission (document)|commissioned]] an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] with the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] and served under the [[Continental Army]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Heitman1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Heitman|1914|p=604.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then served as a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in command of [[cavalry]] until 1781&lt;ref name = &quot;Whyte1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Ross1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Heitman1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Johnston1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnston|1897|p=264.}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he became a member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] of Virginia.&lt;ref name = &quot;Johnston1&quot;/&gt;

Wodrow relocated from King George County to [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]] in [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] during the latter years of the American Revolutionary War.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pitts|Harding|1976|p=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1781, Wodrow was promoted to the military rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in [[Commanding officer|command]] of the Hampshire County militia.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt;

===Hampshire County Clerk of Court tenure===
In 1782, he was elected to serve as the clerk of court for [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] following the retirement of [[Gabriel Jones (Virginia)|Gabriel Jones]], who had been appointed by [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=369.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wodrow was the first clerk of court to reside in Hampshire County while serving in the post.&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts2&quot;/&gt; Because of his key position as clerk, Wodrow performed a significant role in the conveying and settling of lands in Hampshire County.&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts2&quot;/&gt;

On January 10, 1788, Wodrow was recommended to the position of major in the Hampshire County militia.&lt;ref name = &quot;Horton1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Horton|1993|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in March 1788, Wodrow, along with Ralph Humphreys, was elected to represent Hampshire County at the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]] held to [[Ratification|ratify]] the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=47.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pulliam1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pulliam|1901|p=46.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Lewis3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1889|p=216.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Virginia Ratifying Convention convened in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in June 1788, with Wodrow and Humphreys both voting &quot;aye&quot; in favor of ratification.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lewis4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1889|p=215.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pulliam2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pulliam|1901|p=37.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the lead up to the [[War of 1812]], Wodrow chaired an anti-war meeting in Hampshire County at which those assembled objected to a heedless rush to war with the British, which was in line with contemporary [[Federalism in the United States|Federalist]] principles.&lt;ref name = &quot;Butler1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Butler|2012|p=46.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Stuart L. Butler, Wodrow and the meeting's attendees felt that: &lt;blockquote&gt;to involve [the United States] in an expensive and uncertain war, for purposes not absolutely necessary, and entail taxes and misery on ourselves and our posterity, when we might enjoy the blessings of peace and plenty and a good price for our produce on terms as honorable at least as those for the last fifteen years past, would appear to them the extreme of folly, little short of madness.&lt;ref name = &quot;Butler1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Butler2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Butler|2012|pp=46–47.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Wodrow and the committee believed that within two years of the war's beginning, it would become unpopular because of the need for increased taxation and prolonged military service.&lt;ref name = &quot;Butler3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Butler|2012|p=47.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wodrow and the committee stated, &quot;the nation would rise in its constitutional strength, and say to those who brought about such an unpropitious state of things, 'depart from ye wicked.'&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Butler3&quot;/&gt;

Wodrow served as the clerk of court for Hampshire County for a tenure spanning 32 years until his death at his residence in Romney in 1814.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell2&quot;/&gt; Following his death, Wodrow's son-in-law Samuel McGuire served the remainder of his term for fifteen months until 1815 when he was succeeded by [[John Baker White (Virginia)|John Baker White]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Butler4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Butler|2008|p=134.}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Virginia historian Wilmer L. Kerns said of Wodrow in ''Hampshire County, West Virginia, 1754–2004'' (2004) that he &quot;was a prominent and scholarly man, successful in his business, and a good politician.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt;

==Land affairs and holdings==
In 1782, Wodrow served as an [[executor]] of the last [[will and testament]] of his uncle Alexander Wodrow, a wealthy merchant, and sold his personal estate, a [[Moiety title|moiety]] of two land lots in [[Falmouth, Virginia|Falmouth]], and {{convert|212|acre|km2|}} along the [[Rappahannock River]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] to pay his uncle's debts, with the remainder of the proceeds directed to his other family members.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hening1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hening|1823|p=150.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Sydnor1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sydnor|Gearheart|1942|p=12.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wodrow sought permission from the [[Virginia General Assembly]] to sell the remainder of Alexander Wodrow's landholdings in Frederick, Hampshire, and Stafford counties, which he was granted.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hening1&quot;/&gt; In addition to his landholdings, Wodrow was also charged with the sale of his uncle's [[slavery in the United States|slaves]], furniture, watches, buckles, and several personal items.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sydnor1&quot;/&gt; Wodrow personally inherited his uncle's riding horse and &quot;wearing apparel.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Sydnor1&quot;/&gt;

After his move to Romney, Wodrow began to amass numerous properties and became a prosperous landholder in Hampshire County.&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts2&quot;/&gt; In 1788, Wodrow purchased a land tract consisting of {{convert|100|acre|km2|}} along the [[Cacapon River]] in Hampshire County.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=401.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, 1789, Wodrow was appointed by an act of the Virginia General Assembly as a trustee of the town of Romney.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lewis1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1892|p=44.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Lewis5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1889|p=487.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;FWP3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=58.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a trustee alongside Isaac Miller, [[Isaac Parsons (Virginia politician)|Isaac Parsons]], Stephen Colvin, Jonathan Purcell, Nicholas Casey, William McGuire, Perez Drew, and James Murphy.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lewis1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;FWP3&quot;/&gt; Wodrow and his fellow trustees were given authority by the Virginia General Assembly to settle disputes regarding the town's [[land lot]]s and to &quot;open and clear&quot; the town's &quot;streets and lanes&quot; in accordance with the original survey and plan for Romney.&lt;ref name = &quot;FWP3&quot;/&gt; Wodrow was again appointed by an act of the Virginia General Assembly on December 27, 1800 to a second [[Board of directors|board of trustees]] governing Watson Town (present-day [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]]), and charged with laying off [[land lot]]s, streets, and a half-acre lot containing the [[mineral spring]] for public use along [[Capon Springs Run]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Lewis2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1889|p=488.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=410.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, 1808, Wodrow and fellow trustee Henry Beattie conveyed Lot No. 2 in Watson Town to [[Lawrence Augustine Washington]] a nephew of then former President [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Wayland2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wayland|2009|p=273.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of Watson Town is the present-day site of [[Capon Springs Resort]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Wayland2&quot;/&gt;

===Wilson-Wodrow-Mytinger House===
[[File:Wilson-Wodrow-Mytinger House Romney WV 2009 1 25 04.JPG|thumb|right|200px|In the 1780s, Wodrow built his &quot;clerk's office&quot; ''(pictured)'' adjacent to his residence in [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]]. Together with the kitchen building, the three structures constitute the [[Wilson-Wodrow-Mytinger House]].]]
Wodrow and his wife Mary Ann inherited her father Colonel George Wilson's residence on the eastern boundary of Lot 48 in Romney following his death in 1777 and made it their home.&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pitts|Harding|1976|p=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;FWP2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=15.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1770s and 1780s, Wodrow's residence was located on what was then the &quot;main street&quot; in Romney, presently known as Gravel Lane.&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;FWP1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as clerk of court, Wodrow constructed a two-and-one-half story office building adjacent to this residence and its [[kitchen]], all three of which are extant and contribute to the structure presently known as the [[Wilson-Wodrow-Mytinger House]] at 51 West Gravel Lane.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts1&quot;/&gt; The adjoining edifice, built by Wodrow for the handling of his clerk of court affairs, is believed to be the oldest extant public office building within the present-day state of West Virginia.&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt; Wodrow &quot;went to great expense to add beauty and dignity&quot; to his office building, incorporating architectural styles of [[panelling]] and [[woodworking]] prevalent in both Fredericksburg and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts1&quot;/&gt; Following Wodrow's death, his residence was owned by his son-in-law John McDowell.&lt;ref name = &quot;Pitts3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt;

===Old Presbyterian Churchyard===
Wodrow was a dynamic and influential member of the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]], and in his will, he granted two land lots (Lots No. 59 and No. 60) south of West Gravel Lane from his residence for the construction of Romney's first Presbyterian church building and the establishment of a [[cemetery]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;FWP2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;HH1&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.historichampshire.org/resource/pres-cem.htm | title = Old Presbyterian Cemetery in Romney, West Virginia | work = HistoricHampshire.org | publisher = HistoricHampshire.org, Charles C. Hall | accessdate = September 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Woodworth1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodworth|1947|p=382.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wodrow's executor, James Dailey, deeded the two land lots on April 1, 1816 to Mount Bethel Congregation trustees James Beach, William Inskeep, Adam Hare, and John Lawson for these purposes.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;FWP2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;HH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Woodworth1&quot;/&gt; Wodrow was [[burial|interred]] in this cemetery (later known as &quot;the Old Presbyterian Cemetery&quot;) which was located atop the hill of the two lots. The Presbyterian church was built near the corner of West Gravel Lane and South High Streets between 1812 and 1816.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;FWP2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;HH1&quot;/&gt; The Old Presbyterian Cemetery fell into neglect by the late 19th century and was destroyed around 1940 when the hill on which it was located was cut away and leveled for the construction of a factory.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH1&quot;/&gt; Although some human remains and headstones were relocated to [[Indian Mound Cemetery]], Wodrow's remains were likely lost during the destruction of the cemetery.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH1&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==

===Marriage and issue===
Wodrow married Mary Ann Wilson, the daughter of Colonel George Wilson.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Burgess1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Burgess|1973|p=780.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wodrow and his wife Mary Ann had at least five children: Matilda Wodrow McDowell, married to John McDowell; an unnamed daughter, married to Samuel McGuire; Craig Wodrow; Emily Jean Wodrow Kercheval, married to lawyer Samuel Kercheval, Jr., son of Virginia historian [[Samuel Kercheval]]; and Elizabeth Wodrow Dailey, married to James Dailey. Wodrow's son, Craig Wodrow, was a scholar, but due to his chronic poor health, he was unable to pursue active roles in business or politics. Craig Wodrow was also interred in the Old Presbyterian Cemetery in Romney.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;HH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Burgess1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=440.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wayland1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wayland|2006|p=286.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bennett1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|2003|p=188.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wodrow's surname was occasionally spelled in contemporary records and by historians as &quot;Woodrow&quot;, a spelling which was later adopted by some of his descendants. According to historian Peter Ross in his ''The Scot in America'' (1896): &quot;the additional vowel [was] introduced in the name to preserve its sound, a custom which is widely prevalent, and which has helped more than aught else to obliterate many traces of the doings of the early American Scots. This fashion of altering the spelling of names is unfortunately much more common than is generally supposed.&quot;
