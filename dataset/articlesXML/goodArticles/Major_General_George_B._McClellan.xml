'''''Major General George B. McClellan''''' is an [[equestrian statue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] that honors politician and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general [[George B. McClellan]].  The monument is sited on a prominent location in the [[Kalorama Triangle Historic District|Kalorama Triangle]] neighborhood due to efforts made by area residents.  The statue was sculpted by American artist [[Frederick William MacMonnies]], a graduate of the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] whose best known work is a [[Nathan Hale (statue)|statue of Nathan Hale]] in New York City.  MacMonnies was chosen to design the statue following a lengthy competition organized by a statue commission, led by then Secretary of War [[William Howard Taft]].  The monument was dedicated in 1907, with prominent attendees at the ceremony including President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], New York City mayor [[George B. McClellan, Jr.]], politicians, generals and thousands of military personnel.

The sculpture is one of [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|eighteen Civil War monuments]] in Washington, D.C., which were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.  The bronze statue, which rests on a tall granite base adorned with emblems and bronze [[relief]]s, is surrounded by a small public park bounded by California Street, [[Columbia Road]] and [[Connecticut Avenue]] NW.  The monument and park are owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]], a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].

==History==

===Background===
[[George B. McClellan]] (1826&amp;ndash;1885) rose to prominence as a major general during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] who organized the [[Army of the Potomac]].  Although he was unsuccessful in early battles, the [[Union Army|Union]] victory at the [[Battle of Antietam]] temporarily halted the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] invasion of the [[Union (American Civil War)|northern states]].  He was later removed from his post by President [[Abraham Lincoln]], whom he unsuccessfully ran against in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]].  McClellan ran again for public office after the war, serving as the 24th [[Governor of New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=rowland&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gx-IPxyAuo8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780873386036&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a-bDVJCgKIy8ggTxhoSwDQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=George B.

Shortly after McClellan's death in 1885, the Society of the Army of the Potomac, a fraternal organization consisting of Union veterans, began plans to erect a monument honoring the general.&lt;ref name=jacob&gt;{{cite book | title=Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=JHU Press | author=Jacob, Kathryn Allamong | year=1998 | location=Baltimore | pages=130–134 | isbn=9780801858611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It wasn't until March 3, 1901, that Congress appropriated $50,000 for the erection of the statue of McClellan.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;&lt;ref name=smithsonian&gt;{{cite web | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!17855~!0#focus | title=Major General George B. McClellan, (sculpture) | publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month a statue commission, originally led by Secretary of War [[Elihu Root]], Senator [[George P. Wetmore]] and General [[George D. Ruggles]], was formed to oversee the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;star2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1901-04-05/ed-1/seq-1/# | title=A M'clellan Statue | work=Evening Star | date=April 5, 1901 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An advisory committee, composed of sculptors [[Daniel Chester French]] and [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], and architect [[Charles Follen McKim]], was also formed to provide recommendations to the commission.&lt;ref name=rejected&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1903-06-17/ed-1/seq-1/# | title=Were All Rejected | work=Evening Star | date=June 17, 1903 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BYX2HXrSCtcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9781609494216&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0KLDVKXGDYTEgwSW_IDoBQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=McClellan&amp;f=false | title=Kalorama Triangle: The History of a Capital Neighborhood | publisher=The History Press | author=Hansen, Stephen A. | year=2011 | location=Charleston | pages=125–127 | isbn=9781609494216 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A resolution adopted at one of the first commission meetings stated: &quot;That the monument of Gen. McClellan be an equestrian statue, and that this resolution be communicated by the secretary to any commission hereinafter appointed to execute the work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;star2&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Frederick William MacMonnies - Autoportrait.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Frederick William MacMonnies]], 1896 self-portrait]]
In 1902, a design competition was held at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] with a bonus of $500 for each of the four sculptors who submitted the best models of the McClellan statue.&lt;ref name=models&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1902-03-05/ed-1/seq-7/# | title=Models to be Shown | work=Evening Star | date=March 5, 1902 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty-three designs were submitted by May 1, which was later narrowed down to four finalists: Austin Hays, [[Charles Henry Niehaus]], [[Attilio Piccirilli]] and [[Thomas Waldo Story]].&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87062245/1902-06-01/ed-1/seq-34/# | title=Graceful Models for the McClellan Statue | work=The Washington Times | date=June 1, 1902 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The four sculptors were later asked to submit larger models for further review by the advisory committee.  The model submitted by Story was favored by McClellan's widow, Nelly.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;  In 1903, the committee rejected three of the designs, citing a lack of individuality and symbolism.  The fourth design, by Niehaus, was reluctantly approved by the committee, though the commission rejected all of the designs stating &quot;no model submitted upon the competition is satisfactory.&quot;&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;&lt;ref name=rejected/&gt;&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt;

In August 1903, the commission chose [[Frederick William MacMonnies]] (1863&amp;ndash;1937), an American artist and sculptor who lived in Paris, to create the statue.&lt;ref name=selected&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1903-08-12/ed-1/seq-2/# | title=M'Monnies Selected | work=Evening Star | date=August 12, 1903 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacMonnies was a graduate of the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] who had apprenticed with Saint-Gaudens for four years beginning at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name=goode&gt;{{cite book | title=The Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C. | publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press | author=Goode, James M. | year=1974 | location=Washington, D.C. | pages=106 | isbn=0-87474-149-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His previous works included a [[Nathan Hale (statue)|statue of Nathan Hale]] in New York City, ''Columbian Fountain'' at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago and ''Bacchante and Infant Faun'' at the [[Boston Public Library, McKim Building|Boston Public Library]].&lt;ref name=selected/&gt;  MacMonnies' other well-known Civil War work is the sculptural groupings on the [[Soldiers' and Sailors' Arch]] in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;  After his initial design was rejected due to costs overruns, he submitted a new design to the committee, which was later approved by the officials and Nelly McClellan.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt;  The accepted design reflected the influence of MacMonnies' teacher in Paris, [[Alexandre Falguière]], rather than Saint-Gaudens.&lt;ref name=goode/&gt;  James Crocroft was chosen to design the monument while the statue was [[Foundry|founded]] by Edmond Gruet Jeune.&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt;  The Society of the Army of the Potomac paid for the costs associated with improving the monument site.&lt;ref name=nps&gt;{{cite web | url={{NRHP url|id=78000257}} | title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory--Nomination Form - Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=National Park Service | date=September 19, 1977 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 | author=Scott, Gary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site chosen for the monument changed several times throughout the planning process.  Suggested locations included the intersection of [[Florida Avenue]] and [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]] NW, [[Sheridan Circle]] (current site of the ''[[General Philip Sheridan]]'' statue) and the intersection of N Street and [[Connecticut Avenue]] NW (current site of the ''[[Doctor John Witherspoon]]'' statue).&lt;ref name=&quot;star2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt;  In 1906, residents of the [[Kalorama Triangle Historic District|Kalorama Triangle]] neighborhood, then called Washington Heights, represented by cartoonist [[Clifford K. Berryman]] and Rear Admiral [[Thomas Oliver Selfridge, Jr.]], asked the statue commission to consider placing the monument in their neighborhood.&lt;ref name=citizens&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1906-06-01/ed-1/seq-2/# | title=Citizens Suggest Site | work=Evening Star | date=June 1, 1906 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commission, then led by Secretary of War and future President [[William Howard Taft]], Senator Wetmore and General [[Horatio Collins King]], approved the suggested site at the intersection of Connecticut Avenue and [[Columbia Road]] NW, describing it as a &quot;more satisfactory and imposing&quot; location.&lt;ref name=sitechosen&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1906-06-18/ed-1/seq-1/# | title=Site of McClellan Statue | work=Evening Star | date=June 18, 1906 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional factor that led to the site's approval was that the area had been a Union camp during the summer of 1861 when McClellan arrived in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;

===Dedication===
[[File:McClellan statue dedication.jpg|thumb|''[[The Washington Star|Evening Star]]'' photo of the dedication.]]
The dedication of the monument was first planned for October 18, 1906, to coincide with the 37th annual reunion of the Society of the Army of the Potomac.  A fire at MacMonnies' polishing works prevented him from finishing the pedestal in time, so the dedication and reunion were rescheduled for the following May.&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt;  During the delay, MacMonnies exhibited the statue at the 1906 [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris before shipping it to the United States.&lt;ref name=goode/&gt;  The reunion began on May 1, 1907, with opening events held at the Belasco Theater (present site of the [[Howard T. Markey National Courts Building]]), Corcoran Gallery of Art and [[Thomas Jefferson Building]].&lt;ref name=anarmy&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1907-05-01/ed-1/seq-3/# | title=An Army of Veterans | work=Evening Star | date=May 1, 1907 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dedication took place on Thursday, May 2, at 2:30 pm.  Prior to the ceremony, around 700 veterans gathered at the intersection of [[18th Street NW (Washington, D.C.)|18th Street]] and Columbia Road NW, and marched down Columbia Road in a military parade to the dedication site.&lt;ref name=anarmy/&gt;&lt;ref name=around&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1907-05-02/ed-1/seq-3/# | title=McClellan Statue Unveiling Today | work=The Washington Herald | date=May 2, 1907 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Veterans who were unable to march were seated in reviewing stands.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;  The area surrounding the monument included a temporary stand and viewing boxes decorated with [[Bunting (textile)|bunting]], large flags, flowers and shields, while the statue was draped with two American flags.  Prominent attendees at the ceremony included the main speaker, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], New York City mayor and McClellan's son, [[George B. McClellan, Jr.]], William Howard Taft, New Jersey governor [[Edward C. Stokes]], Generals [[George Lewis Gillespie, Jr.]], [[Frederick Dent Grant]] and [[Wallace F. Randolph]], and Nelly McClellan.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald1&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1907-05-02/ed-1/seq-1/# | title=McClellan Statue Unveiling Today | work=The Washington Herald | date=May 2, 1907 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional attendees included members of Congress, foreign diplomats, members of the president's cabinet and thousands of citizens.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016187/1907-05-09/ed-1/seq-1/# | title=Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan | work=The National Tribune | date=May 9, 1907 | accessdate=January 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event was led by Brigadier General Henry C. Dwight, president of the Society of the Army of the Potomac.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald1/&gt;

Following an invocation by Episcopal bishop [[Henry Y. Satterlee]], a brief history of the statue was given by General Horatio Collins King.  McClellan, Jr. then unveiled the statue to cheers and applause from the crowd.  After the unveiling, the Fourth Battery of the Field Artillery saluted as &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot; was played by the [[United States Marine Band|Marine Band]].  After a military parade consisting of thousands of troops led by General [[J. Franklin Bell]] passed the statue and the reviewing stands, the main speech by Roosevelt was given.&lt;ref name=herald1/&gt;&lt;ref name=littlemac&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1907-05-03/ed-1/seq-3/ | title=Bronze Statue of 'Little Mac' | work=Evening Star | date=May 3, 1907 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt's remarks, which covered various topics including war, peace, national pride and family, included the following: &quot;Modern statuary has added a new terror to death. But I wish on behalf of those who live in the capital of the nation to express my very profound acknowledgment to those who had the good taste to choose a great sculptor to do this work. I thank them for having erected here in so well a chosen site a statue which, not only because of the man it commemorates, but because of its intrinsic worth, adds to the nobility and beauty of the capital city of the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=littlemac/&gt;  Following the president's remarks, an overture from ''[[Semiramide]]'', &quot;On the Field of Glory&quot;, was played.  General [[Oliver O. Howard]] then spoke about his interactions with McClellan and General [[Grenville M. Dodge]] read a letter from General [[Daniel Sickles]] (who was ill at the time) that discussed his personal experiences with McClellan&lt;ref name=herald1/&gt;  General Dwight's speech included the statement: &quot;Statues may crumble to dust. Veterans' graves will be obliterated by time, but the grandest monument of the service of valor of the soldiers and sailors of the Civil War, the United States of America, the hope and joy of the world, consecrated to liberty by the blood and treasure of the nation, the undying testimonial of the patriotism of her people, will continue years and years.&quot;&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;  The benediction was given by William R. Jenvey, Episcopal archdeacon of [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], followed by the band closing the ceremony with &quot;[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]].&quot;&lt;ref name=herald1/&gt;

===Later history===
[[File:McClellan monument before and after.jpg|thumb|Before and after the 2009 restoration.]]

The statue is one of eighteen [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C.]] that were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979.  It is also designated a [[contributing property]] to the Kalorama Triangle Historic District, listed on the NRHP on May 4, 1987.&lt;ref name=dcinventory/&gt;  The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS), a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt;

In 2009, the monument underwent a $114,000 restoration by Kreilick Conservation supervised by NPS architectural conservator Catherine Dewey.  It was the first major conservation of the statue since its dedication in 1907.  Scaffolding and nylon mesh were installed around the monument for several months during the restoration, which included cleaning, painting and waxing the statue.  Damage to the monument that was repaired during the process included removing spray paint from the base, removing water leakage inside the horse's legs and stomach, and replicating a bronze shield that was missing from the pedestal.&lt;ref name=partnership&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/preserving-and-restoring-our-nations-monuments/2014/04/14/0a1e0984-c41e-11e3-b574-f8748871856a_story.html | title=Preserving and restoring our nation’s monuments | work=The Washington Post | date=April 15, 2014 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 | author=Partnership for Public Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ruane&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/10/AR2009081002845.html | title=Neglected D.C.

==Design and location==
[[File:Gen. George B. McClellan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Detail of the sculpture]]

The monument is sited on a prominent location at the intersection of California Street, Columbia Road and Connecticut Avenue NW, on the southern edge of the Kalorama Triangle Historic District.  The statue faces south down Connecticut Avenue toward [[Dupont Circle]] and [[Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|downtown]] Washington, D.C.  It is surrounded by a small public park.&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite book | title=Washington West Quadrangle, District of Columbia–Maryland–Virginia (Map) | publisher=United States Department of the Interior | author=United States Geological Survey | year=2011 | location=Reston, Virginia | pages=1 : 24,000. 7.5 Minute Series (Topographic) | OCLC=777027791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adjacent landmarks include the [[Churchill Hotel (Washington, D.C.)|Churchill Hotel]] to the west, [[Lothrop Mansion]] to the north and [[Washington Hilton]] to the east.

The bronze statue is {{convert|13.6|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt;  It depicts McClellan dressed in his Union Army military uniform, including [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]], a hat, sash and sword, while riding a horse.  He is holding the horse's reins with the left hand while the right hand is placed on his hip.
