== Complex sentences you might rewrite ==

Since you asked, I suggest you review these sentences. Suggestion: usually when a &quot;;&quot; is placed in a sentence, that is a sign that the sentence can be broken into two sentences. 

* Through a coup d'Ã©tat he cut from the succession Ostrogotha, Elemund's son; the latter had to escape with his followers to the Gepids' neighbors, the Lombards, with whom a conflict had erupted.

*There is considerable dispute regarding the exact date of this war and the others that soon followed. It has been proposed as possible dates for the first war either 547 or 549; whatever the date the two peoples took the field, while a Byzantine army of 10,000 horse marched against the Gepids under the command of the magister militum of Illyricum John Vitalianus. 

*A lack of trust in the Empire's intention brought Audoin to accept Thurisind request for a truce before a decisive confrontation had taken place; thus when the Byzantines arrived the war had already ended, but not before they had clashed with the Gepids' Herulian allies. 

*Audoin demanded Thurisind to give up as a sign of goodwill the Lombard Ildigis, a pretender to the Lombard crown who lived as a host at his court, but Thurisind refused, even if Ildigis was forced to leave the Gepids and search another people to live with.

*In either 549 or 550 Gepids and Lombards again marched against each other, but according to Procopius the armies were taken by panic and escaped from the battlefield; this ultimately avoided a new war and Thurisind accepted Audoin's request to establish a truce of two years.

*Confronted by an avowedly hostile empire and faced with the eventuality that the war with the Lombards would be renewed at the truce's expiration, Thurisind searched for new allies to use to put Justinian under pressure and found one in the Kutrigurs, that they ferried across the Danube in in 550 or 551  so they could raid the Byzantine Illyricum, before the truce's expiration and probably before the Gepids were ready to precipitate a new conflict.

*Faced with the Kutrigur invasion, Justinian activated his allied peoples against the Kutrigurs, mobilitating the neighboring Utigurs who in their turn asked for help from the allied Crimean Tetraxites; the latter invaded the Kutrigur homeland taking advantage of the absence of many warriors employed at the moment in the Balkans.

*Another move by Thurisind was to protect and promote another enemy of Byzantium, the Sclaveni; the Gepids used their control of the Danube as a mean to ferry Slavic raiders to and from Byzantine territory, obtaining many money in the process.

I stopped before the &quot;Third Lombard-Gepid War.&quot;  There are more. 

Good luck with your review. I am undergoing two right now. As these are the first peer reviews of articles I have written, I am finding I did a lot of things contrary to WP format. It is a real learning experience. [[User:Trfasulo|Thomas R. Fasulo]] ([[User talk:Trfasulo|talk]]) 00:59, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
:Finished, that took me some time. Thanks for the help :-) [[User:Aldux|Aldux]] ([[User talk:Aldux|talk]]) 23:47, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

Dear Aldux and company,

This is a very interesting and well written article---as far as I was allowed to read before bed time. ;) 

What are you working on now?

Best regards, &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Kiefer.Wolfowitz|&lt;font style=&quot;color:blue;background:yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''Kiefer'''&lt;/font&gt;]].[[User talk:Kiefer.Wolfowitz#top|Wolfowitz]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 22:48, 24 January 2012 (UTC)
:Yes a good article but it sometimes assumes too much knowledge in the reader. I found particularly confusing that it gives the impression that relations between the Gepids and Byzantines were hostile all along, and then suddenly says that the Byzantines ended their alliance and stopped paying tribute. This needs more explanation. [[User:Dudley Miles|Dudley Miles]] ([[User talk:Dudley Miles|talk]]) 21:18, 25 January 2012 (UTC)</text>
