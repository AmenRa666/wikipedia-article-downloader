== Looking for citation for religion in infobox ==

Concerning religion in infoboxes (religion in the body of the article has different rules):

From [[WP:BLPCAT]]: &quot;Categories regarding religious beliefs (or lack of such) should not be used '''unless the subject has publicly self-identified''' with the belief or orientation in question, '''and the subject's beliefs are relevant to their public life or notability''', according to reliable published sources&quot; ... &quot;These principles apply equally to lists, navigation templates, '''and Infobox statements'''&quot;.

From [[WP:CAT/R]]: &quot;Categories regarding religious beliefs or lack of such beliefs of a living person '''should not be used unless the subject has publicly self-identified with the belief in question''' (see [[WP:BLPCAT]]), '''either through direct speech or through actions like serving in an official clerical position for the religion.'''&quot;

Per [[WP:LOCALCON]], a local consensus on an article talk page can not override the overwhelming (75% to 25%) consensus at [[Template talk:Infobox/Archive 11#RfC: Religion in infoboxes]] that '''nonreligions cannot be listed in the religion entry of any infobox.'''

Richard Nixon is not a living or recently dead person, so the rules can be relaxed if there are other reliable sources, but I am not seeing them either, and self-identification is the gold standard for inclusion of religion in any article. So does anyone have a citation where Richard Nixon self-identified as a Quaker? Lacking that, does anyone have a citation where anyone else called the adult Richard Nixon a member of the Quaker religion? --[[User:Guy Macon|Guy Macon]] ([[User talk:Guy Macon|talk]]) 22:36, 28 April 2016 (UTC)
:Wouldn't a short google search given you some background? Yes he did, he was raised Quaker and went to Whittier, and could have claimed exemption from World War II service on religious grounds. I'm not at home so can't get you exact citations, but if you consult his memoirs, ''RN'', he speaks extensively of his Quaker upbringing.  And in ''Six Crises'', I believe he mentions going to meeting in Portland, Oregon at the height of the Fund Crisis that culminated in the [[Checkers Speech]].  Whether he wrote of it or someone else did, the point is, he went. Nixon's actual adherence to Quaker observances undoubtedly decreased after his mother died in the 1960s, but that's true of a lot of people in a lot of religions. From what I heard at the Nixon Library the third or fourth trip there, the Sunday morning services at the White House were so nondenominational that his friend [[Murray Chotiner]], a Jew, didn't mind showing up. But there's no question he self-identified as Quaker for at least part of his adult life and never formally left.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 23:28, 28 April 2016 (UTC)
::In his 1960 presidential campaign, Nixon staff prepared a detailed memo explaining the importance of Quakerism to his beliefs: see {{cite book|author=H. Larry Ingle|title=Nixon's First Cover-up: The Religious Life of a Quaker President|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V5aZBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|year=2015|publisher=University of Missouri Press|page=90}} I think that solves the issue of whether religion was important enough to mention here. He also maintained his membership in a local Quaker church. Outsiders, as Rev Martin Luther King Jr, considered him a Quaker. King said that &quot;Nixon happens to be a Quaker and there are very few Quakers who are prejudiced from a racial point of view.&quot; [ibid p 90] [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 00:01, 29 April 2016 (UTC)
:::That's good enough for me. Sources don't get much better than that. Thanks! --[[User:Guy Macon|Guy Macon]] ([[User talk:Guy Macon|talk]]) 16:52, 29 April 2016 (UTC)

== Middle initial in infobox's heading  ==

Look folks, see&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{{find sources|Richard M. Nixon}}&lt;br&gt;{{find sources|Richard Nixon}}.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Established professional journalistic practice, per style manuals of the AP, NYT, ad infinitum, is to render a subject's name in that indivual prefers. Thus it is WP's practice to render this in the header to the infobox when it conflicts with the shortened form the subject is generally known to the public by (as in [[wp:Common name]]); eg see [[Template:Infobox person]]: &quot; If middle initials are specified (or implied) by the lead of the article, and are not specified separately in the birth_name field, include them here.&quot;--[[User:Hodgdon&amp;#39;s secret garden|Hodgdon&amp;#39;s secret garden]] ([[User talk:Hodgdon&amp;#39;s secret garden|talk]]) 15:21, 29 April 2016 (UTC)

== Marine aide is a lieutenant colonel, not a colonel ==

Marine aide is a lieutenant colonel, not a colonel in the RFK stadium picture.  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.28.102.27|108.28.102.27]] ([[User talk:108.28.102.27|talk]]) 17:50, 14 July 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Lead section ==

Hello. In this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Nixon&amp;diff=737356725&amp;oldid=737114761 recent edit], I attempted to copyedit and expand the lead section by adding who he was (i.e. an American lawyer) in addition to serving as the president, using [[Ronald Reagan]] (an FA), as a model. However, it was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Nixon&amp;diff=737373449&amp;oldid=737356725 reverted]. Since I don't want to get involved in an [[WP:EDITWAR|edit war]], and also in accordance with the [[WP:BRD]] process, I am opening a discussion here to get thoughts about the matter: is it necessary to mention the fact that he was also an American lawyer in the lead section in addition to serving as the president? Thanks, [[User:Sjones23|Lord Sjones23]] ([[User talk:Sjones23|talk]] - [[User:Sjones23/Wikipedia contributions|contributions]]) 19:24, 2 September 2016 (UTC)

:The fact that Nixon was American is implicit in his being U.S. president.  His being a lawyer is basically secondary to everything else, since he is entirely known as a politician/public figure.  Thus, [[WP:LEDE]] is satisfied.  The issue is in trying to make everything fit a format of &quot;John Doe was a (nationality) (profession) who ...&quot; That is not necessary and it often comes off strained and stiff. This is a featured article so people have thought about the prose and a deep copyedit of the lede paragraph is probably not necessary.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 22:54, 2 September 2016 (UTC)

::I understand. I was only trying to help. Thanks, [[User:Sjones23|Lord Sjones23]] ([[User talk:Sjones23|talk]] - [[User:Sjones23/Wikipedia contributions|contributions]]) 23:47, 2 September 2016 (UTC)

== Hatnote at top of page ==

{{u|Wehwalt}} I added to {{redirect|Nixon|his presidency|Presidency of Richard Nixon|other people named Nixon|Nixon (surname)|other uses|Nixon (disambiguation)}} because of the discussion at [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2016 September 27]] in the section &quot;President Nixon&quot; and the removal of the [[Template:About]] on [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]] by [[User:Graham11]] on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidency_of_Richard_Nixon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=732400495 14:58, 31 July 2016].  Unfortunately, some editors seem to think that the biographical article is the primary topic of the presidency of RN.  Users need to know that the primary topic of the [[Richard Nixon]] article is biographical and the primary topic of the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]] article is restricted to his presidency.  There is currently confusion surrounding this issue.  [[User:Mitchumch|Mitchumch]] ([[User talk:Mitchumch|talk]]) 12:51, 28 September 2016 (UTC)
:The effect of the hatnote is confusing.  It risks the reader concluding that for ''any'' information about Nixon's presidency, they should go to the presidency article.  The proper place to put such a tag is at the beginning of the account of Nixon's presidency.  I do not say the presidency article is in any way substandard, but we should not divert readers from a FA, sight unseen.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 12:55, 28 September 2016 (UTC)
::{{Reply|Wehwalt}}  What is your assessment of the conversation at [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2016 September 27]] in the section &quot;President Nixon&quot;? &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mitchumch|Mitchumch]] ([[User talk:Mitchumch#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mitchumch|contribs]]) 13:05, 28 September 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
:::My assessment of it is that it is basically the same issue.  It's a question of at what point should readers be diverted to the presidency article. Should we not combine the discussions, since your hatnote is basically auxiliary to the question of the redirect?--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 13:12, 28 September 2016 (UTC)
::::{{Reply|Wehwalt}} I'm confused by your response.
