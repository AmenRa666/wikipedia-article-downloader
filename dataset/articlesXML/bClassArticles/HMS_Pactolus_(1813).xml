'''HMS ''Pactolus''''' was one of eight 38-gun ''Cydnus''-class [[fifth-rate]] [[frigate]]s of the [[Royal Navy]], that served in the [[Napoleonic wars]] and the [[War of 1812]].  She was one of the warships that bombarded [[Stonington, Connecticut]] from 9 to 12 August 1814. ''Pactolus'' was [[Ship_commissioning#Ship_decommissioning|paid off]] in August 1817 and sold in 1818.

==Construction==

''Cydnus''-class frigates such as ''Pactolus'' were actually ''Leda''-class frigates, but built of red fir (pine). Pine was cheaper and more abundant than oak and permitted noticeably faster construction, but at a cost of a reduced lifespan. The motive for the use of red pine – an inferior material for shipbuilding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/cssm1967.pdf |title=The Canadian Sea Scout Manual | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; – was speed of construction.  It was much quicker to build a ship with this material than one of oak; the drawback was that these fir-built ships were less durable than oak-built ships. 

Like all the 38-gun British frigates of the late Napoleonic wars period, she carried twenty-eight 18-pounder guns on the upper deck, fourteen 32-pounder carronades on the quarter deck, and two 9-pounder guns and another two 32-pounder carronades on the forecastle. Under the re-classifications in February 1817, this resulted in her being re-classed from 38 guns to 46 guns.

==Service==
''Pactolus'' was commissioned in September 1813 under Captain [[Frederick Whitworth Aylmer, 6th Baron Aylmer|Frederick William Aylmer]]. He would remain her captain to the end of 1815.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; On 24 March ''Pactolus'' recaptured the Swedish ship ''Maria Christina'' while in company with [[HMS Seahorse (1794)|''Seahorse'']] and another warship.{{refn|The prize money for Aylmer was £187 3[[shilling|s]] 3¾[[pence|d]]; the prize money for an ordinary seaman was £2 2s 4½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17017|startpage=1024|date=30 May 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an ordinary seaman, this would have amounted to about six weeks' wages.|group=Note}}

On 8 August 1814 ''Pactolus'' was part of a small squadron made up of herself, the brig [[HMS Dispatch (1812)|''Dispatch'']] and the [[bomb vessel]] [[HMS Terror (1813)|''Terror'']], all under the command of Captain Sir [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Thomas Hardy]] in [[HMS Ramillies (1785)|''Ramillies'']], &lt;ref name=LG16941/&gt; Together, the vessels attacked [[Stonington, Connecticut]]. Stonington was known for preparing and harbouring &quot;torpedos&quot;, that is [[naval mines]], and for supporting American attempts to destroy British warships off New London.&lt;ref name=LG16941/&gt;

Action commenced on 9 August when ''Dispatch'' anchored within pistol shot of a battery on shore and opened fire, which the battery answered. The water was too shallow for ''Pactolus'' to follow so ''Dispatch'' withdrew, having suffered casualties of two men dead and twelve wounded.&lt;ref name=LG16941/&gt; On 11 August ''Terror'' lobbed shells into the town. ''Ramillies'' and ''Pactolus'' then anchored as close to the town as they could and opened fire, doing a great deal of damage. As they started their bombardment, the Americans withdrew their guns from the battery to the outskirts of town where a large force of militia had gathered. Hardy then withdrew.&lt;ref name=LG16941&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16941|startpage=1963|date=1 October 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pactolus'' was one of some seven ships that shared in the capture of the Spanish brig ''Patriota'' on 6 September.{{#tag:ref|A captain's share of the prize money was £6 2s 4d; an ordinary seaman's share was 1s 1¾d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17702|startpage=1418|date=7uly 1821}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an ordinary seaman this was about one day's pay.|group=Note}} On 6 November ''Pactolus'' was in company with [[HMS Telegraph (1813)|''Telegraph'']] and [[HMS Majestic (1785)|''Majestic'']] when they recaptured the brig ''Recovery''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17496|startpage=1280|date=20 July 1819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 1814 ''Pactolus'' captured the schooner ''Armistice'', of 3 guns, 15 men and 143 tons. A privateer later recaptured ''Armistice'', but then [[HMS Junon (1810)|''Junon'']] re-recaptured the schooner.&lt;ref name=LG17722&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17722|startpage=922|date=16 May 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, ''Pactolus'' captured the schooner ''Post Bay'' of 8 men and 73 tons.&lt;ref name=LG17722/&gt; 

''Pactolus'' returned to Britain and on 9 July 1815 sailed up the [[Gironde]], together with [[HMS Hebrus (1813)|''Hebrus'']] and [[HMS Falmouth (1814)|''Falmouth'']].&lt;ref name=LG17722/&gt; ''Pactolus'' was on a mission to treat with the authorities in Bordeaux over the reestablishment of the monarchy in France. Though the British squadron was under a flag of truce, the fort at Verdon opened fire on them, but without effect. The next day the French evacuated the fort and a British landing party dismantled and destroyed the guns. Over the next few days several more French forts in the area.&lt;ref name=LG17044&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17044|startpage=1513|endpage=1515|date=25 July 1815|accessdate=4  Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British took possession of the forts of Verdon, Royan, de Lotisac, and Miche, which they completely dismantled. They took nearly 70 pieces of heavy artillery (mostly French thirty-six-pounders), including many mortars, all of which they completely spiked and whose carriages they rendered useless. On 22 July Bordeaux declared for the monarchy as French troops, which ''Hebrus'' had brought with her on two transports, took control.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17050|startpage=1644|date=12 August 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1816 Captain William Hugh Dobbie took command of ''Pactolus'' for the [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] station.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; She sailed in May. In July 1816 ''Pactolus'' returned to Portsmouth.

==Fate==
''Pactolus'' was [[Ship_commissioning#Ship_decommissioning|paid off]] in August 1817 as being no longer seaworthy due to dry rot.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentleman's magazine'', Volume 100, p.182.&lt;/ref&gt; The Admiralty sold her to Mr. Maund for ₤2,790 on 29 January 1818.&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), pp.186-7.&lt;/ref&gt;
