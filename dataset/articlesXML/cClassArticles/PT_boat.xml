A '''PT boat''' (short for ''Patrol Torpedo boat'') was a [[torpedo]]-armed [[fast attack craft]] used by the [[United States Navy]] in [[World War II]].  It was small, fast, and inexpensive to build, valued for its maneuverability and speed but hampered at the beginning of the war by ineffective torpedoes, limited armament, and comparatively fragile construction that limited some of the variants to coastal waters.

The PT boat was very different from the first generation of [[torpedo boat]], which had been developed at the end of the 19th century and featured a [[Hull (watercraft)#Categorization|&quot;displacement&quot; hull]].  These first generation torpedo boats rode low in the water, [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] up to 300 tons, and had a top speed of {{convert|25|to|27|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. During World War I the US and UK developed the first high-performance motor torpedo boats (often with top speeds over {{convert|40|knots|mph km/h|abbr=on}}) and corresponding torpedo tactics, but these projects were all quickly disbanded with the Armistice. World War II PT boats continued to exploit some of the advances in [[Planing (sailing)|planing]] hull design borrowed from [[offshore powerboat racing]] and were able to grow in size due to advancements in engine technology.

During World War II, PT boats engaged enemy warships, transports, tankers, barges, and sampans. As [[gunboat]]s they could be effective against enemy small craft, especially armored barges used by the Japanese for inter-island transport. Several saw service with the [[Philippine Navy]], where they were named &quot;Q-boats&quot; most probably after President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]&lt;ref&gt;Q-Boats:Heroes of the Off-Shore Patrol, The Untold Saga of Philippine Army's PT Boats by Commodore Ramon Alcaraz, Philippine Navy (Ret.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary anti-ship armament was four 2,600 pound (1,179&amp;nbsp;kg) [[Bliss-Leavitt Mark 8 torpedo|Mark 8 torpedoes]].  Launched by 21-inch Mark 18 (530&amp;nbsp;mm) torpedo tubes, each bore a 466-pound (211&amp;nbsp;kg) TNT warhead and had a range of 16,000 yards (14,630 m) at 36 knots (66&amp;nbsp;km/h). Two twin [[M2 .50 cal]] (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns were mounted for anti-aircraft defense and general fire support. Some boats shipped a [[20 mm Oerlikon cannon]].

Propulsion was via a trio of Packard 4M-2500 and later 5M-2500 supercharged gasoline-fueled, liquid-cooled marine engines.

Nicknamed &quot;the mosquito fleet&quot; &amp;ndash; and &quot;devil boats&quot; by the Japanese &amp;ndash; the PT boat squadrons were heralded for their daring and earned a durable place in the public imagination that remains strong into the 21st century.

==History==
At the outbreak of war in August 1914, [[W. Albert Hickman]] devised the first procedures and tactics for employing fast maneuverable seaworthy torpedo motorboats against capital ships, and presented his proposal to Rear Admiral [[David W. Taylor]], the Chief of the US Navy's [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Article on Albert Hickman&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.woodenboat.com/library-content/woodenboat100.pdf | title=Damned by Faint Praise: The life and hard times of Albert Hickman | author=David Seidman | magazine=WoodenBoat | date=June 1991 | pages=46–57 | accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1914, Hickman completed plans for a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} Sea Sled torpedo boat and submitted these to the Navy in hopes of obtaining a contract. While favorably received, Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]] rejected the proposal since the US was not at war, but Hickman was advised to submit his plans and proposal to the British [[Admiralty]], which was done the following month. His plan was promptly rejected by the [[Admiralty]], so Hickman built and launched his own privately financed {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=on}} Sea Sled capable of carrying a single 18&quot; [[Whitehead Mark 5 torpedo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Article on Albert Hickman&quot;/&gt; In February 1915, this Hickman sea sled demonstrated {{convert|35|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}} speeds in rough winter seas off Boston to both US and foreign representatives but again, he received no contracts. The [[Admiralty]] representative for this sea sled demonstration was Lieutenant G.C.E. Hampden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Article on Albert Hickman&quot;/&gt; In the summer of 1915, Lieutenants Hampden, Bremner, and Anson approached [[John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company]] about developing a small high speed torpedo boat, and this effort eventually led to the [[Coastal Motor Boat]] which first went into service in April 1916.

Meanwhile, in August 1915, the [[General Board of the United States Navy]] approved the purchase of a single experimental small torpedo boat that could be transportable. This contract for C-250 ended up going to [[Greenport Basin and Construction Company]], of Greenport, NY. When it eventually was delivered and tested in the Summer of 1917, it was not deemed a success, so a second boat (C-378) of the sea sled design was ordered from Hickman in either late 1917 or early 1918 (conflicting dates).&lt;ref name=&quot;Article on Albert Hickman&quot;/&gt; Using his previous design from September 1914 and the previous unsuccessful bid for C-250, the new boat C-378 was completed and fully tested just in time to be cancelled by the [[Armistice]]. With a full loaded weight of 56,000 pounds, C-378 made a top speed of {{convert|37|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}} with 1400 HP, and maintained an average speed of {{convert|34.5|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}} in a winter northeaster storm with 12 to 14 foot seas, which would still be considered exceptional even 100 years later. The Sea Sled would not surface again as a torpedo boat topic until 1939, but would continue to be used by both the Army and Navy as rescue boats and seaplane tenders during the 20s and 30s. In 1922, the US Navy reconsidered using small internal combustion engine powered torpedo boats. As a result, two types (45-ft and 55-ft) of British Royal Navy [[Coastal Motor Boat]]s were obtained for testing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NNoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA497&amp;=true#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Navy Acquires Small Speedy Torpedo Boats&quot;] (October 1922). ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;497–498&lt;/ref&gt;  The larger boat was used for experiments until 1930. In 1938, the U.S. Navy renewed their investigation into the concept by requesting competitive bids for several different types of motor torpedo boats, but excluded Hickman's Sea Sled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Article on Albert Hickman&quot;/&gt; This competition led to eight prototype boats built to compete in two different classes. The first class was for {{convert|54|ft|m|adj=on}} boats, and the second class was for {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} boats. The resulting PT boat designs were the product of a small cadre of respected naval architects and the Navy.

On 11 July 1938, invitations to builders and designers (with the exception of inverted-V boat designers) were issued with prizes awarded for the winning PT boat designs given out on 30 March 1939. In an important note after winning the design competition for the smaller PT boat, George Crouch wrote that Hickman's Sea Sled design would be far superior &quot;in either rough or smooth water to that of the best possible V-bottom or hard chine design&quot;. Earlier when Sea Sleds were specifically excluded, Crouch had informed the Bureau of Ships that the Sea Sled was the best type of vessel for the job. On 8 June 1939, contracts were let to the Fogal Boat Yard, Inc., later known as the Miami Shipbuilding Co., of Miami, Florida, for ''PT-1'' and ''-2'' &quot;Crash Boats&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/14966783/Former-Site-of-Miami-Shipbuilding-Corporation Former Site of Miami Shipbuilding Corporation (Miami)]. Wikimapia.org.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the Fisher Boat Works, Detroit, Michigan, for ''PT-3'' and ''-4''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=motor+gun+boat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ef3pTOzqKpTtngfF-e33DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=motor%20gun%20boat&amp;f=true &quot;Fast Patrol Boat Mounts Heavy Armament&quot;] (September 1940), ''[[Popular Science]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;93. Books.google.com.&lt;/ref&gt; These four boats were designed by George Crouch, and modified in some details by the Bureau of Ships.

Then were the three boats built by [[Andrew Higgins]] of [[Higgins Industries]] in New Orleans. These boats were ''PT-5'' and ''PT-6'' (built using government-required Sparkman and Stephens design, scaled to an overall length of {{convert|81|ft|abbr=on}}) and then ''PT-6 &quot;Prime&quot;'' which was redesigned by Andrew Higgins personally using his own methods. Later that same year, Higgins was to build ''PT-70'' (at their own expense) that incorporated slight improvements over ''PT-6 Prime''.

The [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] simultaneously began construction of two other boats (''PT-7'' and ''PT-8''), created by designers at the Navy Yard and the Navy Bureau of Ships. These boats were constructed mainly out of aluminum and had 4 engines.

Later, rigorous testing performed on each design as well as changes in armament revealed limitations or problems that had to be fixed before they could meet required performance specifications. As a result, the Navy ordered further investigation and refinement of the existing designs until a satisfactory working design could be obtained.

[[File:PT-9 torpedo boat Washington DC 1940.jpg|thumb|267px|''PT-9'' in June 1940]]

At the same time, Henry R. Stuphen of [[Electric Launch Company]] (Elco) and his designers (Irwin Chase, Bill Fleming, and Glenville Tremaine) visited the United Kingdom in February 1939 at the Navy's request to see British motor torpedo boat designs with a view to obtaining one that could be used as a check on the Navy's efforts. While visiting the [[British Power Boat Company]], they purchased a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} design (''PV70'') (later renamed ''PT-9''), designed by [[Hubert Scott-Paine]]. ''PT-9'' was to serve as the prototype for all the early Elco PT boats. After the initial competition, in late 1939, the Navy contracted Elco to build 11 copies of ''PT-9''.&lt;ref&gt;Bulkley p44&lt;/ref&gt;

The final PT boat design competitor was [[Huckins Yacht Corporation]] of [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. 11 October 1940, an agreement between the Navy and Huckins was finalized. The Navy would provide engines, and Huckins would build a PT boat at their own expense, with the caveat that the boat (upon completion) would be offered to the Navy for a later sum. This boat (designated MT-72) was a {{convert|72|ft|m|adj=on}} boat that became ''PT-69''. (Huckins reported a profit of $28.60 on this transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Huckins,''Address Before the Great Lakes Cruising Club'', Chicago (April 21, 1944) contained in ''Huckins, The Living Legacy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plywood Derby===
'''Background'''
In March 1941, during a heavy weather run from Key West to New York by MTBRON&amp;nbsp;2 ([[Motor Torpedo Boat]] Squadron 2), Elco 70-footers pounded heavily in 8 to 10 foot waves even at moderate speeds, and seas continuously broke high over the bows. Operating personnel reported extreme discomfort and fatigue. All boats suffered from some sort of structural failure (forward chine guards ripped away, bottom framing under bows broken, side planking cracked (indicating lack of longitudinal strength), and other weaknesses). In April 1941, MTBRON&amp;nbsp;1 reported enthusiasm over the 81-foot Higgins (''PT-6'') and with the Higgins showing such good seakeeping, that further purchase of Scott-Paine boats was unnecessary. And, in early 1941, [[U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships|BuShips]] lent Packard engines to both Huckins and Higgins, which wanted to build competitive boats at their own expense.

A Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) PT Boat Conference held in May 1941, convened to discussed future PT characteristics. All PTs prior to the {{convert|77|ft|abbr=on}} Elcos had been found defective, and it was probable the extended {{convert|70|ft|abbr=on}} Elco would not be an improvement. This conference, including representatives from BuShips, BuOrd, MTBRONs, Interior Control Board, and CNO, recommended a series of comparative tests to evaluate what turned out to be five new designs of motor torpedo boats. Of note, the conference strongly recommended that no more Elco 77-footers be ordered until the tests had shown that they were indeed satisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;The Chief of Naval Operations,''Report of Conference on Motor Torpedo Boats'', Op-23D-KM, PT/S1(410414)Serial 181923 (Navy Department, June 17, 1941)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Board of Inspection and Survey====
The [[Board of Inspection and Survey]], headed by Rear Admiral [[John W. Wilcox, Jr.]], conducted comparative service tests&lt;ref name=board&gt;Board of Inspection and Survey,''Report of Comparative Services Tests of Motor Torpedo Boats Held July 21–24, 1941 and August 11–12, 1941 at New London, Connecticut'' (Navy Department, August 14, 1941)&lt;/ref&gt; off New London,  21 to 24 July 1941, using the following boats:

* ''PT-6'': {{convert|81|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} Higgins; 3 Packard {{convert|1200|hp|abbr=on}} engines.
* ''PT-8'': {{convert|81|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} Philadelphia Navy Yard; aluminum hull; 2 [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]] {{convert|2000|hp|abbr=on}} engines, 1 [[Hall-Scott]] {{convert|550|hp|abbr=on}} engine.
* ''PT-20'': {{convert|77|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} Elco; 3 Packard {{convert|1200|hp|abbr=on}} engines; equipped with special propellers; special strengthening added to hull framing and deck.
* ''PT-26'', ''-30'', ''-31'', ''-33'': Same as ''PT-20'', except with standard propellers and without special strengthening.
* ''PT-69'': {{convert|72|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} Huckins; 4 Packard {{convert|1200|hp|abbr=on}} engines.
* ''PT-70'': {{convert|76|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} Higgins; 3 Packard {{convert|1200|hp|abbr=on}} engines.
* One {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} MRB-8 (Motor Rescue Boat), built for the Royal Navy by Higgins; 3 Hall-Scott {{convert|900|hp|abbr=on}} engines.

Each member of the Board conducted an independent inspection of every boat class, evaluating them for structural sufficiency, habitability, access, arrangement for attack control, and communication facilities.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

Boats were also evaluated under two conditions of armament loading: loaded and fully equipped with four {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}} torpedoes and sufficient fuel to operate 500 NM at 20 knots; and fully loaded with two {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}} torpedoes and ten {{convert|300|lb|abbr=on}} depth charges with sufficient fuel to operate {{convert|500|nmi|km smi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|20|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

Boats would have their tactical parameters of each design determined by photographs from an airship.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

=====First open-ocean trial=====
Lastly, there was a demonstration of seakeeping qualities and hull strength by making a run at maximum sustained speed in the open ocean. Accelerometers were installed in the [[pilot house]] of each design to record &quot;pounding&quot;. Conducted 24 July 1941, this open-water trial, {{convert|190|nmi|km smi|abbr=on}} at full throttle, would forever after be referred to by PT personnel as the &quot;Plywood Derby.&quot; The course started from the mouth of New London Harbor, to Sarah Ledge, then led around the eastern end of [[Block Island]], then around Fire Island Lightship, finishing at Montauk Point Whistling Buoy.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

At the time, only the Elco 77-footers had the actual ordnance loadout. The rest of the competitors had copper ingots added topside (mostly in the turrets) to make up the difference. This resulted in severe conditions for several of the boats during the trial, and accounted for the transverse failure in ''PT-70''{{'}}s deck and subsequent hull failure as the copper plunged into the hull.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

Nine boats participated in the trial (''PT-26'' had previously developed deck failures while conducting standardization trials off Block Island on July 21, 1941), and six boats completed the trial (''PT-33'' suffered structural damage off Block Island and withdrew, ''PT-70'' suffered its damage from the ingots and withdrew, and MRB developed engine trouble at the start of the run and withdrew).&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

By class, ''PT-20'', the Elco 77-footer, came in first with an average speed of {{convert|39.72|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}; followed by ''PT-31'', with an average speed of {{convert|37.01|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}; ''PT-69'', the Huckins {{convert|72|ft|m|adj=on}} boat, with an average speed of {{convert|33.83|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}} (note the Huckins experienced a high pressure oil failure and had to go DIW (Dead in the Water) in order to effect the repair); ''PT-6'', the Higgins 81-footer, with an average speed of {{convert|31.4|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}; and ''PT-8'', the Philadelphia Navy Yard boat last, at {{convert|30.75|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}. The other two Elco boats, ''PT-30'' and ''PT 23'' (standby boat), followed ''PT-31'', placing before ''PT-69''.

The accelerometers ranked the boats as follows: First was the Philadelphia Navy Yard ''PT-8'' with the least pounding, Second was the Huckins ''PT-69'', Third was the Higgins ''PT-6'', and last were the Elco 77-footers.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

=====Second open-ocean trial=====
Due to the problem with ingot loading, a {{convert|185|nmi|km smi|abbr=on}} trial (with PTs fully fitted out) was conducted on August 12, 1941. Four boats returned: ''PT-8'', ''PT-69'', ''PT-70'', and MRB, and Elco sent two new boats, ''PT-21'' and ''PT-29''. During this trial, boats faced heavier seas, as high as {{convert|16|ft|abbr=on}}. All except the Huckins (''PT-69'') completed the run. The Huckins withdrew due to bilge stringer failure. The Higgins 76-footer (''PT-70'') completed the entire run but also suffered structural failures, attachments between planking and web frames pulling loose, and deck fastenings in the neighborhood of engine hatches showing extensive failures. ''PT-21'' suffered minor cracks in the deck in the same location (but not to the same extent) as previously observed in ''PT-26'', ''PT-30'', and ''PT-33''. ''PT-29'' was assigned as a pace boat with ''PT-8'' in order to generate a pounding comparison.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

The average speed results from the  {{convert|185|nmi|km smi|abbr=on}} course were: Elco 77-footer (''PT-21''), {{convert|27.5|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}; Higgins 76-footer (''PT-70''), {{convert|27.2|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}; Higgins MRB and Philadelphia Navy Yard boat (''PT-8''), {{convert|24.8|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}. Accelerometers were again installed in the pilot house of each boat, but the readings were incomplete because the violent motion of the boats made observations extremely difficult and in some cases necessitated abandonment of the observing stations. Further, many of those taken were beyond the normal range of the instruments and were considered inaccurate. Elco boats were found to pound heavily and confirmed previous reports of their discomfort.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

=====Board of Inspection and Survey's recommendations and opinions=====
The Board arrived at the following recommendations:&lt;ref name=board /&gt;
# That the Packard power plant having been found highly satisfactory be adopted as standard for future construction.
# That the ordnance installation of future motor torpedo boats consist of two torpedo tubes, machine guns and depth charges.
# That the Huckins 78-foot (''PT-69'') design be considered acceptable for immediate construction.
# That the Higgins 80-foot (''PT-6'') design suitably reduced in size to carry such ordnance loads as are required by our Navy be considered acceptable for immediate construction.
# That the Elco 77-foot design be considered acceptable for future construction provided changes in the lines are made to reduce the tendency to pound in a seaway, and the structure be strengthened in a manner acceptable to the Bureau of Ships.
# That the Philadelphia 81-foot boat (''PT-8''') be stripped of excess weight and be re-engined with three Packard engines.

The Board also had the following opinion on structural sufficiency:
&quot;During the first series of tests (July 21–24) the Huckins design (PT-69), the Philadelphia design (PT-8) and the Higgins design (PT-6) completed the open sea endurance run without structural damage. The Higgins 70' (British) boat did not complete this run because of engine trouble. The Higgins 76' (PT-70) and boats of the Elco 77' (PT-20 Class) developed structural failures even under moderate weather conditions prevailing. In the interval between the first and second test periods the PT-70 was repaired and an effort made to eliminate the causes of the structural failures. However, during the second endurance run, which was made in a very rough sea for this size boat, structural failures again occurred in PT-70. PT-69 and PT-21 experienced structural failures during the second run though these were much localized as compared with those found on PT70. The Board is of the opinion that certain changes in design are required to enable PT-69 and boats of the PT-20 Class to carry safely their military loads in rough weather.&quot;&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

=====Analysis of the &quot;Plywood Derby&quot; findings=====
The Board results provided very important benchmarks in the infancy of PT boat development. This type of craft presented design challenges that were still issues decades after, but there are some significant conclusions from the above recommendations and their order of merit. Those are:&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

# The Packard engines were the engines of choice.
# The Huckins 72-foot (''PT-69'') and a reduced Higgins 81-foot (''PT-6'') design were to be placed into production. Following an October 1941 BuShips conference and its new set of navy design requirements which included room to support four {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}} torpedoes and an upper length restriction of 82', the next two orders for pre-war PT boats (''PT-71'' through ''PT-102'') were awarded to Higgins and Huckins.
# Even though the Elco 77-footers posted the fastest speeds, all seven Elcos suffered from structural damage and severe pounding causing the Board to recommend a redesign to correct these deficiencies. Elco competed for the ''PT-71'' to ''PT-102'' contract but did not win due to their higher unit price. After the start of the war and significantly revising their unit cost, Elco received the next PT boat order after Higgins and Huckins. This was to be their new Elco 80-foot design.

===Elco===

The [[Electric Launch Company#history|Elco Naval Division]] boats were the longest of the three types of PT boats built for the Navy used during World War II. By war's end, more of the Elco {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} boats were built (326 in all) than any other type of motor torpedo boat. The 80-foot wooden-[[hull (ship)|hulled]] craft were classified as boats in comparison with much larger steel-hulled destroyers, but were comparable in size to many wooden sailing ships in history. They had a {{convert|20|ft|8|in|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Beam (nautical)|beam]]. Though often said to be made of [[plywood]], they were actually made of two diagonal layered {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on|abbr=on}} thick [[mahogany]] planks, with a glue-impregnated layer of canvas in between. Holding all this together were thousands of bronze screws and copper rivets. This type of construction made it possible for damage to the wooden hulls of these boats to be easily repaired at the front lines by base force personnel. Five Elco Boats were manufactured in [[knock-down kit]] form and sent to Long Beach Boatworks for assembly on the West Coast as part of an experiment and as a proof of concept.

===Higgins===
[[Higgins Industries]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] produced 199 {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} boats of the ''[[PT-71]]''/''PT-235'', ''PT-265'' and ''PT-625'' classes. The Higgins boats had the same beam, full load displacement, engines, generators, shaft horsepower, trial speed, armament, and crew accommodation as the {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} Elco boats. Many Higgins boats were sent to the [[Soviet Union]] and Great Britain at the beginning of the war, so many of the lower-numbered squadrons in the U.S. Navy were made up exclusively of Elcos. U.S. Navy PT boats were organized into Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons (MTBRONs or simply RONs). The first Higgins boats for the U.S. Navy were used in the Battle for the [[Aleutian Islands]] (Attu and Kiska) as part of Squadrons 13 and 16, and others (RON15 and RON22) in the Mediterranean against the Germans. They were also used during the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944.

Even though only half as many Higgins boats were produced, far more survive (seven hulls, three of which have been restored to their World War II configuration) than the more numerous Elco boats. Of the Elco boats, only three hulls (one restored) are known to exist as of 2016.

===Huckins Yacht Corporation===

[[Frank P. Huckins]] and his innovative Quadraconic hull design were latecomers to PT boat design. Not invited to participate in the original design competition, by late 1940, Huckins had a meeting with Captain James M. Irish, Chief of Design of BuShips, and offered to build a &quot;planing seagoing hull&quot; PT boat, on the condition the Navy loan Huckins engines and agree to look at the Huckins boat. In early July 1941, the Navy accepted ''PT-69''. After obtaining excellent testing results at the Plywood Derby, the Navy awarded Huckins Yacht Corporation a contract in 1941 for 8 boats, and later added 10 more. The design was enlarged and modified to meet the new requirements. The first three of the new design (''PT-95'' through ''PT-97'') were initially kept in the Jacksonville area for testing, resulting in several important modifications to the overall design (these boats were later assigned to Squadron 4 in 1942). Huckins ended up building just two squadrons of PT boats during World War II.  Five 78-foot (24 m) boats were assigned to Squadron 14 (''PT-98'' through ''PT-102'') which was commissioned in early 1943; and ten boats assigned to Squadron 26 (PT-255 thru PT-264) which was commissioned in mid 1943.  They were assigned to specific outposts in the [[Panama Canal Zone]], [[Miami, Florida]], the [[Hawaiian Sea Frontier]] at [[Pearl Harbor]] and Midway, and a training center in [[Melville, Rhode Island]].

Although not used in any other PT boat design, Huckins licensed the use of his patented Quadraconic hull in his PT boat construction. He also granted permission for Elco, Higgins, and the Philadelphia Navy Yard to use his patented laminated keel, which increased hull strength, although neither Elco nor Higgins ever chose to use it on their boats. Most probably due to the lateness in joining the PT boat program and unlike Elco and Higgins, the Huckins yard was never provided any government support to construct a larger facility prior to the war. The handcrafted Huckins PT was produced at their civilian facility at a speed of one per month. The success and ruggedness of the Huckins' 78-foot seagoing design is demonstrated by Squadron 26's constant ready-boat operations and Fleet torpedo boat training in the oceans around Midway and Hawaii during the last two years of the war.

===Vosper and other types of PT boats===
During World War II, [[Vosper &amp; Company|Vospers]] of Great Britain arranged for several boatyards in the United States. to build British-designed {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s under license to help the war effort. The boatyards were located in Annapolis, City Island, Miami, and Los Angeles. 146 boats, armed with {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on|abbr=on}} torpedoes, were built for [[Lend Lease]], and exported to Allied powers such as Canada, Britain, Norway, and the [[Soviet Union]]. These boats were never used by the U.S. Navy, and only about 50 were used by the [[Royal Navy]]; most were passed to other countries.

In addition, the [[Canadian Power Boat Company]] produced four Scott-Paine designed PTs for the U.S. These were to be provided to the Dutch forces under Lend Lease, but were re-requistioned to the USN as PT 368-371.

==Construction==
With accommodation for three [[officer (armed forces)|officer]]s and 14 enlisted men, the crew varied from 12 to 17, depending upon the number and type of weapons installed. Full-load displacement late in the war was 56 tons.

The hull shape of the Elco and Higgins PT boats were similar to the warped &quot;planing hull&quot; found in pleasure boats of the time (and still in use today): a sharp V at the bow softening to a flat bottom at the stern. A common characteristic of this type of warped hull is the &quot;rooster tail&quot; in the wake. Unlike the actual &quot;planing hull&quot; Huckins, which planed at 10-11 knots, the Elco and Higgins PT boats were intended to plane at higher speeds (PT 71 and PT-103 classes at around 27 knots, and the PT-265 and 625 classes at around 23 knots). The Elco, Higgins and Huckins companies used varying lightweight techniques of hull construction which included two layers of double diagonal mahogany planking utilizing a glue-impregnated cloth layer between inner and outer planks. These planks were held together by thousands of copper rivets and bronze screws. The overall result was an extremely light and strong hull which could be easily repaired at the front lines when battle damage was sustained.

[[File:NH 64787-KN crop.tiff|thumb|287px|Painting by [[Gerard Richardson]]: USS PT-167 is struck by an enemy torpedo, on 5 November 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NH 64787-KN|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/our-collections/photography/numerical-list-of-images/nhhc-series/nh-series/NH-64000/NH-64787-KN.html|website=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]]|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As a testament to the strength of this type of construction, several PT boats withstood catastrophic battle damage and still remained afloat. For example, the forward half of future President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ''PT-109'' (Elco) stayed afloat for 12 hours after she was cut in half by the Japanese destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Amagiri (1930)|''Amagiri'']]. ''PT-323'' (Elco) was cut in half by a ''[[kamikaze]]'' aircraft on 10 December 1944 off [[Leyte]], yet remained floating for several hours. ''PT-308'' (Higgins) had her stern sheared off by a collision with ''PT-304'' during a night mission in the Mediterranean on 9 March 1945 and yet returned to base for repairs. ''PT-167'' (Elco) was holed through the bow off [[New Georgia|Bougainville]] on 5 November 1943, by a torpedo which failed to detonate; the boat remained in action and was repaired the next day.

In 1943, an inquiry was held by the Navy to discuss planing, hull design, and fuel consumption issues, that resulted in the November 1943 Miami test trial between two Higgins and two Elco boats, but no major additional modifications were made before the end of the war. (Wooden Boat Forum) During the war, Elco came up with stepped hull designs which achieved significant increase in top speed, (&quot;ElcoPlane&quot;), also Higgins developed the small and fast 70' ''Higgins Hellcat'' which was a slight variation on their original hull form, but the Navy rejected them for full production due to their increased fuel consumption and other considerations.

After the war, Lindsay Lord, who was stationed in Hawaii during the war, recorded the Navy's planing hull research and findings in the book ''Naval Architecture of Planing Hulls''. This covers PT boat hull design and construction, and provides hull test data as well as detailed analysis of the various PT boat designs.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Lord, ''Naval Architecture of Planing Hulls'' (Cornell Maritime Press, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armament==
The primary anti-ship armament was two to four [[Mark 8 torpedo|Mark 8]] [[torpedo]]es, which weighed {{convert|2600|lb|kg|0}} and contained a {{convert|466|lb|adj=on}} TNT warhead. These torpedoes were launched by Mark 18 {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on}} steel [[torpedo tube]]s. Mark 8 torpedoes had a range of {{convert|16000|yd|m|0}} at {{convert|36|knots|mph}}. These torpedoes and tubes were replaced in mid-1943 by four lightweight {{convert|22.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[Mark 13 torpedo]]es, which weighed {{convert|2216|lb}} and contained a {{convert|600|lb|adj=on}} Torpex-filled warhead. These torpedoes were carried on lightweight Mark 1 roll-off style torpedo launching racks. The Mk13 torpedo had a range of {{convert|6300|yd|m}} and a speed of {{convert|33.5|knots|mph}}.

PT boats were also well armed with numerous automatic weapons. Common to all US PT boats were the two twin [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 .50 cal]] (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns. Early PT boats (Elco PT20 through PT44) mounted Dewandre plexiglas-enclosed hydraulically operated rotating turrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DESCRIPTION AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DEWANDRE-ELCO POWER-OPERATED MACHINE GUN TURRET|url=http://www.maritime.org/doc/pt/turret/index.htm|publisher=maritime.org|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the Dewandre turrets were replaced on the entire PT boat fleet with open ring twin mounts. The ring mount was designed by both Elco and [[Bell Aircraft Company|Bell]], and designated Mark 17 Twin 50 caliber aircraft mount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORDNANCE PAMPHLET NO. 951|url=http://www.maritime.org/doc/pt/fifty/index.htm|publisher=maritime.org|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the Mark 17 Mod 1 and Mod 2 ring mount consisted of the Bell Mark 9 twin cradle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motor Torpedo Boat Manual|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/PT-Manual/index.html|publisher=Hyperwar Foundation|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twin .50 Cal Browning Navy Aircraft Mount MK9|url=http://www.cranetechnologiesinc.com/Twin50CalBrowningNavyACMountMK9.html|publisher=Crane Technologies|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another automatic weapon commonly mounted on PT boats was the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&amp;nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] cannon. On early series of boats, this cannon was mounted on the stern. Later in the war, several more of these 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannons were added amidships and on the forward deck.

Forward of the chart house of some early Elco {{convert|77|ft|m|adj=on}} boats (PT20 through PT44) were twin .30 cal (7.62&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Lewis Gun|Lewis]] machine guns on pedestal mounts. Beginning in mid-1943, some boats were fitted with one or two .30 cal Browning machine guns on the forward torpedo racks on pedestal mounts.

Occasionally, some front line PT boats received ''ad hoc'' up-fits at forward bases, where they mounted such weapons as 37mm aircraft cannons, rocket launchers, or mortars. When these weapons were found to be successful, they were incorporated onto the PT boats as original armament. One such field modification was made to Kennedy's ''PT-109'', which was equipped with a single-shot Army M3 [[37 mm Gun M3|37mm anti-tank gun]] that her crew had commandeered; they removed the wheels and lashed it to 2x8 timbers placed on the bow only one night before she was lost.  The larger punch of the 37mm round was desirable, but the crews looked for something that could fire faster than the single-shot army anti-tank weapon. Their answer was found in the 37mm [[Oldsmobile]] [[M4 cannon|M4]] aircraft automatic cannon cannibalized from crashed [[P-39 Airacobra]] fighter planes on Henderson Field, [[Guadalcanal]]. After having demonstrated its value on board PT boats, the M4 (and later M9) cannon was installed at the factory. The M4/M9 37mm auto cannon had a relatively high rate of fire (125 rounds per minute) and large [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] (30 rounds). These features made it highly desirable due to the PT boat's ever-increasing requirement for increased firepower to deal effectively with the Japanese [[Daihatsu-class landing craft|''Daihatsu''-class barges]], which were largely immune to torpedoes due to their shallow [[Draft (hull)|draft]]. By the war's end, most PTs had these weapons.

The installation of larger-bore cannons culminated in the fitting of the [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40mm Bofors gun]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WAR DEPARTMENT TECHNICAL MANUAL TM 9-252|url=http://www.maritime.org/doc/boforstm252/index.htm|publisher=maritime.org|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the aft deck. Starting in mid-1943, the installation of this gun had an immediate positive effect on the firepower available from a PT boat. The Bofors cannon had a firing rate of 120 rounds/min (using 4-round clips) and had a range of {{convert|5420|yd|m}}. This gun was served by a crew of 4 men, and was used against aircraft targets, as well as shore bombardment or enemy surface craft.

===Gunboats===
In the Solomon Islands in 1943, three {{convert|77|ft|m|adj=on}} PT boats, ''PT-59'', ''PT-60'', and ''PT-61'', were converted into &quot;PT gunboats&quot; by stripping them of all original armament except the two twin .50 cal (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) gun mounts, then adding two 40mm and four twin .50 cal (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) mounts. Lieutenant Kennedy was the first commanding officer of ''PT-59'' after its conversion. On 2 November 1943, ''PT-59'' participated in the rescue of 40 to 50 [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] from [[Choiseul Island]] and a foundering landing craft (LCP(R)) which was under fire from Japanese soldiers on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, Robert J. ''PT-109: John F. Kennedy in WW II'', pp 176–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the war, beginning in 1945, PTs received two eight-cell Mark 50 rocket launchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocket Launcher Mark 50|url=http://www.maritime.org/doc/launchers/cat-0165.htm|publisher=maritime.org|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} spin-stabilized flat trajectory Mark 7 and/or Mark 10 Rockets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Explosive Ordnance|url=http://www.maritime.org/doc/ordnance/pg172.htm|publisher=maritime.org|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with a range of {{convert|11000|yd|m}}. These 16 rockets plus 16 reloads gave them as much firepower as a destroyer's {{convert|5|in|mm|adj = on}} guns. By war's end, the PT boat had more &quot;firepower-per-ton&quot; than any other vessel in the U.S. Navy.

PT boats also commonly carried between two and eight U.S. Navy Mark 6 [[depth charge]]s in roll-off racks. Sometimes they were used as a last-ditch weapon to deter pursuing destroyers. The depth charge could be set to go off at {{convert|100|ft}}, and by the time it exploded, the pursuing destroyer might be above it.

Additionally, a few PT boats were equipped to carry naval mines launched from [[Naval mine|mine]] racks, but these were not in common use.

==Engines==
With the exception of the experimental PT boats, all U.S. PT boats were powered by three marine modified derivations of the [[Packard 1A-2500|Packard 3A-2500]] V-12 liquid-cooled, gasoline-fueled aircraft engine. Improvements upon Packard's World War I [[Liberty L-12]] 2A engine, the successive &quot;M&quot; for &quot;marine&quot; designated 3M-2500, 4M-2500, and 5M-2500 generations all featured slight changes and more power. Their [[supercharger]]s, [[intercooler]]s, dual [[ignition magneto|magneto]]s, and two [[spark plug]]s per cylinder reflected their aircraft origins.

Packard's licensed manufacture of the famed [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] aircraft engine for the [[P-51]] Mustang alongside the marine 4M-2500 has long been a source of confusion.  Only the British built ''PT-9'' prototype boat brought from England for Elco to examine and copy featured a Merlin.

The 4M-2500 initially generated 1200 [[horsepower|hp]] (895&amp;nbsp;kW), three roughly equaling the power of a [[Boeing B-17]] bomber. It was subsequently upgraded in stages to 1500 [[horsepower|hp]] (1,150&amp;nbsp;kW), allowing a designed speed of 41 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] ({{convert|76|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}). The 5M-2500 introduced in late 1945 had a larger supercharger, aftercooler, and increased power output of 1850&amp;nbsp;hp. It could push fully loaded boats at 45 to 50 knots (51-57&amp;nbsp;mph). However, subsequent additions of weaponry offset this potential increase in top speed.

Fuel consumption of any version of these engines was exceptionally heavy.  A PT boat carried 3,000 gallons (11,360 liters) of 100 [[octane]] [[aviation fuel]], enough for an 4M-2500 equipped boat to conduct a maximum 12-hour patrol. Some 200 gallons [760 l] an hour were consumed at a cruising speed of 23 knots, increasing to 500 gallons [1,890 l] per hour at top speed. Hull fouling and engine wear could both decrease top speed and increase fuel consumption materially.

==Service==
PT boats operated in the southern, western, and northern Pacific, as well as in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the English Channel.

===Early use===
[[File:USS Hornet with PT-28 and PT-29.jpg|thumb|left|267px|[[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS ''Hornet'']] with ''PT-28'' and ''PT-29'']]

Originally conceived as anti-ship weapons, PT boats were publicly credited with sinking several Japanese warships during the period between December 1941 and the fall of the Philippines in May 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;&gt;Robert J. Bulkley, At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy (Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Attacking at night, PT crews may have sometimes failed to note a possible torpedo failure. Although the American [[Mark 8 torpedo]] did have problems with porpoising and circular runs, it could and did have success against common classes of targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;/&gt; The [[Mark 3 exploder|Mark 3]] and [[Mark 4 exploder]]s were not subject to the same problems as the [[Mark 6 exploder]]s on U.S. submarines' [[Mark 14 torpedo]]es. Introduction of the [[Mark 13 torpedo]] to PT boats in mid-1943 all but eliminated the early problems that PT boats had with their obsolete Mark 8s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;/&gt;

===Night attacks===
PTs would usually attack at night. The cockpits of PT boats were protected against small arms fire and splinters by armor plate. Direct hits from Japanese guns could and did result in catastrophic gasoline explosions with near-total crew loss.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} They feared attack by Japanese seaplanes, which were hard to detect even with radar, but which could easily spot the phosphorescent wake left by PT propellers. Bombing attacks killed and wounded crews even with near misses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;/&gt; There are several recorded instances of PT boats trading fire with friendly aircraft,&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;/&gt; a situation also familiar to U.S. submariners. Several PT boats were lost due to &quot;friendly fire&quot; from both Allied aircraft and destroyers.&lt;!-- An example of such being PT boat 346, lost to 'friendly fire' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Torpedo_Boat_PT-346 --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;/&gt;

Initially, only a few boats were issued primitive radar sets. U.S. Navy PTs were eventually fitted with [[Raytheon]] [[radar|SO radar]], which had about a 17 [[nautical mile|nm]] range. Having radar gave Navy PTs a distinct advantage in intercepting enemy supply barges and ships at night. As more PTs were fitted with dependable radar, they developed superior night-fighting tactics and used them to locate and destroy many enemy targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;/&gt; During the Guadalcanal and Solomon Island campaigns in 1942–1943, the PT boats of Squadrons (RON) 2, 3, 5 and 6 would lie in wait to ambush a target from torpedo range, generally about {{convert|1000|yd|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;/&gt;

[[File:PT boat New Guinea 1943.jpg|thumb|right|275px|An {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Electric Launch Company|Elco]] PT boat on patrol off the coast of [[New Guinea]], 1943]]

During some of these nighttime attacks, PT boat positions may have been given away by a flash of light caused by grease inside the black-powder-actuated Mark VIII torpedo tubes catching fire during the launching sequence. In order to evade return fire from the enemy ships, the PT boat could deploy a [[smoke screen]] using stern-mounted [[Smoke screen#Smoke generators|generators]]. Starting in mid-1943 and thereafter, the old black powder-actuated Mk13 torpedo tubes loaded with Mark 8 torpedoes were removed and replaced with a newer style of torpedo launcher. The new Mark 1 &quot;roll-off&quot; torpedo launcher rack (which was loaded with an improved Mark 13 aerial torpedo) effectively eliminated the telltale flash of light from burning grease. The new launcher did not use any form of explosive to launch the torpedo, and weighed about {{convert|1000|lb}} less than the old tube style launchers.

Enemy forces would use searchlights or seaplane-dropped flares to illuminate fleeing PT boats.

===Solomon Islands campaign===
The effectiveness of PT boats in the Solomon Islands campaign, where there were numerous engagements between PTs and capital ships as well as against Japanese shipborne resupply efforts dubbed &quot;The [[Tokyo Express]]&quot; operating in [[New Georgia Sound]] (called &quot;the Slot&quot; by the Americans involved in the fighting) was substantially undermined by defective Mark 8 torpedoes. The Japanese were initially cautious when operating their [[capital ship]]s in areas known to have PT boats, since they knew how dangerous their own [[Type 93 torpedo]]es were, and assumed the Americans had equally lethal weapons. The PT boats at Guadalcanal were given credit for several sinkings and successes against the vaunted Tokyo Express. In several engagements, the mere presence of PTs was sufficient to disrupt heavily escorted Japanese resupply activities at [[Guadalcanal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;/&gt; Afterwards, the PT mission in the Solomon Islands was deemed a success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;/&gt;

===D-Day invasion===
Some served during the [[Normandy Landings|Battle of Normandy]]. During the D-Day invasion, PTs patrolled the &quot;Mason Line&quot;, forming a barrier against the German [[E boat|S-boats]] attacking the Allied landing forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert J. Bulkley 1962&quot;/&gt; They also performed lifesaving and anti-shipping mine destruction missions during the invasion.

[[File:PT-Boat-50cal.jpg|thumb|left|215px|PT boat gunner mans a twin .50 caliber Browning [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 machine gun]] off New Guinea.]]

===Barge attacks===
Perhaps the most effective use of PTs was as &quot;barge busters&quot;. Since both the Japanese in the New Guinea area and the Germans in the Mediterranean had lost numerous resupply vessels to Allied air power during daylight hours, each attempted to resupply their troop concentrations by using shallow draft barges at night in very shallow waters. The shallow depth meant Allied destroyers were unable to follow them due to the risk of running aground and the barges could be protected by an umbrella of shore batteries.

The efficiency of the PT boats at sinking the Japanese supply barges was considered a key reason that the Japanese had severe food, ammunition, and replacement problems during the New Guinea and Solomon Island campaigns, and made the PT boats prime targets for enemy aircraft. The use of PT boat torpedoes was ineffective against these sometimes heavily armed barges, since the minimum depth setting of the torpedo was about 10 feet (3 m) and the barges only drew 5 feet (1.5 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

To accomplish the task, PTs in the Mediterranean and the Pacific (and [[Royal Navy|RN]] and [[Royal Canadian Navy|RCN]] [[Motor Torpedo Boat|MTBs]] in the Mediterranean) installed more and heavier guns which were able to sink the barges. One captured Japanese soldier's diary described their fear of PT boats by describing them as &quot;the monster that roars, flaps its wings, and shoots torpedoes in all directions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Though their primary mission continued to be attack on surface ships and craft, PT boats were also used effectively to lay mines and smoke screens, coordinate in [[air-sea rescue]] operations, rescue shipwreck survivors, destroy Japanese [[Japanese Special Attack Units|suicide]] boats, destroy floating mines, and to carry out intelligence or raider operations.

After the war, American military interviews with captured veterans of the Imperial Japanese Navy, supplemented by the available partial Japanese war records, were unable to verify that all the PT boat sinking claims were valid.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Like many other victory claims by all parties involved (aircraft pilots, surface ships, submarines) this unclear verification was due in part to the Japanese military's policies of destroying military records.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Repair training===
In 1944, several Higgins {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=on}} boats (''PT222'', ''PT-283'', ''PT-284'', ''PT-285'', and ''PT-282'') were converted, releasing ''PT-59'', ''PT-60'', and ''PT-61'' for transfer back home to the [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center]] (MTBSTC) school in [[Melville, Rhode Island]] for use in training in hull repair techniques.

==Supply==
PT boats lacked a large capacity refrigerator to store sufficient quantities of perishable foods. While docked, PT boat squadrons were supported by PT boat tenders or base facilities which supplied boat crews with hot meals. As PT boats were usually located near the end of the supply chain, their crews proved resourceful in bartering with nearby ships or military units for supplies and using munitions to harvest their own fish.

Many PT boats became famous during and after World War II:
*''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-41|PT-41]]'', commanded by Lieutenant [[John D. Bulkeley]], carried General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in his escape from [[Corregidor Island]], Philippines. Bulkeley was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his operations in the Philippines before rescuing MacArthur. Bulkeley's story inspired a book and the movie ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' based on it. ''PT-41'' was the flagship of [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three]] (MTBRON&amp;nbsp;3), based in the [[Philippine Islands]] 1941–1942 (''PT-41, −31, −32, −33, −34, −35'').
*[[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] published an article about the PT boat captains in the battles off [[Guadalcanal]], featuring the exploits of Lieutenants &quot;Stilly&quot; Taylor, Leonard A. Nikoloric, Lester Gamble, and Robert and John Searles; the article mentioned many boats in MTB [[Squadron (naval)|Squadron]]s [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Two (United States)|Two]] and [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Five (United States)|Five]] (in particular, ''PT-36'', ''PT-37'', ''PT-39'', ''PT-44'', ''PT-46'', ''PT-48'', ''[[PT-59]]'', ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]'', ''PT-115'', and ''PT-123'').
*Other PT boats gaining fame during the war were ''PT-363'' and ''PT-489'', the boats used by [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Arthur Murray Preston|Murray Preston]] to rescue a downed aviator in Wasile Bay,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptboats.org/20-07-05-reports-007.html PT Boats, Inc.- Action Report – Into Action, Southwest Pacific  Return to the Philippines]. Ptboats.org (15 September 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; off Halmahera Island, for which Preston was awarded the Medal of Honor.
*''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]'', commanded by future [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], was made famous through [[Robert J. Donovan]]'s 1961 book '' PT-109: John F. Kennedy in World War II'' and the 1963 film based on it, [[PT 109 (film)|''PT 109'']].
*PT-157: Commanded by Lieutenant, junior grade, William F. 'Bud' Liebenow, Rescued crew of PT-109, Details in book &quot;FIRST-UP: Chronicles of the PT-157&quot;
*[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-59|''PT-59'']]: Commanded by Lieutenant, junior grade, John F. Kennedy after the loss of ''PT-109''
*''PT-105'': Commanded by Lieutenant Dick Keresey at the time of the loss of ''PT-109''. Keresey wrote a book by the same name.
*''PT-373'': Commanded by Lieutenant Belton A. Copp was the first boat, of a two boat squadron, to enter Manila Harbor in order to &quot;test defenses&quot; since the U.S. retreat in 1942.  General McArthur honored LT Copp and the crew of ''PT-373'' by using it to carry him back into Manila Harbor on 2 March 1945.

== Losses ==
According to the book ''&quot;At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;(R J Bulkley, ISBN 978-1-907521-07-2, pages 10, 43, 97)&lt;/ref&gt; 99 of the 531 PT boats that served during World War II were lost to various causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptboats.org/20-11-05-fate-001.html Fate of PT Boats at PT Boats Inc].

==Remaining boats==
At the end of the war, almost all surviving U.S. PT boats were disposed of shortly after [[V-J Day]]. Hundreds of boats were deliberately stripped of all useful equipment and then dragged up on the beach and burned. This was done to minimize the amount of upkeep the Navy would have to do, since wooden boats require much continuous maintenance, and they were not considered worth the effort. The boats also used a lot of high octane gasoline for their size, making them too expensive to operate for a peacetime navy. Much of this destruction (121 boats) occurred at PT Base 17, on [[Samar]], Philippines, near Bobon Point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptboats.org/20-11-05-fate-001.html PT Boat burning – November &amp; December 1945 – Samar, Philippines PT Boats Inc]. Ptboats.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few (one 80' Elco, one 72' Vosper, and three 78' Higgins) were cut up and destroyed between 1998 and 2008, leaving (a known) total of 12 PT boats, and 2 experimental PT boat hulls in various states of repair, surviving today in the U.S.:

;''PT-48''
''PT-48'' is possibly the last surviving {{convert|77|ft|m|adj=on}} Elco PT boat. In July 1942, ''PT-48'' (nicknamed &quot;Prep Tom&quot; and &quot;Deuce&quot;) was assigned to MTBRON&amp;nbsp;3. This second Squadron 3 was the first to arrive in the Solomons and saw heavy engagement with the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot;. PT 48 was one of the first 4 boats to arrive at Tulagi, on 12 October 1942. On the night of 13/14 October 1942, PT-48 engaged a Japanese destroyer at {{convert|200|yd|m}}. This Squadron saw action in the Solomon Islands, Guadalcanal, and Funafuti.  ''PT-48'' is today in need of major restoration, after having been cut down to {{convert|59|ft}} and used as a dinner cruise boat.  Because of this boat's extensive combat history, having survived 22 months in the combat zone at Guadalcanal (more time in combat than any other surviving PT boat), a preservation group, &quot;Fleet Obsolete&quot; of [[Kingston, New York]], acquired and transported it to [[Rondout Creek]] in 2008 for eventual repair.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

;''PT-305''
''PT-305'' (&quot;Half Hitch&quot;,&quot;Barfly&quot;, &quot;USS Sudden Jerk&quot;) is a Higgins {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=on}} boat, assigned during the war to RON22, and saw action against the Germans in the Mediterranean Sea. Squadron 22 was operating with the British [[Royal Navy Coastal Forces]], and saw action along the northwest coast of Italy and southern coast of France. In June 1945 the squadron was shipped to the U.S. for refitting and transfer to the Pacific, but the war ended while still in New York. The ''PT-305'' was cut down to {{convert|65|ft}} for use as an oyster seed boat in [[Crisfield, Maryland]]. ''PT-305'' was acquired by the Defenders of America Naval Museum (DOANM), and then sold in May 2007 to the [[National World War II Museum]] in [[New Orleans]]. ''PT-305'' is undergoing restoration (as of 2016) to become a seaworthy, operational vessel on Lake Pontchartrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganey|first=Terry|title=THE SAGA OF PT 305|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2009/nov/08/pt-305/|publisher=Columbia Daily Tribune|accessdate=23 July 2012|date=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FEATURED ARTIFACT: PT-305|url=http://www.nationalww2museum.org/exhibitions/the-national-world-war-ii.html|publisher=National WWII Museum|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''PT-309''
A {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=on}} Higgins, PT-309 (&quot;Oh Frankie!&quot;) was assigned during the war to RON22, and saw action against the Germans in the Mediterranean Sea. The squadron was operating under the British Coastal Forces, and saw action along the northwest cost of Italy and southern coast of France. In April 1945 the squadron was shipped to the U.S. for refitting and transfer to the Pacific, but the war ended while still in New York. Coincidentally, the ''PT-309'' (&quot;Oh Frankie!&quot;), was named in honor of Frank Sinatra, with whom the boats' Commanding Officer met at a nightclub shortly before MTBRON&amp;nbsp;22 left New York for the Mediterranean Theatre. ''PT-309'' is located at the [[National Museum of the Pacific War]] / Admiral Nimitz Museum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificwarmuseum.org/ National Museum of the Pacific War official site]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Fredericksburg, Texas]], and was restored by the (now defunct) Defenders of America Naval Museum (DOANM). ''PT-309'' is restored (but non-operational) in a static diorama display without engines installed. Her external restoration was completed by the Texas group in 2002, and is to a high standard.

;''PT-459''
''PT-459'' (&quot;Mahogany Menace&quot;) a Higgins {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=on}} boat, was assigned to MTBRON&amp;nbsp;30 on 15 February 1944 under the command of LCDR Robert L. Searles. MTBRON&amp;nbsp;30 saw action in the English Channel as part of the Invasion of Normandy. In late June 1945 the squadron was shipped to the U.S. for refitting and transfer to the Pacific, but the war ended while still in New York. After the war, the ex-PT459 was cut down to {{convert|65|ft|abbr=on}} and highly modified into a sightseeing boat and fishing trawler. She was acquired by Fleet Obsolete in June 2008 and moved to Kingston, New York for possible restoration.

;''PT-486''
''PT-486'', an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} Elco boat, was placed in service on 2 December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy by Captain Robert J. Bulkley, Jr. USNR (Retired) {{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used in the training squadron MTBRON&amp;nbsp;4 in Melville, Rhode Island during World War II until it was placed out of service 16 January 1946.  Along with PT-557, the vessel was purchased from BFM Industries (Brooklyn, NY) by Capt. George C. Sinn of Wildwood Crest, NJ on 9 October 1951 for $1,015.00.  The vessel was sold in 1952 to Otto Stocker who operated the &quot;Sightseer&quot; as an excursion vessel from Otten's Harbor in Wildwood, New Jersey.  The business was later sold to Capt. Charles Schumann in the 1980s.  He named the vessel Schumann's &quot;Big Blue&quot; and ran the business until 2002.  Remarkably, the PT486 was sold to the son of the original owner, Capt. Ronald G. Sinn, who in 2012 sold the boat to &quot;Fleet Obsolete&quot; of Kingston NY. Plans are for restoring the vessel to recreate the World War II appearance.

;''PT-615''
''PT-615'', an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} Elco originally assigned to RON 42, was commissioned after the war ended. ''PT-615'' was returned to Elco after being sold and was heavily modified into a yacht, which was leased to actor [[Clark Gable]]. He named the boat ''Tarbaby VI'', and used her through the 1950s. The boat was serviced and stored by Elco. She was sold several times, and moved to Kingston, NY for possible restoration.

;''PT-617''
''[[PT-617]]'' is an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} Elco boat located at the [[Battleship Cove]] Naval Museum in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]]. She was obtained from the backwaters of Florida and moved to its current location by JM &quot;Boats&quot; Newberry, the founder of PT Boats Inc. &quot;Boats&quot; along with the team at Battleship Cove Museum restored her during 1984–89, inside and out, at a cost of US$1 million. The boat is owned by PT Boats, Inc., a World War II PT veterans organization headquartered in [[Germantown, Tennessee]].
The quality of the restoration was extremely high, and the boat is on display inside a weatherproof building, on blocks out of the water. She is available for public viewing, and has portions of her hull cut away to display the cramped interior of the crew's quarters. General visitors are not allowed inside the boat in order to help preserve her historic integrity.

;''PT-657''
''PT-657'', a Higgins {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=on}} boat, has been converted into a charter fishing boat. She is located in San Diego and is now named ''Malahini''.

[[File:PT658 stbd view closeup.JPG|right|thumb|275px|[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-658|''PT-658'']] in Measure 31-20L Camouflage, May 2011, Portland, Oregon]]

;''PT-658''
Perhaps the best example of a surviving {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=on}} Higgins boat is [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-658|''PT-658'']], the only 100% authentically restored and operational U.S. Navy PT boat afloat today. Relaunched after hull restoration from 1995 to 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savetheptboatinc.com PT-658 Save the PT Boat website]&lt;/ref&gt; it is located at Pier 308, Vigor Shipyard in [[Portland, Oregon]]'s Swan Island Lagoon. Maintained by an all volunteer group, it is powered by the three Packard V12 5M-2500 gas engines&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7693407296698216570&amp;ei=8bLaSbL9OaryqAPa2OiHCw&amp;q=pt+658&amp;hl=en PT-658 under way video] PT 658 under way video&lt;/ref&gt; and includes all weapons, electronics, equipment and accessories restored to appear as they did the day the US Navy accepted the boat, July 31, 1945.

''PT-658'' was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;oreg-2012sep&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Parks|first=Casey|title=PT-658, last remaining operable PT boat from World War II, named to National Register of Historic Places |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|location=Portland, Oregon|date=7 September 2012 |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/09/pt-658_last_remaining_operable.html |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''PT-724''
''PT-724'', a surviving Vosper built at the Annapolis Boat yard in Maryland, has been used as a yacht, and has since been acquired by the Liberty Aviation Museum to be restored back to original Vosper configuration.

;''PT-728''
''PT-728'', a surviving Vosper boat built under license at the Annapolis Boat Yard in Maryland, was restored in [[Key West, Florida]]. Her deck house was reconfigured to partially resemble an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} Elco instead of its original Vosper {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} configuration. ''PT-728'' was acquired by Fleet Obsolete and moved to Kingston. There ''PT-728'' allows up to 49 tourists the chance to ride on a &quot;PT boat&quot;. This boat is the only U.S. Coast Guard regulation-approved PT boat licensed to take passengers for hire, and the only surviving U.S.-built Vosper design. In spring of 2012, ''PT-728'' was acquired by the Liberty Aircraft Museum of Port Clinton, OH for further restoration.

;''PT-796''
''[[PT-796]]'' (&quot;Tail Ender&quot;) is a {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=on}} Higgins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptboats.org/07-0-05-museum.html PT Boats, Inc.- Museum]. Ptboats.org.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war ended PT-796 was used in the Key West/Miami area for experimental purposes. She was retired from service in the late 1950s. Shortly after her retirement from service, the ''PT-796'' was used as a float during President John F. Kennedy's inaugural parade to represent ''PT-109'', with the ''PT-109'' hull number painted on the bow, and several of ''PT-109'''s surviving crew members manning the boat. Today, ''PT-796'' is located at the [[Battleship Cove]] Naval Museum in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] in a [[Quonset hut]]-style building, protected from the weather, and up on blocks.  The boat is owned by PT Boats, Inc., a World War II PT veterans organization headquartered in [[Germantown, Tennessee]].

===Experimental boats===
;{{anchor|PT-3}}''PT-3''
Two of the experimental PT-Boats also still survive, ''PT-3'' (built by Fisher Boat Works) in New Jersey and ''PT-8''. ''PT-3'' was designed by George Crouch and employed lightweight planing hull construction methods. A {{convert|59|ft|m|adj=on}} barrel-back (which provided increased strength to the sides and deck), a unique double longitudinal planked (mahogany outer planking and Port Orford cedar inner planking) lightweight hull on bent laminated oak framing, she was the &quot;featherweight&quot; of transportable PT boat design, but was later rejected by the Navy during trials in 1941 after being deemed too short to carry 4 torpedoes, as well as being able to only launch torpedoes stern first, which was a procedure considered too dangerous by BuOrd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptboatworld.com/PT_Boat_Info/PreWar.htm PT-3 and PT-8 Status]. Ptboatworld.com.&lt;/ref&gt; PT-3 and PT-8 were both part of Squadron 1 (RON 1) during the testing period. After testing was completed, PT-3 was transferred to Canada in April 1941 under lend-lease. PT-3 served with the RCAF Fleet as the RCAF Bras d'Or M413 (B119) based at Eastern Air Command in Halifax. She was transferred back to the United States in April 1945. Now located in a New Jersey boatyard in awaiting restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What should I do with this boat?|url=http://forum.woodenboat.com/showthread.php?164276-What-should-I-do-with-this-boat|work=WoodenBoat Forum|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''PT-8''
''PT-8'' (built at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard) in Louisiana was built entirely from aluminum but did not pass the speed acceptance criteria for use as a PT boat for the U.S. Navy due to its weight. She was reclassified as a harbor patrol boat (YP 110) for the duration of the war.

;''UK Vosper''
The two Vosper boats in England were built by Vosper itself, and the first is in fairly good condition at [[Portsmouth, England|Portsmouth]]. The second UK built boat is in private hands, floating on a canal north of London and being used as a private residence, though it is remarkably intact in its World War II configuration.

===Exported PT boats===
[[File:ARA Alakush.jpg|thumb|275px|ARA ''Alakush''. Ushuaia. 1962]]

Ten Higgins boats were delivered in 1948 for use by the [[Argentine Navy]] during the late 1940s up until the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histarmar.com.ar/Armada%20Argentina/Buques1900a1970/LanchasRapidas.htm Flota de Mar – Lanchas Rapidas]. Histarmar.com.ar.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these boats are now retired from naval use, with two still in civil use today as sightseeing boats on [[Mar del Plata]]: the ''Leonardo da Vinci'' and the ''Mar de la Plata''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histarmar.com.ar/HYAMNEWS/HyamNews2004/HY23-04LanchasHiggins.htm Lanchas Higgins]. Histarmar.&lt;/ref&gt; The other six boats are in various states of disrepair, sunk or scrapped.

The PT boat design was also exported after the end of the Second World War as an unarmed [[air-sea rescue]] launch for use by the [[South African Navy]].

== Movie stand-ins ==
The original 1962–66 ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' TV series used a Vosper design PT-694 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/05694.htm | title=Motor Torpedo Boat Photo Archive: PT-694 | publisher=NavSource Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to starring in the television series this boat was purchased as war surplus by [[Howard Hughes]] and was used as the camera chase boat when the ''[[Spruce Goose]]'' made its only flight. The stern of the Vosper boat is visible in the footage of that event.

In [[John Ford]]'s 1945 war film, ''[[They Were Expendable]]'', two 80-foot Elcos were used during filming along with four former RON 14 78-foot Huckins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ptboats.org/20-12-05-trivia-001.html | title=PT Boat Trivia | publisher=PT Boats, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1962 movie ''[[PT 109 (film)|PT-109]]'', several 82-foot USAF crash rescue boats were converted to resemble 80-foot Elcos when the few surviving boats were found to need too much work to make them seaworthy for use during the film.
