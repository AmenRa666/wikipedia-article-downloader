'''HMS ''Birkenhead''''', also referred to as '''HM Troopship ''Birkenhead''''' or '''Steam Frigate ''Birkenhead''''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucas&quot;/&gt; was one of the first iron-hulled ships built for the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fireside&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster |first=Roger |title=The Illustrated at the Fireside: True Southern African Stories |isbn=0-86486-558-9 |publisher=New Africa Books|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q1c9N2Ji3eAC&amp;pg=PA34 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was designed as a [[steam frigate]], but was converted to a [[troopship]] before being commissioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;iron&quot;/&gt;

She was wrecked on 26 February 1852, while transporting troops to [[Algoa Bay]] at Danger Point near [[Gansbaai]], 140 kilometres from [[Cape Town]], South Africa. There were not enough serviceable [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing the women and children to board the boats safely and escape the sinking.

Only 193 of the 643 people on board survived, and the soldiers' [[chivalry]] gave rise to the unofficial &quot;[[women and children first (protocol)|women and children first]]&quot; protocol when abandoning ship, while the &quot;Birkenhead drill&quot; of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem came to describe courage in face of hopeless circumstances.

==Description and history==
The ''Birkenhead'' was laid down at [[John Laird (shipbuilder)|John Laird]]'s shipyard at [[Birkenhead]] as the [[frigate]] HMS ''Vulcan'', but renamed soon after to ''Birkenhead'' after the town where she was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the Hundred of Wirral: With a Sketch of the City and County|author=Mortimer, William Williams |year=1847|publisher=Whittaker &amp; Co.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lMAMAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She had two {{convert|564|hp|kW}} [[steam engine]]s from Forrester &amp; Co that drove a pair of {{Convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} [[paddle wheel]]s, and two masts rigged as a [[brig]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iron&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warships&quot;/&gt;

According to her designer, John Laird:&lt;ref name=&quot;iron&quot;/&gt; {{bq|quote=The designs I submitted, and which were finally approved, were of a vessel {{convert|210|ft|m}} long (being about {{convert|20|ft|m}} longer than any vessel of her class had been built), and 37•6 [[beam (nautical)|beam]] with a displacement of 1918 tons on the [[waterline|load water-line]] of 15•9. The only change made by authorities at the [[Admiralty]] in these designs was the position of the paddle shaft, which they ordered to be moved several feet more forward; the change was unfortunate as it makes the vessel, unless due care is taken in stowing the hold, trim by the head. With this exception, I am answerable for the model, specification, displacement and general arrangement of the hull of the vessel.}}

The ship was divided into eight watertight compartments, while the engine room was divided by two longitudinal [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s into four compartments, making 12&amp;nbsp;watertight compartments in total.&lt;ref name=&quot;iron&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O-g3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA327 |journal=The Mechanics' Magazine, Register, Museum, Journal and Gazette|title=The Steam Frigate &quot;Birkenhead&quot; - Iron v Wood|author=[[Sholto Percy|Percy, Sholto]]; Nursery, Perry Fairfax |pages=327–29|date=3 January 1852|volume=LVI|publisher=Robertson &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She had a round [[stern]] and a [[bow (ship)|bow]] that ended in a large [[figurehead]] of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], holding a hammer in one hand, and some of &quot;the bolts of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]]&quot; that he had just forged in the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;heroes&quot;/&gt;  Her armament was originally intended to be two 96-pounder [[pivot gun]]s, one forward and the other aft, and four 68-pounder broadside guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;heroes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;There is no indication that this armament was ever fitted.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Launch ===
The ''Birkenhead'' was launched on 30 December 1845 by the [[Duke of Westminster|Marchioness of Westminster]].&lt;ref name=&quot;heroes&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/deathlessstoryor00addiiala|title=A Deathless Story, or The &quot;Birkenhead&quot; and its Heroes|year=1906|publisher=Hutchinson &amp; Co.|author1=Addison, A.C. |author2=Matthews, W.H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Times|date=2 January 1846|title=HMS Birkenhead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her hull then weighed 903 tons and drew {{convert|9.75|ft|m}}, although she was at this time missing approximately 15&amp;nbsp;tons of cabin fittings. Machinery, stores, and other fittings were expected to add an additional 1,000 or so tons, increasing her draught six more feet.&lt;ref name=&quot;iron&quot;/&gt;  She undertook her maiden voyage to Plymouth in 1846, averaging {{convert|12|knot|km/h}} to {{convert|13|knot|km/h}} for the journey.&lt;ref name=&quot;iron&quot;/&gt;

She remained laid up for some time, before being put to varied use around England, Scotland and Ireland. In November 1846, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s iron ship [[SS Great Britain|SS ''Great Britain'']] ran aground on the sands of [[Dundrum, County Down|Dundrum Bay]], Ireland. There was doubt as to whether she could be re-floated. Brunel advised that if anyone could rescue the ship then the man to do it was the naval engineer [[James Bremner]]. He was engaged and the ''Great Britain'' was re-floated on 27 August 1847 with the assistance of HMS ''Birkenhead''.&lt;ref name=&quot;warships&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Warships of the World to 1900 |author=Paine, Lincoln P. |year=2000 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books |isbn=0-395-98414-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh7CSxFeK-IC&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, the cost of the salvage bankrupted her owner, the Great Western Steamship Company, causing the ''Great Britain'' to be sold and turned into an emigration ship.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Birkenhead'' was never [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] as a frigate, as two factors came into play while she was still under construction, that resulted in her being converted into a [[troopship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iron&quot;/&gt;  Firstly, the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[warship]]s were switched from [[paddle wheel]]s to more efficient [[propeller]] propulsion, following an experiment organised by the [[Admiralty]] in 1845 in which the benefits of the propeller over the paddle wheel were dramatically demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorials.inportsmouth.co.uk/dockyard/rattler.htm|title=Portsmouth's Historic Dockyard - HMS Rattler|publisher=Memorials and Monuments in Portsmouth|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secondly, the Admiralty had doubts about the effects of [[cannon]] shot against iron [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s — in a number of trials carried out at [[Royal Arsenal]] in 1845, at lower velocities shot made a jagged hole that was hard to plug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy |publisher=Oxford University Press|author1=Hill, J. R. |author2=Ranft, Bryan |year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-860527-0}} (Includes a photograph of the ''Birkenhead'')&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of her conversion to a troopship in 1851, a [[forecastle]] and [[poop deck]] were added to the ''Birkenhead'' to increase her accommodation,&lt;ref name=&quot;iron&quot;/&gt; and a third mast added, to change her sail plan to a [[barquentine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;warships&quot;/&gt;  Although she never served as a [[warship]], she was faster and more comfortable than any of the wooden sail-driven [[troopship]]s of the time, making the trip from the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] in 37&amp;nbsp;days in October 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;iron&quot;/&gt;

In January 1852, under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Robert Salmond RN, the ''Birkenhead'' left [[Portsmouth]] conveying troops from ten different regiments,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dumpleton&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of the Paddle Steamer|author=Dumpleton, Bernard |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sGUs6qMt4nkC&amp;pg=PA176 |publisher=Intellect Books |isbn=978-1-84150-801-6 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot|74th Regiment of Foot]] and [[Queen's Royal Regiment]], to the [[Xhosa Wars#Eighth War|8th Xhosa War]] (then called the &quot;[[Kaffir (Historical usage in southern Africa)|Kaffir]] War&quot;) against the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] in South Africa. On 5 January, she picked up more soldiers at Queenstown (now [[Cobh]]), Ireland, and conveyed some officers' wives and families.

On 23 February 1852, ''Birkenhead'' docked briefly at [[Simonstown]], near [[Cape Town]]. Most of the women and children disembarked along with a number of sick soldiers. Nine cavalry horses, several bales of hay and 35&amp;nbsp;tons of coal were loaded for the last leg of the voyage to [[Algoa Bay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;heroes&quot;/&gt;

She sailed from [[Simonstown|Simon's Bay]] at 06:00 on 25 February 1852 with between 630&lt;ref name=annual&gt;{{cite book  | title = The Annual Register, Or, A View of the History and Politics of the Year 1852 | publisher = J.G. &amp; F.

In order to make the best possible speed, Captain Salmond decided to hug the South African coast, setting a course that was generally within {{Convert|3|mi|km}} of the shore. Using her [[paddle wheel]]s, she maintained a steady speed of {{convert|8.5|kn|km/h}}. The sea was calm and the night was clear as she left [[False Bay]] and headed east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dumpleton&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Wreck of the Birkenhead.jpg|thumb|250px|&quot;The Wreck of the ''Birkenhead''&quot; (ca 1892) by Thomas M Hemy.]]
Shortly before 02:00 on 26 February, while ''Birkenhead'' was travelling at a speed of {{convert|8|kn|km/h}}, the leadsman made [[sounding line|sounding]]s of {{Convert|12|fathom|m}}. Before he could take another sounding, she struck an uncharted rock at {{Coord|34|38|42|S|19|17|9|E|type:landmark_region:ZA|name=HMS Birkenhead|display=inline,title}} with {{Convert|2|fathom|m}} of water beneath her bows and {{Convert|11|fathom|m}} at her stern.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book|title=Shipwrecks and Salvage in South Africa|author=Turner, Malcolm |year=1988 |isbn=0-86977-387-9|publisher=C. Struik |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rock lies near Danger Point (today near [[Gansbaai]], [[Western Cape]]). Barely submerged, it is clearly visible in rough seas, but it is not immediately apparent in calmer conditions.

Captain Salmond rushed on deck and ordered the anchor to be dropped, the quarter-boats to be lowered, and a turn astern to be given by the engines. However, as the ship backed off the rock, the sea rushed into the large hole made by the collision and the ship struck again, buckling the plates of the forward bilge and ripping open the bulkheads. Shortly, the forward compartments and the engine rooms were flooded, and over 100 soldiers were drowned in their berths.&lt;ref name=annual/&gt;

=== Sinking ===
The surviving soldiers mustered and awaited their officers' orders. Salmond ordered Colonel Seton to send men to the [[chain pump]]s; sixty were directed to this task, sixty more were assigned to the [[block and tackle|tackles]] of the lifeboats, and the rest were assembled on the [[poop deck]] in order to raise the forward part of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallant&quot;/&gt; The women and children were placed in the ship's [[cutter (ship)|cutter]], which lay alongside. Two other boats were manned, but one was immediately swamped and the other could not be launched due to poor maintenance and paint on the winches, leaving only three boats available. The two large boats, with capacities of 150 men each, were not among them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucas&quot;/&gt;

The surviving officers and men assembled on deck, where [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Seton of the 74th Foot took charge of all military personnel and stressed the necessity of maintaining order and discipline to his officers. As a survivor later recounted: &quot;Almost everybody kept silent, indeed nothing was heard, but the kicking of the horses and the orders of Salmond, all given in a clear firm voice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucas&quot;/&gt;

[[File:The Wreck of the Birkenhead.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Wreck of the Birkenhead'' (1901) by [[Charles Dixon (artist)|Charles Dixon]].]]
Ten minutes after the first impact, the engines still turning astern, the ship struck again beneath the engine room, tearing open her bottom. She instantly broke in two just aft of the mainmast. The funnel went over the side and the forepart of the ship sank at once. The stern section, now crowded with men, floated for a few minutes before sinking.

Just before she sank, Salmond called out that &quot;all those who can swim jump overboard, and make for the boats&quot;. Colonel Seton, however, recognising that rushing the lifeboats would risk swamping them and endangering the women and children, ordered the men to stand fast, and only three men made the attempt. The [[cavalry]] horses were freed and driven into the sea in the hope that they might be able to swim ashore.

The soldiers did not move, even as the ship broke up barely 20&amp;nbsp;minutes after striking the rock. Some of the soldiers managed to swim the {{Convert|2|mi|km}} to shore over the next 12&amp;nbsp;hours, often hanging on to pieces of the wreck to stay afloat, but most drowned, died of exposure, or were killed by sharks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remained on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood that were on the water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. &lt;p&gt;- Letter from [[Lieutenant]] J.F. Girardot, [[43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot|43rd Light Infantry]], to his father, 1 March 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickens |first=Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LTMOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA89 |title=The Household Narrative of Current Events |year=1852 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The next morning, the [[schooner]] ''Lioness'' discovered one of the cutters, and after saving the occupants of the second boat made her way to the scene of the disaster. Arriving in the afternoon, she found 40 people still clinging to the rigging. It was reported that of the approximately 643&amp;nbsp;people aboard, only 193 were saved. Captain Edward WC Wright of the [[91st Regiment of Foot|91st Argyllshire Regiment]] was the most senior army officer to survive; he was awarded a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] majority for his actions during the ordeal, dated 26 February 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=John Murray, London|date=28 December 1858|title=Hart's Annual Army List 1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21448|startpage=1665|date=14 June 1853|accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of personnel aboard is in some doubt, but an estimate of 638 was published in ''[[The Times]]''. It is generally thought that the survivors comprised 113 soldiers (all ranks), 6 Royal Marines, 54&amp;nbsp;seamen (all ranks), 7&amp;nbsp;women, 13&amp;nbsp;children and at least one male civilian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~palmiped/Daly.htm|title=Charles Daly |publisher=Birkenhead Survivors |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010617075757/http://www.btinternet.com/~palmiped/Daly.htm |archivedate=17 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these numbers cannot be substantiated, as [[muster roll]]s and books were lost with the ship.

Of the horses, eight made it safely to land, while the ninth had its leg broken while being pushed into the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wreck of HM Steamer &quot;Birkenhead&quot; – 26 Feb 1852|url=http://capeinfo.com/more/myths-legends-a-old-folks-stories/568-the-wreck-of-hm-steamer-qbirkenheadq-26-feb-1852 |publisher=Capeinfo |accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
[[File:Danger Point lighthouse, Gansbaai.jpg|thumb|250px|The Danger Point [[lighthouse]], erected near [[Gansbaai, Western Cape|Gansbaai]] after the sinking.]]
A number of sailors were [[court martial]]led as a result of the accident. The court was held on 8 May 1852 on board [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] in Portsmouth, and attracted a great deal of interest. However, as none of the senior naval officers of the ''Birkenhead'' survived, no-one was found to be to blame.&lt;ref name=&quot;heroes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shipwreck&quot;/&gt;  [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] Edward WC Wright of the [[91st Regiment of Foot|91st Argyllshire Regiment]] told the court martial:&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallant&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Soldiers: Gallant Deeds of the British Army during Victoria's Reign|last=Kingston|first=William Henry Giles|year=1899|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23052|publisher=Nick Hodson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The order and regularity that prevailed on board, from the moment the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1895, a [[lighthouse]] was erected at Danger Point to warn shipping of the dangerous reef. The lighthouse is about {{Convert|18|m|ft}} tall and is visible for approximately {{convert|25|nmi|km}}. In 1936, a remembrance plate for the Birkenhead was affixed to its base by the Navy League of South Africa. A new Birkenhead memorial was erected nearby in March 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birkenhead.za.net/|title=Image Gallery |publisher=Birkenhead.za.net |accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2001, the plaque was moved closer to the lighthouse.

A memorial in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], [[Edinburgh]], bears the following inscription:

{{Quotation|In memory of Lieut.-Colonel Alexander Seton, Ensign Alex. C. Russell, and forty-eight N.C.O.s and men of the 74th Highlanders who were drowned at the wreck of H.M.S. 'Birkenhead' on the 26th February 1852, off Point Danger, Cape of Good Hope, after all the women and children on board had been safely landed in the ship's boats.}}

[[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was so impressed by the bravery and discipline of the soldiers that he ordered an account of the incident to be read at the head of every regiment in his army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=61|title=The History of the Second Queen's Royal Regiment|publisher=R.

===''Birkenhead'' drill===
The sinking of the ''Birkenhead'' is the earliest maritime disaster [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] during which the concept of &quot;[[women and children first (protocol)|women and children first]]&quot; is known to have been applied. &quot;Women and children first&quot; subsequently became standard procedure in relation to the evacuation of sinking ships, both in fiction and in real life. The synonymous &quot;''Birkenhead'' drill&quot; became an exemplar of courageous behaviour in hopeless circumstances, and appeared in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s 1893 tribute to the [[Royal Marines]], &quot;Soldier an' Sailor Too&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collected Verse of Rudyard Kipling|author=Kipling, Rudyard |year=2005|isbn=1-4179-0750-9|publisher=Kessinger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76QI2lskupEC&amp;pg=PA305 |pages=305–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To take your chance in the thick of a rush, with firing all about,&lt;br/&gt;
Is nothing so bad when you've cover to 'and, an' leave an' likin' to shout;&lt;br/&gt;
But to stand an' be still to the Birken'ead drill is a damn tough bullet to chew,&lt;br/&gt;
An' they done it, the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies -- soldier an' sailor too!&lt;br/&gt;
Their work was done when it 'adn't begun; they was younger nor me an' you;&lt;br/&gt;
Their choice it was plain between drownin' in 'eaps an' bein' mopped by the screw,&lt;br/&gt;
So they stood an' was still to the Birken'ead drill, soldier an' sailor too
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase also appears in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1956 ''[[Double Star]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;I knew I was sunk-but, damn it, if you are caught by the Birkenhead Drill, the least you owe yourself is to stand at attention while the ship goes down.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in [[David Weber]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Mutineers' Moon]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;And if he was caught in the Birkenhead Drill, he could at least try to do his best till the ship went down.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final voyage of the Birkenhead also forms the basis of the historical novel Shark Alley: The Memoirs of a Penny-a-Liner by Stephen Carver, in which a radical Victorian journalist recounts his life while travelling on the ship as a special correspondent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carver|first1=Stephen|title=Shark Alley: The Memoirs of a Penny-a-Liner|date=2016|publisher=Green Door Press|isbn=9781523935451|url=http://jackvincentpapers.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Birkenhead'' treasure===
[[File:Diver over the paddle shaft P4065278.JPG|thumb|250px|The paddle shaft of the wreck.]]
There is a persistent rumour that the ''Birkenhead'' was carrying a military [[payroll]] of £240,000 in gold coins&lt;ref name=&quot;shipwreck&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipwreck.co.za/birkenhead.html|publisher=Shipwreck.co.za|title=HMS Birkenhead 1852|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxearth.org.uk/1852BuryNorwichPost.html|title=1852 Bury and Norwich Post newspaper archive|year=1852|publisher=The Foxearth and District Local History Society|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; weighing about three tons, which had been secretly stored in the [[magazine (artillery)|powder-room]] before the final voyage.

Numerous attempts have been made to salvage the gold. In 1893, the nephew of Colonel Seton wrote that a certain Mr. Bandmann at the Cape obtained permission from the Cape Government to dive the wreck of the ''Birkenhead'' in search of the treasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;heroes&quot;/&gt;  A June 1958 salvage attempt by a renowned Cape Town diver recovered anchors and some brass fittings, but no gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birkenhead.za.net/|title=The Treasure |publisher=Birkenhead.za.net |accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986-1988, a combined archaeological and salvage excavation was carried out by Aqua Exploration, Depth Recovery Unit and Pentow Marine Salvage Company. Only a few gold coins were recovered, which appear to have been the personal possessions of the passengers and crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipwreck&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Salvage of the Birkenhead|last=Kayle|first=Allan|isbn=1-86812-260-3|publisher=South Book Publishers|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rumour of treasure and the shallow depth of the wreck at {{Convert|30|m|ft}} have resulted in the wreck being considerably disturbed over the years, despite its being a [[war grave]]. In 1989, the British and South African governments entered into an agreement over the salvage of the wreck, sharing any gold recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwiGPr3XQrAC&amp;pg=PA29|title=The Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage: Before and After the 2001 UNESCO Convention|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=2003|author1=Garabello, Roberta |author2=Scovazzi, Tullio |isbn=90-411-2203-6 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HMS ''Birkenhead'' as namesake===
Three placenames in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[British Columbia]] were conferred in honour of the ''Birkenhead'' disaster by [[Hudson's Bay Company]] explorer [[Alexander Caulfield Anderson]], a boyhood friend and cousin of Lt-Col. Seton of the [[74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot|74th Regiment of Foot]], on a traverse of uncharted country between the [[Fraser Canyon]] and the coastal [[Lower Mainland]] in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=British Columbia Place Names|publisher=Sono Nis Press
|isbn=0-919203-96-5|year=1986|author1=Akrigg, G. P. V. |author2=Akrigg, Helen B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Named after his cousin, [[Seton Lake]] cuts west through the [[Coast Mountains]] from the Fraser Canyon town of [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], beyond which is its twin [[Anderson Lake (British Columbia)|Anderson Lake]].

A few miles southwest from the head of Anderson Lake is Mount Birkenhead, on the north side of the low pass connecting the valley of those lakes to that of the [[Birkenhead River]]. The river, the valley area near Mount Birkenhead known as Birken, and Birkenhead Lake at the summit of the pass were in turn named after the mountain, and not directly by Anderson.

===Other name legacies===
According to local tradition, [[Salmonsdam Nature Reserve]] in the [[Overberg]] is named after Captain Robert Salmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capenature.org.za/reserves.htm?reserve=Salmonsdam+Nature+Reserve |title=Salmonsdam Nature Reserve |publisher=[[CapeNature]] |accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Locals to this day call [[great white shark|Great White Sharks]] &quot;Tommy Sharks&quot; after the [[Tommy Atkins|Tommys]] that were taken by them in water.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt;
