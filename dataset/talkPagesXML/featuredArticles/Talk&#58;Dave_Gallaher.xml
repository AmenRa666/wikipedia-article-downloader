== Description on Gallaher statue at Eden Park ==
This has been included in the article, however I'm worried that it may be copyright, or not fall under fair use? Does anyone know the copyright status of inscriptions on public works such as this? - [[User:Shudde|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;Shudde&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Shudde|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:39, 21 April 2013 (UTC)

I've removed the inscription until we find a reference. I'll leave it here for now. -- [[User:Shudde|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;Shudde&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Shudde|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:24, 21 October 2014 (UTC)

== Unverified statements ==
All the statements below were included in the ''First World War'' section of the article. But I've removed them as I can't find a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] for any of them. Taken from [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dave_Gallaher&amp;oldid=630470478].
*On enlisting Gallaher gave his date of birth as 31 Oct 1876 making him appear three years younger.
*Because of his past experience he was given the rank of Corporal
*On the 16 October 1916 he was promoted to Sergeant
*and by 20 January 1917 he was Company Sergeant Major.
From what I can tell, they are all facts from [http://www.katikati.co.nz/kk_text/anzac_gallaher_d.html http://www.katikati.co.nz/kk_text/anzac_gallaher_d.html], which has a biography written by Kay Carter. But I'm unsure if this is a reliable source, so have included it here until we can either find a more reliable source, or can establish that the website above is acceptable. -- [[User:Shudde|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;Shudde&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Shudde|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:49, 21 October 2014 (UTC)

== Possible lead section reordering ==
'''Dave Gallaher''' (born David Gallagher, 30{{nbsp}}October 1873 – 4{{nbsp}}October 1917) was a New Zealand [[rugby union]] footballer who has been inducted into the [[World Rugby Hall of Fame]], [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]], and the [[New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame]]. He first appeared for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand national team]] for their unbeaten tour of Australia in 1903, playing in New Zealand's first ever [[Test match (rugby union)|Test match]], against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in [[Sydney]]. He is best remembered, however, as the captain of the 1905–06 national team now known as the [[The Original All Blacks|Original All Blacks]]. The  Originals were the first New Zealand side to tour the British Isles. Under Gallaher's leadership  their tour of the British Isles, France, and North America resulted in 34 wins from 35 matches; the New Zealanders scored 976 points and conceded only 59. Before returning home he co-wrote with vice-captain [[Billy Stead]] the classic rugby text ''The Complete Rugby Footballer''. After the Originals' tour he retired as a player and took up coaching and [[Glossary of rugby union terms#Selector|selecting]], and was a selector for both [[Auckland rugby union team|Auckland]] and New Zealand for most of the following decade.

Although Gallaher's Originals helped to cement rugby as New Zealand's national sport, he was relentlessly criticised by the British press for his role as [[Thomas Ellison#Wing-forward|wing-forward]]. The use of a wing-forward, which the British felt was a tactic to deliberately obstruct opponents, contributed to decades of strains between the rugby authorities of New Zealand and the [[Home Nations]], until the [[World Rugby|International Rugby Football Board (IRFB)]] effectively banned the position in 1931.

Gallaher was born in [[Ramelton]], Ireland, and emigrated to New Zealand with his family as a child. After moving to [[Auckland]], in 1895 he joined [[Ponsonby RFC]] and was selected for his province in 1896. In 1901–02 he served with the [[List of New Zealand units in the Second Boer War|New Zealand Contingent]] in the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]].  During the [[World War I|First World War]], Gallaher enlisted in the [[New Zealand Division]] to fight in Europe; he was killed in 1917 at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] in Belgium. A number of memorials exist in Gallaher's honour, including the [[Gallaher Shield]] for the winner of Auckland's club championship, and the [[Dave Gallaher Trophy]] contested between the national teams of [[France national rugby union team|France]] and New Zealand.

== Record breaking jersey ==
I just saw [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-34486830 this article] stating that Gallaher's jersey from the 1905 Wales match has sold at auction for £180,000 making it the most expensive rugby jersey in the world. I think that deserves a mention, but I can't see what section to put it in. Thoughts? [[User:FruitMonkey|FruitMonkey]] ([[User talk:FruitMonkey|talk]]) 10:20, 10 October 2015 (UTC)
:Perhaps change &quot;Memorials&quot; to &quot;Memorials and legacy&quot; and put it in there. —&lt;span style=&quot;border:solid 0px;color:#fff;background:darkgreen;box-shadow:darkgray 0px 0px 3px&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Cliftonian|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff&quot;&gt;Cliftonian&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Cliftonian|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 10:37, 10 October 2015 (UTC)</text>
