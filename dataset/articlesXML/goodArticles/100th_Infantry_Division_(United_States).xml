The '''100th Division''' (formerly the '''100th Infantry Division''') is an [[infantry]] [[Division (military)|division]] of the [[United States Army]] headquartered at [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]]. It currently serves as a major training command of the [[United States Army Reserve]].

Throughout its long history, the division has taken on numerous roles. Serving as the 100th Infantry Division until the 1950s, the division then briefly became the '''100th Airborne Division''' before becoming the '''100th Division (Training)'''. Since this transformation, the division has primarily taken on numerous training roles for other Army units.

It was activated in mid 1918, too late to join the fighting in World War I. The division is best known for its exploits during World War II as the 100th Infantry Division. Fighting in the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]], the division advanced through France and Germany through the end of the war, fending off serious German counterattacks along the way. World War II would be the only war the division would fight in before taking on its role as a training unit.

==History==

===World War I===
The 100th Division was first constituted on 12 July 1918 in the [[National Army (USA)|National Army]]. It was organized in October of that year at [[Camp Bowie]], Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Lineage and Honors Information: 100th Infantry Division |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/div/100d.htm |publisher=US Army Center of Military History |accessdate=22 May 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5h5lh6SBP?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.history.army.mil%2Fhtml%2Fforcestruc%2Flineages%2Fbranches%2Fdiv%2F100d.htm |archivedate=27 May 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was assigned the [[199th Infantry Brigade]] commanding the [[397th Infantry Regiment (United States)|397th Infantry Regiment]], the [[398th Infantry Regiment (United States)|398th Infantry Regiment]] and the [[200th Infantry Brigade]], commanding the [[399th Infantry Regiment (United States)|399th Infantry Regiment]] and the [[400th Infantry Regiment (United States)|400th Infantry Regiment]]. Each brigade commanded around 8,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath175&quot;&gt;McGrath, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The division then began preparations to deploy to Europe and join the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] in combating the [[Central Powers]] during World War I. Before the division could deploy, though, the war ended on 11 November 1918, [[Armistice Day]]. The 100th Division then began demobilization as part of the post-war drawdown of the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;/&gt;

It would remain on the U.S. Army's roll until November 1919, when it was completely demobilized. Only two years later, in June 1921, the division was reconstituted with its headquarters in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], West Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;/&gt; On 29 May 1923, the division received its [[shoulder sleeve insignia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIOH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Div/100TrainingDivision.htm |title=The Institute of Heraldry: 100th Infantry Division |publisher=[[The Institute of Heraldry]] |accessdate=29 May 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hBoxIwzZ?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil%2FDiv%2F100TrainingDivision.htm |archivedate=31 May 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its interwar years, the division saw little service. Its location was changed in 1924 to [[Huntington, West Virginia]] and was changed again in 1937 to [[Charleston, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;/&gt;

In 1940, the 199th and 200th Infantry Brigade headquarters were disbanded, and the division was placed in command of the 397th, 398th, and 399th Infantry Regiments directly; the 400th Infantry Regiment was inactivated.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath175&quot;/&gt;

===World War II===

====Mobilization====
The 100th Infantry Division was reactivated in the active duty force on 15 November 1942 at [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;/&gt;  Enlisted personnel were primarily original members of the unit, fleshed out by fillers from the [[76th Infantry Division (United States)|76th Infantry Division]]. The Officers were mostly members of the unit, again fleshed out with fillers from the Organized Reserves.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/100d.htm|title=GlobalSecurity.org: 100th Infantry Division |work=[[Globalsecurity]]|accessdate=7 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090613231850/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/100d.htm| archivedate= 13 June 2009 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commander of the 100th was [[Major General]] [[Withers A. Burress]], one of only eleven generals who commanded their divisions for the entire war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order374&quot; /&gt;

From late 1943 to early 1944, the division trained in the mountains of [[Tennessee]] and was subsequently sent to [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina|Fort Bragg]], North Carolina, for further training.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt;  While at Fort Bragg, [[Technical Sergeant]] Walter L. Bull earned the first [[Expert Infantryman's Badge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt;

The division remained organized around the 397th, 398th and 399th Infantry Regiments, and was also assigned the 374th Artillery Battalion, the 375th Artillery Battalion, the 925th Artillery Battalion, and the 373rd Artillery Battalion for [[artillery]] support, as well as the 325th Engineer Combat Battalion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.100thww2.org/linhon/325the.html 325th Engineer Combat Battalion Lineage] &quot;Ordered into active military service 15 November 1942 and reorganized at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, as the 325th Engineer Combat Battalion. &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the 325th Medical Battalion, the 100th Military Police Company, the 100th Quartermaster Company, the 800th Ordnance Company, the 100th Reconnaissance Cavalry Troop and the 100th Signals Company.&lt;ref&gt;''Almanac'', p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;

The division sailed to Europe on 6 October of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;&gt;''Almanac'', p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt; The division arrived at [[Marseille]], France on 20 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt; It was made part of [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] of the [[Seventh United States Army]], [[Sixth United States Army Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Order378&quot;/&gt;

====European Theater====
As soon as the division was prepared for combat, it began moving into the [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] region,&lt;ref name=&quot;Order379&quot;&gt;''Order of Battle'', p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; and sent its first elements into combat at [[Saint-Remy, Vosges|St. Remy]] in the [[Vosges Mountains]] on 1 November 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt;  The division as a whole began the relief of the [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]] at [[Baccarat, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Baccarat]] on 5 November, and assumed control of the sector on 9 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt;  The attack jumped off on 12 November, and the division drove against the German [[Winter Line]] in the [[Vosges Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt;  The 100th took [[Bertrichamps]] and [[Clairupt]], pierced the German line, and seized [[Raon-l'Étape]] and Saint-Blaise-[[Moyenmoutier]] between 16 and 26 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt; Later in November the division moved into the [[Vosges]] region,&lt;ref name=&quot;Order379&quot;/&gt; elements assisted in holding the [[Saverne Gap]] bridgehead while the bulk of the division went into reserve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt; The unit was relieved from assignment to VI Corps and transferred to the US [[XV Corps (United States)|XV Corps]] on 27 November 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order378&quot;&gt;''Order of Battle'', p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; It then moved into the [[Moselle]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order379&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Bitsch 036.jpg|The citadel of [[Bitche]], France|thumb]]
In December 1944, the division went on the offensive in the vicinity of [[Bitche]], France. The division occupied the nearby areas of [[Wingen, Bas-Rhin|Wingen]] and [[Lemberg]] after fierce fighting on 6–10 December. The division then advanced to [[Reyersweiler]], which fell after fighting on 11–13 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt;  Fort Schiesseck, a major defensive work in the region, capitulated after a heavy assault by the 100th on 20 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt; The division was ordered to halt its attack and to hold defensive positions south of [[Bitche]] as part of the [[Seventh United States Army|Seventh Army]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt; Thanks to a stout defense, the men of the 100th later became known as the &quot;Sons of Bitche&quot;. The German counterattacks of 1 and 8–10 January 1945 were repulsed, after heavy fighting at Bitche. After further attacks stalled and the Germans began to withdraw, the sector was generally quiet and the division prepared to resume its offensive east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt;

On 15 March 1945, the attack jumped off and on 16 March, Bitche fell to the 100th Infantry Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt; The unit was then relieved from assignment to XV Corps, and transferred to [[XXI Corps (United States)|XXI Corps]] on 22 March 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order378&quot;/&gt; Taking [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße|Neustadt]] and [[Ludwigshafen]], the division reached the [[Rhine River]] on 24 March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt; On 25 March 1945, the unit was returned from XXI Corps back to VI Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order378&quot;/&gt; On 31 March 1945, the 100th Infantry Division crossed the Rhine and moved south in the wake of the [[10th Armored Division (United States)|10th Armored Division]] and then east across the [[Neckar River]], establishing and enlarging a bridgehead from 4 to 11 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt; [[Heilbronn]] fell after [[Battle of Heilbronn (1945)|nine days of house-to-house combat]] on 12 April and the division resumed its rapid pursuit of the enemy, reaching [[Stuttgart]] by 21 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt; The 100th was mopping up along the Neckar, southeast of Stuttgart on 23 April, when it was removed from VI Corps and assigned directly to the Seventh United States Army as an Echelon Above Corps Asset.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order378&quot;/&gt; The division was then assigned primarily to patrolling the sector east of [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac569&quot;&gt;''Almanac'', p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting to [[Göppingen]] on 30 April, the Division engaged in occupational duties as the war in Europe came to an end on [[V-E Day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac569&quot;/&gt;

The division spent 163 days in combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order375&quot;&gt;''Order of Battle'', p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, it suffered 12,215 casualties, including 933 [[killed in action]], 3,667 [[wounded in action]], 589 [[missing in action]], 1 [[prisoner of war]], as well as 7,425 non-battle casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order375&quot;/&gt; The division took 13,351 prisoners of war on its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order375&quot;/&gt; Members of the division won three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]], seven [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Crosses]], five [[Legions of Merit]], 492 [[Silver Star Medal]]s, 23 [[Soldier's Medal]]s, 5,156 [[Bronze Star Medal]]s, and 90 [[Air Medal]]s. The division itself was awarded three [[campaign streamers]] for participation in the campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order375&quot;/&gt;

100th Infantry Division returned to the United States via the [[Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation]] on 10 January 1946, and was released from active duty at [[Camp Patrick Henry]], [[Virginia]] that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac568&quot;/&gt; The division then began the process of [[demobilization]], before inactivating on 26 January.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;/&gt;

===Cold War===
In fall of 1946, the division was reactivated in the [[U.S. Army Reserve]] as the 100th Airborne Division in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;/&gt; This distinction as one of the few [[airborne warfare|airborne]] divisions within the U.S. Army was brief; in 1952 the division was once again redesignated the 100th Infantry Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;/&gt; It would change names again in 1955, this time to 100th Division (Replacement Training).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;/&gt; It would once again be reorganized in 1959 to its present designation as 100th Division (Institutional Training). Its mission became to teach basic, advanced, and common training skills to soldiers from the Army's active, reserve, and [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] components.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;/&gt;

In 1961, some 1,500 soldiers from the 100th were activated and sent to [[Fort Chaffee]], [[Arkansas]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lineage&quot;/&gt; in order to provide support during the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]]. During their time on active duty, the 100th successfully trained some 32,000 soldiers after thoroughly rebuilding and fixing the old Army base. The unit was returned to reserve status again in August 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt; In 1968, the division received its [[distinctive unit insignia]], which alluded to its history in World War II and as a Kentucky-based unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIOH&quot;/&gt;

With the [[Reorganization Objective Army Division]] plan in 1968, the division ceased to be centered on regiments and instead was reorganized with brigades. However, with the 199th Infantry Brigade active as a separate brigade, the division's new brigades were activated from units that had been under its command in World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath224&quot;&gt;McGrath, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The division's headquarters element (which had since been replaced by a [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company]]) was redesignated the [[1st Brigade, 100th Division (United States)|1st Brigade, 100th Division]] responsible for basic armor school training.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath224&quot;/&gt; The 928th Field Artillery Battalion became the [[2nd Brigade, 100th Division (United States)|2nd Brigade, 100th Division]] responsible for armored cavalry unit training.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath224&quot;/&gt; The 325th Engineer Battalion became the [[3rd Brigade, 100th Division (United States)|3rd Brigade, 100th Division]] responsible for combat support training,&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath224&quot;/&gt; and the 800th Ordnance Battalion became the [[4th Brigade, 100th Division (United States)|4th Brigade, 100th Division]], responsible for combat service support training.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath225&quot;&gt;McGrath, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the 100th became the first Army Reserve formation to be equipped with its own squadrons of [[M1 Abrams]] [[tank]]s. With the arrival of the [[M3 Bradley]] [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s, the division's mission profile changed from individual combat training to armor and armor reconnaissance training.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt; By 1986, it was the largest reserve unit within the state of [[Kentucky]], commanding fifty-eight percent of instate reservists.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt;

===Gulf War and beyond===
At the outbreak of [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991, the 100th was assigned to armor training at [[Fort Knox]], Kentucky for deploying armor units. Armor training was a responsibility that the division continued after the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt;

In 1995 the division was reorganized to include Army Reserve schools, taking over the responsibilities for new programs. In 1996 the 100th Division's 1st Brigade worked with Readiness Group Knox to pioneer the national training experiment to reserve combat units at crew and platoon levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt; Later that year, the division added three additional divisional brigades; the [[5th Brigade, 100th Division (United States)|5th Brigade, 100th Division]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] for health services training,&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath225&quot;/&gt; the [[6th Brigade, 100th Division (United States)|6th Brigade, 100th Division]] in Louisville, Kentucky for professional development training,&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath225&quot;/&gt; and the [[7th Brigade, 100th Division (United States)|7th Brigade, 100th Division]] at Fort Knox, formed from the 100th Training Command and responsible for training exercises.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath225&quot;/&gt; The 5th Brigade moved to [[Millington, Tennessee]] in 1997, and the 7th Brigade deactivated in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath225&quot;/&gt; The [[8th Brigade, 100th Division (United States)|8th Brigade, 100th Division]] was also activated as a unit overseeing ROTC training.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIOH&quot;/&gt;

During 1997, the division was tasked with partial responsibility for [[Operation Future Challenge]] at Fort Knox, a six-week [[Reserve Officer's Training Corps]] Basic Camp during each summer. By 2000, the 100th has assumed full responsibility for running the camp. Later that same year, the 100th began deactivating many of its [[M1A1 Abrams]] tanks as part of a reduction in military expenditures.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]], the 100th Division began taking on the job of preparing [[Army National Guard]] units from [[Ohio]] and Kentucky as they began to prepare for deployment in support of the [[War on Terrorism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt;

By 2006, the division had moved its headquarters from [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] to Fort Knox, easing distance strains in administration and training.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO&quot;/&gt; In line with Army Reserve transformations, the 100th Division restructured, eliminating all but four of its brigades. The division shifted its focus from initial entry training to providing [[military occupational specialty]] and [[non-commissioned officer]] training for four army career fields across the United States. The new 100th Division (Operational Support) teaches soldiers subjects from [[military intelligence]], [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|signal corps]], [[civil affairs]]/psychological operations and health services.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usar.army.mil/arweb/organization/commandstructure/USARC/TNG/80Tng/Commands/100div/Pages/default.aspx |title=US Army Reserve: 100th Division |publisher=US Army Reserve |accessdate=9 June 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hSN0Ssrb?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usar.army.mil%2Farweb%2Forganization%2Fcommandstructure%2FUSARC%2FTNG%2F80Tng%2FCommands%2F100div%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx |archivedate=11 June 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
