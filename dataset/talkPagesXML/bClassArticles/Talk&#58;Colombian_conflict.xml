== Questionable, extraordinary claim ==

The following text in the History section is a very substantial claim (in bold), which I have removed (especially because this article is currently linked from In The News on the main page) for lack of reliable sources per [[WP:EXCEPTIONAL]] (surprising or apparently important claims not covered by multiple mainstream sources):

{{quote|On May 16, 1961 President John F. Kennedy announced the second project of the Peace Corps (an initiative of the Government of the United States to contain communism) would be held in Colombia. Sixty-four volunteers would be in charge of assisting rural communities in agricultural development, construction, education and health projects.&lt;br&gt;
'''Instead of supporting diversified rural development, American volunteers in Colombia ended up supporting the production of narcotics, collaborating with the American Mafia and Colombian traffickers.'''}}

A Google Translate translation of the source, gives the following support for the claim:
{{quote|On May 16, 1961 President John f. Kennedy announced that the second project of the Peace Corps (an initiative of the government of the United States to contain communism in underdeveloped countries) would take place in Colombia. 64 volunteers would be in charge of assisting rural communities in agricultural development projects, construction, education and health. &quot;Today, I am pleased to announce the second project of the Peace Corps. This Time in Colombia (...) I am Particularly pleased to announce That the second project of the Corps will be in Latin America, Because of the many ties of mutual Which ideals and mutual respect bind us together as brother republics in traditionally free and democratic esta hemisphere. &quot;&lt;br&gt;
Paradoxically, part of the intension of rural development in the Peace Corps in Colombia marimbera boom ended in a short cycle agrarian economy that opened the doors to the market of cocaine and heroin in Colombia. American volunteers discovered the qualities of marijuana in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and became traffickers under a business that would later be handled by the US Mafia collaboration with Colombian coastal traffickers.&lt;br&gt;
In Magdalena, Cesar and Guajira gringa mafia modernized crops and marijuana business. He began handing out dollars between the upper echelons of the Colombian authorities. Subsequently introduced fully equipped American personnel who interacted with the Colombian marimba players who were responsible for cultivating, caring and sell marijuana to the gringos, who later brought forth the country in planes and boats to the United States.}}

The article provides no citations for the origins of their claim and the website (in English &quot;Open Truth&quot;) seems of questionable reliability. I searched 10 pages of Google results for ''mafia Peace Corps Colombia'' and ''mafia &quot;Peace Corps&quot; Colombia'' (quotation marks keep the phrase together, rather than searching for individual words).

The only sources that fully support the claims seem to be student reports and not reliable sources (in my opinion, they may have been taken from this Wikipedia article). [https://www.theodysseyonline.com/colombia-52-years-civil-war This article], in what appears to be a university student news website, says: 
{{quote| What began as a containment method for Communism during the Cold War era would evolve into something else. Whenever President Kennedy sent the Peace Corps to Colombia for education in healthcare, agriculture or construction. It transitioned from a really good idea into something dreadful.&lt;br&gt;
Overtime the volunteers turned into narcotics instructors for the American Mafia and the Colombian drug traffickers. The most prominent drug produced was cocaine, and the buyers varied from the U.S. and the E.U. So what began as a means of containing communism in America’s Backyard, evolved into the War on Drugs.}}
In another apparent student report, [https://prezi.com/avugneimexmu/kidnappings-cocaine-and-courageous-people/ this presentation] says:
{{quote|1961 - Kennedy's peace corps project meant to help Colombia&lt;br&gt;
Reality: Introduced drug and the drug trade to Colombia by the mafia under this false pretense}}

The only reliable source I could find ''discussing'' (not supporting) the claim is [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-11-12/news/0411130020_1_peace-corps-colombian-cocaine-kingpin this Chicago Tribune article] about Colombians' reactions to the 2004 movie El Rey which presumably (based on the article) connects the Peace Corps with starting the drug trade in Colombia:
{{quote|Although it may seem preposterous to many in the U.S., it's a commonly held belief here that Peace Corps volunteers first taught Colombians how to process coca leaves into cocaine. U.S. officials and Peace Corps veterans have long denied the allegation, but some Colombian historians and journalists have kept it alive for years.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;El Rey's&quot; director and screenwriter, Antonio Dorado, is careful to categorize his film--in which he also attacks corrupt police, unscrupulous politicians and half-hearted revolutionaries--as fiction. But he says he has ample anecdotal and documentary evidence that some Peace Corps volunteers participated in the beginnings of what has become a devastating social, military and economic problem for the U.S. and Colombia.&lt;br&gt;
Ricardo Vargas, a Colombian who has written several books on drug trafficking, said he finds it hard to believe the Americans could teach Colombians anything about coca.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I've heard that rumor about the Peace Corps, but I never paid much attention to it,&quot; he said.}}

Other seemingly reliable sources do not support the claim that &quot;American volunteers in Colombia ended up supporting the production of narcotics, collaborating with the American Mafia and Colombian traffickers.&quot;
