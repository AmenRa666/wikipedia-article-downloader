==Article upgrade== 
I'm making an intermittent effort to get the article up to, hopefully, FA status. The French Article is already at that point, so I'm liberally stealing ideas from them, with my limited Francophone abilities. The French article lifted several images from the National Park Service websites. I confirmed by email today that all images there, unless otherwise noted, are public domain, so if anyone has any suggestions for prettying-up the article, we have resources.

The two who were killed, were killed after the surrender and are not considered part of the battle casualties.

::::Hostile? Bad faith?..er, no. Where does that come from? But I do see the problem..you are here to make an argument about no deaths during the battle...I haven't seen anyone arguing with you about that. You incorrectly labeled this section with a devout declaration that there were no casualties. Realizing that you didn't know what the word meant, I made a comment to help you out as well as any other reader who might be following along. But you persisted with this by declaring &quot;The actual number of killed or wounded on the Union side ''during the battle'' were zero.&quot; Since the infobox has some wounded and the source has wounded listed that is clearly wrong. You omitted the preceding sentence which was kinda important and hard to miss. I think we are Apples/Oranges here..with my point being that there were '''wounded''' declared and that is what the sources say. Clearly, I'm not upset or I wouldn't have made the horse joke.&lt;br&gt;[[User:Berean Hunter|&lt;font face=&quot;High Tower Text&quot; size=&quot;3px&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;⋙–Ber&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#66f&quot;&gt;ean–Hun&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;ter—►&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:Berean Hunter|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;(⊕)&lt;/b&gt;]]) 03:02, 13 November 2008 (UTC)

::I understand that the term &quot;causualty&quot; can include either wounded or dead, but the fact that there were no deaths at all during the battle should be made clear in the infobox.  When I started to read it I immediately thought &quot;11 dead, and 2 more killed after the battle.&quot;  The simple inclusion of &quot;wounded&quot; after the number would clear that up, erase the impression of contradiction with the parts of the article describing no deaths and give a better sense of the event. [[User:Askahrc|The Cap&amp;#39;n]] ([[User talk:Askahrc|talk]]) 17:12, 12 April 2011 (UTC)

== Contradictions ==

Assertions in this article contradict the [[Fort Sumter]] article - particularly regarding casualties. There are also less details in this article about the events just before the battle than there are in the fort article --[[User:JimWae|JimWae]] ([[User talk:JimWae|talk]]) 07:31, 8 December 2008 (UTC)

== Intro ==

The intro to this article is terrible. Who started the fight? Who won it? I don't have any time to work on this right now. [[User:Bsimmons666|'''Bsimmons&lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;666&lt;/font&gt;''']] ([[User_talk:Bsimmons666|talk]]) 02:32, 11 March 2009 (UTC)
'''Bold text'''

== Effect on the fort building ==

Judging by the photo, the fort appears to have been utterly destroyed.  Can anyone confirm this, and perhaps add a sentence to that effect in the article?  --[[User:Doradus|Doradus]] ([[User talk:Doradus|talk]]) 14:37, 12 April 2010 (UTC)

:Which photo are you referring to? No, it wasn't destroyed in this battle. Later in 1863, it will be damaged far more in the [[Second Battle of Fort Sumter]].&lt;br&gt;[[User:Berean Hunter|&lt;font face=&quot;High Tower Text&quot; size=&quot;2px&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;⋙–Ber&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#66f&quot;&gt;ean–Hun&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;ter—►&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:Berean Hunter|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;(⊕)&lt;/b&gt;]]) 14:53, 12 April 2010 (UTC)

:''&quot;The barracks, officers' quarters and other wooden buildings were destroyed, but the walls of the fort suffered little damage, evidence that Anderson might have held longer had it not been for the wood, and presaging the later struggle of its Confederate defenders against month after month of Federal bombardment.&quot;''

==Operation Brothers at War==
Hello, folks. Some of you may have read about the special project underway called [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Operation Brothers at War|Operation Brothers at War]].  It is under the umbrella of WikiProject Military History and represents an effort to get articles on major battles (and leaders) of the Civil War up to FA class in time for their 150th anniversary.  Naturally, it would be ideal to kick off the project with this article on the main page on April 12, 2011.  The time approaches.  I think this article looks very good (my congratulations to the editors who have worked on it over the years) and I think it's nearly ready.  I'd be willing to usher it through a peer review by WikiProject Military History and the FA review and work on necessary changes. I thought I'd start by posting here and seeing if any of the past editors might want to do that...don't want to step on any toes.  Regards, [[User:Historical Perspective|Historical Perspective]] ([[User talk:Historical Perspective|talk]]) 12:54, 19 January 2011 (UTC)

== Images ==

Was going to say this ont he F, but... didn't get there in time. You could do FAR better than the images in this article. Take the lead image. You could use that tiny, bad scan, but if you know where to look, it's easy to find images like this: http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/ppmsca.19520/ - that TIFF should be at least 1000px wide, probably more, and the colour fidelity is much better. 

[http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=Fort+sumter&amp;sp=3&amp;st=gallery The  Library of Congress has 192 images related to Fort Sumter]. While not all will be useful, I suspect you could make a much better-illustrated article. For example, [http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/ppmsca.22982/ this] would be a wonderful inclusion, or you could use [http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2008679543/resource/ this] to set the scene. There's also various images of the interior, some during the battle.

Oh, in case you don't know: always download the TIFF, then convert to JPEG or PNG for upload (preferably both: JPEG is lossy, but PNG is lossless and thus can be edited easily, for example, to get you a featured picture to go with your article - but large PNGs can fail to display because five years later, noone at mediawiki can be arsed to put in the new PNG code that's been made for dealing with large PNGs... I'm ranting.). Anyway! The JPEGs that the LoC offer are always much smaller than the full-resolution TIFFs, so use the TIFF. &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 04:44, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

:I would prefer to use PNG but I know I ran across where they tell you to convert to JPG...can't remember where at the moment ([[Commons:First_steps/Quality_and_description|here it is]]). As long as the image doesn't go over 3500 pixels on a side, it should be okay. I do download the TIFF and then do any cropping, rescaling, rotating, etc. while it is in that format before converting. I'm using [[GIMP]] and occasionally [[ImageMagick]]. Gimp converts the largest 16 channel TIFFs to 8 channel.

:Many of the photos should not be uploaded as presented by LOC. They need to be cropped and possibly refinished. Compare [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/cwpb/07500/07587v.jpg this] vs. [[:File:ColonelJohnSMosbyPortrait.jpg|my rendering]]. That took a while to do.

:Most of the images for Fort Sumter are after the damages of 1863. Many of the plates are broken and scratched. Some aren't very pertinent. I love [http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/det1994024625/PP/ this one]...look at the small gray phantom just above the little girl's head...that is Fort Sumter. That said, I don't mind getting whatever the editors here want for the article. Unless it exceeds 3500px dimension, they will probably be PNG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#294 0.1em 0.1em 0.3em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:Berean Hunter|&lt;font face=&quot;High Tower Text&quot; size=&quot;2px&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;⋙–Ber&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#66f&quot;&gt;ean–Hun&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;ter—►&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:Berean Hunter|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;(⊕)&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 12:57, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

::Visiting your suggested images. The image in the infobox is in the same [http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/90711987/ set of images] (3rd thumbnail down) as the first you suggest (1st thumbnail)...I don't see your point about better color resolution with the first over the third. Perhaps the third could be uploaded in higher res. The second image you suggest shouldn't be used in this article at all but perhaps in the [[Second Battle of Fort Sumter]] article...notice that ''Confederate flag'' flying over the fort, this is a depiction from the 1863 siege. The third image you suggest is from 1901 and is accurate to that time...the fort didn't look like this at all in 1861. The top two levels have been demolished and most of the embrasures are sealed off. That lighthouse &amp; house didn't exist during the Civil War...it is a very nice print, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#294 0.1em 0.1em 0.3em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:Berean Hunter|&lt;font face=&quot;High Tower Text&quot; size=&quot;2px&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;⋙–Ber&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#66f&quot;&gt;ean–Hun&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;ter—►&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:Berean Hunter|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#00C&quot;&gt;(⊕)&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 14:29, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

== Legal Issue ==

I think SOME of the following paragraph IS relevant to the article, since the battle took place because the CSA claimed the land had become theirs (and some claim SC never ceded title to the land)--[[User:JimWae|JimWae]] ([[User talk:JimWae|talk]]) 21:39, 14 April 2011 (UTC)
:Fort Sumter, by contrast, was built on a shoal in the middle of the entrance to the harbor. Interestingly, during construction, one Major William Laval claimed that he owned the land on which the new fort was being built—even though the &quot;land&quot; was under water—and construction stopped. Anxious to have the fort built, the South Carolina legislature ceded &quot;to the United States, all the right, title and claim of South Carolina to the site of Fort Sumter and the requisite quantity of adjacent territory&quot; in 1836, reserving only the right to serve and execute legal process. As a result, Fort Sumter did not belong to South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Huddleston, [http://www.civilwarhome.com/sumterownership.htm Ownership of Fort Sumter], published 2005.01.13, accessed 2011.04.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

:: Perhaps so, but it needs a more thoughtful presentation and set of references than the text I deleted. The book length references about Fort Sumter that are currently in the article do not mention this as an issue. The citation was to a Civil War website article signed by an unknown author, which does not conform to the kinds of references we usually use for these articles. One of the NPS websites in the references list mentions Laval's suit and the construction delays, but renders no judgment about whether the legal title was still valid. This, of course, is more of a diplomatic matter than a legal one. [[User:Hlj|Hal Jespersen]] ([[User talk:Hlj|talk]]) 15:47, 15 April 2011 (UTC)

==The day BEFORE Sumpter Was Shelled==
The day before Sumpter was shelled, the Charleston tax collector (I’ve forgotten his name) was threatened with tar and feathering (for all the funniness of the term, it was a very serious death threat at the time). He attempted to flee to Sumpter, and his pursuers followed him out into the harbor; The fort fired “warning shots” (I do not know what the nature of the shots were, only that they have been referred to as “warning shots”). The pursuers broke off, only to return the next day to finish the “discussion.”&lt;br /&gt;
The article should include this event.[[User:Andering J. REDDSON|Trying To Make Wikipedia At Least Better Than The &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Weekly World News.&amp;#39;&amp;#39;]] ([[User talk:Andering J. REDDSON|talk]]) 21:26, 30 September 2011 (UTC)

==There is No Mention of the Breach of the Constitution by The Federal Force Refusing to Leave ==

Read the VIRGINIA RATIFYING CONVENTION 6-16-1788 http://www.pacificwestcom.com/americanpatriotpartynewsletter 

Mr. GREYSTON: &quot;...It was often in contemplation of Congress to have power of regulating the police of the seat of government; but they &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;NEVER&quot; had an idea of exclusive  legislation in all cases. The power  of regulating the police and good government of &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;it&quot; (APP: THE &quot;PLACE&quot; i.e the 10 miles square of Washington DC) will secure Congress  against insults. &quot;What originated the IDEA&quot; of the &quot;exclusive legislation&quot;  was, some insurrection in Pennsylvania, whereby Congress was insulted, on  account of which, it is supposed, they left the state. 

It is answered that  the CONSENT of the STATE MUST be &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, or else they CANNOT have such a district, &quot;OR&quot; places for the erecting of FORTS...&quot;

Note: the Civil War was begun by the federal government exceeding this limitation of federal power in attempting to refuse a state's Constitutional Right of &quot;power of consent&quot; to allow or disallow federal forces to keep or occupy a fort within their state - FORT SUMTER

Mr. PENDLETON. &quot;Mr. Chairman, this clause does &quot;NOT&quot; give Congress  power to impede the operation of &quot;ANY PART&quot; of the Constitution, (N)or to make &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;ANY&quot;  &quot;REGULATION&quot; that may affect the interests of the citizens of the Union &gt;&gt;&gt;AT LARGE. But it gives them power over the &quot;local&quot; &quot;police of THE &gt;&gt;&gt;PLACE&quot; (APP: THE &quot;PLACE&quot; i.e the 10 miles square of Washington DC), so as to be secured from any interruption in their proceedings. Notwithstanding the violent attack  upon it, I believe, sir, this is the &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;fair  construction of the clause&quot;. It gives  them power of exclusive legislation in any case within &gt;&gt;&gt;THAT district.  What is the meaning of this? What is it opposed to? Is it opposed to the general powers of the federal legislature, or to those of the state legislatures?  I understand it as opposed to the legislative power of that state where it shall BE. What, then, is the power? It is, that Congress shall  exclusively legislate there, in order to preserve {440} serve the &quot;police&quot; OF THE &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;PLACE&quot; and their OWN personal independence, that they may not  be overawed or insulted, and of course to preserve them in opposition to any attempt by the state where it shall BE this is the &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;fair construction&quot;.&quot;  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/67.142.172.26|67.142.172.26]] ([[User talk:67.142.172.26|talk]]) 04:40, 22 November 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Casualties ==

The &quot;battle&quot; ended when the terms of &quot;surrender&quot; were agreed upon. Any deaths or injuries that happened after that moment are not part of the official casualty count. The info box is for official counts, not counts before or after the battle, and I don't even see a source for the 4 confederate wounded. Four Union soldiers received &quot;minor&quot; injuries (scratches) when there position was hit. Most would't even consider those casualties. If we include the deaths after the battle, then why not the Confederate deaths before the battle? The deaths that took place preparing the defenses. Its a slippery slope. The info box should only include battle deaths and wounded, and not anything that occurred before or after. The sources that are being used for this, do not confirm all that is being presented.--[[User:Jojhutton|&lt;font color=&quot;#A81933&quot;&gt;JOJ&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Jojhutton|&lt;font color=&quot;#CC9900&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Hutton&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 23:19, 22 May 2012 (UTC)

: That is one point of view, which I would consider acceptable. However, the edit I reversed only went halfway. By citing the NPS website, you can get to zero casualties on both sides, but the edit merely reduced the number of casualties in a way that could not be justified. Minor injuries or scratches are not supposed to be included in casualty lists. The notion of a casualty is something that makes a soldier unavailable for battle--death, serious wounds, or capture. The alternative point of view is that this battle had special significance for the war in that it was the very first, and therefore the issue of who were the first men injured or killed during the war comes up. As far as I know, every secondary source on this battle says some variant of &quot;no casualties, BUT ...&quot; and that is what infobox is trying to portray here. I could go either way, but the result needs to be consistent. [[User:Hlj|Hal Jespersen]] ([[User talk:Hlj|talk]]) 16:36, 24 May 2012 (UTC)
::Wikipedia policy is however clear. [[WP:V|Verifiability, and not truth, is one of the fundamental requirements for inclusion in Wikipedia]], otherwise we are bordering on [[WP:OR|original research]]. If sources say that there were zero casualties, then that's what the article should say. The four Union casualties are from the artillery hit, but all those injuries were minor and are included in the Detzer book, although not exactly in the page number cited. In fact neither of the two cited references for the &quot;casualties&quot; even hints at any Confederate casualties, but they are given as citations to say that there were four wounded. Those citations clearly do not back up the claim of four Confederate casualties. As far as the Union casualties are concerned, yes the info box does make a distinction that the deaths occurred &quot;after&quot; the battle, but no like distinction among the wounded. It says &quot;9 wounded&quot; without making a distinction among how many were wounded before or after the battle. Infoboxes should always be a concise as possible and should not be used as a repository for as much information as we can cram into them. The &quot;surrender&quot; deaths are covered in the body of the article, and that should be sufficient for the needs of the article and its info box.--[[User:Jojhutton|&lt;font color=&quot;#A81933&quot;&gt;JOJ&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Jojhutton|&lt;font color=&quot;#CC9900&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Hutton&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 22:17, 24 May 2012 (UTC)

: As I said, I consider that point of view (zero casualties, cited to the NPS) acceptable.

== Who started it? ==

It is stated in the article that: (Col. Chesnut considered this reply to be too conditional and wrote a reply, which he handed to Anderson at 3:20 a.m) about Anderson's reply. Does it means that he alone decided to reply to Anderson without the approval of Beauregard? 

Because I kinda find that strange. I mean, there was also this in the article: (At 1 a.m. on April 12, the aides brought Anderson a message from Beauregard: &quot;If you will state the time which you will evacuate Fort Sumter, and agree in the meantime that you will not use your guns against us unless ours shall be employed against Fort Sumter, we will abstain from opening fire upon you.&quot; After consulting with his senior officers, Maj. Anderson replied that he would evacuate Sumter by noon, April 15, unless he received new orders from his government or additional supplies.)

To me it seems that Col. Chesnut decided to attack on his own by making it seem that Beauregard was giving the order.

Please, anybody can clarify? Thank you.[[Special:Contributions/99.199.237.60|99.199.237.60]] ([[User talk:99.199.237.60|talk]]) 06:41, 31 January 2013 (UTC)

== Events Leading Up to the War -- additions?  ==

I've just finished watching the PBS documentary ''The Abolitionists'', which functions as a prelude to the war and catalogs the major events and figures that ultimately brought the country to the brink. While ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' is listed under the heading &quot;Events leading to the American Civil War,&quot; ''The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass'' is not. Neither is ''American Slavery As It Is'', which, according to its Wiki page, is after ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', &quot;the second most influential piece of anti-slavery literature of the time period&quot; and was Beecher Stowe's primary source. I think the primary editors of this page should consider including these two other seminal works of Abolitionism, a movement without which it is unlikely the country would've been moved to war. The film pays particular attention to these works and those who wrote them and presents a narrative wherein they played a major part. Perhaps it's too general, but it may also be pertinent to list the Abolitionist movement itself as a precursor to war, which it certainly was.

== Dates of Lincoln's electoral victory and inauguration ==

I added the dates of Lincoln's inauguration (March 4, 1861) and electoral victory (November 6, 1860). This is because we have just heard of President Buchanan's attempt to resupply Fort Sumter in early January. The date is still before modern [[Inauguration Day]], but I think it may be worthwhile to remind readers of when Lincoln won the election and when he took the oath of office. If others disagree, of course, the dates can be removed. [[User:Roches|Roches]] ([[User talk:Roches|talk]]) 02:31, 29 December 2015 (UTC)
