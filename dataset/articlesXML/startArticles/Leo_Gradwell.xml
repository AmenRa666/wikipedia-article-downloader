'''Leo Gradwell''' [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] was a British [[barrister]], a [[magistrate]] and a [[Second World War]] [[Royal Navy]] volunteer, who in July 1942 against orders, led his own RN-adapted trawler HMS ''Ayrshire'' and three merchant ships from the disaster of [[Convoy PQ 17]] into [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=ObitCathHer/&gt;

==Early life==
Born '''Leo Joseph Anthony Gradwell''' in [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], [[England]], Gradwell was educated at [[Stonyhurst College]], [[Lancashire]] and then read classics at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=ObitCathHer/&gt; By the time he graduated, he spoke six languages, and joined the Royal Navy as a [[midshipman]], serving in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=ObitCathHer/&gt;

==Barrister==
At the cessation of hostilities, Gradwell was discharged from the Navy and started a [[pupillage]] in [[Liverpool]] and was [[called to the bar]] in 1925. He entered chambers in Liverpool, then practised as an advocate on the [[Northern Circuit]].&lt;ref name=ObitCathHer/&gt; During his spare time, he enjoyed sailing in the [[Irish Sea]]&lt;ref name=CBRNP/&gt; and gained a coastal navigation certificate.

==Second World War==
At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Gradwell was commissioned into the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] as a [[Lieutenant (Royal Navy)|lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=CBRNP/&gt; He was given command of the [[anti-submarine warfare]] adapted {{convert|575|long ton}} [[Middlesbrough]]-built [[Naval trawler|trawler]] MS ''Ayrshire'', renamed HMS ''Ayrshire'' (FY 225),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulltrawler.net/Sidewinder/Vessel%20-%20A/AYRSHIRE%20H113.htm|title=AYRSHIRE H113|publisher=Hull Trawler|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a crew of volunteer fishermen.

Attached as part of the defensive net around [[Convoy PQ17]], on receiving the third order to scatter on 4 July 1942, Gradwell concluded that as he was heading north to the Arctic ice shelf, he might as well take some merchant ships with him. Leading his convoy of ''Ayrshire'' and three merchant vessels – the [[Panama]]nian-registered ''Troubador'', the ''Ironclad'', and the [[United States|American]]-registered ''Silver Sword''&lt;ref name=UWW7&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Woodman|title=Arctic Convoys 1941–1945|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; – he proceeded north using only a [[sextant]] and the ''Times World Geographic Pocket Book'', as his vessel lacked charts for this part of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. On reaching the Arctic ice pack, the convoy found itself stuck fast, so the ships stopped engines and banked their fires.&lt;ref name=UWW7/&gt; Gradwell arranged a defence, formulated around the fact that the ''Troubador'' was carrying a cargo of bunkering coal and drums of white paint: the crews painted all the vessels white, covered decks with white linen, and arranged the [[Sherman tank]]s on the merchant vessels decks into a defensive ring, with loaded main guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/arts/television/9096362/jeremy-clarkson-brings-yuletide-joy-to-the-delingpole-household/|title=Jeremy Clarkson brings Yuletide joy to the Delingpole household|author=James Delingpole|publisher=[[The Spectator]]|date=14 December 2013|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of waiting, and having evaded the reconnoitring [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft, finding themselves unstuck they proceeded to the [[Matochkin Strait]] in [[Novaya Zemlya]].&lt;ref name=CBRNP/&gt; They were found there by a flotilla of [[corvette]]s&lt;ref name=CBRNP/&gt; that escorted the four-ship convoy, plus two other merchant vessels, to the Russian port of Archangel, arriving on 25 July.&lt;ref name=ObitCathHer/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBRNP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrnp.com/RNP/Flower/ARTICLES/Poppy/Beardmore-1.htm|title=The PQ17 Story – The Worst Journey in the World|author=John Beardmore|publisher=CBRNP.com|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] on 15 September 1942, he later went on to command the ASW adapted [[whaler]] HMS ''Thirlmere'' (FY 206).&lt;ref name=uBoat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/commanders/6990.html|title=Leo Joseph Anthony Gradwell DSC, RNVR|publisher=uboat.net|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==London magistrate==
After the end of hostilities, Gradwell returned to his career in court. He was made a [[stipendiary magistrate]] on the London circuit at [[Great Marlborough Street|Marlborough Street]] [[magistrates' court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]] in 1951, where he shared an office in a tempestuous relationship with Edward Robey, the son of comedian [[George Robey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gangland Soho|author=James Morton}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, he contracted [[polio]]; after successful treatment, he overcame his disabilities and returned to his position as magistrate.&lt;ref name=ObitCathHer/&gt; Dealing mainly with [[licensing]] cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=British Theatre Since the War|author=Dominic Shellard}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his career Gradwell processed the case of [[Stephen Ward]] during the [[Profumo affair]],&lt;ref name=ObitCathHer/&gt; committing Ward for trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in July 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://century.theguardian.com/1960-1969/Story/0,6051,105601,00.html|title=Miss Keeler in court|author=Philip Rawstorne|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 May 1963|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the British publishing rights to [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]]'s novel ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]''' were acquired by [[Marion Boyars]] and [[John Calder]] in January 1966, Gradwell was the judge for the [[private prosecution]] brought by Sir [[Cyril Black]], the then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Member of Parliament for [[Wimbledon (UK Parliament constituency)|Wimbledon]]. The public [[prosecutor]] brought an action under Section 3 of the [[Obscene Publications Act]], which Gradwell agreed with, and Gradwell ordered that all copies of the book be destroyed, though that applied only to seized copies within the Magistrate's Court.&lt;ref&gt;Forell, Claude. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19670325&amp;id=wwgRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XJMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3538,4410128 &quot;A Noble Crusader for Purity.&quot;] [http://about.theage.com.au/about.asp ''The Age Literary Review,''] 25 March 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Expert witnesses spoke, &quot;unprecedentedly,&quot;&lt;ref name=newburn&gt;[[Tim Newburn|Newburn, Tim]] (1992). ''Permission and Regulation: Law and Morals in Post-War Britain.'' London: Routledge, pp. 96–8. [https://books.google.com/books Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; for the prosecution, including the publishers Sir [[Basil Blackwell]] and [[Robert Maxwell]].&lt;ref name=newburn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Montgomery Hyde, Last Exit To Brooklyn'', ''[[The Times]]'', 6 December 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The order was overturned by a successful appeal issued by the lawyer and writer [[John Mortimer]]: [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Mr Justice Lane]] reversed the ruling in 1968.

==Death==
Retiring in 1967, Gradwell died at home in November 1969, aged 70, with his family at his bedside.&lt;ref name=ObitCathHer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/14th-november-1969/10/obituary|title=Obituary – Leo Gradwell|publisher=[[Catholic Herald]]|date=14 November 1969|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
