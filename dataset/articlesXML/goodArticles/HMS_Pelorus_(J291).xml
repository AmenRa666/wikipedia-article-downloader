'''HMS ''Pelorus''''' ([[pennant number]]: J291) was an {{sclass-|Algerine|minesweeper}} built for the Royal Navy (RN) during [[World War II]]. Upon completion, the ship became the [[flotilla leader]] of the 7th Minesweeper Flotilla, clearing mines off the east coast of England. In June 1944, the flotilla was assigned to sweep one of the beaches during the [[Normandy landings]] until she struck a [[naval mine|mine]] the following month. After her repairs were completed, ''Pelorus'' was reassigned to the [[English Channel]] and the 6th Minesweeping Flotilla. The flotilla was transferred to the [[Indian Ocean]] in 1945 and spent some time escorting convoys. They participated in [[Operation Collie]], a bombardment of Japanese positions in the [[Nicobar Islands]], in July and then swept the [[Strait of Malacca]] and the approaches to [[Singapore]] in August.
 
After the war, she was sold to the [[South African Navy]] and renamed ''Pietermaritzburg''. The ship was later converted into a [[midshipman]]s' [[training ship]] during the early 1960s. She served as a [[barracks ship]] from 1968 to 1991 when ''Pietermaritzburg'' was listed for disposal. The ship was [[scuttling|scuttled]] as an [[artificial reef]] off the [[South African]] coast in 1994.

== Description ==
''Pelorus'' displaced {{convert|1030|LT|t|0}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard load]] and {{convert|1325|LT|t|0}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|225|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|35|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a deep [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|3|in|m|1}}. She was powered by a pair of [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by two [[Admiralty three-drum boiler]]s. The engines developed a total of {{convert|2400|ihp|lk=in}} which gave a maximum speed of {{convert|16.5|kn|lk=in}}. The ship carried enough [[fuel oil]] that she had a range of {{convert|5000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. The ship was armed with a single [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|4-inch (102&amp;nbsp;mm) Mk V]] [[dual-purpose gun]]&lt;ref name=l1/&gt; and four single mounts for [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon {{convert|20|mm|1|abbr=on}}]] light [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]].&lt;ref name=d2&gt;du Toit, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; For [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine work]], ''Pelorus'' was fitted with two [[depth charge]] rails, and four depth charge throwers. The ship was equipped with a [[Type 271 radar|Type 271]] surface-search [[radar]] and a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 291|Type 291]] air-search radar. Her crew numbered 85 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=l1&gt;Lenton, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war the two single Oerlikon mounts on the [[bridge wing]]s were replaced by twin power-driven mounts and the two remaining single mounts aft were superseded by two single [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{convert|40|mm|1|abbr=on}} Bofors]] AA guns before the ship sailed for the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name=d2/&gt; In preparation for her reclassification as a training ship, ''Pietermaritzburg'' had her sweeping gear removed and was rearmed with her main armament replaced by a twin-gun turret fitted with more powerful [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|4-inch Mk XVI guns]] in 1961–62. The Bofors guns were moved to the roof of the enlarged aft superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Chumbley &amp; Budzbon, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; Her complement now consisted of 8 officers, 73 ratings, 10 [[midshipmen]] and 50 trainees.&lt;ref name=d4&gt;du Toit, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; She was refitted in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore 280&quot;&gt;Moore, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Pelorus'' was named after [[Pelorus Jack]], a [[Risso's dolphin]] that often escorted ships through [[French Pass]] in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=d3&gt;du Toit, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was ordered on 1 January 1942 from Lobnitz of [[Renfrew, Scotland]] and [[laid down]] on 8 October. She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 18 June 1943 and completed two months later on 7 October.&lt;ref&gt;Lenton, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was assigned to the newly formed 7th Minesweeping Flotilla upon completion and served as the flotilla leader. The flotilla was tasked with clearing mines off the east coast of England until June 1944 when they were assigned to sweep the [[minefield]]s protecting [[Juno Beach]] during the Normandy landings. ''Pelorus'' led the flotilla on 6 June and was thus the leading ship of the entire invasion fleet.&lt;ref name=d3/&gt; While sweeping the approaches to [[Cherbourg]], she struck a mine that damaged the [[port and starboard|port]] engine and propeller. The ship was under repair for three months and was transferred to the 6th Minesweeping Flotilla at [[Plymouth]] when they were completed.&lt;ref name=d3/&gt;

The flotilla sailed for the Far East on 8 April 1945 and was assigned convoy escort duties on arrival. On 2 July, they swept the approaches to the Nicobar Islands during Operation Collie and destroyed 167 mines. As the Pacific War was ending on 15 August, they swept the Strait of Malacca and the approaches to Singapore. Together with the [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Cleopatra|33|2}}, ''Pelorus'' was one of the first British ships to re-enter Singapore harbour. She returned home in May 1946 and was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]].&lt;ref name=d3/&gt;

In 1947 the ship was sold to the South African Navy, together with her [[sister ship]], [[HMSAS Bloemfontein|''Rosamund'']], and departed England on 22 November after a refresher course at the minesweeping school at [[HMS Lochinvar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Lochinvar'']], [[Port Edgar]], Scotland. The sisters arrived at [[Cape Town]] on 24 December, making stops at [[Gibraltar]], [[Freetown]] and [[Walvis Bay]] en route. She was rechristened by the mayor of the city, A. E. Hirst, on 21 January 1948. The navy had originally intended to rename the ship ''Maritzburg'', but decided to use the city's full name after protests. In November of that year, the sisters exercised with the British 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron. Later that month, together with the [[frigate]] {{HMSAS|Natal|K10|2}}, they visited ports in [[Portuguese Mozambique]], returning to [[Durban]] on 12 December. While serving as a midshipmans' training ship, ''Pietermaritzburg'' became the largest South African warship to visit [[Knysna]] in September 1953. The ship and her sister were placed in reserve for a time in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;du Toit, pp. 183–84&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adam on PMB stairs.jpg|thumb|A diver over the wreck]]
''Pietermaritzburg'' re-commissioned as a dedicated training ship on 30 August 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore 280&quot;/&gt; While participating the training exercise ''Capex 63'' with the Royal Navy, the ship accidentally rammed the British frigate {{HMS|Leopard|F14|2}}. Although her [[bow (ship)|bow]] was crushed by the collision, both ships were able to steam back to [[Simon's Town]], South Africa for repairs. The subsequent inquiry found officers from both ships negligent. She was placed back in reserve in July 1964 and became an accommodation ship at Simon's Town for the navy's minesweeping flotilla on 17 June 1968. ''Pietermaritzburg'' was listed for disposal in 1991&lt;ref&gt;du Toit, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; and the navy made the decision to dispose of her as an artificial reef.&lt;ref name=&quot;wre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wreck of the SAS Pietermaritzburg|publisher=SAHRA |url=http://www.sahra.org.za/sahris/about/news/wreck-sas-pietermaritzburg|website=www.sahra.org.za|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pietermaritzburg'' was scuttled on 12 November 1994 to make an artificial reef at [[Miller's Point, Western Cape|Miller's Point]] near Simon's Town. The wreck settled upright on the sand at a maximum depth of {{convert|22|m|ft}}. It has begun to collapse and the interior is much less accessible than it used to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diving the Cape Peninsula and False Bay/SAS Pietermaritzburg|url=http://www.thefullwiki.org/Diving_the_Cape_Peninsula_and_False_Bay/SAS_Pietermaritzburg|website=www.thefullwiki.org|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck and surrounding {{convert|300|m|ft}} was declared a South African National Heritage Site on 23 August 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Heritage Resources Act (25/1999): Declaration as a National Heritage Site|journal=Government Gazette|date=23 August 2013|volume=578|issue=36776|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/sites/default/files/website/articledocs/36776_23-3_ArtsCultureCV01%20SASPietermaritzburg.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; after legal salvage efforts in 2012 had badly damaged the wreck.&lt;ref name=wre/&gt;
