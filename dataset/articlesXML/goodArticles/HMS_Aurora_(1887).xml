'''HMS ''Aurora''''' was one of seven {{sclass-|Orlando|cruiser|0}} [[armoured cruiser]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the mid-1880s. The ship spent a brief time in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] before she was assigned to the [[Channel Squadron]] for two years in 1890. In 1893 ''Aurora'' became a [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|coast guard ship]] in Ireland for two years before she was placed in reserve again. The ship [[Ship commissioning|recommissioned]] in 1899 for service on the [[China Station]] and some of her crew participated in the [[Battle of Tientsin]] in 1900 during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. ''Aurora'' returned home two years later and was again reduced to reserve. She was taken out of service in 1905 and sold for [[Ship breaking|scrap]] on 2 October 1907.

==Design and description==
The ''Orlando''-class cruisers were enlarged versions of the {{sclass-|Mersey|cruiser|4}} with more armour and a more powerful armament. Like their predecessors, they were intended to protect British shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aurora'' had a [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|300|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|56|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|24|ft|m|1}}. Designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|5040|LT|t}}, all of the ''Orlando''-class ships proved to be overweight and displaced approximately {{convert|5535|LT|t}}. The ships were powered by a pair of three-cylinder [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft, which were designed to produce a total of {{convert|8500|ihp|lk=in}} and a maximum speed of {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}} using steam provided by four [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s with [[forced draught]]. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|900|LT|t}} of coal which was designed to give her a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. The ship's complement was 484 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=ck5&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aurora''{{'}}s main armament consisted of two [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading]] (BL) [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk III - VII|{{convert|9.2|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} Mk V guns]], one gun fore and aft of the superstructure on [[pivot gun|pivot mounts]]. Her secondary armament was ten [[BL 6 inch gun Mk III IV VI|BL {{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} guns]], five on each [[broadside]]. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by six [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss|6-pounder Hotchkiss]] guns and ten [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss]] guns, most of which were mounted on the main [[deck (ship)|deck]] in broadside positions. The ship was also armed with six 18-inch (457&amp;nbsp;mm) [[torpedo tube]]s: four on the broadside above water and one each in the bow and stern below water.&lt;ref name=ck5/&gt;

The ship was protected by a [[waterline]] [[compound armour]] [[Belt armor|belt]] {{convert|10|in|0}} thick. It covered the middle {{convert|200|ft|m|1}} of the ship and was {{convert|5|ft|6|in|1}} high.&lt;ref name=ck5/&gt; Because the ship was overweight, the top of the armour belt was {{convert|2|ft}} below the waterline when she was fully loaded.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The ends of the armour belt were closed off by transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s {{convert|16|in|0}}. The lower deck was {{convert|2|-|3|in|0}} thick over the full length of the hull. The [[conning tower]] was protected by {{convert|12|in|0}} of armour.&lt;ref name=ck5/&gt;

==Construction and service==
''Aurora'', named for the [[Aurora (mythology)|eponymous Roman goddess of the dawn]],&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; was the eighth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[Keel|laid down]] on 1 February 1886 by [[Pembroke Dockyard]]. The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 28 October 1887 by Mrs. Sophia Morant, wife of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[George Digby Morant|George Morant]], [[Captain-Superintendent]] of the dockyard&lt;ref name=p4/&gt; and completed in July 1889&lt;ref name=lw9&gt;Winfield &amp; Lyon, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of [[pound sterling|£]]258,390.&lt;ref name=p4&gt;Phillips, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aurora'' went straight into reserve at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] after completion, but was commissioned for service with the Channel Squadron in 1890–92. She was transferred to [[Bantry]], Ireland, in 1893 to serve as the local coastguard ship until 1895. That year the ship was reassigned to the Devonport Reserve and remained there until 1899. ''Aurora'' participated in [[Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee]] [[Fleet review (Commonwealth realms)|Fleet review]] on 26 June 1897 at [[Spithead]].&lt;ref name=p4/&gt;  

''Aurora'' was recommissioned for service in the [[Far East]] in 1899&lt;ref name=ck5/&gt; under the command of Captain Edward Bayly and some of her crew, including Bayly, took part in the Battle of Tientsin in July 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt; In early February 1902 she was ordered to leave, homebound,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |date=1 February 1902 |page_number=13 |issue=36680| }}&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at [[Aden]] on 3 March, at [[Malta]] 17 March, and at [[Plymouth]] on 26 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |date=27 March 1902 |page_number=4 |issue=36726| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers and crew received the [[China War Medal (1900)]] on 15 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Recent Operations in China |day_of_week=Wednesday |date= 16 April 1902 |page_number=7 |issue=36743}}&lt;/ref&gt; before she paid off at Devonport two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Friday |date=18 April 1902 |page_number=9 |issue=36745|}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aurora'' was refitted in [[Clydebank]] upon her return and was placed in Devonport Reserve in 1904 before she was taken out of service the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was sold for scrap to Payton, of [[Milford Haven]], [[Wales]], on 2 October 1907.&lt;ref name=p4/&gt;
