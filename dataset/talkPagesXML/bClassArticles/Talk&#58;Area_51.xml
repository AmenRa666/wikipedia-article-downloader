== Illegal photos ==

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/795 US law] is hardly my &quot;lay opinion&quot;. You ''cannot'' photograph defense installations, or any part thereof without permission from the relevant authorities. --'''[[User:Jakec|Jakob]] ([[user talk:Jakec|talk]]) ''' &lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;aka Jakec&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 01:18, 5 September 2016 (UTC)

:That is the text of the cited law, not an opinion. It's your opinion that these pictures run afoul of it. Cite reliable interpretations of that law that show that displaying these pictures is illegal. You can see these kinds of pictures on a number of American sites (news sites, stock photo collections, etc.), so I'm disinclined to agree with your interpretation. --[[User:Xanzzibar|Xanzzibar]] ([[User talk:Xanzzibar|talk]]) 01:54, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
::Really? Really? Your defense is &quot;Well, '''''I''''' don't think it's illegal! *sticks out tongue*&quot;. I'd rather we simply made an effort to comply with US law instead of finding out the hard way one day. Perhaps the stock photo sites and news sites are also violating the law. I'll use an example with copyright violations, since it's the only form of illegal content that people here can be bothered to care about: when we see a copyright violation, do we just leave it there until someone files a DCMA notice because it's only our &quot;''opinion''&quot; that it's a copyright violation{{mdash}}or do we do the decent thing and take it down? Regardless, I decided last year that I will not participate in any website that flagrantly hosts illegal content. I left Commons for that reason, I would not want to leave Wikipedia for that reason too. --'''[[User:Jakec|Jakob]] ([[user talk:Jakec|talk]]) ''' &lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;aka Jakec&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 02:37, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
:::{{tq|Whenever, in the interests of national defense, the President defines certain vital military and naval installations or equipment as requiring protection against the general dissemination of information relative thereto}} does not sound like &quot;everything&quot; to me. This is a question where Wikilegal's input is necessary, IMO. [[User:Jo-Jo Eumerus|Jo-Jo Eumerus]] ([[User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus|talk]], [[Special:CentralAuth/Jo-Jo Eumerus|contributions]]) 16:24, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
::::There's no valid reason for removing a photograph of a sign saying &quot;photography is prohibited&quot; immediately after the words &quot;beyond this point&quot;. Such images have been broadcast on television programs and exist all over the internet. Although it is illegal to photograph ''some'' US military facilities (&quot;certain vital military and naval installations&quot;) without permission, Wikipedia didn't take this photograph, so our concern should be limited to copyright status, as others have said. - [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 16:37, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::Somebody else breaking the law is not an excuse for us to do it. There are thousands of murderers, but that does not make it okay for me to go out and kill someone. And it certainly does not say &quot;beyond this point&quot;, just that photography is prohibited, period. But whatever, I am done with this illegal website. --'''[[User:Jakec|Jakob]] ([[user talk:Jakec|talk]]) ''' &lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;aka Jakec&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 18:15, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::You have not made a convincing argument that displaying the image is breaking in law. It would be shame if you quit editing Wikipedia because of this.- [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 18:21, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::&lt;small&gt;(Cross posting this from VPP as it is relevant enough to do so.)&lt;/small&gt; The US Government knows that they can't stop people from taking images with a telephoto lens or just outside the perimeter. And they don't try. However, photos from inside the perimeter would be considered classified information and uploading them on here would cause an enormous amount of trouble for Wikimedia as they are based in the US. Seeing as the photo is question was taking outside the perimeter (and therefore outside the classified zone) it shouldn't be a problem. --[[User:Majora|Majora]] ([[User talk:Majora|talk]]) 18:51, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
