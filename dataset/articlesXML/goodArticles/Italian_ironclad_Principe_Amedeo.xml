'''''Principe Amedeo''''' was an [[ironclad warship]] built by the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' in the 1860s and 1870s. She was the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass-|Principe Amedeo|ironclad|4}}, alongside her [[sister ship]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Palestro||2}}. ''Principe Amedeo'' was laid down in 1865, launched in 1872, and completed in late 1874. She was armed with a battery of six {{convert|10|in|abbr=on|0}} guns and one {{convert|11|in|abbr=on|0}} gun. The last sail-rigged ironclad of the Italian fleet, she had a single steam engine that was capable of propelling the ship at a speed of slightly over {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}}.

''Principe Amedeo''{{'}}s lengthy construction time rendered her obsolescent by the time she entered service. As a result, she primarily served as a station ship in Italy's overseas empire. In November 1881, she collided with the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Roma||2}} in a storm in [[Naples]]. ''Principe Amadeo'' was withdrawn from service in 1888 and converted into a [[headquarters ship]] for the vessels defending [[Taranto]]. She was stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1895 and thereafter used as a [[depot ship]] until she was [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap in 1910.

{{main|Principe Amedeo-class ironclad}}

''Principe Amedeo'' was {{convert|79.73|m|sp=us}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]]; she had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.4|m|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7.9|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|5761|MT|sp=us}} normally and up to {{convert|6020|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion [[steam engine]] that drove a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by six coal-fired, cylindrical [[fire-tube boiler]]s. Her engine produced a top speed of {{convert|12.2|kn|lk=in}} at {{convert|6117|ihp|lk=in}}. She could steam for {{convert|1780|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. The ship was [[barque]]-rigged to supplement the steam engine; ''Principe Amedeo'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] were the last rigged ironclads to be built by Italy. She had a crew of 548&amp;nbsp;officers and men.&lt;ref name=G340/&gt;

''Principe Amedeo'' was armed with a [[main battery]] of six {{convert|10|in|abbr=on|0}} guns, mounted in a single armored [[casemate]]s placed [[amidships]], with three guns on each [[broadside]]. A {{convert|11|in|abbr=on|0}} gun was mounted forward as a [[bow chaser]]. ''Principe Amedeo'' was protected by iron [[belt armor]] that was {{convert|8.7|in|abbr=on|0}} thick and extended for the entire length of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The casemates were protected with {{convert|5.5|in|abbr=on|0}} of iron plating, and the small [[conning tower]] had {{convert|2.4|in|abbr=on|0}} thick iron plates.&lt;ref name=G340/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Italia battleship 1880 01.jpg|thumb|left|''Principe Amedeo'' (right background) at the launch for the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Italia||2}} in 1880. The other ships present are the Italian {{ship|Italian ironclad|Regina Maria Pia||2}} (in front of ''Principe Amedeo'') and the British {{HMS|Monarch|1868|6}} and {{HMS|Thunderer|1872|2}}.]]
''Principe Amedeo'' was laid down at the [[Arsenale di La Spezia]] in August 1865, and her completed hull was launched on 15 January 1872. [[Fitting-out]] work proceeded very slowly, and the ship was finally completed on 15 December 1874.&lt;ref name=G340&gt;Gardiner, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; Obsolescent by the time she was completed, ''Principe Amedeo'' primarily served in the [[Italian colonial empire]],&lt;ref name=O358&gt;Ordovini et al., p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; which Italy had begun acquiring in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; She occasionally took part in training maneuvers with the main Italian fleet throughout her career.&lt;ref name=O358/&gt;

''Principe Amedeo'' took part in the launching ceremony for the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Italia||2}} on 29 September 1880; also present were the Italian ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Regina Maria Pia||2}} and King [[Umberto I]] aboard his [[yacht]], and the British ironclads {{HMS|Monarch|1868|6}} and {{HMS|Thunderer|1872|2}} with Vice Admiral [[George Tryon]], both members of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]]. At the time, ''Principe Amedeo'' flew the flag of [[Vice Admiral]] Martini.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; In early November 1881, ''Principe Amedeo'' was moored in [[Naples]] when a severe storm tore the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Roma||2}} free from her anchors and knocked her into ''Principe Amedeo''. Neither ship was damaged in the collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stray Foreign Facts|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 November 1881|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B04E3DC113CEE3ABC4B51DFB767838A699FDE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the annual fleet maneuvers held in 1885, ''Principe Amedeo'' served as the [[flagship]] of the &quot;Eastern Squadron&quot;, with [[Rear Admiral]] Civita commanding. She was joined by the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Castelfidardo||2}}, the [[corvette]] {{ship|Italian corvette|Amerigo Vespucci||2}}, a [[sloop]], and four [[torpedo boat]]s. The &quot;Eastern Squadron&quot; defended against an attacking &quot;Western Squadron&quot;, simulating a Franco-Italian conflict, with operations conducted off [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; During the exercises, ''Principe Amedeo'' was forced to &quot;surrender&quot; by the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1888 to 1889, ''Principe Amedeo'' was employed as the [[headquarters ship]] for the forces defending [[Taranto]].&lt;ref name=G340/&gt; By this time, she had been equipped with six {{convert|2.9|in|abbr=on}} guns for close-range defense, six [[machine gun]]s, and two [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Clowes, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was stricken from the [[naval register]] on 28 March 1895 and thereafter used as an ammunition [[depot ship]] in Taranto. She was eventually [[ship breaking|broken up for scrap]] in 1910.&lt;ref name=G340/&gt;
