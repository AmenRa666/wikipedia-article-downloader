'''''Cap Arcona''''', named after [[Cape Arkona]] on the island of [[Rügen]], was a large German [[ocean liner]] built for the [[Hamburg Süd|Hamburg Südamerikanische Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft]] (&quot;Hamburg-South America Line&quot;). She carried passengers and cargo between Germany and the east coast of South America, and in her time was the largest and quickest ship on the route.&lt;ref name=Talbot-Booth&gt;{{harvnb|Talbot-Booth|1936|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 the [[Kriegsmarine]] requisitioned her as an [[Barracks ship|accommodation ship]]. In 1942 she served as the set for the German propaganda feature film [[Titanic (1943 film)|''Titanic'']]. In 1945 she evacuated almost 26,000 German soldiers and civilians from [[East Prussia]] before the advance of the [[Red Army]].

''Cap Arcona''{{'}}s final use was as a [[prison ship]]. In May 1945 she was heavily laden with prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps]] when the [[Royal Air Force]] sank her, killing about 5,000 people; with more than 2,000 further casualties in the sinkings of the accompanying vessels of the prison fleet; {{SS|Deutschland|1923|6}} and {{SS|Thielbek|1940|2}}. This was one of the biggest single-incident maritime losses of life in the Second World War.

==Building and equipment==
[[File:Cap Arcona.JPG|thumb|Plans of the ''Cap Arcona'']]

[[Blohm &amp; Voss]] in [[Hamburg]] built ''Cap Arcona'', launching and completing her in 1927. She was {{GRT|27561}}, {{convert|205.90|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[Length overall|overall]] and had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|25.78|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1988|pp=78-79}}

She was driven by eight [[Steam turbine#Marine propulsion|steam turbines]], single-reduction geared to two [[propeller]] shafts.&lt;ref name=LR30&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30b0209.pdf |year=1930 |title=Lloyd's Register, Steamers &amp; Motorships |location=London |publisher=[[Lloyd's Register]] |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had three funnels, and her passenger comforts included a full-size tennis court abaft her third funnel.&lt;ref name=Talbot-Booth/&gt; The ship had at least 26 [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], most of which were mounted in two tiers (see image).

''Cap Arcona'' had modern navigation and communication equipment. She was equipped for [[Underwater acoustic communication|submarine signalling]], which for a time was considered an alternative to radio. She also had wireless [[direction finding]] equipment,&lt;ref name=LR30/&gt; and from 1934 she had an [[echo sounding]] device and a [[gyrocompass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=34b0158.pdf |year=1934 |title=Lloyd's Register, Steamers &amp; Motorships |location=London |publisher=[[Lloyd's Register]] |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

==Pre-war service==

On 6 October 1932, ''Cap Arcona'' collided with the French [[cargo ship]] {{SS|Agen||2}} in the [[North Sea]] off the [[Elbe 4 Lightship]]. ''Agen'' was beached, but later was refloated and escorted into [[Hamburg]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Fire in a British motor-vessel |day_of_week=Friday |date=7 October 1932 |page_number=23 |issue=46258 |column=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accommodation ship==
In 1940 the [[Kriegsmarine]] (German Navy) requisitioned ''Cap Arcona'', had her painted overall grey and used her in the [[Baltic Sea]] as an accommodation ship in Gotenhafen (formerly [[Gdynia]], Poland).

In 1942 ''Cap Arcona'' was used as a stand-in for {{RMS|Titanic}}, to supply outside locations for the filming of the [[Titanic (1943 film)|Nazi film version of the disaster]] in the harbour of [[Gdynia|Gotenhafen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marszal&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9124111/The-strange-sinking-of-the-Nazi-Titanic.html |title=The strange sinking of the Nazi Titanic |first1=Andrew |last1=Marszal |date=5 March 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zendran&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrnRTL4bYsY |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] |title=Nazi Titanic Revealed |first1=David |last1=Zendran |format=Video |date=May 21, 2012}} [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; The production was completed, although the first director, [[Herbert Selpin]], was arrested for disparaging remarks he made about Kriegsmarine sailors. His later self-destructive interrogation at the hands of Goebbels all but sealed his fate. He was found the next day hanged in his cell by his suspenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miro |first=Sergei |year=2014 |title=Treasure of Sanssouci Park |place= |publisher=Lulu Publishing Services |isbn=978-1-4834-1095-1 |page=140 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XVl7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after he had complained about German military personnel molesting the actresses and made disparaging remarks about the German war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url= http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/titanic-on-film/ |title=Titanic on Film |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=9 May 2014 |work=A Life At The Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evacuation of East Prussia==
On 31 January 1945, the Kriegsmarine reactivated her for [[Operation Hannibal]], where she was used to transport 25,795 German soldiers and civilians from [[East Prussia]] to safer areas in western Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=David |year=1997 |title=Wartime Disasters at Sea |place=Yeovil |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |isbn= |pages=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koberger, Jr |first=Charles W |year=1989 |title=Steel Ships, Iron Crosses, and Refugees |place=New York |publisher=Praeger |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; By now these trips were made very dangerous by [[Naval mine|mines]] and [[Soviet Navy#World War II: The Great Patriotic War|Soviet Navy]] submarines. On 30 January {{MV|Wilhelm Gustloff||2}}, carrying a total of 10,582 passengers and crew, was torpedoed by the {{ship|Soviet submarine|S-13}} and sank in 40 minutes. An estimated 9,400 people died. Early on the morning of 11 February, the same submarine torpedoed the {{GRT|14666}} {{SS|General von Steuben||2}} on its way to [[Copenhagen]] with military and civilian passengers, killing 3,500 people. On 20 February, ''Cap Arcona''{{'}}s captain, Johannes Gertz, shot himself in his cabin while berthed in Copenhagen rather than face another trip back to Gotenhafen.{{sfn|Jacobs|Pool|2004|p=32}}

On 30 March 1945, ''Cap Arcona'' finished her third and last trip between Gdynia and Copenhagen, carrying 9,000 soldiers and refugees. However, her turbines were completely worn out. They could only be partially repaired and her days of long-distance travel were over. She was decommissioned, returned to her owners Hamburg-Süd and ordered out of Copenhagen Harbour to Neustadt Bay.{{sfn|Jacobs|Pool|2004|pp=44–45}}

==Prison ship==
During March and April 1945, concentration camp prisoners from Scandinavian countries had been transported from all over the Reich to the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] near Hamburg, in the [[White Buses|White Bus]] programme co-ordinated through the Swedish Red Cross - with prisoners of other nationalities displaced to make room for them. Eventually [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] agreed that these Scandinavians, and selected others regarded as less harmful to Germany, could be transported through Denmark to freedom in Sweden. Then between the 16 and 28 April 1945, Neuengamme was systematically emptied of all its remaining prisoners, together other groups of concentration camp inmates and Soviet POWs; with the intention that they would be relocated to a secret new camp, either on the Baltic island of [[Fehmarn]]; or at [[Mysen]] in Norway where preparations were put in hand to house them under the control of concentration camp guards evacuated from [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wachsmann 2015 584&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wachsmann|first=Nikolaus|title=KL; A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps|year=2015|publisher=Little, Brown|pages=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, they were to be concealed from the advancing British and Canadian forces; and for this purpose the ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]'' assembled a prison flotilla of decommissioned ships in the [[Bay of Lübeck]], consisting of the liners ''Cap Arcona'' and {{SS|Deutschland|1923|2}}, the freighter {{SS|Thielbek|1940|2}},  and the motor launch {{SS|Athen|1936|2}}. Since the steering motors were out of use in ''Thielbek'' and the turbines were out of use in ''Cap Arcona'', ''Athen'' was used to transfer prisoners from [[Lübeck]] to the larger ships and between ships;{{sfn|Jacobs|Pool|2004|p=162}} they were locked below decks and in the holds, and denied food and medical attention.

[[File:2010 03 31 Cap Arcona 1b k.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Scale model of ''Cap Arcona'']]

On 30 April 1945 the two Swedish ships ''Magdalena'' and ''Lillie Matthiessen'', previously employed as support vessels for the White Bus evacuations, made a final rescue trip to Lübeck and back.  Amongst the prisoners rescued were some transferred from the prison flotilla. On the evening of 2 May 1945 more prisoners, mainly women and children from the [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthof]] and [[Mittelbau-Dora]] camps were loaded onto barges and brought out to the anchored vessels; although, as the Cap Arcona refused to accept any more prisoners, over eight hundred were returned to the beach at Neustadt in the morning of 3 May, where around five hundred were killed in their barges by machine-gunning, or beaten to death on the beach, their SS guards then seeking to make their escape unencumbered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 2015 111&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Michael|title=After Hitler: The Last Days of the Second World War in Europe|year=2015|publisher=John Murray|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|title=The Second World War; a complete history|year=1989|publisher=Weidenfled and Nicolson|pages=683–684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order to transfer the prisoners to the prison ships had come from [[Gauleiter]] [[Karl Kaufmann]] in Hamburg. Marc Buggeln has challenged Kaufmann's subsequent claim that he had been acting on orders from SS Headquarters in Berlin, arguing that the decision in fact resulted from political and business pressures from leading industrialists in Hamburg, who were already at this stage plotting with Kaufmann to hand the city over to British forces undefended and unharmed, and who consequently wished to whitewash away (literally so in the case of the Neuengamme concentration camp)&lt;ref name=&quot;Wachsmann 2015 584&quot;/&gt; all evidence for the prisoners' former presence within the city and its industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buggeln|first=Marc|title=Slave Labour in Nazi Concentration Camps|year=2014|publisher=OUP|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early May however, any relocation plans had been scotched by the rapid British military advance to the Baltic; so the SS leadership, which had moved to [[Flensburg Government|Flensburg]] on 28 April,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wachsmann 2015 584&quot;/&gt; discussed scuttling the ships with the prisoners still aboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 2015 111&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bond |first=DG |title=German history and German identity: Uwe Johnson's Jahrestage |publisher=Rodopi |year=1993 |place= |pages=150–151 |isbn=90-5183-459-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, at a war crimes tribunal, Kaufmann claimed that the prisoners were intended to be sent to Sweden although, as none of the ships carried Red Cross hospital markings, nor were they seaworthy, this was scarcely credible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 2015 111&quot;/&gt;  Georg-Henning Graf von Bassewitz-Behr, Hamburg's last [[SS and Police Leader|Higher SS and Police Leader]] (HSSPF), testified at the same trial that the prisoners were in fact to be killed &quot;in compliance with [[Himmler]]'s orders&quot;.&lt;ref name=vaughan&gt;{{harvnb|Vaughan|2004|pp=154–156.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kurt Rickert, who had worked for Bassewitz-Behr, testified at the Hamburg War Crimes Trial that he believed the ships were to be sunk by U-boats or Luftwaffe aircraft.{{sfn|Vaughan|2004|p=148}} Eva Neurath, who was present in Neustadt, and whose husband survived the disaster, said she was told by a police officer that the ships held convicts and were going to be blown up.{{sfn|Vaughan|2004|pp=156–157}}

On 2 May 1945, the British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] discovered the empty camp at Neuengamme, and reached the towns of Lübeck and [[Wismar]]. [[No. 6 Commando]], [[British 1st Special Service Brigade|1st Special Service Brigade]] commanded by [[Brigadier general (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Derek Mills-Roberts]], and [[British 11th Armoured Division|11th Armoured Division]], commanded by [[George Philip Bradley Roberts|Major-General George P. B. Roberts]], entered Lübeck without resistance. Lübeck contained a permanent [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] office in its function as a [[Bombing of Lübeck in World War II|Red Cross port]], and Mr. De Blonay of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] informed Major-General Roberts that 7,000–8,000 prisoners were aboard ships in the Bay of Lübeck.{{sfn|Till|1945|}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/raf-pilots-tricked-into-killing-10000-camp-survivors-at-end-of-war-634445.html |title=RAF pilots tricked into killing 10,000 camp survivors at end of war – Home News, UK |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=16 October 2000 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |place=London |first=Max |last=Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the afternoon of 3 May 1945, the British 5th reconnaissance regiment advanced northwards to Neustadt, witnessing the ships burning in the bay and rescuing some severely emaciated prisoners on the beach at Neustadt, but otherwise finding mostly the bodies of women and children massacred that morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Michael|title=After Hitler: The Last Days of the Second World War in Europe|year=2015|publisher=John Murray|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sinking==
On 3 May 1945, three days after [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's suicide]] and only one day before the [[German surrender at Lüneburg Heath|unconditional surrender of the German troops]] in northwestern Germany at [[Lüneburg Heath]] to [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field Marshal Montgomery]], ''Cap Arcona'', ''Thielbek'', and the passenger liner ''Deutschland'' were attacked as part of general strikes on shipping in the [[Baltic Sea]] by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Hawker Typhoon]]s of [[No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group (United Kingdom)|83 Group]] of the [[2nd Tactical Air Force]]. Through [[Ultra]] Intelligence, the Western Allies had become aware that most of the SS leadership and former concentration camp commandants had gathered with [[Heinrich Himmler]] in Flensburg, hoping to contrive an escape to Norway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wachsmann 2015 584&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Michael|title=After Hitler: The Last Days of the Second World War in Europe|year=2015|publisher=John Murray|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western allies had intercepted orders from the rump [[Karl Dönitz|Dönitz]] government, also at [[Flensburg Government|Flensburg]], that the SS leadership  were to be facilitated in escaping Allied capture—or otherwise issued with false naval uniforms to conceal their identities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=Max|title=Armageddon; The Battle for Germany 1944-45|year=2004|publisher=Macmillan|pages=567–568}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as Dönitz sought, while surrendering, to maintain the fiction that his administration had been free from involvement in the camps, or in Hitler's policies of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kershaw|first=Ian|title=The End; Germany 1944-45|year=2011|publisher=Allen Lane|pages=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft were from [[No. 184 Squadron RAF|No. 184 Squadron]], [[No. 193 Squadron RAF|No. 193 Squadron]], [[No. 263 Squadron RAF|No. 263 Squadron]], [[No. 197 Squadron RAF]], and [[No. 198 Squadron RAF|No. 198 Squadron]]. Besides four [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20 mm cannon]], these [[Hawker Typhoon#Specifications .28Typhoon Mk Ib.29|Hawker Typhoon Mark 1B]] fighter-bombers carried either eight HE [[High Explosive]] [[RP-3|&quot;60 lb&quot; RP-3 unguided rockets]] or two {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs.

None of the prison flotilla were Red Cross marked (although the ''Deutschland'' had previously been intended as a hospital ship, and retained one white painted funnel with a red cross), and all prisoners were concealed below deck, so the pilots in the attacking force were unaware that they were laden with concentration camp survivors. Swedish and Swiss Red Cross officials had informed British intelligence on 2 May 1945 of the presence of prisoners on ships at anchor in Lübeck Bay, but the information had failed to be passed on.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;From the Till report of June 1945:
&quot;The Intelligence Officer with 83 Group RAF has admitted on two occasions; first to Lt H. F. Ansell of this Team (when it was confirmed by a [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] present), and on a second occasion to the Investigating Officer when he was accompanied by Lt. H. F. Ansell, that a message was received on 2 May 1945 that these ships were loaded with [[Konzentrationslager|KZ]] prisoners but that, although there was ample time to warn the pilots of the planes who attacked these ships on the following day, by some oversight the message was never passed on...

From the facts and from the statement volunteered by the RAF Intelligence Officer, it appears that the primary responsibility for this great loss of life must fall on the British RAF personnel who failed to pass to the pilots the message they received concerning the presence of KZ prisoners on board these ships.&quot; See:  Jacobs and Pool, 2004 and Till, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF commanders ordering the strike believed that a flotilla of ships was being prepared in Lübeck Bay, to accommodate leading SS personnel fleeing to [[German occupation of Norway|German-controlled Norway]] in accordance with Dönitz's orders.{{sfn|Jacobs|Pool|2004|loc=inside front cover}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wlb-stuttgart.de/seekrieg/4505-bilder/cap-ohne-bug.jpg |title=''Cap Arcona'', May 1945 |publisher=Württembergische Landesbibliothek Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The ships are gathering in the area of Lübeck and Kiel. At SHAEF it is believed that important Nazis who have escaped from Berlin to Flensburg are onboard, and are fleeing to Norway or neutral countries&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 2015 111&quot;/&gt;

Equipped with lifejackets from locked storage compartments, most of the SS guards managed to jump overboard from ''Cap Arcona''. German trawlers sent to rescue ''Cap Arcona''{{'}}s crew members and guards managed to save 16 sailors, 400 SS men, and 20 SS women. Only 350 of the 5,000 former concentration camp inmates aboard ''Cap Arcona'' survived.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; From 2,800 prisoners on board the ''Thielbek'' only 50 were saved; whereas all 2,000 prisoners on the ''[[SS Deutschland (1923)|Deutschland]] '' were safely taken off onto the ''Athen'', before the ''Deutschland'' capsized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|title=The Second World War; a complete history|year=1989|publisher=Weidenfled and Nicolson|pages=684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAF Pilot Allan Wyse of No. 193 Squadron recalled, &quot;We used our cannon fire at the chaps in the water... we shot them up with 20 mm cannons in the water. Horrible thing, but we were told to do it and we did it. That's war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/history/00-03-07/f02-uk.html |work=Shanghai Star |date=7 March 2000 |title=British error killed WW2 camp inmates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severely damaged and set on fire, ''Cap Arcona'' eventually capsized. Photos of the burning ships, listed as ''Deutschland'', ''Thielbek'', and ''Cap Arcona'', and of the emaciated survivors swimming in the very cold Baltic Sea, around 7&amp;nbsp;°C (44.6&amp;nbsp;°F), were taken on a reconnaissance mission over the Bay of Lübeck by [[North American P-51 Mustang|F-6 Mustang]] (the photo-[[reconnaissance]] version of the P-51) of the [[USAAF]]'s [[18th Reconnaissance Squadron|161st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron]] around 1700 hrs, shortly after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www1.uni-hamburg.de/rz3a035//arcona.html |title=The Sinking of the Thielbek |publisher=.uni-hamburg.de |date= |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 1945, a British reconnaissance plane took photos of the two wrecks, ''Thielbek'' and ''Cap Arcona'',&lt;ref&gt;No. 19 German magazine ''Schiffe Menschen Schicksale'', ''Schnelldampfer &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; the Bay of Neustadt being shallow. The capsized hulk of ''Cap Arcona'' later drifted ashore, and the beached wreck was finally broken up in 1949. For weeks after the attack, bodies of victims washed ashore, where they were collected and buried in mass graves at [[Neustadt in Holstein]], [[Scharbeutz]] and [[Timmendorfer Strand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ik was 20 in 1944 |publisher= | year=1995 |first=Raymond |last=van Pée |url=http://www.getuigen.be/Getuigenis/Van-Pee-Raymond/tkst.htm |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of skeletons washed ashore over the next 30 years, with the last find in 1971.&lt;ref name=Schwarberg&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarberg|1998|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoners aboard the ships were of at least 30 nationalities: American, Belarusian, Belgian, Canadian, Czechoslovakian, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxembourger, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian,  Serbian, Spanish, Swiss, Ukrainian, and possibly others.&lt;ref name=Schwarberg/&gt;
