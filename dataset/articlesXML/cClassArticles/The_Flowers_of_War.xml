==Plot==
In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal [[Nanking massacre]].

As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their [[convent]] at a Western-run [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral. Here, John Miller ([[Christian Bale|Bale]]), an American [[mortician]] on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls.  He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape.

After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a [[chorale]] for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the [[virgin]]al schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13.

When the [[de facto]] leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo ([[Ni Ni|Ni]]), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party. As there are only 12 prostitutes, George, the dead priest's adoptive son, volunteers as well. Miller initially opposes their self-sacrificing decision, but ultimately assists in disguising them, using his skills as a mortician to adjust their makeup and cut their hair to appear like schoolgirls. The prostitutes also create knives out of broken windows and hide them in their cloaks.

The next day, the &quot;13 Flowers of Nanking&quot; are led away by the unsuspecting Japanese soldiers. After they depart, Miller hides the schoolgirls on the truck he repaired and, using a single-person permit provided by the father of a schoolgirl, drives out of Nanking. In the last scene, the truck is seen driving on a deserted highway heading west, away from the advancing Japanese army. The fate of the 13 Flowers remains unknown, apparently martyring themselves for the students' freedom.

==Production==
In December 2010, it was announced that the film would be made, and [[pre-production]] started the same month. They began shooting on location in [[Nanking|Nanjing]], China, on January 10, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie Insider&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieinsider.com/m8404/3/nanjing-heroes-/|title=13 Flowers of Nanjing (TBA) – Running Time, Budget, Production Details|publisher=MovieInsider.com|accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialogue of the film was shot about 40% in English and the rest in [[Mandarin Chinese]] (particularly in the [[Nanjing dialect]], distinct from [[Standard Chinese]]) and Japanese,&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie Insider&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieinsider.com/m8404/nanjing-heroes-/|title=13 Flowers of Nanjing (TBA) Movie|publisher=MovieInsider.com|accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Worst Previews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=21373|title=First Look: Christian Bale in &quot;The 13 Flowers of Nanjing&quot;|publisher=WorstPreviews.com|accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated production budget of $94 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Daily Rotation&quot;/&gt; which makes it the most expensive film in Chinese history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deadline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/tag/the-flowers-of-war/|title=OSCARS: Controversy Emerges As Deadline For Foreign-Language Film Entries Looms|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=No matter what wars or disasters happen in history, what surrounds these times is life, love, salvation and humanity. I hope those things are felt in this story. The human side of the story was more important to me than the background of the Nanjing massacre. Human nature, love and sacrifice – these are the things that are truly eternal. For me, the event is the historical background of the film. But the enduring question of the story is how the human spirit is expressed in wartime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Website&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflowersofwarthemovie.com/about.html|title=The Journey To The Screen|publisher=TheFlowersOfWarTheMovie.com|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=[[Zhang Yimou]] on the film's message.|width=35%|align=right}}

To distinguish the film from previous depictions of the same subject, [[Zhang Yimou|Zhang]] said that he tried to portray the Japanese invaders with multiple layers. Regarding Colonel Hasegawa's sympathetic features, he explained that &quot;in 1937, the militaristic notion among Japanese armies was very prevalent, and officers were not allowed to sing a homesick folk song, but we still wanted to endow this character with something special.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;China.org.cn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2011-12/22/content_24220759.htm|title='The Flowers of War': A special case for China's film industry|publisher=China.org.cn|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director articulated that his biggest, though challenging, accomplishment in the film was the creation of John Miller, saying that &quot;this kind of character, a foreigner, a drifter, a thug almost, becomes a hero and saves the lives of Chinese people. That has never ever happened in Chinese filmmaking, and I think it will never happen again in the future.&quot; Filming completed within 6 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toonari Post&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonaripost.com/2012/01/entertainment/filming-the-flowers-of-war-world-class-team-recreate-nanjing/|title=Filming ‘The Flowers of War,’ World Class Team Recreate Nanjing|publisher=ToonariPost.com|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One challenging aspect was what Zhang called the &quot;very slow pace&quot; of negotiation with the Chinese [[censorship]] authorities during the editing process.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/zhang-yimou-and-the-challenges-of-filming-in-china/|title=Zhang Yimou and the Challenges of Filming in China|publisher=[[Nytimes.com]] |accessdate=February 2, 2012|first=Larry|last=Rohter|date=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
On September 9, 2011, the film was retitled ''The Flowers of War'', after a 20-minute screening for prominent [[United States|U.S.]] film distributors and the media at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Slash Film&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/zhang-yimous-wwii-film-christian-bale-retitled-the-flowers-war/|title=Zhang Yimou’s WWII Film With Christian Bale Retitled ‘The Flowers of War’|publisher=SlashFilm.com|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zhang stated that the story in ''The Flowers of War'' differs from many other Chinese films on this subject as it is told from the perspectives of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollywood Reporter3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dark-knight-christian-bale-zhang-yimou-china-flowers-war-267220 |title=An Auteur + This Actor = Game Change|publisher=HollywoodReporter.com|accessdate=December 4, 2011|first=Pamela|last=McClintock|date=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, the first trailer was released, making way for an American trailer to be revealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Motion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xmx1s0_flowers-of-war-trailer-2_shortfilms|title=Flowers Of War trailer 2|publisher=DailyMotion.com|accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Film Informant&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefilminformant.com/2011/12/the-flowers-of-war-trailer-2/|title=The Flowers of War – Trailer 2|publisher=TheFilmInformant.com|accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Empire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=32279|title=The Flowers Of War Trailer Online|publisher=EmpireOnline.com|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/11/08/flowers-of-war-december-release/|title='Flowers of War' to receive late-December Oscar-qualifying release|publisher=Ew.com|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
On November 22, 2011, New Pictures Film requested an inflation in the minimum ticket price within China. When in negotiations with the eight cinema circuits in question, it resulted in a threat to boycott the movie over the distributors' share. Wu Hehu, the general manager of Shanghai United Cinema Circuit, made a statement, saying “this is a simple business situation. Without the agreement, we cannot screen the film.&quot; Zhang Weiping, [[Film producer|producer]] of ''The Flowers of War'' and [[Organization#Leadership in organizations|head]] of New Pictures Film, also refused to make any concessions. A letter was sent to the [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television|Film Bureau of SARFT]], hoping it would mediate the dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;All Business&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/movies-sound-recording/16735295-1.html|title=Chinese exhibitors to boycott Zhang Yimou's Flowers of War|publisher=AllBusiness.com|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the order of SARFT, both sides were to reach a compromise, which was achieved after four hours of negotiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Film Biz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/exhibitors-make-peace-with-war|title=Exhibitors make peace with War|publisher=FilmBiz.asia|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118046614?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title='Flowers of War' dispute defused|publisher=Variety.com|accessdate=December 4, 2011|first=Clifford|last=Coonan|date=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reaction===
The movie received mixed reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 42% critical approval rating with an average of 5.5/10.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_flowers_of_war/|title=The Flowers of War (2011)|publisher=RottenTomatoes.com|accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], another review aggregator, assigned the film an average score of 46 (out of 100) based on 22 reviews from mainstream critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metacritic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-flowers-of-war|title=The Flowers of War|publisher=Metacritic.com|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Twitch Film]] called it &quot;arguably the most eagerly-anticipated Chinese movie of the year&quot;, saying that &quot;''The Flowers of War'' is a big movie in every sense of the word, from its kinetic battle scenes to the beautiful photography and impressive performances from a mostly young and inexperienced cast.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Twitch Film&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/reviews/2011/12/the-flowers-of-war-review.php|title=THE FLOWERS OF WAR Review|publisher=TwitchFilm.com|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Hammond from ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice Magazine]]'' gave it 4 stars of 5, and said &quot;''The Flowers of War'' is ultimately an inspiring, stirring and unforgettable human drama in the face of a horrifying war. It is highly recommended.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Box Office Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemagazine.com/reviews/2011-12-the-flowers-of-war|title=The Flowers of War – Inside Movies Since 1920|publisher=BoxOfficeMagazine.com|accessdate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a generally positive review, describing the film as &quot;a uniquely harrowing account of the rape of Nanjing,&quot; and defined it as &quot;a work of often garish dramatic flourishes yet undeniable emotional power, finding humor and heartbreak in a tale of unlikely heroism in close quarters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117946733?refcatid=31|title=The Flowers of War|publisher=Variety.com|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Pulver describes it as &quot;a new dawn in China-Hollywood co-operation&quot;, arguing that &quot;this ambitious war film from Zhang Yimou is an attempt to turn the revolting aftermath of the 1937 Japanese assault on Nanjing into a globally friendly, putatively inspiring epic that also aims to underscore the US and China's geopolitical mutual respect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/14/flowers-of-war-berlin-2012|title = The Flowers of War – review|last = Pulver|first = Andrew|date = 2012-02-14|newspaper = The Guardian|language = en-GB|issn = 0261-3077|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most negative feedback from critics were similar to that from ''[[Toronto Star]]'', which gave the film 2.5/4, and said that &quot;the drama is often weakened by the penchant for creating spectacles.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toronto Star&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.toronto.com/article/714620--the-flowers-of-war-the-price-of-innocence-in-a-world-gone-mad|title=The Flowers of War: the price of innocence in a world gone mad|publisher=Toronto.com|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]], who gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, took issue with making the story about a white American, &quot;Can you think of any reason the character John Miller is needed to tell his story? Was any consideration given to the possibility of a Chinese priest? Would that be asking for too much?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Chicago Sun Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120118/REVIEWS/120119985|title=Flowers of War|publisher=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
