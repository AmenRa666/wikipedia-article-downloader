The '''45th Infantry Division''' was an [[infantry]] [[Division (military)|division]] of the [[United States Army]], part of the [[Oklahoma Army National Guard]], from 1920 to 1968. Headquartered mostly in [[Oklahoma City]], the guardsmen fought in both [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. They trace their lineage from frontier [[militia]]s that operated in the [[Southwestern United States]] throughout the late 1800s.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The 45th Infantry Division guardsmen saw no major action until they became one of the first National Guard units activated in World War II in 1941. They took part in intense fighting during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] and the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|attack on Salerno]] in the 1943 [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]]. Slowly advancing through [[Italy]], they [[Battle of Anzio|fought in Anzio]] and [[Battle of Monte Cassino|in Monte Cassino]]. After landing in [[France]] during [[Operation Dragoon]], they joined the 1945 [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|drive into Germany]] that ended the [[European theatre of World War II|War in Europe]].

After  brief inactivation and subsequent reorganization as a unit restricted to Oklahomans, the division returned to duty in 1951 for the Korean War. It joined the [[United Nations]] troops on the front lines during the [[Korean War#Stalemate (July 1951 – July 1953)|stalemate]] of the second half of the war, with constant, low-level fighting and [[trench warfare]] against the [[People's Volunteer Army]] of [[China]] that produced little gain for either side. The division remained on the front lines in such engagements as [[Battle of Old Baldy Hill|Old Baldy Hill]] and [[Battle of Hill Eerie|Hill Eerie]] until the end of the war, returning to the U.S. in 1954.

The division remained a National Guard formation until its inactivation in 1968 as part of a downsizing of the Guard. Several units were activated to replace the division and carry on its lineage. Over the course of its history, the 45th Infantry Division sustained over 25,000 battle casualties, and its men were awarded nine [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]], twelve [[campaign streamer]]s, the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] and the [[Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation]].

==History==
With the outbreak of [[World War I]], troops of the National Guard were formed into the units which exist today, with the [[Colorado Army National Guard|Colorado Guard]] forming the [[157th Field Artillery Regiment|157th Infantry Regiment]], the [[Arizona Army National Guard|Arizona Guard]] forming the [[158th Infantry Regiment (United States)|158th Infantry Regiment]], and the [[New Mexico Army National Guard|New Mexico Guard]] forming the [[120th Engineer Regiment (United States)|120th Engineer Regiment]]. These units were attached to the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]] and deployed to [[France]] where they were used as &quot;depot&quot; forces to provide replacements for front-line units. They returned home at the end of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oklahoma Army National Guard|Oklahoma Guard]] units that would later become the [[179th Infantry Regiment (United States)|179th Infantry Regiment]] and [[180th Cavalry Regiment|180th Infantry Regiment]] were assigned to the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] and would earn a combat participation credit during the [[Meuse-Argonne Campaign]] (26 September – 11 November 1918) in France as the [[142nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|142nd Infantry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=142nd Infantry Regiment|url=http://www.texasmilitaryforcesmuseum.org/36division/archives/142/ch001.htm|publisher=Texas Military Forces Museum|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 1920, the Oklahoma State militia was organized as the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, and manned with troops from [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath234&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McGrath|2004|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division was formed and federally recognized as a National Guard unit on 3 August 1923 in [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson663&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|p=663}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was assigned the 89th Infantry Brigade of the Colorado and Arizona National Guards, and the 90th Infantry Brigade of the Oklahoma National Guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath171&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McGrath|2004|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of these militia roots, when the division was properly organized, many of its members were marksmen and outdoorsmen from the remote frontier regions of the Southwestern United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit11&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division's first commander was [[Major General]] Baird H. Markham.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 45th Infantry Division engaged in regular drills but no major events in its first few years, though the division's Colorado elements were called in to help quell a large coal mining strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit19&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s severely curtailed its funding for training and equipment. Major General Roy Hoffman took command in 1931, followed by Alexander M. Tuthill, Alexander E. McPherren in 1935, and William S. Key in 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit18&quot; /&gt; In 1937, the division's troops were once again called up, this time to help manage a [[locust]] plague affecting Colorado.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit19&quot; /&gt;

[[File:45th Infantry insignia (swastika).svg|thumb|150px|left|Before the 1930s, the division's symbol was a red square with a yellow [[swastika]], a tribute to the large Native American population in the southwestern United States.|alt=A red diamond with a yellow swastika inside it]]
The division's [[Western use of the Swastika in the early 20th century|original]] [[shoulder sleeve insignia]], approved in August 1924,&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit20&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured a  [[swastika]], a common Native American symbol, as a tribute to the Southwestern United States region which had a large population of Native Americans. However, with the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], with its infamous swastika symbol, the 45th Division stopped using the insignia.&lt;ref name=&quot;SY18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stout|Yeide|2007|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a long process of submissions for new designs, a new shoulder sleeve insignia, designed by a [[Carnegie, Oklahoma]] native named Woody Big Bow,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|2009|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]], another Native American symbol, was approved in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitlock21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1941, the 45th Infantry Division took part in the [[Louisiana Maneuvers]], the largest peacetime exercises in U.S. military history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit5&quot; /&gt; It was assigned to [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] with the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] and the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]], camped near Pitkin, Louisiana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit9&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still operating with outmoded equipment from World War I, the division did not perform well during these exercises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With poor weather and bad equipment, the undertrained 45th Infantry Division was criticized by officers who considered it &quot;feeble&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit9&quot; /&gt; In spite of these deficiencies, less than one month later, the men were recalled to the [[active duty]] force, much to their chagrin, because of concerns of an impending American entry into [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;On 16 September 1941, the 45th Infantry Division, under [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[William S. Keys]], was [[federalization of the National Guard|federalized]] from state control into the regular army force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson663&quot;/&gt; It was one of four National Guard divisions to be federalized, alongside the [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th]], the [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st]] and [[44th Infantry Division (United States)|44th Infantry Division]]s, originally for a one-year period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its men immediately began [[basic combat training]] at [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit10&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 1942, it continued this training at [[Camp Barkeley]], [[Texas]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit2228&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|pp=22–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to [[Fort Devens]], [[Massachusetts]], to undergo [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] training in preparation for an invasion of [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum&quot;/&gt; It then moved to [[Fort Drum|Pine Camp]], [[New York (state)|New York]] briefly for [[Arctic warfare|winter warfare]] training, but was hampered by continuously poor weather. In January 1943 it moved to [[Fort Pickett]], [[Virginia]], for its final training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit29&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division, now commanded by Major General [[Troy H. Middleton|Troy Middleton]], moved to the [[Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation]] embarkation's [[Camp Patrick Henry]] to await combat loading on the transports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bykofsky&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bykofsky|1990|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The division's two combat commands, the [[89th Infantry Brigade (United States)|89th]] and [[90th Brigade (United States)|90th Infantry Brigade]]s, were not activated, as the army favored smaller and more versatile regimental commands for the new conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath171&quot;/&gt; The 45th Infantry Division was instead based around the [[157th Field Artillery Regiment|157th]], [[179th Infantry Regiment (United States)|179th]], and [[180th Cavalry Regiment|180th Infantry Regiment]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac592&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1959|p=592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also assigned to the division were the [[158th Field Artillery Regiment|158th]], [[160th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|160th]], [[171st Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|171st]], and [[189th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|189th Field Artillery Battalion]]s, the 45th Signal Company, the [[700th Support Battalion (United States)|700th Ordnance Company]], the 45th Quartermaster Company, the 45th Reconnaissance Troop, the 120th Engineer Combat Battalion, and the 120th Medical Battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac592&quot;/&gt;

The 45th Division sailed from the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation for the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean]] region on 8 June 1943, [[Combat loading|combat loaded]] aboard thirteen attack transports and five cargo attack vessels as convoy UGF-9 headed by the communications ship {{USS|Ancon|AGC-4|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blumenson|1999|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bykofsky&quot;/&gt; By the time the 45th Division landed in North Africa on 22 June 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had largely secured the [[North African Campaign|African theater]]. As a result, the division was not sent into combat upon arrival and instead commenced training at [[Arzew]], [[French Morocco]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac544&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1959|p=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; in preparation for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]]. Allied intelligence estimated that the island was defended by approximately 230,000 troops, the majority of which were drawn mostly from weak Italian formations and two German divisions which had been reconstituted after being destroyed earlier. Against this, the Allies planned to land 180,000 troops,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|2003|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the 45th Infantry Division, which was assigned to Major General [[Omar Bradley]]'s [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]], part of the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. Seventh Army]] under [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton|George Patton]], for the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:45th Infantry Division en route to Sicily 1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Troops of the 45th Infantry Division in a transport bound for Sicily, June 1943.]]

The division was subsequently assigned a lead role in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|amphibious assault on Sicily]], coming ashore on 10 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Axelrod|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landing near [[Scoglitti]], the southernmost U.S. objective on the island, the division advanced north on the U.S. force's eastern flank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|2003|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially encountering resistance from armor of the [[1st Fallschirm-Panzer Division Hermann Göring|Herman Goering Division]], the division advanced, supported by [[paratrooper]]s of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[James M. Gavin|James Gavin]]'s [[505th Infantry Regiment (United States)|505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team]], part of the [[82nd Airborne Division|U.S. 82nd Airborne Division]], who landed inland on 11 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir, p. 184&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 82nd paratroopers, conducting their first combat jump of the war, then set up to protect the 45th's flank against German counterattack, but without weapons to counter heavy armor, the paratroopers had to rely on support from U.S. armored units to repulse the German [[Tiger I|Tiger I tank]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir, p. 184&quot;/&gt; As the division advanced towards its main objective to capture the airfields at [[Biscari, Sicily|Biscari]] and [[Comiso, Sicily|Comiso]], German forces pushed back.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Axelrod|2006|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the first two weeks while the division moved slowly north, it encountered only light resistance from Italian forces fighting delaying actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garland|Smyth|1965|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian and German forces resisted fiercely at Motta Hill on 26 July, however, and for four days the 45th Infantry Division was held up there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garland|Smyth|1965|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, division was allocated to drive towards [[Messina]], being ordered by Patton to cover the distance as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Axelrod|2006|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 45th spent a few days in that city, but on 1 August, the division was withdrawn from the front line for rest and rear-guard patrol duty,&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac544&quot;/&gt; after which the division was assigned to Major General [[Ernest J. Dawley|Ernest Dawley]]'s [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]], part of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], under Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]], in preparation for the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of mainland Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim140&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pimlott|1995|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Salerno====
On 3 September, Italy surrendered to the Allied powers. Hoping to occupy as much of the country as possible before the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] could react, the U.S. Fifth Army prepared to [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|attack Salerno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blumenson|1999|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 1943, the division conducted its second landing at Agropoli and Paestum with the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]], on the southernmost beaches of the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim140&quot;/&gt; Opposing them were elements of the German [[29th Infantry Division (Germany)|29th Panzergrenadier Division]] and [[XVI Panzer Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim140&quot;/&gt; Against stiff resistance, the 45th pushed to the [[Calore River]] after a week of [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|heavy fighting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1959|p=545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fifth Army was battered and pushed back by German forces until 20 September, when Allied forces were finally able to break out and establish a more secure beachhead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim140&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|2003|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November it crossed the [[Volturno Line|Volturno River]] and took [[Venafro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; The division had great difficulty moving across the rivers and through the mountainous terrain, and the advance was slow. After linking up with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], which had advanced from the south, the combined force, under the [[15th Army Group]], commanded by British [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]], was stalled when it reached the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pimlott|1995|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 9 January 1944, the division, now under Major General [[William W. Eagles (United States Army officer)|William W. Eagles]] (replacing Middleton who was sent to [[England]] to command [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] in the [[invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]]), inched forward into the mountains reaching St. Elia, north of [[Monte Cassino]], before moving to a rest area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt;

Allied forces conducted a frontal assault on the Gustav Line stronghold at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]], and VI Corps, [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Infantry Division]] included, was assigned to [[Battle of Anzio|Operation Shingle]], detached from the 15th Army Group to land behind enemy lines at [[Anzio]] on 22 January 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim142&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pimlott|1995|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this mission, CCA (Combat Command A) of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] was attached to the 45th Infantry Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2007|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landing on schedule, VI Corps surprised the Germans, but [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[John P. Lucas]]'s decision to consolidate the beachhead instead of attacking gave the Germans time to bring the [[LXXVI Panzer Corps]] forward to oppose the landings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim142&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|2003|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One regiment of the 45th (the [[179th Infantry Regiment (United States)|179th]]) went ashore with the landings. In company with the British 1st Division, they advanced north along the Anzio-Albano road and captured the Aprilia &quot;factory&quot;, but encountered heavy resistance from German armored units a few miles further on. Lucas then ordered the rest of the division ahore. The 45th Division was deployed on the southeastern side of the [[beachhead]], along [[Pontine Marshes#Bonifica integrale|the lower Mussolini Canal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CMH-Anzio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/anzio/72-19.htm|title=ANZIO 1944|publisher=The U.S. Army Center of Military History|access-date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 1944, when VI Corps advanced from the beaches, it encountered heavy resistance and took heavy casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim142&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|2003|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; VI Corps was stopped at the &quot;Pimlott Line&quot; (the perimeter of the beachhead), and the fight became a [[Attrition warfare|battle of attrition]].

The first major German counterattack came in early February, was against British 1st Division. Two regiments of the 45th (the 179th and [[157th Field Artillery Regiment|157th]]) were sent to the Aprilia sector to reinforce the British. The 179th Infantry and a tank battalion of CCA tried to recapture Aprilia but were repulsed. Lucas then moved the rest of the 45th Division to the left-center of the perimeter, at Aprilia and along the west branch of the Mussolini Canal.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMH-Anzio&quot;/&gt; For the next four months the 45th Infantry Division was mostly stuck in place, holding its ground during repeated German counterattacks, and subjected to bombardment from aircraft and artillery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt;

On 16 February, a major German attack struck the 45th, and nearly broke through the 179th Infantry on 18 February. Lucas sent famed [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]] leader [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[William Orlando Darby|William O. Darby]] to assume command of the 157th, and the Germans were repulsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMH-Anzio&quot;/&gt;

On 23 May, VI Corps went on the offensive, breaking out of the beachhead to the northeast, with the 45th Division forming the left half of the attack. By 31 May, the German defenses were shattered, and the 45th Division turned northwest, toward the Alban Hills and Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMH-ROME-ARNO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/romar/72-20.htm|title=ROME-ARNO 1944|publisher=The U.S. Army Center of Military History|access-date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June the 45th crossed the [[Tiber River]] below Rome, and entered the city along with other VI Corps troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier60&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|2003|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men of the 45th Division were the first Allied troops to reach [[Vatican City|the Vatican]].

On 16 June, the 45th Division withdrew for rest in preparation for other operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; At this time, VI Corps was attached to the Seventh United States Army, [[Sixth United States Army Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Order184&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|1945|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 45th, 36th, and [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry]] divisions were pulled from the line in Italy in preparation for [[Operation Dragoon|Operation ''Dragoon'']] (formerly ''Anvil''), the invasion of southern France. ''Dragoon'' was originally planned to coincide with the [[Normandy landings]] in the north, but was delayed until August because of a shortage of landing craft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim166&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pimlott|1995|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France and Germany====
[[File:Operation Dragoon - map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Tactical map of Operation Dragoon|alt=A map of southern France with the 45th Infantry Division landing at the center of a large invasion force.]]
The 45th Infantry Division participated in its fourth assault landing during [[Operation Dragoon]] on 15 August 1944, at [[St. Maxime]], in Southern France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; The division landed its 157th and 180th [[regimental combat team]]s and captured the heights of the [[Chaines de Mar]] before meeting the [[1st Special Service Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SY29&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stout|Yeide|2007|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German Army, reeling from the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]], pulled back after a short fight, part of an overall German withdrawal to the east following the landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pimlott|1995|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SY30&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stout|Yeide|2007|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers of the 45th Infantry Division engaged the dispersed forces of German [[Army Group G]], suffering very few casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier60&quot;/&gt; The Seventh Army, along with [[Free French]] forces, were able to advance north quickly. By 12 September, the Seventh Army linked up with the [[United States Army Central|Third United States Army]], advancing from [[Normandy]], joining the two forces at [[Dijon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim166&quot;/&gt; Against slight opposition, it spearheaded the drive for the [[Belfort Gap]]. The 45th Infantry Division took the strongly defended city of [[Epinal]] on 24 September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; The division was then reassigned to [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] for its next advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order184&quot;/&gt; On 30 September the division crossed the [[Moselle River]] and entered the western foothills of the [[Vosges]], taking [[Rambervillers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; It would remain in the area for a month waiting for other units to catch up before crossing the [[Mortagne River]] on 23 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; The division remained on the line with the [[Sixth United States Army Group]], the southernmost of three Army Groups advancing through France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pimlott|1995|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:45th Division roadblock, Battle of the Bulge.JPG|thumb|left|Men of the 1st Battalion, 157th Infantry Regiment manning a roadblock during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944.]]

After the crossing was complete, the division was relieved from V Corps and assigned to [[XV Corps (United States)|XV Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Order184&quot;/&gt; The division was allowed a one-month rest, resuming its advance on 25 November, attacking the forts north of [[Mutzig]]. These forts had been designed by [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] in 1893 to block access to the plain of [[Alsace]]. The 45th Division next crossed the Zintzel River before pushing through the [[Maginot Line]] defenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; During this time much of the division's artillery assets were attached to the [[44th Infantry Division (United States)|44th Infantry Division]] to provide additional support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order183&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|1945|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 45th Infantry Division was reassigned to VI Corps on New Year's Day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order184&quot;/&gt; From 2 January 1945, the division fought defensively along the German border, withdrawing to the [[Moder River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; It sent half of its artillery to support the [[70th Infantry Division (United States)|70th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Order183&quot;/&gt; On 17 February the division was pulled off the line for rest and training. Once this rest period was complete, the division was assigned to XV Corps for the final push into German territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Order184&quot;/&gt; The 45th moved north to the [[Sarreguemines]] area and smashed through the [[Siegfried Line]], on 17 March taking Homburg on the 21st and crossing the Rhine between Worms and Hamm on the 26th.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; The advance continued, with [[Aschaffenburg]] falling on 3 April, and [[Nuremberg]] on the 20th.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; The division crossed the [[Danube River]] on 27 April, and liberated 32,000 captives of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] on 29 April 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; The division captured [[Munich]] during the next two days, occupying the city until [[V-E Day]] and the surrender of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|2003|p=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next month, the division remained in Munich and set up collection points and camps for the massive numbers of surrendering troops of the German armies. The number of POWs taken by the 45th Division during its almost two years of fighting totalled 124,840 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac545&quot;/&gt; The division was then slated to move to the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater of operations]] to participate in the [[Operation Downfall|invasion of mainland Japan]] on the island of [[Honshu]], but these plans were scrubbed before the division could depart after the [[surrender of Japan]], on [[V-J Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|2003|p=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criminal allegations====
{{see also|Biscari massacre|Dachau massacre}}
After the war, [[Court-martial|courts-martial]] were convened to investigate possible [[war crimes]] by members of the division. In the first case, dubbed the [[Biscari massacre]], American troops from C Company, 180th Infantry Regiment, were alleged to have shot 74 Italian and two German prisoners in [[Acate]] in July 1943 following the capture of an airfield in the area. [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton|George Patton]], the [[Seventh United States Army|Seventh Army]] commander, asked [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Omar Bradley]], commanding [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]], to get the case dismissed to prevent bad press, but Bradley refused. A non-commissioned officer later confessed to the crimes and was found guilty, but an officer who claimed he had only been following orders was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkinson|2007|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Botting|Sayer|1989|pp=354–359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit389&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Killed SS Cammo Dachau.jpg|thumb|left|Dead German troops near [[Dachau Concentration Camp]], allegedly killed in the [[Dachau massacre]] in 1945.]]

In a second incident, the Army considered court-martialling several officers of the 157th Infantry Regiment under [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Felix L. Sparks]] after servicemen were accused of massacring German soldiers who were surrendering at the Dachau [[concentration camp]] in 1945. Some of the German troops were camp guards; the others were sick and wounded troops from a nearby hospital. The soldiers of the 45th Division who liberated the camp were outraged at the malnourishment and maltreatment of the 32,000 prisoners they liberated, some barely alive, and all victims of the [[Holocaust]]. After entering the camp, the soldiers found boxcars filled with dead bodies of prisoners who had succumbed to starvation or last-minute executions, and in rooms adjacent to [[gas chambers]] they found naked bodies piled from the floor to the ceiling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit360–364&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|pp=360–364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cremation ovens, which were still in operation when the soldiers arrived, contained bodies and skeletons as well. Some of the victims apparently had died only hours before the 45th Division entered the camp, while many others lay where they had died in states of decomposition that overwhelmed the soldiers' senses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit359&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts conflict over what happened and over how many German troops were killed. After investigating the incident, the Army considered court-martialling several officers involved, but Patton successfully intervened. Seventh Army was being disbanded and Patton had been appointed Military Governor of Bavaria, placing the matter in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sparks|first1=Felix|title=Liberation of Dachau|url=http://www.45thinfantrydivision.com/index14.htm|website=Albert R. Panebianco's World War II Website|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some veterans of the 45th Infantry Division have said that only 30 to 50 German soldiers were killed and that very few were killed trying to surrender, while others have admitted to killing or refusing to treat wounded German guards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit365&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|pp=365–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the 45th Division fought in 511 days of combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac544&quot;/&gt; Nine soldiers were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] during their service with the 45th Infantry Division: [[Van T. Barfoot]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit292&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Childers]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit103&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Almond E.

Lara will be awarded the Medal of Honor|newspaper=[[The Press-Enterprise]]|date=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack C. Montgomery]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit245&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James D. Slaton]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit103&quot;/&gt; [[Jack Treadwell]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit343&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edward G. Wilkin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit345&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Whitlock|2005|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers of the division also received 61 [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]es, three [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]]s, 1,848 [[Silver Star Medal]]s, 38 [[Legion of Merit]] medals, 59 [[Soldier's Medal]]s, 5,744 [[Bronze Star Medal]]s, and 52 [[Air Medal]]s. The division received seven [[distinguished unit citations]] and eight [[campaign streamer]]s during the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Almanac544&quot;/&gt; The division suffered 3,650 [[killed in action]], 13,729 [[wounded in action]], 3,615 [[missing in action]], 266 captured, and 41,647 non-battle casualties for a total of 62,907 casualties during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|1945|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the division returned to New York in September 1945, and from there went to [[Camp Bowie, Texas|Camp Bowie]], Texas. On 7 December 1945, the division was deactivated from the active duty force and its members reassigned to other Army units. The following year, on 10 September 1946, the 45th Infantry Division was reconstituted as a National Guard unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson665&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|p=665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of comprising units from several states, the post-war 45th was an all-Oklahoma organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Don25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the division was also reorganized and as a part of this process the 157th Infantry was removed from the division's order of battle and replaced with the [[279th Infantry Regiment (United States)|279th Infantry Regiment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Don230&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the U.S. Army underwent a drastic reduction in size. At the end of World War II, it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, there were just 10 active divisions in the force, along with a few reserve divisions such as the 45th Infantry Division which were combat-ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|2005|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division retained many of its best officers as senior commanders as the force downsized, and it enjoyed a good relationship with its community. The 45th in this time was regarded as one of the better-trained National Guard divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, by mid-1950 the division had only 8,413 troops, less than 45 percent&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;As of 1 August 1950, the division consisted of 698 [[commissioned officer]]s, 64 [[warrant officer]]s, and 7,651 [[enlisted men]]. Army doctrine dictated a fully manned infantry division at 910 officers, 132 warrant officers, and 17,460 enlisted men. The National Guard at the time was operating at a reduced authorization of 851 officers, 130 enlisted men, and 12,777 enlisted men. See {{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of its full-strength authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 10 percent of the division's officers and 5 percent of its enlisted men had combat experience with the division from World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean War===

At the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950, the U.S. Army looked to expand its force again to prepare for major conflict.  After the [[North Korean People's Army]] invaded the [[Republic of Korea]] four understrength U.S. divisions on occupation duty in Japan were rushed to South Korea to stand alongside the [[Republic of Korea Army]]. These were the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]], the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]], and the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], which were all under the control of the [[Eighth United States Army]]. Due to drastic reductions in U.S. military spending following the end of World War II, these divisions were equipped with worn-out or obsolete weaponry and suffered from a shortage of anti-armor weapons capable of penetrating the hulls of the [[North Korea]]n [[T-34]] tanks.&lt;ref name=Stewart222&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|2005|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reinforcement pool ====
Initially, the division was used to provide a pool of reinforcements for the divisions which had been sent to the Korean War theater, and in January 1951 it provided 650 enlisted fillers for overseas service. Later that month, it was given 4,006 new recruits for its three infantry regiments and artillery assets, and each unit created a 14-week training program to prepare these new soldiers for combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of heavy casualties and slow reinforcement rates, the Army looked to the National Guard to provide additional units to relieve the beleaguered Eighth Army. At the time, the 45th Infantry Division was comprised overwhelmingly of [[high school]] students or recent graduates and only about 60 percent of its divisional troops had conducted training and drills with the division for a year or more. Additionally, only about 20 percent of its personnel had prior experience of military service from World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the division was one of four National Guard divisions identified as being among the most prepared for combat based on the effectiveness of its equipment, training, and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in February 1951, the 45th Infantry Division was alerted that it would sail for Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for the deployment, the division was sent to [[Fort Polk]], [[Louisiana]], to begin training and to fill its ranks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var101&quot;/&gt; After its basic training was complete, the division was sent to Japan in April 1951 for advanced training and to act as a reserve force for the Eighth United States Army, then fighting in Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var102&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The involvement of the National Guard in the fighting in Korea was further expanded when the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]] of the [[California Army National Guard]] received warning orders for deployment as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Initial struggles ====
[[File:120th Engineer Battalion soldier in Korea, 1952.jpg|thumb|alt=A man in military uniform constructs a net in a hilly outdoor environment |A soldier of the 120th Engineer Battalion, 45th Infantry Division sets up camouflage net near the front lines in Korea in 1952.]]
On 1 September 1951, the 45th Infantry Division was activated as the first National Guard division to be deployed to the Far East theater since World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var101&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was not deployed to Korea until December 1951, when its advanced training was complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var102&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its arrival, the division moved to the front line to replace the 1st Cavalry Division, who were then delegated to the Far East reserve, having suffered over 16,000 casualties in less than 18 months of fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the 45th remained ''de facto'' [[Segregation in the United States military|segregated]] as an all-white unit in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual unit commanders went to great lengths to integrate reinforcements from different areas and ethnicity into their units.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1952, it was fully integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in an effort to reduce the burden on the National Guard,&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Fearing political ramifications, Army leaders sought to prevent large numbers of casualties from any one state, and the 45th Infantry Division was an all-Oklahoma organization at the beginning of the war. See: {{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; troops from the division were often replaced by enlisted and drafted soldiers from the active duty force. When it arrived in Korea, only half the division's manpower were National Guard troops, and over 4,500 guardsmen left between May and July 1952, continually replaced by more active duty troops, including an increasing number of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the division was no longer an &quot;All-Oklahoma&quot; unit, leaders opted to keep its designation as the 45th Infantry Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;Don122&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;As a result of this effort, two 45th Infantry Division units existed between 1952 and 1953; the mostly Active-duty 45th Infantry Division (AUS) in Korea, and the National Guard 45th Infantry Division (NGUS) in Oklahoma. In practice, the military institutionally recognized the Korea unit as the only &quot;official&quot; division, and most of the returning Oklahoma guardsmen were either separated from the Guard at the end of their enlistments or remained in inactive reserve status. See: {{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the division was in place, the battle lines on both sides had [[Korean War#Stalemate (July 1951 – July 1953)|largely solidified]], leaving the 45th Infantry Division in a stationary position as it conducted attacks and counterattacks for the same ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var24&quot;/&gt; The division was put under the command of Eighth Army's [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] for most of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was deployed around [[Chorwon]] and assigned to protect the key routes from that area into [[Seoul]]. The terrain was difficult and the weather was poor in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division suffered its first casualty on 11 December 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the division did not fare well, though it improved quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var102&quot;/&gt; Its anti-aircraft and armor assets were used as mobile artillery, which continuously pounded Chinese positions. The 45th, in turn, was under constant artillery and mortar attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also conducted constant small-unit patrols along the border seeking to engage Chinese outposts or patrols. These small-unit actions made up the majority of the division's combat in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese troops were well dug-in and better trained than the troops of the inexperienced 45th, and it suffered casualties and frequently had to disengage when it was attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2001|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the division's first few months on the line, Chinese forces conducted three raids in its sector. In retaliation, the 245th Tank Battalion sent nine tanks to raid Agok.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var24&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[company (military)|companies]] of Chinese forces ambushed and devastated a patrol from the 179th Infantry a short time later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var24&quot;/&gt; In the spring, the division launched Operation Counter, which was an effort to establish 11 patrol bases around [[Old Baldy Hill]]. The division then defended the hill against a series of Chinese assaults from the [[38th Army (People's Republic of China)|Chinese 38th Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Var24&quot;/&gt;

==== Final engagements and the end of the war ====
[[File:Old Baldy Area.gif|thumb|left|Map of the area surrounding Old Baldy Hill, which the division defended for much of its tour in Korea.|alt=A topographic map showing a series of hills surrounded by defensive perimeters.]]
The 45th Infantry Division, along with the 7th Infantry Division, fought off repeated Chinese attacks all along the front line throughout 1952, and Chinese forces frequently attacked Old Baldy Hill into the fall of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, the 45th Infantry Division relinquished command of Old Baldy Hill to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]]. Almost immediately the Chinese launched a concentrated attack on the hill, overrunning the U.S. forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy rainstorms prevented the divisions from retaking the hill for around a month, and when it was finally retaken it was heavily fortified to prevent further attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 245th Tank Battalion was sent to assault Chinese positions throughout late 1952, but most of the division held a stationary defensive line against the Chinese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var25&quot;/&gt;

In early 1953, North Korean forces launched a large-scale attack against Hill 812, which was then under the control of K Company, 3rd Battalion, 179th Infantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing [[Battle of Hill Eerie]] was one of a series of larger attacks by Chinese and North Korean forces which produced heavier fighting than the previous year had seen. These offensives were conducted largely in order to secure a better position during the ongoing truce negotiations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var28&quot;/&gt; Chinese forces continued to mount concentrated attacks on the lines of the UN forces, including the 45th Infantry Division, but the division managed to hold most of its ground, remaining stationary until the end of the war in the summer of 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Korean War the 45th Infantry Division suffered 4,004 casualties, consisting of 834 killed in action and 3,170 wounded in action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var102&quot;/&gt; The division was awarded four campaign streamers and one Presidential Unit Citation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|p=666}}&lt;/ref&gt; One soldier from the division, [[Charles George]], was awarded the Medal of Honor while serving in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Korea===
[[File:45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team farewell ceremony Feb 2011.jpg|thumb|alt=A stadium full of soldiers sits behind a podium of commanders in military uniform|Soldiers of the [[45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]], the successor organization to the 45th Infantry Division, hold a ceremony ahead of a deployment to [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in February 2011.]]
The division briefly patrolled the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] following the signing of the armistice ending the war, but most of its men returned home and reverted to National Guard status on 30 April 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson665&quot;/&gt; Its colors were returned to Oklahoma on 25 September of that year, formally ending the division's presence in Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Don122&quot;/&gt;

The division remained as a unit of the Oklahoma National Guard, and participated in no major actions throughout the rest of the 1950s save regular weekend and summer training exercises. In 1963, the formation was reorganized in accordance with the [[Reorganization Objective Army Divisions]] plan, which saw the establishment of a 1st, 2nd and 3rd Brigade within the division. These brigades would see no major deployments or events, and were deactivated five years later in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGrath|2004|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, due to the perceived lack of need for so many large formations in the Army National Guard, the 45th Infantry Division was deactivated, as part of a larger move to reduce the number of Army National Guard divisions from 15 to eight, while increasing the number of separate brigades from seven to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2001|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, the independent [[45th Infantry Brigade (United States)|45th Infantry Brigade (Separate)]] was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson665&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2001|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 45th Infantry Brigade received all of the 45th Division's lineage and heraldry, including its shoulder sleeve insignia.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIOH&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyDUISSICOA/ArmyHeraldryUnit.aspx?u=3671 |title=The Institute of Heraldry: 45th Infantry Brigade |publisher=[[The Institute of Heraldry]] |accessdate=12 June 2012 |location=[[Fort Belvoir, Virginia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also activated from division assets were the [[45th Fires Brigade (United States)|45th Field Artillery Group]], later redesignated the 45th Fires Brigade, and the [[90th Troop Command]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Talley|first=Tim|title=Legislature Honors 45th Infantry Brigade|url=http://www.durantdemocrat.com/view/full_story/1162202/article-Legislature-honors-45th-Infantry-Brigade|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=Durant Democrat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Home At Last—National Guardsmen Return Home|url=http://www.tulsabeacon.com/?p=5899|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=Tulsa Beacon|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
The 45th Infantry Division was awarded eight campaign streamers and one unit award in World War II and four campaign streamers and one unit decoration in the Korean War, for a total of twelve campaign streamers and two unit decorations in its operational history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson663&quot;/&gt;

Note:  Similarity of dates for General Muldrow and commanders beginning with General Ruffner is because 45th Infantry Division, AUS, was retained in Korea while twin unit, 45th Infantry Division, NGUS, was activated in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Guy|title=Thunderbird: A History of the 45th Infantry Division|year=1970|publisher=45th Infantry Division Association|location=Oklahoma City, OK|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
