'''''Conte di Cavour''''' was the [[name ship]] of the three {{sclass-|Conte di Cavour|battleship}}s built for the Royal Italian Navy (''[[Regia Marina]]'') in the 1910s. She served during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], although she was little used and saw no combat during the former. The ship supported operations during the [[Corfu Incident]] in 1923 and spent much of the rest of the decade in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. She was rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before.

Both ''Conte di Cavour'' and her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Italian battleship|Giulio Cesare||2}}, participated in the [[Battle of Calabria]] in July 1940, where the latter was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers [[Battle of Taranto|attacked]] the fleet at [[Taranto]] in November 1940, and ''Conte di Cavour'' was torpedoed. She was deliberately [[Ship grounding|grounded]], with most of her hull underwater, and her repairs were not completed before the [[Italian surrender]] in September 1943. The ship was then captured by the Germans, but they made no use of her. She was damaged in an Allied air raid in early 1945 and [[capsized]] seven days later. ''Conte di Cavour'' was eventually [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1946.

==Description==
''Conte di Cavour'' was {{convert|168.9|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]], and {{convert|176|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]]. The ship had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28|m|ftin|sp=us}}, and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.3|m|ftin|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=randal259&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; She displaced {{convert|23088|LT|t}} at normal load, and {{convert|25086|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. She had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men.&lt;ref name=g02&gt;Giorgerini, pp. 270, 272&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's machinery consisted of four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. Steam for the turbines was provided by 20 Blechynden [[water-tube boiler]]s, eight of which burned [[fuel oil]], and twelve which burned both oil and coal. Designed to reach a maximum speed of {{convert|22.5|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|31000|shp|lk=in}}, ''Conte di Cavour'' failed to reach this goal on her [[sea trial]]s, despite generally exceeding the rated power of her turbines. The ship only made a maximum speed of {{convert|22.2|kn}} using {{convert|31278|shp|abbr=on}}. She had a cruising radius of {{convert|4800|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=randal259/&gt;

The ship was armed with a main battery of thirteen {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} guns in three triple-[[gun turret]] and two twin-gun turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. The secondary battery comprised eighteen {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} guns, all mounted in [[casemate]]s in the sides of the hull. ''Conte di Cavour'' was also armed with fourteen {{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} guns. As was customary for [[capital ship]]s of the period, she was equipped with three submerged {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. She was protected with [[Krupp cemented armour|Krupp cemented steel]] manufactured by [[Terni]]. The [[belt armor]] was {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} thick and the main deck was {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] and main battery turrets were protected with {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on}} worth of armor plating.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgerini, pp. 271–72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modifications and reconstruction==
[[File:ONI Drawing of Conte di Cavour-class battleship.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Office of Naval Intelligence]] drawing of the ''Conte di Cavour'' class, January 1943|alt=A diagram of the external side and top views of the battleship]]
Shortly after the end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76&amp;nbsp;mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter [[Anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]] were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two [[license-built]] [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|2-pounder]] AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s,&lt;ref name=g7&gt;Giorgerini, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; the [[rangefinder]]s were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a [[Macchi M.18]] [[seaplane]] mounted on the center turret. Around that same time she was equipped with a fixed [[aircraft catapult]] on the port side of the forecastle.&lt;ref name=w8&gt;Whitley, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb4&gt;Bagnasco &amp; Grossman, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bargoni &amp; Gay, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

''Conte di Cavour'' began an extensive reconstruction in October 1933 at the CRDA [[Trieste]] shipyard that lasted until June 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bargoni19&quot;&gt;Bargoni &amp; Gay, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; A new bow section was grafted over the existing bow, which increased her length by {{convert|10.31|m|ftin|sp=us}} to {{convert|186.4|m|ftin|sp=us}} and her beam increased to {{convert|28.6|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The ship's draft at deep load increased to {{convert|10.02|m|ftin|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=eb4/&gt; All of the changes made increased her displacement to {{convert|26140|LT|t}} at standard load and {{convert|29100|LT|t}} at deep load. The ship's crew increased to 1,260 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref&gt;Brescia, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the propeller shafts were removed and the existing turbines were replaced by two Belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at {{convert|75000|shp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=eb4/&gt; The boilers were replaced by eight [[Yarrow boiler]]s. In service her maximum speed was about {{convert|27|kn}} and she had a range of {{convert|6400|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|13|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnasco &amp; Grossman, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

The main guns were bored out to {{convert|320|mm|in|sp=us|1}} and the center turret and the torpedo tubes were removed. All of the existing secondary armament and AA guns were replaced by a dozen 120&amp;nbsp;mm guns in six twin-gun turrets and eight {{convert|102|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} AA guns in twin turrets. In addition the ship was fitted with a dozen [[Società Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] [[Cannone-Mitragliera da 37/54 (Breda)|{{convert|37|mm|sp=us|adj=on|1}}]] light AA guns in six twin-gun mounts and twelve {{convert|13.2|mm|sp=us|adj=on|2}} Breda M31 anti-aircraft [[machine gun]]s, also in twin mounts.&lt;ref name=eb5&gt;Bagnasco &amp; Grossman, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 the 13.2&amp;nbsp;mm machine guns were replaced by {{convert|20|mm|sp=us|adj=on|1}} AA guns in twin mounts.&lt;ref name=w8/&gt; The tetrapodal mast was replaced with a new forward conning tower, protected with {{convert|260|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on|1}} thick armor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bargoni21&quot;&gt;Bargoni &amp; Gay, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Atop the conning tower there was a [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control director]] fitted with two large stereo-rangefinders, with a base length of {{convert|7.2|m|sp=us|1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bargoni21&quot;/&gt;

The deck armor was increased during the reconstruction to a total of {{convert|135|mm|in|sp=us}} over the engine and boiler rooms and {{convert|166|mm|in|sp=us}} over the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s, although its distribution over three decks, each with multiple layers, meant that it was considerably less effective than a single plate of the same thickness. The armor protecting the barbettes was reinforced with {{convert|50|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} plates.&lt;ref name=m12/&gt; All this armor weighed a total of {{convert|3227|LT|t}}.&lt;ref name=w8/&gt; The existing underwater protection was replaced by the [[Pugliese torpedo defense system]]; a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo [[warhead]]. It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ship's increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.&lt;ref name=m12&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 421–22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and service==
''Conte di Cavour'', named after the statesman [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour]],&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Keel|laid down]] at [[La Spezia Arsenale]], [[La Spezia]], on 10 August 1910, and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 10 August 1911. She was completed on 1 April 1915, and served as a [[flagship]] in the southern [[Adriatic Sea]] during World War I.&lt;ref name=s7&gt;Preston, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; She saw no action, however, and spent little time at sea.&lt;ref name=g7/&gt; Admiral [[Paolo Thaon di Revel]], the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian [[submarine]]s and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halpern, p. 150&quot;&gt;Halpern, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The threat from these underwater weapons to his [[capital ship]]s was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halpern, p. 150&quot;/&gt; Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as [[MAS (boat)|MAS torpedo boats]], conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 141&amp;ndash;142&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 she sailed to North America and visited ports in the United States as well as [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Canada. The ship was mostly inactive in 1921 because of personnel shortages, and was refitted at La Spezia from November to March 1922. ''Conte di Cavour'' and ''Giulio Cesare'' supported Italian operations on [[Corfu]] in 1923 after an Italian general and his staff [[Corfu incident|were murdered on Corfu]]; [[Benito Mussolini]] was not satisfied with the Greek Government's response, so he ordered Italian troops to occupy the island. ''Conte di Cavour'' bombarded the town with her 76&amp;nbsp;mm guns,&lt;ref name=w1/&gt; killing 20 and wounding 32 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article54795961 |title=Bombardment of Corfu |newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]] |location=Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia |date=1 October 1935 |accessdate=16 March 2013 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; She escorted [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]] and his wife aboard the battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Dante Alighieri||2}} on a state visit to Spain in 1924, and was placed in reserve upon her return until 1926, when she conveyed Mussolini on a voyage to Libya. The ship was again placed in reserve from 1927 until 1933, when she began her reconstruction.&lt;ref name=w1&gt;Whitley, pp. 158–61&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II===
[[File:AerialViewCavour.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of ''Conte di Cavour'' after her reconstruction|alt=A low quality photograph of the battleship in the open seas, taken from above]]
Early in World War II, the ''Conte di Cavour'' and her sister took part in the Battle of Calabria (also known as the Battle of Punto Stilo) on 9 July 1940. They were part of the 1st Battle Squadron, commanded by Admiral [[Inigo Campioni]], during which they engaged major elements of the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]]. The British were escorting a convoy from Malta to [[Alexandria]], while the Italians had finished escorting another from [[Naples]] to [[Benghazi]], Libya. Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, attempted to interpose his ships between the Italians and their base at Taranto. Crews on the fleets spotted each other in the middle of the afternoon and the Italian battleships opened fire at 15:53 at a range of nearly {{convert|29000|yd|disp=flip|sp=us}}. The two leading British battleships, {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} and {{HMS|Malaya||2}}, replied a minute later. Three minutes after she opened fire, shells from ''Giulio Cesare'' began to straddle ''Warspite'' which made a small turn and increased speed, to throw off the Italian ship's aim, at 16:00. At that same time, a shell from ''Warspite'' struck ''Giulio Cesare'' at a distance of about {{convert|26000|yd|disp=flip|sp=us}}. Uncertain how severe the damage was, Campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in the face of superior British numbers and they successfully disengaged.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, pp. 28–35&lt;/ref&gt; Repairs to ''Giulio Cesare'' were completed by the end of August and both ships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept British convoys to [[Malta]] in August and September.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 11 November 1940, ''Conte di Cavour'' was at anchor in [[Taranto]] harbor when she was attacked by 21 [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from the British [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Illustrious|R87|6}}, along with several other warships. The ship's gunners shot down one Swordfish shortly after the aircraft dropped its torpedo, but it exploded underneath 'B' turret at 23:15, knocking out the main bow pump. Her captain requested tugboats to help [[Ship grounding|ground]] the ship on a nearby {{convert|12|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} [[sandbank]] at 23:27, but Admiral [[Bruno Brivonesi]], commander of the 5th Battleship Division, vetoed the request until it was too late and ''Conte di Cavour'' had to use a deeper, {{convert|17|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}}, sandbank at 04:45 the following morning. She initially grounded on an even keel, but temporarily took on a 50-degree [[list (watercraft)|list]] before settling to the bottom at 08:00 with a 11.5-degree list. Only her superstructure and gun turrets were above water by this time.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 81–85, 88&lt;/ref&gt;

''Conte di Cavour'' had the lowest priority for [[Marine salvage|salvage]] among the three battleships sunk during the attack and little work was done for several months. The first priority was to patch the holes in the hull and then her guns and parts of her superstructure were removed to lighten the ship. False [[Glossary of nautical terms#Bulwark|bulwarks]] were welded to the upper sides of the hull to prevent water from reentering the hull and pumping the water overboard began in May 1941. Some {{convert|15000|t|LT|sp=us}} of water were pumped out before ''Conte di Cavour'' was refloated on 9 June and entered the ex-Austro-Hungarian [[floating dry dock]] ''GO-12'' on 12 July. The damage was more extensive than originally thought and temporary repairs to enable the ship to reach Trieste for permanent repairs took until 22 December.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 88–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Her guns were operable by September 1942, but replacing her entire electrical system took longer so the navy took advantage of the delays and incorporated some modifications based on lessons learned from the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Other changes planned were the replacement of her secondary and anti-aircraft weapons with a dozen {{convert|135|mm|sp=us|adj=on|1}} [[dual-purpose gun]]s in twin mounts, twelve {{convert|65|mm|sp=us|adj=on|1}}, and twenty-three 20&amp;nbsp;mm AA guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb5&quot;/&gt; The repair work was suspended in June 1943, with an estimated six months work left to do on ''Conte di Cavour'' remaining, in order to expedite the construction of urgently needed smaller ships. She was captured by the Germans on 8 September when Italy surrendered to the Allies, and was reduced to a [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]. She was damaged in an air raid on 17 February 1945, and capsized on 23 February.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Refloated shortly after the end of the war, ''Conte di Cavour'' was scrapped in 1946.&lt;ref name=b9&gt;Brescia, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
