'''Central Flying School''' ('''CFS''') is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) training unit, located at [[RAAF Base East Sale]], Victoria. It operates the [[Pilatus PC-9]] turboprop trainer. The school is responsible for training flight instructors, setting flying standards, and auditing flying practices. It is also home to the &quot;[[Roulettes]]&quot; aerobatic team. CFS was the first military aviation unit to be formed in Australia, in 1913, when its role was to provide basic flying training. Its current form dates from World War&amp;nbsp;II, when it was re-established to train flying instructors for the [[Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS).

CFS was inaugurated at [[RAAF Williams|Point Cook]], Victoria, in March 1913, and trained over 150 pilots of the [[Australian Flying Corps]] during World War&amp;nbsp;I. It was disbanded in December 1919, and the newly formed RAAF's [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] took on its function in 1921. Re-formed under EATS at Point Cook in April 1940, CFS relocated to [[New South Wales]] the following month, based first at [[Camden Airport (Sydney)|Camden]], then at [[Tamworth Airport|Tamworth]] from April 1942, and finally at [[RAAF Station Parkes|Parkes]] from January 1944. It returned to Point Cook in September 1944. By the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II, the school had produced more than 3,600 instructors. It transferred to East Sale in November 1947.

Since 1962, CFS has been responsible for three aerobatic display teams. The first, &quot;The Red Sales&quot;, flew [[De Havilland Vampire]] jet aircraft. A second team, &quot;The Telstars&quot;, was formed in 1963, also flying Vampires. The Telstars disbanded in 1968, just after taking delivery of new [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi MB326H]] jets, when the RAAF curtailed display flying. The Roulettes formed in 1970, flying the Macchi, and continued to operate the type until 1990, when the team finished converting to the PC-9. As well as the Roulettes, CFS is responsible for the display work of the Air Force Balloons.

In December 1911, the Australian [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] advertised in the United Kingdom for &quot;two competent mechanists and aviators&quot; to establish a flying corps and school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.2-4&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.710-711&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/33.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp. 710–711]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Henry Petre]], an Englishman, and [[Eric Harrison (RAAF officer)|Eric Harrison]], an Australian, were selected and commissioned as [[lieutenant]]s in the [[Australian Military Forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.2-4&quot;/&gt; Petre arrived in Australia in January 1913; his first job was to choose a site for the proposed Central Flying School (CFS), which he was to command. Rejecting the government's preferred location near the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in [[Canberra]], he selected 297 [[hectare]]s at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, to become, as [[George Odgers]] described it, the &quot;birthplace of Australian military aviation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.2-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air Force Australia'', pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Petre and Harrison established CFS over the following year with four mechanics, three other staff, and five aircraft including two Deperdussin monoplanes, two [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]] biplanes, and a [[Bristol Boxkite]] for initial training. Harrison made the unit's first flight in the Boxkite on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1914, while Petre, flying a Deperdussin later that day, registered its first accident when he crashed after snaring his tailplane in telephone wires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Force News&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Wellfare | first = John | title = Alone in the dark |magazine= Air Force News | publisher = [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] | location = Canberra| date = 21 April 2005 | url = http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4706/features/feature01.htm | accessdate = 2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its coterie of personnel by now referred to as the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC), CFS commenced its first flying course on 17&amp;nbsp;August 1914, two weeks after the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;I. The four students included [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] [[Thomas White (Australian politician)|Thomas White]] and Lieutenants [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], George Merz, and David Manwell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.2-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Force News&quot;/&gt; Williams, who became the first to graduate, recalled the school as a &quot;ragtime show&quot; consisting of a paddock, tents, and one large structure: a shed for the Boxkite.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 8–10&lt;/ref&gt;

A further eleven courses were run during the war years, graduating 152 pilots to a basic flying standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 137–139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens5&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 5–9&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these students would go on to play a prominent role in the future [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), including [[William Anderson (RAAF officer)|Bill Anderson]], [[Harry Cobby]], [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]], [[Frank McNamara (VC)|Frank McNamara]], [[Lawrence Wackett]], and [[Henry Wrigley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens5&quot;/&gt; The AFC's first unit to see active service, the [[Mesopotamian Half Flight]], was raised under Petre's command and departed for the Middle East in April 1915; Petre's fellow pilots included CFS graduates White and Merz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack pp.1-3&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/01.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 1–3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 4–9&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison took over the school's leadership in Petre's absence. The facilities were improved, and by the end of 1915, according to Wackett, they boasted &quot;a good engineering workshop&quot;, &quot;cottages for the married staff&quot; and &quot;a very comfortable officers mess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, three AFC squadrons had been formed at Point Cook for service in the Middle East and France: [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;1]], [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|3]] and [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|4 Squadrons]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 9, 16&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1918 the school, now made up of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Home Training Squadron, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Home Training Depot, and an aircraft repair section, became part of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark12&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison was posted overseas in October and [[Major]] William Sheldon, former commanding officer of Nos. 2 and 4 Squadrons, was placed in charge of CFS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1067810/RCDIG1067810--196-.JPG|title=First World War Embarkation Roll&amp;nbsp;– Eric Harrison|publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Little training took place in the year following the November 1918 [[Armistice]]; staff mainly did &quot;odd jobs&quot; such as making survey flights and promoting [[government bonds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark12&quot;/&gt; CFS's units were disbanded in December 1919 and the school taken over by the short-lived Australian Air Corps, formed on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, CFS's function was assumed by [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS), a unit of the newly formed RAAF.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark41&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens29,67-68&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 29, 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

RAAF flying training was heavily reorganised soon after the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II in response to Australia's participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS). Elementary Flying Training Schools were formed, to provide basic flight instruction to cadets, while more advanced pilot instruction was to take place at Service Flying Training Schools.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/03.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp. 72–73]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.97&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt; The most pressing need, however, was for flying instructors; the RAAF had only sixteen, and at least 1,000 were needed to meet Australia's obligations under EATS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens29,67-68&quot;/&gt; To train these instructors, the Instructors' Training Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS was detached to form the nucleus of a new Central Flying School on 29&amp;nbsp;April 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens29,67-68&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.97&quot;/&gt; Described as the &quot;nerve-centre of the Empire Air Training Scheme in Australia&quot;, it was commanded by [[Squadron Leader]] E.C.

Later that year, CFS moved once more, returning on 19&amp;nbsp;September to Point Cook.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; There it gained an aviation medicine section, which in 1956 was detached to form the RAAF School of Aviation Medicine (later the RAAF Institute of Aviation Medicine).&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/exhibitions/special.htm |title=Past Exhibitions&amp;nbsp;– Safety Through Knowledge: 50 Years of RAAF Aviation Medicine|publisher= [[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CFS remained at Point Cook for the rest of the war, by which time it had graduated some 3,600 instructors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt;

The immediate aftermath of the Pacific War saw large-sale [[demobilisation]] of RAAF personnel, along with the disposal of equipment and disbandment of units. CFS was allocated resources to ensure the maintenance of Air Force flying standards, but took on no new students.&lt;ref&gt;Mordike, ''The Post-War Years'', pp. 5, 10&lt;/ref&gt; The school relocated from Point Cook to RAAF Station East Sale (now [[RAAF Base East Sale]]), Victoria, during November and December 1947; its aircraft included seven Tiger Moths, nine Wirraways, three Oxfords, two [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakotas]], one [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]], and one [[Avro Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; It then returned to the job of training instructors, graduating its first post-war course in June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers reporting on its move to East Sale called CFS the RAAF's &quot;university of the air&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22526515 |title=&quot;Air university&quot; moves to Sale |newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=6 December 1947 |accessdate=2 January 2016 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article79814454 |title=RAAF 'university' |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]] |location=Perth |date=9 December 1947 |accessdate=2 January 2016 |page=8, Home Edition |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official RAAF historian Alan Stephens described the school as &quot;the Air Force's most important peacetime unit&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; going on to state that &quot;CFS's pre-eminence derived from its role as the Air Force's arbiter of pure flying standards, a responsibility it met by training instructors, examining and rating squadron instructors, conducting quality control tests at flying training schools, and auditing flying practices generally across the RAAF.

Meldrum, joined an RAAF team charged with selecting a jet trainer to replace both the Winjeel and the Vampire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Led by [[Air Commodore]] [[Brian Eaton]], the team chose the Italian [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi MB-326H]] as it met all requirements, could be licence-built by the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] in Australia, and was relatively inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 161–163&lt;/ref&gt; The Telstars began flying the Macchi in February 1968, but the RAAF cut back on display flying shortly afterwards, and the team disbanded in April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Museum&quot;/&gt; A new aerobatic team flying Macchis, the &quot;[[Roulettes]]&quot;, was formed at CFS in August 1970, in preparation for the RAAF's fiftieth anniversary celebrations commencing in March 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roulettes&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Curran|first=Aaron|title=Roulettes roll out for 40th anniversary |magazine=Defence Magazine|issue= 7|date =2010|publisher=Department of Defence |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/defencemagazine/editions/2010_07/mag.pdf|pages=16–17|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the Macchi permitted a brief flirtation with &quot;all-through jet training&quot; starting in 1969, as it was expected to reduce the time necessary to turn out high-quality pilots, and CFS had begun preparing to train instructors for this purpose in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens199&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; All-through jet training was dropped in 1971, subsequently being labelled &quot;an expensive way of finding out that some pupils lacked the aptitude to become military pilots&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens199&quot;/&gt; Winjeels continued to operate at CFS until replaced by the [[PAC CT/4 Airtrainer|CT-4 Airtrainer]] in August 1975. For the next fifteen years, the main types used for instructor training were the CT-4 and the Macchi. CFS also flew Dakotas for twin-engined instructor courses until March 1980; they were further used to train pilots of the [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force]]. The school was presented with the [[Queen's Colour]] by Governor-General [[Zelman Cowen|Sir Zelman Cowen]] in September 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; In December 1987, CFS took delivery of its first [[Pilatus PC-9]] turboprop trainer, to replace the Macchi for advanced flying instructor training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series3/A23.htm|title= Pilatus PC-9/A|publisher= RAAF Museum|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roulettes converted to the PC-9 in 1989–90.&lt;ref name=&quot;Museum&quot;/&gt; The CT-4 was phased out at the school in favour of the PC-9 in December 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt;
