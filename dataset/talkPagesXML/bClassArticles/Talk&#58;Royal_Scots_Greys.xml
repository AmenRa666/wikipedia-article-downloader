Should there be a separate [[Royal Scots]] page?  [[User:duncharris]]

:Yes, it's an entirely different regiment. The Royal Scots are an infantry regiment; the Royal Scots Greys were a cavalry regiment. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] 14:34, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)

==Motto==

&quot;The Scots Greys had the motto &quot;Second to none&quot;. It referred to their seniority in the British Army and their fighting prowess. &quot; That is they claimed to be the oldest 
Dragoon Regiment in the British Army. I thought that the the Motto of the Royal Scots Dragoons Guards  &quot;Nemo Me Impune Lacessit (No one provokes me with impunity).&quot; and &quot;Second to none&quot; comes from two diffrent regements which amalgameted: the 3rd Carabiniers  supplied the &quot;Nemo...&quot; and the Scots Greys supplied the &quot;second...&quot; So unless this is incorrect I would like to revert the moto sentence to the previous version. [[User:Philip Baird Shearer|Philip Baird Shearer]] 14:14, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:According to ''Brassey's Companion to the British Army'', the motto of the 2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys) was ''Nemo Me Impune Lacessit''. It is the motto of the Order of the Thistle, so it is unlikely to have been the motto of the 3rd Carabiniers, which wasn't a Scottish regiment. [http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/cav/D02rsg.htm www.regiments.org] gives both mottoes for the Scots Greys. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] 14:31, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Ewart ==

The article refers to &quot;Sergeant Ewart&quot; - wasn't he an ensign? Certainly this is how he's generally referred to, and it's what they named the pub... [[User:Shimgray|Shimgray]] | [[User talk:Shimgray|talk]] | 13:54, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
:I think he was commissioned for his gallantry, but was a sergeant at the time. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] 15:53, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

==Surrendered in their thousands?==

I think its safe to debunk that. Most captures occurred nearing the end of the battle weren't they? [[User:AllStarZ|AllStarZ]] 22:57, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

== Some Inaccuracies ==

&quot;Wearing bearskins, they were distinguished as the only heavy cavalry regiment not to wear helmets.&quot;

This is only true after 1812-13, before that they were the only heavy cavalry regiment not to wear cocked hats.

Would it not be better to say they were the only British cavalry regiment to wear bearskins?  The fur headgear worn by hussars were called kolpaks, later 'busbys,' not bearskins.

The Greys were part of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, also called the &quot;Union Brigade,&quot; with the 1st Dragoons &quot;Royals&quot; and the 6th Dragoons &quot;Iniskillings&quot; - the whole brigade was led by Ponsonby, the Grey's commander was Colonel Inglis Hamilton.  

The counter charge at Waterloo which caught the British heavies was made by cuirassiers (Travers' brigade) and the lancers of Jaquinot's brigade, who were French not Polish and not Imperial Guard.

Uxbridge claimed the charge of the heavies against D'Erlon's corps took 3,000 prisoners, 2,000 is a generally accepted estimate.

The Greys were reformed into two squadrons after their first charge and engaged French cavalry later in the battle.  An officer of the 3rd KGL Hussars says that the Greys formed up with his regiment late in the engagement and were involved in exchanging carbine fire with French cavalry, which the Greys suffered from more than his own regiment as they made bigger targets.

== Needs copyedit? ==

I'm trying to decipher whether the article has suffered from subtle vandalism or needs to be run through comprehensive copyedit.

Many sentences feel convoluted and are missing words over the article.
