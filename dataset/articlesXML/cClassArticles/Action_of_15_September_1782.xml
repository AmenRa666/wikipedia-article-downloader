The '''Action of 15 September 1782''' was a naval action in the mouth of the [[Delaware Bay]] in which four [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] vessels under the command of the [[George Elphinstone]] pursued and attacked three French warships which included two frigates which was under the command of [[Louis-René Levassor de Latouche Tréville|Comte De la Touche Tréville]]. The French [[French frigate Aigle (1782)|38 gun frigate ''Aigle'']] was grounded and captured along with the Comte De la Touche.

==Background==

In early 1782, Captain [[Louis-René Levassor de Latouche Tréville|Latouche-Tréville]] assumed command of ''Aigle'', which, along with the frigate ''Gloire'', ferried funds and equipment for the fleet of Admiral [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Vaudreil]]. On 5 September 1782 ''Aigle'' and ''Gloire'' encountered the recently acquired British ship [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], a former French ship of the line which had been severely damaged and then captured at the [[Battle of the Saintes]]. ''Hector'' managed to escape but she was damaged further and later sank in the [[1782 Central Atlantic hurricane]].  ''Aigle'' and ''Gloire'' went on to capture the brig {{HMS|Racoon|1780|6}} off the [[Delaware River]] on 10 September 1782. On 13 September a small British squadron consisting of {{HMS|Vestal|1779|6}}, {{HMS|Bonetta|1779|6}}, and the prize ''Sophie'', led by Captain [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|George Elphinstone]] in {{HMS|Warwick|1767|6}}, and [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']] sighted the three vessels anchored in the [[Delaware River]] off [[Cape Henlopen Light]]. The British set out in chase; Captain George Elphinstone, in the 50-gun ship ''Warwick'' dispatched the lighter vessels 28-gun frigate ''Vestal'', the sloop ''Bonetta'' and the ''Sophie'' under command of [[Richard Keats]] as they were to traverse shallow waters.

==Action==

''Aigle'' and ''Gloire'' were soon hotly pursued into the Delaware by three Royal navy vessels. The French were able to navigate the sandbanks with the help of ''Racoon{{'}}''s pilot, who agreed to help the French for a payment of 500 [[Louis d'or]]. The ''Gloire'' succeeded in getting so far up the river that she could not be attacked with any prospect of success, the British ships had to traverse the shallows having no pilot on board. &lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=12388|startpage=3|endpage=4|date=12 November 1782}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aigle'' which now had most of ''Racoon's'' crew was soon grounded while the ''Vestal'' and ''Bonetta'', drawing less water, were dispatched to attack the French frigate. The ''Vestal'' ran aground on the starboard quarter of the ''Aigle'', the ''Bonetta'' anchoring within 200 yards of her larboard quarter, while the ''Sophie'' anchored under her stern. La Touche had cut away her masts in an attempt to lighten her, and when that failed, had had holes bored in her hull. The ships were so judiciously placed, that ''Aigle'' was unable to bring a gun to bear on them, and, after receiving a few broadsides. La Touche stayed with the ship and seeing any further resistance was useless so [[striking the colours|struck her colours]]. ''Gloire'' and ''Racoon'' managed to escape.

==Aftermath==

The British captured along with the ''Aigle'' all of ''Racoon{{'}}''s crew. ''Aigle'' had had on board some senior French officers, who escaped ashore, as did the now-wealthy pilot. The French officers who escaped included [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|comte de Rochambeau]] (commander of the French army), vicomte de Laval, Duke Laurun, Viscount de Fleury, and some others. They took most of the treasure the ships were carrying, as well.&lt;ref&gt;The Remembrancer, Or Impartial Repository of Public Events, Volume 14 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pD0ZAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA378&amp;lpg=PA378&amp;dq=included+two+of+1782+l'aigle+600+surrendered&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KdL7C1O1xW&amp;sig=cPgsoDq-0NDJxs2JG_kP7xAVJjs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L0CtUNKtOYPX0QXS4oDgBg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=included%20two%20of%201782%20l'aigle%20600%20surrendered&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

British were able to re-float ''Aigle'' and took her into service as HMS ''Aigle'' . Comte La Touche, along with several noblemen that included two of [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|marquis de Lafayette's]] family, as well 600 sailors and troops were captured by the crew of the Royal naval vessels, helped by a number of British troops who had arrived very late in the action. Comte De la Touche Tréville remained a prisoner for the rest of the war's duration.
