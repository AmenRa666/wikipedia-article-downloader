'''RMS ''Majestic''''' was a steamship built in 1890 for and operated by the [[White Star Line]].

==History==
A product of [[Harland and Wolff]], the ''Majestic'' was launched  on 29 June 1889. The ship spent the next nine months being fitted out for delivery to White Star in March, 1890. White Star had sought to fund the construction of both the ''Majestic'' and {{SS|Teutonic|1889|2}}.  Through the British government, a proposal which was accepted, with the stipulation that the Royal Navy would have access to the two liners in a time of war.

On 2 April 1890, ''Majestic'' left on her maiden voyage from [[Liverpool]] to [[New York City]]. There was a strong desire in the White Star management to regain the coveted [[Blue Riband]], the award for the fastest crossing of the [[Atlantic]]. The maiden voyage did not produce a time good enough to win the Blue Riband away from {{SS|City of Paris|1888|2}}, but on a west-bound voyage between 30 July and 5 August 1891, she achieved that goal, with an average speed of 20.1 [[Knot (unit)|knots]]. Unfortunately, the ''Majestic'' held the honour for a mere two weeks, as the ''Teutonic'' completed a crossing on 19 August with a speed of 20.35 knots (the ''City of Paris'' then won it back a year later).

In 1895, the ''Majestic'' was assigned a new captain named [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward Smith]], later notable as the captain of the ''Titanic''. Smith served as ''Majestic's'' captain for nine years. When the Boer War started in 1899, Smith and the ''Majestic'' were called upon to transport troops to [[Cape Colony]]. Two trips were made to [[South Africa]], one in December, 1899 and one in February, 1900, both without incident. 

In 1902–1903, the ship underwent a refit, which included new boilers (and consequently taller twin funnels), after which she returned to the Liverpool-New York run. Smith left as captain in 1904 to take on the new [[RMS Baltic (1903)|''Baltic'']], then the largest ship in the world. In 1905, the ''Majestic'' suffered a fire in her bunker, but the damage was not significant. In 1907, White Star's main terminal was moved from Liverpool to [[Southampton]] and, on 26 June, the ''Majestic'' sailed from these new facilities for the first time. 

When the {{RMS|Olympic|3=2}} entered service in 1911, ''Teutonic'' was removed from the New York run and put on Canadian service with the Dominion Line. Likewise when ''Titanic'' came on the scene in 1912, ''Majestic'' was retired from White Star's New York service and designated as a reserve ship, biding her time at [[Birkenhead]]'s Bidston Dock. When the ''Titanic'' met her fate in April, 1912, ''Majestic'' was pressed back into service, filling the hole in the transatlantic schedule. 

On 17 October 1913, she came to the rescue of the French [[schooner]] ''Garonne'', which had wrecked. 14 January 1914 saw the ''Majestic'' leave for her last Atlantic crossing. Soon after, she was sold for £26,700 for scrap to the [[Thos W Ward]] yard at [[Morecambe]]. Before scrapping of the ship commenced the scrapping company opened the ship for public tours, and some of the still-beautiful interior panelling was saved and used in the offices of the Ward company.
