The '''Cyprus Naval Command''' ({{lang-el|Ναυτική Διοίκηση Κύπρου}}, {{lang-tr|Kıbrıs Deniz Kuvvetleri}}) (also known as the '''Cyprus Navy''' or '''Cypriot Navy''') is the armed sea wing of the [[Cyprus National Guard]]. This force does not possess any [[capital ship]]s or other major warships, but is equipped with [[patrol boat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;• Table 23, Republic of Cyprus: Major National Guard Equipment, 1990, Library of Congress (Additional sourcing: Based on information from The Military Balance, 1989- 1990, London, 1989, 85; and Christopher F. Foss, &quot;Cypriot Rearmament Completed,&quot; Jane's Defence Weekly [London], 12 March 1988, 445.)&lt;/ref&gt; landing craft, surface-to-surface [[missile]] systems and integrated [[radar]] systems, as well as SEALs-type naval underwater demolitions units. The Cyprus Navy has the primary mission of defending the sea [[borders]] of the [[Republic of Cyprus]], but is currently unable to access waters around [[Northern Cyprus]] which are controlled by the [[Turkish Navy]] since the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|1974 conflict]].

==History==

===Combat actions of 1964===
{{main|Battle of Tylliria}}
On 6 August 1964, [[Cyprus National Guard]] forces commenced combat action against the [[Turkish Cypriot]] enclave of [[Kokkina]], in the north-west of Cyprus. This operation was regarded by both [[Cyprus]] and [[Greece]] as a necessary [[interdiction]] against a threat by Turkish Cypriot [[militia]], who were using Kokkina as a [[beachhead]] by which to land supplies and weapons shipped from Turkey. The Cyprus National Guard forces were under the command of General [[George Grivas]], with the blessing of Athens. A combined land and sea attack was launched against Kokkina using two Cyprus Navy R-151 Group [[patrol boat]]s, the ''[[Phaethon (patrol boat)|Phaethon]]'' (''commander - Second Leuthenant Dimitrios Mitsatsos'') and the ''Arion'', manned by Greek navy personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enkripto.com/2009/06/64.html / Unknown bombardment of Patrol boat &quot;Phaethon&quot; in Cyprus 1964], in Greek&lt;/ref&gt; Firing 40mm and 20mm shells, the two patrol boats bombarded the enclave for a period of time, in conjunction with land-based 25-pounder [[artillery]].&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;Cyprus, 1955-1973 By Tom Cooper, www.acig.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle was well underway on 8 August, when the [[Turkish Air Force]] commenced its own attack with [[fighter aircraft]], making numerous strafing passes of Greek Cypriot positions. The vessel ''Phaethon'' was struck by rocket fire and burst into flames, forcing the crew to deliberately run it aground near Xeros Harbour.  Seven of the crewmembers on ''Phaethon'' were killed and several wounded in the attack, and the ship was unsalvagable and later stricken.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyprus 100 Years Alex Efthyvoulou, Laiki Cultural Bank Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

The second R-151 Group patrol boat, ''Arion'', was attacked by the same Turkish fighter jet formations, and was reportedly struck several times by strafing fire, but escaped to Paphos. During the attack on the ''Arion'', a Turkish [[F-100 Super Sabre]], piloted by Captain [[Cengiz Topel]], was struck by 40mm anti-aircraft fire and shot down. The pilot ejected over land but was promptly captured and lynched by members of the Cyprus National Guard.

===Combat actions of 1974===
{{main|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}
On 15 July 1974, [[EOKA-B]] and elements of the [[Cyprus National Guard]] overthrew the legitimate President, [[Archbishop Makarios]] and replaced him with [[Nikos Sampson]]. Makarios escaped an initial attempt to capture him at the Archbishiporic in [[Nicosia]], and fled to [[Paphos]]. A naval patrol vessel, ''Leventis'' (pennant number 15) was quickly dispatched to Paphos to begin shelling a radio station there which was being operated by pro-Makarios elements.&lt;ref name=Drousiotis&gt;Cyprus 1974 - The Greek coup and the Turkish invasion, Makarios Drousiotis, Hellenic Distribution Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus in a surprise-attack, without issuing a [[declaration of war]]. A naval force of Turkish vessels was detected by coastal radar at Apostolos Andreas approaching the coast, and a second force of naval vessels was sighted off the coast of Kyrenia during the early hours. The Cyprus National Guard Naval Command quickly ordered its two [[motor torpedo boats]], ''T-1'' (''commander - Lieutenant Junior Grade Nicolaos Verikios'') and ''T-3'' (''commander - Lieutenant Elefterios Tsomakis''), (based at [[Kyrenia]]) to attack the Turkish flotilla directly. Both vessels were promptly sunk by combined air and sea attack.&lt;ref name=Drousiotis /&gt; The rest of the Cyprus Navy vessels were sunk by their own crews at Naval base &quot;Chrysulis&quot; in Boghazi (14.08.1974). After the conflict, two boats were refloated by Turkish troops and transferred to Golcuk Naval Museum, Turkey (on display with pennant numbers 11 and 12).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turkishnavy.info/thumbnails.php?album=12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments from 1975 to 2008===
In 1983, the [[Navy]] acquired a single Type 32L Esterel fast patrol craft from France.&lt;ref&gt;Jane's Fighting Ships 2004-2005; ISBN 0-7106-2623-1; p.167&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel has been upgraded, and has heavy [[armament]], including two 2-round Mistral-SIMBAD air-defence missile launchers, 1 40mm .70cal OTO-Breda-Bofors AA cannon and 1 20mm .90cal Rheinmetall AA cannon.&lt;ref name=Wertheim&gt;The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World: Their Ships, Aircraft, and Systems By Eric Wertheim Published by Naval Institute Press, 2007 ISBN 1-59114-955-X, 9781591149552&lt;/ref&gt; Later (circa 2006-2008) 40mm .70cal OTO-Breda-Bofors AA cannon was replaced by 20mm .70cal Oerlikon Mk10 AA cannon.

In 1994, [[Cyprus]] acquired 24 Aerospatiale MM40 Exocet Block-II anti-ship missiles (reportedly initially intended for Iran) from [[France]], along with 3 coastal defence batteries.&lt;ref name=Wertheim /&gt;

In 2000, the Cyprus Navy received the ex-[[Hellenic Navy]] patrol boat &quot;''Knossos''&quot;, which was renamed &quot;''Kyrenia''&quot;, designated ''P02'' and formed the ''Kyrenia'' class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&amp;folder=296&amp;article=5639&amp;hilite=tsohatzopoulos / Greek Embassy Website]&lt;/ref&gt; This vessel was Greek made, of the Dilos-class, previously designated P269. This vessel is armed with one single 20mm .70cal Oerlikon Mk10 AA cannon and one 2-round Mistral-SIMBAD air-defence missile launcher.&lt;ref name=Wertheim /&gt;

In 2002, the Cyprus Navy acquired two Rodman 55 fast assault boats for the purpose of serving her [[Special Forces]] units. These fast craft are named &quot;Agathos&quot; and &quot;Panagos&quot;.&lt;ref name=Wertheim /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original research from photos posted on www.militaryphotos.net, accessed 07/12/08&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2004-2006, Cyprus took delivery of four FPB 30M type fast [[patrol]] craft from [[manufacturer]] Cantierre Navale Vittoria of Italy, of which two were intended for the Navy, and two intended for the Marine Police.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vittoria.biz/en/c382.php&lt;/ref&gt; These vessels were fitted with single 25mm .80cal KBA OTO-Melara automatic cannons and two single 12.7mm machine guns, equipped with radars and Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIRs). The Navy pair were issued the pennant numbers ''P03'' and ''P04''.

==2011 Base Disaster and Naval Reconstruction==

On 11 July 2011, the [[Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion]] resulted in the destruction of much of the infrastructure of the nation's main naval port and loss of the Commander of Cypriot Navy Captain [[Andreas Ioannides (naval officer)|Andreas Ioannides]]. Reconstruction began immediately on the strength of domestic contracts for buildings and structures.

==2013 Reported Acquisition of New Warships==

Following various media reports in 2012 that Cyprus was entertaining offers by Israel and Greece to supply two heavy Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs), being far larger and more capable than anything previously operated, it was extensively reported in January 2013 that Cyprus has signed an agreement with France to purchase two large, stealthy and well-armed vessels based upon the GOWIND corvette design. This frenzy of media speculation was bolstered by the otherwise sudden and unexplained visit to Cyprus by the L'Adroit, which some sources interpreted as a demonstration of the ship design, to be held at Limassol port from 24 to 26 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/french-navy-ship-due-thursday/20130122. Accessed 15/02/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Further unconfirmed reports by the Cyprus media claim to have it on good authority that a $120 million USD down payment for the vessels is factored into the 2013 fiscal budget,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sigmalive.com/news/local/26401. Accessed 15/02/2013&lt;/ref&gt; justified against the financial crisis by emergency defense requirements.
