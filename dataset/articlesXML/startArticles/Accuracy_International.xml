'''Accuracy International''' is a specialist British [[firearm]]s manufacturer based in [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]], England, and best known for producing the [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare]] series of precision [[sniper]] [[rifle]]s.  The company was established in 1978 by British [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] shooting gold medallist [[Malcolm Cooper]], [[MBE]] (1947–2001), Sarah Cooper, Martin Kay, and the designers of the weapons, Dave Walls and Dave Caig.  All were highly skilled international or national [[target shooting|target shooters]].  Accuracy International's high-accuracy [[sniper rifle]]s are in use with many military units and police departments around the world.

Accuracy International went into liquidation in 2005, and was bought by a British consortium including the original design team of Dave Walls and Dave Caig.

== Management ==

The company is currently (2014) equally owned by two directors, Dave Walls and Tom Irwin along with Paul Bagshaw. Dave Caig remains in the business as a consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.accuracyinternational.com/about_us.php | title=No place for second best | publisher=Accuracy International | accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

The Accuracy International rifle system has gained success, due in part to the design considerations put into the overall rifle.  The rifles are hand-built.  The [[Accuracy International AWM|AWSM]] (Arctic Warfare Super Magnum) set the world record for the [[Longest recorded sniper kills|longest confirmed combat kill]].

The rifle stock design is designed for good [[ergonomics]].  The comfort in holding the rifle and the reduced recoil aids accuracy.

The [[gun barrel|barrel]] is interchangeable with other calibres; this can be done in the field in about 15 minutes.  With the barrel clamped in a barrel vice, the barrel is removed from the [[Firearm action|action]], and another one screwed into the action and tightened in place with a torque wrench. Newer versions of Accuracy International rifles including the AX, AT (Accuracy Tactical), and AXMC (AX Multi-Calibre) feature a switch-barrel system that allow the user to change out the barrel with only the use of a 4mm hex wrench, allowing field barrel changes in under a minute.

The inherent accuracy of the rifle is due to the [[Firearm action|action]] being bolted with four screws and permanently bonded with epoxy material to an aluminium [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]], to which all major rifle components are in turn attached.  As it keeps the action from moving away from zero (determined by the alignment of the scope to the rifle bore rather than the alignment of the action to the stock) the accuracy of the rifle is very high.  Adding a folding [[Stock (firearm)|stock]] handle, this sniper rifle can be used for both [[HALO jump|HALO]] insertions and walking deployments of sniper forces.

Due to the success of the chassis system in Accuracy International-manufactured rifles, Accuracy International has developed the AICS (Accuracy International Chassis System) for several popular varieties of barreled rifle actions, including the Savage M10 and Remington 700 short and long actions, both of which have long histories and good reputations for accuracy and precision in stock, out-of-the box form.

Accuracy International introduced their new [[Accuracy International AS50|AS50]] [[.50 BMG]] calibre [[semi-automatic rifle]] at the 2005 [[SHOT Show]] in Las Vegas and their new AX Series at the 2010 Shot Show in Las Vegas.

The UK government announced in March 2008 the award of an £11 million contract to produce rifles for the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sky.com/story/587146/british-rifle-can-hit-target-a-mile-away | title=British Rifle Can Hit Target A Mile Away | publisher=Sky News | date=2008-03-07 | accessdate=2013-06-03 | author=Meade, Geoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
