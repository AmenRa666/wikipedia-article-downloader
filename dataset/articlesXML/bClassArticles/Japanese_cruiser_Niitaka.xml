{{nihongo|'''''Niitaka'''''|新高}} was the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass-|Niitaka|cruiser|0}} [[protected cruiser]]s of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. She was the [[sister ship]] of the {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tsushima||2}}. ''Niitaka'' was named after [[Yushan (mountain)|Mount Niitaka]] in [[Taiwan]], at the time, the tallest mountain in the [[Japanese Empire]].

==Background==
The ''Niitaka''-class cruisers were ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy under its 2nd Emergency Expansion Program, with a budget partly funded by the [[War reparations|war indemnity]] received from the [[Qing dynasty|Empire of China]] as part of the settlement of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] ending the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. The class was intended for high speed reconnaissance missions. ''Niitaka'' was built at the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]], with the keel laid down on 7 January 1902 and launching on 15 November 1902.

==Design==
In terms of design, ''Niitaka'' was very conservative in layout and similar to, but somewhat larger than the earlier Japanese-designed {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Suma||2}}. The increased displacement, heavier armor and lower [[center of gravity]] resulted in a more seaworthy and powerful vessel than ''Suma'', and enabled ''Niitaka'' to outclass many other contemporary protected cruisers.&lt;ref name=Conway&gt;Chesneau, ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860–1905'', page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of armament, it is noteworthy that ''Niitaka'' was not equipped with [[torpedo]]es. Observing problems experienced by the [[United States Navy]] during the [[Spanish American War]] with torpedo reliability and the dangers of [[sympathetic detonation]], it was decided not to use this weapon on the new cruisers. The [[main battery]] used the standard [[QF 6 inch /40 naval gun|{{convert|15.2|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}/40 naval gun]] found on most contemporary Japanese cruisers.&lt;ref name=Conway/&gt;

The ''Niitaka''-class cruisers were fitted with 16 [[Niclausse boiler]]s, a great improvement on the [[locomotive boiler]]s of the ''Suma'' class.&lt;ref name=Conway/&gt;

==Service life==
===Russo-Japanese War===
''Niitaka'' was commissioned just in time for the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and saw combat at the [[Battle of Chemulpo Bay]] on 2 February 1904 against the Russian cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Varyag|1899|2}}.&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;Warner, ''The Tide at Sunrise '', pages 187-190&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently participated in the [[shore bombardment]] of Russian positions during the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] on 9 March 1904. From April, ''Niitaka'' was assigned to patrols of the [[Korea Strait]] and the [[Sea of Japan]], but was not in position to participate in [[Battle off Ulsan]] on 14 August 1904. She did, however, assist in the rescue of Russian sailors off the sinking cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rurik|1892|2}} after the battle. At the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]], ''Niitaka'' was part of the 4th Detachment of [[2nd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Japanese 2nd Fleet]] against the Russian cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Askold|1900|2}}.She was subsequently one of the ships stationed at [[Makung]] in the [[Pescadores Islands]] to watch for the arrival of the [[Russian Baltic Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, ''The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the crucial final [[Battle of Tsushima]] on 27 May 1905, ''Niitaka'' was part of the Japanese squadron attacking the Russian cruisers {{ship|Russian cruiser|Oleg||2}}, {{ship|Russian cruiser|Aurora||2}} and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Zhemchug||2}} as well as the already heavily damaged battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Knyaz Suvorov||2}}. ''Niitaka'' took one hit during the engagement, which killed one crewman and wounded three others. On 28 May 1905, ''Niitaka'' and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Otowa||2}} intercepted and sank the cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Svetlana|1896|2}} which had been heavily damaged the day before and which was attempting to escape towards Korea together with a destroyer.&lt;ref name=Warner/&gt;

In October, ''Niitaka'' was assigned to detached duty, to provide escort for the passenger liner {{ship||Awa Maru|1899|2}}, which carried on board [[Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern]].

On 28 May 1905, ''Niitaka'' took part in the final combat of the battle against cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Dmitrii Donskoi||2}}. For the remainder of the war, ''Niitaka'' ferried troop convoys in the Sea of Japan, and was overhauled at the [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]] in September 1905.

After the war, ''Niitaka'' was assigned to patrol duties off the [[China]] coast, and was occasionally stationed at [[Manila]] to protect Japanese citizens and economic interests in the [[Philippines]].

===World War I===
[[File:Japanese cruiser Niitaka in 1918.jpg|thumb|right|At Sasebo in 1918]]
In [[World War I]], ''Niitaka'' participated in the [[Battle of Tsingtao]], and was later assigned to the [[IJN 3rd Fleet|Japanese 3rd Fleet]] based at [[Singapore]], to protect British shipping around [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] from German [[commerce raiding|commerce raiders]], as part of Japan’s contribution to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] war effort under the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]].&lt;ref name=Tucker&gt;Tucker, ''Encyclopedia Of World War I '', page 610&lt;/ref&gt; While at Singapore, 158 marines from the cruisers {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Otowa||2}} and ''Niitaka'' helped suppress the February [[1915 Singapore Mutiny]] by Indian [[Sepoy]] troops against the British.

From mid-1915 to 1918, ''Tsushima'' and ''Niitaka'' were permanently based at [[Cape Town]], assisting the [[Royal Navy]] in patrolling the [[sea lane]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]], linking [[Europe]] to the east against German commerce raiders and [[U-boat]]s.&lt;ref name=Tucker/&gt;

===Post-war career===
From September to July 1920, ''Niitaka'' assisted in the landings of Japanese forces in [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]] under the [[Siberian Intervention]] to help the [[White Movement|White Russian]] forces against the [[Bolshevik]]s in the [[Russian Civil War]], and to protect Japanese fishermen along the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]].

''Niitaka'' was assigned to patrols of the coasts of southern China and the northern edges of the [[Netherlands East Indies]] in the [[South China Sea]] from May–September 1921, and on 1 September 1921, was re-designated a 2nd class [[Coastal defence ship|coastal defense vessel]].

====Fate====
On 26 August 1922, ''Niitaka'' anchored near the mouth of a river in what is now part of the [[Ust-Bolsheretsky District]] on the southern coast of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], while a party of 15 led by Lieutenant [[Shigetada Gunji]] went ashore. Sudden [[typhoon]]-force winds drove the vessel onto rocks, where it overturned, killing all 284 people aboard at {{coord|51|30|N|156|29|E|type:event|display=inline,title}}. The only survivors were the members of the shore party. A Russian source states that the captain survived the accident, only to commit ''[[seppuku]]'' afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;A_5&quot;&gt;''Гаврилов С. В.'' Маленькие камчатские истории. — Петропавловск-Камчатский: Камчатский печатный двор, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

A salvage team sent in 1923 determined the wreck to be unsalvageable, and destroyed the remains with explosives. A concrete obelisk was also erected with a portion of the ship’s mast on a hill slightly north of the wreck site.&lt;ref&gt;Prostar Sailing Directions 2004, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Niitaka'' was formally written off the [[navy list]] on 1 April 1924.
