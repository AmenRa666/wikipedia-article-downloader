[[File:Naval Academy 1879 Football Team.png|thumb|right|The [[1879 Navy Midshipmen football team|1879 Naval Academy football team]], of which Cabaniss was a member]]
'''Charles Cabaniss''' (October 14, 1859 – January 19, 1882) was a [[midshipman]] in the [[United States Navy]] and early player of [[American football]]. Born and raised in [[Central Virginia]], he was appointed to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at the age of 16. At the academy, Cabaniss retained average-level grades and was a member of the school's [[1879 Navy Midshipmen football team|first-ever football team]]. He graduated in 1880 and was appointed to the [[USS Swatara (1873)|USS ''Swatara'']]. Cabaniss was killed in an accident on the ''Swatara'' in 1882 which received coverage throughout much of the Eastern United States.

==Life==

===At the Naval Academy===
Cabaniss was born on October 14, 1859 in [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. He grew up in [[Central Virginia]] until he was appointed to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at the age of sixteen years and eight months. He began classes at the academy on June 21, 1876 and was the only member of his class from Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Register 1876-21&quot;&gt;[[#Register 1876|Government Printing Office (1877)]], p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt; Cabaniss was an average student while at the Naval Academy; he finished 40th in his class of 69 in his second year, earning near-top marks in drawing and mathematics but very low marks in history and French language. He also spent the mandatory two months and eighteen days at sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Register 1877-18&quot;&gt;[[#Register 1877|Government Printing Office (1878)]], p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/ref&gt; Cabaniss had the fewest demerits of any member of his sophomore class and earned a spot on the academy's summer cruise on the [[USS Constellation (1854)|USS ''Constellation'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Register 1877-31&quot;&gt;[[#Register 1877|Government Printing Office (1878)]], p.&amp;nbsp;31&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabaniss's academic rankings remained generally the same in his following year at the academy. His scores in drawing, mathematics, and [[physics]] were above average, while his merits in French language and history were among the worst. He finished 33rd in the class of 66. He maintained his spot as the most disciplined in his class, earning fewer than half the demerits than the second-best.&lt;ref name=&quot;Register 1878-16&quot;&gt;[[#Register 1878|Government Printing Office (1879)]], p.&amp;nbsp;16&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charles Cabaniss' Naval Academy marks 1878.png|thumb|center|1000px|Cabaniss' record for his third year at the Naval Academy ''(in the order: class rank, name, state, date of appointment, age in: years, months, merits in: math, physics, history, french, drawing, total demerits, sea service in: months, days'')|alt=The name Charles Cabaniss followed by a series of numbers]]

Cabaniss finished his final year at the Naval Academy ranking 25th out of 61 graduates. The course requirements changed that year; Cabaniss received poor marks in [[seamanship]], tactics, [[naval tactics]], [[astronomy]], and French language, but very high marks in mathematics, electricity, and English composition courses. He maintained his good conduct, earning the second-fewest demerits of any cadet. This earned him an appointment as a Cadet [[Ensign]], a temporary position as an academy [[Officer cadet|officer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Register 1879-11&quot;&gt;[[#Register 1879|Government Printing Office (1880)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, the academy fielded its first [[1879 Navy Midshipmen football team|competitive football team]]. Although [[American football|football]] had seen some popularity at the school, there had not been an organized effort to establish it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertholf&quot;&gt;[[#Kroll|Kroll (2002)]], p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clary 97-9&quot;&gt;[[#Clary 97|Clary (1997)]], p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; Two different teams were assembled in 1879; only first-classmen (final-year students) were allowed to join the teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoor 5&quot;&gt;[[#Schoor|Schoor (1967)]], p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; Cabaniss joined the second team as a rusher, the equivalent of a modern-day [[offensive lineman]]. He played alongside future admiral [[Hugh Rodman]] and eventual [[List of Governors of Guam|Governor of Guam]] [[William John Maxwell]]. The academy's team played one game, a scoreless tie with the nearby Baltimore Athletic Club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bealle 7&quot;&gt;[[#Bealle|Bealle (1951)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Navy's rushers forced the Baltimore A.C. backwards into their own [[end zone]] for [[Safety (gridiron football score)|safeties]] on three separate occasions, and generally outplayed and overpowered their opponents the entire game.{{refn|group=Note|At the time, there was no uniform rules structure in college football. Each team typically set up their own rules for games they hosted. Under Navy's rules in 1879, safeties did not result in points; Navy changed this by the next season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bealle 7&quot;/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Clary 11&quot;&gt;[[#Clary 97|Clary (1997)]], p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Swatara'' and death===
[[File:Uss swatara 1872.jpg|thumb|right|The [[USS Swatara (1873)|USS ''Swatara'']], on which Cabaniss served his entire naval career|alt=A sailing ship on a river with a small sailboat behind it]]
On June 10, 1880, Cabaniss graduated from the academy and was sent home to await his orders. He was assigned on August 17 of that year to the [[USS Swatara (1873)|USS ''Swatara'']] as a part of the [[Asiatic Squadron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Record Institute&quot;&gt;[[#Naval Institute|United States Naval Institute (1882)]], p.&amp;nbsp;XXI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 1880&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writer |date=June 19, 1880 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2484802/army_and_navy_news_june_1880/ |title=Army And Navy News: Transfers, Leaves of Absence, and Detachments |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York City |page=5 |ISSN=0362-4331 |OCLC=1645522 |accessdate=May 26, 2015 |via=[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; For sixteen months, the ship was docked in [[Kobe, Japan]], during which time Cabaniss earned himself a positive reputation with other sailors. Crew mates described him as always being happy, with an intimidating, six-foot-tall physique but a personality that did not match. His disciplined nature remained; he reportedly was one of the best-behaved sailors, who spent all of his time either carrying out his duties or practicing to be a better officer. Cabaniss was never admonished for shore misconduct, a considerable issue for most other new officers and sailors. He was reportedly a favorite of the superior officers stationed in Kobe, and was appointed to a spot on the admiral's staff as a reward for his conduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette Feb 25&quot;&gt;[[#Gazette Feb 25|&quot;Recent Deaths&quot; (February 25, 1882)]], p.&amp;nbsp;657&lt;/ref&gt; Cabaniss was preparing for an examination for promotion early in February 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette Feb 18&quot;&gt;[[#Gazette Feb 18|&quot;Cadet Midshipman Charles Cabaniss&quot; (February 18, 1882)]], p.&amp;nbsp;632&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Cabaniss death New York Times.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The New York Times]]''' article about Cabaniss' death|alt=A short, one paragraph article written in old type font]] 
Cabaniss was killed in an accident on board the ''Swatara'' on January 19, 1882. An official report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when he broke off and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, was explaining to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed them how to load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every bone in his elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his [[latissimus dorsi muscle]]; went into his chest, severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited his right side, and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have never made a sound as he fell. The other sailor recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official report&quot;&gt;[[#Official report|Cooper (March 25, 1882)]], p.&amp;nbsp;757&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabaniss' body was ordered to be [[Embalming|embalmed]] but was not; the damage to his body was so severe that the embalming fluid would leak out. His body was buried in Kobe on February 24 with [[Military funeral|military honors]]. The entire crew of the ''Swatara'' attended, as well as the entire crew of [[HMS Flying Fish (1873)|HMS ''Flying Fish'']] and many noted Japanese citizens. Ensign Parker reportedly suffered from depression following the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette Feb 25&quot;/&gt; Cabaniss' death received significant media coverage in the Eastern United States. ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article on its second page, and among other papers that carried the story were the ''[[Star-News|Wilmington Morning Star]]'' and the ''[[The Progress-Index|Petersburg Index-Appeal]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writer |date=February 27, 1882 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2485241/cabaniss_death_nyt/ |title=The Death Of Midshipman Cabaniss |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York City |page=2 |ISSN=0362-4331 |OCLC=1645522 |accessdate=May 26, 2015 |via=[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilmington&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writer |date=March 3, 1882 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2485490/cabaniss_death/ |title=Morning Edition Outlines: The following will be interesting to many North Carolinians |newspaper=[[Star-News|The Wilmington Morning Star]] |location=[[Wilmington, NC]] |page=1 |ISSN=1937-4097 |OCLC=24839460 |accessdate=May 26, 2015 |via=[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
