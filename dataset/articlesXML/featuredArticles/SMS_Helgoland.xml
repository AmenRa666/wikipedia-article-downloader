'''SMS ''Helgoland''''',{{efn|name=SMS}} the lead ship of [[Helgoland-class battleship|her class]], was a [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]] of the [[German Imperial Navy]]. ''Helgoland''{{'}}s design represented an incremental improvement over the preceding {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|4}}, including an increase in the bore diameter of the main guns, from 28&amp;nbsp;cm (11&amp;nbsp;in) to 30.5&amp;nbsp;cm (12&amp;nbsp;in). Her keel was laid down on 11 November 1908 at the [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft|Howaldtswerke]] shipyards in [[Kiel]]. ''Helgoland'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 25 September 1909 and was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 23 August 1911.

Like most battleships of the [[High Seas Fleet]], ''Helgoland'' saw limited action against Britain's [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War I]]. The ship participated in several fruitless sweeps into the North Sea as the covering force for the battlecruisers of the [[I Scouting Group]]. She saw some limited duty in the [[Baltic Sea]] against the [[Russian Navy]], including serving as part of a support force during the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] in August 1915. ''Helgoland'' was present at the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May&amp;nbsp;– 1 June 1916, though she was located in the center of the German [[line of battle]] and not as heavily engaged as the {{sclass-|König|battleship|5}}- and {{sclass-|Kaiser|battleship|0}} ships in the lead. ''Helgoland'' was ceded to Great Britain at the end of the war and broken up for scrap in the early 1920s. Her [[coat of arms]] is preserved in the [[Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr]] in [[Dresden]].

== Construction ==
{{main|Helgoland-class battleship}}

''Helgoland'' was ordered by the German Imperial Navy (''Kaiserliche Marine'') under the provisional name ''Ersatz Siegfried'', as a replacement for the old [[coastal defense ship]] {{SMS|Siegfried||2}}. The contract for the ship was awarded to [[Howaldtswerke]] in [[Kiel]] under construction number 500.{{sfn|Gröner|p=24}} Work began on 24 December 1908 with the laying of her keel, and the ship was launched less than a year later, on 25 September 1909.{{sfn|Sturton|p=31}} [[Fitting-out]], including completion of the superstructure and the installation of armament, lasted until August 1911. ''Helgoland'', named for the [[Heligoland|offshore islands]] seen as vital to the defense of the [[Kiel Canal]],{{sfn|Herwig|p=31}} was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 23 August 1911, just under three years from when work commenced,{{sfn|Gröner|p=25}} at a cost of 46.196&amp;nbsp;million [[German gold mark|gold marks]].{{sfn|Herwig|p=61}}

The ship was {{convert|167.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|8.94|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and displaced {{convert|24,700|MT|LT|-1}} at full load. She was powered by three [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple expansion steam engines]], which produced a top speed of {{convert|20.8|kn}}. ''Helgoland'' stored up to {{convert|3,200|t|LT|sp=us}} of coal, which allowed her to steam for {{convert|5,500|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. After 1915 the boilers were modified to burn oil; the ship could carry up to {{convert|197|t|LT|sp=us}} of fuel oil.{{sfn|Gröner|p=24}}

''Helgoland'' was armed with a main battery of twelve [[30.5 cm SK L/50 gun|{{convert|30.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/50]]{{efn|name=gun nomenclature}} guns in six twin [[gun turret]]s, with one turret fore, one aft, and two on each flank of the ship.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Gray|p=146}} The ship's secondary armament consisted of fourteen {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/45 guns and sixteen {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/45 guns.{{sfn|Gröner|p=24}} After 1914, two of the 8.8&amp;nbsp;cm guns were removed and replaced by 8.8&amp;nbsp;cm anti-aircraft guns. ''Helgoland'' was also armed with six {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} submerged [[torpedo tube]]s.{{sfn|Gröner|p=25}}

== Service history ==
Upon commissioning, ''Helgoland'' replaced the [[pre-dreadnought]] {{SMS|Hannover||2}} in the I Battle Squadron.{{sfn|Staff (''Battleships'')|p=42}} On 9 February 1912, ''Helgoland''{{'}}s crew beat the German record for loading coal, taking 1,100&amp;nbsp;tons of coal on board in two hours; the record was previously held by the crew of the ''Nassau''-class battleship {{SMS|Posen||2}}. Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] congratulated the crew through a Cabinet order.{{sfn|United States Naval Institute|p=757}} In March, fleet training maneuvers were conducted in the [[North Sea]], followed by another round of exercises in November. The fleet also trained in the [[Skagerrak]] and [[Kattegat]] during the November exercises. The next year followed a similar training pattern, though a summer cruise to Norway was instituted.{{sfn|Staff (''Battleships'')|p=42}}

=== 1914 summer training cruise ===
[[File:Balestrand.jpg|thumb|A section of the fjord, with Balholm on its far bank|alt=Tall, steep, snow-capped mountains line a narrow body of water. A small village sits on a narrow strip of flat ground at the base.]]

On 10 July 1914, ''Helgoland'' left the [[Jade Estuary]] to take part in the annual summer training cruise to [[Norway]]. The fleet, along with several German [[U-boat]]s, assembled at [[Skagen]] on 12 July to practice torpedo boat attacks, individual ship maneuvers, and searchlight techniques. The fleet arrived at the [[Sognefjord|Fjord of Songe]] by 18 July, but ''Helgoland'' had to wait until after midnight for a harbor pilot to guide her into the confined waters of the fjord.{{sfn|Stumpf|pp=17–18}} ''Helgoland'' joined {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}}, the light cruiser {{SMS|Magdeburg||2}}, and the Kaiser's yacht {{ship|SMY|Hohenzollern||2}} in Balholm.{{sfn|Stumpf|pp=18–19}}

That same day, ''Helgoland'' took on 1250&amp;nbsp;tons of coal from a Norwegian [[Collier (ship type)|collier]].{{sfn|Stumpf|pp=18–20}} The following morning ''Helgoland'' was joined by her sister {{SMS|Oldenburg||2}}, and the two ships sailed back to Germany, arriving on the morning of 22 July.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=22}} On the evening of 1 August, the captain announced to the crew that the Kaiser had ordered the navy to prepare for hostilities with the [[Russian Navy]].{{sfn|Stumpf|pp=22–23}}

=== Outbreak of war ===
At the start of [[World War I]], ''Helgoland'' was assigned to the I Division, I Battle Squadron.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=286}} ''Helgoland'' was stationed off the heavily fortified island of [[Wangerooge]] on 9 August. Minefields and picket lines of cruisers, torpedo boats, and submarines were also emplaced there to defend Wilhelmshaven. ''Helgoland''{{'}}s engines were kept running for the entirety of her deployment, so that she would be ready to respond at a moment's notice.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=29}} Four days later, on 13 August, ''Helgoland'' returned to Wilhelmshaven to refuel.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=30}} The following day, naval reservists began arriving to fill out the wartime complements for the German battleships.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=32}}

=== Actions in the North Sea ===

==== Battle of Helgoland Bight ====
The first major naval action in the North Sea, the [[Battle of Helgoland Bight]], took place on 28 August 1914. ''Helgoland'' was again stationed off Wangerooge. Despite her proximity to the battle, ''Helgoland'' was not sent to aid the beleaguered German cruisers, as she could not be risked in an unsupported attack against possibly superior British forces.{{sfn|Osborne|p=41}} Instead, the ship was ordered to drop anchor and await relief by {{SMS|Thüringen||2}}.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=38}} By 04:30, ''Helgoland'' received the order to join {{SMS|Ostfriesland||2}} and sail out of the harbor. At 05:00, the two battleships met the battered cruisers {{SMS|Frauenlob||2}} and {{SMS|Stettin||2}}.{{sfn|Stumpf|pp=40–41}} By 07:30, the ships had returned to port for the night.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=42}} Three days later, on 31 August, ''Helgoland'' was put into [[drydock]] for maintenance.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=44}} On the afternoon of 7 September, ''Helgoland'' and the rest of the High Seas Fleet conducted a training cruise to the main island of [[Heligoland]].{{sfn|Stumpf|p=46}}

==== Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby ====

The German battleships lie to the east of the other ships.]]

The first major operation of the war in which ''Helgoland'' took part was the [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]] on 15–16 December 1914. The raid was conducted by the battlecruisers of the [[I Scouting Group]]; ''Helgoland'' and the other dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet steamed in distant support of [[Franz von Hipper]]'s battlecruisers. [[Friedrich von Ingenohl]], the commander of the High Seas Fleet, decided to take up station in the middle of the North Sea, about 130&amp;nbsp;miles east of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]].{{sfn|Tarrant|p=31}}

The [[Royal Navy]], which had recently received the German code books captured from the beached cruiser {{SMS|Magdeburg||2}}, was aware that an operation was taking place, but was not sure where the Germans would strike. Therefore, the [[Admiralty]] ordered [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty's]] 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, the six battleships of the 2nd Battle Squadron, and several cruisers and destroyers to intercept the German battlecruisers.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=31}} However, Beatty's task force nearly ran headlong into the entire High Seas Fleet. At 06:20, Beatty's destroyer [[wikt:screen#Noun|screen]] came into contact with the German torpedo boat {{SMS|V155}}. This began a confused, 2-hour battle between the British destroyers and the German cruiser and destroyer screen, often at very close range. At the time of the first encounter, the ''Helgoland''-class battleships were less than {{convert|10|nmi}} away from the six British dreadnoughts; this was nearly within firing range, but in the darkness, neither British nor German admirals were aware of the composition of their opponents' fleets. Admiral Ingenohl, aware of the Kaiser's order not to risk the battle fleet without his express approval, concluded that his forces were engaging the screen of the entire [[Grand Fleet]], and so, 10 minutes after the first contact, he ordered a turn to the southeast. Continued attacks delayed the turn, but by 06:42, it had been carried out.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=32}} For about 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, the two fleets were steaming on a parallel course. At 07:20, Ingenohl ordered a further turn to port, which put his ships on a course for the safety of German bases.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=33}}

==== Training in Kiel ====
On 17 January, Ingenohl ordered ''Helgoland'' to go back to the docks for more maintenance, but she did not enter the drydock until three days later, owing to difficulties getting through the canal locks.{{sfn|Stumpf|pp=58–59}} By the middle of the month, ''Helgoland'' left dock; her berth was then filled by the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Roon}}.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=63}} On 10 February, ''Helgoland'' and the rest of the I Squadron sailed out of Wilhelmshaven towards [[Cuxhaven]], but heavy fog impeded movement for two days. The ships then anchored off [[Brunsbüttel]] before proceeding through the [[Kiel Canal]] to Kiel.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=67}} The crews conducted gunnery training with the main and secondary guns and torpedo firing practice on 1 March.{{sfn|Stumpf|pp=70–71}} The following night the crews conducted night-fighting training. On 10 March the squadron again passed through the locks to return to Wilhelmshaven.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=72}} Fog again slowed progress, and the ships did not reach port until 15 March.{{sfn|Stumpf|p=74}}

=== Battle of the Gulf of Riga ===
{{main|Battle of the Gulf of Riga}}

''Helgoland'', her three sister ships, and the four ''Nassau''-class battleships were assigned to the task force that was to cover the foray into the [[Gulf of Riga]] in August 1915. The German flotilla, which was under the command of Vice Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]], also included the [[battlecruiser]]s {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}, {{SMS|Moltke||2}}, and {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}, several [[light cruiser]]s, 32 [[destroyer]]s and 13 [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]]. The plan called for channels in Russian minefields to be swept so that the Russian naval presence, which included the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Slava||2}}, could be eliminated. The Germans would then lay minefields of their own to prevent Russian ships from returning to the gulf.{{sfn|Halpern|p=196}} ''Helgoland'' and the majority of the other big ships of the High Seas Fleet remained outside the gulf for the entirety of the operation. The dreadnoughts {{SMS|Nassau||2}} and {{SMS|Posen||2}} were detached on 16 August to escort the minesweepers and to destroy ''Slava'', though they failed to sink the old battleship. After three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the gulf on 19 August, but reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the gulf the following day.{{sfn|Halpern|pp=197–198}}

=== Battle of Jutland ===
[[File:SMS Helgoland bridge.PNG|thumb|''Helgoland''{{'}}s bridge and forward main battery turrets|alt=A large warship's bridge and two gun turrets]]

Under the command of Captain von Kameke,{{sfn|Scheer|p=137}} ''Helgoland'' fought at the [[Battle of Jutland]], alongside her sister ships in the I Battle Squadron. For the majority of the battle, the I&amp;nbsp;Battle Squadron formed the center of the [[line of battle]], behind Rear Admiral Behncke's III&amp;nbsp;Battle Squadron, and followed by Rear Admiral Mauve's elderly [[pre-dreadnought]]s of the II&amp;nbsp;Battle Squadron.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=286}}

''Helgoland'' and her sisters first entered direct combat shortly after 18:00. The German line was steaming northward and encountered the destroyers {{HMS|Nomad||2}} and {{HMS|Nestor|1915|2}}, which had been disabled earlier in the battle. ''Nomad'', which had been attacked by the {{sclass-|Kaiser|battleship|0}} ships at the head of the line, exploded and sank at 18:30, followed five minutes later by the ''Nestor'', sunk by main and secondary gunfire from ''Helgoland'', ''Thüringen'' and several other German battleships.{{sfn|Campbell|p=101}} At 19:20, ''Helgoland'' and several other battleships began firing on {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}}, which, along with the other {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s of the 5th Battle squadron, had been pursuing the German battlecruiser force. The shooting stopped quickly though, as the Germans lost sight of their target; ''Helgoland'' had fired only about 20 shells from her main guns.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=142–143}}

At 20:15, during the third ''Gefechtskehrtwendung'',{{efn|name=battle about-turn}} ''Helgoland'' was struck by a {{convert|15|in|cm|adj=on}} [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] (AP) shell, from either {{HMS|Barham|04|2}} or {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}}, in the forward part of the ship. The shell hit the [[armored belt]] about 0.8&amp;nbsp;m (32&amp;nbsp;in) above the [[waterline]], where the armor was only 15&amp;nbsp;cm thick. The 15-inch shell broke up on impact, but it still managed to tear a {{convert|1.4|m|ftin|adj=on|sp=us}} hole in the hull.{{sfn|Campbell|p=245}} It rained splinters on the foremost port side 15&amp;nbsp;cm gun, though it could still be fired.{{sfn|Campbell|p=246}} Approximately 80&amp;nbsp;tons of water entered the ship.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=173, 175}}

By 23:30, the High Seas Fleet had entered its night cruising formation. The order had largely been inverted, with the four ''Nassau''-class ships in the lead, followed directly by the ''Helgoland''s, with the ''Kaiser''s and ''König''s astern of them. The rear was again brought up by the elderly pre-dreadnoughts; the mauled German battlecruisers were by this time scattered.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=275–276}} At around midnight on 1 June, the ''Helgoland''- and ''Nassau''-class ships in the center of the German line came into contact with the British 4th Destroyer Flotilla. The 4th Flotilla broke off the action temporarily to regroup, but at around 01:00, unwittingly stumbled into the German dreadnoughts a second time.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=222}} ''Helgoland'' and ''Oldenburg'' opened fire on the two leading British destroyers.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=223}} ''Helgoland'' fired six salvos from her secondary guns at the destroyer ''Fortune'' before she succumbed to the tremendous battering.{{sfn|Campbell|p=289}} Shortly after, ''Helgoland'' shifted fire to an unidentified destroyer; ''Helgoland'' fired five salvos from her 15&amp;nbsp;cm guns to unknown effect.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=290–291}} The British destroyers launched torpedoes at the German ships, but they managed to successfully evade them with a turn to starboard.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=224}}

Following the return to German waters, ''Helgoland'' and ''Thüringen'', along with the {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|2}}s {{SMS|Nassau||2}}, {{SMS|Posen||2}}, and {{SMS|Westfalen||2}}, took up defensive positions in the [[Jadebusen|Jade]] [[roadstead]] for the night. During the battle, the ship suffered only minor damage; ''Helgoland'' was hit by a single 15-inch shell, but sustained minimal damage.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=263}} Nevertheless, dry-docking was required to repair the hole in the belt armor. Work was completed by 16 June.{{sfn|Campbell|p=336}} In the course of the battle, ''Helgoland'' had fired 63 main battery shells,{{sfn|Campbell|p=348}} and 61 rounds from her 15&amp;nbsp;cm guns.{{sfn|Campbell|p=359}}

=== Later actions ===
After the Battle of Jutland, Admiral Scheer argued that the fleet could not break the British naval blockade, that only the resumption of unrestricted U-boat warfare would be successful. As a result, the High Seas Fleet largely remained in port, with the exception of two abortive sorties in August and October 1916.{{sfn|Halpern|pp=330–332}} In April 1917, ''Helgoland'' accidentally rammed the new battlecruiser {{SMS|Hindenburg||2}}, which was in the process of fitting-out, as she left her berth.{{sfn|Staff (''Battleships'')|p=42}} In October 1917 ''Helgoland'', in company with {{SMS|Oldenburg||2}}, went to [[Amrum]] to receive the light cruisers {{SMS|Brummer||2}} and {{SMS|Bremse||2}}, which were returning from a raid on a British convoy to Norway. On 27 November the ship traversed the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal into the Baltic, but did not participate in the [[Operation Albion|occupation of the islands in the Gulf of Riga]].{{sfn|Staff (''Battleships'')|p=42}} A third and final fleet advance took place in April 1918, but was cut short when the battlecruiser {{SMS|Moltke||2}} developed engine problems and had to be towed back to port.{{sfn|Staff (''Battlecruisers'')|p=17}}

=== Wilhelmshaven mutiny ===
{{main|Wilhelmshaven mutiny}}

''Helgoland'' and her three sisters were to have taken part in a [[Naval order of 24 October 1918|final fleet action]] days before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]] was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; [[Reinhard Scheer|Scheer]]—by now the [[Grand Admiral]] (''Großadmiral'') of the fleet—intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=280–281}}

On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on {{SMS|Thüringen||2}} and then on several other battleships mutinied.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=281–282}} Early on the 31st, the crew of ''Helgoland'', which was directly behind ''Thüringen'' in the harbor, joined in the mutiny. The I Squadron commander sent boats to ''Helgoland'' and ''Thüringen'' to take off the ships' officers, who were allowed to leave unharmed. He then informed the rebellious crews that if they failed to stand down, both ships would be torpedoed. After two [[torpedo boat]]s arrived on the scene, both ships surrendered; their crews were taken ashore and incarcerated.{{sfn|New York Times Co.|p=440}} The rebellion then spread ashore; on 3 November, an estimated 20,000 sailors, dock workers, and civilians fought a battle in [[Kiel]] in an attempt to secure the release of the jailed mutineers.{{sfn|Schwartz|p=48}} By 5 November, the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] of the Socialists flew above every capital ship in Wilhelmshaven save {{SMS|König||2}}. The following day, a sailors' council took control of the base, and a train carrying the mutineers from ''Helgoland'' and ''Thüringen'' was stopped in [[Cuxhaven]], where the men escaped.{{sfn|Schwartz|p=48}}

=== Post-war ===
According to the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], all four ''Helgoland''-class battleships were disarmed and surrendered as [[prize of war|prizes of war]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] as replacements for the ships [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled in Scapa Flow]].{{r|Article 185}}{{sfn|Hore|p=68}} On 21–22 November 1918, ''Helgoland'' steamed to [[Harwich]] to retrieve the crews of U-boats that had been surrendered there. She was then removed from active service on 16&amp;nbsp;December 1918.{{sfn|Staff (''Battleships'')|p=42}} ''Helgoland'' and her sisters were stricken from the German navy on 5&amp;nbsp;November 1919.{{sfn|Miller|p=101}} ''Helgoland'' was formally handed over to the [[United Kingdom]] on 5&amp;nbsp;August 1920. She was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] at [[Morecambe]]; work began on 3&amp;nbsp;March 1921. ''Helgoland''{{'}}s [[coat of arms]] is currently preserved in the [[Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr]] in [[Dresden]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=25}}
