The '''''Formidabile'' class''' was a pair of [[ironclad warship]]s built for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) in the 1860s. The class comprised two ships, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Formidabile||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Terribile||2}}. Initially ordered for the ''Regia Marina Sarda'' (Royal Sardinian Navy), by the time they were completed the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] had [[Italian unification|unified]] the rest of the Italian states and created the ''Regia Marina''. They were the first ironclads built for the Italian fleet. Wooden-hulled vessels plated with {{convert|4.3|in|0}} of [[wrought iron]], they were armed with a battery of twenty guns in a [[broadside]] arrangement. 

Both vessels were involved in the operations off [[Vis (island)|Lissa]] in July 1866, but neither took part in the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] on 20 July. ''Formidabile'' had been damaged by Austrian coastal fortifications the day before, and had withdrawn for repairs; ''Terribile'' was ready for action, but had been preparing to attack Lissa and was too far south to take an active role in the battle. Both ships saw minimal use in the 1870s and 1880s, until both were withdrawn from service for use as [[training ship]]s. ''Formidabile'' and ''Terribile'' served in this capacity until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they were sold and [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap.

==Design==
The two ships of the ''Formidabile'' class were ordered by [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], then both the Prime Minister and Naval Minister of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in 1860,&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before the [[unification of Italy]]. The ships were originally intended to be armored [[floating battery|floating batteries]], but they were redesigned as sea-going ironclads after construction began.&lt;ref name=G337&gt;Gardiner, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=O328&gt;Ordovini et al., p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; These ships were the first components of a major naval expansion program that was designed to prepare a fleet of [[ironclad warship]]s capable of defeating the [[Austrian Navy]]. Italy considered the [[Austrian Empire]] to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General characteristics and machinery===
The ''Formidabile''-class ships were wooden-[[hull (watercraft)|hulled]] vessels, sheathed with [[wrought iron]] armor that was {{convert|4.3|in|abbr=on|0}} thick. They were {{convert|63.05|m|sp=us}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|65.8|m|abbr=on}} and [[length overall|long overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.44|m|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.45|m|abbr=on}}. The ships displaced {{convert|2682|MT|sp=us}} normally and up to {{convert|2807|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} at full load. Each vessel had a crew of 371&amp;nbsp;officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=G337/&gt;

Their propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion [[steam engine]] that drove a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by six coal-fired, rectangular [[boiler]]s. The boilers were trunked into a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]. Their engines produced a top speed of {{convert|10|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|1080|ihp|lk=in}}, though ''Terribile''{{'}}s boilers produced a slightly higher horsepower, at {{convert|1100|ihp|abbr=on}}. They could steam for about {{convert|1300|nmi|lk=in}} at their top speed. To supplement the steam engine, the ships were [[schooner]]-rigged with three [[mast (sailing)|masts]].&lt;ref name=G337/&gt;

===Armament===
The ships of the ''Formidabile'' class were originally intended to be armed with thirty guns, but after their conversion to sea-going [[broadside ironclad]]s, their armament was reduced to twenty guns. These consisted of four {{convert|203|mm|abbr=on}} guns and sixteen {{convert|164|mm|abbr=on}} [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading]] guns. Their armament was revised several times throughout their careers. In 1878, both ships had their battery reduced to eight 203&amp;nbsp;mm guns. ''Terribile'' was re-armed with two {{convert|6|in|abbr=on|0}} guns, two {{convert|5.9|in|abbr=on|0}} guns, and four {{convert|4.7|in|abbr=on|0}} guns for service as a [[training ship]] in 1885. Two years later, ''Formidabile'' was similarly converted into a training ship, equipped with only six 4.7&amp;nbsp;in guns.&lt;ref name=G337/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Formidabile (1861).jpg|thumb|''Formidabile'' c. 1870]]

The first ironclads to enter service in the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' of the newly-unified [[Kingdom of Italy]], ''Formidabile'' and ''Terribile'' served as the core of the fleet that was later fleshed out by the {{sclass-|Principe di Carignano|ironclad|5}}, {{sclass-|Re d'Italia|ironclad|5}}, and {{sclass-|Regina Maria Pia|ironclad|4}}es that would see action during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] against the [[Austrian Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 335&amp;ndash;339&lt;/ref&gt; The war broke out in June 1866, as Italy, which had allied with [[Prussia]], sought to take advantage of the [[Austro-Prussian War]] to seize Austrian-controlled [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus (1994), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; After initially remaining in port, the Italian fleet under Admiral [[Carlo Pellion di Persano]] launched an attack on the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]] in mid-July; the Austrian fleet under Rear Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] sortied to mount a counterattack, which resulted in the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] on 20 July. ''Formidable'', which had been badly damaged during an engagement with Austrian coastal fortifications on Lissa the day before, had withdrawn by the time Tegetthoff arrived and took no part in the battle. ''Terribile'' also played no role in the action, as she had been stationed too far to the south in preparation for another attack on the island, and she arrived on the scene of the battle only after the two fleets had disengaged.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 217–222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 219–241&lt;/ref&gt;

The two ships, which rapidly became obsolescent due to the development of [[central battery ironclad]]s and later [[turret ship]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus (2001), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; remained in service until the 1880s, having been modernized with new boilers and guns in the 1870s.&lt;ref name=G337/&gt; Neither ship played a role in the attack on [[Civitavecchia]] in 1870&amp;mdash;the last stage of the Italian wars of unification&amp;mdash;owing to the very poor state of the ''Regia Marina'' in the aftermath of Lissa.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; ''Formidable'' served as a gunnery [[training ship]] from 1887 to 1903, when she was discarded. ''Terribile'' also served as a training ship, beginning in 1885; she was sold for scrap in 1904 and [[ship breaking|broken up]] thereafter.&lt;ref name=G337/&gt;
