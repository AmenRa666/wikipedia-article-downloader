[[File:USS Ulua (SS-428) and USS Trumpetfish (SS-425) under construction.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Ulua|SS-428|2}} (left) and ''Trumpetfish'' (right) under construction at the [[Cramp Shipbuilding Company]] in [[Philadelphia]] on 2 July 1945.]]

'''USS ''Trumpetfish'' (SS-425)''', a {{sclass-|Balao|submarine}}, was the only ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[trumpetfish]], any of several fishes so-called for their deep, compressed body and long, tubular snout. Her keel was laid down on 23 August 1943 at [[Philadelphia]] by the [[Cramp Shipbuilding Company]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 13 May 1945 sponsored by Mrs. Oswald S. Colclough, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 29 January 1946 with Lieutenant Commander Raphael C. Benitez in command.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/trumpetfish.html |title= Trumpetfish SS-425 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pacific Fleet service==

A combined shakedown and goodwill cruise to ports in the [[Caribbean Sea]] in the early spring of 1946 preceded the submarine's westward cruise to [[Pearl Harbor]]. Highlighting the ship's training operations in Hawaiian waters was her intentional torpedoing of the large {{sclass-|I-400|submarine|2}}s which had been captured at the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

==Atlantic Fleet service==

''Trumpetfish'' returned to the East Coast for local operations out of New London, Connecticut, and, late in 1946, was briefly based at Annapolis to conduct training cruises for [[United States Naval Academy]] midshipmen. In the summer of 1947, as the ship underwent a [[Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program]] (GUPPY) conversion, her hull was streamlined, a [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] system was added, and higher capacity batteries were installed. The net result of the conversion enhanced the ship's offensive capabilities and increased her maximum submerged speed.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Attached to Submarine Squadron 4, based at [[Key West, Florida]], ''Trumpetfish'' conducted local operations and training exercises off the East Coast. In September 1953, she participated in [[NATO]] Exercise &quot;Mariner&quot; and then was deployed to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]].&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

After returning home, the ship operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean through 1955. Following duties out of Key West in January and February 1956, ''Trumpetfish'' proceeded to [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] for service with the Fleet Training Group. In July, the ship took part in midshipmen training cruises from [[Annapolis, Maryland]], to Guantanamo Bay and back.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

In the fall of 1956, the ship joined a hunter-killer group for a deployment to Europe and the Middle East. Departing Norfolk on 1 October 1956, ''Trumpetfish'' sailed for European waters and participated in training exercises as she crossed the Atlantic. After calling at [[Brest, France]], ''Trumpetfish'' suddenly received word of a crisis in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

==Middle East deployment==

[[President of Egypt]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] had nationalized the previously British-owned [[Suez Canal]], and prevailing Arab-Israeli tensions had erupted into warfare while British and French troops attacked Egyptian positions. ''Trumpetfish'' made her best speed for [[Suda Bay]] and joined the Sixth Fleet in peace-keeping missions in the eastern Mediterranean. With the cessation of hostilities, ''Trumpetfish'' resumed her Mediterranean cruise operating briefly with the [[Marina Militare|Italian fleet]] before returning to Key West on 28 January 1957.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

The submarine conducted local operations out of her home port until 29 August, when she got underway for European waters and fall NATO exercises. Air, surface, and submarine forces of NATO nations engaged in tests and exercises to hone their capabilities to defend the NATO nations against possible aggression. After returning to Key West on 25 October, ''Trumpetfish'' operated out of that base conducting training and exercises into 1959.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

During her next Mediterranean deployment, she snorkeled through the [[Strait of Bonifacio]] between [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]]. In August 1959, as part of Atlantic Fleet dispersal plans, ''Trumpetfish''’s home port was changed to [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. During January and February 1960, the submarine took part in operations in the North Atlantic before briefly visiting [[Scotland]]. She subsequently participated in exercises in the western [[Atlantic Ocean]], before a major refit at Charleston during 1961 modernized the ship to a [[Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program]] (GUPPY) III configuration. The alterations increased her capabilities by adding {{convert|15|ft}} to her length, by giving her better weapons and electronics, and by extending her range.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

==Cuban Missile Crisis==

''Trumpetfish'' resumed a schedule of local antisubmarine warfare operations out of Charleston, alternating deployments to the Mediterranean and duty with the Sixth Fleet. She participated in emergency operations during the tension precipitated by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962. The submarine later participated in several inter-type fleet exercises in home waters and in the Caribbean. ''Trumpetfish'' underwent a routine yard period at Charleston before taking part in Exercises &quot;Plumb Bob I&quot; and &quot;Minibox&quot; in 1965. After a Mediterranean deployment in early 1966, the ship took part in &quot;Plumb Bob II&quot; and provided services for the [[David Taylor Model Basin]].&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

==Post Cuban Missile Crisis==

Subsequently assigned the primary mission of providing services for antisubmarine warfare forces, ''Trumpetfish'' stood ready to conduct [[naval mine|mining]] and reconnaissance missions as well. On 12 January 1970, the submarine departed Charleston for [[Cape Kennedy]], provided services en route to submarine {{USS|Remora|SS-487|2}}, and conducted type training exercises. A port visit to Cape Kennedy occupied 16 January to 18 January, before the submarine got underway for [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], to provide services for the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory Test Facility]] (NOLTF) there. Ten days of local operations at the NOLTF preceded the ship's providing services for {{USS|Henry Clay|SSBN-625|2}} during the nuclear ballistic missile submarine's sea trials off the [[Florida]] coast from 6 February to 8 February. Subsequently taking part in Operations &quot;Springboard&quot; and &quot;Exotic Dancer III,&quot; ''Trumpetfish'' headed for [[Philadelphia]], and a yard overhaul which would last through the summer and fall and into December 1970.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

After the long overhaul, the submarine participated in type and refresher training off the East Coast before she headed for the Caribbean in the spring. Among her activities were those which provided services for the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]'s [[destroyer]] {{ship|German destroyer|Lütjens||2}} between 7 May and 14 May. The exchange of several crew members with the [[Bundesmarine]] ship during this time provided a valuable and enlightening experience.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

On 5 June, after participating in a fleet [[naval mine]] test, ''Trumpetfish'' commenced six weeks of pre-deployment upkeep, with sea trials from 12 July to 16 July. On 23 July, the submarine departed for South American waters and Operation &quot;Unites XII.&quot; Joining Task Force (TF) 86, ''Trumpetfish'' arrived at [[Cartagena, Colombia]], on 6 August, prior to transiting the [[Panama Canal]] to proceed down the Pacific coast of South America. She crossed the equator on 20 August and made port at [[Callao, Peru]], on 30 August. The ship operated with TF&amp;nbsp;86 for two weeks after the four-day port visit at Callao, before arriving at [[Valparaíso]], [[Chile]], on 17 September.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

The submarine traversed the inland waterway and the [[Strait of Magellan]] and arrived at [[Punta Arenas, Chile]], on 4 October. She conducted operations during &quot;Unites XII&quot; off the Atlantic coast of South America, with visits to [[March Del Plata, Argentina]], and [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], before rejoining TF&amp;nbsp;86 at [[La Guaira, Venezuela]], on 2 December. Bidding farewell to the task force four days later, the ship sailed for Charleston and arrived at her home port on 17 December 1971.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

''Trumpetfish'' remained with SubRon 4, operating out of Charleston through 1972. She deployed to the Caribbean again on 25 January 1973. Later conducting torpedo tests off [[Newport, Rhode Island]], the submarine operated with British [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|2}} off [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], in May, before returning to Charleston on 30 January. Upkeep, type training, and services for Patrol Wing 11&amp;nbsp;in the [[Jacksonville, Florida]], area preceded the ship's arrival at Charleston on 15 August to prepare for decommissioning.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

==Transfer to Brazilian Navy==

On 15 October 1973, at Charleston, ''Trumpetfish'' was decommissioned, stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]], and turned over to the Brazilian government.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

She was commissioned into the [[Brazilian Navy]] as ''Goias'' (S-15) (named for [[Goias]], the Brazilian state) with Commander Edouardo Russo her first commanding officer.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; ''Goias'' was deleted from the ''Marinha do Brasil'' on 16 April 1990.
