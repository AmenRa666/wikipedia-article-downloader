[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''John Rushworth Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|OM|GCVO|SGM|DL}} (5 December 1859 – 20 November 1935) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer. He fought in the [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|Anglo-Egyptian War]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and commanded the [[Grand Fleet]] at the [[Battle of Jutland]] in May 1916 during the [[First World War]]. His handling of the fleet at that battle was controversial: he made no serious mistakes and the German [[High Seas Fleet]] retreated to port – at a time when defeat would have been catastrophic for Britain – but the British public was disappointed that the Royal Navy had not won a victory on the scale of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Jellicoe later served as [[First Sea Lord]], overseeing the expansion of the Naval Staff at the Admiralty and the introduction of [[convoy]]s, but was removed at the end of 1917. He also served as the [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] in the early 1920s.

==Early career==
Born the son of John Henry Jellicoe, a captain in the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]], and Lucy Henrietta Jellicoe (née Keele) and educated at Field House School in [[Rottingdean]], Jellicoe joined the [[Royal Navy]] as a [[cadet]] in the training ship {{HMS|Britannia|1860|6}} in 1872.&lt;ref name=heath128&gt;Heathcote, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a [[midshipman]] in the [[steam frigate]] {{HMS|Newcastle|1860|6}} in September 1874 before transferring to the [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] {{HMS|Agincourt|1865|6}} in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in July 1877.&lt;ref name=heath128/&gt; Promoted to [[sub-lieutenant]] on 5 December 1878, he joined {{HMS|Alexandra|1875|6}}, flagship of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], as signal sub-lieutenant in 1880.&lt;ref name=heath128/&gt; Promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 23 September 1880,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=24876|date=24 August 1880 |startpage=4623 |supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to HMS ''Agincourt'' in February 1881 and commanded a rifle company of the [[Naval Brigade]] at [[Ismailia]] during the [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|Egyptian war]] of 1882.&lt;ref name=heath128/&gt;

Jellicoe qualified as a gunnery officer in 1883 and was appointed to the staff of the gunnery school {{HMS|Excellent|shore establishment|6}} in May 1884.&lt;ref name=heath128/&gt; He joined the turret ship {{HMS|Monarch|1868|6}} as gunnery officer in September 1885 and was awarded the [[Sea Gallantry Medal|Board of Trade Silver Medal]] for rescuing the crew of a capsized steamer near [[Gibraltar]] in May 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangiorgioaste.com/eng-site/auctions/elenco_cat.asp?codice=65|title=Auction 26 Orders, Decorations and medals|publisher=San Georgio|date=April 2012|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Colossus|1882|^}} in April 1886 and was put in charge of the experimental department at HMS ''Excellent'' in December 1886 before being appointed assistant to the Director of Naval Ordnance in September 1889.&lt;ref name=heath129&gt;Heathcote, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMSVictoriasinking1893.jpg|left|thumb|The battleship [[HMS Victoria (1887)|HMS ''Victoria'']] sinking]]
Promoted to [[commander]] on 30 June 1891, Jellicoe joined the battleship {{HMS|Sans Pareil|1887|6}} in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in March 1892.&lt;ref name=heath129/&gt; He transferred to the battleship {{HMS|Victoria|1887|6}} in 1893 (the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Vice Admiral [[George Tryon|Sir George Tryon]]) and was aboard when it collided with {{HMS|Camperdown|1885|6}}  and was wrecked off [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in [[Lebanon]] on 22 June 1893.&lt;ref name=heath129/&gt; He was then appointed to the new flagship, {{HMS|Ramillies|1892|6}}, in October 1893.&lt;ref name=heath129/&gt;

Promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] on 1 January 1897,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=26809|date=1 January 1897 |startpage=3 |supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jellicoe became a member of the Admiralty's Ordnance Committee.&lt;ref name=heath129/&gt; He served as Captain of the battleship {{HMS|Centurion|1892|6}} and chief of staff to Vice Admiral [[Edward Hobart Seymour|Sir Edward Seymour]] during the [[Seymour Expedition]] to relieve the legations at [[Beijing|Peking]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in June 1900.&lt;ref name=heath129/&gt; He was badly wounded during the [[Battle of Beicang]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27235|date=5 October 1900 |startpage=6098 |supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and told he would die but confounded the attending doctor and chaplain by living.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] and given the German [[Order of the Red Eagle]], 2nd class, with Crossed Swords for services rendered in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Admiral Sir John Jellicoe |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/78/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=19 October 1914 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Centurion'' returned to the United Kingdom in August 1901, and was paid off the following month, when Captain Jellicoe and the crew went on leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; military intelligence |day_of_week=Friday |date=20 September 1901 |page_number=8 |issue=36565| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became Naval Assistant to [[Third Sea Lord|Third Naval Lord and Controller of the Navy]] in February 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=9 April 1902 |page_number=10 |issue=36737| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given command of the armoured [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Drake|1901|6}} on the [[North America and West Indies Station]] in August 1903.&lt;ref name=heath129/&gt;

==High command==

[[File:AdmiralissimeJellicoe.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Admiral, or as the French knew him: ''Amiralissime Jellicoe'']]
As a protege of Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]], Jellicoe became Director of Naval Ordnance in 1905 and, having been appointed a [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] on the occasion of launching of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} on 10 February 1906,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27885 |date=13 February 1906 |startpage=1037|supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also made an [[Aide-de-Camp]] to [[Edward VII|the King]] on 8 March 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27897 |date=23 March 1906 |startpage=2061|supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[rear admiral]] on 8 February 1907,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27993 |date=8 February 1907 |startpage=899|supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he pushed hard for funds to modernise the navy, supporting the construction of new {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|2}}-type battleships and {{sclass-|Invincible|battlecruiser|2}}s.&lt;ref name=heath130&gt;Heathcote, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; He supported [[Frederic Charles Dreyer|F. C. Dreyer]]'s improvements in gunnery [[fire-control system]]s, and favoured the adoption of Dreyer's &quot;Fire Control Table&quot;, a form of mechanical computer for calculating firing solutions for warships.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Jellicoe arranged for the output of naval ordnance to be transferred from the War Office to the Admiralty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grigg 2002, p371-2&quot;&gt;Grigg 2002, p371-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Jellicoe was appointed second-in-command of the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] in August 1907, hoisting his flag in the battleship {{HMS|Albemarle|1901|6}}.&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt; He was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] on the occasion of [[Edward VII|the King]]'s Review of the [[Home Fleet]] in the [[Solent]] on 3 August 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28048 |date=6 August 1907 |startpage=5390|supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to be [[Third Sea Lord|Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy]] in October 1908 and, having taken part in the funeral of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] in May 1910,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28401 |date=26 July 1910 |startpage=5481|supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet]] in December 1910, hoisting his flag in the battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|1902|6}}.&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt; He advanced to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] on the Coronation of [[George V|King George V]] on 19 June 1911 and confirmed in the rank of [[vice admiral]] on 18 September 1911.&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt; He went on to be Second-in-Command of the [[Home Fleet]], hoisting his flag in the battleship {{HMS|Hercules|1910|6}}, in December 1911 and, having also been appointed commander of the [[2nd Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Battle Squadron]] in May 1912, joined an inquiry into the supply and storage of [[liquid fuels]] in peace and war on 1 August 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28632 |date=2 August 1912 |startpage=5721|supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[Second Sea Lord]] in December 1912.&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt;

==First World War==
===Grand Fleet===
At the start of the [[First World War]], the First Lord of the Admiralty [[Winston Churchill]], removed Admiral [[George Callaghan]], Commander-in-Chief of the [[Home Fleet]]&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt; (August 1914). Jellicoe was promoted to full [[admiral]] on 4 August 1914 and assigned command of the renamed [[Grand Fleet]] in Admiral Callaghan's place, though he was appalled by the treatment of his predecessor.&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt; He was advanced to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] on 8 February 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 29066 |date= 12 February 1915|startpage= 1443 |supp= |accessdate= 1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Fisher (First Sea Lord) and Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty) both had to leave office (May 1915) after their quarrel over the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Dardanelles]], Jellicoe wrote to Fisher: “We owe you a debt of gratitude for having saved the Navy from a continuance in office of Mr Churchill, and I hope that never again will any politician be allowed to usurp the functions that he took upon himself to exercise”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grigg 2002, p371-2&quot;/&gt;

Jellicoe commanded the British Grand Fleet at the [[Battle of Jutland]] in May 1916, the largest (and only major) clash of [[dreadnought]]s, albeit an indecisive one.&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt; His handling of the Grand Fleet during the battle remains controversial, with some historians characterising Jellicoe as too cautious and other historians faulting the [[battlecruiser]] commander, Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]], for making various tactical errors.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, p. 232-237&lt;/ref&gt; Jellicoe certainly made no significant mistakes during the battle: based on limited intelligence, he correctly deployed the Grand Fleet with a turn to port so as to &quot;[[Crossing the T|cross the T]]&quot; of the German [[High Seas Fleet]] as it appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p. 621&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering heavy damage from shells, the German fleet turned 180 degrees and headed away from the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p. 645&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the British public expressed disappointment that the Royal Navy had not won a victory on the scale of the 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]].&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt; Churchill described Jellicoe later as &quot;the only man on either side who could lose the war in an afternoon&quot;—essentially hinting that Jellicoe's decision to prefer caution was strategically correct.&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt; Nevertheless, he was appointed a member of the [[Order of Merit]] on 31 May 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 29751 |date= 15 September 1916 |startpage= 9070 |supp= yes|accessdate= 1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]] on 17 June 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 29629 |date= 20 June 1916 |startpage= 6063 |supp= yes|accessdate= 1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded the Grand Cross of the French [[Legion of Honour]] on 15 September 1916.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Sea Lord===
[[File:John Rushworth Jellicoe.jpg|thumb|A 1935 portrait of Jellicoe by [[Reginald Grenville Eves]].]]
Jellicoe was appointed [[First Sea Lord]] in November 1916.&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt; His term of office role saw Britain brought within danger of starvation by German [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|unrestricted U-Boat warfare]].&lt;ref name=heath131&gt;Heathcote, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

At the War Committee (a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1915–16) in November 1916, the admirals present, including Jellicoe, told [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] that convoys presented too large a target for enemy ships, and that merchant ship masters lacked the discipline to “keep station” in a convoy. In February 1917, [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]] wrote a memorandum for Lloyd George calling for the introduction of “scientifically organised convoys”, almost certainly after being persuaded by Commander [[Reginald Henderson|Henderson]] and the Shipping Ministry officials with whom he was in contact. After a breakfast meeting (13 February 1917) with Lloyd George, [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Carson]] (First Lord of the Admiralty) and Admirals Jellicoe and [[Alexander Ludovic Duff|Duff]] agreed to “conduct experiments”. However, convoys were not in general use until August 1917, by which time shipping losses to U-boats were already falling from their April peak.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, p49, 51, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Jellicoe continued to take a pessimistic view, advising the War Policy Committee (a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1917) during planning meetings for the Third Ypres Offensive in June and July that nothing could be done to defeat the [[U-boat]]s. However, removing Jellicoe in July, as Lloyd George wanted, would have been politically impossible given Conservative anger at the return of [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] (still blamed for the Dardanelles) to office as [[Minister of Munitions]]. In August and September Lloyd George was preoccupied with Third Ypres and the possible transfer of resources to Italy, whilst the new First Lord of the Admiralty, [[Eric Campbell Geddes|Sir Eric Campbell Geddes]], was reforming the Naval Staff (including creating a post for [[Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss|Wemyss]] as Deputy First Sea Lord). Geddes and Lloyd George met with [[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]] and [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Carson]] (both former [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|First Lords of the Admiralty]]) on 26 October to discuss sacking Jellicoe after he had failed to act on “secret, but absolutely reliable” information about a German attack on a Norwegian convoy, but again nothing came of this as Lloyd George was soon preoccupied by the [[Battle of Caporetto]] and the setting up of the [[Supreme War Council]]. Geddes wanted to return to his previous job in charge of military transportation in France, and by December it was clear that Lloyd George would have to sack Jellicoe or lose Geddes.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, p373&lt;/ref&gt;

Jellicoe was rather abruptly dismissed by Geddes in December 1917.&lt;ref 
name=heath131&gt;Heathcote, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Before he left for leave on Christmas Eve he received a letter from Geddes demanding his resignation. Geddes’ letter stated that he was still in the building and available to talk, but after consulting [[Lionel Halsey|Admiral Halsey]] Jellicoe replied in writing that he would “do what was best for the service”. The move became public knowledge two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, p371-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christmas holiday, when Parliament was not sitting, provided a good opportunity to remove Jellicoe with a minimum of fuss. Geddes squared matters with the King and with the Grand Fleet commander Admiral Beatty (who had initially written to Jellicoe of his “dismay” over his sacking and promised to speak to Geddes, but then did not write to him again for a month) over the holiday. The other Sea Lords talked of resigning (although Jellicoe advised them not to do so), especially when Geddes suggested in a meeting (31 December) that Balfour and Carson had specifically recommended Jellicoe’s removal at the 26 October meeting; they had not done so, although Balfour’s denial was less than emphatic. There was no trouble from the generals, who had a low opinion of Jellicoe. In the end the Sea Lords remained in place, whilst Carson remained a member of the War Cabinet, resigning in January over Irish Home Rule.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, p374-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was pretended that the decision had been Geddes’ alone, he let slip in the Naval Estimates debate (6 March 1918) that he had been conveying “the decision of the Government”, i.e. of Lloyd George, who had never put the matter to the War Cabinet. MPs picked up on his slip immediately, and [[Andrew Bonar Law|Bonar Law]] (Conservative Leader) admitted in the same debate that he too had had prior knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, p374&lt;/ref&gt;

As First Sea Lord Jellicoe was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Belgian [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]] on 21 April 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30029|date=20 April 1917 |startpage=3821 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Russian [[Order of St. George]], 3rd Class on 5 June 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30116|date=5 June 1917 |startpage=5591 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Grand Cross of the Italian [[Military Order of Savoy]] on 11 August 1917&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30227|date=10 August 1917 |startpage=8208 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Grand Cordon of the Japanese [[Order of the Rising Sun]] on 29 August 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30258|date=29 August 1917 |startpage=8989 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later war===
Jellicoe was created '''Viscount Jellicoe''' of Scapa Flow on 7 March 1918&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30565|date=8 March 1918 |startpage=2989 |supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1918, amidst concerns that—following the [[Treaty of Brest Litovsk]]—the Germans were about to requisition the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]], Lloyd George proposed Jellicoe as Allied Supreme Naval Commander in the Mediterranean. The French were in favour of a combined Allied naval command, but the Italians were not, so nothing came of the suggestion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grigg 2002, p372&quot;&gt;Grigg 2002, p372&lt;/ref&gt;

Jellicoe was promoted to [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] on 3 April 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31327|date=6 May 1919|startpage=5653|supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] in September 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31983|date=16 July 1920 |startpage=7577 |supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while out there also served as Grand Master of New Zealand's Masonic Grand Lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons.co.nz/cms/misc/grand-masters/|title=Grand Master &amp; Past Grand Masters|publisher=The New Zealand Freemasons |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return to England, he was created '''Earl Jellicoe''' and '''Viscount Brocas''' of [[Southampton]] in the County of Southampton on 1 July 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33063|date=3 July 1925|startpage=4448 |supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[pneumonia]] at his home in [[Kensington]] in [[London]] on 20 November 1935 and was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=heath131/&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1919, &quot;Sleep, beneath the wave! a requiem&quot; with words by Rev. Alfred Hall and Music by Albert Ham. was &quot;Dedicated to Admiral Viscount Jellicoe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sleep, beneath the wave! a requiem&quot; with words by Rev. Alfred Hall and Music by Albert Ham. Winnipeg, Manitoba: Waley, Royce and Co., 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt of his official biographer, Admiral [[Reginald Bacon]], to portray him as the conqueror of the U-Boats is, in [[John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham|John Grigg]]'s view, absurd, as the main decisions were taken by other men. Bacon also claimed that his elevation to a viscountcy on dismissal was a deliberate snub, but in fact [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]], the former Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, was only a viscount at the time (both he and Jellicoe became Earls subsequently), whilst [[John Arbuthnot Fisher|Fisher]] was never more than a Baron. Bacon's neutrality may be questionable as he had himself been sacked by Geddes from command of the [[Dover Patrol]], replaced by [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Roger Keyes]], shortly after Jellicoe’s removal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grigg 2002, p372&quot;/&gt;

==Family==
[[File:Bust of Jellicoe in Trafalgar Square.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bust in [[Trafalgar Square]].]]
Jellicoe married, at [[Holy Trinity, Sloane Street|Holy Trinity church, Sloane Street]] on 1 July 1902, Florence Gwendoline Cayzer, daughter of the shipping magnate [[Sir Charles Cayzer, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Cayzer]]. His brother Rev. Frederick Jellicoe (1858–1927) conducted the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=2 July 1902 |page_number=10 |issue=36809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord and Lady Jellicoe had a son and five daughters.&lt;ref name=heath129/&gt;
