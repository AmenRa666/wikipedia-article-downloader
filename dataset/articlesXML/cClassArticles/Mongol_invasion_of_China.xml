The '''Mongol invasion of China''' was a series of major military efforts by the [[Mongols]] to invade [[China]]. It spanned six decades in the 13th century and involved the defeat of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], [[Western Xia]], the [[Dali Kingdom]] and the [[Southern Song]]. The [[Mongol Empire]] under [[Genghis Khan]] started the conquest with small-scale raids into Western Xia in 1205 and 1207.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imperialchina.org/Xi-Xia.html&lt;/ref&gt; By 1279, the Mongol leader [[Kublai Khan]] had established the [[Yuan dynasty]] in China and crushed the last Song resistance, which marked the onset of all of China under the Mongol Yuan rule. This was the first time in history that the whole of China was [[Conquest dynasties|conquered]] and subsequently ruled by a foreign or non-native ruler,&lt;ref&gt;Hugh D. Walker &quot;Traditional Sino-Korean Diplomatic Relations : A Realistic Historical Appraisal&quot;, ''Monumenta Serica'', Vol. 24 (1965), pp. 155-16, (p.159)&lt;/ref&gt; compared with the [[Manchu]]s (who established the [[Qing dynasty]]) who did so a few centuries later.

== Conquest of Western Xia ==
{{Main article|Mongol conquest of Western Xia}}

In the late 1190s and early 1200s, Temujin, soon to be [[Genghis Khan]], began consolidating his power in Mongolia. Following the death of the [[Khereid|Kerait]] leader [[Ong Khan]] to Temujin's emerging [[Mongol Empire]] in 1203, Keriat leader Nilqa Senggum led a small band of followers into [[Western Xia]], also known as Xi-Xia.&lt;ref name=&quot;tim may 1211&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=May|first=Timothy|title=The Mongol Conquests in World History|year=2012|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|location=London|isbn=9781861899712|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRIt9sZaTREC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=1211}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after his adherents took to plundering the locals, Nilqa Senggum was expelled from Western Xia territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;tim may 1211&quot; /&gt;

Using his rival Nilga Senggum's temporary refuge in Western Xia as a pretext, Temujin launched a raid against the state in 1205 in the [[Khara-Khoto|Edsin]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;tim may 1211&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.

Bor ''Mongol hiigeed Eurasiin diplomat shashtir'', vol.II, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, 1206, Temujin was formally proclaimed Genghis Khan, ruler of all the Mongols, marking the official start of the Mongol Empire. In 1207, Genghis led another raid into Western Xia, invading the [[Ordos Loop|Ordo region]] and sacking [[Wulahai]], the main garrison along the [[Yellow River]], before withdrawing in 1208.&lt;ref name=&quot;hartog 59&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rossabi |first=William |title=Genghis Khan and the Mongol empire |year=2009 |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |location=Seattle |isbn=9622178359 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1209, the Genghis undertook a larger campaign to secure the submission of Western Xia. After defeating a force led by Kao Liang-Hui outside Wulahai, Genghis captured the city and pushed up along the Yellow River, defeated several cities, and besieged the capital, [[Yinchuan]], which held a well-fortified garrison of 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford ''Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World'', p.85&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongols, at this point inexperienced at siege warfare, attempted to flood out the city by diverting the Yellow River, but the dike they built to accomplish this broke and flooded the Mongol camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;tim may 1211&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, Emperor [[Li Anquan]], still threatened by the Mongols and receiving no relief from the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], agreed to submit to Mongol rule, and demonstrated his loyalty by giving a daughter, Chaka, in marriage to Genghis and paying a tribute of camels, falcons, and textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|authorlink=John Man (author)|title=Genghis Khan: Life, Death, and Resurrection|year=2004|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|isbn=9780312366247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXTv9a0HZakC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=death#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their defeat in 1210, Western Xia served as faithful vassals to the Mongol Empire for almost a decade, aiding the Mongols in their [[Mongol–Jin War|war against the Jin dynasty]]. In 1219, Genghis Khan launched his [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|campaign against the Khwarazmian dynasty]] in [[Central Asia]], and requested military aid from Western Xia. However, the emperor and his military commander Asha refused to take part in the campaign, stating that if Genghis had too few troops to attack [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazm]], then he had no claim to supreme power.&lt;ref name=kohn&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohn|first=George C.|title=Dictionary of Wars|year=2007|edition=3rd|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York City|isbn=9781438129167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIzreCGlHxIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|authorlink=John Man (author)|title=Genghis Khan: Life, Death, and Resurrection|year=2004|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|isbn=9780312366247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXTv9a0HZakC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=death#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infuriated, Genghis swore vengeance and left to invade Khwarazm, while Western Xia attempted alliances with the Jin and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties against the Mongols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebrey&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia Buckley |title=East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2012|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|location=[[Stamford, Connecticut]] |isbn=9781133606475 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ou-hq_FlQY4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |edition=3rd |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After defeating Khwarazm in 1221, Genghis prepared his armies to punish Western Xia for their betrayal, and in 1225 he attacked with a force of approximately 180,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;china at war&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Genghis Khan |year=2012 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jhPyvsdymU8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |editor=Li, Xiaobing |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|location=[[Santa Barbara, California]] |isbn=9781598844153 |last = Emmons|first = James B.|work = China at War: An Encyclopedia|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking [[Khara-Khoto]], the Mongols began a steady advance southward.

{{Main article|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}

One of the major goals of Genghis Khan was the conquest of the Jin dynasty, allowing the [[Mongols]] to avenge the earlier death of a Mongol Khan, gain the riches of northern China and to establish the Mongols as a major power in the East-Asian world.

Genghis Khan declared war in 1211, and while Mongols were victorious in the field, they were frustrated in their efforts to take major cities. In his typically logical and determined fashion, Genghis and his highly developed staff studied the problems of the [[assault]] of fortifications. With the help of Chinese engineers, they gradually developed the techniques to take down fortifications. [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Islamic engineers]] joined later and especially contributed counterweight [[trebuchet]]s, &quot;Muslim phao&quot;, which had a maximum range of 300 meters compared to 150 meters of the ancient Chinese predecessor. It played a significant role in taking the Chinese strongholds and was as well used against infantry units on the battlefield. This eventually would make troops under the Mongols some of the most accomplished and most successful [[besiegers]] in the history of warfare.

As a result of a number of overwhelming victories in the field and a few successes in the capture of fortifications deep within China, Genghis had conquered and consolidated Jin territory as far south as the [[Great Wall]] by 1213. He then advanced with three armies into the heart of Jin territory, between the Great Wall and the [[Yellow River]]. With the help of Chenyu Liu, one of the top officers who betrayed Jin, as well as the Southern Song, who wanted revenge on Jin, Genghis defeated the Jin forces, devastated northern China, captured numerous cities, and in 1215 besieged, captured and [[Looting|sacked]] the Jin capital of [[Yanjing]] (modern-day Beijing). However, the Jin emperor, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Xuan Zong]], did not surrender, but moved his capital to [[Kaifeng]]. The city fell in the [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|siege of Kaifeng]] in 1232. [[Emperor Aizong of Jin|Emperor Aizong]] fled to the town of Caizhou. The dynasty collapsed after the [[siege of Caizhou]] in 1234.

== Conquest of Dali Kingdom ==
[[Möngke Khan]] dispatched [[Kublai]] to the [[Dali Kingdom]] in 1253 to outflank the Song. The Gao family, dominated the court, resisted and murdered Mongol [[diplomat|envoy]]s. The Mongols divided their forces into three. One wing rode eastward into the [[Sichuan]] basin. The second column under Uryankhadai took a difficult way into the mountains of western Sichuan.&lt;ref&gt;John Man ''Kublai Khan'', p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai himself headed south over the grasslands, meeting up with the first column. While Uryankhadai galloping in along the lakeside from the north, Kublai took the capital city of Dali and spared the residents despite the slaying of his ambassadors. The Dali King Duan Xingzhi ([[w:zh:段興智|段興智]]) himself defected to the Mongols, who used his troops to conquer the rest of Yunnan. The Mongols appointed King Duan Xingzhi as Maharajah and stationed a pacification commissioner there.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Atwood ''Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongols'', p.613&lt;/ref&gt; After Kublai's departure, unrest broke out among the Black Jang (one of the main ethnic groups of the Dali kingdom). By 1256, Uryankhadai, the son of [[Subutai]] had completely pacified [[Yunnan]].

Against the Alans and the Cumans (Kipchaks), the Mongols used divide and conquer tactics:  first the Mongols told the Cumans to stop allying with the Alans and then, after the Cumans followed their suggestion, the Mongols defeated the Alans&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, Charles J.. 2000. “The Kipchak Connection: The Ilkhans, the Mamluks and Ayn Jalut”.

== Conquest of Southern Song ==
{{Main article|Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty}}
{{Campaignbox Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty}}

At first, the Mongols allied with Song China as both had a common enemy in the form of Jin. However, this alliance broke down with the destruction of Jur'chen Jin in 1234. After Song forces captured the former Chinese capitals of Luoyang, Chang'an and Kaifeng from the Mongols and after the Song had killed a Mongol [[ambassador]], the Mongols declared war. Very soon, the Mongol armies had forced the Song back to the Yangtze, and the two sides would be engaged in a four-decade war until the fall of the Song in 1276.

The Mongol force which invaded southern China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the Middle East in 1256.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/606298 Smith, Jr. 1998], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Mongol forces had success against the non-[[Han Chinese]] ruled states of the Jin and Xia, conquering the Song took much more time. The Song forces were equipped with the best technology available at the time, such as an ample supply of gunpowder weapons like [[fire lance]]s, [[Rocket#In antiquity|rocket]]s and [[flamethrower]]s. However, intrigues at the Song court would favour the Mongols. The fierce resistance of the Song forces resulted in the Mongols having to fight the most difficult war in all of their conquests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?ei=1AfUTtfIIqbf0QHY-ukW&amp;ct=result&amp;id=OgQXAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Chinese+resilient+foes |title=The Mongol Warlords: Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan, Hulegu, Tamerlane  |author1=David Nicolle |author2=Richard Hook |accessdate=2011-11-28  |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |date= |year=1998 |month= |publisher=Brockhampton Press |location= |language= |isbn=1-86019-407-9 |page=57 |pages= |quote=For his part Kublai dedicated himself totally to the task, but it was still to be the Mongol's thoughest war.

After several indecisive wars, the Mongols unsuccessfully attacked the Song garrison at [[Diaoyu Fortress]] [[Hechuan]] when their [[Great Khan]], Möngke, died of [[cholera]] or [[dysentery]]. However, the general responsible for this defence was not rewarded and instead punished by the Song court. Discouraged, he defected to the Mongols. He suggested to Möngke's successor, Kublai, that the key to the conquest of Song was the capture of [[Xiangyang District, Xiangfan|Xiangyang]], a vital Song stronghold.

[[File:Yuan Dynasty 1294.png|thumb|right|250px|The [[Yuan dynasty]] under Kublai Khan after the conquest of Southern Song dynasty.]]
The Mongols quickly enclosed Xiangyang and defeated any attempt to reinforce it by the Song.
After a siege that lasted several years, and with the help of [[Muslim]] artillery created by [[Iraq]]i engineers, the Mongols finally forced the city of Xiangyang to surrender. The dying Song dynasty sent its armies against the Mongols at Yehue under the incompetent chancellor Jia Sidao. Predictably, the battle was a disaster. Running out of troops and supplies, the Song court surrendered to the Mongols in 1276.

With the desire to rule all of China, Kublai established the [[Yuan dynasty]] and became [[Emperor of China]]. However, despite the surrender of the Song court, resistance of the Song remnants remained. Chinese resistance lasted for a few more years. Song loyalists organized themselves around a powerless boy emperor, brother to the last formal Song emperor. The final confrontation took place off the water of modern Hong Kong in 1279, where the Mongol army had forced the Song out into the sea onto Song warships. In an attempt to restore the Song dynasty, several Song officials set up a government in [[Guangdong]], aboard the vast Song navy, which still maintained over a thousand ships. Realizing this, Kublai sent his fleet to engage the Song fleet at the [[battle of Yamen]] in 1279, winning a decisive victory in which the last Song [[Emperor Bing of Song]] and his loyal officials committed suicide.

Members of the Song Imperial Family continued to live in the Yuan dynasty like [[Emperor Gong of Song]], [[Zhao Mengfu]], and [[Zhao Yong]]. Zhao Mengfu painted at the Yuan court and was personally interviewed by Kublai Khan. This practice was referred to as [[w:zh:二王三恪|二王三恪]].

==Chinese resistance in Vietnam against the Mongols==

The Chinese region of [[Fujian]] was the original home of the Chinese Tran (Chen) clan before they migrated under Trần Kinh (陳京, Chén Jīng) to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the [[Trần dynasty]] which ruled Vietnam (Đại Việt), and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a [[Yuan dynasty]] envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Trần prince Trần Quốc Tuấn (later King [[Trần Hưng Đạo]]) in 1282.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=K.

Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion. The Tran dynasty originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as &quot;Northern bandits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/giac-bac-den-xam-luoc-translations-and-exclamation-points/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;proof that he runs the blog&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141014090118/http://manoa.hawaii.edu/history/node/44 proof that he runs the blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tran defeated the [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam]].
