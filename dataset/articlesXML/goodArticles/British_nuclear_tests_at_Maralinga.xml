'''British nuclear tests at Maralinga''' occurred between 1956 and 1963 at the [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]] site, part of the [[Woomera Prohibited Area]] in [[South Australia]] and about 800 kilometres north-west of [[Adelaide]]. A total of seven [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] were performed, with [[Nuclear weapon yield|approximate yields]] ranging from {{convert|1|to|27|ktTNT|lk=on}}. Two major test series were conducted at the Maralinga site: ''Operation Buffalo'' and ''Operation Antler''. The site was also used for hundreds of minor trials, many of which were intended to investigate the effects of fire or non-nuclear explosions on atomic weapons.

The site was contaminated with [[radioactive waste|radioactive materials]] and an initial cleanup was attempted in 1967. The [[McClelland Royal Commission]], an examination of the effects of the tests, delivered its report in 1985, and found that significant radiation hazards still existed at many of the Maralinga test areas.  It recommended another cleanup, which was completed in 2000 at a cost of $108 million. Debate continued over the safety of the site and the long-term health effects on the traditional [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] owners of the land and former personnel. In 1994, the Australian Government paid compensation amounting to $13.5 million to the local [[Maralinga Tjarutja]] people.

The Maralinga tests were subject to extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some journalists investigated the subject and political scrutiny became more intense. Journalist [[Brian Toohey]] ran a series of stories in the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.&lt;ref name=ltynan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foe.org.au/dig-secrets-lesson-maralingas-vixen-b |title=Dig for secrets: the lesson of Maralinga's Vixen B |author=Liz Tynan |date=November 2013 |work=Chain Reaction #119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1993, ''[[New Scientist]]'' journalist Ian Anderson wrote an article titled &quot;Britain's dirty deeds at Maralinga&quot; and several related articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Jones&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/apr/05/guardianobituaries3  |title=Ian Anderson obituary |author=Philip Jones |date=5 April 2000 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, ''[[Maralinga: Australia's Nuclear Waste Cover-up]]'' by [[Alan Parkinson (engineer)|Alan Parkinson]] documented the unsuccessful clean-up at  Maralinga.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au&quot;&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/ockhamsrazor/maralinga---australias-nuclear-waste-cover-up/3221322 Maralinga - Australia's nuclear waste cover-up]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuclear waste and indigenous rights&quot;&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/perspective/dr-jim-green/3284602 Nuclear waste and indigenous rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;greenleft.org.au&quot;&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.au/2007/730/37829  Maralinga's nuclear nightmare continues] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307102555/http://www.greenleft.org.au/2007/730/37829 |date=7 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular songs about the Maralinga story have been written by [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], [[Midnight Oil]], [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (album)|Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe]] and [[Alistair Hulett]].

==Historical context==
On 3 October 1952, the United Kingdom tested its first nuclear weapon, named &quot;[[Operation Hurricane|Hurricane]]&quot;, at the [[Monte Bello Islands]] off the coast of [[Western Australia]].  A year later the first nuclear test on the Australian mainland was ''[[Totem 1]]'' ({{convert|9.1|ktTNT}}) at [[Emu Field]] in the [[Great Victoria Desert]], South Australia, on 15 October 1953. ''[[Totem 2]]'' ({{convert|7.1|ktTNT}}) followed two weeks later on 27 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;modkey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121026065214/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/470D247F-7615-460C-9829-DDAF99F88D39/0/Key_Events.pdf |title=Key events in the UK atmospheric nuclear test programme |publisher=UK Ministry of Defence |accessdate=27 June 2009 |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supply Minister, Howard Beale, stated in 1955 that &quot;England has the know how; we have the open spaces, much technical skill and a great willingness to help the Motherland. Between us we should help to build the defences of the free world, and make historic advances in harnessing the forces of nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p72191/pdf/article106.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government formally requested a permanent test facility on 30 October 1953. Due to concerns about [[nuclear fallout]] from the previous tests at Emu Field and the site's inadequate infrastructure and water supply, the recently surveyed Maralinga site was selected for this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;fedmeteor&quot;&gt;Atomic Weapons Tests in: {{cite web | url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/fam/1042.html | title=Federation and Meteorology | accessdate=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new site was announced in May 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;modkey&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dateuncertainty&quot;&gt;Sources give slightly varying dates for the request and selection of the site.&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed as a joint, co-funded facility between the British and Australian governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;natarchive&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs129.aspx | title=Fact sheet 129: British nuclear tests at Maralinga | accessdate=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to selection, the Maralinga site was inhabited by the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] and [[Yankunytjatjara]] [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] people, for whom it had a great spiritual significance. Many were relocated to a new settlement at [[Yalata, South Australia|Yalata]], and attempts were made to curtail access to the Maralinga site. These were often unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;grabosky&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/lcj/wayward/ch16.html |first=P N |last=Grabosky |title=Wayward governance : illegality and its control in the public sector |publisher=Australian Institute of Criminology |location=Canberra |isbn=0-642-14605-5 |pages=235â€“253 |accessdate=27 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728180259/http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/lcj/wayward/ch16.html |archivedate=28 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{GeoGroup|article=British nuclear tests at Maralinga#Operation Buffalo}}

'''''Operation Buffalo''''' commenced on 27 September 1956. The operation consisted of the testing of four nuclear devices, codenamed ''One Tree'', ''Marcoo'', ''Kite'' and ''Breakaway'' respectively. ''One Tree'' ({{convert|12.9|ktTNT}}) and ''Breakaway'' ({{convert|10.8|ktTNT}}) were exploded from towers, ''Marcoo'' ({{convert|1.4|ktTNT}}) was exploded at ground level, and ''Kite'' ({{convert|2.9|ktTNT}}) was released by a [[Royal Air Force]] [[Vickers Valiant]] bomber from a height of {{convert|35,000|ft}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;sed&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/bsv/nuclear_explosions/great_britain.html | publisher=[[Swiss Seismological Service]] | title=Nuclear Explosions from Great Britain 1945â€“1998 | date=5 February 2003 | accessdate=27 June 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080206002959/http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/bsv/nuclear_explosions/great_britain.html |archivedate = 6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yieldnote&quot;&gt;Some sources quote different yields. For example, Parkinson (MAPW 2000) states that their yields were 15&amp;nbsp;kt, 10&amp;nbsp;kt, 1.5&amp;nbsp;kt and 3&amp;nbsp;kt respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thunder&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/valiant/history.html | title=Vickers Valiant: History | accessdate=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was the first British launching of a nuclear weapon from an aircraft.

The fallout from these tests was measured using sticky paper, air sampling devices, and water sampled from rainfall and reservoirs.&lt;ref&gt;Atomic Weapons Testsâ€“Buffalo 1, 2, 3 and 4 in: {{cite web | url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/fam/1047.html | title=Federation and Meteorology | accessdate=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radioactive cloud from ''Buffalo 1 (One Tree)'' reached a height of {{convert|37500|ft|abbr=on}}, exceeding the predicted {{convert|27,900|ft|abbr=on}}, and radioactivity was detected in South Australia, Northern Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland. All four ''Buffalo'' tests were criticised by the 1985 [[McClelland Royal Commission]], which concluded that they were fired under inappropriate conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;royal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/guides/titt/22.htm | title=Summary of findings of the Royal Commission | accessdate=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Dr Sue Rabbit Roff, a researcher from the [[University of Dundee]], uncovered documentary evidence that troops had been ordered to run, walk and crawl across areas contaminated by the Buffalo tests in the days immediately following the detonations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s295331.htm | title=Evidence uncovered about Maralinga experiment | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=11 May 2006 | accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fact that the British government later admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1326580.stm  | title=Australia confronts UK over N-tests | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | date=12 May 2006 | accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Roff stated that &quot;it puts the lie to the British government's claim that they never used humans for guinea pig-type experiments in nuclear weapons trials in Australia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s294575.htm | title=Maralinga revelations | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=11 May 2006 | accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minor tests==

In addition to the major tests, a large number of minor trials were also carried out, from June 1955 and extended through to April 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;modkey&quot; /&gt; Although the major tests had been carried out with some publicity, the minor tests were carried out in absolute secrecy.&lt;ref name=&quot;keane&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/11/1052280486255.html | first=John | last=Keane | title=Maralinga's afterlife | publisher=The Age | date=11 May 2003 | accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These minor tests left a dangerous legacy of radioactive contamination at Maralinga.&lt;ref name=&quot;radwaste&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radioactivewaste.gov.au/Rehabilitation_former_test_sites.htm | title=Maralinga rehabilitation project | publisher=Australian Department of Education, Science and Training | accessdate=2 December 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080719004540/http://www.radioactivewaste.gov.au/Rehabilitation_former_test_sites.htm |archivedate = 19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=green&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.au/1995/196/11520 Maralinga: nuclear testing in Australia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008223855/http://www.greenleft.org.au/1995/196/11520 |date=8 October 2007 }} ''Green Left'', 2 August 1995.

The four series of minor trials were codenamed ''''Kittens'''', ''''Tims'''', ''''Rats'''' and ''''Vixen''''.&lt;ref name=&quot;keane&quot; /&gt; In all, these trials included up to 700 tests, with tests involving experiments with [[plutonium]], [[uranium]], and [[beryllium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ratical&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Rondon | first=A | title=Poison Fire, Sacred Earth:  Testimonies, Lectures, Conclusions.

The ''Vixen'' minor trials (Vixen A and Vixen B) were formulated to investigate what would happen to a nuclear device which burnt or was subject to a non-nuclear explosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;keane&quot; /&gt; 31 ''Vixen A'' trials between 1959 and 1961 investigated the effects of an accidental fire on a nuclear weapon, and involved a total of about 1&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium.&lt;ref name=&quot;famminor&quot;&gt;Atomic Weapons Testsâ€”Minor Trials in: {{cite web | url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/fam/1051.html | title=Federation and Meteorology | accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve Vixen B trials, between 1960 and 1963, attempted to discover the effects of high explosives detonating a nuclear weapon in a fire (typical of conditions which would occur in aviation accidents) and involved 22&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium.&lt;ref name=&quot;famminor&quot; /&gt; They produced &quot;jets of molten, burning plutonium extending hundreds of feet into the air.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;arpansa&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arpansa.gov.au//pubs/basics/maralinga.pdf | archiveurl=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20080831115407/http://arpansa.gov.au//pubs/basics/maralinga.pdf | archivedate=2008-08-31 | title=Maralinga | publisher=Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency | accessdate=2 December 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the lack of subsequent disposal of the plutonium from these minor trials â€“ ''Vixen B'' especially â€“ which created the major radiation problems at the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;arpansa&quot; /&gt;

The ''Vixen'' experimental tests used TNT to blow up simulated nuclear warheads containing [[plutonium-239]]. In total, ''Vixen B'' scattered 22.2&amp;nbsp;kg of [[plutonium]] around the Maralinga test site known as Taranaki, in particles of widely divergent size. [[Plutonium#Toxicity|Plutonium is not particularly dangerous externally]] - it emits [[alpha particles]] which are stopped by {{convert|9|cm|abbr=on}} of air, or the dead layer of skin cells on the body, and is not a very intensive source of radiation, due to its long [[half-life]] of 24,000 years. It is most dangerous when it enters the body, in the worst case by breathing, and therefore tiny particles, often the result of such explosion testing, are the worst threat.  The extreme biological persistence of plutonium's [[radioactive contamination]] and the cancer threat posed by alpha radiation occurring internally together establish plutonium's dangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michio|last1=Kaku|first2=Jennifer|last2=Trainer|title=Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology|publisher=W.

In terms of regular nuclear testing, ''Kittens'' represents bomb component testing, while ''Tims'' and ''Rats'' were early subcritical hydronuclear tests.  ''Vixen'' is [[Subcritical testing|&quot;safety testing&quot;]] of a bomb; assuring that the core would not accidentally undergo criticality in the event of a fire or unintended crash. These are always messy (see the US equivalent at Plutonium Valley in [[Project 56 (nuclear test)|Project 56]]), for a successful test subjects the core fuel to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. The differences in the sort of dangers presented by major vs the minor tests is that there was no critical explosion in the minor tests.  In the major tests, the bomb cores reached critical mass; the plutonium or uranium fissile materials &quot;burned&quot; into highly radioactive fission products, and those, along with the unspent fuel and activated bomb case, tower and soil if the explosion was close to the ground, are lofted into the stratosphere to be dropped eventually as fallout globally. In ''Vixen'', an equivalent amount of plutonium fuel was simply smashed by explosives and spread about much more locally.  In ''Kittens'', ''Tims'' and ''Rats'', smaller amounts of various materials were similar exploded locally and spread about.

==Legacy==

In the 1950s, [[Hedley Marston]]'s research into [[nuclear fallout]] from the Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter conflict with the Australian government appointed Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. He was vindicated posthumously by the [[McClelland Royal Commission]], which found that significant radiation hazards existed at many of the Maralinga test sites long after the tests. His project tracked fallout across the continent by examining the thyroids of sheep and cattle as well as devices that filtered radioactive elements from air. Later the results, which showed dramatic increases of certain radioactive elements after British Nuclear Tests, caused a further, controversial study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for [[strontium-90]]. These tests showed that the tests had increased the concentration of strontium-90 dramatically. As well as finding this after British tests a notable 50% increase was noticed one year when there were no tests and it was cited as evidence that the previous year's hydrogen bomb tests had contaminated the majority of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discontents.com.au/words/review_fallout.php Book Review: &quot;Fallout: Hedley Marston and the British bomb tests in Australia&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019172546/http://www.discontents.com.au/words/review_fallout.php |date=19 October 2006 }}, by Tim Sherratt, ''Historical Records of Australian Science'', vol. 14, no. 2, November 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;209â€“10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Maralinga cleanup operation codenamed ''[[Operation Brumby]]'' was conducted in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;modkey&quot; /&gt; Attempts were made to dilute the concentration of radioactive material by turning over and mixing the surface soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;arpansa&quot; /&gt; Additionally, the remains of the firings, including plutonium-contaminated fragments, were buried in 22 concrete-capped pits.&lt;ref name=&quot;arpansa&quot; /&gt;

In the 1970s, whistle-blower [[Avon Hudson]] disclosed details of the Maralinga testing program to the Australian media at risk of incarceration. His disclosures related to the inadequacy of clean-up measures, persistent contamination and associated health risks of [[ionizing radiation]]. Hudson gave testimony to the [[Royal Commission into British nuclear tests in Australia]] in 1984 and 1985 and has since continued to work as a spokesperson for nuclear veterans in South Australia.

The [[McClelland Royal Commission]] into the tests delivered its report in late 1985, and found that significant radiation hazards still existed at many of the Maralinga test sites, particularly at ''Taranaki'',&lt;ref name=&quot;radwaste&quot; /&gt; where the ''Vixen B'' trials into the effects of burning [[plutonium]] had been carried out. A Technical Assessment Group was set up to advise on rehabilitation options, and a much more extensive cleanup program was initiated at the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;arpansa&quot; /&gt;

The ''TAG Report'' plan was approved in 1991 and work commenced on site in 1996 and was completed in 2000 at a cost of $108 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;radwaste&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Broinowski (2003). ''Fact or Fission: The Truth About Australia's Nuclear Ambitions'', Scribe Publications, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In the worst-contaminated areas, 350,000 cubic metres of soil and debris were removed from an area of more than 2 square kilometres, and buried in trenches. Eleven debris pits were also treated with in-situ [[Radioactive waste#Vitrification|vitrification]]. Most of the site (approximately 3,200 square kilometres) is now safe for unrestricted access and approximately 120 square kilometres is considered safe for access but not permanent occupancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;radwaste&quot; /&gt;  [[Alan Parkinson (engineer)|Alan Parkinson]] has observed that &quot;an Aboriginal living a semi-traditional lifestyle would receive an effective dose of 5 mSv/a (five times that allowed for a member of the public). Within the 120&amp;nbsp;kmÂ², the effective dose would be up to 13 times greater.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;parkippnw&quot; &gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/mgs/7-2-parkinson.pdf | title=Maralinga: The Clean-Up of a Nuclear Test Site | publisher=International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War | accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Department of Veterans' Affairs (Australia)|Department of Veterans' Affairs]] study concluded that &quot;Overall, the doses received by Australian participants were small.&amp;nbsp;... Only 2% of participants received more than the current Australian annual dose limit for occupationally exposed persons (20 mSv).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaresults&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dva.gov.au/media/publicat/2006/nuclear_test/dosimetry/pdf/dosimetry_chapter_7_results.pdf |title=Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests in Australia 2006 â€“ Dosimetry |publisher=Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs |page=145 |accessdate=2 December 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802150714/http://www.dva.gov.au/media/publicat/2006/nuclear_test/dosimetry/pdf/dosimetry_chapter_7_results.pdf |archivedate=2 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such findings are contested. Australian servicemen were ordered to: repeatedly fly through the mushroom clouds from atomic explosions, without protection; and to march into ground zero immediately after bomb detonation.  Airborne drifts of [[radioactive material]] resulted in &quot;radioactive rain&quot; being dropped on Brisbane and Queensland country areas. A 1999 study for the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association found that 30 per cent of involved veterans had died, mostly in their fifties, from cancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article5561441.ece Do atomic test victims deserve compensation?]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612114615/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article5561441.ece |date=12 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successive Australian governments failed to compensate servicemen who contracted cancers following exposure to radiation at Maralinga.  However, after a British decision in 1988 to compensate its own servicemen, the Australian Government negotiated compensation for several Australian servicemen suffering from two specific conditions, [[leukemia]] (except [[lymphatic leukemia]]) and the rare blood disorder [[multiple myeloma]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Broinowski (2003). ''Fact or Fission: The Truth About Australia's Nuclear Ambitions'', Scribe Publications, pp. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

One author suggests that the resettlement and denial of aboriginal access to their homelands &quot;contributed significantly to the social disintegration which characterises the community to this day. [[Petrol sniffing]], juvenile crime, alcoholism and chronic friction between residents and the South Australian police have become facts of life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;grabosky&quot; /&gt; In 1994, the Australian Government reached a compensation settlement with [[Maralinga Tjarutja]], which resulted in the payment of $13.5 million in settlement of all claims in relation to the nuclear testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;radwaste&quot; /&gt;

==Media coverage==

According to Liz Tynan from [[James Cook University]], the Maralinga tests were a striking example of what can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as [[Avon Hudson]] spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist [[Brian Toohey]] ran a series of stories in the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.&lt;ref name=ltynan /&gt;

In June 1993, ''[[New Scientist]]'' journalist Ian Anderson wrote an article entitled &quot;Britain's dirty deeds at Maralinga&quot; and several related articles. They are a detailed analysis of the legacy of Vixen B and the Australian government's prolonged negotiations with the United Kingdom on cleaning up Maralinga and sharing the cost of &quot;safe-sealing&quot; waste [[plutonium]]. Previously, much of this highly toxic nuclear waste had simply been lightly bulldozed into the soil rather than buried in deep, secure, purpose-built, concrete bunkers. In 1993, Anderson won two [[Michael Daley Award]]s for his Maralinga articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Jones&quot;/&gt;

''[[Maralinga: Australiaâ€™s Nuclear Waste Cover-up]]'' is a book by [[Alan Parkinson (engineer)|Alan Parkinson]] about the clean-up following the British nuclear tests at Maralinga, published in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au&quot;/&gt; Parkinson, a nuclear engineer, explains that the clean-up of Maralinga in the late 1990s was compromised by cost-cutting and simply involved dumping hazardous radioactive debris in shallow holes in the ground.  Parkinson states that &quot;What was done at Maralinga was a cheap and nasty solution that wouldn't be adopted on white-fellas land.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuclear waste and indigenous rights&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;greenleft.org.au&quot;/&gt;

== In popular culture ==

''[[Ground Zero (1987 film)|Ground Zero]]'' is a fictional political conspiracy [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] about what happened during the Maralinga tests.

The 1991 folk song &quot;Plains of Maralinga&quot; by [[Alistair Hulett]] describes the tests and their deadly side-effects on the Pitjantjatjara people.

''The Career Highlights of the Mamu'' is an Australian play by Trevor Jamieson and Scott Rankin, performed by the [[Adelaide Festival]] in Februaryâ€“March 2002.  The play tells the story of the [[Tjuntjuntjara]] Aboriginal people, who lived in the desert country between [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]], and their experience with British nuclear testing at Maralinga and Emu Field. Tribal elders describe being moved out of the area, and the death and illness of their people when they attempted to return to their contaminated homelands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.flinders.edu.au/dspace/handle/2328/243 The Career Highlights of Mamu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Broinowski (2003). ''Fact or Fission: The Truth About Australia's Nuclear Ambitions'', Scribe Publications, pp. 175â€“176.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Maralinga: The [[Anangu]] Story'', by the [[Yalata]] &amp; [[Oak Valley, South Australia|Oak]] Communities with [[Christobel Mattingley]] ([[Allen &amp; Unwin]], 2009), is an information book about the history and culture of the region, the controversy and its original owners. Aimed at young people, the book was awarded a silver Honour medal in 2010 by the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/messagestick/stories/s2716335.htm  |title=Maralinga: The Anangu Story |date=18 October 2009  |work=Message Stick |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Stranglers]] referenced the nuclear tests in Australia in their song &quot;[[Nuclear Device (The Wizard of Aus)]]&quot;.

Australian rock band [[Midnight Oil]] recorded a song about the tests called &quot;Maralinga&quot; on their 1982 debut LP [[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]].

The tests were the subject of the song &quot;Birthright&quot; by progressive rock group [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]]. The Australian band [[Midnight Oil]] wrote a song about the tests called &quot;Maralinga&quot;.

The Australian writer Judy Nunn published a novel titled ''Maralinga'' in 2011.

The novel ''The Last Albatross'' by Ian Irvine referenced this location as the source of weapons grade plutonium used in a terror plot against Australia.

Web comic author Aaron Diaz wrote a one-page comic re-imagining the Maralinga tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dresdencodak.com/2005/06/23/operation-buffalo/ Dresden Codak Â» Archive Â» Operation Buffalo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional story of a man with leukemia who was present during the tests featured in the 1982 ''[[A Country Practice]]'' episode &quot;Field of Thunder.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.australiantelevision.net/acp/1982.html|title = Australian Television Information Archive|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary school in the Melbourne suburb of Keysborough was named Maralinga primary school between 1975-2009.
