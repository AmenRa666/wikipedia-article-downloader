The '''923d Expeditionary Air Refueling Flight''' is a provisional [[United States Air Force]] unit, assigned to [[Air Combat Command]] to activate or inactivate as needed.

The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated during [[World War II]] as the '''23d Air Corps Ferrying Squadron''' at [[Morrison Field]], Florida in 1942.  In October 1943 the squadron and its parent group were disbanded and replaced as the [[Air Transport Command]] unit at Morrison by Station 11, Caribbean Wing, Air Transport Command.

The squadron was reconstituted in 1954 as the '''23d Air Transport Squadron''', Medium, a [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] unit, at [[Charleston Air Force Base]], South Carolina. The squadron was inactivated in 1955.

The '''923d Air Refueling Squadron''' operated [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s at [[K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base]], Ohio from 1960 to 1961, when its mission, personnel and equipment were transferred to the [[46th Air Refueling Squadron]].

In September 1985, the 923d and 23d squadrons were consolidated into a single squadron.  The 923d was converted to provisional status as the '''923d Expeditionary Air Refueling Flight''' and assigned to [[Air Mobility Command]] to activate or inactivate as needed.

==History==

===Airlift operations===
The squadron was first activated during [[World War II]] as the '''23d Air Corps Ferrying Squadron''' at [[Morrison Field]], Florida in 1942.  The squadron ferried aircraft between Florida and points in western Africa.  From 1943, the unit then focused on the air transportation mission as the '''23d Transport Squadron'''.  Although the squadron was stationed at Morrison, its personnel were also used to man other stations of the Caribbean Wing.  After a little more than a year of trying to use traditional [[Table of organization and equipment|Table of Organization]] units like the 23d, [[Air Transport Command]] (ATC) found them too inflexible for its operations.  It, therefore, decided to replace its groups and squadrons and assign personnel directly to each of its stations, based on the needs of the station.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, in October 1943 the squadron and its parent group were disbanded as ATC combined its units at Morrison into Station 11, Caribbean Wing, Air Transport Command.

[[File:An USAF C-54 Skymaster.jpg|thumb|MATS C-54 Skymaster]]
The squadron was reactivated in March 1954 at [[Charleston Air Force Base]], South Carolina as the '''23d Air Transport Squadron'''&lt;ref name=Mueller89&gt;''See'' Mueller, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; with the responsibility of transporting personnel, materiel, mail and other strategic cargo for the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]] and civilian agencies.  The squadron was assigned to the [[1608th Air Transport Group]], which had been activated two months earlier.  However, shortages of personnel and equipment delayed the group from reaching operational status upon activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/494/553.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, Initial History 1608 Air Transport Group|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadron operated [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] aircraft, flying missions to Europe and North Africa until inactivating in July 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/494/170.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 23 Air Transport Squadron Jul-Dec 1954|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air refueling operations===
The '''923d Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated on 1 May 1960 by [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) at [[K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base]], Michigan, where it was assigned to the [[4042d Strategic Wing]].&lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;''See'' Mueller, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;  The 4042d wing was established by SAC in a program to disperse its [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/056/917.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract (Unclassified), Vol 1, History of Strategic Air Command, Jan–Jun 1957 (Secret)|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SAC bases with large concentrations of bombers made attractive targets.  SAC’s response was to break up its wings and scatter their aircraft over a larger number of bases.&lt;ref&gt;Knaack, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadron was initially nominally manned, but it received its first [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]] on 5 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/460/301.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 4042 Strategic Wing August 1960|date= |publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron provided [[air refueling]] support to USAF units as directed.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The squadron transferred its personnel and equipment to the 46th Air Refueling Squadron before the 4042d wing's [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] squadron was activated.&lt;/ref&gt;   The squadron became fully operationally ready by March 1961 and one third of the squadron's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute [[alert state|alert]], fully fueled and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/010/802.xml|last1=|first1=|title=Abstract (Unclassified), History of the Strategic Bomber since 1945 (Top Secret, downgraded to Secret)|date=1 April 1975|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/465/130.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 40 Air Division March 1961|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron inactivated a little less than a year after being activated when its personnel, equipment and aircraft were transferred to the [[46th Air Refueling Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/465/131.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 40 Air Division April 1961|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985 the 23d Air Transport Squadron and the 923d Air Refueling Squadron were consolidated into a single unit.&lt;ref name=DAFMPM662q&gt;Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 662q, 19 September 85, Subject: Reconstitution, Redesignation, and Consolidation of Selected Air Force Tactical Squadrons&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, the squadron was redesignated the '''923d Expeditionary Air Refueling Flight''' and assigned to [[Air Mobility Command]] as a provisional unit to activate or inactivate as needed.
