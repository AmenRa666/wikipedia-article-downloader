The '''Yugoslav submarine ''Osvetnik''''' (Avenger) was the first of the {{sclass-|Osvetnik|submarine|0}} [[diesel-electric]] [[submarine]]s built by [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]], [[Nantes]], France for the navy of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia). She was launched in 1929, and was built to a partial [[double hull]] Simonot design similar to the French {{sclass-|Circé|submarine|4}}. She was armed with six {{convert|550|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]], one {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and one {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]], and could dive to {{convert|80|m|ft}}.

Prior to [[World War II]] she participated in several cruises to [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] ports. During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, she was captured by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian forces]] at the [[Bay of Kotor]]. Initially designated ''N1'', her armament was changed and her [[conning tower]] modified. Due to her age and shallow diving depth, when she was commissioned into the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] as '''''Francesco Rismondo''''' her service was limited to training and experimentation. She was [[scuttling|scuttled]] off the island of [[Corsica]] by the Germans shortly after her capture in September 1943 following the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender]].

==Description and construction==
Yugoslav naval policy in the [[interwar period]] lacked direction until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=732}} although it was generally accepted that the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of [[submarine]]s, coastal [[torpedo boat]]s, [[torpedo bomber]]s and conventional [[bomber]] aircraft to perform this role. The [[Osvetnik-class submarine|''Osvetnik''-class]] submarines were one of the acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=779}}

''Osvetnik'' was built for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) by the [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] company (ACL) at [[Nantes]], France. Her partial [[double hull]] design,{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=171}} was based on plans by ACL's chief engineer, G. Simonot,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} and was similar to the French {{sclass-|Circé|submarine|4}}.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}} Her [[Serbo-Croatian]] name translates as &quot;Avenger&quot;. Along with her [[sister ship|sister submarine]] {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Smeli||2}}, she had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|66.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a surfaced [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|3.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Her surfaced [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|630|LT}}, or ({{convert|809|LT}} submerged, and her crew consisted of 43 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} She had an operational depth of {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}}

She had two shafts driven by two [[MAN SE|MAN]] (Maschinenfabrik) [[diesel engine]]s (when surfaced) or two Nancy electric motors (when submerged), and carried {{convert|25|t|LT}} of [[fuel oil]]. The diesel engines were rated at {{convert|1480|bhp|lk=in|abbr=on}} and the electric motors at {{convert|1000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}}, and she was designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|14.5|kn|lk=in}} under diesel power while surfaced, and {{convert|9.2|kn}} on her electric motors when submerged.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}} She was armed with six {{convert|550|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]] (four bow-mounted, two stern-mounted), one {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and one {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} She had a surfaced radius of action of {{convert|3500|nmi}} at {{convert|9|kn}}, and {{convert|75|nmi|lk=no}} at {{convert|5|kn}} submerged.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=188}}

==Service history==
''Osvetnik'' was the first of her class, and the third submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which subsequently became the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]]. She was launched on 14 January 1929.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} She and her sister submarine ''Smeli'' arrived in the [[Bay of Kotor]] on 9 December 1929.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}} In September 1933, ''Osvetnik'' and the British-designed submarine {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}} cruised the southern part of the central Mediterranean.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=453}} In August 1935, ''Osvetnik'' visited Malta, this time in company with the British-designed submarine {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}}.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=641}} In August 1936, ''Nebojša'' and ''Osvetnik'' visited the Greek island of [[Corfu]].{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=738}}

When the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] began on 6 April 1941, she was located in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast along with the three other submarines of the Submarine Division.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=267}} On 10 April, ''Osvetnik'' and ''Hrabri'' received orders for an operation against the Italian enclave of [[Province of Zara|Zara]] on the [[Dalmatia]]n coastline, but the mission did not proceed.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=374}} On 17 April, she was captured by the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] [[XVII Corps (Italy)|XVII Corps]] at the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=251}}{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=457}}

Still in good condition, she was taken as war booty, and initially designated ''N1'' by the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]]. She was refitted and modernised at [[Pula|Pola]] in the upper Adriatic, which involved the replacement of some of her armament and modifications to her [[conning tower]]. After these modifications, her displacement was {{convert|665|LT}} ({{convert|822|LT}} submerged).{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|pp=170–171}} She was commissioned by the Italians as the {{sclass-|Bajamonti|submarine|0}} ''Francesco Rismondo'', named after [[Francesco Rismondo]], a Dalmatian-born Italian hero of [[World War I]]. Despite her submerged stability and good diving rate of 35 seconds, her age and shallow diving depth meant that she was only used for training and experimentation.{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|pp=170–171}} Shortly after the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender]], she was captured by the Germans on 14 September 1943 at [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]] at the southern tip of the island of [[Corsica]], and they [[scuttling|scuttled]] her four days later.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}
