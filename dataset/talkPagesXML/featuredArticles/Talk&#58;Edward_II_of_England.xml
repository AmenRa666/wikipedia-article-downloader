== Happy to discuss... ==

Contaldo80, just to say that I'm very happy to discuss the historical work on Edward II and sexuality if that helps at all (NB: if you haven't already seen it, I'd strongly recommend the 2006 contributions to the &quot;New Perspectives&quot; volume if you've got access to it). [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 14:15, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
:Thanks. I'm glad that we can cooperate constructively. However, for the moment I'm concerned that you've misundertood my amendments. Firstly I added a good chunk of material covering what is said in various contemporary chronicles - as this is the best primary material we have then no reason why it shouldn't be used. And I was puzzled as to why you removed it. For example, the assertion that Edward's father-in-law was not concerned about Edward's sexual inclinations is wrong - he did have his suspicions. More fundamentally I do think we need to be careful about using the word &quot;homosexual&quot;. Not because I'm personally squeamish but rather because it is slightly anachronistic. The issue is rather did Edward have physical - or romantic - relations with men (as well as women as this is documented)? Would we say, for example, that Edward has heterosexual relations with Isabella? Probably not as the phrasing is odd. Perhaps we can come up with a sensible approach between us. I also removed some of the editorialising about how we see things differently in the 21st century; I don't think that's needed. And I'm not sure the medieval church did see sodomy as heretical - but agree it was often cited as one of the things that heretics did. Thanks [[User:Contaldo80|Contaldo80]] ([[User talk:Contaldo80|talk]]) 08:42, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
::It is certainly appropriate to describe a sexual relationship between two men as homosexual, whether the men lived 60 years ago or 600 years ago, but it is not necessary to do so when it is clear that we are talking about two men. I agree with Contaldo, though, that constantly describing the possible sexual relationship between Edward ''and another man'' as homosexual is as unnecessary as describing his relationship with his wife as heterosexual. Furthermore, if he and Gaveston were lovers, they could not have been anything but &quot;homosexual lovers&quot;. [[User:Surtsicna|Surtsicna]] ([[User talk:Surtsicna|talk]]) 09:30, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:::(edit conflict) Cheers. My thoughts:
:::*In terms of the use of primary sources, the guidance is from [[WP:PRIMARY]]; we shouldn't, typically, be citing primary sources on the wiki, but rather the very best of the secondary sources from specialist historians (which is the inverse of normal scholarly practice, I know...!) Interpreting medieval chronicles is really hard, which is why we turn to secondary sources.
:::*Using authors like Ian Crofton and David Loades for an article like this needs to be done with a great deal of care. Crofton writes general, popular reference books, and isn't a professional historian, let alone a medieval specialist. Loades is a notable 16th century Tudor specialist, but beyond the odd comment in popular history books on the history of England as a whole, has never written in detail on the 14th century that I'm aware of. His opinions on the Tudor period are really important... but he's not a specialist on Edward II, and his views on Philip IV don't tally up with those of the historical experts on that specific period. We should be drawing on the top historians on the early 14th century - I'll give Mark Ormrod as a classic example - for the opinions being cited. (Equally, you wouldn't normally use Ormrod as a source for an article on the Tudor court in the 1500s - I'd be turning to Loades for that, it works both ways!)
:::*Homosexual/ sexual. There are clearly a range of different views among historians on how to use the terminology here (for some &quot;homosexual&quot; carries particular 21st century cultural baggage, for others it doesn't; some would follow Foucault on this, others wouldn't etc.). Provided we're consistent within the article, as per Surtsicna's recent edits for example, I'm personally reasonably relaxed. If we can get consensus on this language, leaving a hidden note in the text for later editors would be no bad thing either.
:::*The commentary about how homosexuality/sexuality was seen is brought up by several key historians on the period when discussing Edward II, and I think therefore needs to be in there. It also helps explain why this was a charged issue. I'll double-check the original source for the wording to make sure it hasn't lost anything in translation! If other specialists disagree with the sexuality/heresy linkage, then we should reflect and cite it of course. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 09:54, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
Some constructive comments - thanks. Some of your approaches for dealing with different parts of the material seem broadly sensible. Happy also to use Ormrod as he was one of my lecturers at college :) But having had a read of where we are, I have some outstanding concerns. Firstly, while I accept that it's not appropriate for us to insert primary sources based on our own research; it is ok to use them where historians (secondary sources) have cited them to illuminate a point. So I don't know why we dropped the quotes from the Vita Edwardus Secundi and the Flores Historiarum? My preference would be to re-include them. Secondly is it really true that Mark Ormrod has said that homosexuality was &quot;equated&quot; with heresy? Perhaps many &quot;heretics&quot; were frequently accused by the Church of sodomy etc; but that's not to say the Church automatically defined someone as a heretic if they had engaged in sodomy. Some clarification needed I think.  [[User:Contaldo80|Contaldo80]] ([[User talk:Contaldo80|talk]]) 08:53, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
::I'd love to meet Ormrod - I've enjoyed his work!
::I'd argue that it remains essential on the wiki to be using primary sources in accordance with, and cited to, the best secondary source. The second half of the Secundi quote isn't used by Phillips and most of the others, but Chaplais picks it up, and, if you're content, I'd propose adding it in and reference it to him accordingly; he notes that it's meaning is &quot;disappointingly vague&quot;, though! Flores seems to be treated with caution (explicitly so by Phillips, who cautions against it as a source; I can't find it being used by the other clutch of current academics here) so I'm a bit more reticent on that. 
::The sentence that runs: &quot;Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, who equated it with heresy&quot; is cited to Prestwich, who notes that &quot;it was tantamount to heresy&quot; and talks about the &quot;church's condemnation of homosexuality&quot;. I can see that there could potentially be a subtle difference between saying that homosexuality could be ''equated'' with heresy, and the sense that it was ''tantamount'' to heresy (although tantamount can certainly mean &quot;equivalent to&quot;), so if we can find a better/more precise phrasing, happy to discuss it.

==Edward of Caernarfon?==
Was he really called Edward of Caernarfon?  I suspect he was called Edward of Carnarvon.  When I was a child, back in the 1960s, the town's name was Caernarfon if you were speaking Welsh, but Carnarvon or Caernarvon if you were speaking English (similar thing for Conway/Conway).  Since then, it's been decided that the modern name of the town is Caernarfon in both languages.  But back in Edward's day it would, for an English speaker, have been almost certainly spelt as Carnarvon.  As titles go, the current Lord Carnarvon is still Lord Carnarvon.  So I believe that he should be referred to as Edward of Carnarvon, because he was England, spoke English rather than Welsh, and we are in English Language Wikipedia rather than Welsh Language Wikipedia (Edward ap Caernarvon?) [[User:Simhedges|Simhedges]] ([[User talk:Simhedges|talk]]) 11:47, 3 October 2014 (UTC)
: Actually, Edward would have spoken Anglo-Norman French as his birth language. And most anything written would have been in Latin, rather than English or Welsh. English kings had French as their first language until Henry V ... almost a hundred years after Edward II. [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 13:51, 3 October 2014 (UTC)
:: Edward was born in Carnarvon, Carnarvonshire, not Caernarfon, Gwnedd. What we are debating is whether we should discuss a person as in a different time and distant place, or &quot;update&quot; him to somehow retain relevance to today and the same GPS coordinates. My vote is to guide the reader to understand how different the time and place were yet how Edward had the same human qualities we see today. He was born in a location under military rule very different from the Caernarfon of today, in a motte and bailey castle very different from the stone castle seen today. Tourists will still visit beautiful Caernarfon; there is no reason to skew the history. Regarding Latin and Norman French: spelling was rather fluid in that era so look to the document forming Carnarvonshire for the spelling in use at his birth.[[Special:Contributions/68.32.154.213|68.32.154.213]] ([[User talk:68.32.154.213|talk]]) 11:28, 24 April 2015 (UTC)
:::Carnavonshire was created by the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] which was in Latin. As Ealdgyth says, Edward spoke Norman-French. I'm not sure what either the medieval Latin or medieval Norman-french for Caernarfonshire was but I suspect that neither would give you &quot;Caernarfon&quot; or &quot;Carnarvon&quot;. So claiming that either is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; is spurious. The normal convention is generally to use the modern place-name. [[User:DeCausa|DeCausa]] ([[User talk:DeCausa|talk]]) 16:54, 24 April 2015 (UTC)
::::I'd agree with Eadldyth's comments from last year on the Latin point. Either way, though, we should be following the practice set by high-quality, reliable secondary sources on Edward (as the article does), rather than straying into OR. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 17:15, 24 April 2015 (UTC)
:::::At [[WP:NCGN]] and it says this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the place does not exist anymore, or the article deals only with a place in a period when it held a different name, the widely accepted ''historical'' English name should be used.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
:::::The debate regarding his appellation differs from the debate regarding the name of the castle and town of his birth. A book that rehashes older secondary sources for the purpose of sales in the castle gift shop, but lack original contributions to scholarship or research, is not a ''reliable secondary source'' for Edward's accepted historical names. Edward is usually referred to today as Edward II, and in multiple scholarly works has also been referred to as Edward of Carnarvon (for example: The Captivity and Death of Edward of Carnarvon, by Thomas Frederick Tout); in today's English language, Édouard de Carnarvon in today's French language, and Edward o Caernarfon in today's Welsh language.[[Special:Contributions/68.32.154.213|68.32.154.213]] ([[User talk:68.32.154.213|talk]]) 18:36, 24 April 2015 (UTC)
The information is cited to [[J. R. S. Phillips|Seymour Phillips]]' 2011 volume, a 679-page peer reviewed book published by Yale University Press, one of the leading academic presses in the world - I can't vouch for Yale University Press's intent in publishing it, or Phillips' in writing it, but I doubt that it was aimed at sales in the local castle gift shop in North Wales... ;) Tout died in 1929, and his work is no longer authoritative for this period.

==Please do not use LGBT label on Edward II of England ==

It is total affront to good historical, scholarly research such labels! Why so asks a layman? 1. Applying [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] concepts on historical people and events are a definitive NO NO! (ex. In the [[USSR]], according to the  [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninist Theory of History]]  [[Thomas Müntzer]] was a communist - a pure example of anachronism)  2. No source or a support of a widely held view among scholars. [[User:Major Torp|Major Torp]] ([[User talk:Major Torp|talk]]) 10:15, 7 November 2014 (UTC)
:The policy guidelines on this appears to be [[Wikipedia:Categorization/Ethnicity,_gender,_religion_and_sexuality#Sexuality]]. This states that &quot;For a dead person, there must be a verified consensus of reliable published sources that the description is appropriate. Historically, LGBT people often did not come out in the way that they commonly do today, so a person's own self-identification is, in many cases, impossible to verify by the same standards that would be applicable to a contemporary BLP. For a dead person, a broad consensus of academic and/or biographical scholarship about the topic is sufficient to describe a person as LGBT.&quot;
:Current mainstream historians almost all agree that it is impossible to know for certain today what the details of Edward's sexual relationships in the 13th-14th centuries were; all agree that he had some sexual relations with women, and many believe that he probably also had sexual relations with men. Opinions on the interpretation of these conclusions - e.g. whether Edward is best described as straight, homosexual, etc., or  whether these labels are not helpful - vary considerably. Among the artistic community, of course, Edward has been widely depicted as a homosexual (Jarman's film being perhaps the most obvious example).
:Given the Wiki guidelines, which explicitly address the use of the LGBT category label for historical figures, and the historical literature on his sexuality, I would consider the LGBT category to be appropriate in this case. If there are concerns about the guidelines and anachronism, I think it would be best to take that up on the relevant talk page, rather than article by article.

:::Wait, you're saying yourself that &quot;current mainstream historians almost all agree that it is impossible to know for certain today what the details of Edward's sexual relationships&quot; yet despite that you're still thinking that these labels should apply?  You are saying yourself that there is no consensus among historians as to what Edward's sexuality was, therefore how does it meet the guidelines to include these labels? I apologize for not commenting earlier, As I only just noticed this discussion today (and I could argue that since you're the only one who wants to add them here, there's no consensus for including it). [[User:Psunshine87|Psunshine87]] ([[User talk:Psunshine87|talk]]) 17:27, 12 November 2014 (UTC)
::::Yes, that's broadly my opinion. Current historians almost all agree that it is impossible to know for certain what happened in private between two people in the 13-14th century; many historians do believe, however, that Edward probably had sexual relations with men, sufficient in my opinion to justify the category label being present in the article. Several editors have now removed the existing categories, and several have added them back in, and I don't believe that the discussion so far here on the talk page has produced a clear consensus for change. Where no consensus on an edit exists, the usual guidelines are for the original version to remain in place, and the existing version of the text prior to the removal of the categories on 26 October included the categories (and they seem to have been present since Willthacheerleader18 added them back in June).

Torp, if you're looking for some reading on this topic, I'd suggest starting with the works cited in the article, which covers the current academic corpus on Edward fairly comprehensively. The two most recent biographies by Haines and Phillips would give you a framework, and I'd then recommend working through the relevant chapters on sexuality in Dodd and Musson's edited volume ''The Reign of Edward II''.

== Ambiguous/Misleading: Wine and Pimento ==
Sorry, I'm not wiki-savvy enough to have the confidence to edit it, but found this surprising &quot;a fountain that produced wine and pimento, a spiced medieval drink&quot; (because it's pre-Columbus). It turns out that pimento in this context is a drink on its own, and has no relationship to the sweet chilli. Re-wording it to &quot;a fountain that produced pimento, a spiced medieval drink, and wine...&quot; would remove the ambiguity and resulting confusion. &lt;ref&gt;Alexander Samson, &quot;Locus Amoenus: Gardens and Horticulture in the Renaissance&quot;, Wiley 2012, P53&lt;/ref&gt;, but there are probably more suitable references.

==Categories==
I have removed the &quot;LGBT&quot; categories because the article is well-referenced to the effect that Edward's homosexuality is a matter of dispute. 
This is certainly a notable discussion, but, as the article is aware: 
:&quot;Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour&quot;
You do not get to &quot;out&quot; people as &quot;LGBT&quot; merely because some commentator has speculated they might have had a homosexual relationship. There needs to be positive self-identification, or overwhelming consensus of historians. Even ''if'' there was such a consensus, the appropriate category would be [[:Category:Homosexual people]], and ''not'' &quot;LGBT people&quot;, as we don't have a single reference associating Edward with the (post-1990) &quot;LGBT&quot; moniker.

I am documenting this perfectly straightforward category edit here beause it has been reverted by [[User:Contaldo80]], not based on any argument related to the subject matter but with a threatening edit summary, 
:&quot;This is all rather disruptive. Try talk page before trying to push some sort of POV agenda on hundreds of article pages. Administrators please take note.&quot;
I am editing here as a contributor, not an admin, but for context please note that I have been an administrator since 2004 and I am perfectly familiar with Wikipedia policy, and I know the difference between a content dispute and &quot;disruptive editing&quot;. 

I am not &quot;pushing an agenda&quot; (not categorising somebody is ''not'' making a judgement as to their sexuality. I have no opinion on the sexual orientation of Edward II, and I am not categorizing Edward II as a &quot;straight medieval person&quot; -- which category for some strange reason we do not even seem to have. It's almost as if sexual orientation is not an encyclopedic question unless it is directly tied to the notablility of a person). 
I am happy to assume that the miscategorisation was an honest mistake based on incomplete information, but the behavior of Contaldo80 does seem to at least suggest the presence of a &quot;POV agenda&quot; being present at least in this particular contributor.  --[[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|(𒁳)]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:58, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
:What POV agenda are you accusing me of? State clearly here and present the evidence or retract and apologise. &quot;There needs to be positive self-identification, or overwhelming consensus of historians&quot; - this is again your opinion and not what the guidance states with regards to this category. The use of &quot;straight&quot; is also offensive - as the opposite then becomes &quot;bent&quot;. Or are you suggesting that it would be better to refer to &quot;Bent royalty&quot;?

::I agree with Dbachman. The categories bisexual men and bisexual royalty assume that the subject of the article is bisexual. His sexuality is uncertain, so the categories are not appropriate.  [[User:Dudley Miles|Dudley Miles]] ([[User talk:Dudley Miles|talk]]) 16:37, 16 November 2016 (UTC)

I'm less sure. Our policy on this doesn't require us to be &quot;certain&quot;; if memory serves, it requires that reliable sources &quot;commonly and consistently&quot; use this as a defining characteristic of the subject. It is certainly commonly discussed in relation to Edward; I think the &quot;consistent&quot; bit is more questionable, as there are obviously exceptions, but even those critiquing the homosexuality theory still expend considerable space in their works discussing the issue. We also talk in the policy about a &quot;consensus&quot; in reliable sources for historical figures; a consensus doesn't have to be unanimous or overwhelming. On balance I'd be inclined to go with Contaldo on this one at this stage. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 18:37, 16 November 2016 (UTC)</text>
