'''Trinity''' was the [[code name]] of the first detonation of a [[nuclear weapon]], conducted by the [[United States Army]] at 5:29 am on July 16, 1945, as part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. The test was conducted in the [[Jornada del Muerto]] desert about {{convert|35|mi}} southeast of [[Socorro, New Mexico]], on what was then the USAAF Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range (now part of [[White Sands Missile Range]]). The only structures originally in the vicinity were the [[McDonald Ranch House]] and its ancillary buildings, which scientists used as a laboratory for testing bomb components. A base camp was constructed, and there were 425 people present on the weekend of the test.

The [[#Code name|code name]] &quot;Trinity&quot; was assigned by [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], the director of the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], inspired by the poetry of [[John Donne]]. The test was of an [[Nuclear weapon design|implosion-design]] [[plutonium]] device, informally nicknamed &quot;The Gadget&quot;, of the same design as the [[Fat Man]] bomb later [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|detonated over Nagasaki]], Japan, on August 9, 1945. The complexity of the design required a major effort from the Los Alamos Laboratory, and concerns about whether it would work led to a decision to conduct the first [[nuclear test]]. The test was planned and directed by [[Kenneth Bainbridge]].

Fears of a [[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]] led to the construction of a steel containment vessel called Jumbo that could contain the plutonium, allowing it to be recovered, but Jumbo was not used. A rehearsal was held on May 7, 1945, in which {{convert|108|ST|LT t}} of high explosive spiked with radioactive isotopes were detonated. The Gadget's detonation released the explosive energy of about {{convert|22|ktonTNT|lk=on}}. Observers included [[Vannevar Bush]], [[James Chadwick]], [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]], [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Leslie Groves]], Robert Oppenheimer, [[G. I. Taylor|Geoffrey Taylor]], and [[Richard Tolman]].

The test site was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] district in 1965, and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] the following year.

== Background ==
{{Main article|Manhattan Project}}
The creation of [[nuclear weapon]]s arose from scientific and political developments of the 1930s. The decade saw many new discoveries about the nature of atoms, including the existence of [[nuclear fission]]. The concurrent rise of [[fascist]] governments in Europe led to a fear of a [[German nuclear weapon project]], especially among scientists who were refugees from [[Nazi Germany]] and other fascist countries. When their calculations showed that nuclear weapons were theoretically feasible, the British and United States governments supported an all-out effort to build them.{{sfn|Szasz|1992|pp = 3–8}}

These efforts were transferred to the authority of the [[U.S. Army]] in June 1942, and became the [[Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp = 30–31}} [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], was appointed its director in September 1942.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 76}} The weapons development portion of this project was located at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in northern [[New Mexico]], under the directorship of physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. The [[University of Chicago]], [[Columbia University]] and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] conducted other development work.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 63}}

Production of the [[fissile]] [[isotopes]] [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium-239]] were enormous undertakings given the technology of the 1940s, and accounted for 80% of the total costs of the project. [[Uranium enrichment]] was carried out at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] near [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bookings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/projects/archive/nucweapons/manhattan.aspx |title=The Costs of the Manhattan Project |publisher= Brookings Institution |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques, but it proved difficult to scale to industrial levels and was extremely costly. Only 0.71 percent of natural uranium was [[uranium-235]], and it was estimated that it would take 27,000 years to produce a gram of uranium with [[mass spectrometer]]s, but kilogram amounts were required.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 10}}

Plutonium is a [[synthetic element]] with complicated physical, chemical and metallurgical properties. It is not found in nature in appreciable quantities. Until mid-1944, the only plutonium that had been isolated had been produced in [[cyclotron]]s in microgram amounts, whereas weapons required kilograms.{{sfn|Baker|Hecker|Harbur|1983|pp = 142–151}} In April 1944, physicist [[Emilio Segrè]], the head of the Los Alamos Laboratory's P-5 (Radioactivity) Group,{{sfn|Hawkins|Truslow|Smith||1961|p=101}} received the first sample of reactor-bred plutonium from the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at Oak Ridge. He discovered that, in addition to the [[plutonium-239]] isotope, it also contained significant amounts of [[plutonium-240]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 235–239}} The Manhattan Project produced plutonium in [[nuclear reactor]]s at the [[Hanford Engineer Works]] near [[Hanford, Washington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bookings&quot; /&gt;

The longer the plutonium remained irradiated inside a reactor—necessary for high yields of the metal—the greater the content of the plutonium-240 isotope, which undergoes [[spontaneous fission]] at thousands of times the rate of plutonium-239. The extra [[neutron]]s it released meant that there was an unacceptably high probability that plutonium in a  [[gun-type fission weapon]] would detonate too soon after a [[critical mass]] was formed, producing a &quot;[[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]]&quot;—a [[nuclear explosion]] many times smaller than a full explosion.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 235–239}} This meant that the [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]] bomb design that the laboratory had developed would not work properly.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 240–242}}

The Laboratory turned to an alternative, albeit more technically difficult, design, an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]. In September 1943, mathematician [[John von Neumann]] had proposed a design in which a fissile [[pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] would be surrounded by two different [[high explosives]] that produced [[shock wave]]s of different speeds. Alternating the faster- and slower-burning explosives in a carefully calculated configuration would produce a compressive wave upon their simultaneous detonation. This so-called &quot;[[explosive lens]]&quot; focused the shock waves inward with enough force to rapidly compress the plutonium core to several times its original density. This reduced the size of a critical mass, making it supercritical. It also activated a small [[neutron source]] at the center of the core, which assured that the chain reaction began in earnest at the right moment. Such a complicated process required research and experimentation in [[engineering]] and [[hydrodynamics]] before a practical design could be developed.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 130–138}} The entire Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized in August 1944 to focus on design of a workable implosion bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 245–247}}

== Preparation ==

=== Decision ===
[[File:Trinity Test Site.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Trinity Site]]

The idea of testing the implosion device was brought up in discussions at Los Alamos in January 1944, and attracted enough support for Oppenheimer to approach Groves. Groves gave approval, but he had concerns. The Manhattan Project had spent a great deal of money and effort to produce the plutonium and he wanted to know if there would be a way to recover it. The Laboratory's Governing Board then directed [[Norman Ramsey]] to investigate how this could be done. Ramsey reported back in February 1944, proposing a small-scale test in which the explosion was limited in size by reducing the number of generations of chain reactions, and that it take place inside a sealed containment vessel from which the plutonium could be recovered.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 174–175}}

The means of generating such a controlled reaction were uncertain, and the data obtained would not be as useful as that from a full-scale explosion.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 174–175}} Oppenheimer argued that the &quot;implosion gadget must be tested in a range where the energy release is comparable with that contemplated for final use.&quot;{{sfn|Norris|2002|p = 395}} In March 1944, he obtained Groves's tentative approval for testing a full-scale explosion inside a containment vessel, although Groves was still worried about how he would explain the loss of a billion dollars worth of plutonium to a Senate Committee in the event of a failure.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 174–175}}

=== Code name ===
The exact origin of the code name &quot;Trinity&quot; for the test is unknown, but it is often attributed to Oppenheimer as a reference to the poetry of [[John Donne]], which in turn references the Christian notion of the [[Trinity]] (three-fold nature of God). In 1962, Groves wrote to Oppenheimer about the origin of the name, asking if he had chosen it because it was a name common to rivers and peaks in the West and would not attract attention, and elicited this reply:
{{quote|I did suggest it, but not on that ground&amp;nbsp;... Why I chose the name is not clear, but I know what thoughts were in my mind. There is a poem of John Donne, written just before his death, which I know and love. From it a quotation:
:''As West and East''
:''In all flatt Maps—and I am one—are one,''
:''So death doth touch the Resurrection.''{{efn|From the poem &quot;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173370 Hymn to God, My God, in My Sickness]&quot;}}{{sfn|Donne|1896|pp=211–212}}
That still does not make a Trinity, but in another, better known devotional poem Donne opens,
:''Batter my heart, three person'd God''.{{efn|''[[Holy Sonnets]]'', [[s:Holy Sonnets/Holy Sonnet 14|Holy Sonnet 14]]}}{{sfn|Donne|1896|p=165}}{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=571–572}}}}

=== Organization ===
In March 1944, planning for the test was assigned to [[Kenneth Bainbridge]], a professor of physics at [[Harvard University]], working under explosives expert [[George Kistiakowsky]]. Bainbridge's group was known as the E-9 (Explosives Development) Group.{{sfn|Hawkins|Truslow|Smith|1961|p = 266}} Stanley Kershaw, formerly from the National Safety Council, was made responsible for safety.{{sfn|Hawkins|Truslow|Smith|1961|p = 266}} [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Samuel P. Davalos, the assistant post engineer at Los Alamos, was placed in charge of construction.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 478}} [[First Lieutenant]] Harold C. Bush became commander of the Base Camp at Trinity.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 4}} Scientists [[William Penney]], [[Victor Weisskopf]] and [[Philip Burton Moon|Philip Moon]] were  consultants. Eventually seven subgroups were formed:{{sfn|Hawkins|Truslow|Smith|1961|pp = 269–270}}
*TR-1 (Services) under [[John Harry Williams|John H. Williams]]
*TR-2 (Shock and Blast) under [[John Henry Manley|John H. Manley]]
*TR-3 (Measurements) under [[Robert R. Wilson]]
*TR-4 (Meteorology) under J. M. Hubbard
*TR-5 (Spectrographic and Photographic) under Julian E. Mack
*TR-6 (Airborne Measurements) under [[Bernard Waldman]]
*TR-7 (Medical) under Louis H. Hempelmann

The E-9 group was renamed the X-2 (Development, Engineering and Tests) Group in the August 1944 reorganization.{{sfn|Hawkins|Truslow|Smith|1961|p = 266}}

=== Test site ===
[[File:TrinitySiteISS008-E-5604.jpg|thumb|right|Trinity Site (red arrow) near [[Carrizozo Malpais]]]]
Safety and security required a remote, isolated and unpopulated area. The scientists also wanted a flat area to minimize secondary effects of the blast, and with little wind to spread radioactive fallout. Eight candidate sites were considered: the [[Tularosa Basin|Tularosa Valley]]; the [[Jornada del Muerto Valley]]; the area southwest of [[Cuba, New Mexico]], and north of [[Thoreau, New Mexico|Thoreau]]; and the lava flats of the [[El Malpais National Monument]], all in New Mexico; the [[San Luis Valley]] near the [[Great Sand Dunes National Monument]] in Colorado; the [[Desert Training Center|Desert Training Area]] and [[San Nicolas Island]] in Southern California; and the sand bars of [[Padre Island]], Texas.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 3}}

The sites were surveyed by car and by air by Bainbridge, R. W. Henderson, [[Major]] W. A. Stevens and Major [[Peer de Silva]]. The site finally chosen, after consulting with [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Uzal Ent]], the commander of the [[Second Air Force]] on September 7, 1944,{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 3}} lay at the northern end of the [[Alamogordo Bombing Range]], in [[Socorro County, New Mexico|Socorro County]] near the towns of [[Carrizozo, New Mexico|Carrizozo]] and [[San Antonio, New Mexico|San Antonio]].({{Coord|33.6773|N|106.4754|W|region:US-NM_type:landmark_scale:60000|display=inline}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;wsmr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Trinity Site |publisher=White Sands Missile Range |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/TrinitySite/trinst.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601033016/http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/TrinitySite/trinst.htm |archivedate=June 1, 2008 |accessdate=July 16, 2007 |quote=GPS Coordinates for obelisk (exact GZ) = N33.40.636 W106.28.525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only structures in the vicinity were the [[McDonald Ranch House]] and its ancillary buildings, about {{convert|2|mi}} to the southeast.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 311}} Like the rest of the Alamogordo Bombing Range, it had been acquired by the government in 1942. The [[patented land]] had been [[eminent domain|condemned]] and [[grazing rights]] suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PAO/Trinity/Pages/TrinitySiteHistoryAcopyofthebrochuregiventositevisitors.aspx |title=Trinity Site History: A copy of the brochure given to site visitors |publisher=[[White Sands Missile Range]], [[United States Army]] |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McDonald&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmfarmandranchmuseum.org/oralhistory/detail.php?interview=207 |publisher=New Mexico Farm &amp; Ranch Heritage Museum |title=McDonald, David G |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists used this as a laboratory for testing bomb components.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 311}} Bainbridge and Davalos drew up plans for a base camp with accommodation and facilities for 160 personnel, along with the technical infrastructure to support the test. A construction firm from [[Lubbock, Texas]] built the barracks, officers' quarters, mess hall and other basic facilities.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 478}} The requirements expanded and, by July 1945, 250 people worked at the Trinity test site. On the weekend of the test, there were 425 present.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 40}}

[[File:Trinity basecamp.jpg|thumb|left|The Trinity test base camp]]
Lieutenant Bush's twelve-man [[military police]] unit arrived at the site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site proved too great for the horses, so they resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. The horses were used for playing [[polo]].{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 3}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Building a test site&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/trinity/building.shtml |title=Building a test site |publisher=atomicarchive.com |accessdate=August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects was a challenge. Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation, and to provide organized games and nightly movies.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 481}}

Throughout 1945, other personnel arrived at the Trinity Site to help prepare for the bomb test. They tried to use water out of the ranch wells, but found the water so [[alkaline]] they could not drink it. They were forced to use [[U.S. Navy]] [[saltwater soap]] and hauled drinking water in from the firehouse in Socorro. Gasoline and diesel were purchased from the [[Standard Oil]] plant there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Building a test site&quot; /&gt; Military and civilian construction personnel built warehouses, workshops, a magazine and commissary. The [[Siding (rail)|railroad siding]] at [[Pope, New Mexico]], was upgraded by adding an unloading platform. Roads were built, and {{convert|200|mi}} of telephone wire was strung. Electricity was supplied by portable generators.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 480}}{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 41}}

Due to its proximity to the bombing range, the base camp was accidentally bombed twice in May. When the lead plane on a practice night raid accidentally knocked out the generator or otherwise doused the lights illuminating their target, they went in search of the lights, and since they had not been informed of the presence of the Trinity base camp, and it was lit, bombed it instead.  The accidental bombing damaged  the stables and the carpentry shop, and a small fire resulted.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 42}}

=== Jumbo ===
[[File:Trinity - Jumbo brought to site.jpg|thumb|right|Jumbo arrives at the site]]
Responsibility for the design of a containment vessel for an unsuccessful explosion, known as &quot;Jumbo&quot;, was assigned to Robert W. Henderson and Roy W. Carlson of the Los Alamos Laboratory's X-2A Section. The bomb would be placed into the heart of Jumbo, and if the bomb's detonation was unsuccessful, the outer walls of Jumbo would not be breached, making it possible to recover the bomb's plutonium. [[Hans Bethe]], Victor Weisskopf, and [[Joseph O. Hirschfelder]], made the initial calculations, followed by a more detailed analysis by Henderson and Carlson.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 4}} They drew up specifications for a steel sphere {{convert|13|to|15|feet|2}} in diameter, weighing {{convert|150|ST|LT t}} and capable of handling a pressure of {{convert|50000|psi}}. After consulting with the steel companies and the railroads, Carlson produced a scaled-back cylindrical design that would be much easier to manufacture, but still difficult to transport. Carlson identified a company that normally made boilers for the Navy, [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]], had made something similar and were willing to attempt its manufacture.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 366–367}}

As delivered in May 1945,{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 43}} Jumbo was {{convert|10|feet|2}} in diameter and {{convert|25|feet|2}} long with walls {{convert|14|in|0}} thick, and weighed {{convert|214|ST|LT t}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jumbo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/trinity/jumbo.shtml |title=Jumbo |publisher=atomicarchive.com |accessdate=August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moving Jumbo&quot; /&gt; A special train brought it from [[Barberton, Ohio]], to the siding at Pope, where it was loaded on a large trailer and towed {{convert|25|miles}} across the desert by [[crawler tractor]]s.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 512}} At the time, it was the heaviest item ever shipped by rail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moving Jumbo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Moving &quot;Jumbo&quot; at the Trinity Test Site | publisher=Brookings Institution Press | url=http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/archive/nucweapons/jumbo | accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many of the Los Alamos scientists, Jumbo was &quot;the physical manifestation of the lowest point in the Laboratory's hopes for the success of an implosion bomb.&quot;{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 43}} By the time it arrived, the reactors at Hanford produced plutonium in quantity, and Oppenheimer was confident that there would be enough for a second test.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 366–367}} The use of Jumbo would interfere with the gathering of data on the explosion, the primary objective of the test.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 512}} An explosion of more than {{convert|500|tonTNT}} would vaporize the steel and make it hard to measure the thermal effects. Even {{convert|100|tonTNT}} would send fragments flying, presenting a hazard to personnel and measuring equipment.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 5}} It was therefore decided not to use it.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 512}} Instead, it was hoisted up a steel tower {{convert|800|yards|0}} from the explosion, where it could be used for a subsequent test.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 366–367}} In the end, Jumbo survived the explosion, although its tower did not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jumbo&quot; /&gt;

The development team also considered other methods of recovering active material in the event of a dud explosion. One idea was to cover it with a cone of sand. Another was to suspend the bomb in a tank of water. As with Jumbo, it was decided not to proceed with these means of containment either. The CM-10 (Chemistry and Metallurgy) group at Los Alamos also studied how the active material could be chemically recovered after a contained or failed explosion.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 5}}

=== 100-ton test ===
Because there would be only one chance to carry out the test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a rehearsal be carried out to allow the plans and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated. Oppenheimer was initially skeptical, but gave permission, and later agreed that it contributed to the success of the Trinity test.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 41}}

[[File:Trinity Test - 100 Ton Test - High Explosive Stack 002.jpg|thumb|left|Men stack crates of high explosives for the 100-ton test]]
A {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} high wooden platform was constructed {{convert|800|yd|0}} to the south-east of Trinity [[ground zero]] ({{coord|33.67123|-106.47229|display=inline}}) and {{convert|108|LT}} of [[TNT]] were stacked on top of it. Kistiakowsky assured Bainbridge that the explosives used were not susceptible to shock. This was proven correct when some boxes fell off the elevator lifting them up to the platform. Flexible tubing was threaded through the pile of boxes of explosives. A radioactive slug from Hanford with {{convert|1000|Ci|TBq|lk=on}} of [[beta ray]] activity and {{convert|400|Ci|TBq}} of [[gamma ray]] activity was dissolved, and Hempelmann poured it into the tubing.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 41}}{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 360–362}}{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 11}}

The test was scheduled for May 5, but was postponed for two days to allow for more equipment to be installed. Requests for further postponements had to be refused because they would have impacted the schedule for the main test. The detonation time was set for 04:00 [[Mountain Daylight Time]], also known as [[History of time in the United States#War Time 1918 and 1942|Mountain War time]], on May 7, but there was a 37-minute delay to allow the observation plane,{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 9}} a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] from the [[216th Army Air Forces Base Unit]] flown by Major Clyde &quot;Stan&quot; Shields,{{sfn|Dvorak|2013|pp = 9–10}} to get into position.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 9}}

The fireball of the conventional explosion was visible from [[Alamogordo Army Air Field]] {{convert|60|mi}} away, but there was little shock at the base camp {{convert|10|miles}} away.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 9}} Shields thought that the explosion looked &quot;beautiful&quot;, but it was hardly felt at {{convert|15000|feet|0}}.{{sfn|Dvorak|2013|pp = 9–10}} [[Herbert L. Anderson]] practiced using a converted [[M4 Sherman]] tank lined with lead to approach the {{convert|5|ft|2|adj=on}} deep and {{convert|30|ft|2|adj=on}} wide blast crater and take a sample of dirt, although the radioactivity was low enough to allow several hours of unprotected exposure. An electrical signal of unknown origin caused the explosion to go off 0.25 seconds early, ruining experiments that required split-second timing. The [[piezoelectric]] gauges developed by Anderson's team correctly indicated an explosion of {{convert|108|tonTNT}}, but [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and Waldman's airborne condenser gauges were far less accurate.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 360–362}}{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 12}}

In addition to uncovering scientific and technological issues, the rehearsal test revealed practical concerns as well. Over 100 vehicles were used for the rehearsal test but it was realized more would be required for the main test, and they would need better roads and repair facilities. More radios were required, and more telephone lines, as the telephone system had become overloaded. Lines needed to be buried to prevent damage by vehicles. A [[teletype]] was installed to allow better communication with Los Alamos. A town hall was built to allow for large conferences and briefings, and the mess hall had to be upgraded. Because dust thrown up by vehicles interfered with some of the instrumentation, some {{convert|20|miles}} of road was sealed at a cost of {{convert|5000|$/mi|$/km}}.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 12}}{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 41}}

=== The Gadget ===
{{See also|Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon}}
[[File:HD.4G.053 (10540204545).jpg|thumb|right|[[Norris Bradbury]], group leader for bomb assembly, stands next to the assembled Gadget atop the test tower. Later, he became the director of Los Alamos, after the departure of Oppenheimer.]]
The term &quot;[[Gadget]]&quot; was a laboratory [[euphemism]] for a bomb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/robert-f-christy |title=Robert F. Christy |publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation |accessdate=November 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from which the laboratory's weapon physics division, &quot;G Division&quot;, took its name in August 1944.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 307–308}} At that time it did not refer specifically to the Trinity Test device as it had yet to be developed,{{sfn|Hawkins|Truslow|Smith|1961|p = 228}} but once it was, it became the laboratory code name.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 307–308}} The Trinity Gadget was officially a Y-1561 device, as was the [[Fat Man]] used a few weeks later in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Nagasaki]]. The two were very similar, with only minor differences, the most obvious being the absence of fuzing and the external ballistic casing. The bombs were still under development, and small changes continued to be made to the Fat Man design.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp = 47–53}}

To keep the design as simple as possible, a near solid spherical core was chosen rather than a hollow one, although calculations showed that a hollow core would be more efficient in its use of plutonium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webofstories.com/play/robert.christy/8 |last=Christy |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christy |title=Constructing the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb |publisher=Web of Stories |accessdate=October 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 293}} The core was compressed to [[Prompt critical|prompt super-criticality]] by the implosion generated by the high explosive lens. This design became known as a &quot;Christy Core&quot;{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 270–271, 293–294}} or &quot;Christy pit&quot; after physicist [[Robert F.

Of the several [[allotropes of plutonium]], the metallurgists preferred the malleable  δ phase. This was stabilized at room temperature by alloying it with [[gallium]]. Two equal hemispheres of plutonium-gallium alloy were plated with [[silver]],{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp = 47–53}} and designated by serial numbers HS-1 and HS-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Restricted Data: The Nuclear Secrecy Blog |last=Wellerstein |first=Alex| title=The third core's revenge| url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/08/16/the-third-cores-revenge/| accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|6.19|kg|adj=on}} radioactive core generated 15 W of heat, which warmed it up to about {{convert|100|to|110|F|C}},{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp = 47–53}} and the silver plating developed blisters that had to be filed down and covered with [[gold]] foil; later cores were plated with [[nickel]] instead. The Trinity core consisted of just these two hemispheres. Later cores also included a ring with a triangular cross-section to prevent jets forming in the gap between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Restricted Data: The Nuclear Secrecy Blog | last=Wellerstein| first=Alex| title=You don't know ''Fat Man''| url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2011/11/28/you-dont-know-fat-man/| accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fat Man design model.png|thumb|300 px|left|Basic nuclear components of the Gadget. The uranium slug containing the plutonium sphere was inserted late in the assembly process.]]
A trial assembly of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses was carried out by the bomb assembly team headed by [[Norris Bradbury]] at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 365}} The remainder were handed over to [[Edward Creutz]], who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p = 657}} This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp = 661–663}}

Assembly of the nuclear capsule began on July 13 at the McDonald Ranch House, where the master bedroom had been turned into a [[clean room]]. The polonium-beryllium [[Urchin (detonator)|&quot;Urchin&quot; initiator]] was assembled, and [[Louis Slotin]] placed it inside the two hemispheres of the plutonium core. [[Cyril Stanley Smith|Cyril Smith]] then placed the core in the uranium tamper plug, or &quot;slug.&quot; Air gaps were filled with {{convert|0.5|mil|adj=on}} gold foil, and the two halves of the plug were held together with uranium washers and screws which fit smoothly into the domed ends of the plug. The completed capsule was then driven to the base of the tower.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp = 56–57}}

[[File:Slotin-Lehr-Gadget-Tamper-Plug.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louis Slotin]] and Herbert Lehr with the Gadget prior to insertion of the tamper plug (visible in front of Lehr's left knee)]]
At the tower a temporary eyebolt was screwed into the {{convert|105|lb|adj=on}} capsule, and a chain hoist was used to lower the capsule into the gadget. As the capsule entered the hole in the uranium tamper, it stuck. [[Robert Bacher]] realized that the heat from the plutonium core had caused the capsule to expand, while the explosives assembly with the tamper had cooled during the night in the desert. By leaving the capsule in contact with the tamper, the temperatures equalized and in a few minutes the capsule had slipped completely into the tamper.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp = 49–50}} The eyebolt was then removed from the capsule and replaced with a threaded uranium plug, a boron disk was placed on top of the capsule, an aluminum plug was screwed into the hole in the pusher, and the two remaining high explosive lenses were installed. Finally, the upper [[Duralumin|Dural]] polar cap was bolted into place. Assembly was completed at about 16:45 on July 13.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p = 58}}

The Gadget was hoisted to the top of a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} steel tower. The height would give a better indication of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber, as detonation in the air would maximize the amount of energy applied directly to the target (as the explosion expanded in a spherical shape) and would generate less [[nuclear fallout]]. The tower stood on four legs that went {{convert|20|ft}} into the ground, with concrete footings. Atop it was an oak platform, and a shack made of [[corrugated iron]] that was open on the western side. The Gadget was hauled up with an electric winch.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p = 654}} A truckload of mattresses was placed underneath in case the cable broke and the Gadget fell.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 368–370}} The seven man arming party, consisting of Bainbridge, Kistiakowsky, Joseph McKibben and four soldiers including Lieutenant Bush, drove out to the tower to perform the final arming shortly after 22:00 on July 15.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 368–370}}

=== Personnel ===
[[File:Trinity tower.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The {{convert|30|m|adj=on|-2}} &quot;shot tower&quot; constructed for the test]]
In the final two weeks before the test, some 250 personnel from Los Alamos were at work at the Trinity site,{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 15}} and Lieutenant Bush's command had ballooned to 125 men guarding and maintaining the base camp. Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 25}} They had enough vehicles to move 450 people to safety, and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation.{{sfn|Hacker|1987|p = 90}} Groves had warned the [[Governor of New Mexico]], [[John J. Dempsey]], that martial law might have to be declared in the southwestern part of the state.{{sfn|Norris|2002|p = 402}}

Shelters were established {{convert|10000|yd}} due north, west and south of the tower, known as N-10,000, W-10,000 and S-10,000. Each had its own shelter chief: Robert Wilson at N-10,000, John Manley at W-10,000 and [[Frank Oppenheimer]] at S-10,000.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|pp = 29–30}} Many other observers were around {{convert|20|mi}} away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations. [[Richard Feynman]] claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the goggles provided, relying on a truck windshield to screen out harmful [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths.{{sfn|Feynman|1985|p = 134}}

Bainbridge asked Groves to keep his VIP list down to just ten. He chose himself, Oppenheimer, [[Richard Tolman]], [[Vannevar Bush]], [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], Brigadier General [[Thomas F. Farrell]], [[Charles Lauritsen]], [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]], Sir [[G. I. Taylor|Geoffrey Taylor]] and Sir [[James Chadwick]].{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 25}} The VIPs viewed the test from Compania Hill, about {{convert|20|mi}} northwest of the tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABQ&quot; /&gt; The observers set up a [[betting pool]] on the results of the test. Edward Teller was the most optimistic, predicting {{convert|45|ktonTNT}}.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p = 656}} He wore gloves to protect his hands, and sunglasses underneath the [[welding goggles]] that the government had supplied everyone with.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABQ&quot; /&gt; Teller was also one of the few scientists to actually watch the test (with eye protection), instead of following orders to lie on the ground with his back turned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Edward Teller, RIP|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/edward-teller-rip |journal=The New Atlantis  |issue=3 |pp=105–107 |date=Fall 2003 |accessdate=January 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also brought suntan lotion, which he shared with the others.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p = 668}}

[[File:Trinity device readied.jpg|thumb|left|The Gadget is unloaded at the base of the tower for the final assembly]]
Others were less optimistic. Ramsey chose zero (a complete [[dud]]),  Robert Oppenheimer  chose {{convert|300|tonTNT}}, Kistiakowsky {{convert|1400|tonTNT}}, and Bethe chose  {{convert|8000|tonTNT}}.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p = 656}} Rabi, the last to arrive, took {{convert|18000|tonTNT}} by default, which would win him the pool.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p = 677}} In a video interview, Bethe stated that his choice of 8 kt was exactly the value calculated by Segrè, and he was swayed by Segrè's authority over that of a more junior [but unnamed] member of Segrè's group who had calculated 20 kt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webofstories.com/play/hans.bethe/95 |title=The atomic bomb test for 'Fat Man' - Hans Bethe |publisher==Web of stories |access-date=19 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enrico Fermi]] offered to take wagers among the top physicists and military present on whether the atmosphere would ignite, and if so whether it would destroy just the state, or incinerate the entire planet.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p = 664}} This last result had been previously calculated by Bethe to be almost impossible,{{sfn|Hamming|1998|pp = 640–650}}&lt;ref name=&quot;LA602&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00329010.pdf |title=Report LA-602, Ignition of the Atmosphere With Nuclear Bombs |publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] |format=PDF |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although for a while it had caused some of the scientists some anxiety. Bainbridge was furious with Fermi for scaring the guards who, unlike the physicists, did not have the advantage of their knowledge about the scientific possibilities. His own biggest fear was that nothing would happen, in which case he would have to head back to the tower to investigate.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 44}}

Julian Mack and [[Berlyn Brixner]] were responsible for photography. The photography group employed some fifty different cameras, taking motion and still photographs. Special [[Fastax]] cameras taking 10,000 frames per second would record the minute details of the explosion. [[Spectrograph]] cameras would record the wavelengths of light emitted by the explosion, and [[pinhole camera]]s would record gamma rays. A rotating drum spectrograph at the {{convert|10000|yd|adj=on}} station would obtain the spectrum over the first hundredth of a second. Another, slow recording one would track the fireball. Cameras were placed in bunkers only {{convert|800|yd}} from the tower, protected by steel and lead glass, and mounted on sleds so they could be towed out by the lead-lined tank.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 354–355}} Some observers brought their own cameras despite the security. Segré brought in [[Jack Aeby]]'s 35&amp;nbsp;mm Perfex 44. It would take the only known well-exposed color photograph of the detonation explosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABQ&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abqjournal.com/trinity/trinity1.htm |newspaper=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |date=July 1995 |title=The Nuclear Age's Blinding Dawn |first=Larry |last=Calloway }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explosion ==

=== Detonation ===
The scientists wanted good visibility, low humidity, light winds at low altitude and westerly winds at high altitude for the test. The best weather was predicted between July 18 and 21, but the [[Potsdam Conference]] was due to start on July 16 and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] wanted the test to be conducted before the conference began. It was therefore scheduled for July 16, the earliest date at which the bomb components would be available.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 364}}

The detonation was initially planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because of rain and lightning from early that morning. It was feared that the danger from [[radiation]] and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation.&lt;ref name=&quot;trialrun&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Countdown| work = Los Alamos: Beginning of an Era, 1943–1945| publisher = Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory | url = http://atomicarchive.com/Docs/pdfs/00285808.pdf | format = PDF | doi = | accessdate =August 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 365}} and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by [[Samuel King Allison|Samuel Allison]].{{sfn|Norris|2002|p = 404}} By 05:30 the rain had gone.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 365}} There were some communication problems. The shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the [[Voice of America]], and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in [[San Antonio, Texas]].{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 44}}

Two circling B-29s observed the test, with Shields again flying the lead plane. They carried members of [[Project Alberta]], who would carry out airborne measurements during the atomic missions. These included [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Deak Parsons]], the Associate Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the head of Project Alberta; [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], [[Harold Agnew]], [[Bernard Waldman]], [[Wolfgang Panofsky]] and [[William Penney]]. The overcast obscured their view of the test site.{{sfn|Dvorak|2013|pp = 11–13}}

At 05:29:21 MWT (± 2 seconds),{{sfn|Gutenberg|1946|pp = 327–330}} the device exploded with an energy equivalent to around {{convert|20|ktonTNT}}. The desert sand, largely made of [[silica]], melted and became a mildly radioactive light green glass, which was named [[trinitite]].{{sfn|Parekh|Semkow|Torres|Haines|2006|pp = 103–120}} It left a crater in the desert {{convert|5|ft}} deep and {{convert|30|ft}} wide.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1976|p = 11}} At the time of detonation, the surrounding mountains were illuminated &quot;brighter than daytime&quot; for one to two seconds, and the heat was reported as &quot;being as hot as an oven&quot; at the base camp. The observed colors of the illumination changed from purple to green and eventually to white. The roar of the shock wave took 40 seconds to reach the observers. It was felt over {{convert|100|mi}} away, and the [[mushroom cloud]] reached {{convert|7.5|mi}} in height.{{sfn|Smyth|1945|pp = 247–254}}

Ralph Carlisle Smith, watching from Compania Hill, wrote:{{quote|I was staring straight ahead with my open left eye covered by a welder's glass and my right eye remaining open and uncovered. Suddenly, my right eye was blinded by a light which appeared instantaneously all about without any build up of intensity. My left eye could see the ball of fire start up like a tremendous bubble or nob-like mushroom. I dropped the glass from my left eye almost immediately and watched the light climb upward. The light intensity fell rapidly hence did not blind my left eye but it was still amazingly bright. It turned yellow, then red, and then beautiful purple. At first it had a translucent character but shortly turned to a tinted or colored white smoke appearance. The ball of fire seemed to rise in something of toadstool effect. Later the column proceeded as a cylinder of white smoke; it seemed to move ponderously. A hole was punched through the clouds but two fog rings appeared well above the white smoke column. There was a spontaneous cheer from the observers. Dr. von Neumann said &quot;that was at least 5,000 tons and probably a lot more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PAO/Trinity/Pages/RalphSmithseyewitnessaccountoftheTrinitytriptowatchblast.aspx |title=Ralph Smith's eyewitness account of the Trinity trip to watch blast |publisher=White Sands Missile Range, Public Affairs Office |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In his official report on the test, Farrell wrote: {{quote|The lighting effects beggared description.

[[William L. Laurence]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' had been transferred temporarily to the Manhattan Project at Groves's request in early 1945.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp = 325–326}} Groves had arranged for Laurence to view significant events, including Trinity and the atomic bombing of Japan. Laurence wrote press releases with the help of the Manhattan Project's public relations staff.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 554}} He later recalled that {{quote|A loud cry filled the air. The little groups that hitherto had stood rooted to the earth like desert plants broke into dance, the rhythm of primitive man dancing at one of his fire festivals at the coming of Spring.{{sfn|Laurence|1946|p=14}} }}

After the initial euphoria of witnessing the explosion had passed, Bainbridge told Oppenheimer, &quot;Now we are all sons of bitches.&quot;{{sfn|Bainbridge|1975|p = 41}} Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's reaction: &quot;I'll never forget his walk;&quot; Rabi recalled, &quot;I'll never forget the way he stepped out of the car&amp;nbsp;... his walk was like ''[[High Noon]]''&amp;nbsp;... this kind of strut. He had done it.&quot;{{sfn|Monk|2012|pp = 456–457}}

[[File:Trinity test.ogg|thumb|right|Film of the Trinity test]]
Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from the [[Hindu]] holy book, the Bhagavad Gita (XI,12):
{{quote|कालोऽस्मि लोकक्षयकृत्प्रवृद्धो लोकान्समाहर्तुमिह प्रवृत्तः। ऋतेऽपि त्वां न भविष्यन्ति सर्वे येऽवस्थिताः प्रत्यनीकेषु योधाः॥११- ३२॥

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Years later he would explain that another verse had also entered his head at that time:
{{quote|We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'';  [[Vishnu]] is trying to persuade the [[Arjuna|Prince]] that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on [[Vishvarupa|his multi-armed form]] and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.'

John R. Lugo was flying a U.S. Navy transport at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}, {{convert|30|mi|km}} east of [[Albuquerque]], en route to the west coast. &quot;My first impression was, like, the sun was coming up in the south. What a ball of fire! It was so bright it lit up the cockpit of the plane.&quot; Lugo radioed Albuquerque. He got no explanation for the blast but was told, &quot;Don't fly south.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://larrycalloway.com/historic.html?_recordnum=105 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018112209/http://larrycalloway.com/historic.html?_recordnum=105 |archivedate=October 18, 2005 |date=May 10, 2005 |title=The Trinity Test: Eyewitnesses |first=Larry |last=Calloway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy measurements ===
{{see also|Nuclear weapon yield#Calculating yields and controversy}}
[[File:Trinity Test - Lead lined Sherman tank.jpg|thumb|Lead-lined Sherman tank used in Trinity test]]
The T (Theoretical) Division at Los Alamos had predicted a yield of between {{convert|5|and|10|ktonTNT}}. Immediately after the blast, the two lead-lined Sherman tanks made their way to the crater. [[nuclear weapon yield|Radiochemical analysis]] of soil samples that they collected indicated that the total yield (or energy release) had been around {{convert|18.6|ktonTNT}}.{{sfn|Widner|2009|pp = 10–24}}

Fifty beryllium-copper diaphragm microphones were also used to record the pressure of the [[blast wave]]. These were supplemented by mechanical pressure gauges.{{sfn|Widner|2009|pp = 10–12}} These indicated a blast energy of
{{convert|9.9|ktonTNT}} ± {{convert|0.1|ktonTNT}}, with only one of the mechanical pressure gauges working correctly that indicated {{convert|10|ktonTNT}}. {{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 376}}

Fermi prepared his own experiment to measure the energy that was released as blast. He later recalled that:{{quote|About 40 seconds after the explosion the air blast reached me. I tried to estimate its strength by dropping from about six feet small pieces of paper before, during, and after the passage of the blast wave. Since, at the time, there was no wind I could observe very distinctly and actually measure the displacement of the pieces of paper that were in the process of falling while the blast was passing. The shift was about 2 1/2 meters, which, at the time, I estimated to correspond to the blast that would be produced by ten thousand tons of T.N.T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dannen.com/decision/fermi.html |title=Trinity Test, July 16, 1945, Eyewitness Accounts – Enrico Fermi |publisher=Gene Dannen |accessdate=November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were also several [[gamma ray]] and [[neutron detector]]s, although few survived the blast, with all the gauges within {{convert|200|ft}} of ground zero being destroyed,{{sfn|Widner|2009|pp = 10–25}}  however sufficient data were recovered to measure the gamma ray component of the ionizing radiation released.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 375}}

The official estimate for the total yield of the Trinity gadget, which includes the energy of the blast component together with the contributions from the [[bhangmeter|explosion's light output]] and both forms of [[ionizing radiation]], is {{convert|21|ktonTNT}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtra.mil/docs/documents-ntpr-factsheets/trinity---2014.pdf?sfvrsn=0 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VDXaYUBL |archivedate=2014-12-30 |publisher=[[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] |title=Fact Sheet – Operation Trinity |accessdate=November 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which about {{convert|15|ktonTNT}} was contributed by fission of the plutonium core, and about {{convert|6|ktonTNT}} was from fission of the natural uranium tamper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/11/10/fat-mans-uranium/ |title=The Fat Man's uranium |first=Alex |last=Wellerstein |date=November 10, 2014  |publisher=Restricted Data: The Nuclear Secrecy Blog  |accessdate=November 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a re-analysis of data published in 2016 put the yield at {{convert|22.1|ktonTNT}}, with a margin of error estimated at {{convert|2.7|ktonTNT}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;pnas.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/29/8104.full |first=Susan K. |last=Hanson |first2=Anthony D. |last2=Pollington |first3=Christopher R. |last3=Waidmann |first4=William S. |last4=Kinman |first5=Allison M. |last5=Wende |first6=Jeffrey L. |last6=Miller |first7=Jennifer A. |last7=Berger |first8=Warren J. |last8=Oldham |first9=Hugh D. |last9=Selby |title=Measurements of extinct fission products in nuclear bomb debris: Determination of the yield of the Trinity nuclear test 70 y later |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=113 |issue=29 |pp=8104–8108 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1602792113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the data gathered on the size of the blast, the detonation height for the [[bombing of Hiroshima]] was set at {{convert|1885|ft}} to take advantage of the [[Blast wave#Mach Stem Formation|mach stem]] blast reinforcing effect.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 374}} The final Nagasaki burst height was {{convert|1650|ft}} so the Mach stem started sooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.rerf.jp/shared/ds02/index.html |title=Reassessment of the Atomic Bomb Radiation Dosimetry for Hiroshima and Nagasaki |publisher=Radiation Effects Research Foundation |accessdate=August 25, 2015 }} see page 47&lt;/ref&gt;  The knowledge that implosion worked led Oppenheimer to recommend to Groves that the uranium-235 used in a [[Little Boy]] gun-type weapon could be used more economically in a [[pit (nuclear weapon)|composite core with plutonium]]. It was too late to do this with the first Little Boy, but the composite cores would soon enter production.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p = 377}}

=== Civilian detection ===
Civilians noticed the bright lights and huge explosion. Groves therefore had the Second Air Force issue a press release with a cover story that he had prepared weeks before: {{quote|Alamogordo, N.M., July 16
The commanding officer of the Alamogordo Army Air Base made the following statement today: &quot;Several inquiries have been received concerning a heavy explosion which occurred on the Alamogordo Air base reservation this morning. A remotely located ammunition magazine containing a considerable amount of high explosives and pyrotechnics exploded. There was no loss of life or injury to anyone, and the property damage outside of the explosives magazine was negligible. Weather conditions affecting the content of gas shells exploded by the blast may make it desirable for the Army to evacuate temporarily a few civilians from their homes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blast Occurs At Alamogordo Air Base |newspaper=Clovis News-Journal |date=July 16, 1945|p=6 | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3985915// }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Norris|2002|p=407}} }}

The press release was written by Laurence. He had prepared four releases, covering outcomes ranging from an account of a successful test (the one which was used) to catastrophic scenarios involving serious damage to surrounding communities, evacuation of nearby residents, and a placeholder for the names of those killed.{{sfn|Sweeney|2001|pp = 205–206}}{{sfn|Laurence|1970|pp = 39–41}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Weekly Document #1: Trinity test press releases (May 1945) |url=http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2011/11/10/weekly-document-01/ | publisher=Restricted Data: The Nuclear Secrecy Blog |last=Wellerstein |first=Alex |accessdate=August 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Laurence was a witness to the test he knew that the last release, if used, might be his own obituary.{{sfn|Sweeney|2001|pp = 205–206}} A newspaper article published the same day stated that &quot;the blast was seen and felt throughout an area extending from [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] to [[Silver City, New Mexico|Silver City]], [[Gallup, New Mexico|Gallup]], Socorro, and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Army Ammunition Explosion Rocks Southwest Area |newspaper=El Paso Herald-Post |date=July 16, 1945|p=1 | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3985966// }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Associated Press]] article quoted a blind woman {{convert|150|mi}} away who asked &quot;What's that brilliant light?&quot; These articles appeared in New Mexico, but East Coast newspapers ignored them.{{sfn|Sweeney|2001|pp = 205–206}}

Information about the Trinity test was made public shortly after the [[bombing of Hiroshima]]. The [[Smyth Report]], released on August 12, 1945, gave some information on the blast, and the edition released by [[Princeton University Press]] a few weeks later incorporated the War Department's press release on the test as Appendix 6, and contained the famous pictures of a &quot;bulbous&quot; Trinity fireball.{{sfn|Smyth|1945|pp = vii–viii, 138–139, 247–254}} Groves, Oppenheimer and other dignitaries  visited the test site in September 1945, wearing white canvas overshoes to prevent fallout from sticking to the soles of their shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 17, 1945 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,854500-2,00.html |title=Science:Atomic Footprint |accessdate=March 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official notifications ===
The results of the test were conveyed to the [[Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]] at the Potsdam Conference in Germany in a coded message from his assistant [[George L. Harrison]]:
{{quote|Operated on this morning. Diagnosis not yet complete but results seem satisfactory and already exceed expectations. Local press release necessary as interest extends great distance. Dr. Groves pleased. He returns tomorrow. I will keep you posted.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=517}} }}
The message arrived at the &quot;Little White House&quot; in the Potsdam suburb of [[Babelsberg]] and was at once taken to Truman and Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes]].{{sfn|Alperovitz|Tree|1996|p = 240}} Harrison sent a follow-up message which arrived on the morning of July 18:{{sfn|Alperovitz|Tree|1996|p = 240}}
{{quote|Doctor has just returned most enthusiastic and confident that the little boy is as husky as his big brother. The light in his eyes discernible from here to High Hold and I could have heard his screams from here to my farm.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=517}} }}
Because Stimson's summer home at High Hold was on [[Long Island]] and Harrison's farm near [[Upperville, Virginia]], this indicated that the explosion could be seen {{convert|200|mi}} away and heard {{convert|50|mi}} away.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p = 518}}

=== Fallout ===
Film badges used to measure exposure to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 had been exposed to more than 0.1 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgens]], but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.{{sfn|Hacker|1987|pp = 99–101}}

[[File:Trinity Ground Zero.jpg|thumb|left|Major General [[Leslie Groves]] and [[Robert Oppenheimer]] at the Trinity shot tower remains a few weeks later. The white overshoes were to prevent the [[trinitite]] fallout from sticking to the soles of their shoes.]]
The heaviest fallout contamination outside the restricted test area was {{convert|30|mi}} from the detonation point, on Chupadera Mesa. The fallout there was reported to have settled in a white mist onto some of the livestock in the area, resulting in local [[beta burns]] and a temporary loss of [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] or back hair. Patches of hair grew back discolored white. The Army bought 75 cattle in all from [[rancher]]s; the 17 most significantly marked were kept at Los Alamos, while the rest were shipped to [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] for long-term observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lahdra.org/reports/LAHDRA%20Report%20v5%202007_App%20N_Trinity%20Test.pdf |title=Interim Report of CDC'S LAHDRA Project– Appendix N. pg 17, 23, 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;massburns&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sDQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false |page=248|title=Mass burns: proceedings of a workshop, 13–14 March 1968|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

Unlike the 100 or so atmospheric nuclear explosions later conducted at the [[Nevada Test Site]], fallout doses to the local inhabitants have not been reconstructed for the Trinity event, due primarily to scarcity of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lahdra.org/reports/LAHDRA%20Report%20v5%202007_App%20N_Trinity%20Test.pdf |title=Interim Report of CDC'S LAHDRA Project – Appendix N. pg 36 – 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a  [[National Cancer Institute]] study commenced that will attempt to close this gap in the literature and complete a Trinity [[radiation dose reconstruction]] for the population of the state of New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/exposure-assessment/trinity |title=Study of Radiation Doses and Cancer Risks Resulting from the 1945 Trinity Test |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |accessdate=January 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Santa Fe New Mexican]] |url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/downwinders-welcome-study-of-trinity-blast-s-impacts/article_830c1f00-7630-5e63-8d57-a07311978140.html |title=Sante Fe news Downwinders welcome study of Trinity blast impacts |date=January 25, 2014 |first=Dennis J. |last=Carroll|accessdate=January 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1945, shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima, the [[Kodak]] Company observed [[autoradiograph|spotting]] and [[fogging (photography)|fogging]] on their film, which was at that time usually packaged in cardboard containers. Dr. J. H. Webb, a Kodak employee, studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible due to the timing of the events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that the [[paper mill]] in [[Indiana]] used to manufacture the [[paper pulp|cardboard pulp]] from [[corn husks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ortmeyer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ieer.org/latest/iodnart.html |title=Let Them Drink Milk (Article published as &quot;Worse Than We Knew&quot;) |first1=Pat |last1=Ortmeyer |first2=Arjun |last2=Makhijani |date=November–December 1997 |journal=[[The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]  |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/hiroshimatrinity/kodakfilm.htm |title=Oak Ridge's Merril Eisenbud – Hiroshima, the Trinity Test, Nuclear Weapons.}}, discussing {{cite journal |first1=J.H. |last1=Webb |title=The Fogging of Photographic Film by Radioactive Contaminants in Cardboard Packaging Materials |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=375–380 |year=1949 |bibcode=1949PhRv...76..375W |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This incident along with the next continental US tests in 1951 set a precedent. In subsequent atmospheric nuclear tests at the [[Nevada test site]], [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] officials gave the photographic industry maps and forecasts of potential contamination, as well as expected fallout distributions, which enabled them to purchase uncontaminated materials and take other protective measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ortmeyer&quot; /&gt;

== Site today ==
In September 1953, about 650 people attended the first [[McDonald Ranch House|Trinity Site]] open house. Visitors to a Trinity Site open house are allowed to see the ground zero and McDonald Ranch House areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afterwards&quot; /&gt; More than seventy years after the test, residual radiation at the site is about ten times higher than normal [[background radiation]] in the area. The amount of radioactive exposure received during a one-hour visit to the site is about half of the total radiation exposure which a U.S. adult receives on an average day from natural and medical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PAO/Trinity/Pages/RadiationatGroundZeroJusthowradioactiveisthesite.aspx |title=Radiation at Ground Zero: Just how radioactive is the site? |publisher=White Sands Missile Range, Public Affairs Office |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special tour of the site was conducted on July 16, 1995, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Trinity test. About 5,000 visitors arrived to commemorate the occasion, the largest crowd for any open house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PAO/WSHist/Pages/ChronologyCowboystoV2stotheSpaceShuttletolasers.aspx |title= Chronology: Cowboys to V-2s to the Space Shuttle to lasers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013081400/http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PAO/WSHist/Pages/ChronologyCowboystoV2stotheSpaceShuttletolasers.aspx |archivedate=October 13, 2014 |publisher=White Sands Missile Range, Public Affairs Office |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the open houses have usually averaged two to three thousand visitors.
