[[Air Commodore]] '''Hippolyte Ferdinand (Frank) De La Rue''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (13&amp;nbsp;March 1891&amp;nbsp;– 18&amp;nbsp;May 1977) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Joining the [[Merchant Navy|Mercantile Marine]] as a youth, he became a pilot in Britain's [[Royal Naval Air Service]] during World War I. In 1918, he was given command of [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;223 Squadron]] in the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]]. The following year he took charge of [[No. 270 Squadron RAF]] in Egypt. Returning to Australia, De La Rue joined the short-lived Australian Air Corps in 1920, and became a founding member of the RAAF in March 1921. Specialising in maritime aviation, he led [[seaplane]] formations based at [[RAAF Williams|Point Cook]], Victoria, during the 1920s and early 1930s.

De La Rue was appointed commanding officer of [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at Point Cook in 1933. He was promoted to [[group captain]] in 1937 and took command of [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, the following year. At the outbreak of World War II, De La Rue was slated to lead an air expeditionary force to Great Britain, but this plan was abandoned after Australia committed itself to the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. Promoted to temporary [[air commodore]], he served as [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[Western Area Command (RAAF)|Western Area]] from 1941 to 1943, and finished the war as Inspector of Administration at RAAF Headquarters, [[Melbourne]]. Nicknamed &quot;Kanga&quot;, De La Rue retired from the Air Force in 1946, and died in 1977 at the age of eighty-six.

==Early life and World War I==
Born on 13 March 1891 in [[Auburn, New South Wales|Auburn]], a suburb of [[Sydney]], De La Rue was the son of jeweller Edmond Emile De La Rue and his wife Ellen. Following a &quot;limited&quot; education, he joined the [[Merchant Navy]] in 1908, becoming a [[Second mate|second officer]] by 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, &quot;De La Rue, Hippolyte Ferdinand&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; De La Rue transferred to the [[Royal Navy]]'s Transport Service shortly after the outbreak of World War I, operating on troop ships between England and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1965'', pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt; He saw service at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] as navigator on ''Huntsgreen'', from the Allied landings on 25 April 1915 until the withdrawal in December. In July 1916, he transferred once again, to the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) as a temporary flight sub-lieutenant, and was awarded his [[Aviator badge|wings]] in November.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Training as a [[seaplane]] pilot in [[Hampshire]], De La Rue was posted to Wales in February 1917. Later that year, he claimed an unconfirmed sinking of a German submarine while on coastal patrol. Promoted [[flight lieutenant]] in January 1918, De La Rue became an honorary [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) that April, following the merger of the RNAS and the [[Royal Flying Corps]]. He was posted to [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;223 Squadron]] in [[Otranto]], Italy, later taking command of the unit. While piloting a [[Short Brothers|Short]] seaplane escorting Allied bombers on a raid against the port city of [[Durrës]], Albania, he rescued the crew of another seaplane that had been forced down in the Austrian-held harbour. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his actions, as well as the Italian [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==Between the wars==
De La Rue was posted to [[Alexandria]], Egypt, in January 1919 to command [[No. 270 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;270 (Seaplane) Squadron]]. Offered a permanent commission in the RAF that August, he nevertheless returned to Australia and sought employment through Lieutenant Colonel [[Stanley Goble]], an ex-RNAS pilot then seconded to the Navy Office. Goble, desiring a specialist seaplane pilot for naval cooperation work, arranged a captain's commission in the recently established Australian Air Corps, successor to the wartime [[Australian Flying Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June 1920, in an [[Airco DH.9]], De La Rue accompanied Captain [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] on a flight to an altitude of {{convert|27000|ft|m}}, setting an Australian record that stood for more than ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, flying an [[Avro 504]]L [[floatplane]], he became the first person to land an aircraft on the [[Yarra River]] in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Military Aircraft of Australia'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  In July he was put in charge of trials of the Avro 504L aboard the [[Royal Australian Navy]]'s flagship, [[HMAS Australia (1911)|HMAS ''Australia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/unsworks:3183/SOURCE02?view=true ''The Eagle and the Albatross'', p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; De La Rue joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) as a flight lieutenant in 1921, becoming one of the original twenty-one officers on its strength when it was formed (as the Australian Air Force) that March.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/01.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Going by the first name of Frank, he was also popularly known throughout the service as &quot;Kanga&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.35&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 31, 334&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1921, he underwent the RAAF's &quot;No.&amp;nbsp;1 Course&quot; at the [[Australian Army]]'s Central Training Depot in [[Holsworthy Barracks|Holsworthy]], New South Wales; his fellow inductees included [[Flying Officer]]s [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], [[Arthur William Murphy|Arthur Murphy]], and [[Raymond Brownell]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avro504L1920.jpg|thumb|left|300px|In an Avro 504L, Flight Lieutenant De La Rue makes the first seaplane landing on the Yarra River, Victoria, June 1920|alt=Three-quarter rear view of biplane on floats, taxiing along a stretch of water towards shore]]
During the 1920s, De La Rue held a series of postings at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria, and at Air Force Headquarters, Melbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; In May 1922, then in charge of the Seaplane Flight, he crashed an Avro 504L into [[Port Phillip]]; his rescuers claimed that his main concern following the mishap was the state of the [[corduroy]] trousers he was wearing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.35&quot;/&gt; He lost the RAAF's sole [[Bristol Scout]] in another accident less than a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; De La Rue married Clara Stone in a [[Presbyterian]] ceremony at Scots Church, Melbourne, on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1923; the couple would have a daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He had another escape in August 1925 when he crashed a [[Sopwith Pup]] into a hangar; a witness said that De La Rue, who was &quot;renowned for his fiery [[French people|Gallic]] temper&quot;, strode from the wreckage and began to violently abuse the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; By 1926, he was the examining officer on the [[flight instructor]]s course at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS), Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; On exchange in Britain during 1929–30, De La Rue underwent familiarisation with [[aircraft carrier]]s, and served on the staff of [[No. 201 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;201 (Flying Boat) Squadron]], based on the south coast of England. Upon his return to Australia in 1931, he was given command of the RAAF's [[Seaplane Squadron RAAF|Seaplane Squadron]] at Point Cook. Promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in December 1932, De La Rue led No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS from early 1933. He was promoted [[group captain]] in January 1937,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; and took over as commanding officer (CO) of [[RAAF Base Richmond|Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, from Group Captain Cole in January the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
De La Rue and his staff at Headquarters Richmond worked &quot;flat out&quot; in the days prior the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II to get the base to a fit state of readiness and, immediately after hostilities were declared on 3&amp;nbsp;September, to liaise with the Central War Room in Melbourne passing instructions to squadrons. The following day, Richmond's first wartime [[sortie]] took place, a flight of three [[Avro Anson]]s and three [[Supermarine Seagull (1921)|Supermarine Seagull]]s patrolling the ocean off Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS), Air Vice Marshal Goble, proposed despatching a six-squadron air expeditionary force to Great Britain, with De La Rue, then the RAAF's seventh most senior officer, in charge. Air Marshal [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], Goble's long-time rival for leadership of the Air Force in the 1920s and '30s, later contended that the CAS was unduly favouring his fellow RNAS veteran and seaplane specialist to lead what would have been the RAAF's largest formation to date, particularly considering that other contenders for the role such as Group Captains Cole, [[Frank Hubert McNamara|Frank McNamara]], and [[Henry Wrigley]] had greater landplane experience than De La Rue. The concept was in any case abandoned soon after, as Australia concentrated on participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 456–458&lt;/ref&gt; Some time in the latter half of 1940, De La Rue was seeing dinner guests off the base at RAAF Richmond, and attempted to re-enter the perimeter via the main gate. Wearing civilian clothes and without his security pass, he was challenged and then locked up by the guards, who did not recognise him or believe his assurances that he was their commander. De La Rue was finally released by the orderly officer but was still fuming the next morning; only the advice of the base [[Warrant officer|warrant officer (disciplinary)]], who had congratulated the guards on their diligence, prevented the CO from taking action against all concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An010702DeLaRue1941.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Air Commodore De La Rue (in braided cap) inspecting RAAF flying school trainees, c. 1941|alt=Two columns of men, some in military uniforms with peaked caps, some in civilian clothes, walking between two rows of troops with forage caps standing to attention with rifles and fixed bayonets, and further rows of troops behind them]]
After completing his tenure at Richmond, De La Rue briefly took the role of senior air staff officer (SASO) at [[Central Area Command (RAAF)|Central Area Command]] in October 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; The following month, his name was put forward to establish an RAAF depot in London to look after the interests of the many thousands of Australian airmen disembarking there, but financial considerations led to the plan being scuppered temporarily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.113&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 113]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/05.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', pp. 108–110]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, RAAF Overseas Headquarters would be formed on 1&amp;nbsp;December 1941, with Air Marshal Williams appointed [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC).&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp. 113–116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', pp. 118–120&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, De La Rue also missed out on a potential posting to the Middle East that was suggested by the British but turned down by the Australian government. Promoted acting [[air commodore]], he became the inaugural AOC [[Western Area Command (RAAF)|Western Area]], headquartered in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], on 9&amp;nbsp;January 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Among the units he controlled in this position were [[No. 14 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;14 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron]], [[No. 25 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;25 (General Purpose) Squadron]], [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;35 (Transport) Squadron]], and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 (Fighter) Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; De La Rue worked assiduously to prepare the latter for operations, as it was the only fighter squadron able to defend Perth and [[Fremantle]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; He also lobbied RAAF Headquarters for a force of long-range [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalina]] flying boats to augment the [[Lockheed Hudson]]s of No.&amp;nbsp;14 Squadron, but none were offered to him.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/unsworks:3183/SOURCE04?view=true ''The Eagle and the Albatross'', pp. 72–73]&lt;/ref&gt; De La Rue was made a temporary air commodore in July 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; By February 1942, he was the eighth most senior officer in the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power With Attitude'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Handing over Western Area Command to Air Commodore Ray Brownell in January 1943, De La Rue became Inspector of Administration at RAAF Headquarters, in which post he saw out the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.113&quot;/&gt; On 8&amp;nbsp;June 1944, he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=379341 Awarded: Commander of the Order of the British Empire] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 17 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
De La Rue was summarily retired from the RAAF after the war, along with a number of other senior commanders and veterans of World War&amp;nbsp;I, partly to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers, and also due to his suspect health. In recommending early retirement, the CAS, Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], noted that De La Rue possessed &quot;fairly good Service knowledge&quot; and was of strong character, but that &quot;sometimes his efforts [were] ill-directed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.179&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 179–181&lt;/ref&gt; De La Rue was, furthermore, above the statutory retiring age for his substantive rank of group captain.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power With Attitude'', p.  92&lt;/ref&gt; He was officially discharged on 1&amp;nbsp;April 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1204619 De La Rue, Hippolyte Ferdinand] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War 2 Nominal roll]. Retrieved on 17 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An honorary air commodore from 1956, his chief hobby in retirement was [[Watercolor painting|painting in water colours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; On 31&amp;nbsp;March 1971, he was among a select group of surviving foundation members who attended a celebratory dinner at the [[Hotel Canberra]] to mark the RAAF's [[Golden Jubilee]]; his fellow guests included Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams, Air Vice Marshals Henry Wrigley and [[William Anderson (RAAF officer)|Bill Anderson]], and Wing Commander [[Lawrence Wackett|Sir Lawrence Wackett]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 451, 498&lt;/ref&gt; Frank De La Rue died at his home in [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]], a suburb of Melbourne, on 18&amp;nbsp;May 1977. He was survived by his daughter, and cremated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;
