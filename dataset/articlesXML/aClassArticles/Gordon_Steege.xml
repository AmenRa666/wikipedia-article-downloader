[[Air Commodore]] '''Gordon Henry Steege''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (31&amp;nbsp;October 1917&amp;nbsp;– 1&amp;nbsp;September 2013) was a senior officer in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He became a [[flying ace|fighter ace]] in World War&amp;nbsp;II, credited with eight aerial victories. Joining the RAAF in July 1937, Steege first saw action with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre|Middle East]], where he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] after shooting down three German aircraft in a single [[sortie]]. He rose to command [[No. 450 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;450 Squadron]] in the [[Desert Air Force]], before being posted to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]], where he led [[No. 73 Wing RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;73]] and [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|81&amp;nbsp;Wings]]. He earned the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his &quot;outstanding leadership&quot;, and finished the war a temporary [[group captain]].

Resigning his commission following the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II, Steege rejoined the RAAF during the [[Korean War]], and briefly took command of [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron]] late in 1951. Returning to Australia, he held senior administrative and training posts before taking charge of [[Fairbairn, Canberra|RAAF Base Canberra]] in 1957. In the 1960s he was appointed to various planning positions, followed by command of [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland, and later [[RMAF Butterworth|RAAF Base Butterworth]], Malaysia. Having been raised to air commodore, his final appointment before retiring in 1972 was on the staff of Headquarters Operational Command (now [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]) at [[RAAF Base Glenbrook]], New South Wales. He subsequently became an aeronautical consultant, and died in Sydney in 2013, aged 95.

==Early career==
The son of William and Ida Steege, Gordon Henry Steege was born in the Sydney suburb of [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]] on 31&amp;nbsp;October 1917, and educated at [[North Sydney Boys High School]].&lt;ref name=Chisholm&gt;Chisholm, ''Who's Who in Australia 1947'', p. 780&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite news|last=Llewelyn|first=Ken|title=Air ace decorated for daring feats|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|location=Canberra|date=9 September 2013|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/comment/obituaries/air-ace-decorated-for-daring-feats-20130908-2tdu9.html#ixzz2eowaQ2RY|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled having always been interested in a military career, applying unsuccessfully to enter the [[Royal Australian Navy]] when he was twelve, and the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], after he left school and started working with the [[Perpetual Limited|Perpetual Trustee Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Steege; Llewellyn, &quot;Oral history recording&quot;, Cassette 1/Side A&lt;/ref&gt; On 21&amp;nbsp;July 1937, he joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), undergoing flight instruction at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] in [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria.&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_8291.asp|title= Air Commodore Gordon Henry Steege|publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate= 5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WW2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1081196 |title=Steege, Gordon Henry|work=World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate= 5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a distinguished pass on 23&amp;nbsp;June 1938, and was commissioned a [[pilot officer]].&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article35591080 |title=RAAF graduates receive badges|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=24 June 1938 |accessdate=5 September 2013 |page=14 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first posting was to [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, flying [[Hawker Hart#Demon|Hawker Demon]] biplane fighters.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 46, 123&lt;/ref&gt; Steege and the squadron participated in several exercises with the [[Australian Army]], undertaking reconnaissance, spotting for artillery, and practising ground-attack missions.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[flying officer]] in December 1938.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

==World War II==
Following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II in September 1939, Steege was appointed [[adjutant]] of the newly formed [[No. 11 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Squadron]], which initially operated two [[Short Brothers|Short Type&amp;nbsp;C]] flying boats requisitioned from [[Qantas Empire Airways]]. Half of the squadron's personnel were Qantas employees.&lt;ref name=Chisholm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; On 25&amp;nbsp;September, No.&amp;nbsp;11 Squadron became the RAAF's first unit to be based in Papua New Guinea, when the flying boats, accompanied by Steege in a [[De Havilland Dragon Rapide]], flew to [[Port Moresby]] to undertake maritime reconnaissance in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/03.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 66]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Steege returned to No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in May 1940, was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] the following month, and shipped out to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]] with his unit on 15&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11023second_world_war.asp |title=3 Squadron RAAF|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piloting a [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane, he achieved his first aerial victory in the [[North African campaign]] when he shot down an Italian [[Fiat CR.42]] on 10&amp;nbsp;December 1940; he also claimed a &quot;probable&quot; in the same action.&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gladiator&gt;Thomas, ''Gloster Gladiator Aces'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later he shared in three more &quot;kills&quot;: two CR.42s and a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]].&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt; After No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron converted to [[Hawker Hurricane]]s, Steege shot down three [[Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;87]]s in a single sortie near [[Mersa Matruh]] on 18&amp;nbsp;February 1941, to become his unit's second [[flying ace|ace]]. Following this exploit, and the destruction of a [[Messerschmitt Bf&amp;nbsp;110]] on 3&amp;nbsp;April, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Hurricane Aces 1941–45'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation noted his &quot;unfailing courage&quot;, and the award was promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 11&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00203/002030768.pdf |title=Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue= 35131 |startpage=2041|date=8 April 1941|accessdate=on 26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised to [[Acting (rank)|acting]] [[squadron leader]], Steege was given command of the newly arrived [[No. 450 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;450 Squadron]] at [[Rayak (Riyaq)|Rayak]], Lebanon, on 31&amp;nbsp;May 1941.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/03.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 95]&lt;/ref&gt; The assignment was a challenging one, as the operational requirements of existing forces, and the RAAF Air Board's insistence on staffing [[Article&amp;nbsp;XV squadrons]] such as No.&amp;nbsp;450 with Australian [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] aircrew rather than Permanent Air Force members, meant that the unit was short of experienced pilots.&lt;ref name=Herington&gt;Herington, ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', pp. 96–99&lt;/ref&gt; Steege was [[mentioned in despatches]] on 24&amp;nbsp;September 1941 for his leadership of the squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35284|supp=yes|startpage=5569|endpage=5573|date=24 September 1941|accessdate=on 26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?iid=81198#folio=20|title=He lived his life to the full|work=[[Air Force (newspaper)|Air Force]]|last=Llewelyn|first=Ken|date=12 September 2013|page=20|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December, it was at nominal strength and equipped with [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Kittyhawks]]; it commenced combat operations out of [[RAF Gambut|Gambut]] and [[Gamal Abdul El Nasser Air Base|El&amp;nbsp;Adem]], Libya, and began registering victories in February 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/09.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 218]&lt;/ref&gt; Steege himself scored a confirmed victory over a [[Messerschmitt Bf&amp;nbsp;109]] on 28&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; His final tally in the Middle Eastern theatre was eight enemy aircraft destroyed, two probables and five damaged.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Thomas, ''Hurricane Aces 1941–45'', p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Australia a temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in December 1942.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;

Steege undertook a fighter sector course in January 1943, and was given command of No.&amp;nbsp;8 Fighter Sector Headquarters in [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; As a result, he later contended, of his petitioning [[Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|Eastern Area Command]] for reassignment to combat duties and complaining to Group Officer [[Clare Stevenson]] that there were too many [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force|WAAAFs]] in the sector for an unmarried man to supervise, he was posted to command [[No. 114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;14 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters]] at [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], New South Wales, on 23&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref&gt;Steege; Llewellyn, &quot;Oral history recording&quot;, Cassette 3/Side A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Units&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Radar Units'', pp. 131–137&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the unit deployed to [[Goodenough Island]] in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] as part of [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 (Fighter) Wing]], becoming operational on 27&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; In August it moved to [[Kiriwina]], under the aegis of [[No. 73 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;73 (Fighter) Wing]]. Steege relinquished command on 1&amp;nbsp;October to take charge of No.&amp;nbsp;73 Wing.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; The wing's combat units consisted of two P-40 Kittyhawk squadrons and a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/05.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the build-up to the [[Battle of Arawe]] in December, the Kittyhawks launched a series of assaults on [[Gasmata]]; three days before the Allied landings, Steege personally led a force of thirty-four aircraft in a bombing and strafing attack on the town's landing strip.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/08.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 126]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1944, the wing took part in the two largest raids mounted by the RAAF to that time, each involving over seventy aircraft attacking enemy camps and depots at Lindenhafen, [[New Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/08.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 130–131]&lt;/ref&gt; Steege was promoted acting [[group captain]] the following month; the rank was made temporary in July.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

As part of the RAAF's contribution to the [[Admiralty Islands campaign]], Steege led No.&amp;nbsp;73 Wing on garrison duty at [[Los Negros]], commencing in March 1944. The wing's combat squadrons—[[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;76]], [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77]] and [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|79]]—were supported by No.&amp;nbsp;49 Operational Base Unit, No.&amp;nbsp;114 Mobile Fighter Sector (formerly No.&amp;nbsp;14 Mobile Fighter Sector), No.&amp;nbsp;27 Air Stores Park and No.&amp;nbsp;26 Medical Clearing Station, among other ancillaries.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers170&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/11.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 170–177]&lt;/ref&gt; The fighters' main duty was providing cover for Allied shipping; they also carried out bomber escort, ground attack and anti-shipping missions.&lt;ref name=Odgers170/&gt; In mid-April, the wing escorted the largest Allied convoy in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] to that date, 80 ships carrying 30,000 personnel, from [[Finschhafen]] to [[Aitape]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/13.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 209]&lt;/ref&gt; On 11&amp;nbsp;April, Steege was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his &quot;outstanding leadership in aerial combat in New Guinea&quot;.&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36463|supp=yes|startpage=1674|date=11 April 1944|accessdate=on 26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing their garrison work in the Admiralties that June, No.&amp;nbsp;73 Wing's Kittyhawk units were transferred to [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 (Fighter) Wing]] on [[Noemfoor]] under Steege's command. In September 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing became part of No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group, which was renamed the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/15.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 249]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/17.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 299]&lt;/ref&gt; During October and November, No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing undertook offensive sweeps and ground attacks against targets in [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], and dive bombed Japanese airfields on [[Halmahera]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/18.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 304, 307–308, 312]&lt;/ref&gt; Steege handed over command of the wing to Group Captain [[Wilfred Arthur|Wilf Arthur]] in December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/23.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 388]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1945, Steege became senior air staff officer (SASO) at Eastern Area Command in Sydney. He was posted to RAAF Headquarters, [[Melbourne]], in May.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt; From June to December, he attended the [[National War College|Army and Navy Staff College]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=Chisholm/&gt;

Steege married Joan Tait on 5&amp;nbsp;January 1946; they had a son and a daughter. He was appointed RAAF Director of Operations in February.&lt;ref name=Chisholm/&gt;  In December 1946, he resigned from the RAAF, joining the New Guinea Administration as a patrol officer the next month. He rejoined the Air Force as a wing commander on the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt; The following month, he accompanied Major General [[William Bridgeford]]'s [[Malayan Emergency|mission to Malaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44928355 |title=Military mission to Malaya |newspaper=The Advertiser |location=Adelaide |date=22 July 1950 |accessdate=5 September 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steege assumed command of [[RAAF Station Schofields]], New South Wales, in September 1950, and commenced a jet training course at [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAAF Station Williamtown]] early the next year.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt; On 16&amp;nbsp;August 1951, he was posted to [[Kimpo]], South Korea, as commander of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, shortly after its conversion from [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] piston-engined fighters to [[Gloster Meteor]] jets. One of his first actions, following discussions with the US [[Fifth Air Force]], was to take the Australian unit out of its then-current air-to-air combat role, and curtail its operations in &quot;[[MiG Alley]]&quot;. Two encounters between No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron and Chinese [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]]s had convinced Steege that the straight-winged Meteors were outclassed as fighters by the swept-wing MiGs. His decision caused controversy as some [[United Nations|UN]] commanders believed that proper training and tactics would have allowed the Meteor to remain competitive as a fighter, while for the Australian pilots the change of role amounted to a loss of prestige.&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 236–237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Combat Operations'', p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; However, Steege was backed up by the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], and the squadron was relegated mainly to escort duty and local air defence. Morale suffered and it was not until after Steege's departure on 26&amp;nbsp;December that a suitable offensive role was again found for the Meteors, namely ground attack.&lt;ref name=Stephens/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to Australia, Steege was appointed chief instructor at the School of Land/Air Warfare, Williamtown, in February 1952. He was attached to the [[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]] in [[Canberra]] for two years beginning in August 1953, holding secretarial posts on the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Joint Planning Committee, and Defence Committee.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=News1953&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article103123881 |title=Gp Capt Steege appointed to SEATO planners |newspaper=The Canberra Times |location=Canberra |date=15 October 1958 |accessdate=5 September 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving on the staff of [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Headquarters Training Command]] from August 1955 to May 1957, he took command of [[Fairbairn, Canberra|RAAF Base Canberra]], Australian Capital Territory.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt; At this time [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing]], operating [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakotas]] and [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 440 Metropolitain]]s, was located at Canberra, in part to satisfy the Federal government's [[Very Important Person|VIP]] transport needs.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 416, 426&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Steege was promoted to acting group captain in May 1958 ([[Military rank#Types of rank|substantive]] two months later), before becoming a senior planner at the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]] Military Planning Office, Bangkok, in December 1958.
