==Related to H class?==

Nazi Germany, ally of Imperial Japan, also planned a giant battleship with 20&quot; guns.  Perhaps these two parallel projects from two allied nations were somehow linked?
:No, they were definitely not linked. The German battleship you are talking about was the 1944 design of the [[H class battleship (1944)|H Class Battleship]], which itself was just an enlarged version of the [[H class battleship (1939)|1939 H Class]] design. Two ships of the latter had been laid down early in 1939, but construction was cancelled shortly after the war had broken out. [[User:Ulsterman|Ulsterman]] 22:47, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

== Rephrased comparison of shell weight ==

The comparison section is very well done, except for a minor bit of phrasing which I corrected. In reality the ''Iowa'' class wasn't only the most &quot;powerful&quot; ''American'' battleship behind the ''Yamato''s, it was '''''the''''' most &quot;powerful&quot;. (I put powerful in quotes because targeting, speed, and armor determine a good battleship too.) [[User:Anynobody|Anynobody]] 09:00, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

:One thing I'll point out while I'm here is the weight of broadside/rate of fire issue. From [[List of broadsides of major World War II ships]], we can take the Yamato's weight of fire at 28,971 tons, at 1.5 per minute. So, in 2 minutes, Yamato would fire 3 salvoes, totalling 86,373 tons. Iowa has a weight of fire of 24,300 tons, at 2 salvoes per minute. So, in 2 minutes, Iowa would fire 4 salvoes at 97,200 tons, over 10,000 tons greater than Yamato's. Add onto that superior American gunnery control, radar, etc.. Who outguns who now?

yo i said out guns like as in nuber of guns including ainti-aircraft,etc the yamato wins in sheer firepower plus 1.5 salvos per minute .. is that possible? can you fire half a salvo or would you quickly load the rest of the guns. but still the japanese were like atoumated machiens arboard their battle ships so it think the yamato could avarege the 2 salvos per minute set by the iwoa plus like howmany years were in between the iwo and yamato i mean the yamto was a god in its time the amiracans feard it and thats why the built the um..iwoa class but the yamato was sunk before the were completed by a massive air attack by three carriers and i think it took like 13 (i am problay wrong about the number) derect hits before it was sunk. could the iwoa take the same amount of punishment and live?--[[User:ANOMALY-117|ANOMALY-117]] ([[User talk:ANOMALY-117|talk]]) 17:59, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
ha the the yamato took direct hits form more then 10,000 pounds of bombs and keep goin like it was nothin the oly thing that can and did sink the ship is the amircan forsight to use the airplane at see not the battleship not to mention the other two ships in the yamato class although one was scrpped to make an aircrft carrier because the japs finnaly relised that planes not battleships would win the war. --[[User:ANOMALY-117|ANOMALY-117]] ([[User talk:ANOMALY-117|talk]]) 18:02, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
what about range does the yamato fire father then the iwoa plus the  yamato has a bigger beam and more antiaircraft guns and i think the iwo couldn't hold it's own against three aircraft carriers for as long as the yamato did.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:ANOMALY-117|ANOMALY-117]] ([[User talk:ANOMALY-117|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/ANOMALY-117|contribs]]) 18:06, 2 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::&quot;As it was, the United States built ten battleships (the North Carolina-, South Dakota-, and Iowa-class battleships), while the Japanese completed just two.&quot; This is not true, japanese had two Yamato class battleships, but many more other classes of battleships. If you compare, Yamato is not comperable with Iowa or King george V. Both these ships are around 50k tons, yamato is 72k tons. If Montana battleships were built, they would be compatitors to Yamato. It is like comparing todays Kirov cruiser with Ticonderoga cruiser. For the arguement above, I dont think it is irrelevant to the article as it contains a section called &quot;competition&quot;.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/88.254.242.29|88.254.242.29]] ([[User talk:88.254.242.29|talk]]) 02:07, 21 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Construction section, last sentence ==

Sentence reads:
However, the war's turn against the Japanese after the Battle of Midway meant that the need for ships other than battleships never abated.

Suggest that the author intended this:
However, the war's turn against the Japanese after the Battle of Midway meant that the need for ships other than carriers never abated.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/67.160.227.99|67.160.227.99]] ([[User talk:67.160.227.99|talk]]) 13:07, 22 July 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== A-150 not to be armed with 8 x 20&quot; main battery ==

The article is incorrect in stating that these ships were to be armed with 8 20&quot; guns. As Garzke &amp; Dulin and other sources note, it was just 6 20&quot; in three turrets. The article correctly notes that 8-9 main guns were rejected because the ships would have been too big. Each twin 20&quot; turret weighed about the same as the Yamatos' triple 18.1&quot;, so the super Yamatos of the same displacement could not carry more than three turrets either. (It is probable that all the Yamatos would have been regunned with 6 20&quot; in the mid 1940s.) I have never seen it explained how the A-150s would have been more heavily armored than the Yamatos despite being the same displacement.
