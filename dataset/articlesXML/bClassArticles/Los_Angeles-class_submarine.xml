[[File:Sub Noise Comparison ENG.svg|thumb|Acoustic stealth comparison]]
The '''''Los Angeles'' class''' (also known as the '''688 class''') is a class of [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[fast attack submarine]]s ([[hull classification symbol|SSN]]) in service with the [[United States Navy]]. They represent two generations and close to half a century of the U.S. Navy's attack submarine fleet. As of 2016, 36 of the class are still in commission and 26 retired from service. Of the 26 retired boats, 14 of them were laid up half way (approximately 17–18 years) through their projected lifespans due to their midlife reactor refuelings being cancelled. A further four boats were proposed by the Navy, but later cancelled. The class has more operating nuclear submarines than any other in the world. All submarines of this class are named after American towns and cities (e.g., Key West, Florida, and Greeneville, Tennessee), the exception being {{USS|Hyman G. Rickover|SSN-709}}. This system of naming broke a long-standing tradition in the U.S. Navy of naming attack submarines for creatures of the ocean (e.g., {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571}}).

In 1982 after building 31 boats, the class underwent a minor redesign, the following 8 that made up the second &quot;flight&quot; of subs had 12 new vertical launch tubes that could fire Tomahawk missiles. The last 23 saw a significant upgrade with the '''688i''' improvement program. These boats are quieter, with more advanced electronics, sensors, and noise reduction technology. Externally they can be recognized quickly as the retractable [[diving plane]]s are placed at the bow rather than on the sail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-five-best-submarines-all-time-9728 |title=The Five Best Submarines of All Time |first=Robert |last=Farley |work=[[The National Interest]] |date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capabilities===
[[File:LA sub1.jpg|left|thumb|Crewmen monitor consoles at the diving station aboard a Los Angeles class submarine|300px]]
According to the [[U.S. Department of Defense]], the top speed of the submarines of the ''Los Angeles'' class is over {{convert|25|kn|lk=in}}, although the actual maximum is classified. Some published estimates have placed their top speed at {{convert|30|to|33|kn}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polmar&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Polmar |first=Norman |last2=Moore |first2=Kenneth J. |title=Cold War Submarines: The Design and Construction of U.S. and Soviet Submarines |page=271 |publisher=Brassey's |year=2003 |isbn=1-57488-594-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyler |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick_Tyler |title=Running Critical |publisher=Harper and Row |year=1986 |location=New York |pages=24, 56, 66–67 |isbn=978-0-06-091441-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Submarine: A Guided Tour Inside a Nuclear Warship'', [[Tom Clancy]] estimated the top speed of ''Los Angeles''-class submarines at about {{convert|37|kn}}.

The U.S. Navy gives the maximum operating depth of the ''Los Angeles'' class as {{convert|650|ft|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waddle |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Waddle |title=The Right Thing |publisher=Integrity Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=1-59145-036-5 |pages=xi (map/diagram) |quote=This reference is for operating depth only}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Patrick Tyler]], in his book ''Running Critical'', suggests a maximum operating depth of {{convert|950|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, (1986). pp. 66–67, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Although Tyler cites the 688-class design committee for this figure,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Notes in pp. 64–67: Deliberations of ad-hoc committee on SSN 688 design taken from confidential sources and from interviews with Admiral [Ret] Rickover. ...&quot; From Tyler, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; the government has not commented on it. The maximum diving depth is {{convert|1475|ft|m|abbr=on}} according to ''Jane's Fighting Ships, 2004–2005 Edition'', edited by Commodore Stephen Saunders of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, (2004). pp. 838&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapons===

''Los Angeles''-class submarines carry about 25 torpedo tube-launched weapons, as well as Mark 67 and Mark 60 CAPTOR mines and were designed to launch [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s, and [[Harpoon (missile)|Harpoon missiles]] horizontally (from the torpedo tubes). The last 31 boats of this class also have 12 dedicated [[vertical launching system]] (VLS) tubes for launching Tomahawks.

===Control systems===
Over close to forty years the control suite of the class has changed dramatically. The class was originally equipped with the Mk 113 mod 10 Fire control system, also known as the Pargo display program. The Mk 113 runs on a [[AN/UYK-7|UYK-7]] computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. Submarines Since 1945: An Illustrated Design History|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vipclubmn.org/sysnavy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mk 117 FCS, the first &quot;all [[Digital electronics|digital]]&quot; [[fire control system]] replaced the Mk 113.  The Mk 117 transferred the duties of the analog Mk 75 attack director to the UYK-7, and the digital Mk 81 weapon control consoles, removing the two analog conversions, and allowing &quot;all digital&quot; control of the digital mk 48 control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friednam|first1=Norman|title=The Naval Institute Guide to World Naval Weapons Systems, 1997-1998|date=1997|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=9781557502681|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first 688 sub to be built with the Mk 117 was SSN-700, {{USS|Dallas|SSN-700|6}}.

The Mark 1 Combat Control System/All Digital Attack Center replaced the Mk 117 FCS which it was based on. The Mk 1 CCS was built by [[Lockheed Martin]], and gave the class the ability to fire [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk missiles]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/mk-1-css.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The CSS internal tracker model provides [[Electronic data processing|processing]] for both [[Towed array sonar|towed array]] and spherical array trackers. [[Sonar|Trackers]] are signal followers which generate bearing, arrival angle and frequency reports based on information received by an acoustic sensor. It incorporated the Gyro Static Navigator into the system in replacement of the DMINS of the earlier 688 class.

The Mk 1 CCS was replaced by the Mk 2. The Mk 2 was built by [[Raytheon]].  Mk 2 provides Tomahawk Block III [[Vertical launching system|vertical launch]] capability as well as fleet-requested improvements to [[Mark 48 torpedo|Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo]] and Towed Array Target Motion Analysis (TMA) operability. The Mk 2 CCS paired with the AN/BQQ-5E system is referred to as the &quot;QE-2&quot; system. The CCS MK2 Block 1 A/B system architecture extends the CCS MK2 tactical system with a network of Tactical Advanced Computers (TAC-3). These TAC-3s are configured to support the SFMPL, NTCS-A, LINK-11 and ATWCS subsystems.

===Sensors===

====Sonar====

=====AN/BQQ-5=====
AN/BQQ-5 sensor suite consists of the AN/BQS-13 spherical sonar array and AN/UYK-44 computer. The AN/BQQ-5 was developed from the AN/BQQ-2 sonar system. The BQS 11, 12, and 13 spherical arrays have 1,241 transducers. Also equipped are a 104 hydrophone hull array and two towed arrays: the TB-12 (later replaced by the TB-16) and TB-23 or TB-29, of which there are multiple variants. There are 5 versions of the AN/BQQ-5 system, sequentially identified by letters A-E.

The 688i (Improved) subclass was initially equipped with the AN/BSY-1 SUBACS submarine advanced combat system that used an AN/BQQ-5E sensor system with updated computers and interface equipment. Development of the AN/BSY-1 and its sister the AN/BSY-2 for the {{sclass-|Seawolf|submarine|4}} was widely reported as one of the most problematic programs for the Navy, its cost and schedule suffering many setbacks.

A series of conformal passive hydrophones are hard-mounted to each side of the hull, using the AN/BQR-24 internal processor. The system uses FLIT (frequency line integration tracking) which homes in on precise narrowband frequencies of sound and, using the Doppler principle, can accurately provide firing solutions against very quiet submarines. The AN/BQQ-5’s hull array doubled the performance of its predecessors.

=====AN/BQQ-10=====
The AN/BQQ-5 system was replaced by the AN/BQQ-10 system. Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-The-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI), designated AN/BQQ-10, is a four-phase program for transforming existing submarine sonar systems (AN/BSY-1, AN/BQQ-5, and AN/BQQ-6) from legacy systems to a more capable and flexible COTS/Open System Architecture (OSA) and also provide the submarine force with a common sonar system. A single A-RCI Multi-Purpose Processor (MPP) has as much computing power as the entire ''Los Angeles'' (SSN-688/688I) submarine fleet combined and will allow the development and use of complex algorithms previously beyond the reach of legacy processors. The use of COTS/OSA technologies and systems will enable rapid periodic updates to both software and hardware. COTS-based processors will allow computer power growth at a rate commensurate with the commercial industry.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/an-bqq-10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering and auxiliary systems===
Two watertight compartments are used in the ''Los Angeles''-class submarines. The forward compartment contains crew living spaces, weapons-handling spaces, and control spaces not critical to recovering propulsion. The aft compartment contains the bulk of the submarine's engineering systems, power generation turbines, and water-making equipment.&lt;ref&gt;SSN-688 ''Los Angeles'' Class Design. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/ssn-688-design.htm Los Angeles Class] at Globalsecurity.org.  Accessed on 7 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Some submarines in the class are capable of delivering [[SEAL]]s through either the [[Dry Deck Shelter|dry deck shelter]] system or the [[Advanced SEAL Delivery System|advanced SEAL delivery system]] (program canceled in 2006 and rendered unusable in 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Moore, (2003).  pp. 263&lt;/ref&gt;  A variety of atmospheric control devices are used to allow the vessel to remain submerged for long periods of time without ventilating, including an [[Electrolytic cell|electrolytic]] [[oxygen generator]], which produces oxygen for the crew and hydrogen as a byproduct. The hydrogen is pumped overboard but there is always a risk of fire or explosion from this process.&lt;ref name=fas /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treadwell Supplies Oxygen Generator Components for Nuclear Subs [http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/treadwell-supplies-oxygen-generator-components-for-nuclear-subs-2-04690/ Defense Industry Daily] 28-January-2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Greeneville (SSN-772).jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|Greeneville|SSN-772|6}} with an attached [[Advanced SEAL Delivery System|ASDS]]]]
While on the surface or at snorkel depth, the submarine may use the submarine's auxiliary or emergency [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel generator]] for power or ventilation&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks Morse Engines [http://www.fairbanksmorse.com/installations_marine.php Marine Installations] Accessed on 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auxiliary Division on USS Cheyenne [https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/unit/dept-ssn-773.htm#ENGINEERING%20DEPARTMENT USS CHEYENNE SSN-773 Department &amp; Divisions] from [[Federation of American Scientists]]. Accessed on 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., following a fire).&lt;ref&gt;Firefighting and Damage Control Update [http://www.dcfp.navy.mil/library/dcra/181044ZJUN98.htm 181044Z JUN 98 (SUBS) Message] [[COMSUBLANT]] (1998) Accessed on 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The diesel engine in a 688 class can be quickly started by compressed air during emergencies or to evacuate noxious (nonvolatile) gases from the boat, although 'ventilation' requires raising a snorkel mast. During nonemergency situations, design constraints call for operators to allow the engine to reach normal operating temperatures before it is capable of producing full power, a process that may take from 20 to 30 minutes. However, the diesel generator can be immediately loaded to 100% power output, despite design criteria cautions, at the discretion of the submarine commander on the recommendation of the submarine's engineer, if necessity dictates such actions to: (a) restore electrical power to the submarine, (b) prevent a reactor incident from occurring or escalating, or (c) to protect the lives of the crew or others as determined necessary by the commanding officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DiMercurio |first=Michael |last2=Benson |first2=Michael |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Submarines |place=New York, NY |publisher=Alpha Books |year=2003 |pages=49–52 |isbn=978-0-02-864471-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, steam power is generated by the submarine's [[nuclear reactor]] delivering pressurized hot water to the steam generator, which generates steam to drive the [[Steam turbine|steam-driven turbines]] and [[Electrical generator|generators]]. While the emergency diesel generator is starting up, power can be provided from the submarine's battery through the ship service motor generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elger |first=Wallace |title=Development of Metal Fiber Electrical Brushes for 500kW SSMG Sets |journal=Naval Engineers Journal |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=37–38 |date=October 2005 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.2005.tb00382.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, propulsion is normally delivered through the submarine's steam-driven main turbines that drive the submarine's propeller through a reduction gear system. The submarine has no main drive shaft, unlike conventional diesel electric submarines.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Propulsion [https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/eng/reactor.html Pressurized water Naval nuclear propulsion system] at [[Federation of American Scientists]] Accessed on 30 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Periscope Depth.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Key West|SSN-722|6}} submerged at [[periscope depth]] off the coast of [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] in July 2004]]

===Propulsion===
The ship is equipped with a [[light water reactor]], model GE PWR S6G, generating {{convert|35,000|shp|kW|lk=in}}, developed and supplied by General Electric. The auxiliary prop motor by Magnatek supplies 242&amp;nbsp;kW. The life of the fuel cells is approximately ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;navaltech&quot;&gt;[http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/la/]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the improved 688 program included the improved Performance Machinery Program Phase I.

The S6G reactor plant was originally designed to use the D1G-2 core, similar to the D2G reactor used on the {{sclass-|Bainbridge|cruiser|0}} [[guided missile cruiser]], which is rated at 148 MW. All ''Los Angeles''-class submarines from {{USS|Providence|SSN-719}} on were built with a D2W core rated at 165 MW, as opposed to the 150 MW cores found on older boats. The D1G-2 cores are being replaced with D2W cores when the boats are refueled.
