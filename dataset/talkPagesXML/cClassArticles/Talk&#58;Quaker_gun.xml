== Comment ==
'''I like this gun.  Its cool how it scared off troops.  I'm going to do a prodject on it.'''

== Changes ==
I changed the illustration to one that better illustrates the concept, added text about their use at Centreville.  &quot;Fake&quot; seems less pretentious than &quot;simulated&quot;.

:Totally agree - but avoid the term &quot;fake&quot;; it sounds like you bought something bad....a more appropriate modern military term would be &quot;deception tactic&quot;...just a suggestion:)...[[User:Engr105th|Engr105th]] ([[User talk:Engr105th|talk]]) 07:31, 14 January 2008 (UTC)

::I agree with you both and have restructured the article so as to use the term &quot;deception tactic&quot;, rather than &quot;fake&quot;. [[User:Laurinavicius|Laurinavicius]] ([[User talk:Laurinavicius|talk]]) 00:32, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

== Shipboard use ==
The use of Quaker Guns on sailing ships was common. Both the guns themselves, and more frequently painted gun ports on merchant vessels were common deception tactics. Sorry, I don't have any references, and I am unsure whether this information belongs in this article or elsewhere. --[[User:Dthomsen8|DThomsen8]] ([[User talk:Dthomsen8|talk]]) 12:35, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
:In my opinion, this information definitely does belong in this article and should have its own section. However, I've never heard of Quaker Guns being used on merchant ships, although that seems quite logical to me. If we can find a couple of sources stating this, it'll be in the article. My regards, [[User:Laurinavicius|Laurinavicius]] ([[User talk:Laurinavicius|talk]]) 15:49, 13 September 2009 (UTC)

== Capitalisation ==
Shouldn't it be &quot;Quaker gun&quot; rather than &quot;Quaker Gun&quot;? Seems to me that only the [[Society of Friends|Quaker]] part of the name is a proper noun and the &quot;g&quot; should be lower case.--[[User:Ospalh|ospalh]] ([[User talk:Ospalh|talk]]) 18:42, 13 October 2009 (UTC)
:Nope, the entire name is a proper noun, so it should be capitalized. My regards, [[User:Laurinavicius|Laurinavicius]] ([[User talk:Laurinavicius|talk]]) 21:53, 13 October 2009 (UTC)

== Vietnam war ==
In the [[Wings_(Discovery_Channel_TV_series)]] episode on the F-105 Thunderchief, there was a mention of North Vietnam painting telephone poles white to act as decoy anti-aircraft missiles, used as a decoy to lure a massive American airstrike into range of around 3,000 anti-aircraft guns and a loss of 60% of the aircraft in the mission. In a classic case of &quot;Loose Lips Sink Ships&quot; President Johnson had spoken freely about the mission at least two weeks in advance and ordered the attack to go ahead over the objections of military advisers.

== quaker gun civil war citation information ==
I found siege of corinth citation information in the Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete
author U.S. Grant, chapter XXVI (available on project gutenberg): 
Corinth had already been evacuated and the National troops marched on and took possession without
opposition.  Everything had been destroyed or carried away.  The
Confederate commander had instructed his soldiers to cheer on the
arrival of every train to create the impression among the Yankees that
reinforcements were arriving.  There was not a sick or wounded man left
by the Confederates, nor stores of any kind. Some ammunition had been
blown up--not removed--but the trophies of war were a few Quaker guns,
logs of about the diameter of ordinary cannon, mounted on wheels of
wagons and pointed in the most threatening manner towards us.

I am new to wikipedia. I do not know how to make a citation so I am leaving this information here to try to help someone else to add the citation  in the article.
