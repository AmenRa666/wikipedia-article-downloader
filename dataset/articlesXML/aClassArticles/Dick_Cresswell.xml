'''Richard (Dick) Cresswell''', [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (27 July 1920&amp;nbsp;– 12&amp;nbsp;December 2006) was an officer and pilot in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He held command of [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 (Fighter) Squadron]] twice during World War&amp;nbsp;II, and again during the [[Korean War]]. In this capacity, he was credited with being the first RAAF pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft at night over Australian soil, the only man to serve as commanding officer of an RAAF squadron on three occasions during wartime, and the first officer to lead a jet-equipped Australian squadron in combat. His performance in Korea earned him both the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Commonwealth]] and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|US Distinguished Flying Crosses]].

Born in [[Tasmania]], Cresswell worked as an apprentice electrician before joining the RAAF in July 1938. He initially commanded No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron from April 1942 to August 1943, flying [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawks]] in defence of Australia's [[North Western Area Campaign|North-Western Area]] against Japanese raiders. Cresswell claimed the squadron's first aerial victory—the first by an Australian over the mainland—in November 1942. He was wing leader of [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 (Fighter) Wing]] in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] from May 1944 to March 1945, simultaneously commanding No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron for a second time between September and December 1944. In September 1950, during the Korean War, Cresswell took command of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron in combat for the third time. He oversaw its conversion from [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustangs]] to [[Gloster Meteor]]s, becoming the first RAAF commander of a jet squadron in war. As well as Meteors, Cresswell flew [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|F-80 Shooting Star]] and [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] jets in combat while on attachment to the [[United States Air Force]] in Korea. He handed over command of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron for the last time in August 1951, but flew six more missions as a Meteor pilot in 1953.

Cresswell was responsible for converting pilots to jet fighters as commanding officer of [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Operational Training Unit]] in Australia from 1953 until 1956. He resigned from the RAAF the following year, and flew with [[Bobby Gibbes]]' Sepik Airways in New Guinea before joining [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Australia]] in 1959. Initially engaged by the company as a pilot, he later became a salesman. Cresswell resigned from de&amp;nbsp;Havilland in 1974, but maintained his connection with military aviation, including No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron. He died in December 2006, aged eighty-six.

==Early life==
Richard Cresswell was born in [[Youngtown, Tasmania|Franklin]], near [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], Tasmania, on 27&amp;nbsp;July 1920.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=HighFliers&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp. 127–129&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name=DoubleSeven5&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only child of English immigrants George Cresswell, an engineer, and his wife Constance (née [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland]]).  His father died when Dick was three-and-a-half, and he later moved to [[Sydney]] with his mother. For three years he lived with another family in [[Balgowlah, New South Wales|Balgowlah]], and commenced his schooling at Manly West. He again lived with his mother in [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]] between 1931 and 1938, continuing his education at [[Double Bay, New South Wales|Double Bay]] and [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]].&lt;ref name=DoubleSeven5/&gt; After leaving Randwick High School in 1935, he began technical studies at [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]] as part of an electrical apprenticeship with [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Fired partly by his mother's stories of joy flights in [[World War I|pre-war]] Britain, and a desire to become a [[flying boat]] captain for [[Imperial Airways]], Cresswell applied to join the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in September 1937. Receiving no answer from the RAF, he applied for the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), and was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, as an air cadet in July 1938. Over the next twelve months he learnt to fly in [[Avro 643 Cadet|Avro Cadet]], [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Gipsy Moth]] and [[Westland Wapiti]] trainers, and graduated as a [[pilot officer]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; His first posting was to [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|Richmond]], New South Wales, where he began flying [[Hawker Demon]] fighters in July 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell recalled a mix of excitement and panic within the squadron when [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War&amp;nbsp;II broke out]] two months later: &quot;The second night we all slept on the hangar floor next to our aircraft. Imagine it: there was war over in Europe and here we were at action stations!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
After a brief posting to Point Cook in early 1940, Cresswell undertook the instructors' course at [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] in [[Camden Airport (New South Wales)|Camden]], New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He then became an instructor at [[No. 2 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Service Flying Training School]], which was formed at [[RAAF Base Wagga|Wagga Wagga]] in July and operated [[Avro Anson]]s and [[CAC Wirraway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, '' Training Units'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The school's commander, [[Frederick Scherger]], advised Cresswell to grow a moustache to overcome his youthful appearance. He was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] in January 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] by Japanese forces on 19&amp;nbsp;February 1942, Cresswell was posted to [[RAAF Base Williamtown|Williamtown]] as a liaison officer with the [[9th Attack Squadron|9th Squadron]] of the US 49th Pursuit Group (later the [[49th Operations Group|49th Fighter Group]]), which operated [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawks]] and would shortly transfer to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] to provide air defence for the [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnston136&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

The RAAF had meanwhile raised three fighter units—[[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;75]], [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76]] and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 Squadrons]]—equipped with Kittyhawks recently delivered from the United States.&lt;ref name=Stephens139&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell, newly promoted to [[squadron leader]], assumed command of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron at [[RAAF Base Pearce|Pearce]], Western Australia, on 20&amp;nbsp;April. At twenty-one, he was younger than most of his personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on his technical experience at Westinghouse, he encouraged his pilots to respect their aircraft and the ground crews that maintained them.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 16, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Initially responsible for the air defence of [[Perth]], No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron transferred to [[Batchelor Airfield]] near Darwin in August, becoming the first RAAF fighter unit to be stationed in the North-Western Area.&lt;ref name=Fighter54&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt; It moved to another of Darwin's satellite airfields, [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone]], in September.&lt;ref name=Eather/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070521--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 644]&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell led the squadron in the defence of Darwin against Japanese raiders and claimed its first aerial victory just after 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1942, when he destroyed a [[Mitsubishi G4M|Mitsubishi &quot;Betty&quot;]] bomber.&lt;ref name=Fighter54/&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnston251&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first &quot;kill&quot; for an Australian squadron over the mainland, and the first night victory over Australia. When he returned to base and was asked what he felt like, Cresswell replied, &quot;Breakfast&quot;.&lt;ref name=Johnston251/&gt; He souvenired the radio operator's seat from the bomber's wreckage.&lt;ref name=Relic&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article116341107 |title=Relic of Darwin air warfare |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Canberra |date=4 April 1975 |accessdate=20 September 2016 |page=7 |via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1943, after [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Fighter) Wing]] and its three [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons became operational in the Darwin area, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron was transferred to [[Milne Bay]] in New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070521--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 651]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 267, 291&lt;/ref&gt; It came under the control of the newly formed [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing]], which was part of [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Operational Group]], the RAAF's main mobile formation in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]].&lt;ref name=Odgers23&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070531--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 23–24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens144&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese attacked Milne Bay on 14&amp;nbsp;April, and Cresswell claimed one of four bombers (and a fighter) credited to No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron.&lt;ref name=Fighter55&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 285–287&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron began moving to [[Goodenough Island]], where it was controlled by [[No. 73 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;73 Wing]].&lt;ref name=Odgers33&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070531--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 33–36]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; As Japanese fighter opposition was limited, Cresswell led the squadron in several ground-attack missions over [[New Britain]].&lt;ref name=Odgers33/&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnston320&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; He was due to hand over command to his designated successor, Flight Lieutenant Daryl Sproule, on 2&amp;nbsp;August, but Sproule crash-landed during a raid the same day and was captured and executed by the Japanese.&lt;ref name=Johnston320/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070554--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 71]&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, Cresswell remained in command another three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28&amp;nbsp;August 1943, Cresswell was ordered to report to [[Port Pirie Airport|Port Pirie]], South Australia, for &quot;flying duties&quot;, but found instead that he was to be [[court-martial]]led for &quot;conduct to the prejudice of good order and Air Force discipline&quot;. The charge arose from an incident in July 1942, when Cresswell had stayed overnight at Port Pirie's [[mess]] and had fired his [[revolver]] into the floor next to the feet of another officer who apparently had been annoying him.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell was found guilty and lost three months' seniority. He considered resigning his commission but was placated by the Air Member for Personnel, Air Commodore [[Frank Lukis]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell was promoted to [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] in January 1944, backdated three months to eliminate the penalty of his court-martial.&lt;ref name=DoubleSeven47&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

After instructing at [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Operational Training Unit]] in [[Mildura Airport|Mildura]], Victoria, Cresswell was appointed wing leader of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Wing on 25&amp;nbsp;February 1944, at the specific request of its commander, Group Captain [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Peter Jeffery]], to help reduce Spitfire accident rates.&lt;ref name=DoubleSeven47/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Killer Caldwell'', p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The wing leader was responsible for tactical command of the formation in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ''Darwin Spitfires'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In March, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Wing hurriedly despatched two squadrons to [[Western Australia]] in response to fears that a Japanese naval force [[Western Australian emergency of March 1944|would raid the Perth area]]; no attack ensued, and the squadrons returned within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070557--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 136–139]&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was by now free of Japanese raids and Cresswell left on 12&amp;nbsp;May to become wing leader and temporary commander of [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 (Fighter) Wing]] in [[Townsville]], Queensland.&lt;ref name=DoubleSeven47/&gt; Comprising three Kittyhawk squadrons, including No.&amp;nbsp;77, the wing transferred to [[Noemfoor]] in western New Guinea as part of No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group (later [[Australian First Tactical Air Force|First Tactical Air Force]]), which had taken over No.&amp;nbsp;9 Group's mobile role and was supporting the US landings along the north coast of New Guinea.&lt;ref name=Stephens144/&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers249&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070730--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 249]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cresswell arrived at Noemfoor on 26&amp;nbsp;September 1944 to be informed by No. 81 Wing's new commander, Group Captain [[Gordon Steege]], that he did not need a wing leader. Instead, Steege assigned Cresswell to command No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, for the second time during the war. Cresswell questioned the decision through official channels, with the result that he retained the position of wing leader, as well as the command of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; The wing flew 1,125 sorties against Japanese buildings, stores and transport in October and November, dropping over {{convert|400000|lb|kg}} of bombs for the loss of fifteen aircraft and eleven pilots.&lt;ref name=Odgers386&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070397--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 386–390]&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Group Captain [[Wilfred Arthur]] replaced Steege as commander of No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing, and Cresswell handed over command of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, while continuing to serve as wing leader.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur recommended Cresswell for a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], but according to biographer [[George Odgers]] this was &quot;'lost' in the system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The relegation of First Tactical Air Force to areas of operation bypassed by the main Allied thrust towards the Philippines and Japan led to poor morale. Arthur produced a &quot;balance sheet&quot; to demonstrate that No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing's combat results were not worth the cost in ordnance and casualties, setting in train events that would culminate in the so-called &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot; the following April, when eight senior pilots, including Arthur and fellow [[Flying ace|aces]] [[Clive Caldwell]] and [[Bobby Gibbes]], protested by attempting to resign their commissions.&lt;ref name=Odgers386/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070400--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 443–450]&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell was by then in Australia on leave, having posted out from No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing in March. Though in complete accord with the aims of the &quot;mutineers&quot;, he believed that attempting to resign their commissions en masse was not an appropriate response.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Cresswell was on the twelve-week War Staff Course at the RAAF Staff School in [[Mount Martha, Victoria|Mount Martha]], Victoria, when hostilities ended in the Pacific; the course finished on 28&amp;nbsp;September 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''Strategy and Red Ink'', pp. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; He was then tasked with developing a [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] conversion course, to train pilots for service with No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing, comprising three Mustang squadrons, including No.&amp;nbsp;77, as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan.&lt;ref name=Odgers65&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; On 1&amp;nbsp;February 1946, the crew conversion unit, CCU (Fighter), was established at Williamtown.&lt;ref name=Units71&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bases169&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations'', pp. 169–171&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell served initially as the CCU's chief instructor, and then as commanding officer from 29&amp;nbsp;March 1947.&lt;ref name=Odgers65/&gt;&lt;ref name=Units71/&gt; At the same time, he took command of the Williamtown base, as well as [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 (Fighter) Wing]], which controlled two Mustang squadrons and several ancillary units.&lt;ref name=Bases169/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; He had married a war widow, Bettine Harrison-Owen (née Cotter), on 27&amp;nbsp;July 1946 at St John's Church in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], Victoria.&lt;ref name=Odgers65/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22333770 |title=RAAF padre officiates |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 July 1946 |accessdate=10 September 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCU (Fighter) disbanded on 7&amp;nbsp;July 1947,&lt;ref name=Units71/&gt; but Cresswell remained in command of Williamtown and No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing until March 1948.&lt;ref name=Bases169/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

After a posting to [[RAAF Base Amberley|Amberley]], Queensland, Cresswell served on the directing staff of the first two courses held at the newly formed [[RAAF Staff College]], Point Cook. The college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six-month course on 13&amp;nbsp;June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted to the rank of squadron leader, as the air force and its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following [[demobilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''Strategy and Red Ink'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; On 10&amp;nbsp;July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron]], a Citizen Air Force unit based at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|Laverton]] and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean War==
When the [[Korean War]] broke out on 25&amp;nbsp;June 1950, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron was the only remaining RAAF unit of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan.  Led by Wing Commander Lou Spence, the squadron was preparing to return to Australia when it was placed on standby for action over Korea; it began operations as part of the [[United Nations]] (UN) peacekeeping force a week later.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 210, 222–225&lt;/ref&gt; Spence was killed in action on 9&amp;nbsp;September, and Cresswell was despatched to replace him as commanding officer.&lt;ref name=Solo227&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Korean314&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', pp. 314–315&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell thus became the only officer to lead the same RAAF squadron on three occasions during wartime.  According to George Odgers, his prior command of the squadron in combat and long experience flying single-engined aircraft, including the Mustang, meant that &quot;it would have been very difficult to find a RAAF fighter pilot who could equal Squadron Leader Cresswell's qualifications&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Stephens, in the official history of the post-war Air Force, noted that Cresswell was considered &quot;a good organiser and a 'goer'&quot;.&lt;ref name=Solo227/&gt; In an unusual move, the RAAF did not raise him to wing commander; he became No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's longest-serving commanding officer of the Korean War, but also the only one ranked squadron leader.&lt;ref name=Hurst112&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers155&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; This had the effect of ranking him below the US squadron commanders with whom he had to cooperate and of leaving him without an [[Executive officer#Military|operations officer]] of squadron leader rank to whom he could delegate some of the day-to-day tasks of running his unit.&lt;ref name=Hurst112/&gt;&lt;ref name=Korean312&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence's loss was a heavy blow to the squadron, and Cresswell's first task was to restore morale. He &quot;led from the front&quot;, according to pilot Jim Flemming, undertaking four sorties on his first day of operations three days after arriving in Japan on 17&amp;nbsp;September 1950.&lt;ref name=Solo227/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron transferred from [[Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni|Iwakuni]] in Japan to [[Pohang]], South Korea, on 12&amp;nbsp;October, to support UN troops advancing northwards from the [[Pusan Perimeter]] following General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[Battle of Inchon|amphibious landing]] behind North Korean lines at [[Incheon|Inchon]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt; On 20&amp;nbsp;October, the squadron became a component of the RAAF's newly established [[No. 91 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;91 (Composite) Wing]], headquartered at Iwakuni, but was under the operational control of the US [[35th Fighter-Interceptor Group]].&lt;ref name=Solo228&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell believed that the Iwakuni-based wing headquarters was not always in tune with frontline requirements, and he often dealt directly with Lieutenant General [[Horace Robertson|Sir Horace Robertson]], BCOF commander and the theatre's senior Australian officer, and the RAAF's [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice Marshal Scherger.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 73, 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

China entered the war in October 1950, and No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron undertook its first [[sortie]]s against Chinese ground forces on 1&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref name=Solo229&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  It flew its first missions supporting the [[Australian Army]] four days later, when Cresswell led attacks on Chinese armour opposing the [[3rd&amp;nbsp;Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]], at [[Pakchon County|Pakchon]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd&amp;nbsp;Battalion's Major [[Ian Bruce Ferguson|Bruce Ferguson]] described No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's close support as &quot;the closest I have ever seen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; On 16&amp;nbsp;November, the Australians began moving forward with the 35th Group to Yonpo, near [[Hamhung]].&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; From Yonpo they flew missions against Chinese forces surrounding the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] at [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir|Chosin Reservoir]]; Cresswell personally commanded several night sorties, attacking Chinese positions with machine guns and rockets.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist advance resulted in the squadron being hurriedly withdrawn to [[Pusan]] in early December. Cresswell had made a point of briefing his squadron every night during the developing crisis to avoid any panic arising from unsubstantiated rumours; the commander of the US [[Fifth Air Force]], Lieutenant General [[Earle E. Partridge]], praised him for his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 102–104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Since November 1950, the Communists had been operating a Russian-designed swept-wing jet fighter, the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]], that outclassed all other fighters in the theatre except the new [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]].&lt;ref name=Stephens229&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt; The MiGs were often flown by seasoned [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Air Force]] pilots, whose deployment was unofficial, and denied at the time by the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 107, 140&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF tried to purchase Sabres to replace No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's Mustangs but deliveries could not begin until 1954, so in December the Australian government agreed to buy British [[Gloster Meteor]] straight-wing jet fighters.&lt;ref name=Stephens229/&gt; In January and February 1951, while awaiting delivery of the Meteors, Cresswell gained jet experience by converting to [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|F-80 Shooting Stars]] and flying ten combat missions on attachment to the USAF's [[8th Operations Group|8th Fighter Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 119–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; This convinced him that the Meteors would require [[radio compass]]es to navigate in bad weather, and with the support of the USAF he succeeded in having these fitted to the Australian aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron completed its last Mustang mission on 6&amp;nbsp;April 1951 and returned to Iwakuni the next day to begin converting to Meteors.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;  Since July 1950 it had been credited with destroying sixty armoured vehicles and guns, 600 other vehicles, and over 2,000 buildings. Sixteen Mustangs had been destroyed and thirteen pilots killed.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron's loss rate in Korea was higher than it had sustained in a similar period during World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; On 20&amp;nbsp;April, the Americans awarded Cresswell the [[Air Medal]] for &quot;meritorious service&quot; and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for &quot;superior flying ability and extraordinary achievement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068965/RCDIG1068965--719-.JPG|title=Recommendation: United States Air Medal|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068965/RCDIG1068965--717-.JPG|title=Recommendation: United States Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permission to wear the decorations was [[The London Gazette|gazetted]] on 22&amp;nbsp;June and 13&amp;nbsp;July, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=39265 |supp=yes||date=22 June 1951|startpage=3411 |endpage=3412 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=39285 |date=13 July 1951|startpage=3810  |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it had operated effectively as a ground-attack unit with its Mustangs, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's primary role in the RAAF was interception, and it was hoped that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties, particularly as the USAF had only two squadrons of Sabres in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell therefore arranged for the USAF to lend him a Sabre to act as a MiG-15 in combat training with the Meteors at Iwakuni; he determined that the Meteor's manoeuvrability and rate of climb allowed it to match the swept-wing jet below {{convert|25000|feet|m}}, so that the best air-to-air tactic would be to work in concert with USAF Sabres operating at high level while the Australians flew at lower altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt; On 20&amp;nbsp;July, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron began moving to [[Gimpo|Kimpo]], South Korea, where it was tasked by the USAF's [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Cresswell took the squadron on its first Meteor operation on 29&amp;nbsp;July, an offensive sweep in &quot;[[MiG Alley]]&quot; between the [[Yalu River|Yalu]] and [[Chongchon River]]s on North Korea's border with [[Manchuria]], making him the first officer to lead an RAAF jet squadron in combat.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 2, 133&lt;/ref&gt; After encountering ill-directed anti-aircraft fire over [[Pyongyang]], the Australians saw MiG-15s parked in an airfield on the Chinese side of the border—where UN forces were forbidden to attack—but, somewhat to Cresswell's annoyance, the Communists refused to take off and fight.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurst142&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; He led the squadron on further offensive sweeps with USAF Sabres, and missions escorting [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29&amp;nbsp;Superfortresses]], but had no contact with MiGs in the air before completing his term as commanding officer and handing over to Wing Commander Steege on 16&amp;nbsp;August 1951.&lt;ref name=Solo234&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurst143&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 143–145&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no longer commanding a squadron, Cresswell continued flying in Korea. He secured another attachment to the USAF and converted to the F-86 Sabre in early September 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; Between 22&amp;nbsp;September and 1&amp;nbsp;October, he flew ten combat missions in Sabres with the [[336th Fighter Squadron|336th Fighter Interceptor Squadron]], dogfighting with MiG-15s on several occasions and damaging one.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurst147&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell left for Australia shortly afterwards, having flown a total of 144 sorties during the war: 110 in Mustangs, fourteen in Meteors, and ten each in Shooting Stars and Sabres.&lt;ref name=Hurst147/&gt; He was recommended for the Commonwealth Distinguished Flying Cross for &quot;leadership of high order&quot; on 23&amp;nbsp;October 1951; the award was promulgated on 8&amp;nbsp;January 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068965/RCDIG1068965--718-.JPG|title=Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=39435 |date=8 January 1952|startpage=196  |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alan Stephens, &quot;many who were familiar with his performance thought the higher [[Distinguished Service Order]] would have been more appropriate. There were suggestions that his occasional flamboyance, confidence and impressive combat experience were resented by more pedestrian senior RAAF officers&quot;.&lt;ref name=Solo234/&gt;

Upon returning to Australia, Cresswell was promoted to wing commander and appointed Fighter Staff Member at the RAAF Directorate of Operations.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1952 he was &quot;dared&quot; to fly from the [[Royal Australian Navy]] aircraft carrier [[HMAS Sydney (R17)|HMAS ''Sydney'']], and did so in a [[Hawker Sea Fury]] after completing conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as RAAF Fighter Staff Member, Cresswell returned to Korea in March–April 1953, flying six Meteor sorties with No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, and reporting deficiencies in instrument flying and air combat technique among the pilots.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] ended the Korean War on 27&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Korea==

Post-war demobilisation had seen the disbandment of all the RAAF's operational training units, and conversion of new pilots to combat aircraft became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice disrupted the squadrons' normal duties, and the advent of the Korean War and the introduction of jets exacerbated shortfalls in operational training.&lt;ref name=Stephens167&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 167–168, 364&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell later recalled that as commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron in Korea he had to send several replacement pilots back to Australia: &quot;I don't blame the pilots, but I do blame the Air Force system. We had no operational training units, no operational training system and, as a result, the pilots came to Korea poorly trained and without instrument ratings. They just couldn't operate in the area.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The RAAF re-formed No.&amp;nbsp;2 Operational Training Unit (No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU) in March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations.&lt;ref name=Stephens167/&gt; Headquartered at Williamtown, No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU was initially equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Vampire]] jets.&lt;ref name=Units62&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell assumed command on 21&amp;nbsp;May 1953.&lt;ref name=Units62/&gt; He established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight in November, to prepare for the introduction into service of Australian-built [[CAC Sabre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens348&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 348–349&lt;/ref&gt; As well as performance testing, the [[flight (military unit)|flight]] was responsible for teaching air-to-air combat techniques, to fill a capability void caused by the departure of many veteran fighter pilots of World War&amp;nbsp;II, and the RAAF's operational focus on ground attack rather than air combat in Korea.&lt;ref name=Stephens348/&gt; To facilitate the training, Cresswell and another pilot developed the RAAF's fighter combat instructor course, which has continued to be administered at Williamtown by No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU's successor formation, [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Operational Conversion Unit]].&lt;ref name=Stephens348/&gt;&lt;ref name=AirForce&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Liebert|first=Simone|title=Farewell to a 'great'|magazine=[[Air Force (newspaper)|Air Force]]|volume=49|issue=1|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130731033321/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4901/features/feature03.htm|date=8 February 2007|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3&amp;nbsp;December 1954, Cresswell led a formation of twelve No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron upon its return from Korea aboard the aircraft carrier [[HMS Vengeance (R71)|HMAS ''Vengeance'']].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; His successor as commanding officer of the conversion unit took over on 27&amp;nbsp;March 1956.&lt;ref name=Units62/&gt; Cresswell was posted to RAAF Headquarters, [[Melbourne]], as Director of Air Staff Policy. The position put him in line for promotion to [[group captain]] but, as he admitted later, &quot;I had itchy feet and I felt the Service had already given me all the operational flying I was likely to get.&quot;&lt;ref name=DoubleSeven160&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to resign his commission in December 1956, and was discharged from the RAAF on 30&amp;nbsp;April 1957.&lt;ref name=DoubleSeven160/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1078399|title=Cresswell, Richard|work=World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
On 13&amp;nbsp;June 1957, Cresswell became regional manager of a Melbourne firm salvaging metal from the battlefields of New Guinea, but the company wound up its operations in Australasia barely a month later. Bobby Gibbes then offered him the position of chief pilot with his New Guinea-based [[Sepik Airways]].  Cresswell flew [[Noorduyn Norseman]] and [[Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;52]] aircraft out of [[Goroka]] until October 1958, when he was hospitalised with [[hepatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 160–163&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to rejoin the RAAF the following year but was found to be suffering from [[malaria]] and [[dengue fever]], as well as the after-effects of hepatitis.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; On 6&amp;nbsp;October 1959, he joined [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Australia]] to fly [[De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver|DHC-2 Beavers]] in [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell's first marriage had failed after his return from the Korean War in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;  He married Margaret Schwennesen, a pilot, on 23&amp;nbsp;December 1959 at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne; the couple had two daughters.&lt;ref name=DoubleSeven164&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;

Cresswell began flying in Antarctica on 14&amp;nbsp;January 1960, mapping sections of the continent claimed by Australia. The task was cut short on 3&amp;nbsp;February, when the [[Antarctic Flight RAAF|RAAF Antarctic Flight]] pressed his Beaver into service after three of its aircraft were lost in a blizzard at [[Mawson Station|Mawson]].
