The '''Anglo–Spanish War''' was a war fought by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] against the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] from 1625 to 1630. The conflict formed part of the [[Eighty Years' War]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]].

==Background==
In 1620, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] reigned in Spain, with [[Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares]] as his favourite. The [[Eighty Years' War|War of Flanders]] had reignited after the [[Twelve-Year Truce]], and Spain's finances flowed from its imports of silver from its American colonies. [[James VI and I|James I]] was King of England, Scotland and Ireland, with his son [[Charles I of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]], as his heir. At this time the [[Kingdom of England]] had military ties with the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], which they had assisted in the War of Flanders.

Around this time a series of events unfolded resulting in the resumption of hostilities between the two kingdoms. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] which broke out in Europe, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V of the Palatinate]] and his wife [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]], the daughter of the King of England, were defeated and dispossessed by the [[Tercio|Spanish Tercios]].

[[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], accompanied the Prince of Wales on a trip to [[Madrid]] to arrange the details of the proposed wedding between Charles and [[Maria Anna of Spain]], however these negotiations proved unsuccessful.

In March 1624, James I, previously a pacifist, declared war on Spain with the support of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]; the House of Commons appropriated funding for the prosecution of the war. The next year James I died following a bout of [[dysentery]]. His successor, Charles I, pushed forward the preparations for war against Spain, even before he was crowned as king, with the assistance of the Duke of Buckingham.

==Siege of Breda==
In August 1624, Spanish General [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Don Ambrosio Spinola]] ordered the Dutch city of [[Breda]] besieged by his forces. The city of [[Breda]] was heavily fortified and defended by a garrison of 7,000 Dutch soldiers. Spinola rapidly gathered his defences and drove off a Dutch relief army under [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange]], who was attempting to cut off his supplies. In February 1625, another relief force, consisting of 7,000 English soldiers under Sir [[Horace Vere]] and [[Ernst von Mansfeld]], was also defeated.

Finally, [[Justin of Nassau]] surrendered [[Breda]] to the Spaniards in June 1625 after an [[Siege of Breda (1624)|eleven-month siege]].

==Cádiz Expedition==
[[File:GeorgeVilliers.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]
By October 1625, approximately 100 ships and a total of 15,000 seamen and soldiers were readied for the [[Cádiz Expedition (1625)|Cádiz Expedition]]. An alliance with the Dutch had also been forged, and the new allies agreed to dispatch an additional 15 warships commanded by William of Nassau, to assist in guarding the [[English Channel]] in the absence of the English main fleet. [[Edward Cecil|Sir Edward Cecil]], a battle-hardened veteran of combat in service with the Dutch, was appointed commander of the expedition by the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a choice that proved to be ill-considered. Cecil was a good soldier, but he had little knowledge of nautical matters.

[[File:Count-Duke of Olivares.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares]] by [[Diego Velázquez]]]]
The planned expedition involved several elements: overtaking Spanish treasure ships returning from the Americas loaded with valuables; and assaulting Spanish towns, with the intention of assailing the Spanish economy by weakening the Spanish supply chain and consequently relieving the military pressure on the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]].

The entire expedition descended into farce. The English forces wasted time in capturing an old  fort of little importance, giving Cádiz the time to fully mobilise behind its defences and allowing merchant ships in the bay to make good their escape. The city's modernised defences, a vast improvement on those of Tudor times, proved effective. Meanwhile, a body of English forces landed further down the coast to march on the city also became side-tracked because of poor discipline. Eventually, [[Edward Cecil|Sir Edward Cecil]], the commander of the English forces, faced with dwindling supplies, decided there was no alternative but to return to England, having captured few goods and having had no impact on Spain. And thus in December, a battered fleet returned home.

[[Charles I of England]], to protect his own dignity and Buckingham, who had failed to ensure the invasion fleet was well supplied, made no effort to inquire as to the cause of the failure of the [[Cádiz Expedition (1625)|Cadiz Expedition]]. Charles turned a blind eye to the debacle, instead preoccupying himself with the plight of the French Huguenots of La Rochelle. But the House of Commons proved less forgiving. The parliament of 1626 initiated the process of impeachment against the Duke of Buckingham, prompting Charles I to choose to dissolve parliament rather than risk a successful impeachment.

The failure of the attack had severe consequences for England. In addition to the economic and human loss, it damaged the reputation of the [[English Crown]], creating a serious political and financial crisis in the country.

==1627–1628==
The Duke of Buckingham then negotiated with the French regent, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], for English ships to aid Richelieu in his fight against the French [[Huguenot]]s, in exchange for French aid against the Spanish occupying the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], but the [[Parliament of England]] was disgusted and horrified at the thought of English Protestants fighting French Protestants. The plan only fuelled their fears of crypto-[[Catholicism]] at court. Buckingham himself, believing that the failure of his enterprise was the result of treachery by Richelieu, formulated an alliance among Cardinal Richelieu's many enemies, a policy that included support for the very Huguenots whom he had recently attacked.

The English force commanded by the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was defeated by the French Royal troops at the [[Siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré (1627)|Siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré]] and at the [[Siege of La Rochelle]]. In this campaign the English lost more than 4,000 men of a force of 7,000 men. On August 23, while organising a second campaign in [[Portsmouth]], England in 1628, Buckingham was stabbed to death at the [[Greyhound Pub]] by [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]], an army officer who had been wounded at the Siege of La Rochelle.

==St. Kitts and Nevis==
[[File:Charles I by Daniel Mytens.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Charles I of England]]]]
In 1629, a Spanish [[Battle of St. Kitts (1629)|naval expedition]], commanded by Admiral [[Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo y Mendoza|Don Fadrique de Toledo]], was sent to deal with the recently established Anglo-French colonies on the Caribbean islands of [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]. The territories were regarded by the Spanish Empire as its own since the islands were discovered by the Spanish in 1498 and the English and French colonies had grown sufficiently to be considered a threat to the [[Spanish West Indies]]. In the [[Battle of St. Kitts (1629)|Battle of St. Kitts]], the heavily armed settlements on both islands were destroyed and the Spanish seized the islands.

==Aftermath==
Following these defeats, England altered its involvement in the [[Thirty Years War]] by negotiating a peace treaty with France in 1629. Thereafter expeditions were undertaken by the [[Duke of Hamilton]] and Lord Craven to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in support of the thousands of Scottish mercenaries already serving under the [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|King of Sweden]] in that conflict. Hamilton's levy was raised despite the end of the Anglo-Spanish War.

In 1630, [[Philip IV of Spain]] and [[Charles I of England]] signed the [[Treaty of Madrid (1630)|Treaty of Madrid]], ending the war. It had proven a costly fiasco for England and Scotland, but merely a minor distraction for the Spanish and French, who were occupied by the wars engulfing Europe. In England, the war costs and mismanagement fueled the fire of disputes between the Monarchy and Parliament that began before the [[English Civil War]].
