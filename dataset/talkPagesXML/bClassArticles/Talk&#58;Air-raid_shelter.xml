Have apologised to David Levinson, he was not involved int the changes of 19Feb.
I have a feeling the pages may be corrupted, well, it's either that or I have gone barmy, but certain things about don't seem my style. I am asking a developer to take a look at it, the article that is, not me. ;-)  --[[User:Dieter Simon|Dieter Simon]] 23:16, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)

==Umlauts in ''hoch'' as in ''hochbunker''==
The German adjective ''hoch'' in the positive form never has an umlaut. It is only when it changes to the comparative ''h&amp;ouml;her'' or the superlative ''h&amp;ouml;chst'' that it receives the umlaut. [[User:Dieter Simon|Dieter Simon]] 00:58, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

==Who designed the Anderson Shelter?==
Many seemingly reputable websites and Encarta say the shelter was named after its designer, Dr David A. Anderson

::Although Dr David Anderson, one of the engineers from the Institute of Civil Engineers,  was involved in the evaluation of the design it was named after Sir John Anderson, the [[Lord Privy Seal]] at the time, who initiated the development of the shelter. [[User:Dieter Simon|Dieter Simon]] 22:21, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)
::The problem I find is that almost all of the sources citing him as the person after whom the shelter is named, call him the designer of the shelter. In fact, it was William Patterson and Oscar Karl Kerrison who were the designers. David A was really one of the civil engineering evaluation team, not a very likely eponym of the product. [[User:Dieter Simon|Dieter Simon]]
::The BBC website and the Museum of London website both quote Sir John Anderson. [[User:Dieter Simon|Dieter Simon]]

John Baker (designer of the Morrison shelter) in his book Enterprise versus Bureaucracy is very clear that the sectional shelter popularly know as the Anderson Shelter is named after Sir John Anderson, not David Anderson. He identifies David Anderson as 'doyen of British civil engineers, senior partner in the civil engineering consulting firm Mott, Hay and Anderson', and as one of the authors of Command Paper 5932 'Report on Air Raid Shelter Policy' December 1938.[[User:Alc59|Alc59]] ([[User talk:Alc59|talk]]) 16:40, 9 March 2011 (UTC)

== Interesting picture ==

Here's an interesting picture of a &quot;bomb shelter&quot; (as captioned) I found while browsing through the Library of Congress OWI archive: [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/fsa.8e00929]. It's essentially a ditch. Thought it might be good for this article, but there doesn't seem to be anything about ditches used for shelters in here. Maybe someone more familiar with the topic can use it better. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana; &quot;&gt;'''[[User:Howcheng|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#33C;&quot;&gt;howcheng&lt;/span&gt;]]'''  &lt;small&gt;{[[User talk:Howcheng|chat]]}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 20:39, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

:Good point. The 'ditch' as you call it, is better known  as a 'slit trench' and were very common.  See: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/38/a3631538.shtml] --[[User:Aspro|Aspro]] 17:45, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

== Merger of &quot;Fallout shelter&quot; with &quot;Air raid shelter&quot; ==

If any merger is to be done at all it should be &quot;fallout shelter&quot; into &quot;air raid shelter&quot;, and not the other way round. Fallout shelters are later a development of shelter after the creation of the atomic bomb, etc. My opinion is that they are totally different concepts, and therefore should not be merged at all. Fallout shelters are much more complicated in their conception, technology and the circumstances under which they were built. By all means, link the two articles but basically they are not really the same thing at all.&lt;br&gt; 

As regards to &quot;Blast shelter&quot;, again all the original air raid shelters were created under entirely different circumstances, they came in assembly kits, or were built according to the sudden dire needs of an actual ongoing war, were the development of pre-existing structures such as cellars, basements, underground stations, etc. rather than according to pre-conceived ideas of a war that might or might not happen such as a nuclear war. It's almost like merging &quot;cavalry&quot; with &quot;tanks&quot;. [[User:Dieter Simon|Dieter Simon]] 01:24, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:'''Do not merge'''. These are different classes of shelter and are better off as separate articles. All the different shelters are only a click away anyway.--[[User:Aspro|Aspro]] 17:45, 7 October 2007 (UTC)
::'''Do not merge'''. They are different types of shelters, and both articles stand on their own. [[User:AndyBQ|AndyBQ]] ([[User talk:AndyBQ|talk]]) 22:02, 7 February 2008 (UTC)
::'''Do not merge'''.  [[User:Spot87|Spot87]] ([[User talk:Spot87|talk]]) 23:08, 7 February 2008 (UTC)

::'''Do not Merge'''. Even though they are somewhat alike they are two different types of shelters, as by the difference in names suggests. Fallout shelters protect from nuclear fallout as air-raid shelters protect from aerial attacks. If some distinctions that are in the article which there are major similarities then see [[WP:POV]] [[User:Letter 7|Letter 7/Caleb]] ([[User talk:Letter 7|talk]]) 23:20, 7 May 2008 (UTC)

== Problem with this article ==

I seem to have lost the last sections of this article &quot;air-raid shelter&quot; while trying to correctly enter the sources of the various sections. I am trying to get some help to fix this [[User:Dieter Simon|Dieter Simon]] ([[User talk:Dieter Simon|talk]]) 01:10, 9 April 2008 (UTC)
:I fixed it, it was a missing &gt; on a closing ref tag. [[User:DuncanHill|DuncanHill]] ([[User talk:DuncanHill|talk]]) 22:52, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

== Protection notice ==

Air-raid shelter article protected [edit=autoconfirmed] (expires 22:49, 23 October 2009 (UTC)) [move=autoconfirmed] (expires 22:49, 23 October 2009 (UTC)) (Excessive vandalism)&gt; [[User:Dieter Simon|Dieter Simon]] ([[User talk:Dieter Simon|talk]]) 22:57, 9 October 2009 (UTC)

== London Underground ==

I have made substantial amendments to this section, based on current researches for a new book.  Some background can be read in Angus Calder's &quot;The People's War&quot;, which makes it clear that the shelter policy was extremely contentious. A review of the contemporary Hansard, War Cabinet Conclusions, and newspaper cuttings throughout the period showed that the situation was extremely tense. War Cabinet minutes record Winston Churchill wanting to take &quot;strong action&quot; against campaigners who were demonstrating for better protection.

I do not have a current user account, and having had earlier work savaged, I am not inclined to open up one, so these additions will have to remain anonymous. The do, however, represent the best (short) account or what was going on then.  If the account remains, substantially unchanged, I may add to it in the future.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.12.71.146|92.12.71.146]] ([[User talk:92.12.71.146|talk]]) 13:23, 7 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::This seems rather a shame. In my experience it is much more likely to have an edit vandalised or removed if added by anonymous contributors. As long as you include the necessary source citations you should be OK. Surely you can create a nick for the sake of your valuable edits. Many thanks for them. [[User:Dieter Simon|Dieter Simon]] ([[User talk:Dieter Simon|talk]]) 01:53, 8 March 2011 (UTC)


== Expansion Needed ==

There needs to be more information on other shelters worldwide instead of just those in Britain. There is a photo of one in Israel but additions of other shelters constructed like in the United States, Germany, Japan, France, etc are needed. While fallout shelters are not &quot;directly&quot; known as air-raid shelters there should be some differentiation at the beginning of the article denoting Air-raid, blast and fallout shelters and links to those articles.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.23.130.121|98.23.130.121]] ([[User talk:98.23.130.121|talk]]) 03:01, 27 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Very large UK WWII section ==

At the moment this article is very unbalanced and dominated by the UK section. I suggest that the UK sections are moved out into a new UK WWII specific article and the contents are summarised in this article. If this were done then other sections could be expanded until such time as they need to be moved out to specific articles and the and summarised here.

Anyone have a good idea for a name for a UK article (it would probably need a mention of UK World War I and cold war shelters, so how about [[Air-raid shelter (United Kingdom)]]?
