The Pakistani public reacted with protests all over the country and the government took measures adversely affecting the US exit strategy from Afghanistan including the evacuation of [[Shamsi Airfield]] and closure of the [[NATO supply lines to Afghanistan|NATO supply line]].

On 3 July 2012, US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] officially, however briefly, apologized for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military. Subsequently, Pakistan restored the NATO supply routes.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN20120704&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=CNN Wire Staff|title=Pakistan reopens NATO supply routes to Afghanistan|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/03/world/asia/us-pakistan-border-routes/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|work=CNN Wirestaff|publisher=CNN|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and timeline==
{{main|War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|War in North-West Pakistan}}

===The incident===
On 26 November 2011, US-led NATO forces opened fire on two Pakistani border check-posts stationed near the [[Durand Line|Pakistan-Afghanistan border]]. The attack occurred at approximately 02:00 [[Pakistan Standard Time|local time]] (01:30 in Afghanistan and 21:00 [[GMT]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;timeofattack&quot;/&gt; According to the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), [[Major General]] [[Ashfaq Nadeem]], the attack was a coordinated NATO strike and used two [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|AH-64D Apache Longbow]] helicopters, an [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130H Spectre gunship]] and two [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15E Eagle]] fighter jets. A [[Beechcraft C-12 Huron|MC-12W Liberty]] turbo-propeller aircraft was used in an [[ISTAR|Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance]] role.&lt;ref name=&quot;AC-130 and Apache used&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ClarkReport&gt;{{cite web|title=US Central Command Investigation into Salala Checkpoint Engagement|url=http://www.scribd.com/full/80616338?access_key=key-26rt0xtpw7icq41c5zat|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The check-posts were located {{convert|200|m}} to {{convert|2.5|km}} inside Pakistan from the border with Afghanistan in the Salala area of the Baizai subdivision of the Mohmand tribal region in FATA, Pakistan. The two check-posts were separated themselves by a distance of one kilometre on the Salala mountain top.&lt;ref name=&quot;200 meters&quot;/&gt;

The attacks caused the deaths of up to twenty-four Pakistani soldiers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-01&quot; /&gt; which included two officers – Major Mujahid Mirani and [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] Usman Ali. Thirteen other soldiers were injured as a result of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Both sides reported they were attacked first. The poorly defined border, as well as a history of [[Taliban insurgency|Taliban fighters]] moving around the Afghan border regions, were cited as possible contributing factors to the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-01&quot;/&gt;

[[File:AC-130H Spectre (2152981898).jpg|thumb|An AC-130 gunship (pictured) was used in addition to two Apache helicopters and two F-15E Eagle fighter jets to carry out the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;AC-130 and Apache used&quot; /&gt;]]

====US-Afghan claims====
According to Afghan and US officials, the incident started after US-Afghan coalition forces, which were conducting an operation against the Afghan Taliban in Afghanistan's eastern [[Kunar Province]], were fired upon from border positions within Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCNews-01&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJReport/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJReport/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/nato-came-under-fire-pakistan-attack-sources-134017538.html NATO came under fire from Pakistan before attack: sources] {{wayback|url=http://news.yahoo.com/nato-came-under-fire-pakistan-attack-sources-134017538.html |date=20111223144508 |df=y }}, Reuters, 27 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newser&quot;/&gt; &quot;There was firing coming from the position against Afghan army soldiers who requested support&quot;, said one Afghan official in Kabul.&lt;ref name=WSJReport/&gt; The Afghan official further stated they were being fired upon directly from a Pakistani military outpost itself.&lt;ref name=TWR&gt;{{cite web|last=Shrivastava|first=Sanskar;|title=US, NATO Attack on Pakistan Affected South Asia's Geopolitics Over a Week|url=http://www.theworldreporter.com/2011/11/us-nato-attack-on-pakistan-affected.html|work=The World Reporter|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Western official backed up that view by stating, &quot;They were fired on from a Pakistani army base.&quot; And, &quot;It was a defensive action.&quot;&lt;ref name=WSJReport/&gt; According to Afghan and US accounts helicopters were then called in for support against the incoming fire.&lt;ref name=WSJReport&gt;{{cite news|last=Nissenbaum|first=Dion; Tom Wright; Adam Entous|title=Airstrike Ravages U.S.-Pakistan Ties|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204630904577061270317324992.html|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=28 November 2011|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/afghan-soldiers-called-deadly-nato-airstrike-143342422.html Afghan soldiers called in deadly NATO airstrike], AP, RAHIM FAIEZ and RIAZ KHAN, 27 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tough-line&gt;{{cite web|last=Flaherty |first=Anne |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/nov/27/2-key-senators-call-tough-line-pakistan/ |title=2 key senators call for tough line with Pakistan |work=Washington Times |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Pakistani defence official reportedly admitted that soldiers in the Pakistani border post sitting there for the express purpose of stopping infiltration fired a few flares, a couple of mortar rounds and one or two bursts of machine-gun fire in that direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karen DeYoung&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Afghans say commando unit was attacked before airstrike was called on Pakistan|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/afghans-say-unit-was-attacked-before-airstrike/2011/11/28/gIQAX6ZY5N_story.html?hpid=z1|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|author=Karen DeYoung|author2=Joshua Partlow|date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another US official in Kabul pointed to [[Pakistan–United States skirmishes#Kurram incident|an incident in September 2010]], when a NATO helicopter fired on a Pakistan outpost, killing two soldiers. &quot;It was a situation where insurgent forces butted right up against a Pakistani border post and used that as a firing position. When we fired back, we hit Pakistani security forces. Military officials in Kabul claimed insurgents in Pakistan have also used empty Pakistan border bases to stage attacks, which they say may have been the working assumption of the coalition forces who called in the airstrike when they drew fire.&lt;ref name=WSJReport/&gt;

One US official said NATO forces had informed the Pakistani army's 11th Corps command near the western border that operations against Taliban insurgents would take place on that day. Pakistani General Abbas admitted in a press conference that coalition forces had &quot;informed our military earlier, much earlier, that they will be conducting an operation there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karen DeYoung&quot;/&gt;

According to the US military, information about the proposed strike was passed on at one of the centres on the border where both sides station officers and exchange information in an effort to avoid firing on each other, after which Pakistani officers cleared the strike, saying that there were no Pakistani forces in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Julian E. and Adam Entous, &quot;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203833104577072771910500442.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Pakistan Was Consulted Before Fatal Hit, U.S. Says]&quot;, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Roggio|Roggio, Bill]], &quot;[http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2011/12/pakistan_cleared_isaf_airstrik.php Pakistan cleared ISAF airstrikes that killed its own troops], ''[[Long War Journal]]'', 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident sparked outrage and controversy in Pakistan, which termed the attack an &quot;unprovoked and indiscriminate firing,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan blasts &quot;unprovoked&quot; NATO attacks|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-57331477-503543/pakistan-blasts-unprovoked-nato-attacks/|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; an &quot;irresponsible act,&quot; and a &quot;stark violation&quot; of its sovereignty.&lt;ref name=&quot;kyodo&quot;/&gt; Leaders of the Pakistani military establishment viewed NATO's attacks on the army checkposts as intentional, pre-planned and premeditated.&lt;ref name=&quot;preplanned&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/28-Dec-2011/pakistan-rejects-us-army-findings-on-nato-attacks|title=Pakistan rejects US army findings on Nato attacks|work=The Nation|date=28 December 2011|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slamming NATO's version of events as &quot;lame excuses&quot;, Pakistan rejected claims of any firing having emanated from its side as a prelude to the encounter, saying that the soldiers who were manning the post were asleep and resting when NATO launched the assault at night.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCNews-01&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=5 Minutes 10 Minutes &lt;!-- // .tier-2 --&gt; |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/pakistan-hits-lame-excuses-for-nato-attack/story-e6frg6so-1226208563639 |title=Pakistan hits 'lame excuses' for NATO attack |work=The Australian  |accessdate=29 November 2011 |date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director general of the [[Inter Services Public Relations|ISPR]], [[Major General]] [[Athar Abbas]] challenged NATO to &quot;present proof if they claim that firing was started from Pakistani side.

Pakistani authorities tried to contact their NATO counterparts in an effort to inform them of the situation but the Pakistani request reportedly failed to reach the attacking force.

In a media conference with the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Major General Ashfaq, Chief of General Staff [[Lieutenant General]] [[Waheed Arshad]], claimed that this was not an &quot;unintended&quot; incident. On accounts of series of events he commented that NATO was informed at the time of attack but their helicopters remained on course of aggression. Pakistani military also said that the NATO forces returned a second time to attack the post again.&lt;ref name=TWR/&gt; When he was asked whether Pakistan was satisfied with the investigating team headed under US Air force [[Brigadier General]] Stephon, he responded sharply by commenting that all incidents in past in relation to violation of Pakistan's sovereignty did not come to an agreeable conclusion.

The Pakistani military called the strike &quot;unprovoked and indiscriminate.&quot; Government of Pakistan launched a strong protest with U.S and also immediately discontinued the supply to NATO troops located in Afghanistan. Notably, the strike on Saturday came one day after Gen. John Allen, the commander of the US-led coalition in Afghanistan, visited Pakistani army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. In that meeting, both the commanders discussed border co-ordination and other measures &quot;aimed at enhancing border control on both sides.&quot; NATO attack shows that either Gen. John Allen lacks control over his troops based in Afghanistan or did negotiations while putting on the mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2011/11/26/nato-attacked-pak-check-post-bonn-conference-0 |title=NATO Attacked Pak Check Post &amp; Bonn Conference |first=Zaheerul |last=Hassan |work=[[Asian Tribune]] |date=27 November 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US policy makers tried to find alternative routes through Russia, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Tajikistan]] (termed as the &quot;Northern Distribution Network&quot;) but these are longer and less effective than routes through Pakistan. Huge costs are associated with the Central Asian supply lines, and NATO's supply line through Russia is already under a looming danger of closure due to friction over missile defence plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainability of Nato supply line&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Abdul Zahoor Khan Marwat|title=Sustainability of Nato supply line|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=81604&amp;Cat=2|newspaper=The News|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a landlocked country, Afghanistan is highly dependent on Pakistan for its imports. According to figures released by [[The Pentagon]] in January 2012, the United States was paying six times more to send supplies to troops in Afghanistan via alternative supply routes following the closure of Pakistani routes. The figures placed the new US costs at $104 million per month, roughly $87 million costlier per month than when the cargo was transported via Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10049831|title=APNewsBreak: Costs soar for new war supply routes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=24 February 2012|author=Robert Burns|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high costs were associated with the routes being lengthier.&lt;ref name=&quot;other routes&quot;/&gt;

In late March 2012, a US military official stated that the United States would have to use routes through the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) for supplies to Afghanistan if Pakistan refused to reopen its supply lines. However, he conceded the expensiveness of these routes and noted that negotiations with Pakistan regarding the possibility of opening of the supply routes were ongoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;other routes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/357443/us-to-rely-on-india-in-case-pakistan-doesnt-resume-nato-routes/|title='US to rely on India in case Pakistan doesn't resume NATO routes'|work=Express Tribune|last=Imtiaz|first=Huma|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing United States-Pakistan relations and outlining what was needed to repair bilateral relations, the Pakistani parliament turned the decision of reopening the NATO supply lines over to the government in April 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSM 20120416&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Latif|first=Aamir|title=Pakistan moves to reopen NATO supply lines, but US ties remain frayed|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2012/0416/Pakistan-moves-to-reopen-NATO-supply-lines-but-US-ties-remain-frayed|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to an [[Pakistani general election, 2013|upcoming general election]] in Pakistan, with widespread anti-American sentiments in the country, the Pakistani government was reluctant to reopen the lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Talks with US on ties next week|url=http://dawn.com/2012/04/22/talks-with-us-on-ties-next-week/|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=Dawn|date=22 April 2012|author=Anwar Iqbal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and postponed its decision until the United States responded positively to Pakistani demands outlined in the parliamentary recommendations,&lt;ref name=&quot;CSM 20120416&quot; /&gt; such as a US apology for the November 2011 incident, the bringing of those involved in the strike to justice, and a stop to US drone airstrikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan postpones reopening of NATO supply line|url=http://www.irna.ir/News/Politic/Pakistan-postpones-reopening-of-NATO-supply-line/80085125|work=Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)|publisher=Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talks between Pakistan and the United States failed in April 2012 after Pakistan could not get an unconditional apology from the United States for the November 2011 incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT20120424&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=United States Talks Fail as Pakistanis Seek Apology|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/28/world/asia/talks-between-us-and-pakistan-fail-over-airstrike-apology.html?hp|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 April 2012|author=Declan Walsh, Eric Schmitt and Steven Lee Myers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White House]] refused to apologise after [[April 2012 Afghanistan attacks|Taliban attacks in Kabul and other cities]] in Afghanistan on 15 April 2012, which according to US military and intelligence officials came from the [[Haqqani network]], an Afghan group working from a base in [[North Waziristan]] along the Afghanistan border in Pakistan's tribal belt.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT20120424&quot; /&gt; Pakistani officials said they cannot open the NATO supply routes in Afghanistan without a US apology.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT20120424&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. drone strikes resume in Pakistan; action may complicate vital negotiations|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/us-drone-strikes-resume-in-pakistan-action-may-complicate-vital-negotiations/2012/04/29/gIQAIprqpT_story.html?tid=pm_world_pop|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=29 April 2012|author=Richard Leiby and Karen DeYoung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unnamed US officials said that US officials said they had hoped a meeting between Pakistani President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] and US President Barack Obama as well as sharing the spotlight with President Obama and other global leaders during the [[2012 Chicago Summit|2012 NATO Chicago Summit]] might provide an incentive for a deal on resuming supply shipments. &quot;The invitation was an inducement to get them back into the international fold,&quot; said a senior US official, speaking anonymously because of the sensitive issues. &quot;But the Pakistanis couldn't get their own act together&quot; in time for the summit. &quot;The main issue, it seems, is money.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NATO summit: Obama's Pakistan gamble falls flat|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-nato-afghanistan-20120522,0,3468909,full.story|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=21 May 2012|author=David S.

The United States and Pakistan had nearly completed a deal to reopen crucial NATO supply routes into Afghanistan in June 2012, when Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said the US was &quot;reaching the limits of our patience&quot; over Islamabad's failure to root out Afghan insurgents in its tribal areas. In the wake of Panettas comments deputy assistant secretary of Defense Peter Lavoy was not allowed to meet with the Pakistani Army Chief, General [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]], and the Pentagon announced that it was bringing home a negotiating team that had worked in the Pakistani capital for nearly two months to end the bitter impasse over the supply routes. A senior US official disputed the notion that Panetta's criticism of Pakistan had set back the talks. &quot;The sticking point for a long time has been the apology issue,&quot; the official said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense Secretary Panetta's Pakistan comments complicate talks|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-talks-20120613,0,7893198.story|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=12 June 2012|author=David S.

Among the immediate repercussions of the incident is that the United States' attempts to end the war in Afghanistan peacefully may now be in jeopardy. Some Pakistani officials warned that the attack could have &quot;huge implications&quot; for the Afghan endgame. Pakistan, which is designated as a [[major non-NATO ally]] by the United States and is seen as a key facilitator in bringing the United States to the negotiations table with the [[Taliban|Afghan Taliban]] and the [[Haqqani Network]], had already halted those efforts according to an unnamed Pakistani official close to the military establishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghan endgame&quot;/&gt;

While addressing a [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] committee, the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Hina Rabbani Khar]] warned that a repeat incident could end Pakistan's support to the United States in its war against militancy. &quot;Enough is enough. The government will not tolerate any incident of spilling even a single drop of any civilian or soldier's blood. [[Pakistan's role in the War on Terror]] must not be overlooked.&quot; She added that &quot;the sacrifices rendered by Pakistan in the war on terror are more than any other country.

Retired Brigadier Mahmood Shah, former chief of security in the tribal areas, said that so far the US has blamed Pakistan for all that is happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan's point of view has not been shown in the international media, so the matter should be taken up by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. He advised Pakistani authorities to shoot down NATO aircraft should a similar event take place in the future, and to keep the supply lines closed, on the argument that the US cannot afford a war with Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2066488/U-S-helicopter-attack-killed-28-Pakistan-troops-act-self-defence.html |title=Pakistan gives US 2-week ultimatum to abandon 'secret' airbase and closes border &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Momand |first=Shams |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/26/us-pakistan-nato-idUSTRE7AP03S20111126 |title=Pakistan stops NATO supplies after deadly raid |publisher=Reuters |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oneclick.indiatimes.com/article/0fP57Qp4yI16Z?q=Afghanistan |title=Pakistan demands U.S. vacate air base within 15 days |publisher=Oneclick.indiatimes.com |accessdate=29 November 2011 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/middle-east/6041277/Cross-border-NATO-raid-kills-up-to-14-Pakistani-troops |title=Cross-border raid kills 28 Pakistanis |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |url=http://www.lhrtimes.com/2011/11/26/nato-helicopters-attack-on-pakistani-border-post-kills-25-soldiers/ |title=NATO helicopters attack on Pakistan border post kills 26 soldiers&amp;nbsp;– The Lahore Times |publisher=Lhrtimes.com |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Inter Services Public Relations]] (ISPR), a media wing of the Pakistani military, released a statement calling the attack unprovoked and said that chief of army staff, General [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]] had called the incident unacceptable and &quot;directed that all necessary steps be under taken for an effective response to this irresponsible act&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;defense&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=8375544&amp;c=AIR&amp;s=TOP |title=Pakistan Condemns 'Unprovoked' Border Attack |publisher=Defensenews.com |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One senior Pakistani military official said &quot;the latest attack by NATO forces on our post will have serious repercussions as they, without any reasons, attacked on our post and killed soldiers asleep.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail&quot;/&gt;

The televised funeral ceremony of the soldiers who died was held in [[Peshawar]] and was attended by several high-level military and political figures, including the Chief of Army Staff. Afterwards, their bodies were dispatched to their native towns for burial. The soldiers hailed from various regions, including three from [[Azad Kashmir]] alone, while the Major was from [[Larkana]] and the Captain from [[Sahiwal]]. Family members of Major Mujahid Mirani and Captain Usman Ali said the soldiers &quot;sacrificed their lives&quot; for the country and that they were proud of those sacrifices.  The Army Chief later also paid a visit to the injured soldiers, who had been transported to the [[Combined Military Hospital]] (CMH) in Peshawar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AH Nizami / Manzoor Ali |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/298770/pakistan-buries-troops-amid-fury-over-nato-strike-2/ |title=Pakistan buries troops amid fury over NATO strike |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2011, referring to Pak-US military, intelligence, political and diplomatic co-operation, the Pakistani Prime Minister announced that there would be no more business with the US and the relations between the two countries would never be the same again.  Later the Director General of ISPR, Abbas, announced that NATO's apology was not accepted and the attack would have serious consequences. He said that NATO's regret over the attack was not enough and such incidents had happened in the past, killing 72 soldiers and injuring more than 250 troops in three years.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} While addressing a gathering of journalists at a military headquarters, Pakistan Army Major-General Ashfaq Nadeem described the Salala incident as a &quot;deliberate act of aggression&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/world/2011/11/30/nato-attack-was-blatant-aggression-pakistan-army|title=NATO attack was blatant aggression: Pakistan army|work=[[Times Live]]|date=30 November 2011|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said it was &quot;next to impossible&quot; that NATO did not know they were attacking Pakistani forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;newser&quot;&gt;[http://www.newser.com/article/d9raebf00/pakistan-to-boycott-key-meeting-in-germany-in-protest-over-nato-raid-that-killed-its-troops.html Pakistan to boycott key meeting in Germany in protest over NATO raid that killed its troops] {{wayback|url=http://www.newser.com/article/d9raebf00/pakistan-to-boycott-key-meeting-in-germany-in-protest-over-nato-raid-that-killed-its-troops.html |date=20111129141612 |df=y }}, Newser&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on drone attacks, a senior Pakistani official said that predator drones &quot;will never be allowed back, at [[Shamsi Airbase|Shamsi]] or anywhere else&quot; although he hinted that American military trainers may be allowed back into the country to train Pakistani security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/325020/us-military-trainers-allowed-but-not-drones-report/|title='US military trainers allowed, but not drones': Report|work=Express Tribune|date=21 January 2012|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan had previously dumped American security personnel out of the country, following a covert operation by US special forces that [[Death of Osama bin Laden|killed Osama bin Laden]] in the town of Abbottabad in May 2011 and strained Pakistan's relations with the United States. As of January 2012, foreign affairs minister Hina Rabbani Khar said Pakistan's ties with the United States were &quot;still on hold&quot; over the NATO air-attack and that until the re-evaluation was not complete, Washington could not ask Islamabad to pursue militant groups or assist in the Afghan peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/324091/relations-with-us-based-on-mutual-respect-interest-fo/|title=Pakistan-US ties still on hold over NATO attack: Khar|work=Express Tribune|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, [[Bilawal Bhutto Zardari]], son of President Zardari and chairman of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], toughened his stance when he called on President Obama to &quot;show some courage&quot; and &quot;apologise to Pakistan&quot; over the raid.

* The [[Tehrik-i-Taliban]] (TTP) said NATO's attack on Pakistani check posts proved that the US &quot;can never be a friend of Pakistan&quot; and said Pakistan ought to take revenge for the incident and cut off its ties with the USA. A TTP spokesperson maintained that no peace talks were being held with the government of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/298791/slave-country-america-is-no-friend-says-taliban/ |title=America is no friend, says Taliban |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third parties====
[[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]], a British socialist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Socialists and the Middle East revolutions: John Rees|url=http://www.counterfire.org/index.php/articles/46-video/10738-socialists-and-the-middle-east-revolutions-john-rees|newspaper=Counterfire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Socialism in the 21st century|url=http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj100/rees.htm|newspaper=International Socialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/node/7124|title=When John Rees justified ditching working-class socialism| newspaper=Workers' liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-war political activist, called the NATO attack an &quot;extremely dangerous incursion&quot; and argued that the US and its allies were creating instability in the nuclear-armed country. Ahmed Qureshi, an Islamabad-based analyst, said during the same interview with state-run ''[[Russia Today]]'' that the prevailing public outrage may force the government and the army to take some decisive measures against the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/helicopters-checkpoint-killed-military-273/ Pakistan seals border in response to NATO attack], [[Russia Today]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian analyst Brian Cloughley said the attack would have severe consequences: &quot;This is quite outrageous and I have no doubt it signifies the end of the last lingering shreds of trust that the Pakistani army had for the U.S.&quot;. According to Coughley, the USAF had full knowledge of the locations of Pakistani border posts, and thus there was no excuse for this incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;defense&quot;/&gt;

An article from the ''[[Asia Times]]'' by M K Bhadrakumar explains that US should learn from its experience with Iran. It has no answer to a resolute nation in its will to put up against an enemy and Pakistan is going to give a &quot;[[Iran–United States relations|Persian response]]&quot; this time if the intention was to intimidate its army. According to Bhadrakumar, Pakistan's calculated response following the attack stops short of directly terminating its participation in the war although in essence, this event may push Pakistan's army &quot;within inches of doing that&quot; in the long-term scenario.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asia Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=M K Bhadrakumar|title=US and Pakistan enter the danger zone|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/MK29Df02.html|publisher=Asia Times|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report published in the newspaper ''[[Pakistan Observer]]'' claimed that some military and defence observers at [[Islamabad]] believed NATO was playing a double game and was in league with the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban]]; according to the report, there was a theory being circulated which suggested that the attack carried out by NATO came just when some Tehrik-i-Taliban (TTP) militants from Afghanistan who had entered the region had been completely encircled by Pakistani forces and were about to be eliminated &quot;within the next few hours&quot;. These check posts were there to check them and prevent from crossing the border in to Pakistan. Pakistani monitors and experts on Afghanistan believed that at least two Afghan military officials deployed on the border, [[Brigadier General]] Aminullah Amarkhel and [[Colonel]] Numan Hatifi (of the 201st Silab Corps), have [[anti-Pakistan sentiments]] and links to anti-Pakistani elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO Attack was to rescue TTP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Akhtar Jamal|title=NATO attack was launched to rescue TTP militants|url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=127616|publisher=Pakistan Observer|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO Attack was to rescue TTP-ref2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO attack was launched to rescue TTP militants|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=9fc_1322626437|publisher=Live Leak|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Air Marshal (Retd) Shahid Lateef: NATO attack on Army checkpoint launched to rescue TTP militants|newspaper=CNBC Pakistan (TV)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in ''[[People's Daily]]'', China's top state newspaper, accused the United States and NATO of flouting international law and fanning terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/299415/china-paper-says-us-fans-terror-by-pakistan-attack/ |title=China paper says US fans terror by Pakistan attack|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=29 November 2011|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, many Chinese scholars, analysts and members of leading think tanks also expressed strong criticism of NATO's attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ftpapp.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=168795&amp;Itemid=39|title=Chinese scholars, civil society strongly condemn NATO-ISAF attack|work=[[Associated Press of Pakistan]]|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former spokesperson for the US state department said China, which is a [[People's Republic of China–Pakistan relations|close ally of Pakistan]], &quot;sees this as a target of opportunity, both to tweak the US and to subtly suggest to Pakistan that if it really sours of its relationship with the US, it has an alternative&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chinesereaction&quot;/&gt;

Writing for the Pakistani newspaper ''[[Express Tribune]]'', Indian blogger Sanjay Kumar said the attack had elicited various reactions in [[India]], with some vocal sections who saw Islamabad in &quot;the prism of prejudice and paranoia&quot; expressing glee and delight at the discomfort and supposed humiliation of their [[Indo-Pakistani relations|arch-rival western neighbour]]. Kumar opinionated that &quot;such sick thought has many takers in this healthy democracy which prides itself as the voice of the third world countries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/9307/pakistan%E2%80%99s-trouble-can-never-be-india%E2%80%99s-gain/|title=Pakistan's trouble can never be India's gain|work=Express Tribune|date=12 December 2011|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An opinion piece by Abdul Ruff Colachal published on the ''Indian Muslim Observer'' titled &quot;NATO terrorism in Pakistan&quot; said that Pakistan's leadership was &quot;interested mainly in promoting US imperialist goals and western capitalist interests&quot; rather than protecting the interests of its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianmuslimobserver.com/2011/12/nato-terrorism-in-pakistan-is-pakistani.html|title=NATO terrorism in Pakistan: Is Pakistani regime really serious about people|work=Indian Muslim Observer|first=Abdul Rauf|last=Colachal|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
