*[[Aviation Design]] (http://www.adjets.com/)
*[[AMT Advanced Micro Turbines]] (http://www.amtjets.com/)
Aviation Design doesn't mention it but i think AMT refers to the Netherlands based company. It could be a custom model as AD produces several customs devices. the best is to mail them and ask about it. [[User:Shame On You|Shame On You]] 15:59, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

==Dassault A.V.E.==
i'm currently thinking about renaming this article &quot;Dassault AVE&quot; as i orginally planned to develop separated articles for each model but now i'm rather happy with how it turned out (and there are no that much unveilled data). i should ask Dassault what is the best name. i saw an Aviation Design promo poster named &quot;'''[http://perso.orange.fr/aviationdesign/uav/uav2/AVE%20.jpg Dassault A.V.E]'''&quot; i don't know by now, i'll figure it out later.

==Is there a first-flight date for AVE-C?==
Is there? [[User:Akradecki|Akradecki]] 19:41, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
:official infos regarding the AVE-C are hard to find and non-official sources are contradictries some claims it has bomb bay, while it is supposed to be an UAV not UCAV. infos about the maiden flight are also vague, some source calaims 2001 others third trimestre (06.2004). check the mentionned sources in the article: 2001 comes from Defence Ministry report at the French Senate, and 2004 comes from the [http://www.european-security.org/index.php?id=4674 European-Security website]. both are official sources (i used the sources mentioned in the article). i found various screenshots from video of flying AVE-C but the sources are not unveiled (must come from old dassault promo video or possibly from a dassault insider). i'll check youtube further. its like about the &quot;C&quot; in AVE-C (Moyen Duc), i found the &quot;D&quot; meaning in the French Senate report but the &quot;C&quot; was not defined. the guy who posted the unknown pics claims &quot;C&quot; is for &quot;combat&quot; hence the Moyen Duc sometimes refered as an UCLA instead of a T-UAV. as i was not sure i didn't defined the &quot;C&quot; in the article. i need more official data. a gound thing would be to mail both the DGA (nEUROn project chief master) and Dassault. i'm currently seeking an official cool real photo about the AVE-C for the article so i can use the current replica for the Grand Duc section.

the guy posted official past press releases from dassault i believe these pictures are real stuff including the Petit Duc escort.
:ok, understand. I was just updating the Aviation Timeline pages, and there's a section for first flights in there. [[User:Akradecki|Akradecki]] 21:41, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

==ain't it cute?==
found an official flight video of the [http://perso.orange.fr/aviationdesign/uav/video/ave_tv.avi Petit Duc] (source Dassault) ain't it cute :) [[User:Shame On You|Shame On You]] 20:07, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

==Saab FILUR...==
is it me or the FILUR (2005) is a copy and a mix design of the Petit Duc (2000) &amp; Moyen Duc (2001)? [http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/Frtypen/Fotos/saab/FilurEf.JPG check this real -not CG concept- test flight pic (10.2005)]. That makes Saab's role in the nEUROn project overrated. [[User:Shame On You|Shame On You]] 12:09, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

==Sagem UAV proto 2003 (nEUROn?)==
this interesting [http://modelscale.free.fr/reportages/LBO_03P/img21.jpg picture] of a Sagem UAV was shot at the Paris Air Show 2003 and demonstrates a similarity with the 2006 revised design of the nEUROn. That makes Saab's supposed major influence on the euro project even more relative. Few infos are released yet about the Dassault-Sagem TUAV, the amateur photograph suggests it could be a concept for the 2004 Dassault-Sagem Medium Duc.

==Moyen Duc flight==
finally found the [http://www.dassault-aviation.com/gb/technologie/HigherTechnology-va-vod.zip video (english vers)] used by the guy in the forum showing moyen duc. so this is official Moyen Duc flew. here's the french version of the [http://www.dassault-aviation.com/technologie/HigherTechnology-vf-vod.zip video]. does anyone understand the Rafale's pilot vocal order to the drone? to me sounds like English message: &quot;...three&quot;...&quot;successful!&quot; and the Petit Duc on the left leaves the formation (sounds seems to be higher in the FR vers.).

*from this promo film i've made an [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjvF7VD2AD4 edited video focusing on the drones footages]. at first i was skeptic about the Rafale with the three AVE, but after examination of screenshots this is not 3DCG. looks like real footage (just like the Petit Duc &amp; Moyen Duc sequences are real film without any doubt). if the Rafale and Petit Duc sequence is a fake this a fake film not 3DCG fake, Dassault's CG level is not that good, just have a look at the nEUROn video released one year later. anyway a fake would be surprising as the Petit Duc really flew (there are filmed and pictured evidences), and when Dassault relates to project in its promo it uses mute poor to medium quality 3DCG while this sequence has sound and speech.
