Retrieved: 16 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; employed by [[Japan]] towards the end of [[World War II]].

==Design and development==
The MXY-7 Navy Suicide Attacker ''Ohka'' was a manned [[flying bomb]] that was usually carried underneath a [[Mitsubishi G4M]]2e &quot;Betty&quot; Model 24J [[bomber]] to within range of its target. On release, the pilot would first glide towards the target and when close enough he would fire the ''Ohka''{{'}}s three [[solid-fuel rocket]]s, one at a time or in unison,&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon1979p477&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=477.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fly the missile towards the ship that he intended to destroy.

The design was conceived by [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Mitsuo Ohta of the 405th [[Kōkūtai]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon1979p476&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=476.}}&lt;/ref&gt; aided by students of the Aeronautical Research Institute at the [[University of Tokyo]]. Ohta submitted his plans to the Yokosuka research facility. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] decided the idea had merit and Yokosuka [[Military engineer|engineers]] of the [[Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal]] (Dai-Ichi Kaigun Koku Gijitsusho, or in short ''Kugisho''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mikesh and Abe|1990|p=262.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) created formal blueprints for what was to be the MXY7. The only variant which saw service was the Model 11, and it was powered by three Type 4 Mark 1 Model 20 rockets. 155 ''Ohka'' Model 11s were built at Yokosuka, and another 600 were built at the [[Kasumigaura, Ibaraki|Kasumigaura]] Naval Air Arsenal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon1979p477&quot;/&gt;

The final approach was difficult for a defender to stop because the aircraft gained high speed ({{convert|650|km/h|abbr=on}} in level flight and {{convert|930|km/h|abbr=on}} or even {{convert|1000|km/h|abbr=on}} in a dive). Later versions were designed to be launched from coastal air bases and caves, and even from [[submarine]]s equipped with [[aircraft catapult]]s, although none were actually used in this way. It appears that the operational record of ''Ohka''s includes three ships sunk or damaged beyond repair and three other ships with significant damage. Seven U.S. ships were damaged or sunk by ''Ohka''s throughout the war. The {{USS|Mannert L. Abele|DD-733|6}} was the first Allied ship to be sunk by ''Ohka'' aircraft, near [[Okinawa]] on 12 April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francillon|1971|p=117.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=478.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ohka'' pilots, members of the ''Jinrai Butai'' (Thunder Gods Corps), are honored in Japan at ''Ohka'' Park in Kashima City, the ''Ohka'' Monument in Kanoya City, the Kamakura ''Ohka'' Monument at [[Kenchō-ji]] [[Zen temple in Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], and the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in Tokyo.

[[File:MXY7 Ohka Cherry Blossom Baka Ohka-11.jpg|thumb|300px|Disarming the bomb]]
[[File:MXY7 Ohka Cherry Blossom Baka Ohka-3bs.jpg|thumb|300px|Thermojet powered Model 22, note the jet intake]]

The only operational ''Ohka'' was the '''Model 11'''. Essentially a 1,200&amp;nbsp;kg (2,646&amp;nbsp;lb) bomb with wooden wings, powered by three Type 4 Model 1 Mark 20 [[solid-fuel rocket]] motors, the Model 11 achieved great speed, but with limited range. This was problematic, as it required the slow, heavily laden mother aircraft to approach within {{convert|37|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}} of the target, making them very vulnerable to defending [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s. There was one experimental variant of the Model 11, the Model 21, which had thin steel wings manufactured by [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]. It had the engine of the Model 11 and the airframe of the Model 22.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon1979p481&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=481.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ohka K-1''' was an unpowered trainer version with water ballast instead of warhead and engines, to provide pilots with handling experience. 45 were built by Dai-Ichi Kaigun Koku Gijitsusho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francillon|1979|pp=478, 482.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Model 22''' was designed to overcome the short standoff distance problem by using a [[Secondo Campini|Campini]]-type [[Motorjet|thermojet engine]], the [[Tsu-11]]. This engine was successfully tested, and 50 Model 22 ''Ohka''s were built at Yokosuka to accept this engine. The Model 22 was to be launched by the more agile [[Yokosuka P1Y|Yokosuka P1Y3]] ''Ginga'' &quot;Frances&quot; bomber, necessitating a shorter wing span and much smaller 600&amp;nbsp;kg (1,320&amp;nbsp;lb) warhead. None appears to have been used operationally, and only three of the experimental Tsu-11s engines are known to have been produced.

The '''Model 33''' was a larger version of the Model 22 powered by an [[Ishikawajima Ne-20]] [[turbojet]] with an 800&amp;nbsp;kg (1,760&amp;nbsp;lb) warhead. The mothership was to be the [[Nakajima G8N]] ''Renzan''. Model 33 was cancelled due to the likelihood that the ''Renzan'' would not be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francillon|1979|pp=441, 479.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other unbuilt planned variants were the '''Model 43A''' with [[folding wing]]s, to be launched from submarines, and the '''Model 43B''', a catapult/rocket assisted version, also with folding wings so that it could be hidden in caves.&lt;ref name= &quot;Francillon1979p481&quot;/&gt; A [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]] version was also under development for this version, the two-seat '''Model 43 K-1 Kai Wakazakura (Young Cherry)''', fitted with a single rocket motor. In place of the warhead, a second seat was installed for the student pilot. Two of this version were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=482.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the '''Model 53''' would also use the [[Ishikawajima Ne-20|Ne-20 turbojet]], but was to be towed like a glider and released near its target.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon1979p481&quot;/&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:Yokosuka Ohka Model 22.svg|thumb|Yokosuka ''Ohka'' Model 22]]
{{Refimprove|date=December 2012}}

The Yokosuka MXY7 ''Ohka'' was used mostly against U.S. ships invading Okinawa, and if launched from its mothership, could be effective because of its high speed in the dive.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, Wayland. [http://www.b-29s-over-korea.com/Japanese_Kamikaze/Japanese_Kamikaze05.html &quot;Japanese Suicide Weapons: The Kugisho MXY7-K1 Ohka.&quot;] ''b-29s-over-korea.com.'' Retrieved: 1 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two attempts to transport the ''Ohka''s to Leyte Gulf using aircraft carriers, the carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shinano||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Unryu||2}} were sunk by the U.S. submarines {{USS|Archer-Fish|SS-311|2}} and {{USS|Redfish|SS-395|2}}.

Attacks intensified in April 1945. On 1 April 1945, six &quot;Bettys&quot; attacked the U.S. fleet off [[Okinawa]]. At least one made a successful attack; its ''Ohka'' was thought to have hit one of the 406&amp;nbsp;mm (16&amp;nbsp;in) turrets on the battleship {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}, causing moderate damage. Postwar analysis indicated that no hits were recorded and that a near-miss took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kightly&quot;/&gt; The transports {{USS|Alpine|APA-92|2}}, {{USS|Achernar|AKA-53|2}}, and {{USS|Tyrrell|AKA-80|2}} were also hit by ''kamikaze'' aircraft, but it is unclear whether any of these were ''Ohka''s from the other &quot;Bettys&quot;. None of the &quot;Bettys&quot; returned.

The U.S. military quickly realized the danger and concentrated on extending their &quot;defensive rings&quot; outward to intercept the &quot;Betty&quot;/''Ohka'' combination aircraft before the suicide mission could be launched.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kightly&quot;/&gt; On 12 April 1945, nine &quot;Bettys&quot; attacked the U.S. fleet off Okinawa. The destroyer {{USS|Mannert L. Abele|DD-733|2}} was hit, broke in two, and sank, witnessed by [[LSMR-189]] CO James M. Stewart. {{USS|Jeffers|DD-621|2}} destroyed an ''Ohka'' with [[Anti-aircraft|AA]] fire 45&amp;nbsp;m (50&amp;nbsp;yd) from the ship, but the resulting explosion was still powerful enough to cause extensive damage, forcing ''Jeffers'' to withdraw. The destroyer {{USS|Stanly|DD-478|2}} was attacked by two ''Ohka''s. One struck above the waterline just behind the ship's bow, its charge passing completely through the hull and splashing into the sea, where it detonated underwater, causing little damage to the ship. The other ''Ohka'' narrowly missed (its pilot probably killed by anti-aircraft fire) and crashed into the sea, knocking off the ''Stanly''{{'}}s ensign in the process. One Betty returned. On 14 April 1945, seven &quot;Bettys&quot; attacked the U.S. fleet off Okinawa. None returned. None of the ''Ohka''s appeared to have been launched. Two days later, six &quot;Bettys&quot; attacked the U.S. fleet off Okinawa. Two returned, but no ''Ohka''s had hit their targets. Later, on 28 April 1945, four &quot;Bettys&quot; attacked the U.S. fleet off Okinawa at night. One returned. No hits were recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kightly&quot;/&gt;

May 1945 saw another series of attacks. On 4 May 1945, seven &quot;Bettys&quot; attacked the U.S. fleet off Okinawa. One ''Ohka'' hit the bridge of a minesweeper, {{USS|Shea|DM-30|2}}, causing extensive damage and casualties. {{USS|Gayety|AM-239|2}} was also damaged by an ''Ohka''{{'}}s near miss. One &quot;Betty&quot; returned. On 11 May 1945, four &quot;Bettys&quot; attacked the U.S. fleet off Okinawa. The destroyer {{USS|Hugh W. Hadley|DD-774|2}} was hit and suffered extensive damage and flooding. The vessel was judged beyond repair. On 25 May 1945, 11 &quot;Bettys&quot; attacked the fleet off Okinawa. Bad weather forced most of the aircraft to turn back, and none of the others hit targets.

On 22 June 1945, six &quot;Bettys&quot; attacked the fleet. Two returned, but no hits were recorded. Postwar analysis concluded that the ''Ohka''{{'}}s impact was negligible, since no U.S. Navy capital ships had been hit during the attacks because of the effective defensive tactics that were employed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kightly&quot;&gt;Kightly, James. &quot;Yokosuka Ohka Kamikaze Pilot.&quot; ''Aeroplane'', Volume 39, No. 7, Issue no. 459, July 2011, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
