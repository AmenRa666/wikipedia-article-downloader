{{Japanese name|Fukudome}}
{{nihongo|'''Shigeru Fukudome'''|福留 繁|Fukudome Shigeru|extra= February 1, 1891 &amp;ndash; February 6, 1971}} was an admiral and Chief of Staff of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in [[Yonago, Tottori|Yonago]], [[Tottori prefecture]], Fukudome graduated from the 40th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in 1913, ranked 8 out of 144 cadets. As a [[midshipman]], he served on the [[cruiser]]s [[Japanese cruiser Soya|''Soya'']] and [[Japanese cruiser Izumo|''Izumo'']] and [[battleship]] [[Japanese battleship Satsuma|''Satsuma'']]. After his promotion to [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]], he was assigned to the battleship [[Japanese battleship Hizen|''Hizen'']] and cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Kashima|''Kashima'']].

After attending [[torpedo]] school and [[naval artillery]] school, he served on the patrol boat ''Manshu'', followed by the cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Chitose|''Chitose'']] and was promoted to [[lieutenant]] in 1918. After attending navigational training, he was assigned as chief navigator to the [[destroyer]] [[Japanese destroyer Sakura|''Sakura'']], and cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Niitaka|''Niitaka'']]. He was then appointed [[executive officer]] on the oiler ''Kamoi'', on its voyage to the [[United States]] from 1921-1922. After his return to Japan, he was assigned a number of staff positions. He then graduated from the [[Naval War College (Japan)]] with honors in 1924, and was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]]. After a tour as chief navigator on the cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Iwate|''Iwate'']], he joined the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]] and was promoted to [[commander]] in 1929. He continued to hold a number of staff positions through the 1930s. He was promoted to captain in 1933, and was captain of the battleship [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] from 1938-1939. He was promoted to [[rear admiral]] on  November 15, 1939.

===Pacific War===
Fukudome was first assigned to the [[Combined Fleet]] in 1940 to April 1941 (where he conducted [[aerial torpedo]] exercises with Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] in early 1940 in contemplation of the proposed [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]), which was then under discussion. After his promotion to [[vice admiral]] in 1942, he again served as Chief of Staff under Admiral Yamamoto and his successor Admiral [[Mineichi Koga]] from May 1943 to March 1944,

On March 31, 1944, while traveling from [[Palau]] to deliver plans for the Japanese counterattack against the [[Marianas Islands]] (code named &quot;[[Z Plan (Japan)|Z plan]]&quot;) to Japanese headquarters near [[British North Borneo]], Fukudome had the dubious distinction of being the first flag officer in Japanese history to be captured by the enemy (Filipino guerillas) after his plane crash landed in a storm near [[Cebu Island|Cebu]]. (Admiral Koga, who had been traveling in a separate plane was killed on the same day). He was released by the Americans to prevent retaliation on civilians by Japanese forces, but the battle plans fell into American hands.&lt;ref&gt;Bradsher, The Z-PLan Story&lt;/ref&gt;

After Koga's death in March 1944, Fukudome became [[commander-in-chief]] of the 6th Air Base and [[2nd Air Fleet]], based in the Kyūshū-Okinawa-Formosa district. He later noted that this appointment was out of convenience, arguing that since he had no experience with [[naval aviation]], his assignment to a newly formed air unit must be because of the immediate need for an officer of flag rank. On October 10, 1944, the headquarters of the 2nd Air Fleet moved from [[Katori, Chiba|Katori]] in [[Chiba Prefecture]] to [[Taiwan]]; at the same time as the headquarters move, the 200 [[Imperial Japanese Army]] aircraft present in Taiwan were assigned to him to bolster his 100-aircraft fleet, with additional reinforcements coming in later in smaller quantities over time.

In late October 1944, because of the heavy losses of Japanese air units in the [[Philippines]], Fukudome's responsibility was expanded to cover the Philippines as well. He moved his headquarters to [[Manila]] on October 22. Another 450 aircraft reached [[Clark Field]] over the next two days to join the approximately 100 aircraft that were already there under Vice Admiral [[Takijirō Ōnishi]], who became his chief of staff. 

In Jan 1945, the 2nd Air Fleet was dissolved and merged with the 1st Air Fleet. With the merger of the two air fleets in the Philippines, Fukudome was transferred to [[Singapore]] to command the [[10th Area Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|IJN 10th Area Fleet]], which at the time consisted mainly of the [[13th Air Fleet]] with 450 aircraft (mostly trainers) and the [[Southern Expeditionary Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#Southern Expeditionary Fleet/1st Southern Expeditionary Fleet|IJN 1st Southern Expeditionary Fleet]] (2 operational cruisers and other smaller ships). He arrived in Singapore and took over command on January 16, 1945, and remained in this role until the end of the war. Because of the American control of air and sea after the Philippines campaign, he was effectively stranded in Singapore without the ability to affect the outcome of the war in a significant way.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Vat, Pacific Campaign: The U.S.-Japanese Naval War 1941-1945&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Fukudome was interrogated in [[Tokyo]] between December 9–12, 1945 by Rear Admiral [[Ralph A. Ofstie]] of the [[United States Navy]]. In addition to the cooperative interrogation with the Americans, Fukudome was also entrusted by the British to take charge of repatriating Japanese nationals from the Singapore area.&lt;ref&gt;USSBS, Interrogations of Japanese Officials&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the high regard and trust extended by American and British officers due to Fukudome’s cooperative behavior and attitude, once the task of repatriation was accomplished, Fukudome was arrested by the British government at the instigation of American prosecutors, and accused of [[war crime]]s; he was tried by a [[military tribunal]] in Singapore in connection with the execution of two downed American airmen during his tenure in Singapore, and found guilty of negligence in the performance of his duties.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, World War II Database&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2012}}

Following his release in 1950, Fukudome became a member of a 12-man commission to advise the Japanese government on the organization of the [[Japanese Self-Defense Force]] before his death in 1971. His grave is at the [[Tama Cemetery]] in [[Fuchu, Tokyo|Fuchu]], outside of Tokyo.
