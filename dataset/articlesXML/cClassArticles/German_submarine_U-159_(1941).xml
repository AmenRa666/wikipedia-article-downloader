'''German submarine ''U-159''''' was a [[German Type IX submarine|Type IXC]] [[U-boat]] of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' built for service during [[World War II]]. The keel for this boat was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 11 November 1940 at the [[DeSchiMAG]] [[AG Weser]] yard in [[Bremen]], Germany as yard number 1009. She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 1 July 1941 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 4 October under the command of ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' [[Helmut Witte]] ([[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]]).

The U-boat's service began with training as part of the [[4th U-boat Flotilla]]. She then moved to the [[10th U-boat Flotilla|10th flotilla]] on 1 May 1942 for operations. She sank 22 ships, totalling {{GRT|119,554|disp=long}} and damaged one more of 265 tons.

She was sunk by an American aircraft in July 1943.

==Design==
[[German Type IX submarine#Type IXC|German Type IXC submarines]] were slightly larger than the original [[German Type IXB submarine|Type IXB]]s. ''U-159'' had a displacement of {{convert|1120|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|1232|t|LT}} while submerged.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}} The U-boat had a total length of {{convert|76.76|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[pressure hull]] length of {{convert|58.75|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.76|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|9.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|4.70|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two [[MAN SE|MAN]] M 9 V 40/46 [[supercharged]] four-stroke, nine-cylinder [[diesel engine]]s producing a total of {{convert|4400|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while surfaced, two [[Siemens-Schuckert]] 2 GU 345/34 [[Motor–generator|double-acting electric motors]] producing a total of {{convert|1000|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two {{convert|1.92|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[propeller]]s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to {{convert|230|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}}

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|18.3|kn}} and a maximum submerged speed of {{convert|7.3|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}} When submerged, the boat could operate for {{convert|63|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|13450|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. ''U-159'' was fitted with six {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 [[torpedo]]es, one [[10.5 cm SK C/32 naval gun|{{convert|10.5|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} SK C/32 naval gun]], 180 rounds, and a {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} as well as a {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a [[Ship's company|complement]] of forty-eight.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}}

==Service history==

===1st and 2nd patrols===
The submarine's first patrol took her from [[Kiel]] on 22 April 1942, across the [[North Sea]] and into the Atlantic Ocean through the [[GIUK gap|gap]] between the [[Faroe Islands|Faroe]] and [[Shetland Islands]]. She arrived at [[Lorient]], in occupied France, on 3 May. She would be based at this Atlantic port for the rest of her career.

''U-159''{{'}}s second sortie proved to be successful, sinking ships such as ''Montenol'' on 21 May 1942 {{convert|140|nmi|abbr=on}} east southeast of Santa Maria, in the [[Azores]]. She also attacked ''Illinois'', which with a cargo of 8,000 tons of manganese ore, sank in 40 seconds. The U-boat's [[deck gun]] got plenty of use, sinking ''Sally'' on 5 June and ''Flora'' on the 18th. On another occasion, due to rough seas, the weapon could not be used in the attack on the Brazilian sailing ship ''Paracury''; her 20mm AA gun was used instead. Holes at the waterline were shot into the vessel, which capsized but did not sink. The wreck was subsequently recovered and repaired.
The boat was attacked by a [[Leigh Light]] equipped [[Vickers Wellington]] aircraft of [[No. 172 Squadron RAF]] on 13 July 1942. She was severely damaged and barely managed to reach Lorient, some 12 hours later.

===3rd patrol===
Her third foray was to the South Atlantic and at 135 days, her longest and most destructive. Attacking and sinking among others, ''Boringia'', the''Empire Nomad'' and ''Ross''. The boat was attacked by a SAAF [South African Air Force] [[Lockheed Ventura]] on 10 October 1942; only minor damage was sustained. She also torpedoed and sank ''La Salle'' on 7 November 1942. When the ships' cargo of ammunition exploded, it was heard at the Cape Point lighthouse, more than {{convert|300|nmi|abbr=on}} away. Another of her victims, ''Star of Scotland'', (which despite the name was registered in the US), was a steel sailing ship which was attacked and sunk with the deck gun about {{convert|900|nmi|abbr=on}} west of [[Luderitz Bay]], South Africa. Her master was to be taken away as a prisoner, but he was returned to his men after he pointed out to the submariners that he was the only man who could navigate.

Another &quot;Star&quot;, ''Star of Suez'', was sunk. Amongst the floating debris were 45 aircraft tyres, a 20&amp;nbsp;hp electric motor and 120 grapefruits; they were recovered by ''U-159''. Another U-boat, {{GS|U-134|1941|2}}, which had been thwarted in her attempt to get into an attacking position in time, also managed to rescue some aircraft tyres and spare parts for cars.

===4th patrol===
On her fourth patrol, ''U-159'' sank ''Silverbeech'' on 28 March 1943 south of the [[Canary Islands]]. The U-boat was attacked by aircraft (she was one of eight), off the coast of Spanish, (now Western) [[Western Sahara|Sahara]].

===5th patrol and loss===
[[File:U-159 Bomben.jpg|thumb|right|''U-159'' attacked and sunk by a PBM-3C of VP-32 on 28 July 1943.]]
Her final patrol saw ''U-159'' depart Lorient on 12 June 1943. She was sunk by a US Navy [[Martin PBM Mariner|Mariner]] aircraft of [[VP-46|VP-32]].

===Wolfpacks===
''U-159'' took part in two [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]s, namely.
* Wohlgemut (12–22 March 1943) 
* Seeräuber (25–30 March 1943)
