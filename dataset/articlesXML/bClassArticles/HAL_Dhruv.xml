The '''HAL Dhruv''' is a [[utility helicopter]] developed and manufactured by [[India]]'s [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] (HAL). The development of the Dhruv was first announced in November 1984, and it was subsequently designed with assistance from [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm|MBB]] in Germany. The helicopter first flew in 1992; however, its development was prolonged due to multiple factors including the [[Indian Army]]'s requirement for design changes, budget restrictions, and sanctions placed on India following the 1998 [[Pokhran-II]] nuclear tests.

The Dhruv entered service in 2002. It is designed to meet the requirement of both military and civil operators, with military variants of the helicopter being developed for the [[Indian Armed Forces]], while a variant for civilian/commercial use has also been developed. The helicopter was first exported to [[Nepal]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/hal-to-hand-over-first-export-dhruvs/348441/ |title=HAL to hand over first export Dhruvs|first=Ajai|last=Shukla |work=Business Standard |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military versions in production include transport, utility, reconnaissance and medical evacuation variants. Based on the Dhruv platform, the [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter]] (LCH) a dedicated attack helicopter and [[HAL Light Utility Helicopter]] (LUH), a utility and observation helicopter, are currently being developed. As of August 2013, more than 200 HAL Dhruv have been produced for different customers.

==Development==

===Origins===

The ''Advanced Light Helicopter'' (ALH) program for an indigenous 5-ton multirole helicopter was initiated in May 1979 by the Indian Air Force and [[Indian Naval Air Arm]].&lt;ref name ='hirsch 49'/&gt; HAL were given a contract by the Indian government in 1984 to develop the helicopter;&lt;ref name ='hirsch 49'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Datta 2008, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]] (MBB) were contracted in July 1984 as a design consultant and collaborative partner on the programme.&lt;ref name= &quot;JAWA03 p185&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= 'khan 248'&gt;Khan 2004, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally scheduled to fly in 1989, the first prototype ALH (Z-3182) made its maiden flight on 20 August 1992 at [[Bangalore]] with the then-Indian Vice President [[K R Narayanan]] in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn 2004, pp. 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a second prototype (Z-3183) on 18 April 1993, an Army/Air Force version (Z-3268), and a navalised prototype (IN.901) with Allied Signal CTS800 engines and a retractable tricycle undercarriage.&lt;ref name= &quot;JAWA03 p184&quot;&gt;Jackson , p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Development problems arose due to changing military demands and a funding shortfall in the wake of the [[1991 Indian economic crisis]].&lt;ref name ='hirsch 49'&gt;Hirschberg 2011, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval testing on board the [[INS Viraat]] and other ships started in March 1998, and around the same time a weight-reduction programme was initiated.&lt;ref name= 'dhruv janes'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-All-the-Worlds-Aircraft/HAL-Dhruv-India.html |title= HAL Dhruv (India), Aircraft – Rotary-wing – Civil/military |publisher= Jane's |date= 13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, further delays in development were caused when sanctions were implemented against India following a number of [[Pokhran-II]] nuclear tests in 1998 and India's continued refusal to sign the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]]. As a result, the intended engine for the helicopter, the [[LHTEC T800]], was [[embargo]]ed.&lt;ref name= 'dhruv janes'/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;dhruv paris buslin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2005/07/05/stories/2005070500361800.htm |title= Dhruv on wings at Paris |work= Business Line |date= 5 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turbomeca]] TM 333-2B2 [[turboshaft]] engine was selected as a replacement; in addition Turbomeca agreed to develop a more powerful engine with HAL, originally known as the ''Ardiden''.&lt;ref name= 'flight152005'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2005/02/15/193906/aero-india-hal-to-target-maritime-contract.html |title= Aero India – HAL to target maritime contract |work= Flight International |date= 15 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turbomeca also assisted in the development of the helicopter, stress analysis and studies of rotor dynamics were conducted in France.&lt;ref&gt;Standing Committee of Defence 2007, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The first flight of a Dhruv with the new engine, renamed the [[HAL/Turbomeca Shakti|''Shakti'']], took place on 16 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hal-india.com/dhruv-shakti.asp |title=Dhruvs with Shakti engine and weapons make maiden flight |publisher=HAL |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/19/stories/2007071950150900.htm |title=Shakti-powered ALH to fly on August 1 |work=[[The Hindu]]|first=Ravi|last=Sharma|date=19 July 2007 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further development===

The [[HAL Rudra]], earlier known as Dhruv-WSI (''Weapons Systems Integrated''), is an attack variant designed for the Indian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/army-to-soon-get-indigenous-weaponised-chopper-advanced-light-helicopter-rudra/articleshow/9857201.cms |title= Army to soon get indigenous weaponised chopper Advanced Light Helicopter 'Rudra' |work= The Times of India |date= 5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development was sanctioned in December 1998&lt;ref&gt;Standing Committee of Defence 2007, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and the prototype first flew on 16 August 2007; it is to be armed with both anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, and a 20-mm turret-mounted cannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.hindu.com/2007/08/17/stories/2007081762311700.htm |title= Weaponised version of Dhruv makes maiden flight |work= The Hindu |date= 17 August 2007 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dhruv-WSI is to be capable of conducting [[Close air support|combat air support]] (CAS) and [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) roles as well.&lt;ref&gt;Standing Committee of Defence 2007, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Dhruv-WSI, HAL is also developing the [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter|Light Combat Helicopter]] (LCH) based on the Dhruv for the Indian Armed Forces. It is fitted with stub wings for carrying up to eight anti-armour missiles, four air-to-air missiles, or four pods loaded with either 70&amp;nbsp;mm or 68&amp;nbsp;mm rockets. The LCH will also have FLIR ([[Forward Looking Infrared]]), a CCD ([[Charge Coupled Device]]) camera, and a target acquisition system with laser rangefinder and thermal vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-05-24/bangalore/28317274_1_lch-light-combat-helicopter-pilot |title= Indigenous combat copter takes to skies |work= The Times of India |date= 24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IA-1136 HAL Dhruv (Indian Army).jpg|thumb|left|A Dhruv of the Indian Army]]

In 2005, following a crash landing of a Dhruv, the entire fleet was grounded when it was discovered to have been caused by excessive vibration of the tail rotor. Following a redesign which incorporated new materials in addition to changes in design methodology, the Dhruv undertook recertification and returned to service shortly after March 2006.&lt;ref name= &quot;deccanchronicle.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;outlookmar10&quot;/&gt; In April 2007, a report published by the Indian Committee of Defence noted the Dhruv as one of four &quot;focus areas&quot; identified as having high export potential.&lt;ref&gt;Standing Committee of Defence 2007, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, HAL and partner [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] (IAI) announced that they were jointly developing the Dhruv to operate as an unmanned maritime helicopter, stating customer interest in such a feature.&lt;ref name= 'flight201101'&gt;{{cite web |first= Arie |last= Egozi |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/01/06/351501/iai-to-help-india-develop-unmanned-dhruv.html |title= IAI to help India develop unmanned Dhruv  |work= Flight International |date= 6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first five production Dhruv Mk III, powered by the more powerful Shakti engine, were delivered to the [[Leh]]-based 205 Aviation Squadron on 7 February 2011 during a ceremony at HAL's Helicopter Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shukla|first=Ajai|title=In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|work=Business Standard|accessdate=21 August 2011|date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, India's [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)|Directorate General of Civil Aviation]] certified a Dhruv simulator developed by HAL and Canadian developer [[CAE Inc.|CAE Inc]]; the simulator is easily modifiable to simulate different variants of the Dhruv and other helicopters such as the [[Eurocopter Dauphin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Greg |last= Waldron |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/07/12/357273/india-certifies-first-dhruv-simulator.html |title= India certifies first Dhruv simulator  |work= Flight International |date= 12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's [[Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory]] (DEBEL) has been developing an oxygen life-support system to improve the helicopter's high-altitude performance, and as of August 2010 the IAF has ordered development of this system for the Dhruv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Anantha |last= Kristnan M. |url= http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?id=news/awx/2010/08/13/awx_08_13_2010_p0-247830.xml&amp;topicName=India |title= India Develops Oxygen System for High-Altitude Helo Flights |publisher= Aviation Week |date= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, HAL reported that the Indian Army had ordered a further 159.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/hal-making-159-dhruvs-for-indian-army/463354/ |title= HAL making 159 Dhruvs for Indian Army |work= Business Standard |date= 1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:IA Dhruv Berlin-08.jpg|thumb|Indian Army Dhruv at [[Internationale Luft- und Raumfahrtausstellung|ILA 2008]]]]

The HAL Dhruv is of conventional design; about 29 percent of its empty weight (constituting 60 percent of the airframe's surface area) is composite materials.&lt;ref name= &quot;Brasseys99 p298&quot;&gt;Taylor 1998, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the unique [[carbon fibre]] composite developed by HAL reduced the helicopter's weight by 50 percent.&lt;ref name =&quot;datta14&quot;/&gt; The high tail boom allows easy access to the rear doors. The twin 1000&amp;nbsp;shp [[Turbomeca TM 333|Turbomeca TM333-2B]] turboshafts are mounted above the cabin and drive a four-blade composite main rotor. The main rotor can be manually folded; the blades are mounted between carbon-fibre-reinforced plates, the rotor head is constructed from fibre elastomers.&lt;ref name= &quot;JAWA03 p185&quot;/&gt; In February 2004, US helicopter company [[Lord Corporation]] were awarded a contract to develop an active vibration control system (AVCS), which monitors onboard conditions and cancels out fuselage vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Lord wins Dhruv active vibration control deal |magazine=[[Flight International]] |issue=3–9 February 2004 |page=27 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2004/2004-04%20-%200029.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cockpit section of the fuselage is of [[Kevlar]] and [[carbon-fibre]] construction; it is also fitted with [[crumple zone]]s and [[crashworthiness|crashworthy]] seats. The aircraft is equipped with a SFIM Inc four-axis automatic flight control system. Avionics systems include a HF/UHF communications radio, [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] recognition, Doppler navigation, and a radio altimeter; a weather radar and the Omega navigation system were options for the naval variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempGaurdsOffHome.aspx?MnId=M1YqbUPxvIo=&amp;ParentID=pt1+ZmXUE8Y= |title= Equipment: Dhruv |publisher= Indian Army |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAI has also developed targeting systems and an [[electronic warfare]] suite for the Dhruv, as well as avionics for day-and-night flight observation.&lt;ref name= 'flight201101'/&gt; HAL's claim that the Dhruv is indigenous has been challenged by [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]], who reported that as of August 2010 the helicopter was: &quot;...against the envisaged indigenisation level of 50% (by 2008), 90% of the value of material used in each ALH is still imported from foreign suppliers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-06/india/28310212_1_alhs-advanced-light-helicopter-cag |title= Indigenous? Dhruv advanced light helicopters are '90% foreign' |work= The Times of India |date= 6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, it was reported that the Dhruv's Integrated Dynamic System (IDS), which combines several key rotor control functions into a single module carrying the engine's power to the rotors,&lt;ref name= &quot;JAWA03 p185&quot;&gt;Jackson 2003, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; was suffering from excessive wearing and was necessitating frequent replacement; as a consequence the cruising speed had been restricted to 250&amp;nbsp;km/h and high-altitude performance was lessened as well.&lt;ref name= &quot;busstad 092010&quot;&gt;Shukla, Ajai, &quot;Indian Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopter gets Italian makeover &quot;, ''Business Standard'', 12 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; HAL contracted Italian aerospace firm [[Avio]] for consultancy purposes and they subsequently replicated production of the IDS in Italy in order to isolate the problem with the early testing of the Dhruv subsequently being criticised as &quot;rushed&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;busstad 092010&quot;/&gt; In June 2011 HAL has reported that the issue had been resolved and not present in the Dhruv Mk III, a number of alterations both to the design and production had been made to improve the IDS. A programme of retrofitting the Mk I and Mk II was completed by June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-06-01/news/29608382_1_light-combat-helicopter-lch-attack-helicopters/2 |title= Hindustan Aeronautics sees spike in light combat helicopter orders |work= The India Times |date= 1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALH Mk-III with Shakti engines has very good high altitude performance operating at altitudes over 6&amp;nbsp;km. It comes with seating for 14 fully equipped troops. DGCA has praised its crashworthy design as a few accidents have not caused any fatalities.&lt;ref name=ai15jae&gt;{{cite web |author=Group Captain (Retd) Hari Nair |title=Lessons learnt from ALH Project |url=http://aeroindiaseminar.in/admin/technical/pdf/_1358752354PaperLessonslearntfromALHProject.pdf |publisher=Aero India |year= 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2013}} [http://www.livefistdefence.com/2013/02/alh-dhruv-truth-first-hand.html alternate copy].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==

===Indian service===

Deliveries of the Dhruv commenced in January 2002, nine years after the prototype's first flight, and nearly eighteen years after the program was initiated.&lt;ref name= &quot;JAWA03 p184&quot;/&gt; The [[Indian Coast Guard]] was the first service to operate the Dhruv; this was followed by the [[Indian Army]], [[Indian Navy]], [[Indian Air Force]] and the [[Border Security Force]]. 75 Dhruvs were delivered to the Indian armed forces by 2007, and as of 2008 it was planned to produce 40 helicopters annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.india-defence.com/reports-3887 |title=Peru, Ecuador Place Orders for HAL  Dhruv ALH Helicopters |publisher=India Defence |date=29 June 2008 |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indian Air Force]]'s [[Sarang (military)|Sarang]] aerobatic display team performs using 4 Dhruv helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-07-14/news/28441034_1_dhruv-helicopters-sarang-farnborough-air-show |title=Dhruv helicopter display in Farnborough Air Show |work=The Economic Times |date=14 July 2008 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a further order for 166 helicopters was placed by the Indian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Ajai |last= Shukla|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=333870 |title=Light Combat Helicopter to fly soon: India's New Helicopters: Part II |date= 9 September 2008 |work=Business Standard |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/23/stories/2007122358280900.htm |title= HAL’s Dhruv gets CCS approval |work= The Hindu |date= 23 December 2007 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; India may order up to 12 Dhruvs outfitted with an onboard emergency medical suite, to be used by the Armed Forces Medical Services for [[MEDEVAC]] purposes.&lt;ref name= 'army ambulances'/&gt;

The Dhruv is capable of flying at high altitudes, as it was an Army requirement for the helicopter to be able operate in the [[Siachen Glacier]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmir]] regions.

In 2007, [[Amnesty International]] stated it possessed evidence that India planned to transfer two Dhruvs to [[Burma]], and pointed to the use of European-sourced components as a possible violation of the [[European Union]] (EU) arms embargo against that country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6900052.stm#map &quot;'Threat' to EU-Burma embargo&quot;], ''[[BBC News]], 16 July 2007.

Quote: A government source who asked not to be named, denied any wrongdoing and said India &quot;does not attach much credence to reports by Amnesty International. India does give defense hardware support to Myanmar but the equipment is not offensive ... and not top of the line technology,&quot; said the source, asserting that Myanmar was helping in the battle against insurgents in India's northeast. Another Indian official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the technology concerned was for communications only and not for offensive operations.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the Indian Navy gifted a Dhruv to the [[Maldives National Defence Force]] for conducting search and rescue and medical evacuation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://airforcenews.ru/play/bFHv1t0oPno/MALDIVES_RECEIVES_IT%2527S_DHRUV_HELICOPTER_%252C_GIVEN_BY_INDIAN_GOVT..html |title=HAL Dhru to Maldives |publisher= airforcenews.ru |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a second Mk.III equipped with a [[weather radar]] was donated in December 2013.
