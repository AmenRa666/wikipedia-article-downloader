The '''10th Special Forces Group (Airborne)''' ('''10th SFG(A)''' or '''10th Group''') is an active duty [[United States Army Special Forces]] (SF) Group. The 10th Group is responsible for operations within the [[United States European Command|EUCOM]] [[area of responsibility]], as part of the Special Operations Command, Europe ([[SOCEUR]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Global Security&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=10th Special Forces Group (Airborne)|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/10sfg.htm|accessdate=10 May 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514175712/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/10sfg.htm| archivedate= 14 May 2008 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10th Group has also been involved in parts of [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. In 2009, as part of a new [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]] directive, the group is now also responsible for operations within the [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]] area of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOCom directive announces major changes &amp;#124; Army Times &amp;#124; armytimes.com &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://www.armytimes.com/article/20090827/NEWS/908270331/SOCom-directive-announces-major-changes |work= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HsSJalef?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.armytimes.com%2Farticle%2F20090827%2FNEWS%2F908270331%2FSOCom-directive-announces-major-changes |archivedate=5 July 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-07-01 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

10th SFG(A) was formed on 19 June 1952, at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina|Fort Bragg]], North Carolina, under the command of Colonel [[Aaron Bank]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=10th SFG Official History |url=http://www.soc.mil/SF/history.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=10 May 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090920094659/http://www.soc.mil/SF/history.pdf |archivedate=20 September 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was split in 1953, with one half being sent to Germany, while the other half remained at Fort Bragg to form the core of the [[7th Special Forces Group (United States)|77th Special Forces Group]] (redesignated as the 7th SFG in 1960).&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;/&gt; In 1968, the majority of the unit transferred to [[Fort Devens]], [[Massachusetts]], with the exception of 1st Battalion, which remained in Germany. Between 1994 and 1995, 10th SFG(A) moved to [[Fort Carson]], [[Colorado]], which remains its current home.

10th Group began training with [[unconventional warfare]] groups from friendly countries in the 1960s, beginning with [[NATO]] allies. The group has also trained various components of the militaries of several [[Middle Eastern]] countries, including [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Yemen]], [[Iran]], as well as [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] tribesmen. Units of the 10th SFG(A) have participated in [[humanitarian]] missions to the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo]], [[Somalia]], and [[Rwanda]]. 10th SFG(A) was deployed to [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1991 during the [[Gulf War|First Persian Gulf War]]. The 10th SFG has been heavily involved in the [[War on Terrorism]], deploying to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[North Africa]], [[Afghanistan]], and consistently to [[Iraq War|Iraq]].

==History==

===1950s===
[[File:SpecialForces Badge.svg|thumb|right|The Regimental Insignia of the Special Forces.]]
In 1950, the [[Lodge-Philbin Act|Lodge Act]] was passed, which provided for the recruiting of foreign nationals into the United States military. It was originally planned that half of the members of the Special Forces would be native Europeans. Many of the initial members of the 10th SFG(A) were Lodge Act recruits, who were strenuously anti-Communist.&lt;ref name=Southworth&gt;{{Cite book

By the end of June 1952, the group had 122 officers and men assigned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;/&gt; Many had been [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]], and [[Airborne forces|Airborne]] troopers during [[World War II]]. The group's mission was to conduct partisan warfare behind Soviet lines in the event of a Soviet invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=Pushies&gt;{{Cite book

| postscript =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 1953, the 10th SFG(A) was split in half, with one half deployed to [[Bad Tölz]] and [[Lenggries]] in [[West Germany]], and the other remaining in Fort Bragg to become the 77th Special Forces Group (which in 1960 became the [[7th Special Forces Group]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pushies&quot;/&gt;

The green beret was authorized for wear by Col. William E. Ekman, the group commander, in 1954, and it became group policy. By 1955, every soldier in the unit wore a green beret as part of the uniform. However, the Department of the Army (DA) did not recognize the beret as headgear. The DA banned the wear of the beret, but it was later restored by President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], a major champion of the Special Forces.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{Cite book

The 10th Group encountered publicity for the first time in 1955 when the ''[[New York Times]]'' published two articles about the unit, describing them as a &quot;liberation&quot; force designed to fight behind enemy lines. Pictures showed soldiers of the group wearing their berets, with their faces blacked out to conceal their identities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;/&gt;

===1960s===
The A-teams of 10th Group began exchange training with unconventional forces in friendly countries, including United Kingdom, Germany, France, Norway, Spain, Italy, and Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;/&gt; This training taught 10th Group soldiers how to subsist on native food, and built valuable rapport with the host nation forces.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the summer of 1960, 10th Group deployed to the newly independent [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo]], to evacuate Americans and Europeans to [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]], where there would be a larger evacuation, led by Belgian paratroopers. The group evacuated 239 civilians without a single casualty in only nine days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;/&gt;

As the United States became increasingly involved in Vietnam, counter-insurgency became the primary focus of the Special Forces, rather than the traditional unconventional warfare. While the 10th SFG(A) was never deployed to Vietnam, the soldiers and officers assigned to it did rotate through the country as part of different special forces groups.&lt;ref name=Hagerman&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Vietnam era organization chart for Special Forces groups.GIF|thumb|300px| left| Special Forces Group organization in the Vietnam Era]]
During the Vietnam War, detachments of 10th Group began training Middle Eastern special warfare forces. In Jordan, B Detachment established the first airborne school, and King Hussein attended the graduation parachute jump.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagerman&quot;/&gt; In 1963, Company C of 10th Group trained 350 officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] of a guerrilla force fighting the socialist government in Yemen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagerman&quot;/&gt; Detachments also traveled to Iran to train the Iranian Special Forces, along with Kurdish tribesmen in the mountains of Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagerman&quot;/&gt; A-Teams also trained Turkish and [[Special Services Group|Pakistani special forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagerman&quot;/&gt;

In 1968, 10th Group, minus the 1st Battalion, was transferred to [[Fort Devens]], Massachusetts. 1st Battalion remained in Bad Tölz, Germany.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===1970s – 1980s===
Following the military cuts after the end of the Vietnam War, operational deployments decreased in both number and frequency. However 10th Group still deployed frequently to Europe to train with [[NATO]] allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;/&gt;

From 11 May 1983 to 25 October 1985, 10th Group deployed 17 Mobile Training Teams (MTT) to Lebanon, to support the Lebanese Army. The teams created a training program for over 5,000 officers, NCOs, and soldiers, which included basic training sites, unit training, unit combined arms live fire training, and urban live fire training. The [[Lebanese Civil War#Syrian intervention|entry of the Syrian Army]] into Lebanon ended the program prematurely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;/&gt;

An MTT from the 1st Battalion, Bad Tolz, Germany deployed to [[Operation Restore Hope|Somalia]] for four months to conduct disaster relief operations in June 1985. In 1986, a detachment of 10th Group trained the nucleus of the Nigerian Airborne forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;/&gt;

The 10th Group was the leading force behind the development of the [[M25 Sniper Rifle|M25]] [[sniper rifle]] in the late 1980s, at Fort Devens. The rifle is an improvement on the previous [[M21 Sniper Weapon System|M21 sniper rifle]], itself a modification of the [[M14 rifle|M14]] semi-automatic rifle.

===1990s – 2000s===

Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, an MTT deployed to Kuwait to train the [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]]. During the [[Battle of Khafji]], the MTT accompanied the SANG forces into battle, coordinated troop movements, called in airstrikes, and assisted with artillery fire support. Other elements of 10th Group deployed to southeast Turkey in support of operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. The ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reported: &quot;The 10th Special Forces Group's penchant for secrecy is so exacting the base publicist didn't know the unit had gone to war until they were on their way home from Operation Desert Storm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soc.mil/SF/history.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009025542/http://www.soc.mil/SF/history.pdf |date=9 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the Gulf War, [[Saddam Hussein]] turned his attention to Iraq's Kurdish minority, causing over half of a million Kurds to flee into the mountains on the Turkish-Iraqi border. Under the leadership of Colonel William Tangney, all three battalions of 10th Group were deployed to the area for [[Operation Provide Comfort]], a UN humanitarian effort. 10th Group coordinated the ground relief effort, and was credited by [[John Galvin (soldier)|General Galvin]], the [[EUCOM]] commander, as having &quot;saved half a million Kurds from extinction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;/&gt;

During [[Operation Restore Hope]], 10th Group deployed a Coalition Support Team to support the 1st Belgian Para-Commando Battalion. In addition to supporting the Para-Commando unit, the CST assisted the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]], and provided security for meetings with Somali leaders. Following the ethnic conflict in Rwanda, 10th Group deployed to [[Entebbe]] airfield, Uganda. The group assisted the displaced persons in returning to their homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official History&quot;/&gt;

On 2 September 1994, 2nd Battalion, 10th SFG(A) transferred to [[Fort Carson]], [[Colorado]], followed by 3rd Battalion on 20 July 1995. The group headquarters moved to Fort Carson on 15 September 1995, ending a 27-year presence in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Global Security&quot;/&gt;

Affiliated for operations with Special Operations Command – [[United States European Command|Europe]], 10th Group is continuing to conduct [[Joint Combined Exchange Training]] and FID/anti-terrorist operations as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Pushes Anti-Terrorism in Africa|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/25/AR2005072501801.html|accessdate=10 May 2008 | work=The Washington Post | date=26 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They organized the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] to defeat [[Ansar al-Islam]], an ally of [[al-Qa'ida]], for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely under Ansar al-Islam's control. This battle, one of the most important engagements for Special Forces since Vietnam, led to the elimination of a substantial number of terrorists and the discovery of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat (the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war). Three [[Silver Star]]s and six [[Bronze Star]]s for valor were conferred for this engagement.&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews1&quot;&gt;[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/041018/18excerpt.htm A firefight in the mountains: Operation Viking Hammer was one for the record books – US News and World Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  These terrorists would have been part of the subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle, which could be called the Tora Bora of Iraq. While several key leaders escaped into Iran, it was a sound defeat for al-Qaeda and Ansar al-Islam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Operation Hotel California 2008&quot;&gt;Operation Hotel California: The Covert War Inside Iraq, Sam Faddis and Mike Tucker, Publisher: Lyons Press, The Pub.

This effort kept Saddam's forces, including 13 Armored Divisions, in the north and denied them the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort likely saved the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of coalition service members.&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Operation Hotel California 2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plan of Attack, Bob Woodward, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
