==Source of original article==
Through working with Civil War historian Bryan S. Bush, I requested that he write a [http://www.bryansbush.com/hub.php?section=authorship&amp;page=articles&amp;layer=a0606 &quot;Louisville During the Civil War&quot; article] released under a GFDL compatible license, namely the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License.  Even though I could copy the text verbatim and re-use it with an attribution without having to get permission, I went an extra step and got Bryan's permission for republishing as a Wikipedia article, given I would make many formatting and content changes for better use in the Wikipedia, and with the understanding that other editors will contribute many changes over time.

:Bryan Bush just added a lot of new content to his article at the link above.  It still has a Creative Commons license, so anybody is welcome to incorporate the new content into this article.

== Jefferson General Hospital ==
I found a picture of Jefferson General Hospital, which was the 3rd largest Civil War hospital, located in Jeffersonville.  It's already uploaded

In case you wondered, I got the photo from an 1909 book entitled ''History of Clark County, Indiana''.  It was most useful for filling out the histories of various Clark County towns.  Since it's before 1923, we have free use of it.  Ther was also a picture of the Quadangle, but the image quality wasn't that great, which is why I haven't uploaded it yet (it was too dark).--[[User:Bedford|Bedford]] 20:23, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for the info. You could upload the Quadrangle image, then I could Photoshop it to brighten it. By the way, I discovered another source of images -- I'll bring it up in the WikiProjects for Louisville and Kentucky.

==Civil War Defenses of Louisville (1864-1865)==
I'm not sure how to properly integrate this info into the article as of yet, but Bryan Bush has supplied me with information on the fortifications around Louisville from 1864-1865, apparently constructed (even though ultimately useless) under the orders of [[Stephen G. Burbridge]].  These forts were listed in the book &quot;The Falls City Engineers&quot; by Leland R. Johnson, 1974 &amp; 1984.

Eleven (or is it twelve?) Union forts protected the city, in a ring about ten miles long from [[Beargrass Creek]] to Paddy's Run.  Nothing remains of these constructions.  They included, from east to west:
*Fort Elstner between Frankfort Ave. and Brownsboro Road, near Bellaire, Vernon and Emerald Aves.
*Fort Engle at Spring Street and Arlington Ave.
*Fort Saunders at [[Cave Hill Cemetery]].
*Battery Camp Fort Hill (2) (1865) between Goddard Ave., Barrett and Baxter Streets, and St. Louis Cemetery.
*Fort Horton at Shelby and Merriweather Streets (now site of city incinerator plant).
*Fort McPherson on Preston Street, bounded by Barbee, Brandeis, Hahn and Fort Streets.
*Fort Philpot at Seventh Street and Algonquin Parkway.
*Fort St. Clair Morton at 16th and Hill Streets.
*Fort Karnasch on Wilson Ave. between 26th and 28th Streets.
*Fort Clark (1865) at 36th and Magnolia Streets.
*Battery Gallup (1865) at Gibson Lane and 43rd Street.
*Fort Southworth on Paddy's Run at the Ohio River (now site of city sewage treatment plant).  Marker at 4522 Algonquin Parkway.

Also in the area were:
*Taylor Barracks, at Third and Oak Streets, an induction center for Union African-American troops.
*Camp Gilbert (1862), undetermined location.
*Camp C. F. Smith (1862), undetermined location.

==Undue weight on executions==
While the executions in retaliation under Burbridge (1864 and after) are detailed, including the names of all the suspected Confederate guerrillas who were killed, there is little discussion except a generality about why martial law was thought necessary, and what the toll had been before it was imposed.  This could be dealt with by treating the later information in a more summary fashion, without the listing of each execution, or providing more material on what preceded Burbridge's command.  It certainly appeared he overreacted, but a more balanced account would be useful.--[[User:Parkwells|Parkwells]] ([[User talk:Parkwells|talk]]) 15:50, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

:Perhaps there should be a separate article on executions ordered by Burbridge.  It definitely is too much to list them all in this article.--[[User:Parkwells|Parkwells]] ([[User talk:Parkwells|talk]]) 19:36, 23 April 2009 (UTC)</text>
