'''USS ''Trousdale'' (AKA-79)''' was a {{sclass|Tolland|attack cargo ship}} of the [[United States Navy]] named after [[Trousdale County, Tennessee]]. She was designed to carry military cargo and [[landing craft]], and to use the latter to land weapons, supplies, and [[Marine (armed services)|Marines]] on enemy shores during [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]]. She served as a commissioned ship for 16 months.

''Trousdale'' was laid down as a [[Type C2 ship|Type C2-S-AJ3 ship]] under a [[Maritime Commission]] contract (MC hull 1386) on 22 April 1944 at [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], by the [[North Carolina Shipbuilding Co.]]; launched on 3 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. J. R. Craig; delivered to the Navy under loan-charter on 24 July 1944; and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] at Hoboken, N.J., on 21 December 1944, Lt. Comdr. William J. Lane, USNR, in command.

==Service history==

===World War II, 1945===
The attack cargo ship conducted shakedown training off [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and in the [[Virginia Capes]] area and proceeded to [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], to load cargo earmarked for the Pacific theater of operations. On 27 January, ''Trousdale'' headed for the open sea in company with {{USS|Charles E. Brannon|DE-446|3}}, bound for [[Panama]]. She transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 2 February and sailed for [[Hawaii]] on 3 February.
 
Reaching [[Pearl Harbor]] on 17 February, ''Trousdale'' spent the next 25 days unloading cargo; making minor repairs; and waiting for orders. In mid-March 1945, she unloaded her first combat cargo — miscellaneous units of the [[Tenth United States Army|10th Army]], including signal battalions, military police, a weather squadron, communications companies, bomb disposal units, and occupational government personnel, together with 200 vehicles and 900&amp;nbsp;tons of equipment. On 14 March 1945, ''Trousdale'' set out for the [[Marshall Islands]].
 
After anchoring at [[Eniwetok]] on 22 March, the ship headed for the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], arriving at [[Ulithi]] on 29 March. She got underway for the [[Ryukyus]] on 13 April and arrived off [[Okinawa]] on the 17th.
 
''Trousdale'' anchored off [[Hagushi]] beach while the amassed battleships, cruisers, and destroyers shelled Japanese defenses further inland. After commencing unloading that evening, she temporarily suspended operations as Japanese &quot;[[kamikazes]]&quot; flew in from the north to attempt to crash American ships engaged in the landings.
 
Hampered by kamikazes and bad weather conditions with heavy seas and high winds, the ship lay off the beach for the next six days, engaged in nearly continuous unloading operations. On 22 April, she joined a south-bound convoy and, on 27 April, made port at [[Saipan]], where she transferred all of her [[landing craft]], save two, to other ships.
 
Crossing the [[equator]] on 7 May, ''Trousdale'' anchored off [[Guadalcanal]] on the 9th and soon commenced loading equipment belonging to rear-echelon units of the [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Division]]. On 18 May, the ship weighed anchor and steamed for [[Tulagi]], where she loaded landing craft and set out, via [[Eniwetok]] and Saipan, for [[Guam]], arriving there on 7 June.
 
On 13 June, the attack cargo ship sailed for the west coast, making port at [[San Francisco]]. The ship then underwent minor repairs and loaded a cargo of oil and a new set of [[landing craft]] before setting a westerly course on 10 July, bound for [[Tinian]], the American B-29 bomber base in the [[Marianas]].
 
Meanwhile, the war in the Pacific was drawing to a close as American forces swept close to the Japanese home islands themselves. Carrier planes and ships offshore bombarded coastal targets; planes and ships made the sea lanes untenable for Japanese sea power; and the Japanese air force rapidly dwindled in numbers.
 
Arriving at Tinian on 27 July, the ship commenced offloading immediately and was working hard at the task on 5 August when an [[Enola Gay|American B-29 bomber]] exploded an [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb over Hiroshima]]. ''Trousdale'' completed discharging her cargo on the 8th and shifted her anchorage to Saipan the same day. While she was anchored there on 15 August, word came through that [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] had accepted the terms of the [[Potsdam Declaration]] and capitulated to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The long and bloody war in the Pacific was over.

===Post-war activities, 1945&amp;ndash;1946===
Yet for ''Trousdale'', and ships like her, the occupation operations were just commencing. Accordingly, the ship departed [[Saipan]] on 29 August, arriving at [[Okinawa]] on 4 September. The attack cargo ship spent a week loading Army equipment for occupation forces and, in company with three other AKA's, sailed on 11 September for [[Korea]].
 
En route, lookouts sighted [[Naval mine|mines]] drifting in the murky waters of the [[East China Sea|East China]] and [[Yellow Sea]]s. Gunfire from the ships destroyed these menaces to navigation. The ships made port at [[Jinsen]] on 13 September and commenced offloading soon after arrival. The AKA's encountered difficulties posed by the 20- to 30-foot tidal range which permitted larger landing craft to discharge cargo only at specific times. After completing the unloading operations, the ships headed back to Okinawa, arriving there on 18 September.
 
''Trousdale'' then embarked marines for passage to [[Taku, China]]. Anchoring off Taku Bar, the ship sent her landing boats up the [[Wei River]] for special duties, while unloading the marines for occupation duty. Orders soon came, sending ''Trousdale'' to the [[Philippines]]. She departed the China coast on 6 October, and — after steaming through a [[typhoon]] so intense that the ship's inclinometer recorded 55-degree rolls — reached [[Manila]] on 13 October 1945. There, the ship took on fuel and provisions and was soon underway for [[Hong Kong]]. Upon her arrival in the vicinity of the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong, the ship prepared to embark Chinese soldiers for passage to North China.
 
[[Chiang Kai-shek]], as he had done during [[Second Sino-Japanese War|the war with Japan]], sought American assistance in his as yet undeclared [[Chinese Civil War|war against the communists]]. This included the air lift and sea lift of [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist troops]] to cities in northern China, population centers rapidly coming under the influence of the communist forces who had taken pains to encourage popular support while fighting the Japanese.
 
Accordingly, ''Trousdale'' took on board large contingents of Chinese troops, many of whom had never before been on a ship. Commencing the loading on 24 October, the operation was completed the next day, and the ship sailed with her human cargo for [[Qinhuangdao|Chinwangtao]] at the base of the [[Great Wall of China]]. Making port on 30 October, she offloaded her troops and returned southward for another load — the Chinese First Division — making port at Hong Kong on 7 November and departing two days later for [[Tsingtao]] where she arrived on 14 November.

While remaining at Tsingtao, the ship received urgent boiler repairs. The attack cargo ship got underway again on 14 November for Japan and arrived at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] on the 20th. The ship sailed on New Year's Day, 1946, bound, via [[Midway Island]], for the west coast.

''Trousdale'' moored at [[San Diego]], California, on 18 January 1946, but soon headed for [[Panama]] and steamed through the [[Panama Canal|Canal]] on 2 February, exactly one year to the day since her first transit. She arrived at [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk]], Virginia, on 11 February and, six days later, headed for the [[New York Navy Yard]] to prepare for decommissioning.

===Decommissioning and Sale===
On 6 March, the attack cargo ship departed [[New York City]] on her last voyage as a United States Navy man-of-war and arrived at [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk]] on the following day. ''Trousdale'' was decommissioned on 29 April 1946, returned to the [[War Shipping Board]] of the [[Maritime Commission]] on the 30th, assigned to the [[National Defense Reserve Fleet]], and berthed in the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 8 May 1946.

The ship was sold in 1947 to the [[Waterman Steamship Corporation]], of [[Mobile, Alabama]], and served as a merchant ship under the name SS ''Lafayette'' until purchased in 1954 by the Ocean Transportation Co., Inc., New York, N.Y., and renamed SS ''Ocean Deborah''. In 1962, she was purchased by the Central Gulf Steamship Corp., [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and renamed SS ''Green Dale''. She served under that name until 1970 when she was sold to a purchaser in [[Taiwan]] and, presumably, she was soon scrapped.

==Awards==
''Trousdale'' received one [[battle star]] for her [[World War II]] service at [[Okinawa]].
