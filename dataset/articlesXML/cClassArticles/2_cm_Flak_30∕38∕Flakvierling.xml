The '''Flak 30''' (''Flugabwehrkanone 30'') and improved '''Flak 38''' were 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[anti-aircraft gun]]s used by various German forces throughout [[World War II]]. It was not only the primary German light anti-aircraft gun, but by far the most numerously produced German artillery piece throughout the war.&lt;ref name=sv/&gt; It was produced in a variety of models, notably the '''Flakvierling 38''' which combined four Flak 38 [[autocannons]] onto a single carriage.

==Development==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-219-0597-15, Russland-Mitte-Süd, leichte Flak, Josef Niemitz.jpg|thumb|left|A Flak 38 mounted on a vehicle, Russia June 1943. Among the crew is [[Josef Niemietz]]]]
The Germans fielded the unrelated early 2&amp;nbsp;cm Flak 28 just after World War I, but the [[Treaty of Versailles]] outlawed these weapons and they were sold to [[Switzerland]].

The original Flak 30 design was developed from the [[Solothurn ST-5]] as a project for the [[Kriegsmarine]], which produced the '''20&amp;nbsp;mm C/30'''. The gun fired the &quot;Long Solothurn&quot;, a 20&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;138&amp;nbsp;mm belted cartridge that had been developed for the ST-5 and was one of the most powerful 20&amp;nbsp;mm rounds in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/an_introduction_to_collecting_20.htm An introduction to collecting 20 mm cannon cartridges]&lt;/ref&gt;

The C/30, featuring a barrel length of 65 [[calibre]]s, had a rate of about 120 rounds per minute. Disappointingly, it proved to have feeding problems and would often jam, which was offset to some degree by its undersized 20 round-magazine which tended to make reloading a frequent necessity. Nevertheless, the C/30 became the primary shipborne light AA weapon and equipped a large variety of German ships. The C/30 was also used experimentally as an aircraft weapon, notably on the [[Heinkel He 112]], where its high power allowed it to penetrate [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s and the light tanks of the era during the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[Rheinmetall]] then started an adaptation of the C/30 for Army use, producing the '''2&amp;nbsp;cm Flak 30'''. Generally similar to the C/30, the main areas of development were the mount, which was fairly compact. Set-up could be accomplished by dropping the gun to the ground off its two-wheeled carriage and levelling with hand cranks. The result was a triangular base that allowed fire in all directions.

The main problem with the design remained the fairly low rate of fire which, at 120&amp;nbsp;rpm was not particularly fast for a weapon of this calibre. Rheinmetall&lt;ref group=N&gt;The original source articles used to produce this single combined version state different companies for the manufacture of the various models. It suggested that [[Mauser]] produced all of the Flak 38 and later variants.&lt;/ref&gt; responded with the '''2&amp;nbsp;cm Flak 38''', which was otherwise similar but increased the rate of fire to 220&amp;nbsp;rpm and slightly lowered overall weight to 420&amp;nbsp;kg. The Flak&amp;nbsp;38 was accepted as the standard Army gun in 1939, and by the Kriegsmarine as the '''C/38'''.

In order to provide airborne and mountain troops with AA capabilities, [[Mauser]] was contracted to produce a lighter version of the Flak 38, which they introduced as the '''[[Gebirgsflak 38|2&amp;nbsp;cm Gebirgsflak 38]]''' ('''2&amp;nbsp;cm GebFlak 38'''). It featured a dramatically simplified mount using a tripod that raised the entire gun off the ground, which had the side benefit of allowing it to be set up on an uneven surface. These changes reduced the overall weight of the gun to a mere 276.0&amp;nbsp;kg. Production started in 1941 and entered service in 1942.

==Ammunition==
A wide variety of 20x138B ammunition was manufactured to be used in 2&amp;nbsp;cm Flak weapons; some of the more commonly used types are listed on the following table.&lt;ref name=&quot;bellum.nu&quot;&gt;20mm Suomessa - Aseet ja ampumatarvikkeet (20mm in Finland - Weapons and Ammunition). Pitkänen S., Simpanen T, 2007. ISBN 978-952-5026-59-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Other kinds than in existence included numerous practice rounds (marked ''Übung'' or ''Üb''. in German notation) and a number of different AP types. A high-velocity ''PzGr'' 40 round with a [[tungsten carbide]] core in an aluminium body existed in 20x138B caliber.

Even as the Flak 30 was entering service, the Luftwaffe and ''Heer'' (army) branches of the ''Wehrmacht'' had doubts about its effectiveness, given the ever-increasing speeds of low-altitude [[fighter-bomber]]s and attack aircraft. The Army in particular felt the proper solution was the introduction of the 37&amp;nbsp;mm caliber weapons they had been developing since the 1920s, which had a rate of fire about the same as the Flak 38, but fired a round with almost eight times the weight. This not only made the rounds deadlier on impact, but their higher energy and [[ballistic coefficient]] allowed them to travel to much longer distances, allowing the gun to engage targets at longer ranges. This meant it could keep enemy aircraft under fire over longer time spans.

The 20&amp;nbsp;mm weapons had always had weak development perspectives, often being reconfigured or redesigned just enough to allow the weapons to find use. Indeed, it came as a surprise when Rheinmetall introduced the '''2&amp;nbsp;cm Flakvierling 38''', which improved the weapon just enough to make it competitive once again. The term ''Vierling'' literally translates to &quot;quadruplet&quot; and refers to the four 20 mm gun constituting the design.

The ''Flakvierling'' weapon consisted of quad-mounted 2&amp;nbsp;cm Flak 38 AA guns with collapsing seats, folding handles, and [[ammunition]] racks. The mount had a triangular base with a jack at each leg for levelling the gun. The tracker traversed and elevated the mount manually using two handwheels. The gun was fired by a set of two pedals &amp;mdash; each of which fired two diametrically opposite Flak 38s &amp;mdash; and could be operated either automatically or semi-automatically. When raised, the weapon measured 307&amp;nbsp;cm (10 feet 1&amp;nbsp;inch) high.

Each of the four mounted guns had a separate magazine that held only 20 rounds. This meant that a maximum combined rate of fire of 1,400 rounds per minute was reduced practically to 800 rounds per minute for combat use – which would still require that a magazine is replaced every six seconds, on each of the four guns. The guns could be fired in pairs (diagonally opposite) or simultaneously, in either semi-automatic or fully automatic mode. The effective vertical range was 2200 metres. It was also used just as effectively against ground targets as it was against low-flying aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JZ9cSQNeK9cC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=flakvierling+ground+target&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hwAjp_9f3i&amp;sig=y-TFSuwzA51jHi9OGvO6Sl18itc&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=rEtBSsDjBYvA-Qa70ujACA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mounting versatility===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-005-0015-27, Jugoslawien, Polizeieinsatz, Truppentransport.jpg|thumb|left|The rear-location wheelhouse of this [[Siebel ferry]] features a ''Flakvierling'' quadmount AA battery to defend it in 1942 Yugoslavia.]]
The ''Flakvierling'' four-autocannon anti-aircraft ordnance system, when not mounted into any self-propelled mount, was normally transported on a Sd. Ah. 52 trailer, and could be towed behind a variety of [[half-track]]s or trucks, such as the [[Opel Blitz]], [[SdKfz 251]] and [[SdKfz 11]]. Its versatility concerning the vehicles it could be mounted to included its common use on half-tracks and tank hulls to produce mobile anti-aircraft vehicles, such as the [[SdKfz 7#Variants|SdKfz 7/1]] (based on the [[SdKfz 7]] half-track) and the [[Wirbelwind]] and original [[Möbelwagen]] prototype (both based on the [[Panzer IV]] tank). In Kriegsmarine use, it was fitted to [[U-boat]]s, [[Siebel ferry|Siebel ferries]] and ships to provide short-range anti-aircraft defence, and was also employed in fixed installations around ports, harbours and other strategic naval targets. The Flakvierling was also a common fixture on trains, even on [[Führer Headquarters#Special train (Führersonderzug)|Hitler's own command train]], where pairs of them were mounted on either end of a &quot;camelback&quot; flatbed car and then covered to make it look like a boxcar, sometimes with a pair of such twin-''Flakvierling'' mount cars for defense, one near each end of Hitler's ''Führersonderzug'' train.
