'''Andranik Ozanian''', commonly known as '''Andranik''' ({{lang-hy|Անդրանիկ}};{{efn-ua|Also spelled '''Antranik''' or '''Antranig''' and popularly known as '''General Andranik''' (Զորավար Անդրանիկ ''[[Romanization of Armenian|Zoravar Andranik]]'').{{sfn|Adalian|2010|p=79}} In [[classical Armenian orthography|classical orthography]] his name is spelled Անդրանիկ Օզանեան and pronounced {{IPA-hy|ɑntʰɾɑniɡ ɔzɑnjɑn|}} in [[Western Armenian]].

He became active in an armed struggle against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government and Kurdish irregulars in the late 1880s. Andranik joined the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Dashnaktustyun) party and, along with other ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' (militias), sought to defend the Armenian peasantry living in their ancestral homeland, an area known as [[Western Armenia|Western (or Turkish) Armenia]]{{mdash}}at the time part of the Ottoman Empire. His revolutionary activities ceased and he left the Ottoman Empire after the unsuccessful [[1904 Sasun uprising|uprising in Sasun in 1904]]. In 1907, Andranik left Dashnaktustyun because he disapproved of its cooperation with the [[Young Turks]], a party which years later perpetrated the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Between 1912 and 1913, together with [[Garegin Nzhdeh]], Andranik led a few hundred Armenian volunteers within the Bulgarian army against the Ottomans during the [[First Balkan War]].

From the early stages of [[World War I]], Andranik commanded the first [[Armenian volunteer battalion]] within the Russian Imperial army against the Ottoman Empire, capturing and later governing much of the [[Republic of Van|traditional Armenian homeland]]. After the [[Revolution of 1917]], the Russian army retreated and left the Armenian irregulars outnumbered against the Turks. Andranik led the defense of [[Erzurum]] in early 1918, but was forced to retreat eastward. By May 1918, Turkish forces stood near [[Yerevan]]{{mdash}}the future Armenian capital{{mdash}}and were halted at the [[Battle of Sardarabad]]. The Dashnak-dominated [[Armenian National Council (1917—1918)|Armenian National Council]] declared the independence of Armenia and signed the [[Treaty of Batum]] with the Ottoman Empire, by which Armenia gave up its rights to Western Armenia. Andranik never accepted the existence of the [[First Republic of Armenia]] because it included only a small part of the area many Armenians hoped to make independent. Andranik, independently from the Republic of Armenia, fought in [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] against the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijani]] and [[Army of Islam (Ottoman Empire)|Turkish]] armies and helped to keep it within Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panossian|first=Razmik|title=The Armenians: From Kings and Priests to Merchants and Commissars|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-231-51133-9|page=250|authorlink=Razmik Panossian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andranik left Armenia in 1919 due to disagreements with the Armenian government and spent his last years of life in Europe and the United States seeking relief for Armenian refugees. He settled in [[Fresno, California]] in 1922 and died five years later in 1927. Andranik is greatly admired as a [[Folk hero|national hero]] by Armenians; numerous statues of him have been erected in several countries. Streets and squares were named after Andranik, and songs, poems and novels have been written about him, making him a legendary figure in Armenian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghaziyan|first1=Alvard|title=Զորավար Անդրանիկը որպես վիպա-հերոսական կերպար [General Andranik as a heroic character]|date=1984|url=http://iae.asj-oa.am/79/|publisher=Institute of Archeology and Ethnography, [[Armenian National Academy of Sciences]]|location=Yerevan|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Andranik Ozanian was born on 25 February 1865,&lt;ref name=&quot;SAE&quot;/&gt; in [[Şebinkarahisar|Shabin-Karahisar]], [[Sivas Vilayet]], Ottoman Empire{{mdash}}today in Turkey's [[Giresun Province]]{{mdash}}to Mariam and Toros Ozanian.{{sfn|Chalabian|1988|p=3}} [[:wikt:Անդրանիկ|Andranik]] means &quot;firstborn&quot; in Armenian. His paternal ancestors came from the nearby Ozan village in the early 18th century and settled in Shabin-Karahisar to avoid persecution from the Turks.{{sfn|Chalabian|1988|p=3}} His ancestors took the surname Ozanian in honor of their hometown. Andranik's mother died when he was one year old and his elder sister Nazeli took care of him. Andranik went to the local Musheghian School from 1875 to 1882 and thereafter worked in his father's carpentry shop.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=40}} He married at the age of 17, but his wife died a year later while giving birth to their son{{mdash}}who also died days after the birth.{{sfn|Chalabian|1988|p=3}}
[[File:Andranik fedayee.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|An undated photo of Andranik holding a rifle{{efn-ua|The text on flag seen in the background is from the poem ''The Song of the Italian Girl'' by [[Mikael Nalbandian]], which became the [[Mer Hayrenik|Armenian national anthem]] in 1918. The lyrics are from the last stanza: ''Death is the same everywhere/A man dies but once/Blessed is the one that dies/For the freedom of his nation.''}}]]
The situation of the [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]] had worsened under the reign of Abdul Hamid II, who sought to unify all Muslims under his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nalbandian|first=Louise|title=The Armenian Revolutionary Movement: The Development of Armenian Political Parties Through the Nineteenth Century|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-00914-1|page=116|authorlink=Louise Nalbandian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, Andranik was arrested for assaulting a Turkish ''[[Turkish gendarmerie|gendarme]]'' for mistreating Armenians. With the help of his friends, he escaped from prison. He settled in the Ottoman capital [[Constantinople]] in 1884 and stayed there until 1886, working as a carpenter.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=41}} He began his revolutionary activities in 1888 in the province of Sivas.{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=247}}{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}} Andranik joined the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|Hunchak]] party in 1891.{{sfn|Mouradian|1995|p=12}} He was arrested in 1892 for taking part in the assassination of Constantinople's police chief, Yusup Mehmet Bey{{mdash}}known for his [[anti-Armenianism]]{{mdash}}on 9 February.{{sfn|Haroutyunian|1965|p=109}} Andranik once again escaped from prison.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=41}} In 1892, he joined the newly created [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (ARF or Dashnaktsutyun).{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=247}}{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}} During the [[Hamidian massacres]], Andranik with other ''fedayi'' defended the Armenian villages of [[Muş|Mush]] and [[Sasun]] from attacks of the Turks and the Kurdish ''[[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye]]'' units.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}}{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=249}} The massacres, which occurred between 1894 and 1896 and are named after Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], killed between 80,000 and 300,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akçam|first=Taner|title=A shameful act: the Armenian genocide and the question of Turkish responsibility|year=2006|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-7932-7|page=42|authorlink=Taner Akçam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Andranik went to [[Tiflis]]{{mdash}}the largest city of the [[Caucasus]] and a major center of Armenian culture at the time{{mdash}}where the ARF headquarters was located.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}} Andranik returned to Turkish Armenia &quot;entrusted with extensive powers, and with a large supply of arms&quot; for the ''fedayi''.{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=249}} Several dozen Russian Armenians joined him, with whom he went to the Mush-Sasun area where [[Aghbiur Serob]] was operating.{{sfn|New Armenia|1920|p=82}} Serob's forces had already established semi-independent Armenian areas by expelling the Ottoman government representatives.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=178}}

==Leader of the ''fedayi''==
{{see also|Armenian national liberation movement}}
[[File:Armenian monastery of s apostles in moush.jpg|left|265px|thumb|The [[Holy Apostles Monastery]] of Mush]]

Aghbiur Serob, the main leader of the ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' in the 1890s, was killed in 1899 by a Kurdish chieftain, Bushare Khalil Bey.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}} Months later, Bey committed further atrocities against the Armenians by killing a priest, two young men and 25 women and children in Sasun's village of Talvorik.{{sfn|New Armenia|1920|p=82}} Andranik replaced Serob as the head of the Armenian irregular forces &quot;with 38 villages under his command&quot; in the Mush-Sasun region of Western Armenia,{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=178}} where a &quot;warlike semi-independent Armenian peasantry&quot; lived.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}} Andranik sought to kill Bey; he captured and reportedly decapitated the chieftain, and took the medal given to Bey by Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]].{{sfn|New Armenia|1920|p=82}}{{sfn|Mouradian|1995|p=103}}{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=249}} Andranik thus earned an undisputed authority among his ''fedayi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vardanian|first=Mikayel|authorlink=Mikayel Varandian|title=Մուրատ (Սեբաստացի ռազմիկին կյանքն ու գործը) [Murad (The Sebastatsi Fighter's Life and Case]|language=hy|location=Boston|publisher=[[Hairenik Association]]|year=1931|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although small groups of Armenian ''fedayi'' conducted an armed struggle against the Ottoman state and the Kurdish tribes, the situation in [[Western Armenia]] deteriorated as the European powers stood indifferent to the [[Armenian Question]]. Article 61 of the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] intended the Ottoman government to &quot;carry out, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the Circassians and Kurds&quot; remained unimplemented.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212670 Treaty between Great Britain, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Russia, and Turkey for the Settlement of Affairs in the East: Signed at Berlin, July 13, 1878]&quot;, ''[[American Journal of International Law]]'' Volume II, 1908, p. [https://archive.org/stream/jstor-2212670/2212670#page/n21/mode/2up 422]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christopher J. Walker]], the attention of the European powers was on [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], while Russia was &quot;in no mood for reactivating the Armenian question&quot;.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=177}}

===Battle of Holy Apostles Monastery===
[[File:Andranik on a horse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Andranik on his horse, early 1900s]]

In November 1901 the ''fedayi'' clashed with the Ottoman troops in what later became known as the [[Battle of Holy Apostles Monastery]]. One of the best-known episodes of Andranik's revolutionary activities, it was an attempt by the Ottoman government to suppress his activities. Since Andranik had gained more influence over the region, more than 5,000 Turkish soldiers were sent after him and his band. The Turks chased and eventually circled him and his men, numbering around 50, at the [[Arakelots Monastery|Arakelots (Holy Apostles) Monastery]] in early November. A regiment under the command of Ferikh Pasha and Ali Pasha besieged the fort-like monastery. The Turkish generals leading the army of twelve hundred men asked the ''fedayi'' to negotiate their surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ternon|first=Yves|title=The Armenians: history of a genocide|year=1990|publisher=Caravan Books|location=Delmar, New York|isbn=978-0-88206-508-3|page=114|edition=2nd|authorlink=Yves Ternon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After weeks of resistance and negotiations{{mdash}}in which Armenian clergy and the headman of Mush and foreign consuls took part{{mdash}}Andranik and his companions left the monastery and fled in small groups. According to [[Leon Trotsky]], Andranik{{mdash}}dressed in the uniform of a Turkish officer{{mdash}}&quot;went the rounds of the entire guard, talking to them in excellent Turkish&quot;, and &quot;at the same time showing the way out to his own men.&quot;{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}}{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|pp=249-250}} After breaking through the siege of the monastery, Andranik gained legendary stature among provincial Armenians.{{sfn|Adalian|2010|p=79}}{{sfn|Kharatian|1990|p=8}} He became so popular that the men he led came to refer to him always by his first name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chalabian&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chalabian|first=Antranig|authorlink=Antranig Chalabian|title=Bold and fiercely determined, Andranik Ozanian spent most of his life as a revolutionary for his fellow Armenians|journal=[[Military History Monthly]]|volume=12|issue=2|date=June 1995|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andranik intended to attract the attention of the foreign consuls at Mush to the plight of the Armenian peasants and to provide hope for the oppressed Armenians of the eastern provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chalabian&quot;/&gt; According to Trotsky, Andranik's &quot;political thinking took shape in a setting of [[Carbonari]]st activity and diplomatic intrigue.&quot;{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=249}}

===1904 Sasun uprising and exodus===
{{see also|1904 Sasun uprising}}
In 1903, Andranik demanded the Ottoman government stop the harassment of Armenians and implement the reforms in the Armenian provinces.{{sfn|New Armenia|1920|p=83}} Most ''fedayi'' were concentrated in mountainous Sasun, an area of about {{Convert|12,000|sqkm|abbr=on}} with an overwhelming Armenian majority{{mdash}}1,769 Armenian and 155 Kurdish households{{mdash}}which was traditionally considered their main operational area.{{sfn|Hambarian|1989|p=22}} The region was in &quot;a state of revolutionary turmoil&quot; because the local Armenians had refused to pay taxes for the past seven years.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=178}}{{sfn|Chalabian|2009|p=17}} Andranik and tens of other ''fedayi''{{mdash}}including [[Hrayr Dzhoghk|Hrayr]] and [[Sebouh Nersesian|Sebouh]]{{mdash}}held a meeting at Gelieguzan village in the third quarter of 1903 to manage the future defense of the Armenian villages from possible Turkish and Kurdish attacks. Andranik suggested a widespread uprising of the Armenians of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] and [[Vaspurakan]]; Hrayr opposed his view and suggested a small, local uprising in Sasun, because the Armenian irregulars lacked resources. Hrayr's suggestion was eventually approved by the ''fedayi'' meeting. Andranik was chosen as the main commander of the uprising.{{sfn|Hambarian|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Chalabian|2009|p=17}}

[[File:Location of the 1894 and 1904 Sasun uprisings.png|left|thumb|250px|The location of the Sasun uprising ''(orange)'' and the [[Bitlis Vilayet]] ''(yellow)''.]]

The first clashes took place in January 1904 between the ''fedayi'' and Kurdish irregulars supported by the Ottoman government.{{sfn|Hambarian|1989|p=24}} The Turkish offensive started in early April with an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers and 7,000 Kurdish irregulars put against 100 to 200 Armenian ''fedayi'' and 700 to 1,000 local Armenian men.{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=250}}{{sfn|Hambarian|1989|p=26}} Hrayr was killed during the intense fighting; Andranik survived and resumed the fight.{{sfn|Mouradian|1995|p=88}} Between 7,000 and 10,000 Armenian civilians were killed during the two months of the uprising, while about 9,000 were left homeless.{{sfn|Hambarian|1989|p=31}} Around 4,000 Sasun villagers were forced into exile after the uprising.{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=250}}

After weeks of fighting and cannon bombardment of the Armenian villages,{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=250}} the Ottoman forces and Kurdish irregulars suppressed the uprising by May 1904; they outnumbered the Armenian forces several times.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=178}}{{sfn|Hambarian|1989|p=31}} Minor clashes occurred thereafter.{{sfn|Hambarian|1989|p=31}} According to Christopher J.

From Persia, Andranik moved to the Caucasus,{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}} where he met the Armenian leaders in [[Baku]] and Tiflis. He then left Russia and traveled to Europe, where he was engaged in advocacy in support of the Armenians' national liberation struggle.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=41}}{{sfn|New Armenia|1920|p=84}} In 1906 in [[Geneva]], he published a book on military tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;1906 book&quot;/&gt; Most of the work was about his activities and the strategies he used during the 1904 Sasun uprising.{{sfn|Kharatian|1990|p=8}}

In February–March 1907, Andranik went to [[Vienna]] to participate in the fourth ARF Congress. The ARF, which had been associating with Turkish immigrant political groups in Europe since 1902, discussed and approved the negotiations with the [[Young Turks]]{{mdash}}who later perpetrated the [[Armenian Genocide]]{{mdash}}to overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Andranik strongly denounced this cooperation and left the party.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=178}}{{sfn|Chalabian|1988|p=170}} In 1908, the ARF asked Andranik to move to Constantinople and nominate his candidacy in the Ottoman parliament election, but he declined the offer, saying &quot;I don't want to sit there and do nothing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAE&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Haroutyunian|first=A.|editor=[[Viktor Hambardzumyan|Hambardzumyan, Viktor]]|title=[[Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia]]|volume=1|year=1974|publisher=Armenian Encyclopedia Publishing|location=Yerevan|page=392|article=Անդրանիկ [Andranik]|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kharatian|1990|p=10}} Andranik distanced himself from active political and military affairs for several years.

In 1907 Andranik settled in [[Sofia]], where he met the leaders of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]{{mdash}}including revolutionary [[Boris Sarafov]]{{mdash}}and the two pledged to work jointly for the oppressed peoples of Armenia and Macedonia.{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=250}}{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=42}} During the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13), Andranik led a [[Company (military unit)|company]] of 230 Armenian volunteers{{mdash}} part of the [[Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps]] of [[Aleksandar Protogerov]] within the Bulgarian army{{mdash}}against the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}}{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=251}}{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=252}} He shared the command with [[Garegin Nzhdeh]].{{sfn|Trotsky|1980|p=253}} On the opposite side, approximately 8,000 Armenians fought for the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=194}} Andranik was given the rank of a [[first lieutenant]] by the Bulgarian government.{{sfn|New Armenia|1920|p=84}} He distinguished himself in several battles, including in the [[Battle of Merhamli]], when he helped the Bulgarians to capture Turkish commander Yaver Pasha.{{sfn|Chalabian|1988|p=202}}{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=43}} Andranik was honored with the [[Order of Bravery]] by General Protogerov in 1913.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=43}}{{sfn|Chalabian|1988|p=203}} However, Andranik disbanded his men in May 1913,{{sfn|Kharatian|1990|p=11}} and foreseeing the [[Second Balkan War|war between Bulgaria and Serbia]] he &quot;retired to a village near [[Varna]], and lived as a farmer until August 1914&quot;.{{sfn|New Armenia|1920|p=84}}

With the outbreak of [[World War I]] in July 1914 between Russia, France and Britain on one side and Germany, the Ottoman Empire and Austria on the other, Andranik left Bulgaria for Russia.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}} He was appointed the commander of the first [[Armenian volunteer battalion]] by the Russian government. From November 1914 to August 1915, Andranik took part in the [[Caucasus Campaign]] as the head commander of the first Armenian battalion of about 1,200 volunteers within the [[Imperial Russian Army]].{{sfn|Chalabian|2009|p=45}}{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=43}} Andranik's battalion particularly stood out at the [[Battle of Dilman]] in April 1915.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}} By the victory at Dilman, the Russian and Armenian forces under the command of General [[Tovmas Nazarbekian|Nazarbekian]], effectively stopped the Turks from invading the Caucasus via [[Iranian Azerbaijan]].{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=43}}{{sfn|Payaslian|2007|p=136}}

Through 1915, the Armenian Genocide was underway in the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Payaslian|2007|p=136}} By the end of the war, virtually all Armenians living in their ancestral homeland were either dead or forced into exile by the Ottoman government. An estimated 1.5 million Armenians died in the process, ending two thousand years  of Armenian presence in [[Western Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diaspora and Memory: Figures of Displacement in Contemporary Literature, Arts and Politics|year=2007|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-2129-7|page=174|author1=Marie-Aude Baronian |author2=Stephan Besser |author3=Yolande Jansen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shirinian|first=Lorne|title=The Republic of Armenia and the rethinking of the North-American Diaspora in literature|year=1992|publisher=E.

Chernozubov]], the successes of Russian army in numerous locations were significantly associated with the fighting of the first Armenian battalion, headed by Andranik. Chernozubov praised Andranik as a brave and experienced chief, who well understood the combat situation; Chernozubov described him as always at the head of militia, enjoying great prestige among the volunteers.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=45}}

The situation drastically changed in 1916 when the Russian government ordered the Armenian volunteer units to be demobilized and prohibited any Armenian civic activity.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=14}} Andranik resigned as the commander of the first Armenian battalion.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=44}} Despite the earlier Russian promises, their plan for the region was to make Western Armenia an integral part of Russia and &quot;possibly repopulate by Russian peasants and [[Cossacks]]&quot;.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|pp=14–15}} [[Richard Hovannisian]] wrote that because the &quot;Russian armies were in firm control of most of the Armenian plateau by the summer of 1916, there was no longer any need to expend niceties upon the Armenians&quot;.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=15}} According to Tsatur Aghayan, Russia used the Armenian volunteers for its own interests.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=44}} Andranik and other Armenian volunteers, disappointed by the Russian policy, left the front in July 1916.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=44}}

===Russian Revolution and Turkish reoccupation===

The [[February Revolution]] was positively accepted by the Armenians because it ended the autocratic rule of [[Nicholas II]].{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=45}} The [[Special Transcaucasian Committee]] (known as OZAKOM) was set up in the [[South Caucasus]] by the [[Russian Provisional Government]].{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=15}} In April 1917, Andranik initiated the publication of the newspaper ''[[Hayastan Daily|Hayastan]]'' (Armenia) in Tiflis.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=45}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nichanian|first=Marc|title=Writers of Disaster: Armenian Literature in the Twentieth Century|volume=1|year=2002|publisher=Gomidas Institute|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-1-903656-09-9|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vahan Totovents]] became the editor of this non-partisan, Ottoman Armenian-orientated newspaper.{{sfn|Kharatian|1990|p=12}} Until December 1917, Andranik remained in the South Caucasus where he sought to help the Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire in their search for basic needs.{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=44}} The provisional government decree of 9 May 1917 put Turkish Armenia under civil administration, with Armenians holding key positions. About 150,000 local Armenians began to rebuild devastated Turkish Armenia; however the Russian army units gradually disintegrated and many soldiers deserted and returned to Russia.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=15}}

After the 1917 [[October Revolution]], the chaotic retreat of Russian troops from Western Armenia escalated.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=20}} [[Bolshevik Russia]] and the Ottoman Empire signed the [[Armistice of Erzincan]] on 5 December 1917, ending the hostilities. The [[Sovnarkom|Soviet Russian government]] formally acknowledged the right of self-determination of the Ottoman Armenians in January 1918, but on 3 March 1918, Russia signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with the [[Central Powers]], ceding Western Armenia and large areas in Eastern Europe to concentrate its forces against the [[White movement|Whites]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=21}}

In December 1917, because the Russian divisions were deserting the region ''en masse'', the Russian command authorized the formation of the Armenian Army Corps under the [[Transcaucasian Commissariat]]. Under the command of [[Tovmas Nazarbekian|General Nazarbekian]], the Corps was positioned in the front line from Van to [[Erzincan]]{{mdash}}a city of around about 20,000 people. Two of the Corps' three divisions were made up of Russian Armenians, while Andranik commanded the Turkish (Western) Armenian division.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=250}} The Georgian forces patrolled the area between Erzincan and the [[Black Sea]]. Hovannisian states that the only &quot;several thousand men now defended a 300-mile front formerly secured by a half million Russian regulars&quot;.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=22}} Since December 1917, Andranik commanded the Armenian forces in [[Erzurum]].

While the Transcaucasian delegation and the Turks were holding a [[Trebizond Peace Conference|conference in Trebizond]], through March and April the Turkish forces, according to Walker, &quot;overran the temporary establishment of Armenian rule in Turkish Armenia, extinguishing the hope so recently raised&quot;.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=250}} Hovannisian wrote, &quot;the battle for Turkish Armenia had been quickly decided; the struggle for Russian Armenia was now at hand&quot;.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=24}} After the Turks captured Erzurum, the largest city in Turkish Armenia, Andranik retreated through [[Kars]], passed through [[Alexandropol]] and [[Stepanavan|Jalaloghly]], and arrived in [[Dsegh]] by 18 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAE&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=46}} By early April 1918, the Turkish forces had reached the pre-war international borders.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=24}} Andranik and his unit in Dsegh were not able to take part in the battles of [[Battle of Sardarabad|Sardarabad]], [[Battle of Abaran|Abaran]] and [[Battle of Karakilisa|Karakilisa]].{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=46}}

==First Republic of Armenia==
[[File:Armenia delegation United States 1919.jpg|300px|thumb|Republic of Armenia delegation to the United States. Andranik is second from the bottom right.]]
Since the Ottoman forces were effectively stopped at Sardarabad, the Armenian National Council declared the independence of the [[Russian Armenia]]n lands on 28 May 1918. Andranik condemned this move and denounced the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=256}} Angry with the Dashnaks, he favored good relations with Bolshevik Russia instead.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=411}}{{sfn|Aghayan|1968|p=46}} Andranik refused to acknowledge the Republic of Armenia because according to the [[Treaty of Batum]] it &quot;was only a dusty province without Turkish Armenia whose salvation Armenians had been seeking for 40 years.&quot;{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=87}}{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=272-273}} In early June, Andranik departed from [[Dilijan]] with thousands of refugees; they traveled through [[Sevan, Armenia|Yelenovka]], [[Nor Bayazet]] and [[Vayots Dzor|Daralagyaz]], and arrived in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]] on 17 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAE&quot;/&gt; He subsequently tried to help the Armenian refugees from Van at [[Khoy]], Iran.

===Zangezur===
[[File:Andranik Zangezur 1918.png|300px|thumb|Andranik with the commanders of the Special Striking Division in Zangezur, 1918]]

As the Turkish forces moved towards Nakhichevan, Andranik with his Armenian Special Striking Division moved to the mountainous region of [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] to set up a defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAE&quot;/&gt; By mid-1918, the relations between the Armenians and Azeris in Zangezur had deteriorated.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=86}} Andranik arrived in Zangezur at a critical moment with around 30,000 refugees and an estimated force of between 3,000 and 5,000 men. He established effective control of the region by September. The role of Zangezur was crucial because it was a connection point between Turkey and Azerbaijan. Under Andranik, the region became one of the last centers of Armenian resistance after the Treaty of Batum.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=87}}

Andranik's irregulars remained in Zangezur surrounded by Muslim villages that controlled the key routes connecting the different parts of Zangezur.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=87}} According to [[Donald Bloxham]], Andranik initiated the change of Zangezur into a solidly Armenian land by destroying Muslim villages and trying to ethnically homogenize key areas of the Armenian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloxham|first=Donald|title=The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-927356-0|pages=103–105|authorlink=Donald Bloxham}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1918, Azerbaijan accused Andranik of killing innocent Azerbaijani peasants in Zangezur and demanded that he withdraw Armenian units from the area. [[Antranig Chalabian]] wrote that, &quot;Without the presence of General Andranik and his Special Striking Division, what is now the Zangezur district of Armenia would be party of Azerbaijan today. Without General Andranik and his men, only a miracle could have saved the sixty thousand Armenian inhabitants of the Zangezur district from complete annihilation by the Turko-Tatar forces in the fall of 1918&quot;;{{sfn|Chalabian|2009|p=409}} he further stated that Andranik &quot;did not massacre peaceful Tatars&quot;.{{sfn|Chalabian|2009|p=545}} Andranik's activities in Zangezur were protested by Ottoman general [[Halil Pasha]], who threatened the Dashnak government with retaliation for Andranik's actions. Armenia's Prime Minister [[Hovhannes Katchaznouni]] said he had no control over Andranik and his forces.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|pp=87-88}}

===Karabakh===
[[File:Andranik Military Council of Goris 1918.png|left|300px|thumb|Andranik with the Military Council of Goris, 1918]]
The Ottoman Empire was officially defeated in the First World War and the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October 1918. The Ottoman forces evacuated Karabakh in November 1918 and by the end of October of that year, Andranik's forces were concentrated between Zangezur and [[Karabakh]]. Before moving towards Karabakh, Andranik made sure that the local Armenians would support him in fighting the Azeris. In mid-November 1918, he received letters from Karabakh Armenian officials asking him to postpone the offensive for 10 days ton allow negotiations with the Muslims of the region. According to Hovannisian, &quot;the time lost proved crucial&quot;. In late November, Andranik's forces headed towards [[Shusha]]{{mdash}}the main city of Karabakh and a major Armenian cultural center. After an intense fight against the Kurds, his forces broke through [[Lachin|Abdallyar]] and the surrounding villages.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|pp=88-89}}

By early December, Andranik was {{Convert|40|km|miles|abbr=on}} away from Shusha when he received a message from British General W. M. Thomson in Baku, suggesting that he retreat from Karabakh because the World War was over and any further Armenian military activity would adversely affect the solution of the Armenian question, which was soon to be considered by the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|peace conference in Paris]].{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=89-90}} Trusting the British, Andranik returned to Zangezur.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=270}}

The region was left under limited control of the Armenian [[Karabakh Council]]. The British mission under command of Thomson arrived in Karabakh in December 1918. Thomson insisted the council &quot;act only in local, nonpolitical matters&quot;, which sparked discontent among the Armenians.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=89-90}} An &quot;ardent [[pan-Turkist]]&quot; [[Khosrov bey Sultanov]] was soon appointed the governor of Karabakh and Zangezur by Thomson to &quot;squash any unrest in the region&quot;.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=270}} Christopher J. Walker wrote that &quot;[Karabakh] with its large Armenian majority remained Azerbaijani throughout the pre-Soviet and Soviet period&quot; because of &quot;Andranik's trust of the word of a British officer&quot;.{{sfn|Walker|1990|pp=270-272}}

=== Departure ===
[[File:Andranik 1919.png|thumb|left|260px|Andranik with his men and two archbishops in [[Etchmiadzin]] just before leaving Armenia, April 1919]]
During the winter of 1918–19, Zangezur was isolated from Karabakh and Yerevan by snow. The refugees intensified the famine and epidemic conditions and gave way to inflation. In December 1918, Andranik withdrew from Karabakh to [[Goris]]. On his way, he met with British officers who suggested the Armenian units stay in Zangezur for the winter. Andranik agreed to such a proposal and on 23 December 1918, a group of Armenian leaders met in a conference and concluded that Zangezur could not cope with the influx of refugees until spring.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=189}} They agreed that the first logical step in relieving the tension was the reparation of  more than 15,000 refugees from Nakhichevan{{mdash}}the adjoining district that had been evacuated by the Ottoman armies.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=190}} Andranik and the conference called upon the British to provide for the refugees in the interim. Major W. D. Gibbon arrived with limited supplies and money donated by the [[Armenians in Baku|Armenians of Baku]], but this was not enough to support the refugees.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=193}}
[[File:Andranik Ozanian, Hovhannes Tumanyan.jpg|right|190px|thumb|Andranik Ozanian and [[Hovhannes Tumanyan]] in Tiflis]]
At the end of February 1919, Andranik was ready to leave Zangezur. Gibbon suggested Andranik and his soldiers leave by Baku-Tiflis railway at [[Yevlakh]] station. Andranik rejected this plan and on 22 March 1919, he left Goris and traveled across [[Sisian]] through deep snowdrifts to Daralagyaz, then moved to the [[Ararat plain]] with his few thousand irregulars.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=190}} After a three-week march, his men and horses reached the railway station of [[Ararat, Armenia|Davalu]]. He was met by [[Drastamat Kanayan|Dro]], the Assistant Minister of Military Affairs and Sargis Manasian, the Assistant Minister of Internal Affairs, who offered to take him to visit Yerevan, but he rejected their invitation as he believed the Dashnak government had betrayed the Armenians and was responsible for the loss of his homeland and the annihilation of his people. Zangezur became more vulnerable to Azerbaijani threats after Andranik left the district. Earlier, before Andranik's and his soldiers' dismissal, the local Armenian forces had requested support from Yerevan.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1971|p=193}}

On 13 April 1919, Andranik reached [[Etchmiadzin]], the seat of [[Catholicos of All Armenians]] and the religious center of the Armenians, who helped the troops prepare for disbanding.{{sfn|Blackwood's|1919|p=476}} His 5,000-strong division had dwindled to 1,350 soldiers.{{sfn|Chalabian|2009|p=119}} As a result of Andranik's disagreements with the Dashnak government and the diplomatic machinations of the British in the Caucasus, Andranik disbanded his division and handed his belongings and weapons to the Catholicos [[George V of Armenia|George V]].{{sfn|Chalabian|2009|pp=119-120}} On 27 April 1919, he left Etchmiadzin accompanied by 15 officers, and went to Tiflis on a special train; according to Blackwood, &quot;news of his journey traveled before him. At every station crowds were waiting to get a glimpse of their national hero.&quot;{{sfn|Blackwood's|1919|p=476}} He left Armenia for the last time; in Tiflis he met with Georgia's Foreign Minister [[Evgeni Gegechkori]] and discussed the [[Georgian–Armenian War]] with translation of [[Hovhannes Tumanyan]].{{sfn|Chalabian|2009|pp=119-120}}
