The '''Kawasaki C-2''' (previously '''XC-2''' and '''C-X''') is a mid-size, twin-[[Turbofan|turbofan engine]], long range, high speed [[military transport aircraft]] developed and manufactured by [[Kawasaki Aerospace Company]]. In March 2016, the C-2 formally entered service with the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.go.jp/j/news/2010/01/25d.html &quot;次期輸送機試作１号機の初飛行について.&quot;] ''[[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Ministry of Defense]]'', 25 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
After researching foreign aircraft such as the [[C-130J Super Hercules]], [[C-17 Globemaster III]], and [[Airbus A400M]], the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Defense]] concluded that there was no aircraft currently in production that possessed the capabilities that the JASDF required. In response to this need, the Japanese MOD commenced the production of plans to develop an indigenously designed and manufactured transport aircraft. In 1995, Kawasaki appealed to the [[Japanese Defense Agency]] (JDA) to issue funding for the development of a domestically-built C-X transport aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul. [https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/kawasaki-presses-jda-for-transport-launch-cash-22442/ &quot;Kawasaki presses JDA for transport-launch cash.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 18 January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the JDA began forming its requirement for the replacement military airlifer; early determinations for the proposed project included that it would be powered by [[turbofan]] engines, possess the range to reach [[Hawaii]] from Japan, and carry double the payload of the C-130.&lt;ref&gt;Jeziorski, Andrzej. [https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/japanese-fine-tune-military-transport-requirement-63731/ &quot;Japanese fine tune military transport requirement.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 28 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, the MOD formally issued a [[request for proposals]] in regards to the new transport aircraft, referred to as the C-X program; at the time, the MOD planned to procure 40 aircraft to replace its aging [[Kawasaki C-1]] and [[C-130 Hercules]] fleets.&lt;ref name=&quot;平成２１年度ライフサイクルコスト管理年次報告書.&quot;&gt;[http://image02w.seesaawiki.jp/l/n/live_doraemon/cdc38a6728c32e73.pdf &quot;平成２１年度ライフサイクルコスト管理年次報告書.&quot;] ''Equipment Procurement and Construction Office''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Andrew.

Kawasaki developed the C-X in parallel with the ''[[Kawasaki P-1|P-X]]'', which it had also been selected to develop. As a cost saving measure, major airframe parts and system components were shared between the two aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Jeziorski, Andrzej. [https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/japan-unveils-plan-to-develop-transport-and-maritime-123266/ &quot;Japan unveils plan to develop transport and maritime aircraft.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 28 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; They use the same basic wing structure, although it is installed at different [[wing sweep|sweep angle]] and dihedral on the two versions, with different high lift devices and powerplant attachments. Common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the [[auxiliary power unit]], cockpit panel, flight control system computer, anti-collision lights, and gear control unit.&lt;ref name = &quot;skyhigh&quot;/&gt; As of 2007, the total development cost for the two aircraft has been 345 billion [[yen]] (or roughly equal to $2.9 billion), which is low compared to similar programs. As an example: the development contract for the [[P-8 Poseidon]] alone was $3.89 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3a49835293-e38b-4ebb-9a0b-c463eddc7b67&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest] ''Aviation Week Ares Blog'', 27 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boeing_20040514&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2004/q2/nr_040614n.html &quot;Boeing Team Wins $3.89 Billion Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft Program.&quot;] ''[[Boeing]]'', 14 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several powerplants were considered for the C-X, including the [[Rolls-Royce Trent|Rolls-Royce Trent 800]], the [[General Electric CF6|General Electric CF6-80C2L1F]] and the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Andrew.

[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/ihi-backs-ges-cf6-engine-proposal-165985/ &quot;IHI backs GE's CF6 engine proposal.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 27 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the CF6-80C2L1F was selected to power the type. In August 2003, it was announced that the C-X project had passed a preliminary JDA design review, allowing for prototype manufacturing to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;Sobie, Brendan.

During the construction of the first prototype, there was a problem discovered with some American-made rivets which delayed the roll-out to 4 July 2007 along with its cousin aircraft [[Kawasaki P-1|P-X]] (since designated as the P-1).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/production-fault-hits-kawasaki-transport-and-mpa-pro-212042/ &quot;Production fault hits Kawasaki transport and MPA projects.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 13 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; During structural testing, deformation of the XP-1 / XC-2 horizontal stabiliser was found, as well as cracking in the XC-2 undercarriage trunnion structure and parts of the fuselage; the cracking problem was reportedly difficult to address.&lt;ref name = &quot;kawa civ&quot;/&gt; The C-X program was embroiled in further controversy when allegations that [[bribe]]ry had been involved in the purchase of five [[General Electric CF6|General Electric CF6-80C2]] engines, used to power the aircraft, were made by prosecutors.&lt;ref name = &quot;kawa civ&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, according to the ''[[Chunichi Shimbun]]'', the C-2 was set to cost about 10 billion yen per aircraft (about US$80 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chunichi.co.jp/hold/2008/ntok0011/list/200711/CK2007111002063769.html &quot;中日新聞:＜蜜月の終焉＞　ミライズに固執:防衛利権　蜜月の構図.&quot;], ''[[Chunichi Shimbun]]'', 10 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Postponement of the F-X program and the need to increase funding of the [[Mitsubishi F-15J|F-15J]] fleet modernisation program have necessitated the implementation of a one-year delay in the C-X program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.go.jp/j/news/2010/01/25d.html] ''Japanese Ministry of Defence'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.go.jp/j/news/2010/01/26a.html] ''Japanese Ministry of Defence'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the aircraft was delayed again following the failure of the rear cargo door during pressure tests. The delay will increase the program cost by 40 billion yen ($390 million) to 260 billion yen in addition to delays to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kubo |first1=Nobuhiro |title=Japan again delays C-2 cargo plane, could hamper overseas push |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/07/04/japan-defense-delay-idINL4N0PF1UN20140704|accessdate=7 July 2014 |work=Reuters |issue=Online |publisher=Reuters |date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;E&amp;T 2014&quot;/&gt; In March 2016, it was reported that the C-2 program faced delays of five years from its initial schedule due to technical problems, while development costs were then estimated to hit ¥264.3 billion, ¥80 billion more than initially projected.&lt;ref name = &quot;times 2016&quot;/&gt;

Kawasaki has also studied the development of a civil-orientated version of the C-2 with ambitions to sell the type to commercial operators. This variant, tentatively designated as the YC-X, little modification is envisioned from the C-2, making use of transferrable technologies from the military airlifter, although the intended payload is likely to be increased from the C-2's 26-ton maximum to 37-tons.&lt;ref name = &quot;kawa civ&quot;&gt;Govindasamy, Siva. [https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/kawasaki-talks-civil-316324/ &quot;Kawasaki talks civil.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 23 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, it was stated that the development of a civilian derivative of the C-2 has been given a lower priority than the completion of the military airlifter.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, Leithen. [https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/japan-to-make-commercial-cargo-aircraft-215332/ &quot;Japan to make commercial cargo aircraft.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 4 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2012, Kawasaki was in the process of consulting potential customers on the topic of the YC-X for transporting [[outsize cargo]]; based upon customer feedback, Kawasaki forecast an estimated demand for up to 100 freighters capable of handling bulky cargoes between 2020 and 2030.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, Greg.

The Kawasaki C-2 is a long range twin-engine transport aircraft. In comparison with the older C-1 that it replaces, the C-2 can carry payloads up to four times heavier, such as [[MIM-104 Patriot]] [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) batteries and [[Mitsubishi H-60]] helicopters, and possesses six times the range.&lt;ref name = &quot;E&amp;T 2014&quot;&gt;Pultarova, Tereza.
