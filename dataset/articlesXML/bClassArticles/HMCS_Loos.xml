'''HMCS ''Loos''''' was one of twelve {{sclass2-|Battle|trawler|0}} [[naval trawler]]s used by the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN). Built by the [[Kingston Shipbuilding Company]] and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] in September 1917, she was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in August 1918. Decommissioned in 1920, ''Loos'' was transferred to the [[Department of Marine and Fisheries (Canada)|Department of Marine and Fisheries]], where she was used as a lighthouse supply ship. Sold in 1937, she was re-acquired by the RCN in December 1940 and converted to a gate vessel, spending part of the war at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], [[Nova Scotia]]. Returned to [[Marine Industries Limited]] in 1945, ''Loos'' was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1949.

==Design and description==

The RCN's Battle-class trawlers formed part of the Canadian naval response to [[Admiralty]] warnings to Canada about the growing German [[U-boat]] [[Atlantic U-boat Campaign (World War I)|threat to merchant shipping]] in the western Atlantic.&lt;ref name=tucker253&gt;Tucker, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, these ships were modelled on contemporary British [[North Sea]] trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 254, 257&lt;/ref&gt; 

Twelve vessels were ordered on 2 February 1917 from two shipyards, [[Polson Iron Works Limited|Polson Iron Works]] of [[Toronto]] and [[Canadian Vickers]] of [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name=johnston417&gt;Johnston et al., p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; Two of those contracts awarded to Canadian Vickers were subcontracted to Kingston Shipbuilding of [[Kingston, Ontario]]. Those vessels retained the same design as those built in Montreal.&lt;ref name=johnston484&gt;Johnston et al., p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; Those ships constructed using the Canadian Vickers design [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|357|LT|t|lk=in}} and were {{convert|130|ft|m}} [[Length overall|long overall]] with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|25|ft|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|13|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=mac27&gt;Macpherson and Barrie, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were propelled by a steam-powered [[triple expansion]] engine driving one shaft creating {{convert|480|ihp|lk=in}} giving the vessels a maximum speed of {{convert|10|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=johnston417/&gt;&lt;ref name=maginley67&gt;Maginley and Collin, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

All twelve trawlers were equipped with a [[Quick-firing gun|QF]] [[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun]] mounted forward.&lt;ref name=mac27/&gt;{{efn|name=gun nomenclature}} This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of [[depth charge]]s.&lt;ref name=tucker253/&gt;&lt;ref name=tucker257&gt;Tucker, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The trawlers were named after battles of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel.&lt;ref name=johnston417/&gt;{{efn|name=inflation}}{{efn|name=cost}}

==Service history==
Named after the [[Battle of Loos]], the ship was constructed by Kingston Shipbuilding at Kingston, Ontario and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 September 1917.&lt;ref name=mac29&gt;Macpherson and Barrie, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston et al., pp. 481-84&lt;/ref&gt; The six vessels ordered from Canadian Vickers were delayed further by difficulty in providing engines for the trawlers. The hulls had been finished during Summer 1917. However, the engines did not arrive until the fall.&lt;ref name=johnston484/&gt; ''Loos'' was 
commissioned on 1 August 1918.&lt;ref name=mac29/&gt;

''Loos'' sailed to the east coast where for the 1918 shipping season, all the Battle-class trawlers were assigned to patrol and escort duties based out of [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston et al., pp. 543, 645&lt;/ref&gt; The trawler performed these duties until the end of the war, and remained in service until 1920, when she was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] by the RCN.&lt;ref name=mac29/&gt; The Department of Marine and Fisheries took over the vessel and converted ''Loos'' to a lighthouse supply and buoy vessel in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Maginley and Collin, pp. 67, 113&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, the vessel was sold out of government service to Marine Industries.&lt;ref name=mac29/&gt;&lt;ref name=miramar&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=1141344|shipname=Loos |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the RCN reacquired the vessel on 12 December 1940. The former trawler was converted to a [[gate vessel]] and re-designated ''Gate Vessel 14'' and deployed at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=mac29/&gt; Following the war, the ship was returned to Marine Industries and broken up in 1949.&lt;ref name=mac29/&gt;&lt;ref name=maginley67/&gt;
