'''George Stanley McGovern''' (July 19, 1922&amp;nbsp;– October 21, 2012) was an American historian, author, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]], [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]].

McGovern grew up in [[Mitchell, South Dakota]], where he was a renowned debater. He volunteered for the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Army Air Forces]] upon the country's entry into [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and as a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] pilot flew 35&amp;nbsp;missions over [[German-occupied Europe]]. Among the medals bestowed upon him was a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for making a hazardous emergency landing of his damaged plane and saving his crew. After the war he gained degrees from [[Dakota Wesleyan University]] and [[Northwestern University]], culminating in a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], and was a history professor. He was elected to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;House of Representatives in 1956 and re-elected in 1958. After a failed bid for the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Senate in 1960, he was a successful candidate in 1962.

As a senator, McGovern was an exemplar of [[modern American liberalism]]. He became most known for his outspoken opposition to the growing U.S.&amp;nbsp;involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. He staged a brief nomination run in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]] as a stand-in for the assassinated [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. The subsequent [[McGovern–Fraser Commission]] fundamentally altered the presidential nominating process, by greatly increasing the number of [[caucus]]es and [[primary election|primaries]] and reducing the influence of party insiders. The [[McGovern–Hatfield Amendment]] sought to end the Vietnam War by legislative means but was defeated in 1970 and 1971. McGovern's long-shot, grassroots-based [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|1972 presidential campaign]] found triumph in gaining the Democratic nomination but left the party badly split ideologically, and the failed vice-presidential pick of [[Thomas Eagleton]] undermined McGovern's credibility. In the general election McGovern lost to incumbent [[Richard Nixon]] in one of the biggest [[Landslide victory|landslide]]s in American electoral history. Re-elected Senator in 1968 and 1974, McGovern was defeated in a bid for a fourth term in 1980.

Throughout his career, McGovern was involved in issues related to agriculture, food, nutrition, and hunger. As the first director of the [[Food for Peace]] program in 1961, McGovern oversaw the distribution of U.S. surpluses to the needy abroad and was instrumental in the creation of the [[United Nations]]-run [[World Food Programme]]. As sole chair of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs|Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]] from 1968 to 1977, McGovern publicized the problem of hunger within the United States and issued the &quot;McGovern Report&quot;, which led to a new set of nutritional guidelines for Americans. McGovern later served as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture|U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture]] from 1998 to 2001 and was appointed the first UN Global Ambassador on World Hunger by the World Food Programme in 2001. The [[McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program]] has provided school meals for millions of children in dozens of countries since 2000 and resulted in McGovern's being named [[World Food Prize]] co‑laureate in 2008.

==Early years and early education==
McGovern was born in the 600‑person farming community of [[Avon, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-265&quot;&gt;''Current Year Biography 1967'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-66&quot;/&gt; His father, Rev.

When George was about three years old, the family moved to Calgary for a while to be near Frances' ailing mother, and he formed memories of events such as the [[Calgary Stampede]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc-sun-ed&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/thesundayedition/ | title=George McGovern interview | last = Sylvestor | first = Kevin | work=[[The Sunday Edition (CBC Radio)|The Sunday Edition]] | publisher=[[CBC Radio One]] | date = July 26, 2009 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6BgOgM12X | archivedate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; When George was six, the family returned to the United States and moved to [[Mitchell, South Dakota]], a community of 12,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-66&quot;/&gt; McGovern attended public schools there&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-265&quot;/&gt; and was an average student.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-30&quot;/&gt; He was painfully shy as a child and was afraid to speak in class during first grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;airjourn&quot;/&gt; His only reproachable behavior was going to see movies, which were among the worldly amusements forbidden to good Wesleyan Methodists.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-30&quot;/&gt; Otherwise he had a normal childhood marked by visits to the renowned Mitchell [[Corn Palace]]&lt;ref name=&quot;airjourn&quot;/&gt; and what he later termed &quot;a sense of belonging to a particular place and knowing your part in it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-72&quot;/&gt; He would, however, long remember the [[Dust Bowl]] storms and [[Locust|grasshopper plagues]] that swept the [[Great Plains|prairie states]] during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, ''The Third Freedom'', pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The McGovern family lived on the edge of the [[poverty line]] for much of the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up amid that lack of affluence gave young George a lifelong sympathy for underpaid workers and struggling farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-66&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0714FA3855107A93C2AA178CD85F428685F9 |title= Man in the News: George Stanley McGovern: Senatorial Price Critic |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 30, 1966 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced by the currents of populism and agrarian unrest and by the &quot;practical divinity&quot; teachings of cleric [[John Wesley]] that sought to fight poverty, injustice, and ignorance.&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-292&quot;&gt;Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', pp. 292–293.&lt;/ref&gt;

McGovern attended [[Mitchell High School (South Dakota)|Mitchell High School]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-265&quot;/&gt; where he was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-31&quot;/&gt; A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active.&lt;ref name=&quot;airjourn&quot;/&gt; His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-27&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 27–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knock, &quot;Come Home America&quot;, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. McGovern, ''Uphill'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-27&quot;/&gt; He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-265&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-33&quot;/&gt;

McGovern enrolled at small [[Dakota Wesleyan University]] in Mitchell&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-265&quot;/&gt; and became a star student there.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-46&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He supplemented a forensic scholarship by working a variety of odd jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-33&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; With World War II underway overseas and feeling insecure about his own courage,{{refn|In the seventh grade, a gym teacher had called McGovern a &quot;physical coward&quot; for being afraid to dive headfirst and somersault over a gymnastics [[vaulting horse]]; the incident had troubled McGovern psychologically and part of his motivation in taking up flying was to prove himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-31&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} McGovern took flying lessons in an [[Aeronca Aircraft|Aeronca aircraft]] and received a pilot's license through the government's [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;airjourn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-31&quot;/&gt; McGovern recalled: &quot;Frankly, I was scared to death on that first solo flight.

McGovern was listening to a radio broadcast of the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] for a sophomore-year music appreciation class when he heard the news of the December 7, 1941, [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-42&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1942 he drove with nine other students to [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and volunteered to join the [[United States Army Air Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;Knock, ''The Rise of a Prairie Statesman'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The military accepted him, but they did not yet have enough airfields, aircraft, or instructors to start training all the volunteers, so McGovern stayed at Dakota Wesleyan.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-45&quot;/&gt; George and Eleanor became engaged, but initially decided not to marry until the war was over.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-45&quot;/&gt; During his sophomore year, McGovern won the statewide intercollegiate South Dakota Peace Oratory Contest with a speech called &quot;My Brother's Keeper&quot;, which was later selected by the [[National Council of Churches]] as one of the nation's twelve best orations of 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-61&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Smart, handsome, and well-liked, McGovern was elected president of his sophomore class and voted &quot;Glamour Boy&quot; during his junior year.&lt;ref name=&quot;knock-cha-87&quot;/&gt; In February 1943, during his junior year, he and a partner won a regional debate tournament at [[North Dakota State University]] that featured competitors from thirty-two schools across a dozen states; upon his return to campus, he discovered that the Army had finally called him up.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-46&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;knock-cha-87&quot;&gt;Knock, &quot;Come Home America&quot;, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
Soon thereafter McGovern was sworn in as a [[Private (rank)|private]] at [[Fort Snelling]] in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-49&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent a month at [[Jefferson Barracks Military Post]] in [[Missouri]] and then five months at [[Southern Illinois Normal University]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois]], for ground school training; McGovern later maintained that both the academic work and physical training were the toughest he ever experienced.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-56&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 54, 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent two months at a base in [[San Antonio, Texas]], and then went to [[Hatbox Field]] in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], for basic flying school, training in a single-engined [[PT-19|PT‑19]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-56&quot;/&gt; McGovern married Eleanor Stegeberg on October 31, 1943 during a three-day leave (lonely and in love, the couple had decided to not wait any longer); his father presided over the ceremony at the small Methodist church in Woonsocket.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-65&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;terry-43&quot;&gt;McGovern, ''Terry'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; After three months in Muskogee, McGovern went to [[Coffeyville Army Airfield]] in [[Kansas]] for a further three months of training on the [[BT-13|BT‑13]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-68&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 68–70, 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Around April 1944, McGovern went on to advanced flying school at [[Pampa Army Airfield]] in [[Texas]] for twin-engine training on the [[Cessna AT-17|AT‑17]] and [[Curtiss AT-9|AT‑9]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-68&quot;/&gt; Throughout, Air Cadet McGovern showed skill as a pilot, with his exceptionally good [[depth perception]] aiding him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-56&quot;/&gt; Eleanor McGovern followed him to these different duty stations, and was present when he received his wings and was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|Second Lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-68&quot;/&gt;

McGovern was assigned to [[Liberal Army Airfield]] in Kansas and its transition school to learn to fly the B‑24 Liberator, an assignment he was pleased with.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-68&quot;/&gt; McGovern recalled later: &quot;Learning how to fly the B‑24 was the toughest part of the training. It was a difficult airplane to fly, physically, because in the early part of the war, they didn't have hydraulic controls.

In September 1944, McGovern joined the 741st Squadron of the [[455th Bombardment Group]] of the [[Fifteenth Air Force]], stationed at [[San Giovanni Airfield]] near [[Cerignola]] in the [[Apulia]] region of Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-124&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 124, 128–130.&lt;/ref&gt; There he and his crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything they had seen back home during the Depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-124&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-prof-1968&quot;/&gt; Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger.&lt;ref name=&quot;staug&quot;/&gt; Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35&amp;nbsp;missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the ''Dakota Queen'' after his wife Eleanor.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; His targets were in [[Austria]]; [[Czechoslovakia]]; Germany; [[Hungary]]; [[Poland]]; and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either [[oil refinery]] complexes or rail [[marshalling yard]]s, all as part of the [[Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|U.S.&amp;nbsp;strategic bombing campaign in Europe]]. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared to earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy [[anti-aircraft artillery]] fire that filled the sky with flak bursts.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

On McGovern's December 15 mission over [[Linz]], his second as pilot, a piece of shrapnel from flak came through the windshield and missed fatally wounding him by only a few inches.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day on a mission to [[Brüx]], he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt; On a December 20 mission against the [[Škoda Works]] at [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], Czechoslovakia, McGovern's plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on [[Vis (island)|Vis]], a small island in the [[Adriatic Sea]] off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Partisan (military)|Partisans]]. The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft that many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished. But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (USA)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-192&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 192–196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1000-176&quot;&gt;Schlesinger, ''A Thousand Days'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1945, McGovern used [[R&amp;R (military)|R&amp;R]] time to see every sight that he could in Rome, and to participate in an [[audience with the Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 202–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Bad weather prevented many missions from being carried out during the winter, and during such downtime McGovern spent much time reading and discussing how the war had come about. He resolved that if he survived it, he would become a history professor.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 186, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; In February, McGovern was promoted to [[First Lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 14, McGovern had an incident over Austria in which he accidentally bombed a family farmhouse when a jammed bomb improvidentally released above the structure and destroyed it, an event which haunted McGovern.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-228&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 228–233.&lt;/ref&gt; (Four decades later, after a McGovern public appearance in that country, the owner of the farm approached the media to let the Senator know that he was the victim of that incident but that no one had been hurt and the farmer felt that it had been worth the price if that event helped achieve the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in some small way.

McGovern's waist gunner was injured, and his flight engineer was so unnerved by his experience that he would subsequently be hospitalized with [[Combat stress reaction|battle fatigue]], but McGovern managed to bring back the plane safely with the assistance of an improvised landing technique.&lt;ref name=&quot;1000-176&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose-240&quot;&gt;Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 240–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later education and early career==
Upon coming home, McGovern returned to Dakota Wesleyan University, aided by the [[G.I.

Nominally a Republican growing up, McGovern began to admire Democratic President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] during World War II, even though he supported Roosevelt's opponent [[Thomas Dewey]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1944 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1972-40&quot;&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knock, ''The Rise of a Prairie Statesman'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In his autobiography, McGovern described his reaction upon hearing of Roosevelt's death in April 1945 while stationed in Italy during the war: &quot;Most of us had never really known the United States except with FDR as President.

Kennedy]]. The president-elect wanted to appoint him, but others felt that McGovern at age 38 lacked sufficient seniority. By the time of Kennedy's selection, McGovern was happy with the lesser position of Food for Peace director, as he had come to realize that Secretary of Agriculture was usually a difficult job and a dead end for political careers.&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, ''A Thousand Days'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} McGovern was picked to become a Special Assistant to the President and first director of Kennedy's high-priority [[Food for Peace]] program, which realized what McGovern had been advocating in the House.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-266&quot;/&gt; McGovern assumed the post on January 21, 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfk-let&quot;/&gt;

As director, McGovern urged the greater use of food to enable foreign economic development, saying, &quot;We should thank God that we have a food abundance and use the over-supply among the under-privileged at home and abroad.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-61&quot;/&gt; He found space for the program in the [[Old Executive Office Building|Executive Office Building]] rather than be subservient to either the [[U.S. Department of State|State Department]] or [[U.S. Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, ''A Thousand Days'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern worked with deputy director [[James W. Symington]] and Kennedy advisor [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] in visiting South America to discuss surplus grain distribution, and attended meetings of the United Nations' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-266&quot;/&gt; In June 1961, McGovern became seriously ill with [[hepatitis]], contracted from an infected White House dispensary needle used to give him inoculations for his South American trip; he was hospitalized and unable to come to his office for two months.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-110&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 110–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the close of 1961, the Food for Peace program was operating in a dozen countries,&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-266&quot;/&gt; and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-110&quot;/&gt; In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded [[school lunch]] program thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently one in five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it,&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-110&quot;/&gt; and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;knock-ftw-107&quot;&gt;Knock, &quot;Feeding the World and Thwarting the Communists&quot;, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; During an audience in Rome, [[Pope John XXIII]] warmly praised McGovern's work,&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-110&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;knock-ftw-114&quot;&gt;Knock, &quot;Feeding the World and Thwarting the Communists&quot;, pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-72&quot;/&gt; In addition, McGovern was instrumental in the creation of the United Nations-run [[World Food Programme]] in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eo-aQU31tfAC&amp;pg=PA97 | title = UN Contributions to Development Thinking and Practice | isbn = 978-0-253-34407-6 | author1 = Jolly | first1 = Richard | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wfp.org/about/corporate-information/mission-statement | title=About WFP | publisher=[[World Food Programme]] | accessdate=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administration was never McGovern's strength, however, and he was restless for another try at the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; With the approval of President Kennedy, McGovern resigned his post on July 18, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-266&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jfk-let&quot;/&gt; Kennedy said that under McGovern, the program had &quot;become a vital force in the world&quot;, improving living conditions and economies of allies and creating &quot;a powerful barrier to the spread of Communism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfk-let&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=8773 | title=Letter Accepting Resignation of George McGovern as Director of the food for Peace Program | author=Kennedy, John F. | publisher=[[The White House]] | date=July 18, 1962 | authorlink=John F.

==U.S. Senator==

===1962 election and early years as a senator===
In April 1962, McGovern announced he would [[United States Senate elections, 1962|run for election to South Dakota's other Senate seat]], intending to face incumbent Republican [[Francis H. Case]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-266&quot;/&gt; Case died in June, however, and McGovern instead faced an appointed senator, former Lieutenant Governor [[Joseph H. Bottum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-266&quot;/&gt; Much of the campaign revolved around policies of the Kennedy administration and its [[New Frontier]];&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-267&quot;&gt;''Current Year Biography 1967'', p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Bottum accused the Kennedy family of trying to buy the Senate seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt102062&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00F1FF73958137A93C2AB178BD95F468685F9 | title=McGovern Wages Uphill Battle in Senate Race in South Dakota | author=Janson, Donald | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 20, 1962 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern appealed to those worried about the outflux of young people from the state, and had the strong support of the [[National Farmers Union (United States)|Farmers Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt102062&quot;/&gt; Polls showed Bottum slightly ahead throughout the race and McGovern was hampered by a recurrence of his hepatitis problem in the final weeks of the campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt102062&quot;/&gt; (During this hospitalization, McGovern read [[Theodore H. White]]'s classic ''[[The Making of the President, 1960]]'' and for the first time began thinking about running for the office someday.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1972-40&quot;/&gt;) Eleanor McGovern campaigned for her ailing husband and may have preserved his chance of winning.&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. ix, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The November 1962 election result was very close and required a recount, but McGovern's 127,458 votes prevailed by a margin of 597, making him the first Democratic senator from the state in 26 years&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-267&quot;/&gt; and only the third since statehood in 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt102062&quot;/&gt;

When he joined the Senate in January 1963 for the [[88th&amp;nbsp;Congress]], McGovern was seated on the [[United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry|Senate Agriculture and Forestry Committee]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-267&quot;/&gt; On the Agriculture Committee, McGovern supported high farm prices, full parity, and controls on beef importation, as well as the administration's [[Feed Grains Acreage Diversion Program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-135&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern had a fractious relationship with Secretary of Agriculture [[Orville Freeman]], who was less sympathetic to farmers; McGovern's 1966 resolution to informally scold Freeman made the senator popular back in his home state.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-135&quot;/&gt; Fellow new senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] saw McGovern as a serious voice on farm policy and often sought McGovern's guidance on agriculture-related votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/us/28senate.html |title=Senate Has Changed in Kennedy's Time |author=Stolberg, Sheryl Gay |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern was largely inactive on the Interior Committee until 1967, when he was given the chair of the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-144&quot;&gt;Anson, McGovern, pp. 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Interior Committee chair [[Henry M. Jackson]], who did not get along with McGovern personally or politically, refused to allow McGovern his own staff, greatly limiting his effectiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-144&quot;/&gt; McGovern regretted not accomplishing more for South Dakota's 30,000 [[Sioux Indian]]s, although after a McGovern-introduced resolution on Indian self-determination passed in 1969, the [[Oglala Sioux]] named McGovern &quot;Great White Eagle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-144&quot;/&gt;

In his first speech on the Senate floor in March 1963, McGovern praised Kennedy's [[Alliance for Progress]] initiative, but spoke out against [[Cuba – United States relations|U.S.&amp;nbsp;policy towards Cuba]], saying that it suffered from &quot;our Castro fixation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-267&quot;/&gt; In August 1963, McGovern advocated reducing the $53&amp;nbsp;billion [[Military budget of the United States|defense budget]] by $5 billion; influenced by advisor [[Seymour Melman]], he held a special antipathy towards the doctrine of [[Nuclear overkill|nuclear &quot;overkill&quot;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-130&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 129–131.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern would try to reduce defense appropriations or limit military expenditures in almost every year during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-133&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; He also voted against many weapons programs, especially missile and anti-missile systems, and also opposed military assistance to foreign nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-133&quot;/&gt; In 1964 McGovern published his first book, ''War Against Want: America's Food for Peace Program''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-267&quot;/&gt; In it he argued for expanding his old program, and a Senate measure he introduced was eventually passed, adding $700&amp;nbsp;million to the effort's funding.&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preferring to focus on broad policy matters and speeches, McGovern was not a master of Senate legislative tactics, and developed a reputation among some other senators for &quot;not doing his homework&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-138&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Described as &quot;a very private, unchummy guy&quot;, he was not a member of the Senate &quot;club&quot; nor did he want to be, turning down in 1969 a chance to join the powerful [[Senate Rules Committee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-138&quot;/&gt; Relatively few pieces of legislation bore his name, and his legislative accomplishments were generally viewed as modest, although he would try to influence the contents of others' bills.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-record&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-138&quot;/&gt; In terms of ideology, McGovern fit squarely within [[modern American liberalism]]; through 1967 he had voted in accordance with the rated positions of the ADA 92&amp;nbsp;percent of the time, and when lacking specific knowledge on a particular matter, he would ask his staff, &quot;What are the liberals doing?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-prof-1968&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-record&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 139–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to Vietnam War===
[[File:George McGovern Vietnam trip Nov 1965.jpg|thumb|left|Senator McGovern on his first trip to South Vietnam, November 1965]]
In a speech on the Senate floor in September 1963, McGovern became the first member to challenge the [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War#Under the Kennedy Administration|growing U.S.&amp;nbsp;military involvement in Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-150&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weil-16&quot;&gt;Weil, ''The Long Shot'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Bothered by the [[Buddhist crisis]] and other recent developments, and with concerns influenced by Vietnam historian [[Bernard Fall]], McGovern said:
{{cquote|The current dilemma in Vietnam is a clear demonstration of the limitations of military power&amp;nbsp;... [Current U.S. involvement] is a policy of moral debacle and political defeat&amp;nbsp;... The trap we have fallen into there will haunt us in every corner of this revolutionary world if we do not properly appraise its lessons.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-record&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-150&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the speech was little noticed, and McGovern backed away from saying anything publicly for over a year afterward, partly because of the November 1963 [[assassination of President Kennedy]] and partly to not appear strident.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-152&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 152–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Though more skeptical about it than most senators,&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-366&quot;&gt;Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', pp. 357, 366–368.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern voted in favor of the August 1964 [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], which turned out to be an essentially unbounded authorization for President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to escalate U.S. involvement in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-record&quot;/&gt; McGovern thought the commander-in-chief should be given limited authority to retaliate against an attack;&lt;ref name=&quot;weil-16&quot;/&gt; subsequently he said his instinct had been to vote no, but that he had voted yes based on Senator [[J. William Fulbright]]'s urging to stand behind Johnson politically.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-152&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-366&quot;/&gt; Indeed, the day after the resolution vote, McGovern spoke concerning his fears that the vote would lead to greater involvement in the war;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-record&quot;/&gt; [[Wayne Morse]], one of only two senators to oppose the resolution, sardonically noted that this fell into the category of &quot;very interesting, but very belated&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-152&quot;/&gt; This would become the vote that McGovern most bitterly regretted.&lt;ref name=&quot;weil-16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-366&quot;/&gt;

In January 1965, McGovern made his first major address on Vietnam, saying that &quot;We are not winning in South Vietnam&amp;nbsp;... I am very much opposed to the policy, now gaining support in Washington, of extending the war to the north.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-267&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-155&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 154–157.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern instead proposed a five-point plan advocating a negotiated settlement involving a federated Vietnam with local autonomy and a UN&amp;nbsp;presence to guarantee security and fair treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-155&quot;/&gt; The speech gave McGovern national visibility as one of the &quot;doves&quot; in the debate over Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-155&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;knock-cha-105&quot;&gt;Knock, &quot;Come Home America&quot;, pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt; However, McGovern made moderate-to-hawkish statements at times too, flatly rejecting unconditional withdrawal of U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces and criticizing [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] [[draft-card burning]]s as &quot;immature, impractical, and illegal&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-160&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 160–164.&lt;/ref&gt; He eschewed personal criticism of Johnson.&lt;ref name=&quot;knock-cha-105&quot;/&gt; In November 1965, McGovern traveled to South Vietnam for three weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-486&quot;&gt;Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; The human carnage he saw in hospital wards deeply upset him, and he became increasingly outspoken about the war upon his return, more convinced than ever that Vietnam was a political, not military, problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-record&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-267&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-160&quot;/&gt; Now he was ready, as he later said, &quot;not merely to dissent, but to crusade&quot; against the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-486&quot;/&gt;

McGovern voted in favor of Vietnam military appropriations in 1966 through 1968, not wanting to deprive U.S. forces of necessary equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-160&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, his anti-war rhetoric increased throughout 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-165&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Johnson had invited McGovern and other Senate doves to the [[White House]] for attempts to explain the rationale for his actions in Vietnam; McGovern came away from the final such visit, in August 1967, shaken by the sight of a president &quot;tortured and confused&amp;nbsp;... by the mess he has gotten into in Vietnam.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-165&quot;/&gt;

===1968 presidential and Senate campaigns===
In August 1967, activist [[Allard K. Lowenstein]] founded the [[Dump Johnson movement]], and soon it was seeking a Democratic Party figure to make a primaries campaign challenge against Johnson in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1968-72&quot;&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1968'', pp. 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's first choice was Senator Robert Kennedy, who declined, as did another, and by late September 1967 they approached McGovern.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-prof-1968&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1968-72&quot;/&gt; After much deliberation McGovern declined, largely because he feared such a run would significantly damage his own chances for reelection to his Senate seat in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-4&quot;/&gt; A month later the anti-Johnson forces were able to convince Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] to run; &lt;ref name=&quot;white-1968-72&quot;/&gt; he was one of the few &quot;dove&quot; senators not up for reelection that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-4&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 2–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1968 Democratic primary campaign, McCarthy staged a strong showing. Robert Kennedy entered the race, President Johnson withdrew and Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] ran instead. While McGovern privately favored Kennedy, McCarthy and Humphrey were both from the neighboring state of Minnesota and publicly McGovern remained neutral.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-188&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 188–192.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 4 South Dakota Democratic primary, which resulted in a strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-188&quot;/&gt; McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy was assassinated]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-188&quot;/&gt; The death of Bobby Kennedy left McGovern the most emotionally distraught he had ever been to that point in his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-188&quot;/&gt;

Within days, some of Kennedy's aides were urging McGovern to run in his place; their antipathy towards McCarthy and ideological opposition to Humphrey made them unwilling to support either candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-193&quot;/&gt; McGovern delayed making a decision, making sure that Bobby's brother [[Ted Kennedy]] did not want to enter, and with his staff still concerned about the senator's own reelection prospects.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-193&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 192–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, McGovern's voting had changed during 1968, with his ADA rating falling to 43 as he sought more middle-of-the-road stances.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-record&quot;/&gt; In late July, McGovern's decision became more complicated when his daughter Teresa was arrested in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] on [[drug possession|marijuana possession]] charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10C10F93E5E1A7B93CAAB178CD85F4C8685F9 |title= McGovern's Daughter Held |agency=[[United Press International]] |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 28, 1968 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had led a troubled life since her teenage years, developing problems with alcohol and depression and suffering the consequences of a relationship with an unstable neighborhood boy.&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, ''Terry'', pp. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a recently enacted strict state drugs law, Terry now faced a minimum five-year prison sentence if found guilty.&lt;ref name=&quot;terry-71&quot;&gt;McGovern, ''Terry'', pp. 71–74.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern was also convinced that the socially conservative voters of South Dakota would reject him due to his daughter's arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;terry-71&quot;/&gt; Charges against her were subsequently dropped due to a technically invalid search warrant.&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

McGovern formally announced his candidacy on August 10, 1968, in Washington, two weeks in advance of the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], committing himself to &quot;the goals for which Robert Kennedy gave his life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10D13F8345E157A8EDDA80994D0405B888AF1D3 |title= M'Govern Opens Presidential Bid With Peace Plea |author=Hunter, Majorie |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 11, 1968 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked why he was a better choice than McCarthy, he said, &quot;Well – Gene really doesn't want to be President, and I do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1968-265&quot;/&gt; At the convention in Chicago, Humphrey was the near-certain choice while McGovern became the initial rallying point for around 300 leaderless Kennedy delegates.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1968-265&quot;&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1968'', pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt; The chaotic circumstances of the convention found McGovern denouncing the Chicago police tactics against demonstrators as &quot;police brutality&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-207&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 207–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the internal politics of the party, it was difficult for McGovern to gain in delegate strength, and black protest candidate [[Channing E. Phillips]] drew off some of his support.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-207&quot;/&gt; In the actual roll call, McGovern came in third with 146½ delegates, far behind Humphrey's 1760¼ and McCarthy's 601.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1968'', Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt;

McGovern endorsed Humphrey at the convention, to the dismay of some anti-war figures who considered it a betrayal.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-207&quot;/&gt; Humphrey went on to lose the general election to [[Richard Nixon]]. McGovern returned to his Senate reelection race, facing Republican former Governor [[Archie M. Gubbrud]]. While South Dakota voters sympathized with McGovern over his daughter's arrest,&lt;ref name=&quot;terry-76&quot;&gt;McGovern, ''Terry'', pp. 76, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; he initially suffered a substantial drop in popularity over the events in Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-213&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 213–216.&lt;/ref&gt; However, McGovern conducted an energetic campaign that focused on his service to the state, while Gubbrud ran a lackluster effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-213&quot;/&gt; In November, McGovern won 57&amp;nbsp;percent of the vote in what he would consider the easiest and most decisive victory of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;terry-76&quot;/&gt;

===Middle Senate years and continued opposition to the Vietnam War===
During the 1968 Democratic Convention, a motion had been passed to establish a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', pp. 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, McGovern was named chair of the [[McGovern-Fraser Commission|Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection]], also known as the McGovern–Fraser Commission; due to the influence of former McCarthy and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and [[primary election|primaries]], and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', pp. 24–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reichley-285&quot;/&gt; A somewhat unintended consequence of the commission's reforms was a massive increase in the number of presidential primaries; this became true for the Republican Party as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;kauf&quot;/&gt; The U.S.&amp;nbsp;presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.&lt;ref name=&quot;reichley-285&quot;&gt;Reichley, ''The Life of the Parties'', pp. 283, 285–287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kauf&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kaufmann | first=Karen M. | first2=James G. | last2=Gimpel | first3=Adam H. | last3=Hoffman | title=A Promise Fulfilled?

In the wake of several high-profile reports about hunger and [[malnutrition]] in the United States, the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs|Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]] had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chair.&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 220–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to [[Immokalee, Florida]], the base for 20,000 [[migrant farm worker]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-225&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 225–229.&lt;/ref&gt; They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-225&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70C10FD3B5D137A93C3A81788D85F4D8685F9 |title=Senators on Hunger Tour See Squalor in Florida |author=Hunter, Majorie |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 11, 1969 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress during much of the next year over an expanded [[Food Stamp Program]]; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 229–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

McGovern generally lacked both interest and expertise in [[economics]], but was outspoken in reaction to Nixon's imposition of [[wage and price controls]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern declared: &quot;This administration, which pledged to slow inflation and reduce unemployment, has instead given us the highest rate of inflation and the highest rate of unemployment in a decade.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title | title=Economic Crisis: 1971 Year in Review | publisher=United Press International | accessdate=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[60 Minutes]]'' included him in a 1971 report about liberal politicians and journalists who advocated integrated schooling while avoiding it for their children.{{refn|The report, by [[Mike Wallace]], detailed the senator's support of [[Desegregation busing in the United States|desegregation busing]] even while the Washington, D.C., resident was paying non-resident tuition for his own daughter to attend [[Bethesda, Maryland]], public schools, which were only 3&amp;nbsp;percent black.

{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}}
But most of all, McGovern was known for his continued opposition to the Vietnam War. In March 1969, he became the first senator to explicitly criticize the new president's policy there, an action that was seen as a breach of customary protocol by other Senate doves.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-168&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 167–169.&lt;/ref&gt; The diversion during these years of much of Food for Peace's aid to South Vietnam, instead of other badly stricken countries around the world, greatly upset him.&lt;ref&gt;Knock, &quot;Feeding the World and Thwarting the Communists&quot;, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1969, McGovern was calling for an immediate cease-fire and a total withdrawal of all American troops within a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-168&quot;/&gt; In October 1969, McGovern was a featured speaker before 100,000&amp;nbsp;demonstrators in Boston at the [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]], and in November he spoke before 350,000 at Moratorium/[[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|Mobilization]]'s anti-war march to the [[Washington Monument]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-172&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 169–174.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, he decided that radicalized peace demonstrations were counterproductive and criticized anti-war figures such as [[Rennie Davis]], [[Tom Hayden]], [[Huey Newton]], [[Abbie Hoffman]], and [[Jerry Rubin]] as &quot;reckless&quot; and &quot;irresponsible&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-172&quot;/&gt;

Instead, McGovern focused on legislative means to bring the war to an end.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-177&quot;/&gt; The [[McGovern–Hatfield Amendment]] to the annual military procurement bill, co-sponsored by Republican [[Mark Hatfield]] of Oregon, required via funding cutoff a complete withdrawal of all American forces from Indochina by the end of 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt090270&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0B1FF73D551B7493C0A91782D85F448785F9 | title=Senate Defeats 'End War' Move By Vote Of 55–39 | author=Smith, Robert M. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 2, 1970 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It underwent months of public discussion and alterations to make it acceptable to more senators, including pushing the deadline out to the end of 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-669&quot;/&gt; In May 1970, McGovern obtained a [[second mortgage]] on his Washington home in order to fund a half-hour televised panel discussion on the amendment on [[NBC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-669&quot;/&gt; The broadcast brought in over $500,000 in donations that furthered work on passage,&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-177&quot;/&gt; and eventually the amendment gained the support of the majority of the public in polls.&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-669&quot;/&gt; The effort was denounced by opposition groups organized by White House aide [[Charles Colson]], which called McGovern and Hatfield &quot;apostles of retreat and defeat&quot; and &quot;salesmen of surrender&quot; and maintained that only the president could conduct foreign policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-669&quot;/&gt; The amendment was defeated in September 1970 by a 55–39 vote, just short of what McGovern had hoped would constitute at least a [[moral victory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-177&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 174–178.&lt;/ref&gt; During the floor debate McGovern criticized his colleagues opposing the measure:
{{cquote|
Every Senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. This chamber reeks of blood. Every Senator here is partly responsible for that human wreckage at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval and all across our land—young men without legs, or arms, or genitals, or faces or hopes. There are not very many of these blasted and broken boys who think this war is a glorious adventure. Do not talk to them about bugging out, or national honor or courage. It does not take any courage at all for a congressman, or a senator, or a president to wrap himself in the flag and say we are staying in Vietnam, because it is not our blood that is being shed. But we are responsible for those young men and their lives and their hopes. And if we do not end this damnable war those young men will some day curse us for our pitiful willingness to let the Executive carry the burden that the Constitution places on us.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-177&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-669&quot;/&gt;}}

The Senate reacted in startled, stunned silence, and some faces showed anger and fury;&lt;ref name=&quot;weil-16&quot;/&gt; when one member told McGovern he had been personally offended by the speech, McGovern said, &quot;That's what I meant to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mann-669&quot;&gt;Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', pp. 666–670.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern believed Vietnam an immoral war that was destroying much of what was pure, hopeful, and different about America's character as a nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;weil-16&quot;/&gt;

The defeat of the amendment left McGovern embittered and somewhat more radicalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-179&quot;&gt;Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; He accused Vice President of South Vietnam [[Nguyen Cao Ky]] of running a heroin trafficking operation that was addicting American soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-179&quot;/&gt; In a retort to the powerful Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]] chair [[John Stennis]]' suggestion that U.S.&amp;nbsp;troops might have to return to Cambodia, McGovern declared, &quot;I'm tired of old men dreaming up wars for young men to fight. If he wants to use American ground troops in Cambodia, let him lead the charge himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=355047 | newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] | title=McGovern Runs for President | date=February 17, 1971 | author=Southwick, Thomas P.}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denounced Nixon's policy of [[Vietnamization]] as &quot;subsidiz[ing] the continued killing of the people of Indochina by technology and mercenaries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, he said that [[Ho Chi Minh]] was the North Vietnamese [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anson-179&quot;/&gt;

McGovern's campaign manager, [[Gary Hart]], decided on a guerrilla-like insurgency strategy of battling Muskie in only selected primaries, not everywhere, so as to focus the campaign's organizational strength and resources.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GeorgeMcGovern.png|thumb|left|upright|McGovern as seen in a 1972 campaign poster]]

Muskie fell victim to inferior organizing, an over-reliance on party endorsements, and Nixon's &quot;dirty tricks&quot; operatives,&lt;ref name=&quot;witcover-579&quot;&gt;Witcover, ''Party of the People'', pp. 578–580.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reichley, ''The Life of the Parties'', pp. 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the March 7, 1972, [[New Hampshire primary]], did worse than expected with McGovern coming in a close second.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', pp. 80–82.&lt;/ref&gt; As Muskie's campaign funding and support dried up, Hubert Humphrey, who had rejoined the Senate, became McGovern's primary rival for the nomination,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-071372-nom&quot;/&gt; with Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] also in the mix after dominating the March 14 primary in Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;witcover-579&quot;/&gt; McGovern won a key breakthrough victory over Humphrey and Wallace on April 4 in Wisconsin,&lt;ref name=&quot;witcover-579&quot;/&gt; where he added blue-collar economic populism to his appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed that by dominating the April 25 primary in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1972-106&quot;&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', pp. 106–107, 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, McGovern had become the front runner.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1972-106&quot;/&gt; A late decision to enter the May 2 Ohio primary, considered a Humphrey stronghold, paid dividends when McGovern managed a very close second there amid charges of election fraud by pro-Humphrey forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-mitn-72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The other two leading candidates for the nomination also won primaries, but Wallace's campaign effectively ended when he was seriously wounded in a May assassination attempt,&lt;ref name=&quot;witcover-581&quot;/&gt; and McGovern's operation was effective in garnering delegates in caucus states.&lt;ref&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; The climactic contest took place in California, with Humphrey attacking McGovern in several televised debates; in the June 6 vote, McGovern defeated him by five percentage points and claimed all the delegates due to the state's winner-take-all rules.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', pp. 121–122, 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt; He then appeared to clinch the nomination with delegates won in the New York primary on June 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;witcover-581&quot;&gt;Witcover, ''Party of the People'', pp. 580–582.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Humphrey's attacks on McGovern as being too radical began a downward slide in the latter's poll standing against Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;
McGovern became tagged with the label &quot;amnesty, abortion and acid&quot;, supposedly reflecting his positions.{{refn|The label's origins later turned out to come from Thomas Eagleton, several months before he became the vice presidential nominee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19694666/page/7/#.UPvlrnex5t0 |title='Meet the Press' transcript for July 15, 2007 | publisher=[[NBC News]] | date=July 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giglio, &quot;The Eagleton Affair&quot;, p. 650.&lt;!--approx--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

McGovern ran on a [[political platform|platform]] that advocated withdrawal from the Vietnam War in exchange for the return of American [[prisoners of war]]&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and amnesty for draft evaders who had left the country.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;
McGovern's platform also included an across-the-board, 37-percent reduction in defense spending over three years.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a &quot;demogrant&quot; program that would give a $1,000 payment to every citizen in America.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1972-119&quot;&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; Based around existing ideas such as the [[negative income tax]] and intended to replace the welfare bureaucracy and complicated maze of existing public-assistance programs, it nonetheless garnered considerable derision as a poorly thought-out &quot;liberal giveaway&quot; and was dropped from the platform in August.&lt;ref name=&quot;witcover-579&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1972-119&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time-issues&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,906634,00.html | title=Issues '72: Nixon v.

An &quot;Anybody But McGovern&quot; coalition, led by southern Democrats and organized labor, formed in the weeks following the final primaries.&lt;ref&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 74–78.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern's nomination did not become assured until the first night of the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], where, following intricate parliamentary maneuverings led by campaign staffer [[Rick Stearns]], a Humphrey credentials challenge regarding the California winner-take-all rules was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72'', pp. 276–310.&lt;/ref&gt; Divisive arguments over the party platform then followed; what resulted was arguably the most liberal one of any major U.S. party.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt; On July 12, 1972, McGovern officially won the Democratic nomination.

After this loss, McGovern remained in the Senate. He was scarred by the enormous defeat,&lt;ref name=&quot;miroff-293&quot;&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Eleanor took it even worse; during the winter of 1972–73, the couple seriously considered moving to England.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytm-mcginniss&quot;/&gt; His allies were replaced in positions of power within the Democratic Party leadership, and the McGoverns did not get publicly introduced at party affairs they attended.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-might&quot;/&gt; On January 20, 1973, a few hours after Richard Nixon was re-inaugurated, McGovern gave a speech at the [[Oxford Union]] that talked about the abuses of Nixon's presidency; it brought criticism, including from some Democrats, for being ill-mannered.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-might&quot;/&gt; In order to get past the &quot;bitterness and self-pity&quot; he felt, McGovern forced himself to deal with the defeat humorously before audiences; starting at the March 1973 [[Gridiron Dinner]], he frequently related his campaign misadventures in a self-deprecating fashion, such as saying, &quot;For many years, I wanted to run for the Presidency in the worst possible way – and last year I sure did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-might&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytm-mcginniss&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, emotions surrounding the loss would remain with McGovern for decades, as it did with some other defeated presidential nominees.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-might&quot;/&gt; Nixon resigned in August 1974 due to the Watergate scandal.

McGovern displayed the political resiliency he had shown in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;miroff-293&quot;/&gt; In the [[United States Senate elections, 1974|1974 U.S. Senate elections]], McGovern faced possible political peril due to having neglected the state during his long presidential campaign, and by May 1973, he had already begun campaigning for reelection.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytm-mcginniss&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20B13FD3954137A93C4A9178ED85F478785F9 | author=McGinniss, Joe | title=Second Thoughts of George McGovern | magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] | date=May 6, 1973 | authorlink=Joe McGinniss}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Air Force pilot and Medal of Honor recipient, [[Leo K.

On July 26, 2015, the ''[[Argus Leader]]'', the daily newspaper in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], published an article detailing the extensive files on McGovern compiled through the years by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], including letters and notations from FBI Director [[J.

[[File:McGovern Speaking 1.JPG|thumb|left|George McGovern speaking at the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum]] on August 26, 2009]]
Due to his resounding loss to Nixon in the 1972 election and the causes behind it, &quot;McGovernism&quot; became a label that a generation of Democratic politicians tried to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, nationally syndicated ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' columnist [[Bob Greene]] wrote, &quot;Once again politicians – mostly Republicans, but some Democrats, too – are using his name as a synonym for presidential campaigns that are laughable and out of touch with the American people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bob greene&quot;&gt;{{cite news
| title=McGovern not haunted by '72 race
| author=[[Bob Greene|Greene, Bob]]
| newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]
| date=August 9, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives used McGovern's name as a ready synonym for what they saw as liberal failures.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt; Indeed, according to Daniel McCarthy of ''[[The American Conservative]]'', the Republican Party began to act after 1972 as if &quot;every Democratic leader, no matter how Southern, how pro-war, how middle-of-the-road, is really a McGovernite. Indeed, for nearly 40 years the conservative movement has defined itself in opposition to the Democratic standard-bearer of 1972. Anti-McGovernism has come to play for the Right the unifying role that anticommunism once played, much to the detriment of older principles such as limited government, fiscal continence, and prudence in foreign policy.&quot;&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite news | author=McCarthy, Daniel | date=January 12, 2009 | url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2009/jan/12/00016/ | title=McGovern Beats Nixon | magazine=[[The American Conservative]]}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association with dovishness and weakness on defense has been especially prevalent,&lt;ref name=&quot;miroff-1&quot;&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; although McGovern publicly stated in 1972 that he was not a [[pacifism|pacifist]] and that use of force was sometimes necessary, such as in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,906071,00.html |title=Defense: Pulling Back |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=June 26, 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern later said in 2001 that his political image had been exaggerated: &quot;I am a liberal and always have been – just not the wild-eyed character the Republicans made me out to be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-label&quot;/&gt; He continued to feel that he was marginalized with his views miscast.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap102906&quot;/&gt; He saw himself as a son of the prairie, in 2005 reciting his traditional upbringing and family values, culminating with &quot;I'm what a normal, healthy, ideal American should be like&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt; and in 2006 said, &quot;How the hell do you get elected in South Dakota for twenty years if you're a wild-eyed radical?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap102906&quot;/&gt;

In later decades the former senator remained a symbol, or standard-bearer, of the [[political left]], particularly in relation to the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s when the country was torn by U.S.&amp;nbsp;involvement in the Vietnam War and the corruption and abuse of power of the Nixon administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/us/politics/george-mcgovern-a-democratic-presidential-nominee-and-liberal-stalwart-dies-at-90.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |title=A Prairie Liberal, Trounced but Never Silenced |author=Rosenbaum, David E. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 22, 2012 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career, McGovern's positions reflected his own experiences as well as a personal synthesis of the traditions of American liberalism and progressivism.&lt;ref name=&quot;knock-cha-84&quot;&gt;Knock, &quot;Come Home America&quot;, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southern Methodist University]] historian Thomas J. Knock wrote in 2003 that &quot;[McGovern's] career was extraordinary and historic ... primarily because of his impress as searching and prophetic critic&quot; and that &quot;few political careers offer an alternative understanding of the American Century as compelling and instructive as McGovern's.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;knock-cha-84&quot;/&gt;

As chair of the McGovern–Fraser Commission in 1969–70, McGovern instituted major changes in Democratic party rules that continue to this day and, to a large degree, were ultimately adopted by the Republican Party as well, with large institutional changes taking place in both.&lt;ref name=&quot;reichley-285&quot;/&gt; Among those was the centralization of decisions about the nominating process at the national party level, rather than with the states.&lt;ref name=&quot;cook-44&quot;&gt;Cook, ''The Presidential Nominating Process'', pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; His 1972 campaign fundamentally altered how presidential primary campaigns were waged.&lt;ref name=&quot;miroff-2&quot;&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Democratic Party, power shifted from the [[New Deal coalition]] to younger, more affluent, issue-oriented activists; the women's movement and gay rights movement found a place; skepticism about military buildups and foreign interventions took hold; and the 1960s &quot;New Politics&quot; found its culmination in McGovern's nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;miroff-2&quot;/&gt; In turn, the overwhelming defeat of McGovern in the general election led to the liberal wing of the party's being stigmatized for decades to come and a turn in the party towards centrist directions.&lt;ref name=&quot;miroff-2&quot;/&gt; McGovern himself recognized the mixed results of his 1972 candidacy, saying, &quot;We made a serious effort to open the doors of the Democratic Party – and as soon as we did, half the Democrats walked out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytm-mcginniss&quot;/&gt; [[SUNY Albany]] political scientist Bruce Miroff wrote in 2007 that the McGovern campaign was the last time in presidential politics that liberals had &quot;their chance to speak of their goals with enthusiasm and their dreams with fire&amp;nbsp;... Yet almost at the instant that the insurgents successfully stormed the heights of American politics, they found themselves on the brink of one of the worst free falls on record.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;miroff-1&quot;/&gt;

Staffers who worked on McGovern's 1972 campaign later became influential within the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;miroff-290&quot;&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 290–293.&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign manager Gary Hart staged his own presidential runs in 1984 and 1988. Future president Bill Clinton, with assistance from his future wife and politician [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham]], had managed the McGovern campaign's operations in Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt; Hart both embraced and moved away from aspects of his past affiliation with McGovern,&lt;ref&gt;Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', pp. 286–288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witcover, ''Party of the People'', p. 635.&lt;/ref&gt; while Clinton, and the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] movement of which he was a part, explicitly rejected McGovern's ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Witcover, ''Party of the People'', p. 632.&lt;/ref&gt; But there was still a legacy in terms of staffing, as the Clinton White House would be full of former &quot;McGovernites&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;miroff-290&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knock, &quot;Feeding the World and Thwarting the Communists&quot;, pp. 114, 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

McGovern's post-political career generally enhanced his reputation; [[Tom Brokaw]], who referred to McGovern as part of the &quot;[[Greatest Generation]]&quot;, wrote in 1998 that &quot;He remains one of the country's most decent and thoughtful public servants.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brokaw-121&quot;/&gt;
McGovern's legacy also includes his commitment to combating hunger both in the United States and around the globe. He said, &quot;After I'm gone, I want people to say about me: He did the best he could to end hunger in this country and the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;staug&quot;/&gt; In the view of Knock, McGovern in all his activities arguably accomplished more for people in need than most presidents or secretaries of state in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=&quot;knock-ftw-114&quot;/&gt; Responding to the [[Serenity Prayer]]'s desire to &quot;grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change&quot;, McGovern said simply that he rejected that notion: &quot;I keep trying to change them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap102906&quot;/&gt;
