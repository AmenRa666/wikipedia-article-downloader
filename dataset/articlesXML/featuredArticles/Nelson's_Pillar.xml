'''Nelson's Pillar''' (also known as the '''Nelson Pillar''' or simply '''the Pillar''') was a large granite column capped by a statue of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], built in the centre of what was then Sackville Street (later renamed [[O'Connell Street]]) in [[Dublin]], Ireland. Completed in 1809 when Ireland was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], it survived until March 1966, when it was severely damaged by explosives planted by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]]. Its remnants were later destroyed by the [[Irish Army]].

The decision to build the monument was taken by [[Dublin Corporation]] in the euphoria following Nelson's victory  at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. The original design by [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] was greatly modified by [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]], on grounds of cost. The statue was sculpted by [[Thomas Kirk (sculptor)|Thomas Kirk]]. From its opening on 29 October 1809 the Pillar was a popular tourist attraction, but provoked aesthetic and political controversy from the outset. A prominent city centre monument honouring an Englishman rankled as nationalist sentiment grew, and throughout the 19th century there were calls for it to be removed, or replaced with a memorial to an Irish hero.

Parts of central Dublin were destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]], but although it was near the rebels' headquarters, the Pillar remained unscathed. It remained in the city as Ireland became an independent [[Irish Free State|Free State]] in 1922, and a [[Republic of Ireland|republic]] in 1949. The chief legal barrier to its removal was the trust created at the Pillar's inception, the terms of which gave the trustees a duty in perpetuity to preserve the monument. Successive Irish governments failed to deliver legislation overriding the trust.  Although influential literary figures such as [[James Joyce]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]] defended the Pillar on historical and cultural grounds, pressure for its removal intensified in the years preceding the 50th anniversary of the Rising, and its sudden demise was, on the whole, well received by the public. Although it was widely believed that the action was the work of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–69)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), the police were unable to identify any of those responsible.

After years of debate and numerous proposals, the site was occupied in 2003 by the [[Spire of Dublin]], a slim needle-like structure rising almost three times the height of the  Pillar. In 2000 a former republican activist gave a radio interview in which he admitted planting the explosives in 1966, but after questioning him the police decided not to take action. Relics of the Pillar are found in Dublin museums and appear as decorative stonework elsewhere, and its memory is preserved in numerous works of Irish literature.

==Background==

===Sackville Street and Blakeney===
[[File:1stBaronBlakeney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Painting of William Blakeney|William Blakeney, whose Sackville Street statue preceded Nelson's]]
The redevelopment of [[Dublin]] north of the [[River Liffey]] began in the early 18th century, largely through the enterprise of the property speculator [[Luke Gardiner]].{{sfn| Andrews and Coleman 2009}} His best-known work was the transformation in the 1740s of  a narrow lane called Drogheda Street, which he demolished and turned into a broad thoroughfare lined with large and imposing town houses. He renamed it Sackville Street, in honour of [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset]], who served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] from 1731 to 1737 and from 1751 to 1755.{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=114}} After Gardiner's death in 1755  Dublin's growth continued, with many fine public buildings and grand squares, the city's status magnified by the presence of the [[Parliament of Ireland]]  for six months of the year.{{sfn|Kilfeather|2005|p=54}} The [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union of 1800]], which united Ireland and [[Great Britain]] under a single [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster polity]], ended  the Irish parliament and presaged a period of decline for the city.{{sfn|Hunt|2014|p=137}} The historian [[Tristram Hunt]] writes: &quot;[T]he capital's dynamism vanished, absenteeism returned and the big houses lost their patrons&quot;.{{sfn|Hunt|2014|p=137}}

The first monument in Sackville Street was built in 1759 in the location where the Nelson Pillar would eventually stand. The subject was [[William Blakeney, 1st Baron Blakeney]], a [[Limerick]]-born army officer whose career extended over  more than 60 years and ended with his surrender to the French after the [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|Siege of Minorca]] in 1756.{{sfn|Stephens and Harding 2008}} A brass statue sculpted by [[John van Nost the younger]] was unveiled on [[St Patrick's Day]], 17 March 1759.{{sfn|Fallon |2014|pp=5–8}}{{refn|Most unusually for the subject of a statue, Blakeney was still alive at the time—he died in September 1761.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=5–8}} |group= n}}  Donal Fallon, in his history of the Pillar, states that almost from its inception the Blakeney statue was a target for vandalism. Its fate is uncertain; Fallon records that it might have been melted down for cannon,{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=8}} but it had  certainly been removed by 1805.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=7–8}}

===Trafalgar===
[[File:Fall of Nelson.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Nelson's death scene|Nelson's death aboard HMS ''Victory'', 21 October 1805]]
On 21 October 1805, a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] fleet commanded by [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Vice Admiral Lord Nelson]] defeated the combined fleets of the French and Spanish navies in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. At the height of the battle  Nelson was  mortally wounded on board his flagship, {{HMS|Victory}}; by the time he died later that day, victory was assured.{{sfn|Rodger 2009}}

Nelson had been hailed in Dublin seven years earlier, after the [[Battle of the Nile]], as defender of the Harp and Crown, the respective symbols of Ireland and Britain.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|p=337}} When news of Trafalgar reached the city on 8 November, there were similar scenes of patriotic celebration, together with a desire that the fallen hero should be commemorated.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=24}}  The mercantile classes had particular reason to be grateful for a victory that restored the freedom of the high seas and removed the threat of a French invasion.{{sfn|Ó Riain |1998}} Many of the city's population had relatives who had been involved in the battle: up to one-third of the sailors in Nelson's fleet were from Ireland, including around 400 from Dublin itself. In his short account of the Pillar, [[Dennis Campbell Kennedy|Dennis Kennedy]] considers that Nelson would have been regarded in the city as a hero, not just among the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]  but by many Catholics among the rising middle and professional classes.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=25–27}}

The first step towards a permanent memorial to Nelson was taken on 18 November 1805 by the city [[aldermen]], who after sending a message of congratulation to [[King George III]], agreed that the erection of a statue would form a suitable tribute to  Nelson's memory.{{sfn|Henchy|1948|p=53}}{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=26}} On 28 November, after a public meeting had supported this sentiment, a &quot;Nelson committee&quot; was established, chaired by the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Lord Mayor]]. It contained four of the city's Westminster MPs, alongside other city notables including  [[Arthur Guinness II|Arthur Guinness]], the son of the brewery founder.{{sfn|Henchy|1948|p=54}} The committee's initial tasks were to decide precisely what form the monument should take and where it should be put. They had also to raise the funds to pay for it.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=3–4}}

==Inception, design and construction==

At its first meeting the Nelson committee established a public subscription, and early in 1806 invited artists and architects to submit design proposals for a monument.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=27–28}} No specifications were provided, but the contemporary European vogue in commemorative architecture was for the classical form, typified by [[Trajan's Column]] in Rome.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=3–4}} [[Victory column|Monumental columns]], or &quot;pillars of victory&quot;, were uncommon in Ireland at the time; the Cumberland Column in [[Birr, County Offaly]], erected in 1747, was a rare exception.{{sfn|Contae Uíbh Fhailí County Council, February 2009}} From the entries submitted, the Nelson committee's choice was that of a young English architect, [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], then in the early stages of a distinguished career.{{refn|In his later   career Wilkins was responsible for the design of numerous major London buildings, including the [[National Gallery]] and [[University College London]], and of a number of colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]].{{sfn|Liscombe|2009}}|group= n}} Wilkins's proposals envisaged a tall [[Doric order|Doric column]] on a plinth, surmounted by a sculpted Roman [[galley]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=6}}

The choice of the Sackville Street site was not unanimous. The [[Wide Streets Commission]]ers  were worried about traffic congestion, and argued for a riverside location visible from the sea.{{sfn|Ó Riain|1998}} Another suggestion was for a seaside position, perhaps [[Howth Head]] at the entrance to [[Dublin Bay]]. The recent presence of the Blakeney statue in Sackville Street, and a desire to arrest the street's decline in the post-parliamentary years, were factors that may have influenced the final selection of that site which, Kennedy says, was the preferred choice of the Lord Lieutenant.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=6–8}}

This first STONE of a Triumphal PILLAR was laid by HIS GRACE CHARLES DUKE OF RICHMOND and LENNOX, Lord Lieutenant General and General Governor of Ireland, on the 15th Day of February in the year of our Lord, 1808. and in the 48th Year of our most GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN GEORGE THE THIRD, in the presence of the Committee appointed by the Subscribers for erecting this monument.&lt;/small&gt;  |salign = left|source=  Wording of memorial plaque laid with the foundation stone, 15 February 1808''' {{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=15}}   }}
By mid-1807, fundraising was proving difficult; sums raised at that point were well short of the likely cost of erecting Wilkins's column. The committee informed the architect with regret that &quot;means were not placed in their hands to enable them to gratify him, as well as themselves, by executing his design precisely as he had given it&quot;.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=10–11}}  They employed [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]], architect to the City Board of Works, to make cost-cutting adjustments to Wilkins's scheme.{{sfn|Murphy|2010|p=11}}{{refn|Johnston's later Dublin commissions included the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] and additions to the [[Áras an Uachtaráin|Vice-regal Lodge]].{{sfn|Cust and Bagshaw 2008}} |group= n}} Johnston simplified the design, substituting  a large functional block or pedestal for Wilkins's delicate plinth, and replacing the proposed galley with a  statue of Nelson.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=10–11}}  [[Thomas Kirk (sculptor)|Thomas Kirk]], a sculptor from [[Cork (city)|Cork]], was commissioned to provide the statue, to be fashioned from [[Portland stone]].{{sfn|Henchy|1948|p=59}}{{sfn|Kilfeather|2005|p=260}}

By December 1807 the fund stood at £3,827, far short of the estimated £6,500 required to finance the project.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=15}}{{refn|£6,500 in 1805 equates to about £500,000 in 2016, using the GDP deflator for capital projects.{{sfn|MeasuringWorth 2016}}|group= n}} Nevertheless, by the beginning of 1808 the committee felt confident enough to begin the work, and organised the laying of the foundation stone. This ceremony took place on 15 February 1808—the day following the anniversary of Nelson's victory at the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]] in 1797{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=16–17}}—amid much pomp, in the presence of the new Lord Lieutenant, the [[Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]], along with various civic dignitaries and city notables.{{sfn|Murphy|2010|p=9}}  A memorial plaque eulogising Nelson's Trafalgar victory was attached to the stone. The committee continued to raise money as construction proceeded;{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=16–17}} when the project was complete in the autumn of 1809,  costs totalled £6,856, but contributions had reached £7,138, providing the committee with a surplus of £282.{{sfn|Henchy|1948|pp=56–57}}

When finished, the monument complete with its statue rose to a height of {{convert|134|ft|m|1}}.{{refn|The recorded heights (rounded) of the various components were: pedestal 30&amp;nbsp;ft 1&amp;nbsp;in.; column and capital 78&amp;nbsp;ft 3&amp;nbsp;in.; epistilion (the base for the statue)  12&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in.; statue 13&amp;nbsp;ft; total 134&amp;nbsp;ft 3&amp;nbsp;in.{{sfn| Warburton, Whitelaw and Walsh 1818|pp= 1102–03}} |group= n}} The four sides of the pedestal were engraved with the names and dates of Nelson's greatest victories.{{sfn|Henchy|1948|pp= 56–57}}{{refn|The inscriptions on each side were as follows: &quot;ST.

These refer to the following battles and their dates: [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]] (14 February 1797); [[Battle of the Nile]] (1–3 August 1798); [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]] (2 April 1801); and [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (21 October 1805).{{sfn| Warburton, Whitelaw and Walsh 1818|p= 1101}}|group= n}} A spiral stairway of 168 steps ascended the hollow interior of the column, to a viewing platform immediately beneath the statue.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=33}} According to the committee's  published report, {{convert|22090|cuft|m3}} of black [[limestone]]  and {{convert|7310|cuft|m3}} of [[granite]] had been used to build the column and its pedestal.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=32}} The Pillar opened to the public on 21 October 1809, on the fourth anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar; for ten [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pre-decimal]] pence,{{sfn|Henchy|1948|pp=56–57}}{{refn|10 pre-decimal pence in 1809 equates to £2.70 in 2016, based on [[retail price index (UK)|retail price index]].{{sfn|MeasuringWorth 2016}} |group= n}} visitors could climb to a viewing platform just below the statue, and enjoy what an early report describes as &quot;a superb panoramic view of the city, the country and the fine bay&quot;.{{sfn| Warburton, Whitelaw and Walsh 1818|p= 1101}}{{refn|At almost the same time as the Dublin pillar was being completed, the city of [[Montreal]] in Canada erected [[Nelson's Column, Montreal|a column and statue of Nelson]]. Although largely French-speaking, the inhabitants of Montreal detested the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleon]] and regarded Nelson as a hero. In more recent times the Montreal monument has survived attempts by [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatists]] to have it removed.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=20–21, 29–30}}  |group= n}}

==History 1809–1966==

===1809–1916===

The Pillar quickly became a popular tourist attraction; Kennedy writes that &quot;for the next 157 years its ascent was a must on every visitor's list&quot;.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=20}} Yet from the beginning there were criticisms, on both political and aesthetic grounds. The September 1809 issue of the ''Irish Monthly Magazine'', edited by the revolution-minded Walter &quot;Watty&quot; Cox,{{sfn|Webb: A Compendium of Irish Biography 1878}} reported that &quot;our independence has been wrested from us, not by the arms of France but by the gold of England. The statue of Nelson records the glory of a mistress and the transformation of our senate into a discount office&quot;.{{sfn|Ó Riain|1998}}  In an early (1818) history of the city of Dublin, the writers express awe at the scale of the monument, but are critical of several of its features: its proportions are described as &quot;ponderous&quot;, the pedestal as &quot;unsightly&quot; and the column itself as &quot;clumsy&quot;.{{sfn| Warburton, Whitelaw and Walsh 1818|pp= 1102–03}} However, the ''Hibernian Magazine'' thought the statue was a good likeness of its subject, and that the Pillar's position in the centre of the wide street gave the eye a focal point in what was otherwise &quot;wastes of pavements&quot;.{{sfn|Henchy|1948|p=60}}
[[File:Sackville St Dublin 1842.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Artwork of statue of Nelson on top of a Doric column in a broad street lined with buildings, with pedestrians and horses and cart on a bridge in the foreground|Lower Sackville Street and the Pillar depicted by [[William Henry Bartlett]] in the early 1840s, around the time of Thackeray's visit]]
By 1830, rising nationalist sentiment in Ireland made it likely that the Pillar was &quot;the Ascendancy's last hurrah&quot;—Kennedy observes that it probably could not have been built at any later date.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=30}}  Nevertheless, the monument often attracted favourable comment from visitors; in 1842 the writer [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] noted Nelson &quot;upon a stone-pillar&quot; in the middle of the &quot;exceedingly broad and handsome&quot; Sackville Street: &quot;The Post Office is on his right hand (only it is cut off); and on his left, 'Gresham's' and the 'Imperial Hotel' &quot;.{{sfn|Thackeray|1911|pp=22–23}} A few years later, the monument was a source of pride to some citizens, who dubbed it &quot;Dublin's Glory&quot;  when [[Queen Victoria]] visited the city in 1849.{{sfn|Ó Riain|1998}}

Between 1840 and 1843 [[Nelson's Column]] was erected in London's [[Trafalgar Square]]. With an overall height of {{convert|170|ft|m}} it was taller than its Dublin equivalent and, at £47,000, much more costly to erect.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=40}}{{refn|£47,000 in 1843 equates to about £5.3 million in 2016, using the GDP deflator for capital projects.{{sfn|MeasuringWorth 2016}}|group= n}} It has no internal staircase or viewing platform.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=13}} The London column was the subject of an attack during the [[Fenian dynamite campaign]] in May 1884, when a quantity of explosives was placed at its  base  but failed to detonate.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=40}}

In 1853 the queen attended the [[Great Industrial Exhibition (1853)|Dublin Great Industrial Exhibition]], where a city plan was displayed that envisaged the removal of the Pillar.{{sfn|Ó Riain|1998}} This proved impossible, as since 1811 legal responsibility for the Pillar had been vested in a trust,{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=18}} under the terms of which the trustees were required &quot;to embellish and uphold the monument in perpetuation of the object for which it was subscribed&quot;.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=47}} Any action to remove or resite the Pillar, or replace the statue, required the passage of an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] in London; [[Dublin Corporation]] (the city government) had no authority in the matter.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=37}} No action followed the city plan suggestion, but the following years saw regular attempts to remove the monument.{{sfn|Ó Riain|1998}} A proposal was made in 1876 by Alderman Peter McSwiney, a former Lord Mayor,{{sfn|Dublin City Council (Lord Mayors)}} to replace the &quot;unsightly structure&quot; with a memorial to the recently deceased [[John Gray (Irish politician)|Sir John Gray]], who had done much to provide Dublin with a clean water supply. The Corporation was unable to advance this idea.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=42}}
[[File:Nelson's Pillar porch design 1894.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Artwork of the pedestal for the Pillar, showing the Trafalgar inscription, with the architectural design for the new porch and railings|Design for the new 1894 entrance porch]]
In 1882 the Moore Street Market and Dublin City Improvement Act was passed by the Westminster parliament, overriding the trust and giving the Corporation  authority to resite the Pillar, but subject to a strict timetable, within which the city authorities found it impossible to act. The Act lapsed and the Pillar remained;{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=38}} a similar attempt, with the same result, was made in 1891.{{sfn|Ó Riain|1998}} Not all Dubliners favoured  demolition; some businesses considered the Pillar to be the city's focal point, and the tramway company petitioned for its retention as it marked the central tram terminus.{{sfn|Henchy|1948|p=61}} &quot;In many ways&quot;, says Fallon, &quot;the pillar had  become part of the fabric of the city&quot;.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=44}} Kennedy writes: &quot;A familiar and very large if rather scruffy piece of the city's furniture, it was ''The'' Pillar, Dublin's Pillar rather than Nelson's Pillar&amp;nbsp;... it was also an outing, an experience&quot;.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=41}}  The Dublin sculptor [[John Hughes (sculptor)|John Hughes]] invited students at the  Metropolitan School of Art to &quot;admire the elegance and dignity&quot; of Kirk's statue, &quot;and the beauty of the silhouette&quot;.{{sfn|Murphy|2010|p=12}}

In 1894 there were some significant alterations to the Pillar's fabric. The original entry on the west side, whereby visitors entered the pedestal by a flight of steps taking them down below street level, was replaced by a new ground level entrance on the south side, with a grand porch. The whole monument was surrounded by heavy iron railings.{{sfn|Henchy|1948|pp=56–57}}{{refn|These changes were made by Dublin architect George Palmer Beater (1850–1928).{{sfn|Dictionary of Irish Architects}} The porch, with Nelson's name over the entrance, was made from &quot;chiselled granite lined internally with white enamelled brick&quot;. [[Gilding]] was added to the incised inscriptions on the pedestal and to Nelson's name.{{sfn|archiseek: Lost Buildings of Ireland }}|group= n}} In the new century, despite the growing nationalism within Dublin—80 per cent of the Corporation's councillors were nationalists of some description—the pillar was liberally decorated with flags and streamers to mark the 1905 Trafalgar centenary.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=45–46}} The changing political atmosphere had long been signalled by the arrival in Sackville Street of further monuments, all celebrating distinctively Irish heroes, in what the historian Yvonne Whelan describes as defiance of the British Government, a &quot;challenge in stone&quot;. Between the 1860s and 1911, Nelson was joined by monuments to [[Daniel O'Connell]], [[William Smith O'Brien]] and [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], as well as Sir John Gray and the temperance campaigner [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Father Matthew]].{{sfn|Whelan|2014|p=94}} Meanwhile, in 1861, after decades of construction, the [[Wellington Monument, Dublin|Wellington Monument]] in Dublin's [[Phoenix Park]] was  completed, the foundation stone having been laid in 1817.{{sfn|Garnett|1952|pp=54 and 61}} This vast obelisk, {{convert|220|ft|m}} high and {{convert|120|ft|m}} square at the base,{{sfn|Casey|2005|p=308}} honoured [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], Dublin-born and a former [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]].{{sfn|Fallon2014|p=51}} Unlike the Pillar, Wellington's obelisk has attracted little controversy and has not been the subject of physical attacks.{{sfn|Independent.ie. 26 August 2003 }}

===Easter Rising, April 1916===
On [[Easter Monday]], 24 April 1916, units of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]] seized several prominent buildings and streets in central Dublin, including the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] (GPO) in Sackville Street, one of the buildings nearest the Pillar. They set up headquarters at the GPO where they declared an Irish Republic under a provisional government.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=53–54}} One of the first recorded actions of the [[Easter Rising]] occurred near the Pillar when [[lancer]]s from the nearby [[Marlborough Street, Dublin|Marlborough Street]] barracks, sent to investigate the disturbance, were fired on from the GPO. They withdrew in confusion, leaving four soldiers and two horses dead.{{sfn|Townshend|2006|p=184}}

During the days that followed, Sackville Street and particularly the area around the Pillar became a battleground. According to some histories, insurgents attempted to blow up the Pillar. The accounts are unconfirmed and were disputed by many that fought in the Rising,{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=55–56}} on the grounds that the Pillar's large base provided them with useful cover as they moved to and from other rebel positions.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=43–44}}  By Thursday night, British artillery fire had set much of Sackville Street ablaze, but according to the writer Peter De Rosa's account: &quot;On his pillar, Nelson surveyed it all serenely, as though he were lit up by a thousand lamps&quot;.{{sfn|De Rosa|1990|p=350}} The statue was visible against the fiery backdrop from as far as [[Killiney]], {{convert|9|mi|km}} away.{{sfn|De Rosa|1990|p=351}}

By Saturday, when the provisional government finally surrendered, many of the Sackville Street buildings between the Pillar and the Liffey had been destroyed or badly damaged, including the Imperial Hotel that Thackeray had admired.{{sfn|Townshend|2006|p=266}}{{sfn|De Rosa|1990|pp=358–59}} Of the GPO, only the façade remained; against the tide of opinion [[Bernard Shaw]] said the demolition of the city's classical architecture scarcely mattered: &quot;What does matter is the Liffey slums have not been demolished&quot;.{{sfn|Shaw|1916|p=6}}  An account in a New York newspaper reported that the Pillar had been  lost in the destruction of the street,{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=61}} but it had sustained only minor damage, chiefly bullet marks on the column and statue itself—one shot is said to have taken off Nelson's nose.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=57}}

===In an independent Ireland===
After the [[Irish War of Independence|Anglo-Irish war of 1919–21]] and the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|treaty]] that followed, Ireland was partitioned; Dublin became the capital of the [[Irish Free State]], a [[Dominion]] within the [[British Commonwealth of Nations]].{{sfn|&quot;The Partition of Ireland&quot;}} From December 1922, when the Free State was inaugurated, the Pillar became an issue for the Irish rather than the British government. In 1923, when Sackville Street was again in ruins during the [[Irish Civil War]],{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=65}} ''The Irish Builder and Engineer'' magazine called the original siting of the Pillar a &quot;blunder&quot; and asked for its removal,{{sfn|''The Irish Builder and Engineer'' 30 June 1923|p=497}} a view echoed by the Dublin Citizens Association.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=44–45}}  The poet [[William Butler Yeats]], who had become a member of the [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Irish Senate]], favoured its re-erection elsewhere, but thought it should not, as some wished, be destroyed, because  &quot;the life and work of the people who built it are part of our tradition.&quot;{{sfn|Ó Riain |1998}}

Sackville Street was renamed O'Connell Street in 1924.{{sfn|Casey|2005|p=212}}{{refn|The change had first been proposed by Dublin Corporation in 1884, but had been rejected at the time by the street's residents.{{sfn|Casey|2005|p=212}} |group= n}}  The following year the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] and the Dublin Civic Survey  demanded legislation to allow the Pillar's removal, without success.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=44–45}}  Pressure continued, and in 1926 ''The Manchester Guardian'' reported that the Pillar was to be taken down, &quot;as it was a hindrance to modern traffic&quot;.{{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian'' 26 March 1926|p=9}} Requests for action—removal, destruction or the replacement of the statue with that of an Irish hero—continued up to the Second World War and beyond; the main stumbling blocks remained the trustees' strict interpretation of the terms of the trust, and the unwillingness of successive Irish governments to take legislative action.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=44–45}}{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=68–69, 71–72}}  In 1936 the magazine of the ultra-nationalist [[Blueshirts]] movement remarked that this inactivity showed a failure in the national spirit: &quot;The conqueror is gone, but the scars which he left remain, and the victim will not even try to remove them&quot;.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=70–71, quoting from ''The Blueshirt'', 1 March 1935}}
{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align= right|quote= &quot;Man and boy I have lived in Dublin, on and off, for 68 years. When I was a young fellow we didn't talk about Nelson's Column or Nelson's Pillar, we spoke of the Pillar, and everyone knew what we meant&quot;. |salign = left|source=Thomas Bodkin, 1955{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=77}}   }}
By 1949 the Irish Free State had evolved into the [[Republic of Ireland]] and left the British Commonwealth,{{sfn|De Rosa|1990|p=505}} but not all Irish opinion favoured the removal of the Pillar. That year the architectural historian [[John Harvey (historian)|John Harvey]] called it &quot;a grand work&quot;, and argued that without it, &quot;O'Connell Street would lose much of its vitality&quot;.{{sfn|Harvey|1949|p=31}} Most of the pressure to get rid of it, he said, came from &quot;traffic maniacs who&amp;nbsp;... fail to visualise the chaos which would result from creating a through current of traffic at this point&quot;.{{sfn|Harvey|1949|p=31}} In a 1955 radio broadcast [[Thomas Bodkin]], former director of the [[National Gallery of Ireland]], praised not only the monument, but Nelson himself: &quot;He was a man of extraordinary gallantry. He lost his eye fighting bravely, and his arm in a similar fashion&quot;.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=77}}

On 29 October 1955, a group of nine students from [[University College Dublin]] obtained keys from the Pillar's custodian and locked themselves inside, with an assortment of equipment including [[flamethrower|flame thrower]]s. From the gallery they hung a poster of [[Kevin Barry]], a Dublin [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) volunteer executed by the British during the War of Independence. A crowd gathered below, and began to sing the [[Irish rebel music|Irish rebel]] song &quot;[[Kevin Barry (song)|Kevin Barry]]&quot;. Eventually members of the [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] (Irish police) broke into the Pillar and ended the demonstration. No action was taken against the students, whose principal purpose, the Gardaí claimed, was publicity.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=87–89}}

In 1956, members of the [[Fianna Fáil]] party, then in opposition, proposed that the statue be replaced by one of [[Robert Emmet]], Protestant leader of [[Irish Rebellion of 1803|an abortive rebellion in 1803]]. They thought that such a gesture  might inspire Protestants in [[Northern Ireland]] to fight for a reunited Ireland.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=72}} In the North the possibility of dismantling and re-erecting the monument in [[Belfast]] was raised in the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Stormont parliament]], but the initiative failed to gain the support of the  Northern Ireland government.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=74–75}}

In 1959 a new Fianna Fáil government under [[Seán Lemass]] deferred the question of the Pillar's removal on the grounds of cost; five years later Lemass agreed to  &quot;look at&quot; the question of replacing Nelson's statue with one of [[Patrick Pearse]], the leader of the Easter Rising, in time for the 50th anniversary  of the  Rising in 1966.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=47–48}} An offer from the Irish-born American trade union leader [[Mike Quill]] to finance the removal of the Pillar was not taken up, and as the anniversary approached, Nelson remained in place.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=74–75}}

==Destruction==
[[File:Nelson's Pillar destroyed.jpg |thumb|alt=Half-destroyed Pillar with top part and statue missing|The pillar on the morning of 8 March 1966]]
Shortly after 1:30 on the morning of 8 March 1966, a powerful explosion destroyed the upper portion of the Pillar and brought Nelson's statue crashing to the ground amid hundreds of tons of rubble.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=50–51}} O'Connell Street was almost deserted at the time, although a dance in the nearby [[Hotel Metropole, Dublin|Hotel Metropole]]'s ballroom was about to end and bring crowds on to the street.{{sfn|Ó Riain |1998}} There were no casualties—a taxi-driver parked close by had a narrow escape—and damage to property was relatively light given the strength of the blast.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=94}} What was left of the Pillar was a jagged stump, {{convert|70|ft|m}} high.{{sfn|Ó Riain |1998}}

In the first government response to the action the [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Justice minister]], [[Brian Lenihan, Snr|Brian Lenihan]], condemned what he described as &quot;an outrage which was planned and committed without any regard to the lives of the citizens&quot;.{{sfn|''The Irish Times'' 9 March 1966}}  This response was considered &quot;tepid&quot; by ''The Irish Times'', whose editorial deemed the attack &quot;a direct blow to the prestige of the state and the authority of the government&quot;.{{sfn|''The Irish Times'' 9 March 1966}}  Kennedy suggests that government anger was mainly directed at what they considered a distraction from the official 50th anniversary celebrations of the Rising.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|pp=50–51}}
{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align= left|quote= &quot;There was an air of inevitability about Horatio Nelson's eventual demise; King William of Orange, King George II and Viscount Gough in the Phoenix Park had all fallen victim to republican bombings, while Queen Victoria had been rather unceremoniously dumped from her vantage point in Leinster House, removed on her back through the front gates.&quot;  |salign = left|source= Donal Fallon: &quot;Dispelling the myths about the bombing of Nelson's Pillar&quot;{{sfn|Fallon|2016}} }}
The absence of the pillar was regretted by some who felt the city had lost one of its most prominent landmarks. The Irish Literary Association was anxious that, whatever future steps were taken, the lettering on the pedestal should be preserved; the ''[[Irish Times]]'' reported that the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] was considering legal measures to prevent removal of the remaining stump.{{sfn|Ó Riain |1998}} Reactions among the general public were relatively light-hearted, typified by the numerous songs inspired by the incident. These included the immensely popular &quot;[[Up Went Nelson]]&quot;, set to the tune of &quot;[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]&quot; and performed by a group of Belfast schoolteachers, which remained at the top of the Irish charts for eight weeks.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=114–16}}  An American newspaper reported that the mood in the city was one of gaiety, with shouts of &quot;Nelson has lost his last battle!&quot;{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=96}} Some accounts relate that the [[President of Ireland|Irish president]], [[Éamon de Valera]], phoned ''[[The Irish Press]]'' to suggest the headline: &quot;British Admiral Leaves Dublin By Air&quot;{{sfn|Fleming|2016}}—according to the senator and presidential candidate [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]], &quot;the only recorded instance of humour in that lugubrious figure&quot;.{{sfn|O'Riordan|2016}}

The Pillar's fate was sealed when Dublin Corporation issued a &quot;dangerous building&quot; notice.  The trustees agreed that the stump should be removed.{{sfn|Ó Riain |1998}}  A last-minute request by the [[Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland]] for an injunction to delay the demolition on planning grounds was rejected by Justice [[Thomas Teevan (attorney general)|Thomas Teevan]].{{sfn|''The Guardian'' 15 March 1966}} On 14 March the Army destroyed the stump by a controlled explosion, watched at a safe distance by a crowd  who, the press reported, &quot;raised a resounding cheer&quot;.{{sfn|''The Irish Times'' 14 March 1966}} There was a scramble for souvenirs, and many parts of the stonework were taken from the scene. Some of these relics, including Nelson's head, eventually found their way into museums;{{refn|About ten days after the initial explosion Nelson's head was stolen from a corporation yard by students from the [[National College of Art and Design]], as a fund-raising stunt. The head was exhibited, for a fee, at various locations including stage performance by [[The Dubliners]] and [[The Clancy Brothers]]. It crossed the Irish Sea, and was rented for display in a London antique shop. It was returned to Ireland in September 1966, ultimately finding a home in the Dublin City Library and Archive in [[Pearse Street]].{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=107–11}}{{sfn|Fleming|2016}} |group= n}}  parts of the lettered stonework from the pedestal are displayed in the grounds of the [[Butler House, Kilkenny|Butler House]] hotel in [[Kilkenny]], while smaller remnants were used to decorate private gardens.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=106–13}} Contemporary and subsequent accounts record that the army's explosion caused  more damage than the first, but this, Fallon says, is a myth; damage claims arising from the second explosion amounted to less than a quarter of the sum claimed as a result of the original blast.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=99}}{{sfn|&quot;A colonel writes...&quot; 19 March 2006}}

==Aftermath==

===Investigations===
It was initially assumed that the monument was destroyed by the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–69)|IRA]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported on 9 March that six men had been arrested and questioned, but their identities were not revealed and there were no  charges.{{sfn|''The Guardian'' 9 March 1966}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=52}} An IRA spokesman denied involvement, stating that they had no interest in demolishing mere symbols of foreign domination: &quot;We are interested in the destruction of the domination itself&quot;.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=100 (quoted from ''[[The Irish Independent]]'', 9 March 1966)}} In the absence of any leads, rumours suggested that the [[ETA (separatist group)|Basque separatist movement ETA]] might be responsible, perhaps as part of a training exercise with an Irish republican splinter group; in the mid-1960s the explosives expertise of ETA was generally acknowledged.{{sfn|Myles|2009|p=312}}

No further information was forthcoming until 2000, when during a [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] interview a former IRA member, Liam Sutcliffe claimed he had placed the bomb which detonated in the Pillar.{{sfn|Fleming|2016}}{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=101–03}} In the 1950s  Sutcliffe was associated with a group of dissident volunteers led by Joe Christle (1927–98), who had been expelled from the IRA in 1956 for &quot;recklessness&quot;.{{sfn|White|2009}}  In early 1966 Sutcliffe learned that Christle's group was planning &quot;Operation Humpty Dumpty&quot;, an attack on the Pillar, and offered his services. According to Sutcliffe, on 28 February he placed a bomb within the Pillar, timed to go off in the early hours of the next morning.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=101–03}} The explosive was a mixture of [[gelignite]] and [[ammonal]].{{sfn|Fleming|2016}} It failed to detonate; Sutcliffe says that he returned early the next morning, recovered the device and redesigned its timer. On 7 March, shortly before the Pillar closed for the day, he climbed the inner stairway and placed the refurbished bomb near to the top of the shaft before going home.  He learned of the success of his mission the next day, he says, having slept undisturbed through the night.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=101–03}} Following his revelations, Sutcliffe was questioned by the police but not charged. He did not name  others involved in the action, apart from Christle and his brother.{{sfn|Fleming|2016}}

===Replacements===
On 29 April 1969 the Irish parliament passed the Nelson Pillar Act, terminating the Pillar Trust and vesting ownership of the site in Dublin Corporation. The trustees received £21,170 in compensation for the Pillar's destruction, and a further sum for loss of income.{{sfn|Nelson Pillar Act, 1969}} In the debate, Senator [[Owen Sheehy-Skeffington]] argued that the Pillar had been capable of repair and should have been re-assembled and rebuilt.{{sfn|Seanad Éireann Debate 23 April 1969}}
[[File:The Spire, Dublin.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Tall pole rising high into the sky above buildings lining a city centre shopping street|The Spire of Dublin, erected in 2003, viewed from [[Henry Street, Dublin|Henry Street]]]]
For more than twenty years the site stood empty, while various campaigns sought to fill the space. In 1970 the Arthur Griffith Society suggested a monument to [[Arthur Griffith]], founder of [[Sinn Féin]], and Pearse, whose centenary would fall in 1979, was the subject of several proposals. None of these schemes were accepted by the Corporation. A request in 1987 by the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission that the Pillar be rebuilt—with a different statue—was likewise rejected.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=118–19}} In 1988, as part of the city's 1,000th anniversary celebrations, the Smurfit Millennium Fountain was erected close to the site. This was commissioned  by a Dublin businessman Michael Smurfit in memory of his father; it incorporated a bronze statue of a woman, sculpted by [[Éamonn O'Doherty (sculptor)|Éamonn O'Doherty]]. The monument, known colloquially as the [[Anna Livia (monument)|Anna Livia]], was not universally appreciated; O'Doherty's fellow-sculptor [[Edward Delaney]] called it an &quot;atrocious eyesore&quot;.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|p=120}}{{refn|A popular name for the Anna Livia was &quot;the floozie in the jacuzzi&quot;. In 2001, during regeneration work in O'Connell Street, the fountain was demolished and the statue removed, eventually to be re-sited in the Croppies Acre Memorial Park.{{sfn|Dublin City Council Press Statement September 2011}}{{sfn|TheJournal.ie 25 February 2011}} |group= n}}

1988 saw the launch of the Pillar Project, aimed at encouraging artists and architects to bring forward new ideas for an appropriate permanent memorial to replace Nelson. Suggestions included a {{convert|110|m|ft}} flagpole, a triumphal arch modelled on the Paris [[Arc de Triomphe]], and a &quot;Tower of Light&quot; with a platform that would restore Nelson's view over the city.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=120–22}} In 1997 Dublin Corporation announced a formal design competition for a monument  to mark the new millennium in 2000. The winning entry was [[Ian Ritchie (architect)|Ian Ritchie]]'s [[Spire of Dublin]], a plain, needle-like structure rising {{convert|120|m|ft}} from the street.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=53}} The design was approved; on 22 January 2003 it was completed, despite some political and artistic opposition.  During the excavations preceding the Spire's construction, the foundation stone of the Nelson Pillar was recovered.  Press stories that a time capsule containing valuable coins had also been discovered fascinated the public for a while, but proved illusory.{{sfn|Fallon|2014|pp=124–26}}
