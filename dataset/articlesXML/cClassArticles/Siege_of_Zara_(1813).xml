The '''Siege of [[Zadar]]''' also known as the '''Blockade of Zadar''' ({{lang-it|Zara}}) (at the time known as '''Siege of Zara''') was a military event that took place during the [[Adriatic campaign of 1807–14|Adriatic Campaign]] as part of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] between 22 November  to 5 December 1813.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOON&quot;&gt;[http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=1092 HMS Havannah], ''Ships of the Old Navy'', Retrieved 15 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An Anglo-Austrian force under overall command of [[George Cadogan, 3rd Earl Cadogan|George Cadogan]] in [[HMS Havannah (1811)|HMS ''Havannah'']] blockaded and bombarded [[Zadar]] which was held by a French garrison and within two weeks the place surrendered.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOTON&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Michael|title=HAVANNAH (36)|url=http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=1092|website=Age of Nelson - Ships of the Old Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] with the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1809 had solidified French influence in the Adriatic by formalising their control of the [[Illyrian Provinces]] on the Eastern shore.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG153&quot;&gt;Gardiner, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Vis/Lissa]] in March 1811 however, the Royal Navy had achieved dominance over the French in the Adriatic Sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG174&quot;&gt;Gardiner, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Austria declared war on France in August 1813 and working in conjunction with the Austrian armies now invading the Illyrian Provinces and Northern [[Italy]], Rear Admiral [[Thomas Fremantle (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Fremantle's]] ships were able to rapidly transport British and Austrian troops from one point to another, forcing the surrender of the strategic ports.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ6:257&quot;&gt;James, Vol. 6, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1813, [[HMS Havannah (1811)|HMS ''Havannah'']] was attached to [[Thomas Fremantle (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Fremantles]] squadron that had successfully blockaded and besieged [[Trieste]]. She was then detached to take the port of Zara with the assistance of {{HMS|Weazel|1805|2}}. Zara was a regular fortification with 110 pieces of brass cannon, seven mortars and eleven mounted howitzers manned by a garrison of 2,000 troops,  nearly half of them [[Croats|Croatian]] commanded by an experienced French general, Baron Roize.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOTON&quot;/&gt;

==Siege==
When they arrived on 22nd November they found that the fortress was well supplied and ready to stand a long siege, so Cadogan determined to blockade and to eventually attack the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=122|issue=16843|date=11 January 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadogan intended to use the ships' guns to establish batteries on the shore with British seaman and [[Royal Marines]] to make up the force to arm them. They were to combine with the land blockading Austrian force which numbered 1,500 men under [[Franz Xaver Freiherr Von Tomassich]] who had contributed two [[howitzer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;N&amp;M&quot;/&gt; Lieutenant William Hamley with a force of sixty men were given the job of setting up batteries. Assisting him were two lieutenants and a master's mates of ''Havannah''. With two 32-pounder [[carronade]]s, eight [[18-pounder long gun|eighteen pounder guns]] and seven [[12-pounder long gun|long twelve pounder]] guns, together with all the necessary powder and ammunition, were landed from ''Havannah'' and ''Weazel''. They dragged them on sledges across swamps and ditches at night, a distance of about three miles before establishment. The [[Union Jack]] was hoisted on each of three batteries on 23 November and they started a bombardment in almost incessant rain.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOTON&quot;/&gt;

Twelve [[gunboat]]s, each carrying a long [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounder]] and one smaller gun were moored under the walls. The French fire from these inflicted some damage on the British and Austrian defences at first and [[sandbag]]s were continually needed to fill the few entrenchments. On December 1st one long 18-pounder and the carronades were redirected to deal with the French gunboats and, after an hour and a half, not one remained afloat.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOTON&quot;/&gt;

In the garrison a [[mutiny]] broke out amongst the Croat battalions in Rosie's force. This was put down by Rosie but instead they escaped the fortress and gave themselves up to the Austrians and British troops waiting outside. This number constituted nearly two thirds of Rosie's garrison leaving just 800 men left.&lt;ref name=&quot;N&amp;M&quot;/&gt;

On 6 December, after thirteen days and nights of bombardment in when the batteries had only one round of shot left, Rosie sent out a [[flag of truce]] and capitulated.

==Aftermath==
Cadogan and Tomassich laid out the terms to Rosie; the French would be allowed to return to Italy but not to engage in combat unless they were exchanged. Once the surrender terms were agreed the French marched out and the British and Austrians entered Zara.&lt;ref name=&quot;N&amp;M&quot;/&gt;

In all, the British and Austrians had captured 110 guns and 18 howitzers, 350 men as well as 100 dismounted guns and twelve salvageable gunboats.&lt;ref name=LG16888&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16888|startpage=858|date= 23 April 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they were about to leave for Trieste Cadogan was later instructed to hand over all prizes and spoils of war to the Austrians. (This order cost the crews of ''Havannah'' and ''Weazel'' an estimated £300,000 in prize money.) The [[Emperor of Austria]], [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] however, awarded Lieutenant William Hamley the Imperial Austrian [[Order of Leopold (Austria)|Order of Leopold]] for his services at Zara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debrett|first1=John|title=The Baronetage of England Volume 2|date=1819|publisher=F.C. and J. Rivington|page=1387|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FPFRAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, one by one most towns in the Illyrian Provinces fell to Anglo-Austrian forces. [[Siege of Cattaro|Cattaro fell]] the same month and in January 1814 [[Siege of Ragusa|Ragussa fell]]. By the end of March 1814 all towns and cities had surrendered to the British or the allied rebels that had risen in revolt, leaving the Adriatic in complete allied control with the exception of [[Corfu]]. Zara was restored to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] of the [[Austrian Empire]] by the [[Congress of Vienna]].
