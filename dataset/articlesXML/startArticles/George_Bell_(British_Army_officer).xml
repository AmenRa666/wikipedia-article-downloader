'''Sir George Bell''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] (17 March 1794 – 10 July 1877) was an officer in the [[British Army]]. He served during the [[Peninsular War]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]], the [[Rebellions of 1837]] in Canada, and the [[Crimean War]]. During the Crimean War he saw action at the [[Battle of Alma|battles of Alma]] and [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]], and at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Siege of Sevastopol]].

== Early life and the Peninsula War ==
Bell was the son of George Bell, of Belle Vue, on [[Lough Erne]], [[Fermanagh]], by Catherine, daughter of [[Dominick Nugent]], M.P., was born at Belle Vue, 17 March 1794, and whilst yet at school in [[Dublin]] was gazetted an ensign in the [[34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot|34th Regiment of Foot]] on 11 March 1811.{{sfn|Boase|1885|pp=157–158}}

Bell went to Portugal with his regiment to fight under the [[Duke of Wellington]] in the Peninsula War. He carried the colours of his regiment for the first time in the [[Battle of Arroyo dos Molinos|action of Arroyo-de-Molinos]]; was present at the second and final [[Second Siege of Badajoz (1811)|Siege of Badajoz]], and in the majority of the [[Peninsula War#Invasion of France|celebrated actions]] which intervened between that time and the [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Battle of Toulouse]]. On being gazetted to the [[45th Regiment of Foot]] in 1825 he proceeded to India, and was present in [[Inwa|Ava]] during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]].{{sfn|Boase|1885|p=158}}

==Canada==
Bell was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in 1828, and in 1836 was in Canada, where he was actively employed during the [[Rebellions of 1837|rebellion of 1837-1838]]. He commanded the fort and garrison of [[Coteau-du-Lac, Quebec|Coteau-du-Lac]], an important position on the [[Saint Lawrence River]], and received the thanks of the commander of the forces and his brevet-[[Major (United Kingdom)|majority]], 29 March 1839, for his exertions in recovering the guns of the fort, which had been sunk in the river, unspiking and mounting them in position, when it had been reported to be impossible to do so. The guns were 24-pounders, sixteen of which, with 4,000 round shot, he recovered from the deep in the middle of a Canadian winter.{{sfn|Boase|1885|p=158}}

==Crimea==
On becoming [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]] of the [[Royal Scots|1st Foot]], known as the Royal Regiment, 5 December 1843, Bell next served in [[Gibraltar]], [[Nova Scotia]], the [[West Indies]], the [[Mediterranean]], and [[Turkey]], after which he landed with the allied armies during the [[Crimea War]], and was present at the [[Battle of Alma|battles of Alma]] and [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]], and in the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Siege of Sevastopol]], where he was wounded and honourably [[Mentioned in dispatches|mentioned in a despatch]] from [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], who appointed him to the command of a brigade.{{sfn|Boase|1885|p=158}}

==Later life==
On his return to England Bell was made a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Bath]] on 5 July 1855, and took up his residence at [[Liverpool]] as inspecting field officer until 1859, when he became a [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|major-general]] in the army. He was in the Royal Regiment for the long period of thirty years. From this time onwards he never obtained any further employment, the reason being, as he fully believed, a letter which he wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' on 12 December 1854, complaining of the deficiencies of the commissariat in the siege of Sevastopol, and soliciting help from the people of England. On 23 October 1863 he was appointed colonel of the [[104th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Fusiliers)|104th Foot]]; he became colonel of the [[32nd (Cornwall) Regiment of Foot|32nd Foot]] on 2 February 1867, and colonel of the 1st Foot on 3 August 1868.{{sfn|Boase|1885|p=158}}

Bell was created a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Bath]] on 13 March 1867; a [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]] on 28 January 1868; and a [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] on 8 March 1873. He died at 156 Westbourne Terrace, London on 10 July 1877 and is buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in London.{{sfn|Boase|1885|p=158}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir George Bell|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=21819325|work=Find a Grave|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Bell's work, in two volumes, entitled ''Rough Notes By An Old Soldier: During Fifty Years' Service, From Ensign G. B. To Major-General C. B.'', a gossiping and amusing account of his life and services, was published early in 1867.{{sfn|Boase|1885|p=158}}

== Family ==
Bell had been twice married, the first time to Alicia, daughter and heiress of James Scott, of Ecclesjohn and Commiston, N.B., and secondly, in 1820, to Margaret Addison, a daughter of Thomas Dougal, of Scotland, banker.{{sfn|Boase|1885|p=158}} His brother was [[Henry Nugent Bell]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
