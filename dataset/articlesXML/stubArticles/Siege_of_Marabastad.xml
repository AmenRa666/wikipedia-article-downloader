{{Campaignbox First Boer War}}

The '''Siege of Marabastad''' was a siege on Fort [[Marabastad, Pretoria|Marabastad]], present day [[South Africa]], carried out by the [[Boer Republics|Boer Republic]] of [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], starting on 11 January 1881, and ending with British surrender on 2 April 1881.&lt;ref name=&quot;End of siege&quot;/&gt; It took place during the [[First Boer War]], in which Boers besieged several British garrisons across the country.

==Background==

In early 1880, British forces in Transvaal decided to build a fort in the city, due to its remoteness from other British South African forts, with it being {{convert|165|miles}} from Pretoria. Marabastad and the [[Zoutpansberg]] district had a population of 300,000–400,000 natives, along with an additional 175,000 in Waterberg. A fort was needed to control the large native population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Transvaal War, 1880-81|date=1885|page=285|author=Lady Bellairs|accessdate=6 April 2014|url=https://archive.org/details/transvaalwar00belliala|quote=In the early part of 1880 it was decided to create a military station in this far-away region - 165 miles from Pretoria - for the purpose of asserting the supremacy of the Government, and overswing the surrounding large native population, - estimated at between 300,000 and 400,000 in the Zoutpansberg, and about half that number in the Waterberg district.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1880, two detachments of the 94th Regiment, under Captain Campbell, reached Marabastad, the first British forces to reach this part of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Transvaal War, 1880-81|date=1885|page=285|author=Lady Bellairs|accessdate=6 April 2014|url=https://archive.org/details/transvaalwar00belliala|quote=Captain Campbell, with two companies of the 94th Regiment - the first British troops which had been through that part of the province - reached the place in February.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within three months, the fort had been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Transvaal War, 1880-81|date=1885|page=285|author=Lady Bellairs|accessdate=6 April 2014|url=https://archive.org/details/transvaalwar00belliala|quote=The station was inspected about three months later by Major-General Hon. H. H. Clifford, but no alteration was apparently deemed necessary;...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 1880, Captain Campbell was ordered to march to Pretoria. He, along with a company of 60 men, left for the city, leaving behind a company of 60 men in Marabastad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Transvaal War, 1880-81|date=1885|page=285|author=Lady Bellairs|accessdate=6 April 2014|url=https://archive.org/details/transvaalwar00belliala|quote=On the afternoon of the 29th November, a special messenger arrived from Pretoria, with orders of one company, under Captain Campbell, to march at once, as light as possible, to be stationed, as a temporary measure. at Pretoria. Within a few hours Captain Campbell was on the road, with about 60 men and a mule-waggon;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell left Captain E.S. Brooks in command, along with Lieutenant F.G.W. Jones and Surgeon Harding, A.M.D..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Transvaal War, 1880-81|date=1885|page=285|author=Lady Bellairs|accessdate=6 April 2014|url=https://archive.org/details/transvaalwar00belliala|quote=The garrison now left consisted of only about 60 men, under the command of Captain E.S. Brook, with two other officers - Lieutenant F.G.W. Jones, and Surgeon Harding, A.M.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations for the siege==

Following the [[Battle of Bronkhorstspruit|Bronkhorstspruit Disaster]] on 20 December, Lieutenant Jones received commands to prepare for siege. Captain Brooks immediately begun preparations. He expanded his army, recruiting 30 English volunteers. They were joined by 50 South African Natives from the Transvaal Mounted Police, commanded by Captain Thompson and Lieutenant Gleniston, which had marched forty miles south from Wood-Bush.

In December, a trench of 25 square yards was dug around the fort. Supplies of food and ammunition were stored and corn seized from the natives.

==Siege==
In January, the Boers approached Marabastad. They were divided into two laagers - one at Sand Spruit and one and Botha's Farm. On 11 January, Commandant Barend Vorster of the Boers requested Captain Brook to stop taking corn from the city, effectively beginning the siege. On 19 January, a British patrol of 15 Transvaal Mounted Police under Thompson and ten volunteers were sent to scout the Boers at Sand Spruit. They were unexpectedly attacked and defeated by a larger force, leaving one policeman dead and two wounded, along with two volunteers wounded. The Boers also suffered several men injured. They quickly retreated to the fort, with the two policemen being captured prisoner. Following this engagement, Vorster requested Captain Brook to surrender, but also told Brook that he would not attack the British as long as no more scouts took place. Despite this reassurance, Boers slowly patrolled closer to the British fort.
