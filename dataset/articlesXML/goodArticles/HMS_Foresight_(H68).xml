'''HMS ''Foresight''''' was one of nine [[E and F-class destroyer|F-class destroyer]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the 1930s. She was assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] upon completion. Unlike her sister ships, she does not appear to have been attached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in 1935–36 during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], nor did she enforce the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–1939. The ship escorted the larger ships of the fleet during the early stages of World War II and played a minor role in the [[Norwegian Campaign]] of 1940. ''Foresight'' was sent to [[Gibraltar]] in mid-1940 and formed part of [[Force H]] where she participated in the [[attack on Mers-el-Kébir]] and the [[Battle of Dakar]]. The ship escorted numerous [[Malta convoys|convoys to Malta]] in 1941 and [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] during 1942. Later that year, ''Foresight'' participated in [[Operation Pedestal]], another convoy to Malta. She was torpedoed by an Italian aircraft on 12 August and had to be [[scuttled]] the next day.

==Description==
The F-class ships were repeats of the preceding [[E and F-class destroyer|E-class destroyers]]. They displaced {{convert|1405|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1940|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|329|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|3|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|6|in|m|1}}. They were powered by two [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]], using steam provided by three [[Admiralty three-drum boiler]]s. The turbines developed a total of {{convert|36000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|35.5|kn|lk=in}}. ''Foresight'' carried a maximum of {{convert|470|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|6350|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}. The ships' complement was 145 officers and [[Naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=l6&gt;Lenton, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships mounted four [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch (120&amp;nbsp;mm) Mark IX guns]] in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' in sequence from front to rear. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.5&amp;nbsp;inch Vickers Mark III]] [[machine gun]]. The F class was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; One [[depth charge]] rack and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 38 shortly after the war began.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime modifications===
Between October 1940 and April 1941, ''Foresight'' had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] [[AA gun]]. Around this time, she probably had two single [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{convert|20|mm|1|abbr=on}} Oerlikon]] light AA guns installed abreast the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 241, 243&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1942, a [[Type 286 radar|Type 286]] short-range surface search radar was fitted as was a [[HF/DF]] [[radio direction finder]] mounted on a pole [[mainmast]].&lt;ref name=l6/&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Foresight'' was ordered on 17 March 1933 from [[Cammell Laird]] and was [[laid down]] at their [[Birkenhead]] shipyard on 31 July, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 29 June 1934, and completed on 15 May 1935. The ship cost 245,428 [[Pound sterling|pounds]], excluding government-furnished equipment such as the armament. All of the F-class destroyers were assigned to the [[6th Destroyer Flotilla]] (DF) of the Home Fleet, and, ''Foresight'', unlike her sisters, did not leave home waters during the 1930s. The 6th DF was renumbered the [[8th Destroyer Flotilla]] in April 1939, and ''Foresight'' remained assigned to it until July 1940. World War II began in September and she was tasked to escort the larger ships of the fleet during this time.&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 75–76, 80&lt;/ref&gt; She played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Haarr, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June, the 8th DF was ordered to [[Gibraltar]] where they were to form the escorts for Force H.&lt;ref name=e0&gt;English, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, they participated in the [[attack on Mers-el-Kébir]] against the [[Vichy French]] ships stationed there.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September, Force H rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture [[Dakar]] from the Vichy French. Ten days later, they attacked Dakar where ''Foresight'' and the destroyer {{HMS|Inglefield|D02|2}} sank the {{ship|French submarine|Persée}}&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, pp. 38, 42&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Foresight'' sank the submarine {{ship|French submarine|Bévéziers|Q179|2}} on the 25th. She returned home for a refit after the battle and was damaged by a near-miss during a German air raid on [[Liverpool]] on the night of 21/22 December.&lt;ref name=e0/&gt;

On 31 January 1941, Force H, including ''Foresight'', departed Gibraltar to carry out [[Operation Picket]], an unsuccessful night torpedo attack by eight of ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s [[Fairey Swordfish]] on the [[Tirso Dam]] in [[Sardinia]]. The British ships returned to Gibraltar on 4 February and began preparing for [[Operation Grog]], a naval bombardment of [[Genoa]], that was successfully carried out five days later.&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, ''Foresight'' escorted the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} as she flew off aircraft for [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|the beleaguered island of Malta]] near [[Sicily]] on 3 April and again on the 27th. The following month she was part of the escort screen, with five other destroyers, for the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|2}} and the [[light cruiser]]s {{HMS|Naiad|93|2}}, {{HMS|Fiji|58|2}} and {{HMS|Gloucester|62|2}} which were joining the Mediterranean Fleet. This was part of [[Malta Convoys|Operation Tiger]] which included a supply convoy taking tanks to Egypt and the transfer of warships to and from the Mediterranean Fleet. ''Foresight'' and her sisters had their Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeping gear]] rigged to allow them to serve as fast minesweepers en route to Malta. Despite this, one merchant ship was sunk by [[naval mine|mines]] and another damaged. Later that month, she escorted the [[capital ship]]s of Force H as they searched for the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck}} and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} in the North Atlantic after the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]] on 23 May. ''Foresight'' escorted another flying-off mission to Malta on 14 June; two days later, after German [[blockade runner]]s reached France, Force H [[sortie]]d into the Atlantic on a failed search for more blockade runners. Together with her sisters {{HMS|Faulknor|H62|2}}, {{HMS|Fearless|H67|2}}, {{HMS|Forester|H74|2}} and {{HMS|Foxhound|H69|2}}, ''Foresight'' helped to sink the {{GS|U-138|1940|6}} on 18 June. The ship participated in another Malta convoy in late July, during which she had to scuttle her sister ''Fearless'', after she had been crippled by an airborne torpedo on 23 July. ''Foresight'' continued to escort the ships of Force H until October, after she participated in another convoy to Malta, [[Operation Halberd]]. During this operation, the ship again served as a fast minesweeper, albeit more successfully than the last time she had done so.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 81; Rohwer, pp. 67, 70, 72, 74, 77, 88–89, 94, 103–04&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th DF returned to Britain after Halberd and resumed their previous task of escorting the ships of Home Fleet for the next six months. In early April 1942, ''Foresight'', ''Forester'' and the light cruiser {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|2}} were part of the close escort for [[Convoy PQ 14]], bound for [[Murmansk]]. The trio were then the close escort for [[Convoy QP 11]], returning from Murmansk to Iceland, when ''Edinburgh'' was torpedoed on 29 April. The two hits disabled her steering and she had to be towed by the sisters. Two days later, they were attacked by three German destroyers which badly damaged the two destroyers and put another torpedo into ''Edinburgh'', crippling her. ''Foresight'' had eight men killed and eleven wounded during the battle. The two destroyers took off the survivors from the cruiser and ''Foresight'' scuttled the cruiser with a torpedo. Temporarily repaired at Murmansk, the sisters were part of the light cruiser {{HMS|Trinidad|46|2}}'s escort home in May. She had to be scuttled on 15 May by the destroyer {{HMS|Matchless|G52|2}} after she was set on fire by a German bomber. ''Foresight'' spent June under repair.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 81; Rohwer, pp. 158, 162, 165–66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS Foresight sunk by HMS Tartar.jpg|thumb|left|''Foresight'' being [[scuttled]] by ''Tartar''{{'}}s torpedoes]]
''Foresight'' was assigned to the convoy escort force for Operation Pedestal, a heavily escorted convoy to Malta in August. On the 12th, she was torpedoed by an Italian [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] bomber at 18:45; the hit broke her [[Keel|back]], knocked out her steering, and killed one officer and three ratings. By the time the destroyer {{HMS|Tartar|F43|6}} arrived, ''Foresight'' could only steam at {{convert|2|kn|spell=in}} and a towline was secured by 19:30. Shortly afterwards, the towing wire fouled ''Tartar''{{'}}s starboard propeller; another wire was rigged by 20:40, but it had to be slipped when an unknown force of one cruiser and two destroyers was spotted at close range. Around 22:30, ''Foresight'' was secured alongside ''Tartar'' until 05:15 the following day when the cables snapped. Another tow wire was rigged at 06:10, but it was dropped when a submarine [[periscope]] was spotted at 09:30 and ''Tartar'' dropped depth charges as a precautionary measure even though her ASDIC had not detected any submarines. Around that same time several Axis shadowing aircraft were seen and ''Tartar''{{'}}s commander thought the likelihood of attack was now too high to proceed. He took off the 181 surviving crew and scuttled ''Foresight'' with torpedoes at 09:55&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 81–82; Evans, pp. 131–33&lt;/ref&gt; at coordinates ({{coord|37|40|N|10|00|W|display=inline,title}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ships/4387.html |title=HMS Foresight (H 68): Destroyer of the F class |publisher=Uboat.net |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
