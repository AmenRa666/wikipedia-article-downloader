'''''Imperator Alexandr III''''' ({{lang-ru|Император Александр III}}) was a {{sclass-|Borodino|battleship}} built for the [[Russian Imperial Navy]] in the first decade of the 20th century. The design of the ''Borodino'' class was derived from that of the French-designed battleship {{ship|Russian battleship |Tsesarevich||2}}. The ship was completed a few months before the start of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in February 1904 and was assigned to the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Second Pacific Squadron]] sent to the [[Far East]] six months later to break the Japanese blockade of [[Lüshunkou District|Port Arthur]]. The Japanese captured the port while the squadron was in transit and their destination was changed to [[Vladivostok]]. During the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in May 1905, ''Imperator Alexandr III'' was sunk by Japanese gunfire with the loss of her entire crew.

==Design and description==
''Imperator Alexandr III'' was {{convert|397|ft|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]], had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|76|ft|1|in|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of around {{convert|29|ft|2|in|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. Designed to displace {{convert|13516|LT|t|lk=in}}, she was over {{convert|600|LT|t}} overweight and displaced {{convert|14181|LT|t}}. This caused a problem during [[sea trial]]s on 6 October 1903 when ''Imperator Alexandr III'' made a high-speed turn that caused her to [[Heeling (sailing)|heel]] 15° and submerged the embrasures for the {{convert|75|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns. Her intended crew consisted of 28 officers and 754 enlisted men, although she carried 826–46 crewmen in service. Her design was based on that of the ''Tsesarevich'', modified to suit Russian machinery.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 136–38, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was powered by two 4-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], each driving one propeller shaft, using steam generated by 20 [[Belleville boiler]]s. The engines were rated at {{convert|15800|ihp|lk=in}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}}. ''Imperator Alexandr III'', however, only reached a top speed of {{convert|17.7|kn}} from {{convert|16225|ihp}} during her official machinery trials on 23 July 1903. She carried a maximum of {{convert|1350|LT|t}} of coal which allowed her to steam for {{convert|2590|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 137, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's [[main battery]] consisted of four {{convert|12|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns mounted in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] consisted of 12 [[Canet guns|Canet]] {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) gun]]s, mounted in twin-gun turrets. A number of smaller guns were carried for defence against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included twenty {{convert|75|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} QF guns and twenty {{convert|47|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s. She was also armed with four {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one each at the bow and stern above water and two submerged. ''Imperator Alexandr III''{{'}}s [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] consisted of [[Krupp armor]] and was {{convert|5.7|-|7.64|in|0}} thick. The armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and her [[deck (ship)|deck]] ranged from {{convert|1|to|2|in|0}} in thickness. The {{convert|1.5|in|adj=on}} armored lower deck curved downwards and formed an anti-[[torpedo bulkhead]].&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 136–37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==
Construction began on ''Imperator Alexandr III'', named after [[Tsar]] [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]],&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; on 5 September 1899 at the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Works]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The ship was [[Keel|laid down]] on 23 May 1900 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 3 August 1901.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; She was completed in November 1903&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; at the cost of 13,979,000 [[rubles]].&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 136, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 1904, ''Imperator Alexandr III'' set sail for Port Arthur from [[Liepaja|Libau]] along with the other vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron, under the overall command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]].&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Rozhestvensky led his squadron, including ''Imperator Alexandr III'', down the Atlantic coast of Africa, rounding [[Cape Horn]], and reached the island of [[Nosy Be]] off the north-west coast of Madagascar on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements. The squadron sailed for [[Camranh Bay]], [[French Indochina]], on 16 March and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral [[Nikolai Nebogatov]]. The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for [[Vladivostok]] on 14 May. While exact figures are not available for ''Imperator Alexandr III'', it is probable that the ship was approximately {{convert|1700|LT|t}} overweight as she and her [[sister ship|sisters]] were overloaded with coal and other supplies; all of which was stored high in the ships and reduced their [[Stability conditions|stability]]. The extra weight also submerged the waterline armor belt and left only about {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|1}} of the upper armor belt above the waterline.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 141, 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Rozhestvensky decided to take the most direct route to Vladivostok using the [[Tsushima Strait]] and was intercepted by the Japanese battlefleet under the command of Admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō]] on 27 May 1905. At the beginning of the battle, ''Imperator Alexandr III'' was second in line behind Rozhestvensky's [[flagship]], {{ship|Russian battleship|Knyaz Suvorov||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Very little is known of the ship's actions during the battle as there were no survivors from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle, but [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[William Christopher Pakenham|W. C. Pakenham]], the [[Royal Navy]]'s official military observer under the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]], noted that she was set on fire early in the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; She did initially follow ''Knyaz Suvorov'' when that ship's steering was damaged about a half-hour after the Japanese opened fire at 14:10, but turned north when her captain, Nikolai Bukhvostov, realized that ''Knyaz Suvorov'' was out of control. Tōgō tried to concentrate his fire on the crippled ''Knyaz Suvorov'' around 16:00, but Bukhvostov turned ''Imperator Alexandr III'' straight for the Japanese battleline in a successful attempt to focus their attention on his ship. He was successful,&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk, pp. 25, 63, 66&lt;/ref&gt; but she was badly damaged in the process. Observers noted that her bow was badly damaged and that there was a large hole in the forward hull on the port side.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; When the shooting resumed around 18:00, the Japanese concentrated their fire upon the ship and her sister, {{ship|Russian battleship|Borodino||2}}. ''Imperator Alexandr III'' sheered out of line to port around 18:30 and [[capsized]], but did not sink until 19:07; there were no survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, a granite [[obelisk]], designed by Artem Ober and Yakov Filote, was constructed in the surrounding gardens of [[St. Nicholas Naval Cathedral]], Saint Petersburg to remember the men of the ''Imperator Aleksandr III''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palytra.com/en/about_russia/information_saint-petersburg/cathedrals_churches_info_pictures/st.nicholas_cathedral/|title=Cathedrals and churches of Saint Petersburg - St.Nicholas Cathedral|publisher=Paltra Travel|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
