'''''Surcouf''''' was a {{sclass2|T 47|destroyer}} of the [[French Navy]]. She was the fourth French ship named in honour of [[Robert Surcouf]].

==Design and construction==
Laid down in February 1951 at [[Lorient]] and launched in October 1953, ''Surcouf'' was commissioned into the French Navy in 1955.&lt;ref name=netmarine&gt;{{cite web|first=Jean-Michel|last=Roche |url=http://www.netmarine.net/bat/ee/surcouf/index.htm|title=Escorteur d'Escadre Surcouf |language=French|trans_title=Fleet Escort ''Surcouf''|publisher=Netmarine.net|year=2010 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first of 12 T 47-class destroyers.&lt;ref name=harpoon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harpoondatabases.com/encyclopedia/Entry32.aspx |title=D 621 Surcouf DD |publisher=Harpoon Databases |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a standard displacement of 2,750 tons and a length of 128.6 metres, the ship had a beam of 12.7 metres and a draught of 5.4 metres. Her armament consisted of six 127-mm guns which were mounted in three twin turrets, six 57-mm guns in twin mounts and four single-mounted 20-mm guns. There were four banks of three 550-mm torpedo tubes, capable of launching both anti-submarine homing and anti-ship torpedoes. ''Surcouf'' had two shafts, geared turbines, and four boilers, which were capable of producing 63,000 horsepower and a top speed of 34 knots ({{convert|71,725|shp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}} and 38 knots during trials). At 18 knots, ''Surcouf'' had a range of 5,000 nautical miles. The ship had a complement of 347 personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways p110&quot;&gt;Gardiner and Chumbley 1995. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major modification=== 
In the early 1960s, ''Surcouf'' was converted to a command ship to become a Flotilla Leader.
In order to install an Operations centre and housings for an admiral and his staff, the forward 57mm mount was removed (extending forward the bridge) and the two aft torpedo platforms were removed so that housing quarters could be constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways p110&quot;/&gt;

The overhaul was conducted the arsenal of Brest between 11 June 1960 (commencement of work) and 4 October 1961 (end of the tests).

==Operational service==
Following her commissioning in November 1955, ''Surcouf''{{'s}} homeport was [[Toulon]], being assigned to the First destroyers flotilla (1st FEE), at the head of the Fourth destroyers Division (DEE4).

In 1956 she alternates naval exercises (including Nato's) and the Algerian coast surveillance. From October to December ''Surcouf'' took part in [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]] during the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Yahia2/Part4.htm |title=Operation Musketeer |publisher=Britain's Small Wars.com |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 1959 (on 10 April) her assignment and home Port are changed : ''Surcouf'' is attached to the Tenth destroyers Division (DEE10) into the light Fleet (the ''Escadre légère'') based in [[Brest, France|Brest]].

On 26 March 1960, ''Surcouf'' was accidentally rammed by the cargo ship ''Léognan'' off [[Groix]], with big material damage but without making victim.

After her transformation into Flotilla Leader (June 1960-October 1961) ''Surcouf'' is assigned to the main Fleet (the ''Escadre''), based in Toulon, where she sport the mark of the Admiral commanding the 1st FEE (ALFEE).

In March 1962, during the [[Battle of Bab El Oued]], ''Surcouf'' was set to shell the [[Organisation de l'armée secrète|OAS]]-held  [[Bab el-Oued]] quarter of [[Algiers]] along with her sister ship ''[[French destroyer Maillé-Brézé (D627)|Maillé-Brézé]]''. After suggestions from the naval command, the bombardment was called off as impractical. The destroyers kept in station close to the shore as a deterrent.&lt;ref name=netmarine/&gt; Along with other three destroyers, both vessels had ferried troops to Algiers on 2 March to counter the OAS rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Labour research, Volumen 51, p. 112. [[Labour Research Department]], 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final fate===
On 6 June 1971, before sunrise, in the Mediterranean {{convert|60|nmi|km}} south east of [[Cartagena, Spain]], as she sailed with the tactical group of the [[Arromanches (R 95)|''Arromanches'']], ''Surcouf'' was again rammed accidentally when she cut across the bow of the Soviet [[Petroleum tanker|tanker]] ''General Busharov''. The tanker, six times heavier than the destroyer, could not avoid the collision and rammed ''Surcouf'' at 16 knots. Nine men from ''Surcouf'' were lost at sea and one was severely burned (he later died of his wounds). When the French destroyer ''[[French destroyer Tartu (D636)|Tartu]]'' (which belonged to the same tactical group) attempted to tow the badly damaged ship, ''Surcouf'' snapped in two, the bow sinking quickly. The aft part was taken in tow to Toulon via Cartagena.

She was eventually sunk as a target by an [[Exocet]] anti-ship missile after being decommissioned on 5 May 1972.&lt;ref name=netmarine/&gt;
