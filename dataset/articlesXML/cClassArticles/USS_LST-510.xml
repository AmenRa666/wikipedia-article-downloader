'''USS ''Buncombe County'' (LST-510)''' was an {{Sclass|LST-491|tank landing ship}} built for the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Named for [[Buncombe County, North Carolina]], she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. She currently serves as a [[ferry]] between [[New London, Connecticut]], and [[Orient, New York|Orient, Long Island]].

== Construction ==
''LST-510'' was laid down on 27 September 1943 at [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]] by the [[Jeffboat|Jeffersonville Boat and Machine Company]]; launched on 30 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. C. P. Watson; and placed in reduced commission on 18 January 1944. Departing her builders' yard three days later, on 21 January, ''LST-510'' proceeded down the [[Mississippi River]] to [[New Orleans]], where she was placed in full commission on 31 January 1944 with Lieutenant George P. Andrews in command.

==Service history==

===Convoy to England, March&amp;ndash;April 1944===
After fitting out, ''LST-510'' carried out an abbreviated shakedown cruise to the vicinity of [[Panama City, Florida]], returning to New Orleans in February for post-shakedown availability. On 1 March ''LST-510'' loaded the 150-ton [[tank landing craft]] {{USS|LCT-709||2}} onto her upper deck. She then headed to [[New York City]], where she embarked additional crewmen and took on board 600 tons of ammunition. From there, she proceeded via [[Boston]] to [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and then left [[North America]]n waters on 29 March in a 64-ship convoy. Like most passages of the North Atlantic during World War II, this one proved hazardous and chilling, both in the physical and the psychological sense. In one three-day period, she endured fog, sleet, and a wind that drove {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}} waves over her bow. Then, there was the occasional iceberg. Yet, undoubtedly, [[U-boat]]s caused the greatest anxiety. They [[torpedo]]ed four ships in the convoy, one of them just {{convert|400|yd|m}} away on ''LST-510''{{'}}s port quarter. On one occasion, maneuvers to evade the unseen enemy briefly threw the convoy into disorder in dense fog. To make matters worse, ''LST-510''{{'}}s engines broke down. All on board shared the certain fear that a torpedo would soon set off her explosive cargo until successful repairs allowed her to resume her harried voyage. ''LST-510'' reached [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]] safely on 13 April.

===Invasion of Normandy, June 1944===
From there, ''LST-510'' crossed the [[Irish Sea]] and stopped briefly at [[Milford Haven]], [[Wales]] before proceeding on to [[Plymouth, England]] where she delivered ''LCT-709''. During May, 1944 ''LST-510'' outfitted at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and [[Fowey]] for her next mission while &quot;[[scuttlebutt]]&quot; over the nature of that assignment flew furiously. Orders to load vehicles only heightened the excitement and accelerated the pace of work. Then, on 1 June 1944, ''LST-510'' embarked 200 men and 70 vehicles of the [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Infantry Division]], and the ship backed out into the bay and anchored. From that moment on, no one was allowed off the ship. At 0337 on 4 June, ''LST-510'' weighed anchor and got underway, bound for the coast of France, but put about to return to Plymouth when foul weather compelled postponement. Finally, at 0355 on 5 June, ''LST-510'' again shaped a course for France. By daybreak, ''LST-510'' had formed up with Convoy B 1 of the 4,000-vessel Western Task Force. Neither ''LST-510'' nor her embarked soldiers took part in the initial [[Invasion of Normandy|assault at Normandy]]. The invasion was already eight hours old when she began approaching [[Omaha Beach]], near [[Vierville-sur-Mer|Vierville]]. She could not get all the way in to the beach itself, so ''LST-510'' unloaded her cargo and disembarked her men via LCTs and &quot;Rhino&quot; [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]] [[barge]]s. That night, ''LST-510'' endured her first air raid, but her only loss proved to be sleep. The raids continued sporadically throughout the night. Even before all of ''LST-510''{{'}}s cargo had been unloaded, she began embarking wounded men for treatment. The three doctors on board performed their work in a &quot;magnificent&quot; manner, &quot;in the face of existing conditions,&quot; laboring throughout the night on the ship's tank deck where an operating room had been set up.

===Channel operations, June 1944&amp;ndash;June 1945===
In the next three months, ''LST-510'' shuttled between the [[Isle of Portland]] and [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], England, and [[Utah Beach|Utah]] or Omaha Beach, transporting troops and vehicles eastward and casualties westward across the [[English Channel]]. In late September, on her 21st passage across the channel, ''LST-510'' beached over a hollow on the bottom which produced abnormal stresses on her hull, throwing her starboard shaft out of alignment. Forced to return to England on one engine, the tank landing ship was [[drydock]]ed for repairs at Plymouth for a month. ''LST-510'' spent the first half of November, 1944 at anchor off [[Le Havre]] with a low-priority cargo waiting word to move inshore. Following two voyages to [[Rouen]], the ship was proceeding to [[Cherbourg]] when she hit an underwater obstruction which holed her hull, flooding both engine rooms and plunging the ship into darkness. The next day, in tow of another LST, the ship headed back to Portland for temporary repairs, and to Falmouth for another month of drydocking and engine repairs. Even after that, bad luck continued to dog ''LST-510''. On 5 February 1945 while returning from Le Havre in a dense fog, she collided bow-to-bow with SS ''Chapel Hill Victory'' south of the [[Isle of Wight]], demolishing her own bow as far aft as frame 10. The pea-soup fog had nullified the efforts of her bow lookouts who had but a few seconds warning as the &quot;[[Victory ship]]&quot; loomed out of the murk. One of ''LST-510''{{'}}s bow lookouts died in the mishap. Drydocked at Falmouth until mid-May, ''LST-510'' finally left Plymouth for the United States on 7 June 1945.

===Return to the US, June 1945===
After touching at [[Norfolk]], the tank landing ship proceeded via New Orleans to [[Galveston, Texas]] where she prepared for [[Pacific]] service. However, [[Japanese surrender|Japan's capitulation]] in August 1945 cancelled plans for her journey to the Pacific. Instead, ''LST-510'' reported to [[Green Cove Springs, Florida]] where she was placed out of commission on 1 July 1946.

''LST-510'' received one [[battle star]] for her World War II service.

===Decommissioning and sale===
Inactive for over a decade, she was named '''USS ''Buncombe County'' (LST-510)''' on 1 July 1955. Deemed &quot;unfit for further Naval service&quot; on 27 October 1958, her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 1 November 1958. 
[[Image:USS-LST-510-SERVICE.jpg|thumb|USS ''LST-510'']]
In 1960 or 1961, the ship was sold to the [[Chesapeake Bay Ferry District]] of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and renamed '''MV ''Virginia Beach'''''. Resold in 1964 or 1965 to the [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]], she was renamed '''MV ''Cape Henelopen''''' and converted to a passenger and auto [[ferry]] in 1966, operating between [[Lewes, Delaware]] and [[Cape May, New Jersey]]. Purchased in 1983 by Cross Sound Ferry Services, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.longislandferry.com/capeh.html USS ''LST-510'' renamed ''Cape Henlopen'']&lt;/ref&gt; of [[New London, Connecticut]], she underwent a total refurbishment before entering service between [[Orient Point, New York]] ([[Long Island]]) and New London, perhaps making it the only [[D-Day]] veteran ship to still be in active service ([https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Orient+Point,+NY&amp;daddr=New+London,+CT&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=41.254715,-72.16942&amp;sspn=0.309727,0.416107&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11 map]). The ferry was repowered during the winter of 1995 with [[EMD 645|EMD 12-645]] diesel engines.
