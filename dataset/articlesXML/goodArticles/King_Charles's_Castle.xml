'''King Charles's Castle''' is a ruined artillery fort overlooking [[New Grimsby harbour]] on the island of [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] in the [[Isles of Scilly]]. Built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the islands from French attack, it would have held a [[Artillery battery|battery of guns]] and an accompanying garrison, designed to prevent enemy vessels from entering the harbour. The castle is polygonal in design, constructed from [[granite]] stone, with the gun battery at the front, and a dining room, kitchen and living accommodation at the rear. An additional defensive earthwork was constructed around it during the 17th century. The design of the castle is unusual for the period, and is only seen elsewhere in [[blockhouse]]s along the [[River Thames]].

The castle's design was unsatisfactory, as its guns could not be angled so to fire down into the harbour, and its defences were considered vulnerable to attack. To mitigate this, an additional blockhouse was probably constructed below, closer to the water, but eventually a new fortification, the [[Star Castle, Isles of Scilly|Star Castle]], was built instead on the neighbouring island of [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which became the main fort in the Scilly Isles. In the aftermath of the [[English Civil War]], the Scilly Isles were held by the Royalist sympathisers of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who gave the castle its current name. The islands were then attacked by a Parliamentary force led by Sir [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] in 1651, who landed on Tresco but bypassed the fort as he took the island. Its Royalist defenders blew up parts of the castle as they left, and some of its stone appears to have been used to build the newer [[Cromwell's Castle]] by the harbour.

Although King Charles's Castle was being used to house soldiers in 1660, by the 18th century it was described as ruinous. After 1922, the castle passed into the guardianship of the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]], and [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]] were carried out in 1954. In the 21st century the site is controlled by [[English Heritage]] and is open to visitors. It is protected under UK law as a [[scheduled monument]] and a Grade II* [[listed building]].

==History==

===16th century===

====Construction====
King Charles's Castle was built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the [[Scilly Isles]] against French attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions with France had grown during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and spilled over into war in 1538.&lt;ref name=ONeil1951P18&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1961|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry initially responded by fortifying the coasts of England, constructing new artillery forts designed to defend against the longer-range cannons that were becoming common in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=ONeil1951P18/&gt; Henry's son, the nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], inherited the throne in 1547, facing renewed war with France.&lt;ref name=ONeil1951P18/&gt; [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]] was made the [[Lord Protector]] to the King, and he appointed his brother, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas]], as England's [[Lord Admiral]].&lt;ref name=Brodie2010P27&gt;{{harvnb|Brodie|2010|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas inspected the Scilly Isles personally and concluded that they were vulnerable to a French invasion.&lt;ref name=Brodie2010P27/&gt;

[[File:Interior of King Charles' Castle - geograph.org.uk - 834051.jpg|thumb|The interior of the hall]]
As a result of the inspection, Sir [[Francis Fleming (MP)|Francis Flemming]], the [[Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance]], was tasked in February 1558 with improving the defences on the islands.&lt;ref name=Brodie2010P27/&gt; Flemming was supported in this effort with a shipment of lead to aid in construction, and money raised from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]] in England.&lt;ref name=Brodie2010P27/&gt; The building work initially focused on the island of [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of [[Pendennis Castle]] in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]].&lt;ref name=Brodie2010PP2627&gt;{{harvnb|Brodie|2010|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tresco was in need of modern defences, but Killigrew also wanted to use the work programme to increase his political influence on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brodie|2010|pp=26–28}}; {{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011a|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The castle was built as part of this programme of work.&lt;ref name=Brodie2010PP2627/&gt; It was positioned on the high ground of Castle Down to protect [[New Grimsby harbour]], overlooking the narrow, northern entrance to the harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|p=6}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/king-charless-castle/history-and-research/ | title=HISTORY AND RESEARCH: KING CHARLES'S CASTLE | mode = cs2|accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=303391&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=new%20ditch&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10&amp;p=28&amp;move=n&amp;nor=388&amp;recfc=0| title=KING CHARLES CASTLE | mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have held a battery of guns and an accompanying garrison, designed to prevent enemy vessels from entering the harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Seymour fell from power in 1549, and after his removal a new survey was carried out by Captain William Tyrell, in part to confirm that the new fortifications were suitably located across the islands.&lt;ref name=Brodie2010P27/&gt; Building work across the Scilly Isles continued, expanding to include the neighbouring island of [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]].&lt;ref name=Brodie2010P28/&gt; At least 540 [[oak]] trees from [[South Wales]] were dispatched to the islands in early 1550, as the islands lacked suitable sources of timber of their own.&lt;ref name=Brodie2010P28&gt;{{harvnb|Brodie|2010|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orders were given in 1551 to send [[Bow and arrow|bows, arrows]] and the ingredients required to make [[gunpowder]] to the islands, where construction teams were kept at work throughout 1552.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brodie|2010|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Blockhouse appears to have been completed, but the Crown's resources had become badly stretched and it was decided at the end of 1552 to curtail further expenditure on the Scilly Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brodie|2010|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1548 and 1552, a total of £3,123 had been spent on improving the fortifications on the islands; a 1579 survey suggested that, with the cost of the garrisons, the project had come to a total of £6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brodie|2010|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|It is difficult to accurately compare 16th-century and modern prices or incomes. £3,123 could equate to between £809,000 and £9,700,000 in 2012 terms, depending on the measure used. For comparison, the smaller defences along the south coast of England each cost Henry VIII between £500 to £1,000 to build, and the larger forts as much as £10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.measuringworth.com/index.php| title=Measuring Worth Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present| mode = cs2|accessdate=28 December 2013 |publisher=Measuring Worth}}; {{harvnb|Brodie|2011|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Edward's successor, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], intended to establish a garrison of 150 soldiers on the islands, but it is uncertain if these numbers were ever achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brodie|2010|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1558, Killigrew held the title of the &quot;captain in the Castell of Tresco&quot;, referring to King Charles's Castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;list.english-heritage.org.uk resultsingle&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weaknesses====
It soon became evident that King Charles's Castle had been built in a poor location.&lt;ref name=HistoryandResearchListEntry&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/king-charless-castle/history-and-research/ | title=HISTORY AND RESEARCH: KING CHARLES'S CASTLE|mode = cs2| accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was {{convert|40|m}} above sea level and its guns could only fire at enemy ships in the harbour by being angled downwards.&lt;ref name=HistoryandResearchListEntry/&gt; Artillery pieces in the 16th century could not fire in this position as the cannonballs would fall out of their muzzles, making the castle much less effective in defending Tresco.&lt;ref name=HistoryandResearchListEntry/&gt; By 1554, a small blockhouse had been built beneath the castle on the future site of [[Cromwell's Castle]], overlooking the harbour just above the sea level to compensate for this weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1961|pp=19–20}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concerns over the castle were significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1961|p=20}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/king-charless-castle/history-and-research/ | title=HISTORY AND RESEARCH: KING CHARLES'S CASTLE| mode = cs2|accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Godolphin, who at the time was renting Tresco from the Crown, commented at the end of the century that the castle could not defend the island as &quot;it neither discovereth the whole harbour so through the iminent height thereof can make no good shot so steep downwards&quot;, and also complained about its fortification, &quot;which is worst, is of so weak form as it cannot be defended&quot;.&lt;ref name=ONeil1961P20&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1961|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially in response to these problems, the new [[Star Castle, Isles of Scilly|Star Castle]] was constructed on St Mary's island between 1593 and 1594; a more modern, well-positioned design, Star Castle rapidly became the key defensive site in the Scilly Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|pp=14–17}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/king-charless-castle/history-and-research/ | title=HISTORY AND RESEARCH: KING CHARLES'S CASTLE| mode = cs2|accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
[[File:Cromwell Castle and King Charles's Castle.jpg|thumb|The castle (top), overlooking [[New Grimsby harbour]] and [[Cromwell's Castle]] (bottom)]]

The Scilly Isles supported [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] during the [[English Civil War]], and after a short period in Parliamentary control rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011a|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Brodie|2011|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] on Tresco appeared to have believed that King Charles's Castle was a critical defensive point on the island and probably built new earthwork defences around the castle to defend it against an attack from the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, however, that these defences instead date from around 1627, and were built by the King's engineer, Bernard Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=303391&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=new%20ditch&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10&amp;p=28&amp;move=n&amp;nor=388&amp;recfc=0| title=KING CHARLES CASTLE| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}; {{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|pp=10, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the castle was given its current name.&lt;ref name=HistoryandResearch&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/king-charless-castle/history-and-research/ | title=HISTORY AND RESEARCH: KING CHARLES'S CASTLE| mode = cs2|accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tresco formed a base for Royalist [[privateer]]s, and Parliament became concerned that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might counter the piracy by occupying the islands, gaining a foothold they could then use against England.&lt;ref name=EH&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/cromwells-castle/history-and-research/ | title=History and Research: Cromwell's Castle| accessdate=4 January 2013 | publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1651 Parliament sent Sir [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] in charge of a naval task force to retake the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011a|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake arrived at St Helen's Pool in April 1651, and set about invading the island of Tresco.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1961|p=22}}; {{cite web | url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/old-blockhouse/audio/ | title=Audio Tour of Old Blockhouse| mode = cs2|accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the harbour of Old Grimsby in an amphibious assault on 18 April, he then simply bypassed King Charles' Castle and marched south, using Tresco as a basis for then taking the neighbouring island of St Mary's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1961|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Bowden|2011|p=65}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royalist commander of the castle, William Edgecumbe, retreated from the castle on 19 April and the defenders blew up part of the site as they left, leaving the remains to the Parliamentary commander Colonel George Fleetwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Bowden|2011|pp=65, 67}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=303391&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=new%20ditch&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10&amp;p=28&amp;move=n&amp;nor=388&amp;recfc=0| title=KING CHARLES CASTLE|mode=cs2| accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/king-charless-castle/audio/ | title=Audio Tour of King Charles's Castle| mode = cs2|accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco|mode=cs2| accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the castle's stonework appears to have been reused in the construction of the new Cromwell's Castle by the Parliamentarians, just beneath King Charles's Castle, the new fortification being sited in a much better position to defend the harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1961|p=24}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=303391&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=new%20ditch&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10&amp;p=28&amp;move=n&amp;nor=388&amp;recfc=0| title=KING CHARLES CASTLE| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1660, Charles II was restored to the throne and Edward Sherburne was sent to the Scilly Isles to inspect the defences.&lt;ref name=BowdenBrodie2011bP30&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended that repairs be carried out to King Charles's Castle, which was then being used to house soldiers.&lt;ref name=BowdenBrodie2011bP30/&gt;

The Crown, in the form of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], leased the islands in 1687 to the Godolphin family, followed by Augustus Smith in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ghgraham.org/text/arthurdorriensmith1876_obit.html | title=Obituary - Major Dorrien-Smith| postscript =| mode = cs2|accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[antiquary]] [[William Borlase]] was critical of the castle—by then in ruins—during his 1752 visit, describing it as a &quot;work of labour and expense, rather than of skill&quot;, and attributing its abandonment to its poor military utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borlase|1756|pp=46–47}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|1986|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer John Troutbeck, commenting at the end of the century, took a similar perspective, praising the thickness of the walls, but noting that it was ill-positioned to fire into the harbour, unlike its replacement below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Troutbeck|1796|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the lease passed to [[Arthur Algernon Dorrien-Smith|Arthur Dorrien-Smith]], who agreed to pass several properties on Tresco, including the castle, into the guardianship of the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1961|p=3}}; {{cite web | url=http://ghgraham.org/text/arthurdorriensmith1876_obit.html | title=Obituary - Major Dorrien-Smith| postscript =| mode = cs2|accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was partially [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] in 1954, uncovering coins, pottery and a buckle.&lt;ref name=HeritageGateway&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MCO30717&amp;resourceID=1020| title=KING CHARLES CASTLE - Post Medieval castle| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=Heritage Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the first floor of the battery were reconstructed from the fallen stonework uncovered during the dig.&lt;ref name=&quot;list.english-heritage.org.uk resultsingle&quot;/&gt;

Behind the battery is a large room, {{convert|8.8|m}} by {{convert|6|m}}, forming a hall and kitchen, originally for the use of the garrison and containing a fireplace and oven.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|pp=8–9}}; {{harvnb|O'Neil|1961|p=19}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The room has two bedrooms leading off it, each {{convert|2.9|m}} square.&lt;ref name=BowdenBrodie2011bPP8ListEntry/&gt; The north bedroom may have been heated by a small [[brazier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A guardroom, {{convert|3.5|m}} square, forms the entrance to the building, leading into the hall.&lt;ref name=BowdenBrodie2011bPP8ListEntry/&gt;

The castle is made from [[ashlar|dressed]] and rubble [[granite]], incorporating an underling rocky outcrop into the design in the north-west and south-west corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|pp=8–9}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MCO30717&amp;resourceID=1020| title=KING CHARLES CASTLE - Post Medieval castle| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=Heritage Gateway}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In places the walls survive up to {{convert|3.4|m}} high and {{convert|1.65|m}} thick, but are on average only {{convert|1.5|m}} tall and {{convert|0.8|m}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=303391&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=new%20ditch&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10&amp;p=28&amp;move=n&amp;nor=388&amp;recfc=0| title=KING CHARLES CASTLE|mode=cs2| accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions vary as to how tall the castle was when first built; it may have been two storeys high throughout, or may only have been that height in the gun battery, with the living accommodation being a single storey construction.&lt;ref name=BowdenBrodie2011BHistoryandResearch&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|pp=8–9}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/king-charless-castle/history-and-research/ | title=HISTORY AND RESEARCH: KING CHARLES'S CASTLE| mode = cs2|accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|English Heritage argues that the whole site was two storeys tall; the Cornwall and Scilly Historical Environmental Record favours a mixture of two and single storey construction; the historians Mark Bowden and Allan Brodie suggest that it is impossible to tell.&lt;ref name=BowdenBrodie2011BHistoryandResearch/&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The upper storey of the gun battery would have held additional guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/king-charless-castle/audio/ | title=Audio Tour of King Charles's Castle| mode = cs2|accessdate=29 January 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecturally, the castle is unusual for this period.&lt;ref name=ONeil1961P20/&gt; Its design appears somewhat backward, particularly in comparison to the nearby fortification of [[Harry's Walls]], built at the same time as the castle, but which adopted a more contemporary design that employed [[bastions]].&lt;ref name=HistoryandResearch/&gt; Its closest equivalents are the blockhouses built by Henry VIII on the River Thames.&lt;ref name=ONeil1961P20/&gt;

===Earthworks===
The castle is surrounded by a rectangular earthwork, probably built in 1627, and similar to that at [[Sandsfoot Castle|Sandsfoot]] and [[Pendennis Castle]]s.&lt;ref name=BowdenBrodie2011BP10Pastscape&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|Brodie|2011b|p=10}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=303391&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=new%20ditch&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10&amp;p=28&amp;move=n&amp;nor=388&amp;recfc=0| title=KING CHARLES CASTLE| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretches away north-east from the castle, with an earth and rubble bank up to {{convert|2|m}} high and {{convert|8|m}} wide, with a bastion and demi-bastion at its corners and a ditch, up to {{convert|0.4|m}} deep and {{convert|3|m}} wide along the north and east sides.&lt;ref name=BowdenBrodie2011BP10Pastscape/&gt;

Another line of earthworks survives around {{convert|40|m}} south-east of these earthworks; its bank is {{convert|0.3|m}} high, with a ditch up to {{convert|0.2|m}} deep.&lt;ref name=Bowden2011P8&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|2011|p=8}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1016181| title=Oliver's Battery, Tresco| mode = cs2|accessdate=27 April 2014 |publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies just behind the crest of the hill, possibly for concealment, and is defended with bastions and orillons although it appears not to have been finished.&lt;ref name=Bowden2011P8/&gt; It probably dates from the mid-16th century, possibly having been built at around the same time as the castle.&lt;ref name=Bowden2011P8/&gt;
