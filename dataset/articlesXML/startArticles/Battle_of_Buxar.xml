The '''Battle of Buxar''' was fought on  22 October 1764 between the forces under the command of the British [[East India Company]] led by [[Hector Munro, 8th of Novar|Hector Munro]] and the combined army of [[Mir Qasim]], the [[Nawab of Bengal]]; the [[Nawab of Awadh]]; and the [[Mughal Emperor|Mughal King]] [[Shah Alam II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Modern History (1707–1947) |author=Parshotam Mehra |isbn=0-19-561552-2 |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle fought at [[Buxar]], a &quot;small fortified town&quot; within the territory of [[Bengal]], located on the bank of the [[Ganges|Ganges river]] about 130&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Patna]], was a decisive victory for the British [[East India Company]].

==Battle==
British troops engaged in the fighting numbered 7,072&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=DoZCAAAAYAAJ |page=113 |title=Sir Edward Cust, Annals of the Wars of the Eighteenth Century, Vol. 3 }}, Mitchell's Military Library (1858). ISBN 1235663922&lt;/ref&gt; comprising 857 British, 5,297 Indian [[sepoy]]s and 918 Indian cavalry. The alliance army's numbers were estimated to be over 40,000. According to other sources, the combined army of the Mughals, Awadh and [[Mir Qasim]] consisting of 40,000 men was defeated by a British army comprising 10,000 men.

The Mughal camp was internally broken due to a quarrel between the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Alam II]] and [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] the [[Nawab of Awadh]]; [[Mir Qasim]] was reluctant to engage the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], and instead went off to collect tribute. The lack of basic co-ordination among the three desperate allies was responsible for their decisive defeat.

[[Mirza Najaf Khan]] commanded the right flank of the imperial army and was the first to advance his forces against Major [[Hector Munro, 8th of Novar|Hector Munro]] at daybreak; the British lines formed within twenty minutes and reversed the advance of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s. According to the British, [[Durrani]] and [[Rohilla]] cavalry were also present and fought during the battle in various skirmishes. But by midday the battle was over and [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] blew up large tumbrils and three massive magazines of gunpowder.

Munro divided his army into various columns and particularly pursued the Mughal [[Grand Vizier]] [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] the [[Nawab of Awadh]], who responded by blowing up his boat-bridge after crossing the river, thus abandoning the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Alam II]] and members of his own regiment. [[Mir Qasim]] also fled with his 3 million rupees worth of [[Gemstone]]s and later even committed suicide. [[Mirza Najaf Khan]] reorganised formations around [[Shah Alam II]], who retreated and then chose to negotiate with the victorious British.

Historian [[John William Fortescue]] claimed that the British casualties totalled 847: 39 killed and 64 wounded from the European regiments and 250 killed, 435 wounded and 85 missing from the East India Company's sepoys.&lt;ref name=Fortescue102 /&gt; He also claimed that the three Indian allies suffered 2,000 dead and that many more were wounded.&lt;ref name=Fortescue102 /&gt; Another source says that there were 69 European and 664 sepoy casualties on the British side and 6,000 casualties on the Mughal side.&lt;ref name=Cambridge160/&gt; The victors captured 133 pieces of artillery and over 1 million rupees of cash. Immediately after the battle Munro decided to assist the [[Maratha]]s, who were described as a &quot;warlike race&quot;, well known for their relentless and unwavering hatred towards the [[Mughal Empire]] and its [[Nawab]]s and the [[Sultanate of Mysore]].

==Aftermath==
The British victory at Buxar had &quot;at one fell swoop, disposed of the three main scions of Moghul power in Upper India. Mir Kasim [Qasim]  disappeared into an impoverished obscurity. Shah Alam realigned himself with the British, and Shah Shuja [Shuja-ud-Daula] fled west hotly pursued by the victors. The whole Ganges valley lay at the Company's mercy; Shah Shuja eventually surrendered; henceforth Company troops became the power-brokers throughout Oudh as well as Bihar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, John.
