'''''Concorde''''' was a 32-gun [[frigate]] of the [[French Navy]], lead ship of [[Concorde class frigate|her class]]. Built in Rochefort in 1777, she entered service with the French early in the [[American War of Independence]], and was soon in action, capturing {{HMS|Minerva|1759|6}} in the [[West Indies]]. She survived almost until the end of the war, but was captured by {{HMS|Magnificent|1767|6}} in 1783. Not immediately brought into service due to the draw-down in the navy after the end of the war, she underwent repairs and returned to active service under the [[White Ensign]] with the outbreak of war with France in 1793 as the [[fifth-rate]] '''HMS ''Concorde'''''.

Initially part of squadrons cruising off the French coast, she played an important part in the [[Action of 23 April 1794]], capturing the French frigate [[French frigate Engageante (1766)|''Engageante'']], and at a later engagement, where she helped to capture the French frigate [[French frigate Virginie (1794)|''Virginie'']]. From 1797 until the early 19th century she had especial success against privateers, capturing a large number in the West Indies and in the Atlantic. She had a narrow escape from a superior French force in 1801, but was able to batter her pursuer, the 40-gun [[French frigate Bravoure (1795)|''Bravoure'']] into submission. She was prevented from capturing her by the arrival of French reinforcements. Her last years were spent on a variety of stations, including at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and the [[East Indies]]. Laid up in 1807, she was sold for breaking up in 1811.

==Construction and French career==
''Concorde'' was one of a three-ship class of [[Concorde class frigate|''Concorde''-class]] frigates built for the French Navy to a design by Henri Chevillard.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714–1792|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was built at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] between April 1777 and January 1778, being launched on 3 September 1777.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; She went out to the [[West Indies]] after the French entry to the [[American War of Independence]], and reached [[Martinique]] on 17 August 1778.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marley&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marley |title=Wars of the Americas|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 August 1778 she came up on the 32-gun {{HMS|Minerva|1759|6}}, under Captain John Stott, and after two and a half hours of fighting, captured her.{{Ref label|B|b|none}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Marley&quot;/&gt; ''Minerva'' was towed to [[Cap Français]] on [[Saint-Domingue]], where she was joined shortly afterwards by the captured {{HMS|Active|1758|6}}, which a hurricane had dismasted in late August and which the French frigates [[French frigate Charmante (1777)|''Charmante'']] and [[French frigate Dédaigneuse (1766)|''Dédaigneuse'']] had captured on 1 September.{{Ref label|C|c|none}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Coleman |title=The Nelson Touch|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714–1792|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1781 ''Concorde'' was responsible for vital transfers of personnel, funds, and communications that contributed to the [[Franco-American alliance|allied]] success at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]].  In March 1781 she carried despatches to [[George Washington]] and the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] from France.  These despatches included a request from the [[François Joseph Paul de Grasse|comte de Grasse]], commander of the West Indies fleet, for information on planned allied operations and the delivery of pilots familiar with the American coast.  She also carried 6 million [[French livre|livres]] to support the war effort, and the new commander of the French naval squadron at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], the [[Jacques-Melchior Saint-Laurent, Comte de Barras|comte de Barras]].&lt;ref&gt;Dull, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Following a conference of allied leaders in May, ''Concorde'' was sent to Cap-Français with despatches for de Grasse and the requested pilots.&lt;ref&gt;Dull, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; When de Grasse received these despatches, he made the critical decision to sail his fleet to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to assist in land operations against British forces operating under the command of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] in [[Virginia]]. ''Concorde'' carried de Grasse's letters for Washington, Rochambeau, and de Barras back to Newport; arrival of this news set in motion Washington's march to Virginia and the eventual entrapment of Cornwallis at Yorktown.&lt;ref&gt;Dull, pp. 243–245&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 1783, ''Concorde'' was in company with ''Nymphe''. They sighted [[HMS Ceres (1777)|HMS ''Raven'']], which initially sailed towards them until she realized that they were not British frigates. An all-day chase ensued until about 9p.m. when one of the frigates got within pistol-shot and fired a broadside that took away ''Raven{{'}}''s main topgallant-mast. The chase continued until about 10:30p.m. when one of the frigates was again in range, with the other coming up rapidly. At this point, ''Raven'', which was under the command of Commander John Wells, [[striking the colours|struck]]. The French Navy took ''Raven'' into service under the name ''Cérès'', which she had born when under French colours between 1778 and 1782.

===Capture===
[[File:Concorde and HMS Minerva.jpg|thumb|The battle between ''Concorde'' and {{HMS|Minerva|1759|6}}]]
On 15 February the 74-gun {{HMS|Magnificent|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Robert Linzee]], sighted ''Concorde''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |title=Memoir of the Life and Services of Admiral Sir William Hargood|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Magnificent'' had sailed from [[Gros Islet|Gros Islet Bay]] on 12 February on a cruise in company with the 64-gun ships {{HMS|Prudent|1768|6}} and {{HMS|St Albans|1764|6}}, and on sighting the strange sail, ''Magnificent'' gave chase. She was close enough to identify the mysterious ship as a frigate by 18:00, and by 20:00 as darkness fell ''Concorde'' opened fire on her pursuer with her stern guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;/&gt; ''Magnificent'' [[Action of 15 February 1783|overhauled the French]] ship by 21:15, and after fifteen minutes forced her to [[striking the colours|strike her colours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;/&gt; ''Magnificent'' took possession of ''Concorde'', the latter being described as carrying 36 guns and 300 men, and being under the command of M. le Chevalier du Clesmaur. Shortly after surrendering the ''Concorde''{{'}}s maintopsail caught fire, forcing the crew to cut away the mainmast to extinguish it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;/&gt; ''Prudent'' and ''St Albans'' came up two hours later and ''Magnificent'' towed ''Concorde'' to [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John's]], [[Antigua]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;/&gt;

==Interwar years==
''Concorde'' was bought into the navy and commissioned in the West Indies for a return to Britain later in the year, though her commander for this voyage is unknown. She arrived in Britain and was paid off in September at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; With the end of the American War of Independence and the draw-down in the navy, ''Concorde'' was not brought into immediate service but remained laid up at Chatham until November 1790, when a great repair was begun by Wilson, of [[Frindsbury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; The work, which cost a total of £18,259, was completed by April 1793, by which time the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] had broken out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; She was fitted for service at Chatham between April and May 1793, at a cost of £6,600, and was commissioned in April under Captain Thomas Wells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;

==French Revolutionary Wars==
In 1794 command of ''Concorde'' passed to Captain [[Sir Richard Strachan, 6th Baronet|Sir Richard Strachan]], and she joined [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Sir John Borlase Warren, 1st Baronet|John Borlase Warren's]] squadron off the French coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; The squadron also included Warren's 36-gun {{HMS|Flora|1780|6}}, the 38-gun {{HMS|Arethusa|1781|6}} under Captain [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Sir Edward Pellew]], and the 36-gun frigates {{HMS|Melampus|1785|6}}, under Captain Thomas Wells, and {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}, under Captain [[George Murray (Royal Navy officer)|George Murray]].&lt;ref name=&quot;James199&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James |title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Concorde'' and ''Engageante''===
{{main|Action of 23 April 1794}}
[[File:Capture of Engageante Babet and Pomone 131144.JPG|thumb|right|Depiction of the [[Action of 23 April 1794]] by [[Thomas Whitcombe]]]]
While sailing off the [[Channel Islands]] on 23 April the British squadron came across a French squadron under Commodore Desgareaux consisting of the 36-gun [[French frigate Engageante (1766)|''Engageante'']], the 44-gun [[French frigate Pomone (1787)|''Pomone'']], the 36-gun [[French frigate Résolue (1778)|''Résolue'']] and the 24-gun [[HMS Babet (1794)|''Babet'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;James200&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James |title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren chased and [[Action of 23 April 1794|engaged them]], leading the attack in ''Flora''. When the ''Flora'' was badly damaged from the combined fire from the French ships, the remaining British ships came up in support, and forced the rear-most French ships, ''Babet'' and ''Pomone'', to surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;James201&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James |title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Melampus'', ''Nymphe'' and ''Concorde'' gave chase to the fleeing ''Résolue'' and ''Engageante''. Strachan in ''Concorde'' attempted to damage the rearmost of the French ships, ''Engageante'', before pushing on to chase ''Résolue'', but the ''Résolue'' dropped back to support the ''Engageante'', damaging ''Concorde''{{'}}s sails and rigging. With ''Nymphe'' and ''Melampus'' still too far astern, and unable to catch ''Résolue'' himself, Strachan engaged ''Engageante'' and after 105 minutes of fighting, forced her to surrender, while ''Résolue'' made her escape.{{Ref label|D|d|none}}&lt;ref name=&quot;James201&quot;/&gt; The ''Concorde'' lost one man killed and 12 wounded in the fighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;James202&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=James|title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Concorde'' and ''Virginie''===
''Concorde'' was then assigned to Rear-Admiral [[George Montagu (Royal Navy officer)|George Montagu's]] squadron in May 1794, and took part in the manoeuvres during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; Strachan left ''Concorde'' in July 1794 to take command of HMS ''Melampus'', and in August Captain Anthony Hunt took over command of ''Concorde''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; ''Concorde'' was part of John Warren's squadron off [[Quiberon]] between June and July 1795, supporting the [[Invasion of France (1795)|Quiberon Expedition]], after which she joined Sir Edward Pellew's squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; On 20 April 1796 Pellew's squadron, then consisting of ''Concorde'', Pellew's 38-gun {{HMS|Indefatigable|1784|6}} and the 36-gun {{HMS|Amazon|1795|6}} under Captain [[Robert Carthew Reynolds]], spotted and chased a mysterious sail.&lt;ref name=&quot;James324&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James |title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; After chasing her for 15 hours over 168 miles they caught up with her, with ''Indefatigable'' leading the attack. Both ships exchanged fire, considerably damaging each other, upon which ''Concorde'' came up under her stern and forced her to surrender. She was discovered to be the 40-gun [[French frigate Virginie (1794)|''Virginie'']], under Captain Jacques Bergeret.&lt;ref name=&quot;James325&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James |title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The captured French ship was towed to port and taken into the navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;James325&quot;/&gt;

===Later years===
Command of ''Concorde'' passed from Hunt to Captain Richard Bagot in November 1796, and he in turn was succeeded by Captain Batholomew Roberts in June 1797.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; ''Concorde'' captured the 4-gun [[privateer]] ''Poisson Volant'' off [[Cape Finisterre]] on 24 July 1797.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; She was bound from [[Bordeaux]] to [[Guadeloupe]] carrying wines and merchandise, after which she intended to cruise as a privateer in the West Indies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debrett&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Debrett |title=A Collection of State Papers: Relative to the War against France|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Concorde'' was later commanded by Captain Robert Barton, who took a number of privateers in a series of cruises in the West Indies in 1798, capturing the 16-gun ''Caye du Pont'' off [[Saint Barthélemy|St Bartholomew]] on 3 January, the 8-gun ''Proserpine'' off [[Montserrat]] on 8 January, the 8-gun ''Hardi'' off [[Barbuda]] on 11 February, the 2-gun ''Hazard'' off Montserrat on 13 February and the 2-gun ''Rosière'' off Montserrat on 1 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; In an action with {{HMS|Lapwing|1785|6}} on 8 and 9 September she captured four privateers, the 8-gun ''Buonaparte'', 10-gun ''Amazone'', 4-gun ''Sauveur'' and 2-gun ''Fortune''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;

''Concorde''{{'}}s success against privateers continued with the capture of the 18-gun ''Prudente'' on 14 February 1799 and the 6-gun ''San Josef'' off [[Oporto]] in December 1800 and the 1-gun ''San Miguel el Volante'' on 1 December 1800.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;  ''Concorde'' had a narrow escape from a French squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Honoré Joseph Antoine Ganteaume]], which had sailed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 23 January 1801. The French sighted ''Concorde'' off [[Cape Finisterre]] on 27 January, and the 40-gun [[French frigate Bravoure (1795)|''Bravoure'']] was sent to chase her down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schomberg491&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schomberg|title=Naval Chronology|page=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Concorde'' cast off a Swedish ship she was towing and drew the French frigate away from the main body of the fleet. Barton then turned and engaged her for forty minutes, silencing her guns. By now the main French fleet was fast approaching, and with his sails and rigging damaged, Barton did not attempt to take possession of ''Bravoure'' and instead made for a British port to report the encounter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schomberg492&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schomberg|title=Naval Chronology|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Concorde'' had four men killed and 19 wounded in the engagement, while ''Bravoure'' had 10 killed and 24 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schomberg492&quot;/&gt;

==Napoleonic Wars==
Captain John Wood succeeded Barton in 1802, and the following year ''Concorde'' went out to the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt; On 7 November 1804, she captured the 24-gun privateer ''Fortune'', under [[François-Thomas Le Même]], after a ten-hour running battle.&lt;ref name=cunat409&gt;Cunat, p.409&lt;/ref&gt; In the battle ''Fortune'' lost two men killed and had four wounded; ''Concorde'' had no casualties. ''Fortune'' also suffered extensive damage to her rigging. A few days earlier at [[Kish Island|Qais Island]] ''Fortune'' had captured and scuttled ''Fly'', a 14-gun brig belonging to the [[Bombay Marine]] of the British [[East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 14, pp.291-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Wood received his prisoners &quot;with distinction&quot; and ''Concorde'' returned to Bombay. ''Fortune'', reduced to a poor condition, limped in several days later.&lt;ref name=cunat409 /&gt;

''Concorde'' was under Captain John Cramer, probably from February 1806. She was still in the East Indies in 1807, where in July she captured the 2-gun privateer ''Vigilant''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;

==Fate==
''Concorde'' returned to England and was paid off in September 1807. She spent several years laid up in [[Reserve fleet|Ordinary]]. The Navy sold her at [[Deptford Dockyard|Deptford]] on 21 February 1811.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} ''Concorde''{{'}}s sisters were the [[French frigate Hermione (1779)|''Hermione'']] and [[HMS Courageux (1799)|''Courageuse'']]. ''Hermione'' was wrecked in 1793, while ''Courageuse'' was captured during the [[Siege of Toulon]], but was retaken in the fall of the city to the French. She was retaken by the British while sailing in the Mediterranean in 1799 and taken into the navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;/&gt;

'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} Stott was badly wounded in the engagement, losing a piece of his ear, and his hearing and eyesight to the resulting swelling. A ball remained lodged in his head, and he died shortly aftwerwards on [[Hispaniola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schomberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schomberg|title=Naval Chronology|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; A young [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] was serving in the West Indies at the time, and wrote to his friend and patron [[William Locker (Royal Navy)|William Locker]] about the captures, noting that William Williams, commander of ''Active'' had also died shortly afterwards, apparently of a broken heart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot;/&gt; The heavy British losses at the time speeded Nelson's own promotion, and he was made master and commander of the [[brig]] {{HMS|Badger|1777|6}} on 8 December 1778.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot;/&gt;

'''C.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}} ''Minerva'' was retaken on 4 January 1781 and was renamed HMS ''Recovery''.&lt;ref name=&quot;College2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=College |title=Ships of the Royal Navy|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Active'' spent the rest of her career with the French Navy, until being condemned and broken up in November 1794.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield2&quot;/&gt;

'''D.''' {{Note label|D|d|none}} This was not Strachan's first encounter with ''Résolue''. While serving in the East Indies in command of the 36-gun {{HMS|Phoenix|1783|6}} in November 1791 Strachan received orders to stop and search a French convoy, escorted by ''Résolue'', which was believed to be carrying supplies for the support of [[Tipu Sultan]], whom the British were then fighting in the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]]. ''Résolue'' resisted and [[Battle of Tellicherry|a brief action took place]] before the French surrendered. As Britain and France were not at war, ''Résolue'' was then restored to the French.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Strachan, Sir Richard John|chapterurl=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26620|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/26620|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
