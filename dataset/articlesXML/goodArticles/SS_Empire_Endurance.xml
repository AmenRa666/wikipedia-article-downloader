'''''Empire Endurance''''' was a {{GRT|8,514}} [[cargo liner]] that was built in 1928 as '''''Alster''''' by [[Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau|Deschimag Werk Vulkan]], [[Hamburg]], Germany for the shipping company [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]]. In the years leading up to the [[World War II|Second World War]] ''Alster'' carried cargo and passengers between Germany and Australia. After the outbreak of war she was requisitioned by the [[Kriegsmarine]] for use as a supply ship.

''Alster'' was captured off Norway on 10 April 1940 by the British destroyer {{HMS|Icarus|D03|6}}. Initially serving under the original name as a repair, supply and cargo ship in Norway, she was later passed to the [[Ministry of War Transport]] (MoWT) and renamed ''Empire Endurance''. She served until 20 April 1941 when she was [[torpedo]]ed and sunk by the German submarine {{GS|U-73|1940|2}} south-east of the islet of [[Rockall]] in the North Atlantic Ocean.

==Description==
The ship was a {{GRT|8,514}} [[cargo liner]]. She was built in 1928 by [[Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau|Deschimag Werk Vulkan]], [[Hamburg]] as ''Alster'',&lt;ref name=Uboat/&gt;&lt;ref name=kludas&gt;Kludas 1998, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alster30&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30b0049.pdf |title=Lloyd's Register, Steamers &amp; Motorships |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with yard number 211.&lt;ref name=kludas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Miramar&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=1164841|shipname=Alster |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alster'' was {{convert|509.9|ft|m|2}} long, with a beam of {{convert|63.6|ft|m|2}}. She had a depth of {{convert|30.9|ft|m|2}}&lt;!--, and a draught of {{convert|xx|ft|x|in|m|2}}--&gt;. She was assessed at {{GRT|8,514}}, {{NRT|5,328}},&lt;ref name=Alster30/&gt; 12,000 [[deadweight tonnage|DWT]].&lt;ref name=Ships&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mitchell |first1=W.H. |last2=Sawyer |first2=L.A. |year=1995 |title=The Empire Ships |page=not cited |publisher= Lloyd's of London Press Ltd |location= London, New York, Hamburg, Hong Kong |isbn=1-85044-275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had four [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], a single [[Chimney|funnel]], a round [[stern]] and a slanted [[Stem (ship)|stem]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwadtke 1974, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was propelled by a 1,000 [[nominal horsepower|nhp]] [[triple expansion steam engine]], which had cylinders of {{convert|31+1/4|in|cm}}, {{convert|52+3/4|in|cm}} and {{convert|86+5/6|in|cm}} diameter by {{convert|57+1/16|in|cm|0}} stroke. The engine was also made by the shipbuilder.&lt;ref name=Alster30/&gt; A low pressure [[steam turbine]] drove the ship's single screw propeller through double reduction gearing and a hydraulic coupling.&lt;ref name=Endurance40/&gt; She had a total of 6,500 [[indicated horsepower]], which gave her a top speed of {{convert|14|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Miramar/&gt;&lt;ref name=schwadtke689&gt;Schwadtke 1974, p. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Alster'' was launched on 5 January 1928, and completed on 25 February 1928.&lt;ref name=Uboat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/881.html |title=Empire Endurance |publisher=Uboat |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kludas/&gt; She was built for [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]].&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; The [[Code Letters]] QMHG were allocated and her port of registry was [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name=Alster30/&gt; She served on routes between Germany and Australia and [[East Asia]].&lt;ref name=kludas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times070828&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Shipping |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=7 August 1928 |page_number=2 |issue=44962 |column=B }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lloyds Register]] entries show that she held a passenger certificate from 1934–40. With the change in Code Letters in 1934, ''Alster'' was allocated DOEO as her callsign.&lt;ref name=Alster37&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=37b0040.pdf |title=Lloyd's Register, Steamers &amp; Motorships |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a crew of 69 and could initially take 14 passengers. In 1930 the passenger capacity was increased to 16.&lt;ref name=kludas/&gt;&lt;ref name=schwadtke689/&gt;

===Norwegian Campaign and capture===
On 18 March 1940, ''Alster'' was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine. She was used as a supply ship in [[Operation Weserübung]] - the German invasion of Norway, forming part of the invasion's {{lang|de|''Ausfuhr-Staffel''}}, transporting heavy equipment.&lt;ref name=Uboat/&gt;&lt;ref name=bcruiser&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWD-HF1940BCS1B.htm |title=Admiralty War Diaries of World War 2: Vice Admiral, Battlecruiser Squadron, Home Fleet - May to December 1940 |accessdate=8 March 2012 |last=Kindell |first=Don |date=16 July 2011 |work=Naval-History.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niehorster.org/011_germany/40-04_scandinavia/navy_ausfuhr.html |title=Scandinavian Campaign: Equipment Transport Echelon |accessdate=28 June 2015 |last=Niehorster  |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Niehorster}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alster'' departed [[Brunsbüttel]] at 02:00 on 3 April, destined for the [[Northern Norway|North Norwegian]] port of [[Narvik]]. She was one of four supply ships sailing from the [[Schleswig-Holstein Province|Schleswig-Holstein]] port in support of German forces landing at Narvik on 9 April, under cover of sailing to [[Murmansk]] in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Sandvik 1965 vol. 1, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; None of these ships made it to their destination.{{#tag:ref|The three other supply ships sailing from Brunsbüttel were {{SS|Bärenfels|1921|2}}, ''Kattegat'' and {{SS|Rauenfels|1928|2}}. In addition to these, the tanker ''Jan Wellem'' sailed from the German [[Basis Nord]] near Murmansk. ''Jan Wellem'' was the only German supply ship to reach its destination before the invasion began. While ''Alster'' was captured, ''Bärenfels'' was redirected to Bergen, ''Kattegat'' was sunk by the Norwegian patrol boat {{HNoMS|Nordkapp}} and ''Rauenfels'' was knocked out by the destroyer {{HMS|Havock|H43|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde 2009, pp. 188&amp;ndash;189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haarr 2009, pp. 66, 68&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} The lack of supplies and artillery would leave the German forces [[Battles of Narvik|fighting at Narvik]] vulnerable. Upon reaching Norwegian waters, ''Alster'' and the tanker [[MS Kattegat (1928)|''Kattegat'']], also bound for Narvik, was escorted by the Norwegian torpedo boat [[HNoMS Trygg (1919)|HNoMS ''Trygg'']] as far as [[Kopervik]], where they arrived on 5 April. At Kopervik the German plans suffered a delay because of a lack of [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] to guide the ship northwards, ''Alster'' continuing later that day, while ''Kattegat'' departed Kopervik only on 6 April. Many of the other supply ships sent out in advance of the invasion also suffered delays, putting the supply part of the invasion plans out of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4004-13APR01.htm |title=Naval Events, April 1940, Part 1 of 4 Monday 1st – Sunday 7th |accessdate=8 March 2012 |last=Kindell |first=Don |date=17 September 2008 |work=Naval-History.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steen43&gt;Steen 1958, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; While at Kopervik, ''Alster'' and ''Kattegat'' were inspected by the torpedo boat {{HNoMS|Stegg|1921|6}}, the Norwegians finding nothing irregular.&lt;ref name=Steen43/&gt; By 8 April, ''Alster'' had reached [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjorden]], where she was hailed by the Norwegian patrol boat {{HNoMS|Syrian}}, which warned her of the British naval minefield [[Operation Wilfred|laid in the area]] earlier that day. ''Alster'' steamed to Bodø, to await developments. Two days later, on 10 April, following the outbreak of war between Norway and Germany the previous day, ''Syrian'' was despatched to seize ''Alster'' off Bodø. When ''Syrian'' found ''Alster'', the commander of the small Norwegian patrol boat chose not to board the German vessel as he suspected she was armed and possibly carrying troops. As ''Alster'' attempted to escape, ''Syrian'' sent out messages to the British warships in the area.&lt;ref name=april2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4004-13APR02.htm |title=Naval Events, April 1940, Part 2 of 4 Monday 8th - Sunday 14th |accessdate=8 March 2012 |last=Kindell |first=Don |date=17 September 2008 |work=Naval-History.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Vollan 1999, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haarr 2009, pp. 66, 333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pedersen224&gt;Pedersen 2009, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steen 1958, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April, ''Alster'' was captured by the British destroyer {{HMS|Icarus|D03|6}} in Vestfjorden, north of Bodø.

On 16 May a request was made to the [[Admiralty]] for a call sign for ''Alster'', the ship departing Tromsø the next day for [[Kirkenes]] in [[Finnmark]], escorted by the [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] whaler {{HMS|Ullswater||6}}. She was despatched to the northern port to retrieve a cargo of [[iron ore]]. Arriving on 19 May 1940, ''Alster'' loaded some 10,000 tons of iron ore over four days, sailing south to the port of [[Harstad]] on 22 May, still escorted by HMS ''Ullswater'', as well as the Norwegian patrol boat {{HNoMS|Nordhav II}}. On 23 May, the British submarine [[HMS Truant (N68)|HMS ''Truant'']] made an unsuccessful attack with two torpedoes on ''Alster'' off [[Havøya]], despite efforts having been made to both keep the cargo ship away from the submarine's patrol area, and to warn ''Truant'' of the ship's identity. The torpedoes missed, exploding when they hit land. ''Alster'' and HMS ''Ullswater'' arrived at Harstad on 26 May, with the escort vessel sailing northwards to [[Hammerfest]] with mail and provisions for the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Devonshire|39|6}}.&lt;ref name=1stcruiser/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haarr 2010, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steen 1958, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Alster'' was at Harstad shipping in the town's harbour was repeatedly subjected to attacks by ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers, the ships being defended by [[Gloster Gladiator]] fighters of the [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] operating from [[Bardufoss Air Station]] and anti-aircraft artillery. During one of the attacks on 26 May the ship's Norwegian [[Fireman (steam engine)|fireman]] was mortally wounded by [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|bomb fragments]], dying in [[Harstad Hospital]] later the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Ingebrigtsen 1995, pp. 182&amp;ndash;183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ording 1950, p. 794&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hafsten 1991, p. 95&amp;ndash;96&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May ''Alster'' sailed for the United Kingdom in a five-ship convoy which included the crippled HMS ''Eskimo''. In addition to her cargo of iron ore, the ship carried 209 British military personnel, 46 Norwegian military personnel and 72 German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. She also transported the &quot;B&quot; gun turret from ''Eskimo'', which had been removed from the destroyer during makeshift repairs. ''Alster'' arrived at [[Scapa Flow]] on 31 May, unloading her passengers there. Sailing on 3 June, in the company of the passenger steamer {{SS|St. Magnus|1924|2}} and escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Ashanti|F51|6}} and {{HMS|Bedouin|F67|6}}, she arrived at [[Rosyth]] in Scotland on 4 June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4005-14MAY04.htm |title=Naval Events, May 1940, Part 4 of 4 Wednesday 22nd – Friday 31st |accessdate=8 March 2012 |last=Kindell |first=Don |date=17 September 2008 |work=Naval-History.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4006-19JUN01.htm |title=Naval Events, June 1940, Part 1 of 4 Saturday 1st – Friday 7th |accessdate=8 March 2012 |last=Kindell |first=Don |date=19 April 2009 |work=Naval-History.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haarr 2010, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;
