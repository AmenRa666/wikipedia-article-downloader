'''SMS ''Bussard''''' (&quot;His Majesty's Ship ''Bussard''—''Buzzard''&quot;){{efn|name=SMS|}} was an [[unprotected cruiser]] of the [[Imperial German Navy]], built in the 1880s. She was the [[lead ship]] of [[Bussard-class cruiser|her class]], which included five other vessels. The cruiser's [[keel]] was laid in 1888, and she was launched in January 1890 and commissioned in October of that year. Intended for overseas duty, ''Bussard'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|10.5|cm|sp=us|adj=on}} guns, and could steam at a speed of {{convert|15.5|kn}}.

''Bussard'' served abroad for the majority of her career, first in the [[German East Asia Squadron|East Asia Division]] in the mid-1890s, and in [[German East Africa]] for the first decade of the 20th century. She had a relatively peaceful career; her only major action came while stationed in Asia in 1894. There, she assisted in suppressing a local revolt in [[Samoa]]. In 1910, she returned to Germany, where she remained in service for only two more years; she was stricken in October 1912 and scrapped the following year in [[Hamburg]].

{{main|Bussard-class cruiser}}
''Bussard'' was {{convert|82.6|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|12.5|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.45|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|1868|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 3-cylinder triple-expansion [[steam engine]]s powered by four coal-fired cylindrical boilers. These provided a top speed of {{convert|15.5|kn|abbr=on}} and a range of approximately {{convert|2990|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|9|kn|abbr=on}}. She had a crew of 9 officers and 152 enlisted men.&lt;ref name=G97&gt;Gröner, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was armed with eight [[10.5 cm K L/35|10.5&amp;nbsp;cm K L/35]] guns in single pedestal mounts, supplied with 800&amp;nbsp;rounds of ammunition in total. They had a range of {{convert|8200|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=G97/&gt; Two guns were placed side by side forward, two on each [[broadside]] in [[sponson]]s, and two side by side aft. The gun armament was rounded out by five revolver cannon.&lt;ref name=G253&gt;Gardiner, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; She was also equipped with two {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s with five torpedoes, both of which were mounted on the deck.&lt;ref name=G97/&gt;

==Service history==
''Bussard'' was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Danzig|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] (Imperial Shipyard) in [[Danzig]] under the contract name &quot;C&quot;. She was launched on 23 January 1890; [[fitting-out]] work was completed quickly, and the new cruiser was ready for commissioning into the Imperial fleet on 7 October 1890. She thereafter served on overseas stations in the German Empire.&lt;ref name=G97/&gt; Early in her career, ''Bussard'' served on the East Asia Station with the [[German East Asia Squadron|East Asia Division]]. In July 1893, she and her [[sister ship]] {{SMS|Falke||2}} assisted in the suppression of a local revolt led by [[Mata'afa Iosefo]] in [[Samoa]]. They were joined by the old British [[corvette]] {{HMS|Curacao|1878|6}}, and the three vessels bombarded rebel positions on 7 July, forcing their surrender. Mata'afa was taken to [[Apia]], the capital, while ''Bussard'' remained behind to ensure the demilitarization of his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Clowes et al., p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, ''Bussard'' returned to Germany, arriving in the [[Elbe River]] in March. On the return voyage, she carried several tropical birds for the [[Berlin Zoological Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Krämer, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; After her arrival, ''Bussard'' went into drydock at the ''Kaiserliche Werft'' in Danzig for reconstruction. The [[barque]] rig was cut down to a top-sail [[schooner]] rig. A new, larger [[conning tower]] structure was built. Work was completed by 1900, when ''Bussard'' returned to service.&lt;ref&gt;Gröner, pp. 97&amp;ndash;98&lt;/ref&gt; She was sent to China in response to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] earlier that year.&lt;ref name=S547&gt;''Sundries'', p. 547&lt;/ref&gt; While en route to China on 6 August 1900, a boiler room exploded aboard ''Bussard'', due to a blown out [[manhole]] gasket; the explosion killed three sailors and seriously wounded another three men.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in China, ''Bussard'' took part in the attack on the [[Taku Forts]], along with her sisters {{SMS|Seeadler||2}} and {{SMS|Geier||2}}. Her crew suffered no casualties during the campaign.&lt;ref name=S547/&gt;

As of 1901, ''Bussard'' was assigned to the East Africa Station in [[German East Africa]], along with the unprotected cruiser {{SMS|Schwalbe||2}}. The only other German warships in Africa at the time were the [[gunboat]]s {{SMS|Habicht||2}} and the elderly {{SMS|Wolf|1878|2}}; these two ships were stationed in [[German West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Notes'', 1901, p. 1502&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bussard'' remained on the East Africa station in 1904, and ''Schwalbe'' was replaced by her sister {{SMS|Sperber||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Notes'', 1904, p. 1079&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, [[Hans Paasche]] served as the ship's navigation officer; he held this position for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1908, ''Sperber'' had been transferred to German West Africa, and another of ''Bussard''{{'}}s sisters, ''Seeadler'', took her place alongside ''Bussard''.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Notes'', 1908, p. 710&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bussard'' remained in Africa until 1910, when she returned to Germany for a second and final time. She remained in active service for only a brief time; she was [[:wikt:stricken|stricken]] from the [[naval register]] on 25 October 1912 and was broken up for scrap the following year in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=G97/&gt;
